The '''1985 Brussels summit''' was the 7th [[NATO summit]] bringing the leaders of member nations together at the same time.  The formal sessions and informal meetings in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] took place on November 21, 1985.&lt;ref name="nato1"&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO summit meetings |author=NATO |url=http://www.nato.int/issues/summits/index.html#agendas |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gWo4KcXm?url=http://www.nato.int/issues/summits/index.html |archivedate=2009-05-04 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This event was only the seventh meeting of the NATO heads of state following the ceremonial signing of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] on April 4, 1949.&lt;ref name="thomas101"&gt;Thomas, Ian Q.R.

==Background==
In this period, the organization faced unresolved questions concerned whether a new generation of leaders would be as committed to NATO as their predecessors had been.&lt;ref name="thomas101"/&gt;  Generational change in the leadership of the Soviet Union brought [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mwYQSw00m8EC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=NATO+and+Brussels+summit+1974&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA130,M1  p. 130.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were disturbances before and after two international [[association football]] matches between [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in November 2009, leading to diplomatic tensions between Egypt, Algeria, and Sudan. The matches were in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - CAF Third Round#Group C|Group C]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|the CAF section]] of [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|the qualifying competition]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

The first match, the final scheduled match in Group C, took place in [[Cairo]] on 14 November, with Egypt winning 2–0. The result left Egypt and Algeria tied for first place in Group C, necessitating a [[One-game playoff|playoff match]] in a neutral country. This took place in [[Omdurman]], [[Sudan]] on 18 November, with Algeria winning 1–0 and thus qualifying for the World Cup final tournament in South Africa in June 2010.

==Rivalry==
The countries are both in North Africa, only separated by [[Libya]], and football matches between them are fiercely contested [[local derby|local derbies]].&lt;ref name="thelede13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/egypt-and-algeria-brace-for-match-of-hate-sequel/ |title=Violence Flares Ahead of Algeria-Egypt Soccer Match |last=Mackey |first=Robert |date=13 November 2009 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=27 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117173035/http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/egypt-and-algeria-brace-for-match-of-hate-sequel/ |archivedate=17 November 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edition.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/football/11/20/egypt.algeria.inside.story/index.html |title=Egypt versus Algeria: Inside the storm |last=Montague |first=James |date=20 November 2009|publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=27 November 2009|location=Cairo| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091130054513/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/football/11/20/egypt.algeria.inside.story/index.html| archivedate= 30 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dart17"/&gt; Although both have long been among Africa's stronger sides, each had experienced a long drought without World Cup qualification: Algeria since [[1986 World Cup|1986]] and Egypt since [[1990 World Cup|1990]].&lt;ref name="Black"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dahshan"/&gt;

In 1989, Egypt beat Algeria in [[1990 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)#Final round|a decisive qualifying match]] for the [[1990 World Cup]]. Player [[Ayman Younes]] later said, "It was a battle, not a football match."&lt;ref name="Montague1"/&gt; Algerians felt the Tunisian referee was biased; fans rioted in the stands.&lt;ref name="Montague1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/features/egypt_against_algeria_revives_some_bitter_memories_part_one_by_james_montague_features_290898.html |title=Egypt against Algeria revives some bitter memories |last=Montague |first=James |publisher=[[World Soccer Magazine|World Soccer]] |accessdate=27 November 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091117201441/http://www.worldsoccer.com/features/egypt_against_algeria_revives_some_bitter_memories_part_one_by_james_montague_features_290898.html| archivedate= 17 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Algerian player attacked an Egyptian fan.&lt;ref name="el-Khaky"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTQbpQheqn4 |format=[[YouTube]] |first=Amr |last=el-Khaky |location=Cairo |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009 |title=Rivalries persist at Cairo football match }}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria's [[Lakhdar Belloumi]] was convicted [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] for a glass attack which blinded Egypt's team doctor in one eye.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; He remained subject to an [[Interpol]] arrest warrant, although he claimed goalkeeper [[Kamel Kadri]] had been the true perpetrator.&lt;ref name="Montague1"/&gt;

For political analyst [[Ziad Majed]], the tension dates from [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] days when he sent Egyptian teachers to help arabize Algeria after its independence. These teachers contributed to the rise of political Islam in Algeria, ultimately leading to the Algerian civil war.&lt;ref name="majed"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ziadmajed.blogspot.com/2009/11/blog-post_24.html |title=Algeria - Egypt...

==Blida match==
Algeria's home match against Egypt in the 2010 qualifiers took place in June 2009 without any incident being reported. Rather, to cool down animosity between the two countries, the Egyptian team was received with flowers at the airport. Diplomatic agreement, with personal intervention from Algerian president [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], included lifting the Interpol warrant on Belloumi and compensating the Egyptian team doctor.&lt;ref name="Montague1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; Both teams prepared for the match away from the pressure of intense local fans; Egypt in [[Oman]], Algeria in France.&lt;ref name="Echorouk"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.echoroukonline.com/eng/index.php?news=6727|title=2010 World Cup : Algeria, Egypt face off in a classic North African derby |last=B. |first=Med. |work=[[Echorouk]] online |accessdate=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria coach [[Rabah Saadane]] wept at a press conference, expressing fear for his family's safety in the event of defeat.&lt;ref name="Echorouk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1863/world-cup-2010confederations-cup/2009/06/05/1306308/world-cup-qualifying-preview-algeria-egypt |title=World Cup Qualifying Preview: Algeria – Egypt |last=Ayari |first=Rami |date=5 June 2009 |work=Goal.com |accessdate=2 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 5,000 security personnel turned [[Blida]] into a "virtual military base".&lt;ref name="Belmary"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/06/07/75162.html |title=Egypt faces Algeria in tense World Cup qualifier |last=Belmary |first=Ramadan |date=7 June 2009 |publisher=[[Al Arabiya]] |accessdate=2 December 2009 |location=Algiers }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minors were barred from the stadium unless they had a ticket.&lt;ref name="Belmary"/&gt; Algeria won 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1863/world-cup-2010/2009/06/07/1311469/world-cup-2010-egypt-humbled-by-three-goal-algeria |title=World Cup 2010: Egypt Humbled By Three-Goal Algeria |last=Pedroncelli |first=Peter |date=7 June 2009 |work=Goal.com|accessdate=2 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt's leading state-owned daily ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' charged on Friday that it was the Algerian players, not stonethrowers, who had caused the damage to the bus. "The bus carrying the team from the airport to the hotel was at the centre of a strange incident in which some of the players started to smash the vehicle's windows claiming that they were the target of stonethrowing", the paper reported. The independent daily ''[[Al-Shuruq]]'' went further, saying the whole episode was a "complete fabrication." Citing a "senior security source", the paper said the windows of the bus were smashed "from the inside not the outside as claimed by Algerian team members." It accused the players of a "complete fabrication intended to serve as an excuse in the event that they lose" Saturday's key decider for next year's World Cup finals in South Africa.&lt;ref name="egyptpress"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jpx0j26RGheW0iTMq-K9FkjCBLig Egypt press says Algerian team faked bus attack], by Ines bel Aiba, AFP, 13-11-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent ''[[Almasry Alyoum|Al-Masry Al-Youm]]'' newspaper acknowledged that some "kids" had thrown stones but charged that the Algerian players had then put on a "display of histrionics pretending to be scared and injured, and smashing up the bus's windows and seats." The state-owned ''[[Al Gomhuria]]'' said the players had even assaulted the bus driver.&lt;ref name="egyptpress" /&gt;

Counterclaims included footage shot by [[Canal+]] for its documentary about the Algerian team&lt;ref name="thelede13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8359265.stm |title= World Cup footballers under attack |date=13 November 2009|publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]] |accessdate=27 November 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091121163905/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8359265.stm| archivedate= 21 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cellphone footage shot by [[Rafik Saïfi]].&lt;ref name="thelede13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goal.com/en/news/1863/world-cup-2010/2009/11/12/1621127/video-algeria-player-rafik-saifi-produces-video-of-bus |title=Algeria Player Rafik Saifi Produces Video Of Bus Attack |date=12 November 2009 |publisher=Goal.com |accessdate=27 November 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091203090819/http://www.goal.com/en/news/1863/world-cup-2010/2009/11/12/1621127/video-algeria-player-rafik-saifi-produces-video-of-bus| archivedate= 3 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA observer Walter Gagg said, "We saw that three players had been injured — [[Khaled Lemmouchia]] on the head, [[Rafik Halliche]] above the eye and [[Rafik Saïfi]] on the arm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bikyamasr.com/?p=5768 |title= Late goal gives Egypt enough for win, World Cup playoff  |date=15 November 2009 |work=Bikya Masr |accessdate=1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial reporting following the incident likely led to further poisoning the build-up to Saturday's game. The pre-match atmosphere in Egypt had already surged to feverish heights amid an unprecedented level of tension between the North African rivals.&lt;ref name="egyptpress" /&gt;

[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Egypt)|Egyptian foreign ministry]] spokesman Hossam Zaki had specifically called for responsible coverage by both countries' media as the two governments issued joint appeals for calm. Egyptian and Algerian media "hold a responsibility in this regard and must work to maintain the strong ties between both countries and should not fuel disagreements that are unrelated to sports and sportsmanship", Zaki said.&lt;ref name="egyptpress" /&gt;

That same evening just outside Cairo, Algeria's "king of rai" [[Khaled (musician)|Cheb Khaled]] performed alongside Egyptian star [[Mohamed Mounir]] to a packed audience of nearly 45,000 people, according to organisers. "Long live Egypt, Arab country, long live Algeria, Arab country", Cheb Khaled shouted to the crowd, with little apparent impact on home fan passions ahead of the game.&lt;ref name="egyptpress" /&gt;

[[Egyptian Football Association]] board member Mahmoud Taher later indicated that "all Algeria players are safe. They were not hurt. Algeria is trying to blow things out of proportion. The bus is damaged from inside, so it is obvious that they were the ones who did that to escalate the matter. FIFA has not contacted Egypt as recently reported, and there aren't any intentions to call off the game."&lt;ref name="filgoal"&gt;[http://new.filgoal.com/English/News.aspx?NewsID=61503 No Algerian players were injured - EFA], by Hatem Maher, FilGoal.com, 12-11-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Khairi Morsi, the Egyptian driver who drove the Algerian delegation's bus, said the Algerian team had assaulted him. He indicated to Modern Sport TV that "they also shattered the windows from inside when they saw some Egyptian people around the bus."&lt;ref name="filgoal" /&gt;

On Friday 13 November, FIFA declared the match would go ahead as scheduled, but "asked the Egyptian Football Association and the highest national authorities through the relevant ministries to provide written guarantees that confirm the implementation of the necessary additional safety and security measures at any time for the Algerian delegation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1133115.html |title=Egypt-Algeria Media Statement |date=13 November 2009 |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=27 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116171840/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid%3D1133115.html |archivedate=16 November 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemmouchia and Halliche played with bandaged heads.&lt;ref name="leicester"/&gt; Team doctor Michel Gaillaud said the players were mentally unfit and the match should not have gone ahead.&lt;ref name="leicester"/&gt;

As a result of these events, on 18 May 2010, the [[FIFA Disciplinary Code|FIFA Disciplinary Committee]] sanctioned and fined the [[Egyptian Football Association]] for not adopting the necessary measures to prevent the assault on the bus of the [[Algeria national football team|Algerian delegation]] on the way from the airport to the hotel on 12 November 2009. The report would also admonish the Egyptian Football Association for failures in maintaining security and order in the [[Cairo International Stadium]] for the game between Egypt and Algeria held on 14 November 2009. This would result in a two-game ban for the Egyptian national football team whereby the first two home matches of the preliminary competition for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil would be played at a location at least 100 kilometres away from Cairo.&lt;ref name="fifaban"&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/organisation/media/newsid=1213553/ Egypt to play two matches outside Cairo], by FIFA.com, 18-05-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine the match venue, each team selected a country other than their own (Algeria selected [[Tunisia]] and Egypt selected [[Sudan]]).

The '''2015 Oklahoma State University homecoming parade crash''' was a [[vehicle collision]] that occurred on October 24, 2015, in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], when a driver drove into a crowd watching the [[homecoming]] [[parade]] for [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater]] on the university's campus.&lt;ref name="newspress-osucrash"&gt;{{cite news|title=Update: At least three dead, multiple people injured after car plows into Homecoming parade|url=http://www.stwnewspress.com/news/update-at-least-three-dead-multiple-people-injured-after-car/article_8fc4ca56-7a6a-11e5-a6b1-47c936d793c7.html|author=David Bitton|newspaper=[[NewsPress|Stillwater News-Press]]|publisher=[[Community Newspaper Holdings]]|date=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four people were killed in the crash, and 46 others were reported injured.&lt;ref name="koco-osucrash"&gt;{{cite news|title=4th victim, a 2-year-old, dies after OSU homecoming crash|url=http://www.koco.com/news/several-hurt-in-crash-at-osu-parade/36027322|author=Zak Patterson|website=[[KOCO-TV]]|publisher=[[Hearst Television]]|date=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kfor-osucrash"&gt;{{cite news|title=Four dead and dozens injured, one in custody after wreck during OSU homecoming parade in Stillwater|url=http://kfor.com/2015/10/24/two-dead-and-dozens-injured-during-osu-homecoming-parade-in-stillwater/|website=[[KFOR-TV]]|publisher=[[Tribune Broadcasting]]|date=October 24, 2015|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-osucrash"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oklahoma State Homecoming shattered as car kills 4 spectators, including 2-year-old|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/10/25/oklahoma-state-homecoming-shattered-as-car-kills-4-spectators-including-2-year-old/|author=Cindy Boren|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Jeff Bezos|Nash Holdings, LLC]]|date=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
The incident occurred at 10:31&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]] (1531 [[Universal Coordinated Time|UTC]]), during Oklahoma State University's annual Sea of Orange Homecoming Parade, which was being held that morning, leading up to that day's [[college football|football]] game between the [[2015 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State Cowboys]] and the [[2015 Kansas Jayhawks football team|Kansas Jayhawks]]. After the parade had crossed the intersection of Hall of Fame Avenue and Main Streets ({{convert|0.40|mi|km}} east of [[Boone Pickens Stadium]]) on the university campus, where the parade was supposed to conclude, 25-year-old Adacia Avery Chambers – a native of [[Oologah, Oklahoma|Oologah]] and resident of Stillwater – drove her gray 2014 [[Hyundai Elantra]] south on Main at speeds above {{convert|40|mph|kph}} into several barriers used to block off commuter traffic and then proceeded to hit an unmanned [[motorcycle]] belonging to the Stillwater Police Department, which was providing security assistance for the event; Chambers' car then careened into approximately 50 parade spectators before stopping when its two front tires popped the curb on the southwest corner of the intersection.&lt;ref name="newspress-osucrash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kfor-osucrash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-osucrash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-osucrash"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police release names of dead, injured from Oklahoma State tragedy – many children|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/24/us/oklahoma-car-into-crowd/|author=Jason Hanna|author2=Kevin Conlon|website=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|date=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oklahoma State copes with losses from Homecoming Parade tragedy|url=http://okcfox.com/news/local/oklahoma-state-copes-with-losses-from-homecoming-parade-tragedy|author=Mireya Garcia|website=[[KOKH-TV]]|publisher=[[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]|date=October 24, 2015|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local paramedics and firefighters participating in the parade immediately began tending to those who were injured. Three of the victims who were hit by Chambers' vehicle in the collision – 23-year-old Nikita Prabhaker Nakal, a native of [[Mumbai]], [[India]] who was an attending senior at the [[University of Central Oklahoma]] in [[Edmond, Oklahoma|Edmond]]; and husband and wife Marvin Lyle and Bonnie Jean Stone, both age 65 and residing in Stillwater – died at the scene; 2-year-old Nash Lucas, also of Stillwater, suffered severe injuries and died while being treated at [[OU Medicine#The Children's Hospital at OU Medicine|The Children's Hospital at OU Medicine]] in [[Oklahoma City]] hours after the crash (his mother was among those injured in the crash). 47 other people – including nine children between the ages of 1 and 13 – were admitted for various injuries at Stillwater Medical Center; [[OU Medicine#OU Medical Center|OU Medical Center]] and The Children's Hospital in Oklahoma City; and St. Johns Medical Center in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]]. The intersection was subsequently blocked off by Stillwater and university law enforcement.&lt;ref name="koco-osucrash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-osucrash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-osucrash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newspress-osucrashrelease"&gt;{{cite news|title= City of Stillwater releases names and conditions of homecoming parade accident victims|url=http://www.stwnewspress.com/news/city-of-stillwater-releases-names-and-conditions-of-homecoming-parade/article_3b68b3a6-7b22-11e5-8b17-877f937812d8.html|newspaper=Stillwater News-Press|publisher=Community Newspaper Holdings|date=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Centralities from President Betz for Saturday, Oct. 24, 2015|url=http://blasts.uco.edu/centralities/special-centralities-from-president-betz-for-saturday,-oct.-24,-2015.html|website=[[University of Central Oklahoma]]|date=October 24, 2015|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday-osucrash"&gt;{{cite news|title=3 dead after driver plows into Oklahoma State homecoming parade|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/big12/2015/10/24/fatal-car-crash-kills-two-at-oklahoma-state-homecoming-parade/74532230/|author=Jim Varney|author2=Trevor Hughes|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oklahoma State University Parade Turns Deadly as Car Crash Kills 4|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/us/3-killed-as-car-plows-into-crowd-at-oklahoma-state-university.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=October 24, 2015|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPDATED: OU Medical Center, Stillwater Medical Center release information about patients involved with fatal crash at OSU homecoming parade|url=http://www.ocolly.com/news/article_9e634610-7a91-11e5-b982-23690f141bed.html|newspaper=The O'Colly|publisher=[[Oklahoma State University]]|date=October 24, 2015|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Legal proceedings===
Chambers was arrested near the crash site by Stillwater Police Department officers present at the scene of the accident on suspicion of [[driving under the influence]]; she was later placed into a detox unit in the [[Payne County, Oklahoma|Payne County]] Jail. Results of blood tests to gauge the levels of any alcohol or narcotic intoxicants in Chambers' body – a requirement for police to administer for "serious" vehicle accidents involving a fatality under Oklahoma state law – revealed she had a blood alcohol level of .01, not enough to be charged with driving under the influence. Chambers was arraigned at Payne County District Court on October 26, with any additional charges against her pending further investigation into the cause of the collision that is presented to the Payne County District Attorney's office.&lt;ref name="usatoday-osucrash"/&gt; Chambers was charged with four counts of second-degree murder and 46 charges of assault.&lt;ref name="people1211"/&gt; Her bail was set at $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/latest-suspect-oklahoma-state-crash-due-court-062806594.html|title=The Latest: DA says Oklahoma parade deaths seem intentional|publisher=[[Yahoo News]]|date=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her trial was scheduled to begin January 10, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/100s-witnesses-expected-oklahoma-parade-crash-trial-135352623.html|title=100s of witnesses named in Oklahoma parade crash trial|publisher=[[Yahoo News]]|date=September 16, 2016|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 10, 2017, she was sentenced to life in prison after accepting a plea deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/adacia-chambers-oklahoma-state-homecoming-crash-sentenced/|title=Adacia Chambers sentenced in deadly Oklahoma State homecoming crash|publisher=CBS NEWS|date=January 10, 2017|accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 2017, Adacia Avery Chambers pleaded no contest to four counts of second-degree murder and 39 counts of assault and battery by means or force likely to produce death. Chambers received life in prison for each murder count, to be served concurrently, and 10 years in prison for each assault count, to also be served concurrently. The plea agreement ensures Chambers will serve a 55-year sentence and will not leave prison until her early 70s, pending parole for both the life sentence and assault sentence.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsok.com/article/5533802&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
During a [[press conference]] on the crash held that afternoon, [[Burns Hargis]], president of Oklahoma State University, stated, "Tragically we lost three. I hope we don't lose anymore. [...] The Cowboy family pulls together, unfortunately, we’ve had to do it before, and we're going to do it again." Stillwater mayor Gina Noble, who had served as the parade's [[grand marshal]], later remarked that "We are heartbroken at this tragedy." Noble later commented, "We’ve never seen anything like this. [...] We’re shocked. We are definitely subdued in mood and we’re still trying to understand. [...] We will get through this together and figure out how to help those who need the help."&lt;ref name="usatoday-osucrash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews=osucrash"&gt;{{cite news|title=3 dead, 22 injured in crash at OSU parade; woman taken into custody for DUI|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/10/24/multiple-injuries-reported-in-crash-at-osu-homecoming-parade/|website=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]|publisher=Fox News Networks, LLC|date=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The homecoming football game between [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]] and [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]] – in which the Cowboys defeated the Jayhawks, 58-10 – was played as scheduled at 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. that afternoon; a [[pep rally]] originally set to be held before the game was cancelled, however. Before the game (which was televised nationally on [[Fox Sports 1|FS1]]), [[Governor of Oklahoma|Oklahoma Governor]] [[Mary Fallin]], an alumna of the university who was in attendance at the game, led players and spectators in a moment of prayer as the [[Flag of the United States|United States flag]] flew at half staff in Boone Pickens Stadium.&lt;ref name="usatoday-osucrash"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=OSU-KU game will go on|url=http://newsok.com/article/5455779|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|publisher=The Anschutz Corporation|date=October 24, 2015|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallin expressed condolences during a press conference that occurred during [[halftime]] of the game, "Our hearts and prayers go out with those who lost loved ones today, to those that were injured in the tragedy," and referenced the two previous tragedies involving the university during the past 14 years (the [[Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball team plane crash|January 2001 plane crash]] that killed ten members of the [[Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball|Cowboys basketball team]] and the [[Oklahoma State Cowgirls basketball team plane crash|November 2011 plane crash]] that killed four people, including [[Oklahoma State Cowgirls basketball|Cowgirls basketball]] head coach [[Kurt Budke]] and assistant coach Miranda Serna), adding "One thing I do know about Oklahoma people. They’re strong. They're very compassionate. They believe in prayer. They believe in comforting people and helping during a time of crisis and need. We’ll get through this again. But certainly it’s a very painful experience for those of us here, and certainly for all Oklahomans."&lt;ref name="usatoday-osucrash"/&gt;

The '''Bel Air Fire''' was a disaster that began as a brush fire on November 5, 1961 in the [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] community of [[Los Angeles]]. 484 homes were destroyed and {{convert|16,900|acres|km2}} were burned. The fire was fueled by strong [[Santa Ana wind]]s.&lt;ref name=LAFD1&gt;{{cite news|title=Bel Air Fire|url=http://www.lafdmuseum.org/bel-air-fire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230004328/http://www.lafdmuseum.org/bel-air-fire|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-12-30|first=|last=staff|date=2014|work=[[Los Angeles Fire Department Museum and Memorial|Los Angeles Fire Department Historical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were multiple celebrities affected by the fire. Actors [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Joan Fontaine]], and [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], comedian [[Joe E. Brown]], Nobel laureate chemist [[Willard Libby]] and composer [[Lukas Foss]] lost homes in the fire. Others that fought flames before they evacuated were former Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], actor [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], film producer Keith Daniels and singer [[Billy Vaughn]].&lt;ref name=LAT1&gt;{{cite news |title=Bel Air Fire - Framework|url=http://framework.latimes.com/2010/11/07/bel-air-fire/|first1=Scott|last1=Harrison|date= November 7, 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
As a result of the Bel Air Fire, Los Angeles initiated a series of laws and fire safety policies.  These included the banning of [[wood shingle]] roofs in new construction and one of the most stringent brush clearance policies in the US.&lt;ref name=LAFD1/&gt;

The [[Los Angeles City Fire Department]] produced a documentary, "Design For Disaster", about the wildfire, narrated by [[William Conrad]].

[[File:Bulls_Ishikawa,_Okinawa_2007.jpg|thumb|''Tōgyū'', or "Okinawan bullfighting", is a traditional sport of [[Japan]].]]
'''Bull wrestling''', '''cow fighting''' or '''bull fighting''' is a non-lethal [[bloodsport]] between [[bull]]s or [[cow]]s found in some parts of the world.

[[File:Sanski Most Korida 2011 006.JPG|thumb|Korida in [[Sanski Most]], Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
''Korida'', from ''corrida'', or ''borbe bikova'' ("fights of bulls") is a traditional sport in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]]. 

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
[[Grmeč]], a mountain in the extreme west of [[Bosnia]], is the best-known site of bullfights in the [[Balkans]]. They are called the ''Korida of Grmeč'' (''Grmečka korida'') and have been organised on every first Sunday in August for over 200 years, attracting thousands of visitors. These are fights between bulls themselves and there is no death of a bull. Fights happen in an empty field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlasobscura.com/place/bullfights-of-grmec |title=Bullfights of Grmec |work=Atlas Obscura |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The korida of [[Grmeč]] was depicted by the sculptor [[Slobodan Pejić]]. The sculpture of two bulls in a fight, made in bronze in 2004, has been compared to a confrontation of the oppressor and the oppressed or of the Bosnian people and the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sl icon}} Vanda Mušič (ed).

===Croatia===
In Croatia, koridas are traditionally organized in [[Dalmatian Hinterland]] region. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=(www.dw.com)|first1=Deutsche Welle|title=Nepoznata atrakcija u Hrvatskoj: Borbe bikova {{!}} Panorama {{!}} DW {{!}} 26.07.2017|url=http://www.dw.com/bs/nepoznata-atrakcija-u-hrvatskoj-borbe-bikova/a-39837182|website=DW.COM|language=bs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
Bull wrestling in Turkey is known as ''[[:tr:Boğa güreşi#T.C3.BCrkiye.27de bo.C4.9Fa g.C3.BCre.C5.9Fi|boğa güreşi]]'' (literally "bull wrestling"). Each year in the third week of June, the Kafkasör (Caucasus) festival takes place in the city of [[Artvin]]. At the beginning of the festival, certain rules are applied in order to save the bulls from injury. For example, if a bull retreats from the fight, it means defeat, etc.&lt;ref name="Darke2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diana Darke|title=Eastern Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9WwsQE6AJ4C&amp;pg=PA334|accessdate=15 September 2013|year=2011|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-339-9|pages=334–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Tōgyū]]'', or "Okinawan bullfighting", is the traditional sport of the [[Ryukyu Islands]], in which two bulls attempt, as in [[sumo wrestling]], to push one another out of a ring.&lt;ref name="University1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Sered Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology Bar-Ilan University|title=Women of the Sacred Groves : Divine Priestesses of Okinawa: Divine Priestesses of Okinawa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0wIW7d8G1sC&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate=15 September 2013|date=12 February 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-535233-7|pages=119–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Bullfighting is also observed by the ethnic Hmong/Miao minority in China, Vietnam and Laos. Bulls are selected by age, horn length and size. They are enticed to fight usually after new year's or summer events. They are usually non-lethal events and bulls that carry the opposing bulls will get the most points if it is a draw. The loser is usually the bull that flees first even if winning.

==South Asia==
''Dhiri'' or ''Dhirio'' ([[Konkani language|Konkani]]: धिरी,धिरयो) is a popular form of traditional bull wrestling in the state of [[Goa]], [[Coastal South West India]]. It was the weekend entertainment staple for most villages. Many families lived off the earnings made on appearance money and bets alone.&lt;ref name=dhiri&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kamat Maad|first1=Govind|title=Dhirio: Bullish about a banned fight|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Dhirio-Bullish-about-a-banned-fight/articleshow/3625723.cms|accessdate=26 April 2015|agency=TNN|publisher=The times of India|date=Oct 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Panaji]] Bench of the high Court vide order dated 20.12.96 directed the State Government to take immediate steps to ban all types of animal fights including Dhiri organised in the State of Goa, which was finally banned in 1997.&lt;ref name=panaji&gt;{{cite book|last1=India.

==Criticism==
On 17 October 1987, during its 10th session, the [[Muslim World League|Islamic Council]] discussed the practices of bullfighting and animal pits (where two or more animals are agitated and forced to fight each other for the sole purpose of entertainment), and issued a [[fatwa]] that both are considered [[haraam]] (forbidden by Allah) due to their cruel nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.binbaz.org.sa/mat/134 حكم الملاكمة ومصارعة الثيران والمصارعة الحرة |&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving in [[World War II]] as a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] officer in the [[Pacific War]] where he was both injured and [[Military orders, awards and decorations|decorated]], he led the [[United World Federalists]] in the years after the war. In about 1949, he began work with the CIA where he became a high-level operative, retiring in 1977. He married [[Mary Pinchot Meyer|Mary Pinchot]] in 1945; the couple divorced in 1958, and she was subsequently romantically linked to President [[John F. Kennedy]]. Her 1964 murder remains both unsolved and controversial.

After his retirement from intelligence work, Meyer wrote as a columnist and book author.

==Early life==
Meyer was the son of a wealthy New York family.&lt;ref name=Burleigh&gt;{{cite book|last=Burleigh|first=Nina|title=A Very Private Woman: The Life and Unsolved Murder of Presidential Mistress Mary Meyer|year=1998|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=9780307574176|pages=83, 85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mQsAgT1pewC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|authorlink=Nina Burleigh|accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Cord Meyer Sr.]], was a diplomat and real estate developer; his mother, Katherine Blair Thaw, belonged to a Pennsylvania family that earned its wealth in the coal business.&lt;ref name=Burleigh/&gt; His grandfather, also called Cord Meyer, was a property developer and a chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]]. He was educated at [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]], New Hampshire, and attended [[Yale University]], where he was a member of the [[Scroll and Key]] society.&lt;ref name="Feb 7, 1978"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hendrickson|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Hendrickson|title=Behind the Scenes of a CIA Life|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/136968782.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Feb+7%2C+1978&amp;author=By+Paul+Hendrickson&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post++%281974-Current+file%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=B1&amp;desc=Behind+the+Scenes+of+Owe+CIA+Agent%27s+Life&lt;!-- pdf found here: http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/C%20Disk/CIA%20Meyer%20Cord/Item%2001.pdf --&gt;|accessdate=February 19, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 7, 1978|location=Washington, D.C.|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating in 1942, he joined the [[22nd Marine Regiment (United States)|22nd Marine Regiment]]&lt;ref name=Baratta&gt;{{cite book

He became a First Lieutenant and was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal]]. He shared his war experiences, writing for ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"&gt;{{cite news | title = Cord Meyer Jr. Dies at 80 | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2001-03-16|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/16/us/cord-meyer-jr-dies-at-80-communism-fighter-at-cia.html | first=Christopher | last=Marquis | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 19, 1945, in New York City, he married Mary Eno Pinchot, second daughter of [[Amos Pinchot]].

He was an aide of [[Harold Stassen]] to the 1945 San Francisco [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]], and in 1947, was elected president of the United World Federalists, the organization he helped to fund.

==CIA career==

''Circa'' 1949, Meyer started working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], joining the organization in 1951 at the invitation of [[Allen Dulles]]. At first he worked at the [[Office of Policy Coordination]] under former [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] man, [[Frank Wisner]].&lt;ref name="meyer"&gt;{{cite book

According to Deborah Davis in her 1979 book ''[[Katharine the Great]]'', Meyer became the "principal operative" of [[Operation Mockingbird]], a plan to secretly influence domestic and foreign media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah Davis|title=Katharine the Great|year=1979|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer befriended [[James Jesus Angleton|James Angleton]], who in 1954 became the CIA's [[counter-intelligence]] chief.

On 18 December 1956, Meyer's nine-year-old son, Michael, was hit by a car and killed. Meyer and his wife [[Mary Pinchot Meyer|Mary]] divorced in 1958.

===Later years===
He retired from the CIA in 1977. Following retirement, Meyer became a [[syndicated columnist]] and wrote several books, including an autobiography. Some insiders incorrectly suspected that Cord Meyer was [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]], a key informant in the [[Watergate Scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;Riebling, Mark, ''Wedge'' (2002) Touchstone {{ISBN|0-7432-4599-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of involvement in the assassination of John F. Kennedy==
After the death of former CIA agent and [[Watergate]] figure [[E.

{{quote| E. Howard scribbled the initials "LBJ," standing for Kennedy's ambitious vice president, Lyndon Johnson. Under "LBJ," connected by a line, he wrote the name Cord Meyer. Meyer was a CIA agent whose wife had an affair with JFK; later she was murdered, a case that's never been solved. Next his father connected to Meyer's name the name Bill Harvey, another CIA agent; also connected to Meyer's name was the name David Morales, yet another CIA man and a well-known, particularly vicious black-op specialist. And then his father connected to Morales' name, with a line, the framed words "French Gunman Grassy Knoll."}}

Many presume the "French gunman grassy knoll" was [[Lucien Sarti]], and [[William King Harvey|William Harvey]].&lt;ref name=Hedegaard/&gt;&lt;ref name=McAdams&gt;{{cite book|last=McAdams|first=John|title=JFK Assassination Logic: How to Think About Claims of Conspiracy|year=2011|publisher=Potomac Books|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9781597974899|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OJeNytAOZkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|authorlink=John C.

'''Craig Shergold''' (born 24 June 1979) is a British former [[cancer]] patient who received an estimated 350 million [[greeting card]]s, earning him a place in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''. Variations of the plea for greeting cards on his behalf in 1989 are still being distributed through the Internet, making the plea one of the most persistent [[urban legend]]s.

In 1988 Craig Shergold began complaining of [[Otalgia|ear aches]]. After [[antibiotics]] were unsuccessful in treating his symptoms, in 1989 doctors diagnosed him, at the age of nine, with what they considered [[terminal illness|terminal]] [[brain cancer]].&lt;ref name="Truth_or_Fiction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancer patient Craig Shergold Wants to Break The World Record for Receiving Greeting Cards.|url=http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/c/craigshergold.htm|publisher=www.truthorfiction.com|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greeting card campaign==

Craig's friends and relatives began a [[chain letter]] campaign requesting individuals to send greeting cards to him with the goal of beating the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for 1,000,065 greeting cards received.&lt;ref name="Emery_David"&gt;{{cite web|last=Emery|first=David|title=A User's Guide to Craig Shergold.|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/errata/a/craig_shergold.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara &amp; David P.|title=Craig Shergold.|url=http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/medical/shergold.asp|publisher=[[Snopes]]|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig received greeting cards from all over the world including celebrities like [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref name="Kingman_Daily_Miner"/&gt;

The Children's Wish Foundation became involved in the campaign in the early stages and quickly became overwhelmed by the volume of cards being received, though they later disavowed any connection with the chain letter campaigns.&lt;ref name="Emery_David"/&gt;

The campaign was successful and Shergold's name was added to the ''1991 [[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as having received 16,250,692 get-well cards by May 1990,&lt;ref name="Guinness_Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donald McFarlan &amp; Norris McWhirter|title=Guinness Book of World Records, 1991.|year=1991|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=0553289543|pages=487|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgoFN4QKARsC&amp;q=shergold#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in the ''1992 [[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as having received 33 million cards by May 1991.&lt;ref name="Guinness_Book_1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donald McFarlan &amp; Norris McWhirter|title=Guinness Book of World Records, 1992.|year=1992|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=0851123783|pages=216|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=25QhAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=shergold#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment successful ==

Craig's cancer worsened. His British doctors estimated he might only have a few weeks of life remaining and suggested the family bring him home for the last few weeks. [[Virginia]] billionaire [[John Kluge]], founder of [[Metromedia]], learned of Shergold's illness and arranged for him to travel to the [[United States]] for a new type of operation. He was operated on in 1991 at the [[University of Virginia|University of Virginia Medical Center]], where a physician was able to remove virtually all of the tumor except for a benign fragment.&lt;ref name="Kingman_Daily_Miner"&gt;{{cite news|title=Flood of postcards continuing after Craig Shergold cured of brain cancer.|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=932&amp;dat=19980706&amp;id=cqpPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RVMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5141,1126862|accessdate=14 June 2012|newspaper=[[Kingman Daily Miner]]|date=6 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig grew into a healthy adult. 

== Chain letter popularity ==

Even after his recovery, the chain letter continued to circulate and millions of greeting cards continued to flow to Shergold's home. Craig estimated that by 1998, he had received a total of 250 million cards. Variants of the chain mail changed Craig's name to "Craig Shelford", "Craig Stafford", "Craig Shefford", or even "Greg Sherwood". Another variant involves requests for [[business cards]].&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;

The [[Royal Mail]] gave their home its own [[postal code]] because of the volume of mail they received. To avoid the deluge of mail, the family halted mail delivery and later moved.

== Legacy ==

Since 1989, Craig has received approximately 350 million greeting cards. As an adult, Craig does not make any public appearances other than to express his new wish&amp;ndash;for the mail to stop.&lt;ref name="Williams_Robert_M"&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Robert M.|title=Most of us just want to be kind.|url=http://www.thealmatimes.com/articles/2007/11/26/opinion/01rmw.txt|accessdate=14 June 2012|newspaper=The Alma Times|date=21 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2013}}, he continues to receive cards, sent to his old address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tahir|first=Tariq|title=Well-wishers send 350m get well cards to former cancer patient|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/02/07/well-wishers-send-350m-get-well-cards-to-former-cancer-patient-3398394/|accessdate=7 February 2013|newspaper=(UK) Metro|date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]] also states on their Web site that they do not engage in chain letters or telemarketing activities and also denies any involvement in fulfilling Craig's original wish, stating that it was done by another wish-granting organization. Any mail that is received is forwarded to a recycling center.&lt;ref name="fraud_alerts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fraud Alerts.|url=http://www.wish.org/about/fraud_alerts|publisher=[[Make-A-Wish Foundation]]|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular media ==

In 1993, Shergold's mother, Marion, wrote a book about her son's story entitled, ''Craig Shergold : A Mother's Story''.&lt;ref name="Shergold_Marion"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Marion Shergold &amp; Pamela Cockerill|title=Craig Shergold: A Mother's Story.|year=1993|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=0553406299|pages=364|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2b7mAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Craig+Shergold+:+A+Mother's+Story&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0jfZT722I5Ck8gTprZTEAw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 November 2001, [[Ion Television|PAX TV]] aired a [[television movie|made-for-TV movie]], ''[[The Miracle of the Cards]]''. The movie starred [[Thomas Sangster]] as Shergold and also featured [[Kirk Cameron]] as a cynical reporter.&lt;ref name="Miracle_of_the_Cards"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Miracle of the Cards.|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0292109/|publisher=[[IMDB]]|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World record retired ==

Guinness World Records has retired the record and requested that individuals no longer respond to any requests for greeting cards.&lt;ref name="Guinness_FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions.|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/faq/|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters''' ('''DTM''', German Touring Car Masters) is a [[touring car]] series sanctioned by [[DMSB]] and [[Internationale Tourenwagen Rennen|ITR]] who has been an affiliation of [[FIA]] since 1976 and 2003 respectively. Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars use a [[silhouette racing car]] based on a mass-produced road car, and is based in Germany, but also with rounds elsewhere in Europe.

From 2000 onwards, this ''new DTM'' continued the former [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]] (German Touring Car Championship) and ITC (International Touring Car Championship) which had been discontinued after 1996 due to high costs.

==History==
===The new DTM 2000===
[[File:DTM car mercedes2006.jpg|thumb|Mercedes-Benz AMG DTM car (2006)]]
During the ITC era a large proportion of the revenue generated by the championship went to the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]], with the result that less went to the teams who subsequently complained of little return on their increasingly large investment in the high-tech series. Since 1997 many ideas have been discussed in order to find a compromise for rules of a new DTM. [[Opel]] put the primary emphasis on cost control, [[Mercedes-Benz]] supported expensive competitiveness in development, [[BMW]] wanted an international series rather than one focused on Germany only, while Audi insisted on allowing their trademark [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] [[four-wheel drive]] (despite running the [[rear wheel drive]] [[Audi R8 (race car)|Audi R8]]) in [[sports car racing]].

The DTM returned in 2000 as Mercedes and Opel had agreed to use cars that were based on the concept car that was shown by Opel on various occasions, e.g. the 1999 [[24 Hours Nürburgring]] where Opel celebrated its 100th anniversary. The series adopted the format of the 1995 championship, with most rounds held in Germany with occasional rounds throughout Europe, but having learnt the lessons of the ITC disaster, the ITR constantly strived to keep costs in the series from exploding to unreasonable levels, and to keep the championship firmly tied to its German roots. As too many races were planned outside Germany, no Championship (Meisterschaft) status was granted by the [[Deutscher Motor Sport Bund|DMSB]], and the DTM initials now stand for '''[https://web.archive.org/web/20080314104059/http://www.racecar-engineering.com/articles/touringcar/172003/dtm-at-close-quarters.html Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]''' (German Touring Car Masters).

Unlike the previous incarnation which primarily used sedan models like the [[Mercedes-Benz W201]], the new DTM featured only 2-door [[coupé]]s. Opel used the upcoming Coupé version of the [[Opel Astra|Astra]] as in the concept car, and Mercedes the [[Mercedes CLK (C208)|CLK]] model which already was used as a pattern for the [[Mercedes-Benz CLK-GTR]].

The motorsport arm of the Bavarian tuning company [[Abt Sportsline]] was allowed to enter on short notice. Abt used the [[Audi TT]] as a basis, as Audi had no suitable 2-door coupé, even though the dimensions of this car did not fit into the rules. The 1999 STW-[[Supertouring]]-champion [[Christian Abt]] could not defend his STW title as this series was also discontinued, with Opel moving into DTM.

===DTM 2000–2003===
In May 2000, the new DTM started with the traditional [[Hockenheimring]] short track version. Some cars still had no or few sponsorship decals. While Opel could match the speed of most Mercedes in the 2000 season, the hastily developed Abt-Audis were mainly outclassed. As the TT shape had rather poor aerodynamic properties, Abt was allowed to use a stretched form later. Further benefits like a higher rear wing helped the Abt-Audi TT-R win the DTM championship in 2002 with [[Laurent Aïello]].

===Ups and downs for Opel===
[[File:Manuel Reuter DTM(ThKraft).jpg|thumb|Opel Astra DTM]]
In 2000, [[Manuel Reuter]] came second in the championship. After that year, no Opel driver was among the top three, with few podium finishes and no victory for the disappointing "lightnings". On the other hand, it was Opel team boss Volker Strycek who brought a new highlight to the fans, by racing a modified DTM car on the traditional old version of the [[Nürburgring]] in 2002, 20 years after the top classes had moved to the modern Grand Prix track, and 10 years after the old DTM stopped racing there. The Opels did not win in most of their entries in the [[VLN]] endurance races as they were mainly testing, but the speed was impressive, and the fans loved it. They won however the 2003 Nürburgring 24 Hours against factory efforts by Audi (Who also ran a DTM-spec TT) and BMW (Who ran an ALMS-spec M3).

===Audi joins DTM in 2004===
After their successes with the [[Audi R8 Race Car|Audi R8]] and the official support of the Abt-TTRs at the Nürburgring, Audi finally joined the DTM as a factory entry in 2004. The three constructors involved decided to switch to [[sedan (car)|saloon]] bodies. The road models used as patterns since 2004 are the [[Audi A4]], [[Opel Vectra]] GTS and the [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class]]. All dimensions, like wheelbase, are identical in order to provide equal opportunities without the actual design of the road cars having any influence. Audi immediately had stellar success in 2004 with Swedish driver [[Mattias Ekström]], now a long-time veteran of the sport, becoming champion for the first time.

===DTM in 2005–2006===
The championship suffered a setback in 2004 when long-time also-ran [[Opel]] decided to pull out of the series at the end of the 2005 season, as part of a large cost-cutting operation in [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]' European division. Initially the gap looked set to be filled by [[MG Rover]], however their plans to enter the series were cancelled after the company collapsed in April 2005. Audi and Mercedes fielded 10 cars each in 2006, but the important television deal with the major television station [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] required three marques in 2007. 

===DTM in 2007–2013===
The DTM carried on with only two manufacturers. The years 2007-2009 were marked by the dominance of Audi. Swede Mattias Ekström won the second of his two titles in 2007, and [[Timo Scheider]] took the driver's championship in the following two years. Mercedes were in the runner-up positions in both 2008 and 2009 ([[Paul di Resta]] in 2008 and Gary Paffett in 2009). In 2010, Mercedes finally bridged the gap to Audi, as Paul di Resta won the 2010 championship driving for AMG Mercedes.

In 2011 and 2012, the DTM held a [[Race of Champions]]-style exhibition event in the [[Munich Olympic Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport1.de/de/motorsport/mot_dtm/newspage_511971.html |title=DTM-Präsentation in Wiesbaden &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Ergebnisse &amp;#124; Live &amp;#124; Bundesliga &amp;#124; SPORT1 &amp;#124; Video &amp;#124; Motorsport |publisher=Sport1.de |date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2012 was the year that [[BMW]] made a return to the series after twenty years away,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportschau.de/sp/dtm/news201010/15/rueckkehr_bmw.jsp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018033249/http://www.sportschau.de/sp/dtm/news201010/15/rueckkehr_bmw.jsp |date=18 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the drivers', teams', and manufacturers' titles in their first year after a 20-year hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtm.com/en/Races/Standings.html |title=Driver Championship, Team championship, Manufacturer championship |publisher=DTM |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026053532/http://www.dtm.com/en/Races/Standings.html |archivedate=26 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Audi]] has switched from the A4 to the [[Audi A5|A5]] in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/german-racers-new-bmw-m3-audi-a5-dtm-cars-previewed-for-2012-season-97859.html |title=German Racers: New BMW M3, Audi A5 DTM Cars Previewed for 2012 Season – Motor Trend WOT |publisher=Wot.motortrend.com |date=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the RS5 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/news/audi-rs5-dtm-racecar-revealed-at-geneva-55976.html |title=Audi RS5 DTM Racecar Revealed at Geneva |publisher=Autoevolution.com |date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the F1-style Drag Reduction Systems were introduced by DTM for the first time to improve racing.
===Recent history (2014–present)===
In 2014, the body shape as well as aero kits of all DTM cars were remodified to improve racing. The double-header races (Saturday and Sunday races) were returned in 2015 and thus switching from lap-race to timed race. The qualifying format were also reformatted into single-session timed qualification for Saturday and Sunday races. Performance weights were also introduced to determine the winning cars's weight.

In 2017 the DTM field size was scaled down from 24 to 18 cars to improve quality as well as making it more affordable for its existing manufacturers and a more attractive proposition for any prospective entrants.

==International expansion==
===DTM—SuperGT unification===
In March 2010, GT Association (the governing body in [[Super GT]] series in Japan) reported the ITR are starting to unite the mechanical regulation with Japan's GT500 (Super GT's upper class), and [[NASCAR]]'s [[Grand American Road Racing Association]] Grand Touring division to form a new Grand Touring specification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touringcartimes.com/article.php?id=7091 Super GT moves closer to DTM regulations]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Touring Car Times''. 15 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012 a cooperation deal between DTM and Super GT was signed in Tokyo. The agreement regarding the use of the 'New DTM' regulations by Japan's Super GT begins in 2014 and runs&amp;nbsp;– for the time being&amp;nbsp;– for four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtm.com/en/News/Joint-future-for-DTM-and-Japanese-Super-GT-from-2014.html/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018190047/http://www.dtm.com/en/News/Joint-future-for-DTM-and-Japanese-Super-GT-from-2014.html/ |date=18 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DTM is set to ditch V8 engines in favour of two-litre turbos by 2019 at the latest, which Super GT had implemented in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/107154|title=DTM set to switch to turbo engines by 2016|author=Gary Watkins|date=3 May 2013|accessdate=19 June 2013|work=Autosport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NASCAR Holdings / United SportsCar Racing===
On 27 March 2013, the ITR and NASCAR Holdings' road racing division, [[United SportsCar Racing]], announced after years of planning, a North American DTM is scheduled to start between 2015 and 2016 based on the 2014 DTM regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/03/26/imsa-grand-am-dtm-agreement.html IMSA, Grand-Am, DTM Agreement] NASCAR Holdings press release.  27 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; But North American DTM are not yet commenced currently.

==Race format==
When the series returned, it used a similar format to 1996: two races of 100 kilometres, with a short break between them. In 2001 and 2002 there was a short race of 35 kilometres as well as a long race of 100 kilometres, which included one pit stop and gave points for the top 10 as in earlier seasons. From 2003 to 2014 there was only one race, which had a distance of about 170 kilometres, and two mandatory pit stops.

For the 2015 season a new race format was introduced. Race weekend consisted of 40-minute (Saturday) and 60-minute (Sunday) races. On Saturday's race a pit stop was optional, while on Sunday's race a pit stop was mandatory and all the four tyres had to be changed. Both races had the same scoring system.

From the 2017 season, both races of a weekend will feature the same distance – 55 minutes plus a complete lap, with one of them being held on Saturday, the other on Sunday. In both races, the drivers have to pit at least once for a set of fresh tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dtm.com/en/regulations/sporting-regulations|title=Sporting regulations|date=2015-04-25|work=DTM.com {{!}} The official website|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DTM drivers==
[[File:DTM car mercedes2006 Haekkinen racing.jpg|thumb|[[Mika Häkkinen]] in his Mercedes, 2006]]
The drivers have been a mixture of young and older drivers, including well known former [[Formula One]] drivers [[David Coulthard]], [[Bernd Schneider (racecar driver)|Bernd Schneider]], [[Allan McNish]], [[Jean Alesi]], [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]], [[Ralf Schumacher]], [[JJ Lehto]], [[Pedro Lamy]], [[Karl Wendlinger]], [[Emanuele Pirro]], [[Stefano Modena]] and two-time F1 world champion [[Mika Häkkinen]]. Others, such as [[Laurent Aïello]], [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]], [[Dindo Capello]], [[Frank Biela]], [[Marco Werner]], [[Lucas Luhr]], [[Alexandre Prémat]], [[Yves Olivier]], [[Jaroslav Janiš]], and [[Alain Menu]] have made their career racing in [[sports cars]] and touring cars.

Increasingly, the DTM is being used by young guns such as [[Robert Wickens]] and [[Gary Paffett]] to jump-start their racing career in single-seaters. Wickens was in the 2012 Mercedes young driver program and in his first year of DTM. This strategy appears to have worked well for [[Christijan Albers]], who built a reputation by finishing second and third in the [[2003 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|2003]] and [[2004 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|2004]] championships with [[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport|Mercedes-Benz]] and then graduated to [[Formula One]] in [[2005 Formula One season|2005]]. He came back in 2008, but this time driving for [[Audi]]. After winning the championship in 2010, Paul di Resta raced from 2011 until 2013 for Mercedes-engined Formula One team [[Force India]]. He has now returned to the Mercedes DTM team. [[Pascal Wehrlein]], who has won the championship in a Mercedes car in 2015 went on to race for Sauber F1 Team and is a testing driver for the Mercedes works team.

Gary Paffett has also used his championship win to gain a test with [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]], and they signed him as permanent test driver for 2006. This prevented Paffett from defending his title in 2006, however he thought that it will be a springboard for a race seat during the [[2007 Formula One season]]. The plan failed however, and Paffett returned to DTM in 2007, but in a 2006 specification car.

Four female drivers have taken part in the championship. In 2006 [[Vanina Ickx]] started racing for Audi and [[Susie Wolff]] for Mercedes. In 2008 Ickx was replaced by [[Katherine Legge]], who was subsequently replaced for the 2011 season by [[Rahel Frey]].

==Cars and specifications==
===Chassis===
[[File:DTM Chassi.jpg|thumb|right|The cutaway DTM car.]]
The DTM is a mass-produced touring car. The championship controls and specifies the chassis/car and engine manufacturers that teams are allowed to use each season. The league's choice of manufacturers are changed every three years. Currently Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz provides the cars to all teams, with Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz providing the engines respectively. Opel has provided cars and engines in 2000-2005 but left at the end of the 2005 season. The all Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars closely resemble public road vehicles but heavily modified into a race version.

During the first inaugural resumption season, all DTM car styles were utilized shorter two-door coupé-style cars until 2003 season but in 2004 coupé-style cars were minority due to the transition to four-door sedan saloon-style cars. In 2004 the four-door sedan saloon-style cars were introduced due to touring car's philosophy (several touring car racing tournaments have a ''de facto'' 4-door sedan saloon cars) until 2011. For 2012 season onwards the two-door coupé-style cars were returned until to date but the two-door coupé-style cars are much more different than 2000-2003 cars (longer length, longer wheelbase, slightly lower height and aggressive aero package). The updated new coupé-style cars were introduced in 2017 thanks to new rear wing.

The cars are supposed to be fast and spectacular, while still fairly cheap to build and run. All DTM race cars have RWD and 4.0 L V8 engines which are air-restricted to 460 hp but now into over 500 hp since 2017 season, no matter if similar layouts or engines are available in the road cars. Instead of the road car bodies, unrelated purpose-built [[chassis]] are used, which are closer to prototype racing. Many drivers have in fact described the handling of the cars as closer to single seater racing cars than road cars. Only the roof sections of the road cars are put on top of the roll cages, and lights and other distinctive design features are used in order to provide a resemblance to the road cars. Also, in order to save money and provide close racing, many common parts from third party specialists are used, like transmission (from [[Hewland]]), brakes (from [[AP Racing]]), wheels (from [[ATS (wheels)|ATS]]) and [[Hankook]] tyres ([[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters#Tyres|see below]]). The all-important aerodynamic configurations are tested in [[wind tunnel]]s before the season, brought to an equal level, and kept that way throughout the season.

DTM cars adhere to a [[front engine]] [[rear-wheel-drive]] design (similar to public legal road car). A [[roll cage]] serves as a [[space frame]] [[chassis]], covered by CFRP crash elements on the side, front and rear and covered by metallic bodywork. They have a closed cockpit, a bi-plane rear wing, and other aerodynamic parts such as front splitter, side winglets and hood holes (see also on [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters#Aerodynamics|Aerodynamics]] section for more details).

The price of 1 unit current DTM car is normally €600,000-1,000,000 complete.
====Aerodynamics====
All Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars aero packages are completely assembled. The car floor underbody is flat. Serratured side front fenders are included along with triple-decker front side winglet flicks, multiple side winglet flicks and multiple rear winglet flicks. The current rear wing of all Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars are slightly wider, bi-plane wing and also parallelogram rear wing end plate. DTM cars have included a [[Drag Reduction System]] since the [[2013 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|2013 season]] (similar to [[Formula One]]) for helping the driver to overtake the other opponents.

====Transmission, gearbox and clutches====
For the transmission gearboxes, all DTM cars currently use a [[semi-automatic transmission]] with 6-speed gearbox operated by paddle shifters and supplied by [[Hewland|Hewland Engineering]] since the 2012 season. From 2000 to 2011, all DTM cars used [[sequential manual transmission]] with a 6-speed gearbox operated by the gear lever. The clutch of all DTM cars are CFRP 4-plate clutch operated by foot-pedal and provided by [[ZF Friedrichshafen AG|ZF]]. Mechanical limited-slip differential are also allowed and constant velocity joint tripod driveshafts are also used. All Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars drivetrain are currently [[front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|front-engine with rear-wheel-drive layout]].

====Other components====
All DTM cars carry a Bosch-provided [[electronic control unit]] (Motronic MS 5.1 model). Live [[Telemetry#Motor racing|telemetry]] is used only for television broadcasts, but the data can be recorded from the ECU to the computer if the car is in the garage and not on the track.

Rear view mirrors for all DTM cars are fully mandated to easily viewing opponents behind.

===Engines===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Audi DTM engine.jpg|thumb|right|A typical current DTM engine.]] --&gt;
=====First generation=====
The cars were powered by [[naturally-aspirated]] (no turbocharger and supercharger) [[indirect injection|indirect-injected]] stock block V8 engines, with aluminium alloy [[Engine block|blocks]], 2x[[Overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[valvetrain]] actuating four-valves per cylinder and limited to {{convert|4.0|L|cuin|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} [[Engine displacement|displacement]] since the series' rebirth in 2000. DTM car engines are currently producing over {{convert|500|hp|kW PS|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} power output at 8,500 rpm. [[Audi Sport|Audi]], [[BMW Motorsport|BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport|Mercedes-Benz]] are currently providing DTM engines with the manufacturers respectively. The engines of all DTM cars are close-resemblance to public vehicle road cars but heavily modified to DTM race version.

DTM engines were rev-limited to 9,000 rpm. The valve train is a dual overhead camshaft configuration with four valves per cylinder. The crankshaft is made of alloy steel, with five main bearing caps. The pistons were forged aluminum alloy, while the connecting rods are machined alloy steel. The firing ignition was a CDI ignition system. The engine lubrication was a dry sump type, cooled by a single water pump.

The first generation DTM engine weight are DTM-mandated minimum {{convert|148|kg|lb|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} without filter and spark box.

The first generation {{Convert|4.0|L|cuin|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} V8 engine normally aspirated 90-degree configuration were used as a required engine configuration until 2018 season.

=====Second generation=====
All Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars will switch from outgoing {{Convert|4.0|L|cuin|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] [[naturally-aspirated]] [[fuel injection|indirect electronic injection]] to an all-new {{Convert|2.0|L|cuin|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} [[inline-4 engine|inline-4]] cylinder [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Gasoline direct injection|direct injection]] engine from the 2019 season onwards called the "Class One" while the current coupé-style cars will remain from 2019 beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adam|first=Mitchell|title=DTM delays new engines and Class One rules to 2019|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/122541|website=[[Autosport.com]]|publisher=[[Autosport]]|accessdate=January 20, 2016|date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will mark the return of turbocharger engines in [[2019 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|2019 season]] for the first time since [[1990 Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft|1990]]. The power output of all-new DTM engine will be increased from {{Convert|500|to|600|hp|kW PS|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. [[Aston Martin Racing|Aston Martin]], [[Audi Sport GmbH|Audi]] and [[BMW Motorsport|BMW]] will providing DTM new engines with the manufacturers respectively. The engine components are aluminium alloy [[Engine block|blocks]], [[Overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[valvetrain]] actuating four-valves per cylinder and limited to {{convert|2.0|L|cuin|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} [[Engine displacement|displacement]].

====Spark plugs====
All Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars carried a spark plugs are made of iridium and supplied exclusively by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] since 2000.

====Exhaust systems====
The exhaust systems of all DTM cars are silencer type but made of titanium with operation of three-way catalytic converter. Currently [[Akrapovič]] ([[Audi]] and [[BMW]]) and Remus ([[Mercedes-AMG]]) are providing the exhaust systems.

====Fuel====
At its inception, all the DTM cars currently use ordinary unleaded racing fuel, which has been the de facto standard in German touring car racing since original DTM 1994 and the reborn of DTM in 2000 (previously the original DTM were used leaded fuels in 1984-1993). Since the 2010 season, the fuel of all DTM cars is currently [[Aral AG|Aral Ultimate]] 102 RON unleaded racing fuel. In 2005-2010, the Aral Ultimate 100 RON unleaded fuel was used for all DTM cars. From 2000 to 2003, [[Agip]] was providing an unleaded fuel for all DTM cars. From 2004, all DTM cars were fueled by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] until mid-2005, when they switched to [[Aral AG|Aral Ultimate]] 100 RON unleaded racing fuel.

Current Aral Ultimate 102 RON unleaded gasoline is resemble the ordinary unleaded public vehicles gasoline which has better mileage, environmental-friendly and safer than other fuels.

====Lubricants====
The lubricant supplier of all DTM cars are mandatory recommendation by per manufacturer ([[Audi]] with [[Castrol]], [[BMW]] with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[Mercedes-AMG]] with [[Petronas]]).

====Cooling components====
The car also features internal cooling upgrades, a new water radiator, radiator duct, oil/water heat exchanger, modified oil degasser, new oil and water pipes and new heat exchanger fixing brackets. PWR is the current DTM cooling component supplier since 2000.

===Performance===
According to research and pre-season stability tests, the current model can go 0 to 100 km/h in approximately 2.6 seconds. The car has a top speed of {{Convert|270|km/h|mph|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} meaning that it is the second fastest touring car behind the Australian V8 Supercars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=V8 Supercars Technical Specifications|url=https://www.v8scglobal.com/inside-supercars/v8-supercar-technical-specifications|website=v8scglobal.com|publisher=v8scglobal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Balance of Performance====
In 2015, Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters were introduced the Balance of Performance (BoP) weight to improve racing spectacle. The Balance of Performance (BoP) weight regulations were the car weight allowance range must be {{Convert|2436|-|2513|lb|kg|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} in 2015-2016 later changed to {{Convert|2414|-|2513|lb|kg|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} from the mid-2017 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dtm.com/en/news/new-performance-weight-regulations-2016-07-26.html|title=The New Performance-Weight Regulations|work=DTM.com|publisher=DTM.com|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dtm.com/en/news/fine-tuning-allocation-performance-weight-revised-2017-06-15.html|title=Fine-tuning: Allocation of Performance Weight Revised|work=DTM.com|publisher=DTM.com|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Balance of Performance (BoP) weight regulations were scrapped just before the Austrian race due to several protests and criticisms from DTM teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hewitt|first=Chloe|url=https://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/2017/09/dtm-scraps-performance-weights-immediate-effect/|title=DTM Scraps Performance Weights With Immediate Effect|work=thecheckeredflag.co.uk|publisher=thecheckeredflag.co.uk|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prohibitions===
Driver aids like [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[traction control]], [[Launch control (automotive)|launch control]], [[active suspension]], cockpit-adjustable anti-roll bar and partial car-to-team radio communications are currently prohibited except fuel mapping and Drag Reduction Systems, which can only be used for 12 laps in 2018 when near enough.

===Driver safety===
The safety is very important for all Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters drivers. Race suit, Nomex underwear, gloves, socks, boots and headsocks are requiredly by driver. Meanwhile the helmets for all Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters drivers are made of carbon-fibre shell, lined with energy-absorbing foam and Nomex padding. The helmet type must meet or exceed [[FIA]] 8860-2010 certification approval as a homologation for all auto racing drivers.

===Comparison with Formula One===
A Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters car is a single-seat touring car racing. For much of their history Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars have more different to Formula One cars, although there have traditionally been several key differences between the two.

Over the years both Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters and [[Formula One]] race schedules are traditionally held in permanent racing courses. The increased stress and speed of these tracks mean that the cars tended to be heavier, wider and have shorter wheelbases than F1 cars (increasing stability but decreasing agility).

When the weight of the driver is factored in, a Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters car weighed over 55% more than a Formula One Car. The minimum weight for a Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters car was adjusted from {{Convert|1080|kg|lb|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} based on the weight of the driver compared to the field average; with the driver included, all cars had a minimum weight of {{Convert|1120|kg|lb|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} (with a Balance of Performance weight allowance range of {{Convert|1095|-|1140|kg|lb|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. A Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters car piloted by 82 kg [[Maxime Martin]] (the heaviest driver in the series and 10 kg heavier than the field average) had to have weighed at least 1,080 kg when empty. The minimum weight of a Formula One Car, including the driver, currently {{Convert|722|kg|lb|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. This difference of {{Convert|398|kg|lb|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} is just over 55% of the 2017 F1 car's weight.

Beginning in the [[2000 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|inaugural season of the reborn DTM]] that Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars used the {{Convert|4.0|L|cuin|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} [[naturally-aspirated engine|naturally-aspirated]] 90-degree [[V8 engine]]s but that time in 2000 [[Formula One]] were used the {{Convert|3.0|L|cuin|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} [[naturally-aspirated engine|naturally-aspirated]] various bank angle [[V10 engine]]s until end of 2005. Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars had up to {{Convert|460|hp|kW|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} more compared to their Formula One counterparts, as early as in the 70s the cars had in excess of 1,000 hp. Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars having {{Convert|460|hp|kW|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} on demand and F1 cars having around 700 hp to 840 hp in 3.5L NA (1989–94) era, around 700 hp to 1000 hp for final specs in 3.0L NA V10 (1995–2005) era and around 770 hp to 840 hp in 2.4L NA V8 (2006–2013) era and currently over 800hp (2017 spec combustion engine alone) with an additional 160hp from the electric motors from their 1.6L V6 turbo-hybrid-electro powerunit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.motorsport-total.com/f1/news/2014/03/wie-viel-ps-hat-der-neue-turbomotor-lauda-outet-mercedes-14030502.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.formel1.de/saison/reglement/technisches-reglement&lt;/ref&gt; The turbo used mainly to improve the spectacle rather than lap-times with the so-called 'power-to-pass' or 'push-to-pass' system giving drivers an increased amount of power for a limited duration during the race. Another reason for retaining the turbocharger especially in Formula-1 is the muffling effect it has on the exhaust note, which helps keep the cars inside noise-limits, to meet FIA regulations and rules at the many city street races in European cities on the racing season schedule.

Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars used unleaded gasoline for fuel rather than leaded gasoline, and refuelling had always been banned during the race since 2012 season. This is a legacy of an incident at the second Hockenheimring race in 2008 that involving [[Marcus Winkelhock]] due to fuel spill after over refuelling. Until 1994, when refuelling was re-introduced to F1 (and banned again from 2010 onwards), the coupling for the refuelling hose was a notable difference between Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars (canister refueler) and Formula cars (hose refueler). Refuelling were allowed in DTM from 2000 to 2011 seasons.

Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars has flat undersides to improve stability. F1 banned sculpted undersides in a bid to lower cornering speeds for 1983. In an effort to create better passing opportunities, the new spec Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars being introduced in 2012 will generate nearly 50% of the total downforce of the car with flat underside tunnels versus the front splitter and rear wing. This will reduce turbulent air behind the cars, enabling easier overtaking.

Unlike in F1, Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters teams were obliged to [[Formula One#Drivers and constructors|construct their own chassis]] for only main teams, and had tended to buy cars constructed by independent suppliers such as [[Audi]], [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-AMG]]. However Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters had essentially been a semi-spec series since 2005, with all teams favoring both [[Audi]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] cars mainly because of [[Opel]]'s withdrawal after 2005 season.

The Formula One Car is a more expensive and technology-centric platform than a DTM car. This was even the case during the new coupé era since 2012 season. At this time global automotive manufacturers [[Audi]], [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-AMG]] vied for dominance. Since Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters's restructuring, a desire to keep costs down and the existence of two car manufacturer helped create a series with far more parity than [[Formula One]] in 2006.

For top speeds, Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters cars are slower than [[Formula One]] car in fact (DTM cars have {{Convert|168|mph|km/h|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} in a normal tracks meanwhile [[Formula One car]]s have {{Convert|225|mph|km/h|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} in a high-speed tracks such as [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]]).

In the case of a tie, DTM will determine the champion based on the most first-place finishes. If there is still a tie, DTM will determine the champion by the most second-place finishes, then the most third-place finishes, etc., until a champion is determined. DTM will apply the same system to other ties in the rankings at the close of the season and at any other time during the season.

'''Earth Escape Explorer''' ('''CU-E&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''') is a [[nanosatellite]] of the 6-Unit [[CubeSat]] format that will demonstrate long-distance communications while in [[heliocentric orbit]].&lt;ref name='Home CUE3'&gt; [https://www.colorado.edu/cubequest/ CU Earth Escape Explorer]. University of Colorado Boulder. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Earth Escape Explorer'' spacecraft is a student-driven effort at [[University of Colorado Boulder]] to design and build the spacecraft as part of the NASA CubeQuest Challenge. It will be one of thirteen CubeSats to be carried with the [[Exploration Mission 1|Orion EM-1 mission]] into a [[heliocentric orbit]] in [[cislunar space]] on the maiden flight of the [[Space Launch System]], scheduled to launch in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/three-diy-cubesats-score-rides-on-nasa-s-first-flight-of-orion-space-launch-system |title=Three DIY CubeSats Score Rides on NASA's First Flight of Orion, Space Launch System |publisher=NASA |first1=Gina |last1=Anderson |first2=Molly |last2=Porter |date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==

The CU-E&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; team is pursuing four different CubeQuest prizes: Largest aggregate data volume; most error-free data blocks; the most distant communications from Earth; and spacecraft longevity.&lt;ref name='CSN 2017'&gt;[https://www.coloradospacenews.com/cube-quest-challenge-team-spotlight-cu-e3/ Cube Quest Challenge Team Spotlight: CU-E3].

Once deployed in the vicinity of the Moon, CU-E&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; will use a lunar [[gravity assist]] to propel itself into [[heliocentric orbit]], trailing the Earth and slowly distancing itself over time.&lt;ref name='Home CUE3'/&gt; By the end of its one-year mission, CU-E&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is planned to be as far as 27 million kilometers from Earth.&lt;ref name='Home CUE3'/&gt; The spacecraft will use a commercial 6U CubeSat satellite body ([[Satellite bus|bus]]) called XB1, measuring about 10×20×30 cm. The mass is about {{convert|14|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/cu-e3.htm CU-E3]. Gunter Dirk Krebs, ''Gunter's Space Page. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Electric power will be provided by [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] and stored in rechargeable [[Lithium battery|lithium batteries]].

;Communications
The mission is focused upon advancing [[Outer space|deep space]] CubeSat communication techniques using an innovative [[reflective array antenna]], an [[X band]] transmitter for downlink and a [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] transmitter for uplink.&lt;ref name='transponder'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Home CUE3'/&gt;&lt;ref name='CSN 2017'/&gt; The antenna array is "planar", meaning all of the elements are in one plane, yet provide a large aperture for [[beam steering]] and make possible high data rates.&lt;ref name='CSN 2017'/&gt; ATLAS Ground Networks will be the ground station for their uplink and downlink communications.&lt;ref name='CSN 2017'/&gt;  Their telecomm package is called High-Rate CubeSat Communication System (HRCCS).&lt;ref name='transponder'/&gt;

;Propulsion
CU-E&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; does not feature an on board propulsion system, and will be using [[solar radiation pressure]] for [[reaction wheel]] desaturation and [[attitude control]] (orientation).&lt;ref name='CSN 2017'/&gt;

'''Elmer Edward Solly''' (September 5, 1945 &amp;ndash; November 30, 2007) was convicted of [[manslaughter]] in 1970 for the death of two-year-old Christopher Welsh.  Solly escaped from custody in 1974 and spent the next 27 years living under numerous [[pseudonym]]s.  At the time of his arrest in May 2001, he was living in [[Florida]] as Daniel "Danny C" Catalano, a supposed former member of the [[United States|American]] [[rock 'n' roll]] group [[Sha Na Na]]; in fact, he never had any ties to Sha Na Na.&lt;ref name="tisch"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Tisch |author2=Graham Brink |title=27 years on lam, felon's gig is up |url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/051201/TampaBay/27_years_on_lam__felo.shtml |publisher=''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' |date=2001-05-21 |accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moran"&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Moran |title=Sha Na Na impostor lived a lie for years |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20010524/ai_n10690510 |publisher=''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' |date=2001-05-24 |accessdate=2007-08-11 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manslaughter conviction and escape==
On the evening of July 25, 1969, Solly, in a drunken rage, severely beat his girlfriend's two-year-old son, Christopher Welsh, who died of his injuries.  Solly turned himself in to local police a few days later.  He was convicted of manslaughter on April 16, 1970, and incarcerated at [[New Jersey State Prison|Trenton State Prison]].  While Solly was in Trenton State Prison, his mother and grandmother began a letter-writing campaign alleging mistreatment on the part of prison guards.&lt;ref name="njdoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdcbank.state.nj.us/corrections/NJDOC_newsletter/Issue2No2_SpringFall_2001/html/newsltr_ManOnTheRun.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070810225515/http://www.pdcbank.state.nj.us/corrections/NJDOC_newsletter/Issue2No2_SpringFall_2001/html/newsltr_ManOnTheRun.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-10 |title=After 27 years, escaped murderer apprehended, returned to New Jersey |accessdate=2007-08-11}} &lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the campaign, Solly was transferred to medium-security [[Leesburg State Prison]] in 1974.  There, he befriended a prison [[psychologist]], who convinced officials to allow Solly to visit his mother.  During the third visit, in June 1974, Solly was accompanied only by the psychologist.  Solly asked to be allowed to visit his girlfriend, and he used the opportunity to escape.&lt;ref name="tisch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/08/48hours/main628273.shtml |title=The Great Pretender: Fugitive Steals Identity Of Doo-Wop Group's Lead Singer |accessdate=2007-08-11 | work=CBS News | date=July 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His escape was not reported to police for six hours, giving Solly sufficient time to disappear.&lt;ref name="courttv"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Head Cases |url=http://www.courttv.com/onair/shows/the_investigators/g_p_episodes/head_cases.html |series=The Investigators |network=[[Court TV]] |airdate=2007-08-11 |minutes= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205071245/http://www.courttv.com/onair/shows/the_investigators/g_p_episodes/head_cases.html |archivedate=2006-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a fugitive==
Immediately after his escape, Solly began using a series of assumed identities to evade capture.  In 1975, he was arrested in [[Philadelphia]] for receiving stolen goods, but because he used a fake name, police did not realize who he was.  Similarly, he provided a fake name when he was stopped for a traffic violation in 1979 and avoided detainment.&lt;ref name="moran" /&gt;  Detectives had few leads in the case, and received no cooperation from Solly's family, particularly his mother, Edna Bolt, who consistently denied knowing her son's whereabouts.  Eventually, Solly's escape was considered a [[cold case (criminology)|cold case]].&lt;ref name="njdoc" /&gt;

Solly eventually made his way to Florida, where he assumed the identity of [[Vincent Taylor (musician)|Vinnie Taylor]], lead guitarist of the [[rock 'n' roll]] revival group [[Sha Na Na]].  The real Taylor died of a heroin overdose in 1974, but using forged documents, including a [[Social Security number|Social Security card]], a [[birth certificate]], and a [[baptism]] certificate, Solly successfully passed himself off as Taylor.&lt;ref name="moran" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt;  Solly, posing as Taylor, claimed that Taylor's death had been staged and so he took on the new [[stage name]] of Daniel "Danny C" Catalano, and began performing and recording under that name.&lt;ref name="tisch" /&gt;  Sha Na Na discovered the fraud and demanded that Solly cease performing as Danny C.  When Solly refused, the group considered filing a lawsuit, but decided not to do so in order to deny Solly the free publicity the case would generate.&lt;ref name="tisch" /&gt;

==Investigation and capture==
In 1999, [[New Jersey State Police]], Louis Kinkle, and [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland County]] Sheriff's Office investigators reopened the Solly case.  They enlisted the aid of [[Forensic science|forensic artist]] [[Frank Bender]], who used 25-year-old photographs of Solly to create an image of what he would look like currently.  In March 2000, Edna Bolt died, after which other members of Solly's family began cooperating with investigators.  Bolt's husband Harry told police that Solly was living in Florida as a singer using the name Danny C.  A web search revealed a website for Danny C, billing himself as the "Bad Boy" of Sha Na Na.  The site featured a picture of Danny C that closely resembled the image produced by Bender.&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="courttv" /&gt;

Based on this information, authorities traveled first to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and then to [[St. Pete Beach, Florida|St. Pete Beach]].&lt;ref name="tisch" /&gt;  They discovered Solly fishing on a pier near his apartment complex.  [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] arrested Solly on May 10, 2001, and he was returned to New Jersey on May 18.  He was convicted on October 5 for his 1974 escape and was incarcerated at Riverfront State Prison in [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] to serve that sentence and the remainder of his manslaughter sentence.  Solly was granted [[parole]] in August 2003 for good behavior and time served. He was last reported to be living in a [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] motel in New Jersey before his death.&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt;

'''Euclid Tsakalotos''' ({{lang-el|Ευκλείδης Τσακαλώτος}}, officially Ευκλείδης Στεφάνου Τσακαλώτος,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/vouleftes/viografika-stoicheia/?MPId=94978a5c-ac45-4d1d-a7da-eebb0784b82e Hellenic Parliament: MPs' contact details] Note: Modern Greek middle names are typically a [[patronymic]] in the [[Genitive case#Greek|genitive case]]; thus, ''Stefanou'' from his father's name, ''Stefanos''.&lt;/ref&gt; transcr. ''Efklidis Stefanou Tsakalotos'', {{IPA-el|efˈkliðis steˈfanu t͜sakaˈlotos}}; born 1960) is a left-wing Greek economist and politician who has been [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Minister of Finance of Greece]] since 2015. He is also a member of the Central Committee of [[Syriza]] and has represented [[Athens B]] in the [[Hellenic Parliament]] since [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|May 2012]].

Tsakalotos was born in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], but moved to the United Kingdom at a young age. He went to [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's School]] in London before studying [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]]. He went on to complete a master's degree at the [[Institute of Development Studies]], attached to the [[University of Sussex]] and returned to Oxford to complete a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in economics under the supervision of [[Włodzimierz Brus]], which he did in 1989. From 1989 to 1993, Tsakalotos worked at the [[University of Kent]], where he met his partner, [[Heather D. Gibson]]. He moved to Greece, and taught at the [[Athens University of Economics and Business]] from 1994 to 2010, becoming a professor of economics. Since 2010, he has been a professor of economics at the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]]. He has written a number of books in both Greek and English and has been published in a range of different academic journals.

A student member of the [[Communist Party of Greece (Interior)|Communist Party of Greece]], Tsakalotos joined [[Synaspismos]] in the early 1990s and was elected to the Central Committee of Syriza in 2004 shortly after their formation. He was first elected as a Member of the Hellenic Parliament for Athens B in the May 2012 legislative election and has been re-elected in every election since. In [[Shadow Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|opposition from 2012 to 2015]], he was Syriza's shadow finance minister. When [[First Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|Syriza entered government]] in January 2015, Tsakalotos was appointed as an Alternate Minister within the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. In April, he took over as head of Greece's negotiating team on the [[Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece|third bailout package]]. On 6 July 2015, following [[Yanis Varoufakis]]'s resignation, Tsakalotos was appointed as Minister of Finance. He was [[Second Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|re-appointed in September 2015]] following the [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|snap legislative election]].

== Early life and education ==
Tsakalotos was born in [[Rotterdam]], the [[Netherlands]], in 1960. He is the son of Stefanos Tsakalotos, a civil engineer who worked in the shipping industry, and the family relocated to the United Kingdom in 1965 when the younger Tsakolotos was five years old.&lt;ref name="katsandoni"&gt;Κατσαντώνη, Χριστίνα, "[http://www.thetoc.gr/magazine/eukleidis-tsakalwtos-o-anthrwpos-sti-skia-tou-gbaroufaki ΕυκλειδηΣ ΤσακαλωτοΣ: Ο ανθρωποΣ στη "σκια" του Γ.Βαρουφακη]", ''The Times of Change Magazine'' Τρίτη, 07 Ιουλίου 2015.

Tsakalotos went on to read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]]. Whilst at the Queen's College, Tsakalotos was an admirer of both [[Gerald Cohen]] and [[Andrew Glyn]], a [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] and [[Marxian economics|Marxian economist]] respectively, who both taught at the university. He also took part in student protests against [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government.&lt;ref name=profile /&gt; During his time at university, he became a supporter of [[Irish republicanism]], a view he expressed in his visit to the [[Sinn Féin]] [[ardfheis]] in March 2015.&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/07/charles-moores-notes-why-the-greek-no-is-a-great-moment-for-socialism/|title=Why the Greek No is a great moment for socialism|date=11 July 2015|work=The Spectator|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last1=Moore|first1=Charles|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his university friends at this time, [[Yannis Stournaras]], later became a Greek finance minister and served as Governor of the [[Bank of Greece]].&lt;ref name=katsandoni /&gt; Following graduation, he completed a master's degree (MPhil) at the [[Institute of Development Studies]], attached to the [[University of Sussex]]. He then returned to Oxford to complete a [[Doctorate of Philosophy|doctorate]] (DPhil) in economics, studying at [[Mansfield College, Oxford|Mansfield College]]. He completed this doctorate in 1989 under the supervision of [[Włodzimierz Brus]], with his thesis, ''[[Alternative Economic Strategies: The Case of Greece]]'', later being published as a book.&lt;ref name="nla"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative economic strategies: the case of Greece / Euclid Tsakalotos|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1521330|website=National Library of Australia|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mfa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gr/en/leadership/the-deputy-ministers/alternate-foreign-minister-for-international-economic-relations.html|title=Alternate Foreign Minister for International Economic Relations|website=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]|accessdate=8 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628003554/http://www.mfa.gr/en/leadership/the-deputy-ministers/alternate-foreign-minister-for-international-economic-relations.html|archivedate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tsakaescg"&gt;Tsakalotos, Euclid, Heather Gibson, ed., ''Alternative Economic Strategies: The Case of Greece'' ([[Aldershot]], Avebury Publishers: 1991), {{ISBN|1856281833}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ix}}

== Academic career ==
After the completion of his doctorate, Tsakalotos entered into an academic career. His first role was as a research associate at the [[University of Kent]], from 1989 to 1990. From October 1990 to June 1993, he taught at the university as a lecturer.&lt;ref name="tsakaescg"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tutor&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pragnell|first1=Chris|title=University tutor Euclid Tsakalotos has become chief bail-out negotiator for Greece|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/canterbury/news/former-lecturer-tasked-with-rescuing-36355/|accessdate=14 August 2015|work=[[Kent Online]]|date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Tsakalotos and his wife moved to Greece, and in October 1994 he began teaching at the [[Athens University of Economics and Business]].&lt;ref name="mfa" /&gt; In September 2010, he became a full professor of economics at the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]], more commonly referred to simply as the University of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://uoa.academia.edu/EuclidTsakalotos Euclid Tsakalotos: National &amp; Kapodistrian University of Athens]. uoa.academia.edu. Retrieved 6 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In his capacity as an academic, Tsakalotos served as a member of the executive committee of the Hellenic Federation of University Teachers' Associations (POSDEP).&lt;ref name="mfa" /&gt; In the mid-2000s, Tsakalotos led his students in a several months-long protest against proposed reforms to the Greek education system. Thanos Tsouknidas, an accountant that knew Tsakalotos at the time, said: "He was there, involved in the struggle. We were fighting together."&lt;ref name=kambas /&gt; His active role in the teachers' union brought him popularity, and according to a former student, his classes were often packed.&lt;ref name="kambas" /&gt;

Tsakalotos has written a number of books and articles on Greek and international economic policies, alone and in cooperation with other academics and writers. He has co-authored a number of works with his wife, who has also served as editor for some of the works that he has written alone.{{efn|Some of Tsakalotos' work has sparked debate in academic circles, leading to some articles being published in response to his work.

== Early political career ==
As a student at the University of Oxford, Tsakalotos joined the [[Communist Party of Greece (Interior)]], a [[Eurocommunism|eurocommunist]] party that had split from the main [[Communist Party of Greece]], a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] party, in 1968. In the early 1990s, shortly after moving to Greece, Tsakalotos became a member of [[Synaspismos]], a radical left-wing political party, which was to become the largest constituent party of [[Syriza]].&lt;ref name=hsmith&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Helena|title=Euclid Tsakalotos: Greece's secret weapon in credit negotiations|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/euclid-tsakalotos-greeces-secret-weapon-in-credit-negotiations|accessdate=6 July 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syriza itself was formed in 2004, ahead of that year's [[Greek legislative election, 2004|legislative election]], as a coalition of 13 left-wing political parties in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/whogreek|title=Who are the Greek left?|date=22 May 2012|website=Workers' Liberty|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsakalotos was elected to their Central Committee in December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{el}} [http://www.syriza.gr/page/boyleytes.html The Greek Government] syriza.gr.

In the [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|May 2012 legislative election]], Tsakalotos was elected as a Member of the [[Hellenic Parliament]] (MP) representing [[Athens B]], the largest electoral district in Greece. The election saw Syriza win 16.8% of the vote, placing second behind [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]], who won 18.8% of the vote, and ahead of [[PASOK]], with 13%. [[Alexis Tsipras]], the party leader, was unable to form a coalition, but also refused to enter into one with PASOK, forcing the country to new elections in [[Greek legislative election, June 2012|June 2012]], where Tsakalotos won re-election as an MP. Tsakalotos said that Syriza had a focus on the [[European Union]], and told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that a Europe imposing austerity on its citizens for the actions of banks "isn't the Europe that the original inspirators of Europe imagined".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/12/world/europe/in-greece-leftist-party-syriza-upends-politics.html|title=Leftist Party's Rise Upends Greek Political Order|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|date=11 May 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=18 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Democracy won a plurality of seats in June 2012 and formed a coalition government with PASOK and [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]], making Syriza the largest opposition party with 78 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/world/europe/greek-elections.html|title=Supporters of Bailout Claim Victory in Greek Election|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|date=17 June 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=18 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsakalotos' role in opposition was as the spokesperson for economic affairs in Tsipras' [[Shadow Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|shadow cabinet]].&lt;ref name=ekat&gt;{{cite news|title=SYRIZA's shadow cabinet to exercise 'hands-on opposition'|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/142852/article/ekathimerini/news/syrizas-shadow-cabinet-to-exercise-hands-on-opposition|accessdate=10 July 2015|work=Ekathimerini|date=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition from 2012 to 2015, Tsakalotos was a key proponent of Syriza's economic policy. He argued that Greece needed something similar to the [[Marshall Plan]], with a payment scheme that took into account the strength of the economy. He told [[Bloomberg News]] that "People say that we are responsible for the situation we find ourselves in. OK, sure.

September 2013 saw his book, co-authored with [[Christos Laskos]], published by [[Pluto Press]]. ''[[Crucible of Resistance]]'' was described as offering "badly needed correctives" to the prevalent ideas on the Greek situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://souciant.com/2014/01/inside-merkels-greece/|title=Inside Merkel's Greece|date=15 January 2014|work=Souciant|access-date=18 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book addressed why the [[European debt crisis]] began, with a particular focus on Greece. It argued that the idea Greece was exceptional was a myth and that the crisis had revealed the inadequacies of [[neoliberalism]] and [[social democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.plutobooks.com/display.asp?K=9780745333809|title=Crucible of Resistance|website=Pluto Press|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsakalotos was criticised by elements of the Greek media in 2013 when he was accused of living a wealthy lifestyle while criticising austerity in public. He was dubbed the 'aristocrat of the left', and one newspaper published front-page criticism arguing that Tsakalotos' own family wealth came from investments made by companies such as [[JPMorgan Chase]] and [[BlackRock]].&lt;ref name="katsandoni" /&gt;

In December 2014, the Hellenic Parliament did not approve the new [[President of Greece|President]] with the supermajority required, and so a [[snap election]] was called for the end of January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/11315842/Greece-to-hold-snap-elections-as-parliament-refuses-to-approve-new-president.html|title=Greece to hold snap elections as parliament refuses to approve new president|last=Waterfield|first=Bruno|date=29 December 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=18 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days before the 2015 election took place, Tsakalotos was quizzed on Syriza's economic policies by a number of economists, debt campaigners and investment analysts at the [[London School of Economics]]. Tsakalotos said there was a need for [[fiscal space]], meaning 6–7&amp;nbsp;billion [[Euro]]s a year to spend on an expansionary [[fiscal policy]]. He also said that they would cancel the austerity budgets already agreed with the [[European Union]] (EU) and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), pay back the loans from the IMF and focus on rescheduling and [[Write-off|writing off]] the loans from the EU.&lt;ref name="imptri"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Michael|title=Syriza, the economists and the impossible triangle|url=https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/syriza-the-economists-and-the-impossible-triangle/|website=Michael Roberts Blog|accessdate=14 August 2015|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economicbrain"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mason|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul Mason (journalist)|title=Inside Syriza's economic brain|url=http://blogs.channel4.com/paul-mason-blog/Greece-syriza-election/2941|website=Channel 4 News|accessdate=14 August 2015|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|legislative election]] on 25 January 2015, Syriza won a near-majority of seats, with 149 out of 300, and so formed a coalition with the right-wing anti-austerity party [[Independent Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/25/greece-election-vote-austerity-leftwing-syriza-eu|title=Greece elections: anti-austerity Syriza party sweeps to stunning victory|last=Henley|first=Jon|date=26 January 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=18 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsipras became [[Prime Minister of Greece|prime minister]] and formed his [[First Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|cabinet]] on 27 January, appointing Tsakalotos as Alternate Minister for International Economic Relations, subordinate to the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], [[Nikos Kotzias]].&lt;ref name="cnbc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cosgrave|first1=Jenny|title=Euclid Tsakalotos, the new 'friendly face' of Greece?|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102650151|accessdate=6 July 2015|publisher=CNBC|date=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsakalotos described his role as follows: "[It] means coordinating our approach to promoting exports and attracting investment.

Tsakalotos represented Syriza at the Sinn Féin ardfheis on 7 March 2015 and gave a speech on the conference floor, during which he said that both Sinn Féin and Syriza are "part of a great realignment in European politics" towards left-wing anti-austerity parties.

Tsakalotos began to gain a more prominent role in the renegotiations with Greece's creditors over a new bailout plan, which at the time were being led by Yanis Varoufakis, the [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Minister of Finance]]. On 27 April, Tsakalotos was the made the coordinator of the Greek team negotiating with the creditor's representatives over this new bailout plan. This move was largely seen as sidelining [[Yanis Varoufakis]], the [[Minister of Finance (Greece)|Minister of Finance]], but the markets reacted positively.&lt;ref name=cassidy&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cassidy|first1=John|title=Sidelining Varoufakis Won't Solve Greece's Real Problem|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/sidelining-varoufakis-wont-solve-greeces-real-problem|accessdate=14 December 2015|work=The New Yorker|date=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chrys&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chrysopoulos|first1=Philip|title=Varoufakis Downsized as Tsipras Forms New Greek Negotiating Team|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/04/27/varoufakis-downsized-as-tsipras-forms-new-greek-negotiating-team/|accessdate=6 July 2015|work=Greek Reporter|date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, lenders warned that time was running out for a deal to be agreed on a new bailout plan.

The bailout referendum on 5 July resulted in a 'No' vote to the adoption of the bailout package. The following day, Varoufakis resigned as finance minister.

A new bailout deal, the [[Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece]], was agreed in August 2015, and the first set of measures went to vote on 14 August, in the form of the [[Eleventh austerity package (Greece)|eleventh austerity package]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33934238|title=Greece crisis: Eurogroup agrees to third bailout|date=14 August 2015|publisher=BBC News|access-date=18 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsakalotos opened the debate, calling the deal a "very tough agreement with many thorns."

=== Reappointment as Minister of Finance ===
[[Reuters]] reported that Tsakalotos was considering not running in the September 2015 legislative election, as he did not want to have to implement the bailout agreement.&lt;ref name=rift&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maltezou|first1=Renee|last2=Babington|first2=Deepa|title=With election near, Tsipras faces widening rift within Syriza|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/08/28/us-eurozone-greece-syriza-idUKKCN0QX1SF20150828|accessdate=10 September 2015|agency=Reuters|date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these fears were assuaged by Alexis Tsipras when he said there was no doubt that Tsakalotos would stand in the election.&lt;ref name=softenstand&gt;{{cite news|last1=Papadimas|first1=Lefteris|last2=Maltezou|first2=Renee|title=Tsipras softens stand on Greek debt relief before election|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/08/26/us-eurozone-greece-election-idUKKCN0QV1NI20150826|accessdate=10 September 2015|agency=Reuters|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that, during the election campaign, without Tsakalotos' involvement, there would have been no bailout package. In recognition of that, Tsakalotos was made to head the list for Syriza in Athens B. In an interview during the campaign, Tsakalotos admitted that the Greek government had suffered "defeat" during negotiations with creditors, implying that some responsibility for this lay with his predecessor, Varoufakis.&lt;ref name=prospect&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilson|first1=George|title=Tsakalotos sees prospect of limited improvements to new bailout memorandum|url=http://www.thetoc.gr/eng/economy/article/tsakalotos-sees-prospect-of-limited-improvements-to-new-bailout-memorandum|accessdate=10 September 2015|work=The Times of Change|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the re-election of the Syriza-ANEL coalition, Tsakalotos was tipped to resume the role of Minister of Finance,&lt;ref name=keep&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wearden|first1=Graeme|last2=Smith|first2=Helena|title=Euclid Tsakalotos expected to keep cabinet place|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/sep/21/greek-elections-tsipras-sworn-in-pm-bailout-live#block-55fffe4ee4b00e7fa159820d|accessdate=22 September 2015|work=The Guardian|date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the state media reported that he was reluctant to do so.&lt;ref name=kambas2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maltezou|first1=Renee|last2=Kambas|first2=Michele|title=Tsipras to back Greek bailout with Tsakalotos as finance minister|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/09/22/eurozone-greece-cabinet-idUKL5N11S0YQ20150922|agency=Reuters|date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he was reappointed as Minister of Finance on 23 September, as part of the [[Second Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|Tsipras' second cabinet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greece keeps Euclid Tsakalotos as finance minister after election win|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/greece-keeps-euclid-tsakalotos-as-finance-minister-after-election-win|accessdate=11 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chouliarakis, the interim Minister of Finance, was retained in the finance ministry as an Alternate Minister of Finance.&lt;ref name=team&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Helena|title=Greece: Alexis Tsipras retains economics team in cabinet with unenviable task|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/23/greece-alexis-tsipras-cabinet-unenviable-task|accessdate=11 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in September, in an interview with the ''Financial Times'', Tsakalotos said that it was "absolutely critical that we get something on debt relief." He added: "By the second quarter of 2016, if we get a positive review, bank recapitalisation and debt relief, I don’t see any reason why there shouldn’t be a return to growth." He also said that the new government would make serious attempts to crack down on tax evasion: "It will be a central aspect of our policies, which will determine the success of the government, because it’s the only way the Greek people will accept difficult measures that show we’re all in the same boat."&lt;ref name="upbeat"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barber|first1=Tony|last2=Hope|first2=Kerin|title=Greek finance minister upbeat on growth prospects|url=https://next.ft.com/content/956f3cb6-6507-11e5-9846-de406ccb37f2|accessdate=5 June 2016|work=Financial Times|date=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the annual meetings of the IMF and the [[World Bank]] between 9 and 11 October 2015, Tsakalotos had a number of meetings with high-level attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Treasury Secretary stresses importance of debt relief in meeting with FinMin Tsakalotos|url=http://www.amna.gr/english/article/11592/U.S.-Treasury-Secretary-stresses-importance-of-debt-relief-in-meeting-with-FinMin-Tsakalotos|accessdate=15 October 2015|work=ANA-MPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tsakalotos – Lagarde meeting took place in positive climate|url=http://english.capital.gr/News.asp?id=2384012|accessdate=15 October 2015|work=Capital.gr|date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 January 2016, Tsakalotos began a tour of European cities, including Rome, Lisbon, Paris, Helsinki and Berlin, meeting with finance ministers, prior to a Eurogroup meeting on 14 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ekathimerini.com/204898/article/ekathimerini/news/athens-irked-by-suggestion-review-will-be-drawn-out|title = Athens irked by suggestion review will be drawn out|date = 8 January 2016|work = Kathimerini|access-date = 10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, Spyros Economides, Director of the Hellenic Observatory, commented on Tsakalotos' performance as Minister of Finance: "In some ways, he has done an extremely good job because the mess left by his predecessor both in substantive and presentational terms was horrific."&lt;ref name="macd"&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacDowell|first1=Andrew|title=Greek Finance Minister Tsakalotos Grudgingly Placates Creditos|url=http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/3524818/asset-management-macro/greek-finance-minister-tsakalotos-grudgingly-placates-creditors.html?ArticleId=3524818#/.V2cWjtQrI1I|accessdate=19 June 2016|work=Institutional Investor|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsakalotos visited the [[European Parliament]] in March 2016 and told [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] of the [[European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs|Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs]] that he welcomed their role in monitoring the reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160302IPR16694/greek-finance-minister-euclid-tsakalotos-welcomes-ep-role-in-monitoring-reforms|title=Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos welcomes EP role in monitoring reforms|date=2 March 2016|website=European Parliament|access-date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bailout review and calls for IMF involvement ===
The first review of the bailout programme carried out by Greece's lenders stalled in February 2016 over pension reforms. Speaking to ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', Tsakalotos urged the lenders to complete the review by 1 May as "This question of time is important if we want to move from a vicious to a virtuous circle."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-idUSKCN0W9153|title=Greece urges completion of reform review by May 1|last=Bellon|first=Tina|date=7 March 2016|agency=Reuters|access-date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to other members of the Eurogroup on 6 May to appeal for their support against extra demands for austerity that, he argued, were beyond the mandate of the Greek government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2016/05/08/greek-finance-minister-appeals-to-eurozone-colleagues-political-empathy-slams-imf-math/|title=Greek Finance Minister Appeals to Eurozone Colleagues' Political Empathy, Slams IMF Math|last=Walker|first=Marcus|date=8 May 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in October 2016, Tsakalotos said that he wanted the IMF to join the bailout programme and that [[Wolfgang Schäuble]]'s position on debt relief for Greece was untenable. Schäuble said that the bailout programme "will work, the IMF will be on board and there won't be much debt relief." However, Tsakalotos said that "Something has to give there, and I think deep down in his heart he understands that. He's a wily politician. He's been around for a long time. I can't believe he doesn't understand you can't have all those three things."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-08/greece-s-tsakalotos-says-german-position-on-debt-is-unrealistic|title=Greece's Tsakalotos Says German Position on Debt Is Unrealistic|last=Argitis|first=Theophilis|date=8 October 2016|work=Bloomberg News|last2=Lacqua|first2=Francine|access-date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political views ==

===Ideology===
Tsakalotos has been described as a "[[Marxist]]",&lt;ref name=profile /&gt;&lt;ref name=somer&gt;{{cite news|title=Synchronised somersault|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21667963-prime-minister-pivots-away-leftism-and-his-party-follows-synchronised-somersault|accessdate=11 October 2015|work=The Economist|date=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ovenden has written that "While [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]] is the main economic reference point for Varoufakis, who opposed the Brussels deal, for Tsakalotos, who signed it, Marx is more that guide to economic and political analysis."&lt;ref&gt;Ovenden, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]] described Tsakalotos as a "classic Marxist of the [[New Left]]," continuing that "Tsakalotos comes from that school of Marxism which learned from the 1970s onwards to make compromises with capitalist reality."&lt;ref name="nonerr"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mason|first1=Paul|title=Syriza's reshuffle: step forward a non-erratic Marxist|url=http://blogs.channel4.com/paul-mason-blog/syrizas-reshuffle-step-nonerratic-marxist/3613|accessdate=25 June 2016|work=Channel 4 News|date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the ''Financial Times'' in September 2015, following his re-appointment, he said: "I’m one of the government’s most left-wing ministers, politically speaking. However, I want to do things like the recapitalisation of the banks. I can do things that aren’t particularly left-wing."&lt;ref name=upbeat /&gt;

Tsakalotos is also a leading member of the Group of 53, a prominent faction within Syriza. One report names him as the leader of the Group.&lt;ref name=anastasia&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anastasia|first1=Balezdrova|title=The situation is favourable for New Democracy but Greeks may give Tsipras a second chance|url=http://www.grreporter.info/en/situation_favourable_new_democracy_greeks_may_give_tsipras_second_chance/13237|accessdate=20 September 2015|work=GR Reporter|date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Group was founded in mid-2014 and stands ideologically between the Left Platform and Alexis Tsipras's core backers.&lt;ref&gt;Ovenden, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nektaria&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nektaria|first1=Stamouli|title=Greece's Alexis Tsipras Struggles to Keep Syriza Party Together|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/greeces-alexis-tspiras-faces-growing-challenge-of-a-disintegrating-party-1440594654|accessdate=20 September 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Left Platform split from Syriza to [[Popular Unity (Greece)|Popular Unity]], the Group of 53 became the most left-wing faction within Syriza.&lt;ref name=somer /&gt;

===Europe===
Tsakalotos has been described as a "Revolutionary Europeanist", as he supports European Union integration but not its capitalist principles. In one article, he wrote: "[the] European Monetary Union has created a split between [the] core and periphery, and relations between the two are hierarchical and discriminatory."&lt;ref name=kambas /&gt; Tsakalotos has also advocated for a "change in [the] architecture" of the [[Eurozone]]. He has also suggested that the EU should have a focus on the [[Development economics|development]] of member countries, which is what requires this change in architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/euclid-tsakalotos/europe-of-two-narratives|title=A Europe of two narratives|last=Tsakalotos|first=Euclid|date=27 December 2016|work=OpenDemocracy|access-date=18 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2012 interview on ''Lateline'', Tsakalotos said: "At the moment the Eurozone is at risk, not because of the Greek radical left – it's at risk because it has an architecture, a financial and economic architecture that is evidently unable to deal with the crisis in the Eurozone, and we think part of the solution is a change in that architecture."&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Greece 'can do better' than German deal|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2012/s3503667.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he cited a move towards [[fiscal federalism]] as a potential solution to the EU's economic architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsakalotos|first=Euclid|year=2011|title=Contesting Greek Exceptionalism within the European crisis|url=http://www.e-history.eu/files/uploads/Paper_-_2011.05.16.pdf|journal=Hellenic Observatory|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Tsakalotos is married to [[Heather D. Gibson]], a Scottish economist currently serving as Director-Advisor to the Bank of Greece and his ofttimes research and writing partner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2227">'''Europeans for Financial Reform''' ('''EFFR''') is a coalition dedicated to effecting reform in the financial and banking sectors. EFFR was created in Brussels on September 21, 2009, just over a year after the collapse of [[Lehman Brothers]] and the beginning of the [[financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efinancialnews.com/homepage/content/1055221370&lt;/ref&gt;   

EFFR pursues a campaign called "Regulate Global Finance Now!", which was launched September 21, 2009.  The goals of this campaign are to raise awareness of the need for financial reform and to get governments to do adopt following reforms:

*To regulate speculative funds, such as [[hedge funds]] and [[private equity funds]]
*To create a [[financial transaction tax]]
*To regulate executive and shareholder bonus and remuneration
*To close down [[tax havens]]
*To protect consumers from toxic financial products and [[predatory lending]], and
*To democratise finance&lt;ref&gt;http://europeansforfinancialreform.org/en/system/files/CALL_TO_ACTION.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The founding members of the coalition were the [[Global Progressive Forum]], [[European Trade Union Confederation]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etuc.org/a/7506&lt;/ref&gt; the Foundation for European Progressive Studies, [[Solidar]] and [[UNI Global Union]].&lt;ref&gt;http://europeansforfinancialreform.org/en/node/217&lt;/ref&gt;  

Europeans for Financial Reform is open to the membership of other NGOs, trade unions and think tanks, as well as individuals.  It is not officially linked to any political party, although politicians can join the campaign as individuals.  One high-profile politician involved in the campaign is former Prime Minister of Denmark [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]]&lt;ref&gt;http://europolitics.abccom.cyberscope.fr/new-coalition-wants-real-financial-reform-art248458-1.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Europeans for Financial Reform is associated with its counterpart in the United States, [[Americans for Financial Reform]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/en/opinion/ideological-divides-rule-g20/article-185706#&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1979''' was the 24th edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was held on 31 March 1979 in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], following the country's win at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978 edition]]. The event was staged at the [[International Convention Center (Jerusalem)|International Convention Center]]. The presenters were [[Daniel Pe'er]] and [[Yardena Arazi]].

The winner was [[Israel]] with the song "[[Hallelujah (Gali Atari and Milk &amp; Honey song)|Hallelujah]]", performed by [[Gali Atari]] and [[Milk and Honey (artist)|Milk and Honey]]. Therefore, this was Israel's consecutive second win, and overall second win, in the contest. 19 countries participated, the 20 countries that took part at the previous 1978 Contest, except for [[Turkey]] which was also going to participate but eventually withdrew its entry for political reasons. [[Yugoslavia]], who missed the 1978 Contest, also didn't want to take part nor transmit the 1979 show for political reasons. As well as being broadcast live in the 19 competing countries, the contest was broadcast in [[Turkey]], [[Romania]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Iceland]].

As of 2018, it was the last time the contest was held in March.

== Location ==
{{details|topic=the host city|Jerusalem}}
[[File:Binyanei-HaUmah.JPG|200px|thumb|left|International Convention Center, Jerusalem – host venue of the 1979 contest.]]
Located on a plateau in the [[Judaean Mountains|Judean Mountains]] between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the [[Dead Sea]], Jerusalem is one of the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest cities in the world]]. In the ancient [[cuneiform]], Jerusalem was called "Urusalima", meaning "City of Peace", during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;BC The Archaeology of the Bible Lands by Magnus Magnusson. BBC Publications London. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered [[Holy city|holy]] to the three major [[Abrahamic religions]]—[[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].

== Format ==

Each country had a jury who awarded 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 point(s) for their top ten songs. This was the last year in which the points were announced via order of appearance, as opposed to order of preference.

The voting was extremely close. Israel gained a good lead in the early stages of the voting, but Spain eventually caught up and took a good lead themselves. At the close of the penultimate jury's votes, Israel were one point behind Spain, and only the Spanish jury had yet to give their votes. Spain ended up giving Israel 10 points, causing the crowd to erupt into enormous cheers.

== Participating countries ==
At one point before the contest [[Turkey]] was going to participate. The country would have appeared 11th on stage (between Israel and France), represented by [[Maria Rita Epik]] and [[21. Peron]] with the song "[[:tr:Seviyorum (şarkı)|Seviyorum]]" ("I'm Loving"). However Turkey was forced to retire from the contest under pressure from Arab states who objected to a predominantly Muslim country taking part in a contest held in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John Kennedy. ''The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History''. Carlton Books, UK. 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they however took part in Jerusalem [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|20 years later]].

=== Returning artists ===
The contest saw the return of four artists who had participated in previous editions of the contest: France's representative [[Anne-Marie David]] was the winner for [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest 1973|Luxembourg in 1973]], Netherlands' [[Sandra Reemer|Xandra]] represented the country in [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]] and [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]], Norway's [[Anita Skorgan]] represented [[Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977|the country in 1977]], and Switzerland's [[Peter, Sue and Marc]] represented the country in [[Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971]] and [[Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]].

=== Conductors ===

For each nation's performance, the orchestra was conducted by the following:

{{div col end}}

== Results ==
The following tables reflect the confirmed, verified scores, which were adjusted after the live broadcast. During the voting announcement, due to a misunderstanding by the presenter Yardena Arazi, Spain appeared to award 10 points to both Portugal and Israel and these scores were added to the scoreboard. After the programme, verification confirmed that Portugal should only have received six points, leaving the total Portuguese score reduced by four points to 64.

The Koncerthuset at Radiohuset in Copenhagen, Denmark, was the host venue for the 1986 edition of the Eurovision Young Musicians.&lt;ref name=Show/&gt;

Radiohuset (literally "Radio House") is the former headquarters of national [[Denmark|Danish]] broadcaster [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]], located on [[Rosenørns Allé]] in [[Frederiksberg]], [[Copenhagen]].

Vacated by DR when [[DR Byen]] was inaugurated in 2006, the buildings now house the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]] as well as the Museum of Music. The complex also contains a 1,200 seat concert hall, Koncerthuset.

'''Facilitation''' in [[business]], [[organizational development]] (OD), and in [[consensus decision-making]] refers to the process of designing and running a successful [[meeting]].

Facilitation concerns itself with all the tasks needed to run a [[productivity (economics)|productive]] and impartial meeting. Facilitation serves the needs of any group who are meeting with a common purpose, whether it be making a decision, solving a problem, or simply exchanging ideas and information. It does not [[leadership|lead]] the group, nor does it try to distract or to entertain.  A slightly different interpretation focuses more specifically on a group that is engaged in [[experiential learning]].&lt;ref name=Heron&gt;Heron, J. ''The Complete Facilitator's Handbook'', (1999) Kogan Page {{ISBN|0-7494-2798-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular this is associated with [[active learning]] and concepts of [[tutor|tutelary]] authority. This is covered in-depth in the research work of [[John Heron]] at the [[University of Surrey]] and the International Centre for [[Cooperative inquiry|Co-operative Inquiry]].

== Aspects ==
;The role of the [[facilitator]] (see below): The role of facilitator only emerged as a separate set of skills in the 1980s. It has similarities to the traditional [[Chair (official)|Chair]] or [[secretary]] roles in a meeting but goes beyond them to actively participate and guide the group towards consensus.
;Setting ground rules: Often disregarded by those untrained in facilitation, setting ground rules is a key component of the facilitation process especially in meetings convened to discuss difficult problems or for training.  These rules are usually reiterated in some form at the outset of a facilitated meeting or workshop to ensure participants understand the various roles being employed and the responsibilities accorded to each.  Certain aspects feature highly such as:
:* being open to suggestions
:* building on what is there, not knocking down ideas
:* allowing others space (to speak or express themselves)
:* mutual respect
:* that the facilitator does not own the topic under discussion and the identity of that owner is clear
:* rules of engagement such as time-outs and procedures that will be adopted
:* how unresolved issues will be captured and dealt with
:* Finally it is key that, during the meeting, it is clear that the owner of the topic is not expected to intervene to impose ideas beyond setting out parameters for consideration or to give insight. The facilitator in this respect owns the process of the meeting.
These are all closely associated with the idea of facilitation as a tool of (workplace) [[empowerment]].&lt;ref name=Heron/&gt;
;Consulting with the client: A facilitator will work with a client who is someone in an organisation, or diverse group, who is calling them and has invited the facilitator to assist. They will try to understand the purpose and outcome of the meeting by discussing it with the client.
;Making arrangements for the [[meeting]]: The practical arrangements will be arranged or managed by the facilitator. They will also consider in detail the location and layout of the room. They will research the meeting beforehand to understand why it is being held and that all [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] are invited and able to attend.
;Setting the [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]]: They will understand in detail how each item on the agenda is to be tackled and how long it should take.  Using specialist techniques they will allow participants to understand all the issues at stake and all alternative courses of action.  The Facilitator designs the process (agenda) based on his or her discussions with the participants and the Facilitator's process expertise.
;Understanding group [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]: They will not make assumptions about the way people interact and will try to adapt to the ways of different cultures and organisations.
;Understanding [[group dynamics]]: Whilst tackling the practical aspects of a meeting they remain aware of undercurrents, both verbal and non-verbal, which may indicate problems the group is having. The facilitator may try to assist the group in becoming aware of these.

==The role of the facilitator==
:''See [[Facilitator]] for details of exactly how a facilitator might run a meeting.''

It is important to note that the tasks and responsibilities listed below do not need to be covered by a single facilitator.  The role of the facilitator is often shared by multiple people, for instance one person may arrange the logistics before the meeting, another person may keep time and monitor the agenda during the meeting, and a third person may be responsible for recording agreements.

*Prior to a meeting, facilitators:
** research the meeting
** find out the purpose and goal (if any) of the meeting
** establish who needs to attend
** draw up a draft agenda and design the group processes to attain the necessary results
** share the agenda with potential attendees, changing it as necessary
** ensure everyone gets fully briefed for the meeting and that everyone knows the purpose and potential consequences of the meeting
*During the meeting, facilitators:
** monitor the agenda
** keep time
** manage the group process
** encourage participation from all attendees
** help participants understand different points of view
** foster solutions that incorporate diverse points of view
** manage participant behaviour
** create a safe environment
** teach new thinking skills and facilitate structured thinking activities
** record (with an agreed phraseology) agreements. They may also note unresolved issues for later debate.
*The facilitator may write up and publish the results of the meeting to everyone concerned  including those who could not attend.

==The form of meeting==
A meeting usually means everyone is together in the same room at the same time and this is the major situation in which facilitation is practiced. With the introduction of modern telecommunications the field has grown to embrace other forms of meetings:
;Same time same place: The traditional meeting in a room with all parties present at the same time.
;Same time different place: The teleconference with either all parties at separate locations  or with some in geographically dispersed sub meetings, all with audio / video connection.
;Different time same place: A meeting focussing on a particular physical location where people contribute as they pass by. A wall mounted notice board and/or  poster display which allows individuals to add comments as they pass is one example .  A survey using un-networked computers in a kiosk would also be a "different time same place" meeting.
;Different time different place: Meeting via a web link such as discussion groups, forums, blogs, and [[usenet]]. Specialist web-enabled group decision support software exists. Wikipedia discussion pages fall into this category.

'''Freaknik''' was an annual [[spring break]] meeting in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], primarily of students from [[historically black colleges and universities]].&lt;ref name="Suggs"&gt;{{cite news

The event increased in size and popularity in the 1990s with dancing, drinking, parties, a basketball tournament, rap sessions, a [[film festival]] and a [[job fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Freaknik was immortalized in Tom Wolfe’s novel A Man in Full, 1998.

==History==
Freaknik was conceived in March 1983 in a dorm room on the second-floor of Thurman Hall at Morehouse College when Pat Stanback, a member of the DC Metro Club, was challenged by a member of the California Club about who would throw the biggest party. Pat brought the idea to the President of the DC Metro club and they voted on the name and sponsored the first Freaknik in April, 1983 at Piedmont Park in Atlanta. The first few years alternated between John White Park and Adams Park with them announcing the location at the last minute in hopes of evading police.

Many students from the AUC, Atlanta University Center, attended and partied to music provided by Flash Attack Inc. DJ Bam Bam Barney and DJ Flash did the first 2 annual gatherings.  As it grew, the festival attracted upwards of 250,000 revelers to the city. However, as the freaknik grew in attendance Atlantans' reception of the festival was mixed. Many residents had attended and enjoyed Freaknik since it was started. Otherwise, Freaknik went largely unnoticed by most of the city.

The problems with Freaknik began in 1993, when the number of people coming to Atlanta for the event suddenly doubled to more than 80,000.

Many residents believe the City of Atlanta was caught off guard in 1993 by the increased number of people who came to the city for Freaknik. In some areas, the massive increase in cars on the road caused traffic to come to a halt, and the revelers got out of their cars and danced in the streets. This in turn caused panic in some areas where people could not get home from their jobs, and they were trapped in areas where many revelers started harassing and yelling obscenities at residents. There were also several reports of violence, looting, rapes and other sexual assaults. All this showed Freaknik in a negative light, and Atlanta residents demanded that the city get control of the event.&lt;ref name=A&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prairie.org/events/23726/should-we-freak-out-over-freaknik |title=Should We Freak Out Over Freaknik? – IL Humanities |website=Prairie.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redandblack.com/1998/04/16/atlanta-is-killing-off-spirit-of-freaknik/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927130713/http://www.redandblack.com/1998/04/16/atlanta-is-killing-off-spirit-of-freaknik/ |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirby |first=Joseph A. |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970418&amp;slug=2534551 |title=Atlanta Braces Itself For Annual 'Freaknik' Spring Break |work=Seattle Times Newspaper |date=1997-04-18 |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/freaknik-not-just-another-467432.html |title=Atlanta News / Georgia News Section &amp;#124; AJC |website=Ajc.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajc.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/ajc/town-talk/entries/2008/04/14/as_the_best_par.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504013813/http://www.ajc.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/ajc/town-talk/entries/2008/04/14/as_the_best_par.html |archivedate=2008-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freaknik moves===

Many Atlanta residents filed lawsuits and business and community leaders pressured Mayor Bill Campbell to end Freaknik or severely crack down on the event.  By 1996, the Atlanta police were out in large numbers, making it difficult for the revelers to party in the streets and engage in other illegal behavior.&lt;ref name=A/&gt; After city leaders took measures to curtail Freaknik's accessibility, its popularity faded. As a result, Freaknik moved East of Atlanta to Memorial Drive in [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]], then to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]].  By 1999, celebration of the festival had died down due to heightened police security.

In April 2010, Atlanta officials said "there are no permitted Freaknik-related events inside the city limits." Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed also said that "he will be tough and even sue organizers of any Freaknik-related activities who violate city guidelines".&lt;ref&gt;

==Career==
Bellini enlisted in the [[Italian Air Force]] in 1977 and attended the Italian [[Accademia Aeronautica]] (Air Force Academy). He was then trained as a pilot at [[Laughlin Air Force Base]] in the United States. He has a degree in [[Political Science]] from the [[Federico II University]] in [[Naples]],  and a [[Master's degree]] in Strategic Studies from the [[Air War College]] at [[Air University (United States)|Air University]], based at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]] in [[Alabama]], [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Gulf War===
On the eve of the [[Operation Desert Storm]] the Italian government deployed eight [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]] [[Ground attack aircraft|Fighter-bombers]] on the [[Persian Gulf|Gulf]] [[Theater (warfare)|Theatre of Operations]]. On January 16, 1991, coalition forces began concentrated [[air strike]]s on [[Iraqi Republican Guard|Iraqi military]] targets in [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]].

On January 18, 1991 an Italian [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]] piloted by Major Gianmarco Bellini with Captain [[Maurizio Cocciolone]] as his [[flight officer|navigator]] took off as part of a multi national 10 plane flight. Bellini and Cocciolone were the only members of the flight able to execute [[in-flight refueling]], while the other 9 aircraft failed and had to abort the mission. The mission profile dictated that the operation could be performed even by a single plane, so Bellini and Cocciolone went on. Their plane was hit by Iraqi [[anti aircraft]] fire and they had to eject. They were captured by the [[Iraqi Republican Guard]], even though their status was unknown at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Verona.

While Cocciolone was shown on Iraqi [[television]] on January 20, 1991 in a propaganda video,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=bio, Cocciolone, Maurizio|url=http://www.pownetwork.org/gulf/cd024.htm|publisher=Pow Network|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  no news of Bellini was given initially, and he was feared to be a casualty. The two were kept separate for the whole time of their captivity. On March 3, 1991 both officers were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marchesini|first=Giuliano|title=Un paese in festa per Bellini vivo|url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,0004/articleid,0860_02_1991_0055_0004_25858159/|accessdate=27 October 2012|newspaper=[[La Stampa]]|date=4 March 1991|page=4|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bellini holds numerous military decorations including the silver Medal for Military Valor for his actions during the Operation Desert Storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interrogazione a risposta scritta 4-08369 |url=http://banchedati.camera.it/sindacatoispettivo_16/showXhtml.Asp?idAtto=28620&amp;stile=6&amp;highLight=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218071358/http://banchedati.camera.it/sindacatoispettivo_16/showXhtml.Asp?idAtto=28620&amp;stile=6&amp;highLight=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 February 2013 |publisher=Camera.it |accessdate=27 October 2012 |language=Italian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellini and Cocciolone were the only Italian [[Prisoners of War]] of the entire war.

===Later career===
Bellini was later appointed commanding officer of the [[Ghedi]] air base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bellini, l' eroe del Golfo, a capo della base di Ghedi|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2001/settembre/20/Bellini_eroe_del_Golfo_capo_co_5_0109206601.shtml|accessdate=27 October 2012|newspaper=[[Corriere della Sera]]|date=20 September 2001|page=49|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/peace/Cam-Nig%2020060612.pdf Greentree Agreement] was the formal treaty which resolved the [[Cameroon]]-[[Nigeria]] border dispute over the oil and natural gas rich Bakassi peninsula.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]] Conflict Encyclopedia, Cameroon, Peace Agreements, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=28&amp;regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa#&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute had roots as far back as 1913,&lt;ref&gt;Implications of the Bakassi conflict resolution for Cameroon, Francis Menjo Baye, 2010, pg. 2, http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?ots591=0c54e3b3-1e9c-be1e-2c24-a6a8c7060233&amp;lng=en&amp;id=119860&lt;/ref&gt; 1981,&lt;ref name="Bassey &amp; Oshita"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassey &amp; Oshita|title=Governance and Border Security in Africa|publisher=Malthouse|isbn=9788422071|page=231|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wYZ6tQG9G9IC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=cameroon+nigeria+bakassi+dead+soldiers+1981&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m4c49HzK0e&amp;sig=QeR2qMvdQNjas_xJpCf0ptISgTM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I4mIVJP7CsmqggT684KQDg&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=cameroon%20nigeria%20bakassi%20dead%20soldiers%201981&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1994, and 1996 armed clashes between Nigeria and Cameroon took place in [[Bakassi]].&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt;
The dispute was referred to the [[International Court of Justice]] and on 10 October 2002 the ICJ ruled in favor of Cameroon.&lt;ref&gt;Cameroun Bakassi peninsula - No war for oil, 12/11/2002, http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/403&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 2006, Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] and Cameroonian President [[Paul Biya]], signed the '''Greentree Agreement''' concerning the withdrawal of troops and transfer of authority in the Peninsula. The withdrawal of Nigerian troops was set for 60 days but allowed for a possible 30-day extension while Nigeria was allowed to keep its civil administration and police in [[Bakassi]] for another two years.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt;
 
A follow-up committee, composed of representatives from Cameroon, Nigeria, the UN, Germany, the USA, France and the UK, was created to monitor the implementation of the agreement.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt;

On August 13, 2013 the [[United Nations Security Council]] stated that it welcomed the peaceful end two days earlier of the special transitional regime in the Bakassi Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, Cameroon; Nigeria: Bakassi Peninsula Transition Completed, Aug 13 2013, https://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp3_l205403677_text&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermann Adam Widemann''' (December 24, 1822 – February 7, 1899) was a businessman from [[Germany]] who was a judge and member of the cabinet of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].

==Life==
Widemann was born in [[Hanover, Germany]] on December 24, 1822.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |title= Hawaiians Mourn: Herman A. Widemann Dies After a Prolonged Sickness |newspaper= The Independent |location= Honolulu |date= February 7, 1899  |page= 3 |url=  http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047097/1899-02-07/ed-1/seq-3  |accessdate= June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a teenager he went to work on a [[whaling]] ship. He came to live in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in 1846, after stopping in 1843.
He came briefly to the [[California Gold Rush]] in 1849, but returned after his companion John von Pfister was murdered.&lt;ref name="kauai"/&gt;{{rp|149}}
He married a [[native Hawaiian]] Kaumana "Mary" Kapoli in 1854 and lived in [[Lihue, Hawaii|Līhu{{okina}}e]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marriage Record Book for island of Kauai |url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/vitalsta/index/assoc/HASH018e/2f442b21.dir/doc.pdf |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628105515/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/vitalsta/index/assoc/HASH018e/2f442b21.dir/doc.pdf |archivedate=June 28, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He became sheriff of the [[Kauai|island of Kaua{{okina}}i]] in 1854, was elected to the house of representatives in the [[legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom]] in 1855, and in 1863 appointed its circuit judge.&lt;ref name="office"&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183837/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH015e/1ccf4a86.dir/Widemann%2C%20Hermann%20A.jpg |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH015e/1ccf4a86.dir/Widemann,%20Hermann%20A.jpg |title=Widemann, Hermann A. office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He started one of the first [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantations in Hawaii]] known as  [[Grove Farm (Lihue, Hawaii)|Grove Farm]].
During the [[American Civil War]] he supported the Confederate States.&lt;ref name="kauai"&gt;{{cite book |title= Kauai: The Separate Kingdom |author= Edward Joesting |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |year=1988 |isbn= 978-0-8248-1162-4 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GfWj0Pt3cwoC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|180}}

After selling Grove Farm to its manager [[George Norton Wilcox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= History |work= Grove Farm web site |url= http://www.grovefarm.com/history |accessdate= June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1865, he moved to [[Honolulu]] to work in the capital. On July 10, 1869 he was appointed to the kingdom's supreme court, despite never having any formal law school training.
On February 18, 1874 he was appointed to the cabinet as minister of the interior until May 28, 1874, as well as on the [[Privy Council]], the board of education, commissioner of [[crown lands]], president of the bureau of immigration, and board of health.&lt;ref name="office"/&gt;
In 1878 he started the [[Waianae Sugar Company]] in the [[Waianae, Hawaii|Wai{{okina}}anae]] district of [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Cultural History of Wai‘anae |publisher= State of Hawaii |url= http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/czm/initiative/wec/html/people/culthist.htm |accessdate= June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 1891 he was appointed as Minister of Finance to [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]], but had to resign two weeks later on March 10. He was temporarily replaced by [[Samuel Parker (Hawaii)|Samuel Parker]], and then [[John Mott-Smith]]. After Mott-Smith was sent to [[Washington, DC]] to attempt to negotiate a trade treaty, Parker served again briefly until Widemann resumed his duties as minister of finance.
He also filled in briefly as [[Attorney General]] from July 27, 1892 to August 29, 1892.&lt;ref name="office"/&gt;

After the 1893 [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]], Widemann was sent with Parker and [[John Adams Cummins]] to [[Washington, DC]],  in an attempt to get international support for its restoration
He then continued to [[London]], and [[Berlin]] but was never successful.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

Widemann was interviewed by US Commissioner [[James H. Blount]] in preparing his [[Blount Report]] on May 20, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Blount Report: Affairs in Hawaii |url= http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/annexation/blount/br1001.html |pages=1001–1004 |accessdate= June 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was the first to experiment with the ''Guatemalan'' variety of [[Coffea|coffea tree]], which turned out to be well-adapted to higher elevations; it became the most popular variety through modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10524/432 |title=Ethnic Groups and the Coffee Industry in Hawaii |author=Baron Goto |year=1982 |volume=16 |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society |pages= 112–124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died February 7, 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Part 2 Glossary (T-Z) |work= Hawaiian Encyclopedia |url= http://www.hawaiianencyclopedia.com/part-2-glossary-t-z.asp |accessdate= June 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=H.

After a funeral in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace]], he was buried in [[Oahu Cemetery]].
He was survived by two sons and seven daughters.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

His daughter [[Wilhelmina Kekelaokalaninui Widemann Dowsett|Wilhelmina Widemann]] organized the first [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] club in the [[Territory of Hawaii]] in 1912. His son Carl Widemann married Helen Umiokalani Parker, daughter of [[Samuel Parker (Hawaii)|Samuel Parker]] in July 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= The Story of Maui Royalty: The Parkers of Waimea |author= Kapiikauinamoku  |title=Second Son of Parkers, Palmer, Died As Youth |date= May 23, 1956 |url= http://ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?e=q-0somr-000Sec--11en&amp;a=d&amp;d=D0.4.27&amp;toc=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= A Beautiful Wedding |newspaper= The Independent |location= Honolulu |date= July 21, 1899 |page= 4 |url=  http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047097/1899-07-21/ed-1/seq-4 |accessdate= June 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and Symptoms --&gt;
'''Hypothermia''' is reduced body temperature that happens when a body dissipates more heat than it absorbs. In humans, it is defined as a body [[core temperature]] below {{convert|35.0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Symptoms depend on the temperature.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; In mild hypothermia there is [[shivering]] and [[mental confusion]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; In moderate hypothermia shivering stops and confusion increases.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; In severe hypothermia, there may be [[#Paradoxical undressing|paradoxical undressing]], in which a person removes their clothing, as well as an increased risk of the [[cardiac arrest|heart stopping]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown DJ, Brugger H, Boyd J, Paal P | title = Accidental hypothermia | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 367 | issue = 20 | pages = 1930–8 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23150960 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1114208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause, mechanism and diagnosis --&gt;
Hypothermia has two main types of causes. It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold.&lt;ref name=Rosen2010/&gt; It may also occur from any condition that decreases heat production or increases heat loss.&lt;ref name=Rosen2010&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |page=1870 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly this includes [[alcohol intoxication]] but may also include [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]], and advanced age.&lt;ref name=Rosen2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; [[Human body temperature|Body temperature]] is usually maintained near a constant level of {{convert|36.5|–|37.5|C|F}} through [[thermoregulation]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Efforts to increase body temperature involve shivering, increased voluntary activity, and putting on warmer clothing.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robertson|first1=David|title=Primer on the autonomic nervous system|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier/AP|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780123865250|page=288|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FycmOkb-T1gC&amp;pg=PA288|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908151245/https://books.google.com/books?id=FycmOkb-T1gC&amp;pg=PA288|archive-date=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypothermia may be diagnosed based on either a person's symptoms in the presence of risk factors or by measuring a person's core temperature.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing, and physical activity.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; In those with moderate hypothermia, heating blankets and warmed [[intravenous fluid]]s are recommended.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; In severe hypothermia, [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] (ECMO) or [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] may be useful.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; In those without a [[pulse]], [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) is indicated along with the above measures.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Rewarming is typically continued until a person's temperature is greater than {{convert|32|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; If there is no improvement at this point or the blood potassium level is greater than 12&amp;nbsp;mmol/liter at any time, resuscitation may be discontinued.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and prognosis --&gt;
Hypothermia is the cause of at least 1,500 deaths a year in the United States.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; It is more common in older people and males.&lt;ref name=Brac2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bracker|first1=Mark|title=The 5-Minute Sports Medicine Consult|date=2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9781451148121|page=320|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LOm9enAxQ8C&amp;pg=PA320|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908151245/https://books.google.com/books?id=-LOm9enAxQ8C&amp;pg=PA320|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the lowest documented body temperatures from which someone with accidental hypothermia has survived is {{convert|13.0|C|F}} in a near-drowning of a 7-year-old girl in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarkable recovery of seven-year-old girl|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=4296666|accessdate=2 March 2015|date=Jan 17, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307183116/http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=4296666|archivedate=7 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survival after more than six hours of CPR has been described.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; For those for whom ECMO or bypass is used, survival is around 50%.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Deaths due to hypothermia have played an important role in many wars.&lt;ref name=Rosen2010/&gt; The term is from [[Greek language|Greek]] ὑπο, ''ypo'', meaning "under", and θερμία, ''thermía'', meaning "heat". The opposite of hypothermia is [[hyperthermia]], an increased body temperature due to failed thermoregulation.&lt;ref name=NC08/&gt;&lt;ref name=CC09/&gt;

Hypothermia is often defined as any body temperature below {{convert|35.0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=Rosen2006/&gt; With this method it is divided into degrees of severity based on the [[core temperature]].&lt;ref name="Rosen2006"/&gt;

Another classification system, the Swiss staging system, divides hypothermia based on the presenting symptoms which is preferred when it is not possible to determine an accurate core temperature.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

Other cold-related injuries that can be present either alone or in combination with hypothermia include:

*[[Chilblains]]: condition caused by repeated exposure of skin to temperatures just above freezing. The cold causes damage to small blood vessels in the skin. This damage is permanent and the redness and itching will return with additional exposure. The redness and itching typically occurs on cheeks, ears, fingers, and toes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/coldstress/coldrelatedillnesses.html|title=CDC - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic - Cold Stress - Cold Related Illnesses|date=2018-06-06|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[normal human body temperature]] is often stated as {{convert|36.5|–|37.5|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karakitsos D, Karabinis A | title = Hypothermia therapy after traumatic brain injury in children | journal = N.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms vary depending on the degree of hypothermia, and may be divided by the three stages of severity.  Infants with hypothermia may feel cold when touched, with bright red skin and an unusual lack of energy.&lt;ref name=webmd&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-hypothermia What Is Hypothermia?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116080023/http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-hypothermia |date=2014-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mild===
Symptoms of mild hypothermia may be vague,&lt;ref name=Care99/&gt; with sympathetic nervous system excitation (shivering, [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], [[tachypnea|fast respiratory rate]], and [[vasoconstriction|contraction of blood vessels]]).

===Moderate===
Low body temperature results in shivering becoming more violent. Muscle mis-coordination becomes apparent.&lt;ref name=sterba/&gt;&lt;ref name=francis&gt;{{cite journal |author=Francis, TJR |title=Immersion hypothermia |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=28 |issue=3 |year=1998 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5975 |accessdate=2008-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208181253/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5975 |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cheung&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheung SS, Montie DL, White MD, Behm D | title = Changes in manual dexterity following short-term hand and forearm immersion in 10 degrees C water | journal = Aviat Space Environ Med | volume = 74 | issue = 9 | pages = 990–3 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14503680 | doi =  | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2003/00000074/00000009/art00013 | accessdate = 2008-06-11 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629184715/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2003/00000074/00000009/art00013 | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Movements are slow and labored, accompanied by a stumbling pace and mild confusion, although the person may appear alert. Surface blood vessels contract further as the body focuses its remaining resources on keeping the vital organs warm. The subject becomes pale. Lips, ears, fingers, and toes may become blue.

===Severe===
As the temperature decreases, further physiological systems falter and [[heart rate]], [[respiratory rate]], and [[blood pressure]] all decrease. This results in an expected heart rate in the 30s at a temperature of {{convert|28|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="Marx 2010 p.1869" /&gt;

Difficulty speaking, sluggish thinking, and [[amnesia]] start to appear; inability to use hands and stumbling are also usually present. Cellular metabolic processes shut down. Below {{convert|30|C|F}}, the exposed skin becomes blue and puffy, muscle coordination very poor, and walking almost impossible, and the person exhibits incoherent or irrational behavior, including terminal burrowing (see below) or even [[stupor]]. Pulse and [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] rates decrease significantly, but fast heart rates (ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation) can also occur. Atrial fibrillation is not typically a concern in and of itself.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Major [[Organ failure|organs fail]] and [[clinical death]] occurs.

=== Paradoxical undressing ===
Twenty to fifty percent of hypothermia deaths are associated with paradoxical undressing. This typically occurs during moderate and severe hypothermia, as the person becomes disoriented, confused, and combative. They may begin discarding their clothing, which, in turn, increases the rate of heat loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The word: Paradoxical undressing – being-human |year=2007 |author=New Scientist |journal=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19426002.600-the-word-paradoxical-undressing.html |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209024834/http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19426002.600-the-word-paradoxical-undressing.html |archivedate=2008-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid541627"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wedin B, Vanggaard L, Hirvonen J | title = "Paradoxical undressing" in fatal hypothermia | journal = J.

Rescuers who are trained in mountain survival techniques are taught to expect this; however, people who die from hypothermia in urban environments are sometimes incorrectly assumed to have been subjected to sexual assault.&lt;ref name=Forensic06&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ramsay, David |author2=Michael J.

One explanation for the effect is a cold-induced malfunction of the [[hypothalamus]], the part of the brain that regulates body temperature. Another explanation is that the muscles contracting peripheral blood vessels become exhausted (known as a loss of [[Vascular resistance|vasomotor tone]]) and relax, leading to a sudden surge of blood (and heat) to the extremities, causing the person to feel overheated.&lt;ref name=Forensic06/&gt;&lt;ref name=LegalMed&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rothschild MA, Schneider V | year = 1995 | title = 'Terminal burrowing behaviour'—a phenomenon of lethal hypothermia | url = | journal = Int J Legal Med | volume = 107 | issue = 5| pages = 250–6 | pmid = 7632602 | doi=10.1007/BF01245483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[Image:HypothermiaAge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The rate of hypothermia is strongly related to age in the United States]]
Hypothermia usually occurs from exposure to low temperatures, and is frequently complicated by [[Ethanol|alcohol]] consumption.&lt;ref name=Rosen2010/&gt; Any condition that decreases heat production, increases heat loss, or impairs thermoregulation, however, may contribute.&lt;ref name="Rosen2010"/&gt; Thus, hypothermia risk factors include: [[substance abuse]] (including alcohol abuse), [[homelessness]], any condition that affects judgment (such as hypoglycemia), the extremes of age, poor clothing, chronic medical conditions (such as hypothyroidism and [[sepsis]]), and living in a cold environment.&lt;ref name=Baum08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Hypothermia-related deaths—United States, 1999–2002 and 2005 | journal = MMWR Morb.

In urban areas, hypothermia frequently occurs with chronic cold exposure, such as in cases of homelessness, as well as with immersion accidents involving drugs, alcohol or mental illness.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-11-09|title=Hypothermia: Background, Pathophysiology, Etiology|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/770542-overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; While studies have shown that homeless people are at risk of premature death from hypothermia, the true incidence of hypothermia-related deaths in this population is difficult to determine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In more rural environments, the incidence of hypothermia is higher among people with significant comorbidities and less able to move independently.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With rising interest in wilderness exploration, and outdoor and water sports, the incidence of hypothermia secondary to accidental exposure may become more frequent in the general population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Alcohol===
Alcohol consumption increases the risk of hypothermia in two ways: [[vasodilation]] and temperature controlling systems in the brain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Goodman &amp; Gilman's: The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (13 ed.) |last=Mihic |first=John |last2=Koob |first2=George |last3=Mayfield |first3=Jody |last4=Harris |first4=Adron |last5=Brunton |first5=Laurence |last6=Hilal-Dandan |first6=Randa |last7=Knollmann |first7=Björn | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |year=2017 |isbn=1259584739 |location=|pages= |chapter=Ethanol}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine (20 ed.) |last=Danzl |first=Daniel |last2=Jameson |first2=Larry |last3=Fauci |first3=Anthony |last4=Kasper |first4=Dennis |last5=Hauser |first5=Stephen| name-list-format = vanc |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2018|isbn=1259644030|location=|pages=|chapter=Hypothermia and Peripheral Cold Injuries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasodilation increases blood flow to the skin, resulting in heat being lost to the environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This produces the effect of an individual ''feeling'' warm, when they are actually losing heat.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Alcohol also affects the temperature-regulating system in the brain, decreasing the body's ability to shiver and use energy that would normally aid the body in generating heat.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The overall effects of alcohol lead to a decrease in body temperature and a decreased ability to generate body heat in response to cold environments.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Alcohol is a common risk factor for death due to hypothermia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Between 33% and 73% of hypothermia cases are complicated by alcohol.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Water immersion===
[[File:Hypothermia_Training,_Marine_Mountain_Warfare_Center,_California_USA.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Two American marines participating in an  immersion hypothermia exercise]]

Hypothermia continues to be a major limitation to swimming or [[Underwater diving|diving]] in cold water.&lt;ref name=sterba/&gt; The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which consequently increases the risk of other injuries.&lt;ref name=sterba/&gt;&lt;ref name=cheung/&gt;

Other factors predisposing to immersion hypothermia include [[dehydration]], inadequate rewarming between [[Dive profile#Repetitive diving|repetitive dives]], starting a dive while wearing cold, wet [[dry suit]] undergarments, [[Perspiration|sweating]] with work, inadequate [[thermal insulation]] (for example, thin dry suit undergarment), and poor [[Physical exercise|physical conditioning]].&lt;ref name=sterba/&gt;

Heat is lost much more quickly in water&lt;ref name=sterba&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sterba, JA |title=Field Management of Accidental Hypothermia during Diving |journal=US Naval Experimental Diving Unit Technical Report |volume=NEDU-1-90 |year=1990 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4248 |accessdate=2008-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727224238/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4248 |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; than in air. Thus, water temperatures that would be quite reasonable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia in survivors, although this is not usually the direct clinical cause of death for those who are not rescued. A water temperature of {{convert|10|C|F}} can lead to death in as little as one hour, and water temperatures near freezing can cause death in as little as 15 minutes.&lt;ref name="Hypothermia safety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usps.org/national/ensign/uspscompass/compassarchive/compassv1n1/hypothermia.htm |accessdate=2008-02-19 |title=Hypothermia safety |publisher=[[United States Power Squadrons]] |date=January 23, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208180845/http://www.usps.org/national/ensign/uspscompass/compassarchive/compassv1n1/hypothermia.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of this occurred during the [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the ''Titanic'']], when most people who entered the {{convert|-2|C|F}} water died in 15&amp;ndash;30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sinking of the RMS Titanic#CITEREFButler1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual cause of death in cold water is usually the [[Involuntary action|bodily reactions]] to heat loss and to freezing water, rather than hypothermia (loss of core temperature) itself. For example, plunged into freezing seas, around 20% of victims die within two minutes from [[cold shock response|cold shock]] (uncontrolled [[hyperventilation|rapid breathing]], and gasping, causing water inhalation, massive increase in blood pressure and cardiac strain leading to [[cardiac arrest]], and [[panic]]); another 50% die within 15–30 minutes from [[cold incapacitation]] (inability to use or control limbs and hands for swimming or gripping, as the body "protectively" shuts down the peripheral muscles of the limbs to protect its core).&lt;ref name="Vittone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mariovittone.com/2010/10/the-truth-about-cold-water/|title=The Truth About Cold Water|last=Vittone|first=Mario| name-list-format = vanc |date=21 October 2010|work=Survival|publisher=Mario Vittone|accessdate=24 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114154556/http://mariovittone.com/2010/10/the-truth-about-cold-water/|archivedate=14 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhaustion and unconsciousness cause drowning, claiming the rest within a similar time.&lt;ref name="Hypothermia safety"/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
{{HumanTemperature}}
Heat is primarily generated in muscle tissue, including the heart, and in the liver, while it is lost through the skin (90%) and lungs (10%).&lt;ref name=Care99/&gt; Heat production may be increased two- to four-fold through muscle contractions (i.e. exercise and shivering).&lt;ref name=Care99/&gt; The rate of heat loss is determined, as with any object, by [[convection]], [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]], and [[radiation]].&lt;ref name=Care99/&gt; The rates of these can be affected by [[body mass index]], body [[surface area]] to [[volume]] ratios, clothing and other environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nuckton TJ, Claman DM, Goldreich D, Wendt FC, Nuckton JG | title = Hypothermia and afterdrop following open water swimming: the Alcatraz/San Francisco Swim Study | journal = Am J Emerg Med | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 703–7 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11043627 | doi = 10.1053/ajem.2000.16313  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many changes to physiology occur as body temperatures decrease. These occur in the cardiovascular system leading to the [[Osborn wave|Osborn J wave]] and other dysrhythmias, decreased [[central nervous system]] electrical activity, [[diuresis#Cold-induced diuresis|cold diuresis]], and [[Pulmonary edema#Non-cardiogenic|non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |pages=1869–1870 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that glomerular filtration rates (GFR) decrease as a result of hypothermia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Broman M, Källskog O | title = The effects of hypothermia on renal function and haemodynamics in the rat | journal = Acta Physiologica Scandinavica | volume = 153 | issue = 2 | pages = 179–184 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7778458 | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-1716.1995.tb09849.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, hypothermia increases [[preglomerular vasoconstriction]], thus decreasing both renal blood flow (RBF) and GFR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Broman M, Källskog O, Kopp UC, Wolgast M | title = Influence of the sympathetic nervous system on renal function during hypothermia | journal = Acta Physiologica Scandinavica | volume = 163 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–249 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9715736 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-201x.1998.00356.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:HypothermiaECG.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Atrial fibrillation]] and [[Osborn wave|Osborn J wave]]s in a person with hypothermia.  Note what could be mistaken for [[ST elevation]].]]
Accurate determination of core temperature often requires a special low temperature thermometer, as most clinical thermometers do not measure accurately below {{convert|34.4|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="McCullough L, Arora S 2004 2325–32"/&gt;  A low temperature thermometer can be placed in the rectum, esophagus or bladder. Esophageal measurements are the most accurate and are recommended once a person is [[intubated]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Other methods of measurement such as in the mouth, under the arm, or using an [[infrared]] ear thermometer are often not accurate.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

As a hypothermic person's heart rate may be very slow, prolonged feeling for a pulse could be required before detecting. In 2005, the [[American Heart Association]] recommended at least 30–45 seconds to verify the absence of a pulse before initiating CPR.&lt;ref name=ACLS05&gt;{{cite journal | author = ECC Committee, Subcommittees and Task Forces of the American Heart Association | title = 2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care | journal = Circulation | volume = 112 | issue = 24 Suppl | pages = IV–136 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16314375 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166550 | url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-136 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110324012223/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-136 | archivedate = 2011-03-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others recommend a 60-second check.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

== Prevention ==
Appropriate clothing helps to prevent hypothermia. [[Synthetic fabric|Synthetic]] and [[wool]] fabrics are superior to cotton as they provide better insulation when wet and dry. Some synthetic fabrics, such as polypropylene and polyester, are used in clothing designed to wick perspiration away from the body, such as liner socks and moisture-wicking undergarments. Clothing should be loose fitting, as tight clothing reduces the circulation of warm blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topics: Cold Stress|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/coldstress/|publisher=National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=21 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314001040/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/coldstress/|archivedate=14 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In planning outdoor activity, prepare appropriately for possible cold weather. Those who drink alcohol before or during outdoor activity should ensure at least one sober person is present responsible for safety.

Covering the head is effective, but no more effective than covering any other part of the body. While common folklore says that people lose most of their heat through their heads, heat loss from the head is no more significant than that from other uncovered parts of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sessler DI, Moayeri A, Støen R, Glosten B, Hynson J, McGuire J | title = Thermoregulatory vasoconstriction decreases cutaneous heat loss | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 656–60 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2221434 | doi = 10.1097/00000542-199010000-00011 | first6 = Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Sample, Ian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/dec/17/medicalresearch-humanbehaviour|title=Scientists debunk myth that most heat is lost through head &amp;#124; Science|work=The Guardian|date=December 18, 2008|accessdate=June 23, 2010|location=London|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905083755/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/dec/17/medicalresearch-humanbehaviour|archivedate=September 5, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, heat loss from the head is significant in infants, whose head is larger relative to the rest of the body than in adults.

Building a shelter can aid survival where there is danger of death from exposure.  Shelters can be of many different types, metal can conduct heat away from the occupants and is sometimes best avoided. The shelter should not be too big so body warmth stays near the occupants.  Good ventilation is essential especially if a fire will be lit in the shelter.  Fires should be put out before the occupants sleep to prevent [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning. People caught in very cold, snowy conditions can build an [[igloo]] or [[snow cave]] to shelter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wildearth.org/blog/how-to-build-an-igloo-survive-a-blizzard-finish-your-mission-on-time How to build an Igloo, survive a blizzard, finish your mission on time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201204942/http://wildearth.org/blog/how-to-build-an-igloo-survive-a-blizzard-finish-your-mission-on-time |date=2014-02-01 }} This web page gives basic instructions for westerners.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilderness-survival.net/cold-7.php Cold Weather Survival, Shelkters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118144516/http://www.wilderness-survival.net/cold-7.php |date=2014-01-18 }} This has instructions about building different types of shelter&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressiveness of treatment is matched to the degree of hypothermia.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; Treatment ranges from noninvasive, passive external warming to active external rewarming, to active core rewarming.&lt;ref name="McCullough L, Arora S 2004 2325–32"/&gt; In severe cases resuscitation begins with simultaneous removal from the cold environment and management of the airway, breathing, and circulation. Rapid rewarming is then commenced. Moving the person as little and as gently as possible is recommended as aggressive handling may increase risks of a [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]].&lt;ref name=ACLS05/&gt;

[[Hypoglycemia]] is a frequent complication and needs to be tested for and treated. Intravenous [[thiamine]] and [[glucose]] is often recommended, as many causes of hypothermia are complicated by [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, Sixth edition |last=Tintinalli |first=Judith | name-list-format = vanc |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |isbn=0-07-138875-3 |page=1181 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[National Health Service]] advises the lay public against putting a person in a hot bath, massaging their arms and legs, using a heating pad, or giving them alcohol. These measures can cause blood to be directed to the skin, causing a fall in blood pressure to vital organs, potentially resulting in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treating hypothermia|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/hypothermia/Pages/treatment.aspx|publisher=NHS|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914061911/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/hypothermia/Pages/treatment.aspx|archivedate=September 14, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is usually recommended not to declare a person dead until their body is warmed to a near normal body temperature of greater than {{convert|32|C|F}},&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; since extreme hypothermia can suppress heart and brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Iyer A, Rajkumar V, Sadasivan D, Bruce J, Gilfillan I | title = No one is dead until warm and dead | journal = The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery | volume = 134 | issue = 4 | pages = 1042–3 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17903527 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2007.05.028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions include if there is an obvious fatal injuries or the chest is frozen so that it cannot be compressed.&lt;ref name=ACLS05/&gt; If a person was buried in an [[avalanche]] for more than 35 minutes and is found with a mouth packed full of snow without a pulse, stopping early may also be reasonable.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt; This is also the case if a person's blood potassium is greater than 12&amp;nbsp;mmol/l.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Between 1995 and 2004 in the United States, an average of 1560 cold-related emergency department visits occurred per year and in the years 1999 to 2004, an average of 647 people died per year due to hypothermia.&lt;ref name=Baum08&gt;Baumgartner, Hypothermia and Other Cold-Related Morbidity Emergency Department Visits: United States, 1995–2004 Wilderness and Environmental Medicine, 19, 233 237 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5615a3.htm#tab |title=Hypothermia-Related Mortality – Montana, 1999–2004 |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424001921/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5615a3.htm#tab |archivedate=2009-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of deaths reported between 1999 and 2002 in the US, 49% of those affected were 65 years or older and two-thirds were male.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/654/epidemiology|title=BMJ Best Practice|website=bestpractice.bmj.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most deaths were not work related (63%) and 23% of affected people were at home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hypothermia was most common during the autumn and winter months of October through March.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the United Kingdom, an estimated 300 deaths per year are due to hypothermia, whereas the annual incidence of hypothermia-related deaths in Canada is 8000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Prianishnikov 1812.jpg|thumb|The armies of [[Napoleon]] retreat from Russia in 1812.]]
[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner 081.jpg|thumb|''[[Snow-storm: Hannibal and His Army Crossing the Alps]]'', [[J. M. W. Turner]]]]
Hypothermia has played a major role in the success or failure of many military campaigns, from [[Hannibal]]'s loss of nearly half his men in the [[Second Punic War]] (218 [[Before Christ|B.C.]]) to the [[French invasion of Russia#Retreat and losses|near destruction]] of [[Napoleon]]'s armies in [[Russia]] in 1812.  Men wandered around confused by hypothermia, some lost consciousness and died, others shivered, later developed [[torpor]], and tended to sleep.  Others too weak to walk fell on their knees; some stayed that way some time resisting death.  The [[pulse]] of some was weak and hard to detect; others groaned; yet others had eyes open and wild with quiet delirium.&lt;ref name=Guly/&gt; Loss of life to hypothermia in Russian regions continued through the [[World War I|first]] and [[World War II|second]] world wars, especially in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |page=1868 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian examples of deaths caused by hypothermia occurred during the sinkings of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] and [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']], and more recently of the [[MS Estonia|MS ''Estonia'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Findings: Titanic victims in 'cold shock'|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/169325.article|accessdate=22 November 2014|page=24 May 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129131742/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/169325.article|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=John Updike|title=Remember the Lusitania|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/07/01/remember-the-lusitania|accessdate=22 November 2014|date=1 July 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129040244/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/07/01/remember-the-lusitania|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soomer et al., 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soomer H, Ranta H, Penttilä A | title = Identification of victims from the M/S Estonia | journal = International Journal of Legal Medicine | volume = 114 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 259–262 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11355406 | doi = 10.1007/s004140000180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antarctic]] explorers developed hypothermia; [[Ernest Shackleton]] and his team measured body temperatures "below 94.2°, which spells death at home", though this probably referred to oral temperatures rather than core temperature and corresponded to mild hypothermia.  One of [[Robert Falcon Scott|Scott's]] team, Atkinson, became confused through hypothermia.&lt;ref name=Guly&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guly|first1=H|title=History of accidental hypothermia.|journal=Resuscitation|date=Jan 2011|volume=82|issue=1|pages=122–5|pmid=21036455|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.09.465|pmc=3060344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nazi human experimentation]] during [[World War II]] amounting to [[medical torture]] included [[Nazi human experimentation#Freezing experiments|hypothermia experiments]], which killed many victims. There were 360 to 400 experiments and 280 to 300 subjects, indicating some had more than one experiment performed on them. Various methods of rewarming were attempted, "One assistant later testified that some victims were thrown into boiling water for rewarming".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=RL|title=Nazi science--the Dachau hypothermia experiments.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=May 17, 1990|volume=322|issue=20|pages=1435–40|pmid=2184357|doi=10.1056/NEJM199005173222006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
Many animals other than humans often induce hypothermia during [[hibernation]] or [[torpor]].

Water bears ([[Tardigrade]]), microscopic multicellular organisms, can survive [[freezing]] at low temperatures by replacing most of their internal water with the [[sugar]] [[trehalose]], preventing the crystallization that otherwise damages [[cell membranes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9903">'''James W. Pumphrey''' (September 12, 1832 – March 16, 1906)  was the owner of a livery stable in Washington, D.C., and played a minor role in the events surrounding the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]] and its aftermath. [[John Wilkes Booth]] hired a horse from Pumphrey that he used to escape with after he assassinated [[Abraham Lincoln|the President]].

==Early life and family==
James Pumphrey was born in Washington, D.C., to Levi Pumphrey and Sarah Pumphrey née Miller, and was one of six children.  Upon the death of his father, being the eldest son, James inherited a [[livery stable]] at the corner of C Street and 6th Street.

James Pumphrey had two "[[Common-law marriage|common law]]" marriages and fathered seven children.  He and his first wife, Margaret, had two children:  Ida Elizabeth and James W., Jr.  With his second wife, Mary, he fathered five children:  Sarah, Mary, Josephine, Percival, and Edward.

==The day of the assassination==
[[File:Booth escape route.png|thumb|300px|right|Booth's escape route.  Pumphrey's horse was killed by Herold while he and Booth were hiding in the woods prior to crossing the [[Potomac River]] into [[Virginia]].]]
Pumphrey was an acquaintance of conspirator [[John Surratt]] and it was Surratt who introduced Booth to him prior to the assassination.  Pumphrey's stable was located near the [[National Hotel (Washington, D.C.)|National Hotel]], which was Booth's Washington residence at the time. Booth had been hiring one particular horse, which he preferred, from Pumphrey.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman. ''American Brutus''. Pp. 176, 208&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 1865, after learning that Lincoln would attend that evening's performance of the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'',  Booth went directly from [[Ford's Theatre]] to Pumphrey's livery stable to make arrangements for procuring a horse.&lt;ref&gt;Kunhardt, ''Twenty Days'', pg. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Pumphrey informed Booth that the horse he usually hired was unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman ''American Brutus''. Pp. 208, 220&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Booth hired a different one, a swift little [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[mare]] with a white star on her forehead and a black tail and mane.&lt;ref&gt;Kunhardt, ''Twenty Days'', pg. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
Booth told Pumphrey that he would be back to get it at around four o'clock that afternoon.

At the hour agreed upon, Booth arrived at the stable. Pumphrey warned Booth that the horse was high spirited and she would break her halter if left unattended.&lt;ref&gt;Kunhardt, ''Twenty Days'', pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Booth mentioned to Pumphrey that he was going to Grover's Theatre, the former name of the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]], as he had to write an important letter.  He added that he planned afterwards to stop for a drink and then take a leisurely ride.&lt;ref&gt;Kunhardt, ''Twenty Days'', pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  Booth did write a letter, but not at Grover's Theatre.  He wrote the letter at the National Hotel; it was written to the editor of a Washington D.C. newspaper called the ''National Intelligencer''. In the letter, he explained that his plans had changed from kidnapping Lincoln to assassinating him. In addition to signing his own name, he also added those of his co-conspirators: [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Lewis Powell]], [[George Atzerodt]], and [[David Herold]]. Later, Booth did get a drink at [[Peter Taltavull]]'s Star Saloon located next to Ford's Theatre, but he definitely did not go on a pleasure ride. Instead, Booth approached [[Edmund Spangler]], an acquaintance and stage hand at Ford's Theatre, with the request to hold the reins of the skittish mare that he hired, while he briefly attended to some business within the theater. This business was murdering Lincoln.

After the assassination, Booth and Herold made good an escape to Virginia.  Prior to crossing the Potomac River and while hiding out in some woods, Herold killed Pumphrey's horse along with his own because the horses were no longer needed.

==Temporary imprisonment==
In the turmoil that followed Lincoln's assassination, scores of suspected accomplices were arrested and thrown into prison by the [[United States Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]].  Stanton vigorously pursued the apprehension and prosecution of the conspirators involved in Lincoln's assassination.  All the people who were discovered to have had anything to do with the assassination or anyone with the slightest contact with Booth or Herold on their flight were put behind bars.  Pumphrey, having supplied the get away horse, was jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Kunhardt, ''Twenty Days'', pg. 187&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, the suspects were narrowed down to a group of eight prisoners—seven men and one woman—and, along with many others, Pumphrey was released.&lt;ref&gt;Kunhardt, ''Twenty Days'', pg. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 1865, Pumphrey testified for the Prosecution and described the horse he provided to Booth and the details of how that transaction came about.

Pumphrey's last part in the events surrounding the assassination was to wait mounted on his horse for hours outside the [[Fort Lesley J. McNair|Old Arsenal Penitentiary]].  He waited in the hope of having the privilege of carrying President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s reprieve to [[Mary Surratt]].  While Pumphrey regarded Mrs. Surratt as wholly innocent and exhibited the deepest sympathy for her, no reprieve was to come.  On July 7, 1865, she was hanged with three of the other conspirators.

==Later life and death==
Pumphrey continued to operate the livery stable until some time after 1900.  The demise of his stable, like many others of the day, was caused by the advent of the automobile.  On 16 March 1906, Pumphrey died in Washington, DC.  He is buried in [[Congressional Cemetery]].

===Obituary===

The following is Pumphrey's obituary in [[Washington Star|''The Evening Star'']], Washington, DC. It is from page 9 of the issue dated 16 March 1906:

{{quote|James W. Pumphrey, long a prominent and active businessman of Washington, died this morning at 8:50 o'clock at his residence 477 C Street after a short illness. Mr. Pumphrey was a native of Washington, born here September 12, 1832, and lived here all his life. He was connected with the livery business for many years and an important incident in his career for which he was in no way responsible, was the circumstance that from his stables on C Street, N.W., John Wilkes Booth rented a horse prior to the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln and on which he afterward escaped into [[Maryland]] where he met his death. The spurs which John Wilkes Booth wore on this expedition were borrowed from Mr. Pumphrey, although the latter had no knowledge of the purpose for which the assassin intended to employ them. For some time after this tragic event, Mr. Pumphrey was under surveillance and was not relieved until after the trial and conviction of the parties who were accused of association with John Wilkes Booth in the assassination. At the end of these trying times, Mr. Pumphrey who had already been acquitted by the courts was also acquitted in popular estimation and continued for many years in his original business. He was active, energetic and very charitable in each and every walk of life. He had during life many friends which he continued to hold until his end.

While Mr. Pumphrey was identified in a striking manner with the great closing tragedy of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he always held, and his views were believed, that the idea of assassination arose in the mind of Booth alone, and that all of the others who were accused of participation in that sad event were influenced by that peculiar and erratic character. He exhibited the deepest sympathy for [[Mary Surratt|Mrs. Surratt]] whom he regarded as wholly innocent of participation and it is said he sat mounted on his horse for hours waiting in the hope of having the privilege of carrying President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s reprieve to Mrs. Surratt then imprisoned and afterward executed at the arsenal in this city.

Mr. Pumphrey often told his friends that his only connection with the Lincoln conspiracy was that he lost his horse. Booth had taken from the Pumphrey Stables the horse which was afterward killed by Herold, Booth's companion after escaping into Maryland to avoid detection and capture. Mr. Pumphrey was for some time under arrest, in common with almost everybody that knew anything about or had any possible connection with this incident of American history but as stated he was at the time and has since been absolved of all connection with that lamentable affair.}}

A '''list of antibiotic resistant bacteria''' is provided below. These bacteria have shown antibiotic resistance (or [[antimicrobial resistance]]).

== Enzyme NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) ==
{{Main|New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1}}
[[New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1|NDM-1]] is an [[enzyme]] that makes [[bacteria]] resistant to a broad range of [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s.

NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) originated in India. In Indian hospitals [[hospital-acquired infection]]s are common and with the new super-bugs on rise in India, this can make them dangerous.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Timothy R|last2=Weeks|first2=Janis|last3=Livermore|first3=David M|last4=Toleman|first4=Mark A|title=Dissemination of NDM-1 positive bacteria in the New Delhi environment and its implications for human health: an environmental point prevalence study |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473309911700597|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=11|issue=5|pages=355–362|doi=10.1016/s1473-3099(11)70059-7|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mapping of sewage and water supply samples that were NDM-1-positive indicates widespread infection in New Delhi already back in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Infections are most frequent in people who have had recent medical and/or antibiotic treatment. ''C. difficile'' infections commonly occur during hospitalization.&lt;ref name="CDC2013"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html|title=Biggest Threats – Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance – CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2015 CDC report, ''C. difficile'' caused almost 500,000 infections in the United States over a year period. Associated with these infections were an estimated 15,000 deaths. The CDC estimates that ''C. difficile'' infection costs could amount to $3.8 billion over a 5-year span.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0225-clostridium-difficile.html|title=CDC Press Releases|website=CDC|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests the overuse of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as ''C. difficile''.[16]

Antibiotics, especially those with a broad activity spectrum (such as clindamycin) disrupt normal intestinal flora. This can lead to an overgrowth of ''C. difficile'', which flourishes under these conditions. Pseudomembranous colitis can follow, creating generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of "pseudomembrane", a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.[4] [[Clindamycin]]-resistant ''C. difficile'' was reported as the causative agent of large outbreaks of diarrheal disease in hospitals in New York, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts between 1989 and 1992.&lt;ref name="Johnson1999"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson S, Samore MH, Farrow KA, Killgore GE, Tenover FC, Lyras D, Rood JI, DeGirolami P, Baltch AL, Rafferty ME, Pear SM, Gerding DN|year=1999|title=Epidemics of diarrhea caused by a clindamycin-resistant strain of ''Clostridium difficile'' in four hospitals|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=341|issue=23|pages=1645–1651|doi=10.1056/NEJM199911253412203|pmid=10572152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically dispersed outbreaks of ''C. difficile'' strains resistant to [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, were also reported in North America in 2005.&lt;ref name="Loo_2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Loo VG, Poirier L, Miller MA, Oughton M, Libman MD, Michaud S, Bourgault AM, Nguyen T, Frenette C, Kelly M, Vibien A, Brassard P, Fenn S, Dewar K, Hudson TJ, Horn R, René P, Monczak Y, Dascal A|year=2005|title=A predominantly clonal multi-institutional outbreak of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality|journal=N Engl J Med|volume=353|issue=23|pages=2442–9|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa051639|pmid=16322602|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''===
{{Main|Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis}}
[[Tuberculosis]] (TB) resistant to antibiotics is called [[Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis|MDR TB]] (multidrug-resistant TB). Globally, MDR TB causes 150,000 deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/antimicrobial-resistance-still-poses-public-health-threat|title=Antimicrobial Resistance Still Poses a Public Health Threat: A Conversation With Edward J. Septimus, MD, FIDSA, FACP, FSHEA, Clinical Professor of Internal Medicine at Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center|date=2013-04-17|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has contributed to this.&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author=LoBue P|year=2009|title=Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis|journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases|volume=22|issue=2|pages=167–73|doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e3283229fab|pmid=19283912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an obligate pathogen that has evolved to ensure its persistence in human populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Co-evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Homo sapiens, Brites, D., &amp; Gagneux, S. (2015).|date=2013-04-17|pmc=4339235 | pmid=25703549|doi=10.1111/imr.12264|volume=264|journal=Immunol Rev|pages=6–24 | last1 = Brites | first1 = D | last2 = Gagneux | first2 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident in the fact that Mycobacterium tuberculosis must cause a pulmonary disease in order to be successfully transmitted from one person to another. Tuberculosis better known as TB has one of the highest mortality rates among pathogens in the world. Mortality rates have not seen a significant decrease due to its growing resistance to certain antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/antimicrobial-resistance-still-poses-public-health-threat|title=Antimicrobial Resistance Still Poses a Public Health Threat: A Conversation With Edward J. Septimus, MD, FIDSA, FACP, FSHEA, Clinical Professor of Internal Medicine at Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center|date=2013-04-17|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is years worth of research and many work hours that have been devoted to the creation of a vaccine, one still does not exist. TB has a very high level of virulence which is mainly due in part to the fact it is extremely transmissible. TB was considered one of the most prevalent diseases, and did not have a cure until the discovery of [[streptomycin]] by [[Selman Waksman]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Herzog H|year=1998|title=History of Tuberculosis|journal=Respiration|volume=65|issue=1|pages=5–15|doi=10.1159/000029220|pmid=9523361}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bacteria soon developed resistance. Since then, drugs such as [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampin]] have been used. ''M. tuberculosis'' develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. These types of mutations can lead to genotype and phenotype changes that can contribute to reproductive success therefore they can be passed on and evolve into resistant bacteria. Resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug. [[Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis|Extensively drug-resistant TB]] (XDR TB) is TB that is also resistant to the second line of drugs.&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gao|first1=Qian|last2=Li|first2=Xia|year=2010|title=Transmission of MDR tuberculosis|journal=Drug Discovery Today: Disease Mechanisms|volume=7|pages=e61|doi=10.1016/j.ddmec.2010.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' to [[isoniazid]], [[rifampin]], and other common treatments has become an increasingly relevant clinical challenge. Evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have plasmids.&lt;ref name="pmid2115217"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zainuddin ZF, Dale JW|year=1990|title=Does Mycobacterium tuberculosis have plasmids?|journal=Tubercle|volume=71|issue=1|pages=43–9|doi=10.1016/0041-3879(90)90060-l|pmid=2115217}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''M. tuberculosis'' lack the opportunity to interact with other bacteria in order to share plasmids.&lt;ref name="pmid2115217" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Louw GE, Warren RM, Gey van Pittius NC, McEvoy CR, Van Helden PD, Victor TC|year=2009|title=A Balancing Act: Efflux/Influx in Mycobacterial Drug Resistance|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|volume=53|issue=8|pages=3181–9|doi=10.1128/AAC.01577-08|pmc=2715638|pmid=19451293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mycoplasma genitalium''===
''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' is a small pathogenic bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. It is still controversial whether or not this bacterium is to be recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen. Infection with ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' sometimes produces clinical symptoms, or a combination of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the [[urethra]] ([[urethritis]]) both in men and women, which is associated with [[mucopurulent discharge]] in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating.

Treatment of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to rapidly developing multi-drug resistance, and diagnosis and treatment is further hampered by the fact that ''M. genitalium'' infections are not routinely detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suneta|first1=Soni|last2=Parkhouse|first2=Andy|last3=Gillian|first3=Dean|date=24 April 2017|title=Macrolide and quinolone-resistant ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' in a man with persistent urethritis: the tip of the British iceberg?|url=http://sti.bmj.com/content/early/2017/04/24/sextrans-2016-053077|deadurl=no|journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections|pages=sextrans-2016-053077|doi=10.1136/sextrans-2016-053077|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azithromycin]] is the most common first-line treatment, but the commonly-used 1 gram single-dose azithromycin treatment can lead to the bacteria commonly developing resistance to azithromycin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yew|first1=H.

However, resistance against moxifloxacin has been observed since 2007, thought to be due to ''parC'' [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]].&lt;ref name="Jorgen S 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlineclinic.co.uk/news/2012/12/20/MycoplasmaGenitaliumTreatmentChoices.aspx|title=Mycoplasma Genitalium Treatment Choices|website=www.theonlineclinic.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tetracyclines]], including [[doxycycline]], have a low clinical eradication rate for ''M. genitalium'' infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=J.S.|last2=Cusini|first2=M.|last3=Gomberg|first3=M.|last4=Moi|first4=M.|date=9 August 2016|title=2016 European guideline on ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' infections|journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology|volume=30|issue=10|pages=1650–1656|doi=10.1111/jdv.13849|pmid=27505296|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few cases have been described where doxycycline, azithromycin and moxifloxacin had all failed, but [[pristinamycin]] was still able to eradicate the infection.&lt;ref name="Jorgen S 2016" /&gt;

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
{{Main|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus}}

''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membrane]]s and the [[human skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by [[oxacillin]] because of significant kidney toxicity. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now "quite common" in hospitals{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of [[sepsis]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the [[United States|US]] are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

===''Streptococcus''  ===
''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (Group A ''Streptococcus'': GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Strains of ''S. pyogenes'' resistant to [[macrolide]] antibiotics have emerged; however, all strains remain uniformly susceptible to [[penicillin]].&lt;ref name="pmid15109426"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Albrich WC, Monnet DL, Harbarth S|year=2004|title=Antibiotic selection pressure and resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes|journal=Emerg.

Resistance of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization. ''S. pneumoniae'' is responsible for [[pneumonia]], [[bacteremia]], [[otitis media]], [[meningitis]], [[sinusitis]], [[peritonitis]] and [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name="pmid15109426" /&gt;

== Gram negative ==

===''Campylobacter''===
''[[Campylobacter]]'' causes diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and abdominal cramps. Serious complications such as temporary paralysis can also occur. Physicians rely on [[ciprofloxacin]] and [[azithromycin]] for treating patients with severe disease although ''Campylobacter'' is showing resistance to these antibiotics.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

===''Neisseria gonorrhoeae''===
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea}}
[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae|''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'']] is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes [[gonorrhea]], a sexually transmitted disease that can result in discharge and inflammation at the urethra, cervix, pharynx, or rectum.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt; It can cause pelvic pain, pain on urination, penile and vaginal discharge, as well as systemic symptoms. It can also cause severe reproductive complications.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

=== Gamma proteobacteria ===

==== Enterobacteriaceae ====
As of 2013 hard-to-treat or untreatable infections of [[Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae|carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae]] (CRE), also known as carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), were increasing among patients in medical facilities. CRE are resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. Almost half of hospital patients who get bloodstream CRE infections die from the infection.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

=====''Klebsiella pneumoniae''=====
Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase ([[Beta-lactamase#KPC (K. pneumoniae carbapenemase) (Class A)|KPC]])-producing bacteria are a group of emerging highly drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli causing infections associated with significant morbidity and mortality whose incidence is rapidly increasing in a variety of clinical settings around the world. ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' includes numerous mechanisms for antibiotic resistance, many of which are located on highly mobile genetic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hudson|first1=Corey|last2=Bent|first2=Zachary|last3=Meagher|first3=Robert|last4=Williams|first4=Kelly|date=June 7, 2014|title=Resistance Determinants and Mobile Genetic Elements of an NDM-1-Encoding Klebsiella pneumoniae Strain|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0099209|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=6|pages=e99209|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0099209|pmc=4048246|pmid=24905728}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbapenem]] antibiotics (heretofore often the treatment of last resort for resistant infections) are generally not effective against KPC-producing organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Arnold RS, Thom KA, Sharma S, Phillips M, Kristie Johnson J, Morgan DJ|year=2011|title=Emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase-Producing Bacteria|journal=Southern Medical Journal|volume=104|issue=1|pages=40–5|doi=10.1097/SMJ.0b013e3181fd7d5a|pmc=3075864|pmid=21119555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Salmonella'' and ''E. coli''=====
Infection with ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' can result from the consumption of contaminated food and [[Water pollution|polluted water]]. Both of these bacteria are well known for causing nosocomial (hospital-linked) infections, and often, these strains found in hospitals are antibiotic resistant because of adaptations to wide spread antibiotic use.&lt;ref name="Davies2010"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Davies J, Davies D|year=2010|title=Origins and Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance|journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev|volume=74|issue=3|pages=417–433|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00016-10|pmc=2937522|pmid=20805405|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; When both bacteria are spread, serious health conditions arise. Many people are hospitalized each year after becoming infected, with some dying as a result. Since 1993, some strains of ''E. coli'' have become resistant to multiple types of [[quinolone antibiotic|fluoroquinolone antibiotics]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Although mutation alone plays a huge role in the development of antibiotic resistance, a 2008 study found that high survival rates after exposure to antibiotics could not be accounted for by mutation alone.&lt;ref name="Adam2008"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Adam M, Murali B, Glenn NO, Potter SS|year=2008|title=Epigenetic inheritance based evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria|journal=BMC Evol. Biol.|volume=8|issue=|pages=52|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-8-52|pmc=2262874|pmid=18282299}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study focused on the development of resistance in ''E. coli'' to three antibiotic drugs: ampicillin, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid. The researchers found that some antibiotic resistance in ''E. coli'' developed because of epigenetic inheritance rather than by direct inheritance of a mutated gene. This was further supported by data showing that reversion to antibiotic sensitivity was relatively common as well. This could only be explained by epigenetics.&lt;ref name="Adam2008" /&gt; [[Epigenetics]] is a type of inheritance in which gene expression is altered rather than the genetic code itself. There are many modes by which this alteration of gene expression can occur, including [[DNA methylation|methylation of DNA]] and [[histone]] modification; however, the important point is that both inheritance of random mutations and epigenetic markers can result in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.&lt;ref name="Adam2008" /&gt;

Resistance to [[polymyxins]] first appear in 2011.&lt;ref name="Nature2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reardon|first1=Sara|date=21 December 2015|title=Spread of antibiotic-resistance gene does not spell bacterial apocalypse — yet|url=http://www.nature.com/news/spread-of-antibiotic-resistance-gene-does-not-spell-bacterial-apocalypse-yet-1.19037|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2015.19037}}&lt;/ref&gt; An easier way for this resistance to spread, a [[plasmid]] known as [[MCR-1]] was discovered in 2015.&lt;ref name="Nature2015" /&gt;

==== Pseudomonadales ====

====''Acinetobacter''====
''[[Acinetobacter]]'' is a gram-negative bacteria that causes pneumonia or bloodstream infections in critically ill patients. [[Acinetobacter#Treatment|Multidrug-resistant ''Acinetobacter'']] have become very resistant to antibiotics.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

On November 5, 2004, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported an increasing number of ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'' bloodstream infections in patients at military medical facilities in which service members injured in the [[Iraq]]/[[Kuwait]] region during [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and in [[Afghanistan]] during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] were treated. Most of these showed [[multidrug resistance]] (MRAB), with a few isolates resistant to all drugs tested.&lt;ref name="pmid15549020"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Centers for Disease Control Prevention (CDC).|year=2004|title=Acinetobacter baumannii infections among patients at military medical facilities treating injured U.S. service members, 2002–2004|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5345a1.htm|journal=MMWR Morb.

=====''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''=====
''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is a highly prevalent [[opportunistic pathogen]]. One of the most worrisome characteristics of ''P. aeruginosa'' is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of [[efflux (microbiology)|multidrug efflux pumps]] with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., ''mexAB-oprM'', ''mexXY'') and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes.&lt;ref name="Poole2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poole K |title=Efflux-mediated multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=12–26 |year=2004 |pmid=14706082 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.00763.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''P. aeruginosa'' has the ability to produce 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) and it has been found that HAQs have prooxidant effects, and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics. The study experimented with the ''P. aeruginosa'' [[biofilms]] and found that a disruption of relA and spoT genes produced an inactivation of the Stringent response (SR) in cells with nutrient limitation, which provides cells be more susceptible to antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nguyen D, Joshi-Datar A, Lepine F, Bauerle E, Olakanmi O, Beer K, McKay G, Siehnel R, Schafhauser J, Wang Y, Britigan BE, Singh PK |title=Active Starvation Responses Mediate Antibiotic Tolerance in Biofilms and Nutrient-Limited Bacteria |journal=Science |volume=334 |issue=6058 |pages=982–6 |year=2011 |pmid=22096200 |doi=10.1126/science.1211037 |bibcode=2011Sci...334..982N |pmc=4046891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="132488">There have been many thousands of [[friendly fire]] incidents in recorded military history, accounting for an estimated 2% to 20% of all casualties in battle.&lt;ref name="Percin"&gt;{{fr icon}} Percin, Gen. Alexandre (1921) ''Le Massacre de Notre Infanterie 1914–1918'', Michel Albin, Paris; Percin supported his claims using hundreds of items of correspondence from officers and aliens who had served in the French Army in WW1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shrader"&gt;Shrader, Charles R. (1982) ''Amicicide: The Problem of Friendly Fire in Modern War'', US Command &amp; General Staff College Survey No.1&lt;/ref&gt;  The examples listed below illustrate their range and diversity, but this does not reflect increasing frequency. The ''rate'' of friendly fire, once allowance has been made for the numbers of troops committed to battle, has remained remarkably stable over the past 200 years.&lt;ref name="Kirke"&gt;Kirke, Charles M.

==Wars of the Roses==
*1471 – During the [[Battle of Barnet]] a Lancastrian force under the [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]] was fired on by the Lancastrian centre while returning from a pursuit; their banner, Oxford's “[[Star (heraldry)|star with rays]]” had been mistaken for the Yorkist “[[sun in splendour]]”. This gave rise to cries of treachery, (always a possibility in that chaotic period), Lancastrian morale collapsed, and the battle was lost.

==English Civil War==
*1643 – Following fall of [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire]] to [[Roundhead]] forces, captured Royalist commander, the [[Robert Pierrepont, 1st Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull|Earl of Kingston]], was killed by Royalist cannon fire when the boat transporting him to Hull was fired on from the banks of the River Trent.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 44|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=264|isbn=0-19-861394-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nine Years' War==
*1690 – Two French regiments accidentally attacking each other during the [[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Battle of Fleurus]] led to the practice of attaching a white scarf to the flags of the regiments.&lt;ref&gt;Mouillard, Lucien – ''Les régiments sous Louis XV'', 1882. [http://pfef.free.fr/Anc_Reg/Unif_Org/Mouillard/mouillard_L1c01.htm Book 1, Chapter 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==French and Indian War==
*July 9, 1755 – Two main phases of friendly fire occurred during the [[Battle of the Monongahela]], which halted the [[Braddock Expedition]] of British regular ('redcoat') and British American colonial troops after a combined force of [[Troupes de la marine|French regulars]], French-Canadian militia and allied Native Americans joined battle with them before [[Fort Duquesne]].  In the obscuring woodland conditions and confusion caused by the French musket fire and the Native Americans' war cries, several redcoat platoons fired at each other.  Later in the battle many American colonials, lacking the redcoats' training in standing their ground, fled from more exposed ground and into woods, where redcoats fired on them mistaking them for advancing French fighters.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite book|title=Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and The Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766|last=Anderson|first=Fred|year=2000|publisher=Alfred Knopf, New York|page=102|isbn=0-375-40642-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Revolutionary War==
*In the [[Battle of Germantown]] in 1777, a combination of late arrival, poor navigation and overpursuit resulted in [[Major General]] [[Adam Stephen]]'s men colliding with General [[Anthony Wayne]]'s troops. The two American brigades opened fire on each other, became badly disorganized, and fled.
*In the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]] on March 15, 1781, after several volleys of musket and cannon fire between American and British troops, smoke began to obscure soldiers' view of the battlefield. In a pitched battle, smoke not only limited visibility but irritated soldiers' eyes and could make breathing difficult. In the confusion, British Lieutenant John Macleod, in command of two British three-pounders, was directed by British [[Lieutenant General]] [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] to fire on the Americans and the British alike. Many British soldiers died as a result of friendly artillery [[bombardment]].

==Napoleonic Wars==
*1796 – [[Battle of Fombio]]: In a night of confused fighting when Austrian units had stumbled into his army's position, French general [[Amédée Emmanuel François Laharpe|Amadee Laharpe]] was shot dead by his own men while returning from [[reconnaissance]].
*1801 – [[Battle of Algeciras Bay]]: Spanish ships ''Real Carlos'' and ''San Hermenegildo'' mistakenly engaged each other in the dark after a British ship sailed between them and fired at both. 1,700 were killed when the two ships exploded.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
* 1806 – On 30 November, at 10pm, {{HMS|Dart|1796|6}} and {{HMS|Wolverine|1805|2}} came upon a ship that they suspected was a French privateer and that kept up a running fight until morning, only surrendering after her captain and several of her crew had been wounded, of whom six later died. The vessel turned out to be the British merchant ship {{ship||Mary|1806 ship|2}}.&lt;ref name=Clowes&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iH9nAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA394&amp;dq=Wolverine+Collier&amp;num=100&amp;ei=iJNTS9aLGZC8yQSS2cT5Cw&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=79#v=onepage&amp;q=Wolverine%20Collier&amp;f=false Clowes (1897–1903), pp.394–5]&lt;/ref&gt;
*1809 – [[Battle of Wagram]]: French troops mistakenly fired on their allies from the [[Kingdom of Saxony]]. The grey uniforms of the Saxons were misidentified as white, the colour of uniform worn by their Austrian enemy.
*1815 – 
:*[[Battle of Quatre Bras]]: Soldiers of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] 3rd Light Cavalry Brigade disengaging and retiring from a skirmish against the French were fired on by Scottish infantry of the British army who mistook their uniforms for those of French ''[[chasseurs a cheval]]''.&lt;ref name=napoleonistyka-HW&gt;{{harvnb|Anonymous|2013}} Section "French lancers created havoc." cites Hamilton-Williams as a source but does not give the book.&lt;/ref&gt;
:*[[Battle of Waterloo]]: [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] artillery mistakenly fired on British artillery causing many casualties, and British artillery returned fire at the Prussians.

==Texas Revolution==
*Both sides, [[Texians]] and Mexicans, in the [[Siege of the Alamo]] in 1836, had friendly fire incidents:
:*In early hours of 1 March, a mounted party of Texian volunteers arriving at gallop to reinforce the Alamo garrison were fired at by defenders who mistook them in the dark for attacking Mexican horsemen, wounding one of them, before the sentries were called to open the gates for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alamo Story: From Early History to Current Conflicts|last=Edmondson|first=J.R.|year=2000|publisher=Republic of Texas Press|page=340|isbn=1-55622-678-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*At the Mexicans' final mass assault (overnight 5-6 March), some of the veteran troops leading it were wounded or killed when shot by untrained recruits in the ranks behind who "blindly fir[ed] their guns", and when all the defenders had been killed, Mexicans continued to shoot Mexicans in mistake during the darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1836 Facts About The Alamo And The Texas War For Independence|last=Petite|first=Mary Deborah|year=1999|publisher=Savas Publishing Co|page=114|isbn=1-882810-35-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Civil War==
*During the [[Battle of Sharpsburg]] on 17 September 1862, a Confederate regiment had maneuvered into a gap between two Union regiments, the [[9th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|9th New York]] and the 5th Massachusetts. The Confederates launched a surprise attack during a Union advance into the west woods. The 9th New York hastily began returning fire and unknowingly hit the 5th Massachusetts with musket fire that overshot the Confederate regiment, causing the other Union regiment to return fire in confusion. The two Union regiments had sustained heavy casualties during the lengthy exchange of fire. This was one of eleven friendly fire events recorded at Antietam, which taken together, were thought to have accounted for 1,150 killed and wounded, or approximately 5% of the total casualties.&lt;ref name="Garrison"&gt;Garrison, Webb B. (1999) ''Friendly Fire in the Civil War: More than 100 True Stories of Comrade Killing Comrade'', Rutledge Hill Press; {{ISBN|1-55853-714-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Confederate Lieutenant General [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson]] was wounded as a result of friendly fire in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] on 2 May 1863, and died eight days later. He and some of his men had been returning, under the cover of night, from an intelligence-gathering mission when Confederate troops of the [[18th North Carolina Infantry]] misidentified them as a Union cavalry scout team; as a result, the North Carolina troops opened fire.&lt;ref name="Garrison"/&gt;
*In the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] on 6 May 1864, Confederate Lt. General [[James Longstreet]] was wounded when his mounted column was mistaken for Federal troops. As a result of this, he did not return to command until October of that year. In the same incident, Brigadier General [[Micah Jenkins]] was mortally wounded after being struck in the head.&lt;ref name="Garrison"/&gt;
*In the early hours of 6 March 1865, the Union vessel [[USS Peterhoff (1863)|USS ''Peterhoff'']] was en route to blockade [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] when she was rammed and sunk by the [[USS Monticello (1859)|''Monticello'']] after being mistaken for a blockade runner. All hands were rescued before she sank.

==Russo-Japanese War==

One vessel was sunk, four were damaged, and two fishermen were killed and six wounded. In the general chaos that ensued, the cruisers [[Russian cruiser Aurora|''Aurora'']] and [[Russian armoured cruiser Dmitrii Donskoi|''Dmitrii Donskoi'']] were also taken for Japanese warships in the fog and bombarded by seven battleships sailing in formation, damaging both ships and killing at least one Russian sailor and severely wounding another, and fatally wounding a naval chaplain. During the pandemonium, several Russian ships signalled that torpedoes had hit them, and on board the battleship [[Russian battleship Borodino|''Borodino'']], rumours spread that the ship was being boarded by the Japanese, with some crew members donning life vests and lying prone on the deck and others drawing cutlasses to repel a boarding before a ceasefire was signalled.

==World War I==
*[[Battle of Dinant]] 21–23 August 1914 – It is believed that some parties of German infantry entering the Belgian city of Dinant in a nighttime assault, fired at each other in the darkness of the night while under fire from French troops. The Germans mistakenly believed that hostile Belgian civilians had fired on them, contributing to a conviction among the German soldiers that Belgian civilians were actively fighting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horne, Kramer|first=J.N., A.|title=German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial|year=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|page=46|isbn=0-30008-975-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to later arrests and massacres of local civilians when the town was invested and occupied.  On the 23rd German artillery mistakenly fired on infantry who were occupying and barricading a street; the latter units were temporarily forced to withdraw, having shot a man held as human shield accused of having been a franc-tireur in earlier fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Battle of Bolimow]] 31 January 1915 – The German [[9th Army (German Empire)|Ninth Army]] launched the first large scale poison [[tear gas]] attack on the [[Russian Second Army]] in Poland, firing 18,000 gas shells. However the wind blew the gas back onto the German lines, causing a few casualties which could have been higher had the winter cold not frozen the ingredient [[xylyl bromide]]. The attack was called off, the counter-attacking Russians being successfully repelled by conventional artillery shellfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/The|title=Battle of Bolimow 1915|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*25 September 1915 – In the first gas attack launched by British forces prior to their infantry attack that opened the [[Battle of Loos]], about {{convert|140|LT|kg}} of [[chlorine]] gas was released, aimed at the German lines but in places the gas was blown back by wind onto British trenches. Due to the inefficiency of the contemporary gas masks, many soldiers removed them as they could not see through the fogged-up talc eyepieces or could barely breathe with them on. This led to some British soldiers being affected by their own gas, as it blew back across their lines or lingered in [[no man's land]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Richard|title=The Little Field Marshal, A Life of Sir John French|year=1981|publisher=Cassell Military Paperbacks, 2005 edition|pp=302–305|isbn=978-0-304-36702-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; immediately causing the death of 10 and injury to about 2,000 British soldiers.

*8 May 1916 – During the [[Battle of Verdun]], when the French outpost [[Fort Douaumont]] was temporarily occupied by German infantry, a careless cooking fire detonated grenades, flamethrower fuel and an ammunition cache. Hundreds of soldiers were killed instantly in the firestorm, including the entire 12th Grenadiers regimental staff. Worse, some of the 1,800 wounded and soot blackened survivors attempting to escape the inferno were mistaken for attacking French Colonial African infantry and were fired upon by their comrades. In all 679 German soldiers perished in this fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Battle so bloody men called it The Meat Grinder|work=Daily Mail|date=20 May 2016|page=57}}Centenary article by Tony Rennell.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On the opening of the [[Battle of Mount Sorrel]] in the [[Ypres Salient]] of [[Belgium]], the commanding officer of the [[3rd Canadian Division]], [[Malcolm Mercer|Major General Malcolm Mercer]], and his aide Captain Lynam Gooderham, were wounded and trapped when German artillery opened fire on divisional trenches they were inspecting on 2 June 1916.  They ran into rifle crossfire when attempting to evade advancing German infantry, Mercer receiving a bullet in a leg, then remained overnight unhelped until 2 am next day when Mercer was killed by an exploding shell and Gooderham was taken prisoner by the Germans.  A staff officer later claimed the fatal shell was British and Mercer is upheld as the most senior [[Canadian Army|Canadian]] officer killed in combat and by friendly fire.&lt;ref name=cmj&gt;{{cite journal|title=Major General Malcolm Smith Mercer: The highest ranking Canadian officer killed in the Great War by friendly fire.|journal=[[Canadian Military Journal]]|date=Spring 2007}}Article by Gordon MacKinnon.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On the night of 4–5 August 1916, during the [[First Battle of the Somme]], the 13th Battalion of the [[Durham Light Infantry]] were fired on by Australian Artillery while in process of capturing and holding onto a German communication trench called Munster Alley.
*17 September 1916 – During the same Battle of the Somme, a company of the 1st/7th Battalion of the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]] waiting to charge a German trench south of [[Thiepval]], France, were strafed from behind by British [[Stokes mortar]] fire, the most loss of life caused when their hand grenade store was hit, detonating its contents.  The mortars had been issued their battalion only a few weeks before and inexperienced firers had set too short a range aiming at enemy lines. Despite this, company commander Captain Basil Lupton rallied the survivors and led a successful taking of the opposite trench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

*24/25 April 1918 – During the [[Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux]], soldiers of the Australian 50th Infantry Battalion, advancing in the dark under German machine fire, attacked what they believed was an enemy trench. They found out that the trench was instead occupied by British troops of the 2nd [[Devonshire Regiment|Devon]] and 1st [[Worcestershire Regiment|Worcester]] Battalions who had not been informed of the Australian counterattack and "thought the Germans were attacking them from the rear".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Edwin Woodrow Bean, The Australian Imperial Force in France during the Main German Offensive, 1918 (Sydney, 1937), Volume V Chapter XVII p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the attack on the main wagon bridge over the [[Marne]] at [[Château-Thierry]], American machine gunners described a night attack on 1 June 1918 of massed German troops, who were singing gutturally as they made a suicidal charge, some linked arm in arm. The victims were soldiers of the French 10th Colonial division from [[Senegal]], who had been trying to get back across the river. Although reports of the incident were suppressed, it was discussed by American and French soldiers. There are no German records of any attack on the wagon bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MfSM14o6uqgC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=friendly+fire+'world+war+I'&amp;source=web&amp;ots=_7Ejhh1Ugv&amp;sig=V3pe3gjtPEoe689VukcBJN_aDwk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result |title=American Battlefields of World War I: Chateau-thierry – then And Now

*16 June 1918 – During [[Spring Offensive]], the British 4th Battalion of the [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] (4th KSLI), with reinforcing elements of [[North Staffordshire Regiment|North Staffordshires]] and [[Cheshire Regiment|Cheshires]], were shelled by British artillery who were unaware the position had changed hands, within 30 minutes of successfully taking a hill, Montagne de Bligny, from the Germans and capturing prisoners. The bombardment reduced the units' effective strength to 100 men but their commander, Captain Geoffrey Bright, insisted on retaining the hill and sending out for reinforcements from British units until help arrived before nightfall.  For the overall action the 4th KSLI received a unit award of the [[Croix de guerre 1914-1918 (France)|French Croix de Guerre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shropshireregimentalmuseum.co.uk/regimental-history/volunteers-territorial-and-militia/4th-territorial-battalion-ksli-bligny-and-the-croix-de-guerre] Article by Shropshire Regimental Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;
*13 July 1918 – British army officer and poet [[Siegfried Sassoon]] was wounded after being shot in the head by a fellow British soldier who had mistaken him for a German near [[Arras]], [[France]]. As a result, he spent the remainder of the war in Britain.
*16 July 1918 – British [[flying ace]] Major [[Awdry Vaucour]] was killed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1918/1918%20-%200890.html "Casualties" ''Flight'' 1918]&lt;/ref&gt; in the vicinity of [[Monastier di Treviso]], [[Italy]] when he was accidentally shot down by an Italian pilot.
*28 July 1918 – Canadian [[flying ace]] and future spymaster [[William Stephenson]], then posted with [[No. 73 Squadron RAF]], was shot down and crashed his [[Sopwith Camel]] [[biplane]] behind enemy lines in France.  During the incident, he later claimed, Stephenson was injured by fire not only from German ace pilot, [[Justus Grassmann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/canada/stephenson2.php|title=Retrieved on 19 September 2010|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also by [[friendly fire]] from a French observer.&lt;ref name="intrepid"&gt;

*4 October 1918 - The nine companies from the US Army's [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]] which had pushed into a salient at Charlevaux, France and became known as the "[[Lost Battalion (World War I)|Lost Battalion]]" after being surrounded by the Germans, were subjected to friendly artillery fire for several hours, either due to the artillery fire being inaccurate or the coordinates, delivered by carrier pigeon, being inaccurate. The overall commander, Major [[Charles White Whittlesey|Charles Whittlesey]], used his last carrier pigeon, named [[Cher Ami]], to send a second message for the artillery to cease fire.
*15 October 1918 – British submarine [[HMS J6]] was sunk by British [[Q-ship]] ''[[Cymric (schooner)|Cymric]]'' in the [[Northumberland Coast]]. ''Cymric''{{'}}s captain, Lieutenant F. Peterson [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNR]], mistook the identity lettering on the conning tower of ''J6'' for ''U6''.  Assuming ''U6'' to indicate a German U-boat, Peterson raised the [[White ensign]] and opened fire on ''J6''. After a number of direct hits, ''J6'' sank. It was only after the survivors were seen in the water that Peterson and the crew of ''Cymric'' realised their mistake and recovered the survivors. Of the crew of ''J6'', 15 were lost; a subsequent court of enquiry found that no action should be taken against Peterson.

==Latvian War of Independence==
*6 March 1919 - Colonel [[Oskars Kalpaks]] was killed in command of his 1st Latvian Independent Battalion, when his unit had a mistaken skirmish with a [[Freikorps in the Baltic|German Freikorps]] party near Airītes in [[Saldus District]]. Both parties were allied in a counterattack on the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] occupying [[Latvia]].

==Spanish Civil War==
*In 1937, the Nationalist [[Irish Brigade (Spanish Civil War)|Irish Brigade]] was fired upon by a [[Falangist]] unit, and the hour-long firefight resulted in 17 deaths. Neither unit had any battle experience.

*6 September – Just days after the start of the war, in what was dubbed the [[Battle of Barking Creek]], three RAF [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] from 74 Squadron shot down two [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] from the RAF's 56 Squadron, killing one of the pilots. One of the Spitfires was then shot down by British anti-aircraft artillery while returning to base.&lt;ref name="Bickers"&gt;Townshend Bickers, Richard L.

*10 September – The British submarine {{HMS|Triton|N15|6}} sank another British submarine, {{HMS|Oxley}}. After making challenges which went unanswered ''Triton'' assumed it must have located a German [[U-boat]] and fired two torpedoes. ''Oxley'' was the first [[Royal Navy]] vessel to be sunk and also the first vessel to be sunk by a British vessel in the war, killing 52 with only two survivors. Both vessels were patrolling off the coast of [[Norway]] (then neutral) at the time. The incident that led to the loss of Oxley was kept in secrecy until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

*5 January – While flying an [[Airspeed Oxford]] for the [[Air Transport Auxiliary|ATA]] from [[Blackpool International Airport|Blackpool]] to [[RAF Kidlington]] near [[Oxford]], [[Amy Johnson]] went off course in adverse weather conditions. Reportedly out of fuel, she bailed out as her aircraft crashed into the [[Thames Estuary]] but her body was never recovered. In 1999 it was reported that Tom Mitchell, at the time a [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] fighter pilot, claimed to have shot Johnson down when she twice failed to give the correct identification code during the flight. He said: "The reason Amy was shot down was because she gave the wrong colour of the day [a signal to identify aircraft known by all British forces] over radio." Mitchell explained how the aircraft was sighted and contacted by radio. A request was made for the signal. She gave the wrong one twice. "Sixteen rounds of shells were fired and the plane dived into the Thames Estuary. We all thought it was an enemy plane until the next day when we read the papers and discovered it was Amy. The officers told us never to tell anyone what happened."&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Alison. "I think I shot down Amy Johnson." ''The Scotsman'', 6 February 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Laconia incident]] – there were three elements of friendly fire:
:*The {{RMS|Laconia|1921|6}}, a British naval transport ship, sunk by {{GS|U-156}} in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off west Africa on 12 September, was carrying 1,793 Italian prisoners-of-war among its passengers, of whom 1,420 ultimately died.&lt;ref name=uboats.com&gt;[http://german-uboats.com/item34.htm The Laconia Incident] Various survivor accounts of the incident.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was then Germany's ally.
:*On 16 September, during the mass rescue of survivors by German vessels, a USAAF [[B-24]] bomber under orders attacked ''U-156'' despite the pilot having earlier received a signal conveyed by a [[RAF]] officer from the U-boat that indicated Allied passengers were on board, and the submarine bearing the Red Cross flag. This caused the U-boat to cast off its passengers in order to [[Crash dive]] to avoid destruction, and to abandon rescue attempts. (''U-156'' was wrongly reported sunk in the action.)
:*On 17 September, another u-boat involved in rescue, {{GS|U-506||2}}, carrying 151 survivors, was attacked by a USAAF [[B-25]] bomber, although it failed to disable the vessel.
*23 October – During the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|2nd Battle of El Alamein]], at 2140 hours under the cover of a barrage of 1000 guns, British infantry of the [[51st (Highland) Infantry Division]] advanced towards the enemy lines. However, they advanced too fast into the area of fire from British artillery, causing over 60 casualties.&lt;ref name="Bickers"/&gt;
*During the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|2nd Battle of El Alamein]], RAF fighters bombed British troops during a four-hour raid, causing 56 casualties. The British [[10th Royal Hussars]] were among the victims; they did not know the proper signals to call off their planes.&lt;ref name="Bickers"/&gt;
*26 October — During the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], the [[USS Porter (DD-356)]] was forced to be scuttled after an errant torpedo from a friendly [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] that had been damaged and forced to ditch nearby. Ironically, the torpedo came from the very aircraft that they were going to rescue. 
*British submarine [[HMS Unbeaten (N93)|HMS ''Unbeaten'']] completed [[Operation Bluestone]], landing an agent in Spain near [[Bayona]], then completed her patrol in the [[Bay of Biscay]] and was returning to the UK when she went missing.  It is believed that she was probably attacked and sunk in error by an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Wellington bomber]] of No. 172 Squadron, Coastal Command in the Bay of Biscay on 11 November 1942 .  She was lost with all hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnsubmus.co.uk/general/losses.htm Submarine losses 1904 to present day], RN Submarine Museum, Gosport&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the night attack of 12/13 November in the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], the already damaged [[light cruiser]] {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|6}} was fired on by the [[cruiser]] {{USS|San Francisco|CA-38|6}}, causing several deaths.
*20 November – Numerous Allied pilots reported being shot at by friendly naval forces during the Torch landings in North Africa. In one such incident, a 202 Squadron Catalina flying boat was shot down with the loss of all 10 aircrew.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.202-sqn-assoc.co.uk/files/friendly_fire.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*3 March – The German [[blockade runner]] and [[minelayer]] [[Doggerbank (ship)|''Doggerbank'']] was mistaken for a British freighter and sunk by the submarine {{GS|U-43|1939|2}} in the mid-Atlantic. (It was a British made merchant vessel that had been captured in 1941 and impressed into German service.) Of the 365 men on board (the greater part Allied prisoners-of-war), only one German crewman survived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/2707.html ''Doggerbank''] at uboat.net&lt;/ref&gt;
*9 May – The destroyers [[HMS Bicester (L34)|HMS ''Bicester'']] and [[HMS Oakley (L98)|HMS ''Oakley'']], on deployment in the Mediterranean found themselves under air attack by [[Spitfire|Spitfire aircraft]]; the ''Bicester'' sustained extensive damage from a near miss, with the bomb exploding alongside causing major flooding. The ''Bicester'' was taken in tow to [[Malta]] for temporary repairs, and required permanent repairs in the United Kingdom, which were carried out between August and September.
*[[Operation Chastise]]: On 16–17 May, nineteen [[RAF]] [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] bombers of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|No. 617 Squadron]] were dispatched to attack dams in [[Eder]], [[Möhne]] and [[Sorpe (Röhr)]] rivers near Germany, using a specially developed "[[bouncing bomb]]" invented and developed by [[Barnes Wallis]]. [[Möhne Reservoir|Möhne]] and [[Edersee Dam]]s were breached, causing catastrophic flooding of the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] valley and of villages in the [[Edertal|Eder valley]].

*[[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Omar Bradley]], commander of the [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]], recalled that his column was attacked by American [[North American A-36|A-36]]s in [[Sicily]]. The tanks lit yellow smoke flares to identify themselves to their own aircraft but the attacks continued, forcing the column to return fire which resulted in the downing of one aircraft. A parachuting pilot from the downed A-36 was brought before Bradley. 'You stupid sonofabitch!!' Bradley fumed. 'Didn't you see our yellow recognition signals!?' The pilot replied 'Oh, is that what that was?'.&lt;ref&gt;Hallion, Richard. ''Strike from the Sky: The History of Battlefield Air Attack, 1911–1945'', Smithsonian Institution Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;
*12 August – [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] Flight Sergeant [[Arthur Louis Aaron]] was fatally wounded when the [[Short Stirling]] bomber he piloted during an air raid on [[Turin]] was reportedly (according to his posthumous [[Victoria Cross]] citation) hit by machine gun fire from an enemy night fighter, which killed his navigator and wounded other crew members, although it is believed it may have been friendly fire from another Stirling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowyer|first=Michael J.F.|title=The Stirling Bomber|year=1980|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber Ltd|page=129|isbn=0-571-11101-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died, after successfully landing the plane in Algeria, nine hours later.

*During [[Operation Cottage]] after Allied forces occupied [[Kiska Island]], U.S. and Canadian forces mistook each other as Japanese and engaged each other in a deadly firefight. As a result, 28 Americans and 4 Canadians were killed with 50 more wounded. There were no Japanese troops on the island two weeks before U.S. and Canadian forces landed. Meanwhile, thinking they were engaging Americans, [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] battleships shelled and attempted to torpedo neighbouring Little Kiska Island where Japanese soldiers were waiting to embark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webber|first=Bert|title=Aleutian Headache|year=1993|publisher=Webb Research Group|pages=201–202|isbn=0-936738-69-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1944===
*28 January – 
:*A train carrying 800 Allied [[prisoners of war]] was bombed when it crossed a bridge on the Ponte Paglia in [[Allerona|Allerona, Italy]], approximately 400 British, U.S. and South African prisoners being killed. In anticipation of the Allied advance, the POWs had been evacuated from PG Campo 54 at Fara-in-Sabina outside of Rome, and were being transported to Germany in unmarked cattle cars. The POWs had been padlocked in the cars and were crossing the bridge when [[Martin B-26 Marauder|B-26s]] of the [[320th Air Expeditionary Wing|320th Bombardment Group]] arrived to blow up the bridge. The driver stopped the train on the span, leaving the prisoners locked inside to their fate. While many escaped, approximately 400 were killed, according to local records, and witness testimony. The mass graves were later destroyed by subsequent bombardments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bombedpowtrain.weebly.com/  The Bridge at Allerona.]  Retrieved 2 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Early in the morning a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[PT boat]] carrying [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] commander General [[Mark W. Clark|Mark Clark]] to the Anzio [[beachhead]], six days after the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]], was mistakenly fired on by sister U.S. naval vessels.

*15 February - During the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]], under orders from the Allied commander-in-chief, General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]] via General Mark Clark, air raided the hilltop [[Monte Cassino|Cassino abbey]] which was suspected to be used as a German observation post. It killed 230 Italian civilians, whose country by then was 'co-belligerent' with the Allies, who had sought shelter in the monastery but no Germans (whose troops subsequently occupied and made the evacuated ruins a stronghold).&lt;ref&gt;David Hapgood and David Richardson, ''Monte Cassino: The Story of the Most Controversial Battle of World War II'', page 211 (1984, 2002), Da Capo, Cambridge, Mass. {{ISBN|0-306-81121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bombs that fell short of site killed some Allied troops on ground below, while 16 bombs were mistakenly dropped at the Fifth Army headquarter compound 17 miles (27 km) away, exploding yards from General Clark's trailer while he was at his desk inside.&lt;ref&gt;Brigadier C.J.C.

*On the morning of 27 March, two US [[Motor Torpedo Boat]]s ([[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-121|PT-121]] and PT-353) were destroyed in error by [[P-40 Kittyhawk]]s of [[No. 78 Squadron RAAF]], along with an [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] [[Bristol Beaufighter]] of [[No. 30 Squadron RAAF]]. A second Beaufighter crew recognized the vessels as PTs and tried to stop the attack, but not before both boats exploded and sank off the coast of [[New Britain]]. Eight American sailors were killed, with 12 others wounded.  Survivors were rescued by [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-346|PT-346]], which itself became a friendly fire victim the following month.
*28 April – [[Exercise Tiger]], a nine-day rehearsal for the [[D-Day]] landings on [[Utah Beach]], was marred when troops landed at [[Slapton, Devon|Slapton Sands]] during a live firing exercise. American soldiers crossed into an area which was being shelled with [[live ammunition]] by the British [[heavy cruiser]] [[HMS Hawkins|HMS ''Hawkins'']]. One source put the number of deaths at 308 American soldiers, more than the casualties on Utah Beach during D-Day itself.
*29 April – US Navy ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-346|PT-346]]'' itself became the victim of friendly fire, when sent to the aid of ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-347|PT-347]]'', which had become stuck on a reef during a night patrol to intercept enemy barges and destroy shore installations off the coast of [[Rabaul]] in Lassul Bay, located off the northwest corner of [[New Britain Island]] in [[New Guinea]]. At 0700, ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-350|PT-350]]'' was attempting to dislodge ''PT-347'' from the reef, when two American Marine [[F4U Corsair|Corsair]] planes mistook the PT boats for [[Japan]]ese gunboats and attacked. Taking heavy fire from the planes, ''PT-350'' shot down one of the two attacking [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s, believing them to be [[A6M Zero]]s. With three dead and four wounded and serious mechanical problems, ''PT-350'' headed back to base. ''PT-347'' remained stuck on the reef. When ''PT-350'' could not be boarded because of extensive damage, ''PT-346'' headed out to ''PT-347'' to provide assistance. ''PT-346'' arrived at 1230, and at 1400 was still attempting to dislodge ''PT-347'' from the coral heads when planes appeared. The Corsair plane from the morning run brought back an entire squadron of 21 planes (four Corsairs, six [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]]s, four [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]] fighters, and eight [[Douglas SBD Dauntless]] [[dive bomber]]s). Recognizing the planes as American and thinking they were the air cover he had ordered, the squadron commander ordered the men to keep working; however, the planes attacked the two boats, still mistaking them for Japanese gunboats. ''PT-346'' did not respond defensively until it was too late, and took heavy casualties. The skipper of ''PT-347'', Lieutenant Williams, who had experienced the earlier attack, ordered his men into the water and to stay dispersed, but two men were killed and three wounded. ''PT-346'' and ''PT-347'' were completely destroyed by bombs, and the men were strafed in the water for approximately one hour.
* 5–6 June – Several [[RAF]] [[Avro Lancaster]]s attempting to bomb the German artillery battery at [[Merville-Franceville-Plage]] attacked instead friendly positions, killing 186 soldiers of the British [[Reconnaissance Corps]] and devastating the town. They also mistakenly bombed Drop Zone 'V ' of the [[6th Airborne Division]], killing 78 and injuring 65.&lt;ref&gt;''p.99, Bernage, Georges. Red Devils in Normandy, 6th Airborne Division, 5–6 June 1944" (Bayeux: Editions Heimdal, 2002)''&lt;/ref&gt;
*6 June – RAF fighters bombed and strafed the HQ entourage of 3rd Parachute Brigade (British 6th Airborne Division) near [[Pegasus Bridge]] after mistaking them for a German column. At least 15 men were killed and many others were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;''Pegasus Bridge &amp; Merville Battery: British 6th Airborne Landings in Normandy 6 June 1944.

*8 June – a group of RAF [[Hawker Typhoon]]s attacked the 175th Infantry Regiment, [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|29th U.S. Infantry Division]] on the [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]] Highway, [[France]], causing 24 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond the Beachhead: The 29th Infantry Division in Normandy, 2nd Edition'' p.169, Joseph Balkoski&lt;/ref&gt;
*During [[Operation Cobra]], the American offensive push south from western Normandy, bombs from the U.S. [[Eighth Air Force]] landed on American troops on two separate occasions.
**24 July – Some 1,600 bombers flew in support of the opening bombardment for Cobra. Due to bad weather they were unable to see their targets. Although some were recalled, and others declined to bomb without visibility, a number did, which hit U.S. positions. Twenty-five were killed and 131 wounded in this incident.
**The following day, on 25 July, the operation was repeated by 1,800 bombers of 8th Air Force. On this occasion, the weather was clear, but despite requests by [[First United States Army|First Army]] commander Gen. [[Omar Bradley]] to bomb east to west, along the front in order to avoid [[creepback]], the air commanders made their attack north to south, over Allied lines. As more and more bombs fell short, and U.S. positions again were hit, 111 were killed and 490 wounded. Lieutenant General [[Lesley McNair]] was among the dead, the highest-ranking victim of American friendly fire.
*26 July – [[USAAF]] [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47s]] mistakenly strafed the US 644th Tank Destroyer Battalion near [[Perrières]], France. 20 men were badly injured, but there were no fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;P.20, Battalion Committee. The 644th Tank Destroyer Battalion (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;
*27 July – The former {{HMS|Sunfish|81S|6}} was sunk by a British RAF Coastal Command aircraft in the Norwegian Sea during the beginning of its process of being transferred to the [[Soviet Navy]]. The Captain, [[Israel Fisanovich]], supposedly had taken her out of her assigned area and was diving the sub when the aircraft came in sight instead of staying on the surface and firing signal flares as instructed. All crew, including the British liaison staff, were lost. Later investigation revealed that the RAF crew were at fault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3428.html HMS ''Sunfish''], Uboat.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Two hours later, an RAF Typhoon shot up the Service Company of the 120th Infantry Regiment, US 30th Division, causing several casualties, including Major James Bynum who was killed near Mortain. The officer who replaced him was strafed by another Typhoon a few minutes later and seriously wounded. Around the same time, a Hawker Typhoon attacked the Cannon Company of 120th Infantry Regiment, US 30th Division, near Mortain, killing 15 men.&lt;ref name="Mortain pp.111-112"/&gt; An hour later, RAF Typhoons strafed 'B' Company/US 120th Infantry Regiment on Hill 285, killing a driver of a weapons carrier.&lt;ref&gt;''Battle for Mortain: The 30th Infantry Division Saves the Breakout:  7–12 August 1944'', Alwyn Featherston, p.136 {{ISBN|978-0-89141-662-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Two battalions of the 77th Infantry on [[Guam]] exchanged prolonged fire on 8 August 1944, the incident possibly started with the firing of [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]] for range-finding and angle calibration purposes.

HMS ''Britomart'' and HMS ''Hussar'' took direct hits and were sunk. HMS ''Salamander'' had her stern blown off and sustained heavy damage. HMS ''Jason'' was raked by machine gun fire, killing and wounding several of her crew. Two of the accompanying [[Naval trawler|trawlers]] were also hit. The total loss of life was 117 sailors killed and 153 wounded. The attack had continued despite the attempts by the ships to signal that they were friendly and radio requests by the [[John Robert Baldwin|commander of the aircraft]] for clarification of his target. In the aftermath the surviving sailors were told to keep quiet about the attack. The subsequent court of enquiry identified the fault as lying with the Navy, who had requested the attack on what they thought were enemy vessels entering or leaving Le Havre, and three RN officers were put before a court martial. The commander of the ''Jason'' and his crew were decorated for their part in rescuing their comrades.

:*A group of RAF Hawker Typhoons destroyed two Sherman tanks of the [[Governor General's Foot Guards]], 4th Canadian Armoured Division in the vicinity of [[Maldegem]], [[Belgium]], killing 3 men and injuring 4. One Canadian soldier from the 4th Canadian Armored Division wounded recalled this incident saying "...&amp;nbsp;while so deployed the tanks were suddenly attacked, in mistake, by several Typhoon aircraft. Lt. Middleton-Hope's tank was badly hit, killing the gunner Guardsman Hughes, and the tank was set on fire. Almost immediately Sgt. Jenning's tank was similarly knocked out by Typhoon rockets. Meanwhile the Typhoons continued to press home their attack with machine guns and rockets, and, while trying to extricate the gunner, Lt. Middleton-Hope was killed after his tank was blown off.

As they returned to [[RAF Woodhall Spa]] in [[Lincolnshire]], Sgt McCormack saw a plane flying in the same formation as he was. Believing that it was a German [[Junkers Ju 88]], he attacked the plane, bringing it down over the Dutch town of [[Steenbergen]]. Two of the occupants were killed. It was found out by RAF intelligence officers that it was actually a British [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] flown by [[Commanding officer|CO]] [[Guy Gibson]], who previously took part in Operation Chastise, and his navigator Jim Warwick.

===1945===
*1 January - [[Operation Bodenplatte]] (Baseplate): 900 German fighters and fighter-bombers launched a surprise attack on Allied airfields. Approximately 300 aircraft were lost, 237 pilots killed, missing, or captured, and 18 pilots wounded – the largest single-day loss for the Luftwaffe. Many losses were due to fire from Luftwaffe anti-aircraft batteries, whose crew members had not been informed of the attack.
*5 January - USS Colorado BB-45 friendly gun fire hit superstructure while at Lingayen Gulf Philippines, killing 18 wounding 51 others.
*23 January – A group of RAF fighters strafed the assault gun platoon (105mm Sherman tanks) of US 743rd Tank Battalion, near Sart-Lez-St.Vith, [[Belgium]], killing 6 men and wounding 15.&lt;ref&gt;''The View from the Turret: The 743rd Tank Battalion During WWII'' William Folkestad, P.88 {{ISBN|978-1-57249-192-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*April 24 – The [[Royal Air Force]] carrying out an air raid on [[Rangoon]], [[Burma]], bombed a jail in the belief that it was a [[command center]] for the Japanese Army. Unfortunately, the jail was actually not a Japanese command center but full of Allied [[prisoners of war]]. Over 30 Allied POWs were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=For Your Tomorrow: Canadians and the Burma Campaign, 1941-1945 |author=Robert H.

==Palestine Emergency (1945–48)==
*In 1946, Lieutenant (later Lieutenant-Colonel) [[Colin Campbell Mitchell]] of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] was deployed with his battalion in a crackdown on Jewish militants.

==1948 Arab–Israeli War==
* 10 June 1948: [[Mickey Marcus]], Israel's first general, was shot and killed by a sentry while returning at night to his headquarters.

==Malayan Emergency==
*On January 27, 1951, British troops of 3rd Platoon, 2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]], and Malayan forces of 4th Battalion, [[Royal Malay Regiment]], spotted on what they believed were enemy forces in the forest 40 miles north of [[Pahang]]. However, the "enemy forces" were actually Malayan forces of 2nd Battalion, Royal Malay Regiment, who were patrolling the area for communist insurgents, though the distance made it impossible to clearly identify. Sighting a supposed enemy presence, one British Sergeant called for [[close air support]]. Three [[Royal Air Force]] [[Avro Lincoln]] [[bomber]]s of C Flight 92 Squadron were dispatched from [[Rawang, Selangor]], to support such ground forces. However, the British Sergeant mistakenly grid the "enemy" position five miles from where they were, and one inexperienced bomber navigator also wrongly marked the grid where "enemy" forces were supposed to be and told the other two bombers of the marking. As a result, RAF bombers dropped their 500&amp;nbsp;lb bombs directly on the Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, Royal Malay Regiment, killing 25 British troops and 70 Malayan soldiers. At least 106 British troops and 98 Malayan soldiers were injured.&lt;ref&gt;The Malayan Emergency revisted 1948-1960, page 203-206, AMR holding, Sdn, BHD&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean War==
*3 July 1950 – Eight [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]]s of [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF]] [[strafe]]d and destroyed a train carrying thousands of American and [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean]] soldiers who were mistaken for a North Korean convoy in the main highway between [[Suwon]] and [[Pyongtaek|P'yongtaek]], resulting more than 700 casualties. Before the attack, the Australian pilots had been assured by the United States [[5th Air Force]] Tactical Control Centre that the area under attack was in North Korean hands. However, 20 minutes prior to an attack, the 5th Air Force Tactical Control Centre received intelligence that the area might be under American hands and told the Australian pilots to hold their fire. One Australian pilot ignored the order, believing the train was carrying North Korean forces. The pilot then strafed the train and his squadron followed the lead as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Official History of Australia in the Korean War, Volume II: Combat Operations'' Page 305.&lt;/ref&gt;
*23 September 1950 – [[Battle of Hill 282|Hill 282]] was attacked by 1st Battalion, [[Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders]], part of the [[27th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|British 27th Infantry Brigade]] in the [[United Nations]] force. Having captured it and facing strong [[North Korea]]n counter-attacks, the Argylls, devoid of artillery support, called in an Allied air-strike. A group of [[U.S. Air Force]] [[North American P-51 Mustang|F-51 Mustang]]s of the [[18th Fighter Bomber Wing]] circled the hill. The Argylls had laid down yellow air-recognition panels correctly in accordance with that day's planning, but the North Koreans imitated similar panels on their own positions in white. The Mustangs, confused by the panels, mistakenly [[napalm]]-bombed and [[strafe]]d the Argylls' hill-top positions. Despite a desperate counter-attack by the Argylls to regain the hill, for which Major [[Kenneth Muir (VC)|Kenneth Muir]] was awarded a posthumous [[Victoria Cross]], the Argylls, much reduced in numbers, were forced to relinquish the position. Over 60 of the Argylls' casualties were caused by friendly air-strike.
*During the [[Battle of Wawon]], fleeing soldiers of the South Korean [[II Corps (South Korea)|II Corps]] were mistaken by the [[Turkish Brigade]] as Chinese which led to an exchange of fire. As a result, 20 South Korean soldiers were killed and 4 others wounded with 14 Turkish deaths and 6 wounded.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Mau Mau uprising==
*On June 13, 1953, members of the British 5th [[King's African Rifles]] B Company entered the [[Chuka, Kenya|Chuka area]] in [[Kenya]] to flush out rebels suspected of hiding in the nearby forests. Over the next few days, on what was known as the [[Chuka Massacre]], the regiment had captured and executed 20 people suspected of being Mau Mau fighters for unknown reasons. It is found out that the people executed actually belonged to the [[Kikuyu Home Guard]] — a loyalist militia recruited by the British to fight an increasingly powerful and audacious guerrilla enemy. In an atmosphere of atrocity and reprisal, the matter was swept under the carpet and nobody ever stood trial for the massacre.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Cyprus Emergency==
*December 12, 1955: On the [[Troodos mountains]] near the village of [[Spilia, Cyprus|Spilia]] during the [[Battle of Spilia]], British units from the north and ones from the south, unable to see in the fog and in the belief that they were surrounded by [[EOKA]] fighters, engaged each other in an eight-hour firefight involving [[airstrikes]], artillery [[bombardment]]s, and heavy weapons. This firefight caused 250 casualties, including 127 deaths, 102 injuries, and 21 missing, making it the deadliest friendly fire incident of the war.&lt;ref name="Patriots pg. 67"&gt;British soldiers on Patriots, pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=People of the Eok: British Military Personnel of the Cyprus Emergency, British People of the Cyprus Emergency, Cypriot People of the Eoka |date=Jun 1, 2010 |page=75 |publisher=General Books |isbn=1-156-10372-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On October 15, 1958, 23 British soldiers of 1st Battalion, [[Royal Ulster Rifles]], were killed and 35 others injured while walking near the [[Kyrenia Mountains]] when two British machine gunners mistook them for EOKA fighters and opened fire on them for at least 15 minutes. Some British soldiers yelled multiple times at the machine gunners that they were friendlies and the group they belonged to, but the gunners kept on firing.&lt;ref name="Patriots pg. 67"/&gt;

*19 November 1967, a U.S. Marine Corps. [[F4 Phantom]] aircraft dropped a {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bomb on the command post of the 2nd Battalion (Airborne) 503d Infantry, 173d Airborne Brigade while they were in heavy contact with a numerically superior NVA force. At least 45 paratroopers were killed and another 45 wounded.  Also killed was the Battalion Chaplain Major [[Charles J. Watters]], who was subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor.
*16 March 1968 at FB Birmingham Marine F-4s dropped bombs on the base killing men of the 101st Airborne 16 and wounded 48.
*18 March 1968, around 10 Marines were killed by [[MACV-SOG]] operators mistaking them for enemy forces, when such operators were trying to ambush the supposed enemies. The incident was result of stress and a bad intel, as their commander said that the area was in enemy control.
*16–17 June 1968, {{HMAS|Hobart|D 39|6}}, [[USS Boston (CA-69)|USS Boston]] and {{USS|Edson|DD-946|6}} were attacked by US aircraft. At 03:09, Hobart's radar picked up an aircraft approaching with no IFF transponder active. At 03:14, the aircraft fired a single missile at the ship which killed one sailor, wounded two others and damaged the ship. Two minutes later, the aircraft made a second pass and fired two missiles which caused further damage, killed another sailor and wounded six others. The aircraft came around for a third attack run, but was scared off when Hobart's forward gun turret, under independent control, fired five rounds at it. At 03:30, USS Edson, in company with Hobart, reported coming under fire, and Hobart's captain ordered both destroyers and {{USS|Theodore E. Chandler|DD-717|6}} to take up anti-aircraft formation. At 05:15, the three destroyers linked up with the cruiser [[USS Boston (CA-69)|USS Boston]] (which had been hit by a missile from another aircraft) and the escorting destroyer {{USS|Blandy|DD-943|6}}, and continued anti-aircraft manoeuvring. Debris collected from Hobart and the other ships indicated that the missiles were of United States Air Force (USAF) origin. The attacks on Hobart and the other ships were the capstone of a series of firing incidents between 15 and 17 June, and an inquiry was held by the USN into the incidents, with three RAN personnel attending as technical advisors. The inquiry found that a few hours before the attack on Hobart, Swift Boats PCF-12 and PCF-19, along with {{USCGC|Point Dume|WPB-82325|6}}, were attacked by what they identified at the time as hovering enemy aircraft, but were believed to be friendly planes; PCF-19 was sunk in the attack. F-4 Phantoms of the USAF Seventh Air Force, responding several hours after the attack on the Swift Boats, were unable to distinguish between the radar signature of surface ships and airborne helicopters, and instead opened fire on Hobart, Boston, and Edson.
*5 February 1969, [http://www.virtualwall.org/dg/GriffithTL01a.htm Sgt. Tony Lee Griffith], of [[Company E, 52nd Infantry (LRP) (United States)|H Co. 75th Infantry (Ranger)]], led his five-man long-range reconnaissance team through thick fog and dense, short brush between An Loc and the Cambodian border. Hearing wood being chopped not far off a trail they were assigned to surveil, he had his team set ambush. But members of the North Vietnamese Army had also detected the team. At dawn several enemy soldiers stole through the fog and flung a grenade into the middle of the team, who were spread in line by the trail, in sight of each other. The grenade exploded next to the front scout, Cpl. Richard E. Wilkie, showering him with shrapnel. As the enemy opened fire, the two team members on Wilkie's left panicked and fired in the direction of the grenade's blast. Caught in an intense crossfire, Wilkie, a Special Forces veteran, was shot five times––once by the enemy, twice by his team, and twice by bullets that passed through him. Miraculously, he survived. So, too, did the assistant team leader, Lewis D. Davidson, who was hit twice in the leg. Tony Griffith's luck, however, ended that morning, when he was hit by multiple gunshots to the chest.
*11 May 1969, during the [[Battle of Hamburger Hill]], Lt. Col. Weldon Honeycutt directed helicopter gunships, from an Aerial Rocket Artillery (ARA) battery, to support an infantry assault. In the heavy jungle, the helicopters mistook the command post of the 3/187th battalion for a Vietnamese unit and attacked, killing two and wounding thirty-five, including Honeycutt. This incident disrupted battalion command and control and forced 3/187th to withdraw into night defensive positions.
*1 May 1970, on military operations in [[Phước Tuy Province]] a burst of machine gun fire followed by a calls for the Medic split the night, an Australian machine gunner opened fire on soldiers of the [[8th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] without warning, killing two and wounded two other soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Sheehan's, A Bright Shining Lie&lt;/ref&gt;
*20 July 1970, patrol units of 'D' Company 8th Battalion, [[1st Australian Task Force]] outside the wire at [[Nui Dat]] called in a New Zealand battery fire mission as part of a training exercise. However, there was confusion at the gun position about the fire corrections issued by the inexperienced Australian officer with the patrol. The result was two rounds fell upon the patrol, killing two and wounding several others.&lt;ref&gt;Incident 161 (NZ) Field Battery, 21 July 1970 Combat Battalion, p.176.&lt;/ref&gt;

*A statement issued jointly by the American and the Afghan military commands said a contingent of Afghan police officers fired on United States forces on 10 December 2008 after the Americans had successfully overrun the hide-out, killing the suspected Taliban commander and detaining another man. The US forces after securing the hideout came under heavy small arms fire and explosive grenades from the Afghan Police forces. "Multiple attempts to deter the engagement were unsuccessful," and the US forces returned fire. Afghan police have stated that they came under fire first and that the initial firing on the US forces came from the building next to the police station. This has led the US forces to conclude that the Afghan police forces might have been compromised. Initial reports indicate that this was a tragic case of mistaken identity on both parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/world/asia/11afghan.html?ref=world | work=The New York Times | first=Kirk | last=Semple | title=U.S. Forces Kill 6 Afghan Police Officers by Mistake | date=11 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In December 2009, British commanders called upon a U.S. airstrike which killed Lance Corporal Christopher Roney from [[The Rifles|3rd Battalion The Rifles]] who was engaging along with his comrades with the Taliban. The incident happened when a firefight was going on between British soldiers of 3rd Battalion The Rifles and the insurgents in [[Sangin|Sangin Province]]. Senior British officers were watching a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone's]] grainy images of the fight from [[Camp Bastion]], about 30 miles from the battle at Patrol Base Almas. The officers mistook the soldiers' mud-walled compound for an enemy position and called down a U.S. Apache airstrike on the base. Roney was fatally shot in the head after a helicopter gunship opened fire on the base. He died later the next day after being taken to Camp Bastion. Eleven other British soldiers were wounded in the attack. The coroner criticised the British commanders for the fact Patrol Base Almas was not marked on military maps, for the 'unprofessional' use of grainy images and for insisting there were no friendly forces in the area to the Apache crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2199706/British-soldier-killed-US-Apache-helicopter-friendly-Afghanistan-died-result-mistaken-beliefs-cumulative-failures.html|title=Officers' errors 'killed soldier in friendly fire gunship attack': Coroner condems 'unprofessional' use of grainy images from drone aircraft|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4392">{{short description|2016 hoax about marijuana cigarettes}}
{{tone|date=November 2018}}

The '''Marlboro M Hoax''' was a false rumor originating from satire news website ''Abril Uno'' on April 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abriluno.com/phillip-morris-introduces-marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=Phillip Morris Introduces ‘Marlboro M’ Marijuana Cigarettes|last=RapidxHTML|work=Abril Uno|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] joke.

== Hoax ==
The article claims that Philip Morris, owner of the Marlboro tobacco company, is introducing a new line of marijuana cigarettes called Marlboro M in Colorado and the state of Washington. While fake, the article does have some factual basis, as tobacco companies have shown interest in marijuana since the 1970's.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BARRY|first=RACHEL ANN|last2=HIILAMO|first2=HEIKKI|last3=GLANTZ|first3=STANTON A.|date=2014-06|title=Waiting for the Opportune Moment: The Tobacco Industry and Marijuana Legalization|url=https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/waiting-for-the-opportune-moment-the-tobacco-industry-and-marijuana-legalization/|journal=Milbank Quarterly|language=en-US|volume=92|issue=2|pages=207–242|doi=10.1111/1468-0009.12055|issn=0887-378X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the article was quite obviously satire, it's intriguing title was able to make it around the internet before it could be disproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=FACT CHECK: Has Phillip Morris Introduced 'Marlboro M' Marijuana Cigarettes?|work=Snopes.com|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/no-philip-morris-not-introduced-marlboro-m-cannabis-cigarette|title=False: Marlboro Marijuana Cigarettes from Phillip Morris {{!}} Leafly|date=2016-10-10|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users, upon discovering that there were no 'Marlboro M' cigarettes at their local dispensary, claimed that they would be in stock by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Cannettes/comments/63jxuv/what_are_marijuana_cigarettes_called_cannettes/|title=r/Cannettes - What are Marijuana Cigarettes Called? (Cannettes)|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis ==
While the article was proven fake, its claims were able gain widespread belief because of past and current events in cannabis culture,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} which themselves were true. For example, it is true that tobacco companies, including Phillip Morris, were interested in marijuana as a competing product and potentially an addition to their company, long before rapid legalization came about.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/big-tobacco-pot-weed-cannabis-industry-727407/|title=Big Tobacco Is Already Eyeing Pot|last=Benson|first=Thor|date=2018-09-25|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legalization is also a contributing factor to the blind acceptance these claims received, as societal views on marijuana use have largely shifted in recent years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marycarreon/2018/05/17/new-study-highlights-the-social-impacts-of-cannabis-legalization-in-california/#1836c73e2194|title=New Study Highlights The Social Impacts Of Cannabis Legalization In California|last=Carreon|first=Mary|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tobacco companies have actually began investing in medical marijuana research, as well as joining with marijuana seed investment firms, though they haven't gone as far is to introduce cannabis cigarettes into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/07/22/big-tobacco-makes-its-first-investment-in-the-mari.aspx|title=Big Tobacco Makes Its First Investment in the Marijuana Industry --  The Motley Fool|last=Williams|first=Sean|date=2018-07-22|work=The Motley Fool|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it would be illegal for such a large company, such as Philip Morris, to introduce cannabis cigarettes, as its use is still illegal on the federal level (in the US).

The '''May 2018 inter-Korean summit''' was the second inter-Korean summit in 2018.

Moon was accompanied by his spy chief, [[Suh Hoon]], while Kim was joined by [[Kim Yong-chol]], a former military intelligence chief who is now a vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party's central committee tasked with inter-Korean relations.

==Agenda==
[[File:InterKorean Summit 1st v23.jpg|thumb|Moon and Kim talking at the summit]]
Two leaders of North and South Koreas exchanged their opinions about the issues and solutions for the Trump-Kim summit &lt;ref name=may26summit /&gt;  as Trump abruptly cancelled the upcoming US-North Korea summit on 12 June. The principal agenda of the meeting was trying to get U.S. summit back on track and keep progressing the denuclearization talks,&lt;ref name=Chicagotribune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-north-and-south-korea-surprise-summit-20180526-story.html |title=North and South Korean leaders hold surprise meeting in DMZ to get U.S. summit back on track |work=Chicago Tribune |date=26 May 2018|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meeting==

The second 2018 summit was established by [[Kim Jong-un]]'s suggestion within a whirlwind 24 hour notice,&lt;ref name=may26summit /&gt; but Moon Jae-in accepted Kim's invitation &lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; as per the critical nuclear agenda between North and South Korea. [[Moon Jae-in]] had expressed his belief, and he discussed with [[Kim Jong Un]] about Kim's willingness to join nuclear interventions with Trump.&lt;ref name=Chicagotribune /&gt;  Moon and Kim agreed to also convene inter-Korean high-level talks on 1 June, to be followed by talks between military authorities to ease military tensions and Red Cross talks for the reunion of separated families.&lt;ref name=may27 /&gt;  Both leaders also agreed to accelerate the implementation of the Panmunjom Declaration and meet again at "anytime and anyplace" without formality.&lt;ref name=may27 /&gt;

==Aftermath==

During 1 June meeting, officials from both countries agreed to move forward with the military and Red Cross talks.&lt;ref name=june1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/01/rival-koreas-agree-to-military-red-cross-talks-for-peace.html |title=Rival Koreas agree to military, Red Cross talks for peace |publisher=CNBC |date=1 June 2018 |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Koreas also agreed to reopen a former liaison office located within a factory park in [[Kaesong]] which had been jointly operated by the countries until the South shut it down in February 2016 after a North Korean nuclear test.&lt;ref name=june1 /&gt;  The first talks involving the Red Cross and military were then held at North Korea's [[Mount Kumgang]] resort on 22 June 2018 and during the talks, it was agreed that family reunions which had been cancelled in 2015 would resume between 20 and 26 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/diplomacy/article/2152091/north-and-south-korea-confirm-family-reunions-will-resume-august |title=North and South Korea confirm family reunions will resume in August for the first time since 2015 |work=South China Morning Post |date=22 June 2018 |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Alfred "Mike" Warnke''' (born November 19, 1946) is an American [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and [[comedian]]. With the success of his books and recordings, Warnke became one of evangelical Christianity's best-known experts on the subject of [[Satanism]] during the 1980s, before his claims of having been a Satanist high priest were discredited in 1991 by the Christian magazine, ''[[Cornerstone (magazine)|Cornerstone]]''.

==Early life==
Mike Warnke was born in 1946 to parents Alfred "Al" Warnke and Louise Warnke. When he was five years old, the Warnke family moved to [[Manchester, Tennessee]] where his father opened a [[truck stop]]. In 1955, Warnke's mother was killed in a car accident. In 1958 his father died, leaving Warnke an [[orphan]]. After the death of his father, Warnke was taken to live with two of his aunts in [[Sparta, Tennessee]], and from there to his father's half-sister and her husband in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]], [[California]]. In June 1965, Warnke graduated from [[Rim of the World High School]] in [[Lake Arrowhead, California|Lake Arrowhead]]. That September, he enrolled at [[San Bernardino Valley College]] but withdrew after one semester, whereupon by his account, Warnke began his tenure as a Satanist. On June 2, 1966, Warnke enlisted in the [[United States Navy]]. After graduating from boot-camp on August 22, 1966, Warnke's assigned [[military occupational specialty]] was as a hospital [[corpsman]].&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose&gt;{{cite journal|url =http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/sellingsatan.htm |title = Selling Satan |work = Cornerstone |issue=98 |year=1992 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629063019/http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/sellingsatan.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the account of his life in ''The Satan Seller'', Warnke [[Conversion to Christianity|converted to Christianity]] during navy [[recruit training|boot camp]].&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt; However, high-school acquaintance Charlotte Tweeten has stated she recalls him proclaiming faith in [[Christ]] in the year prior to his navy enlistment in 1966.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt; Warnke also wrote that he began dating fellow Rim of the World High School alumna, Sue Studer, during this time period. This has been disproven, however, and Warnke was actually engaged to Lois Eckenrod at this time.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt; In 1967, Warnke completed naval [[corpsman]] training, returned to [[San Diego]], and married Studer.  Together, they had two children.&lt;ref name=warnke-response&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/warnke_response/csr0009a.htm |date=1992-07-15 |title = Warnke's statement in response to Cornerstone's claims |work = Cornerstone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629063109/http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/warnke_response/csr0009a.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Warnke was deployed to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] for a six-month tour of duty.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-vietnam&gt;''Cornerstone'', issue 98: "Records show Warnke was in Vietnam for only six months"&lt;/ref&gt;  Having been wounded in battle during those six months, Warnke was awarded the [[Purple Heart]]. Warnke's own written accounts differ on the number of times he sustained injuries during his time in Vietnam. In ''The Satan Seller'', Warnke says he was wounded twice, while in his second book, ''Hitchhiking on Hope Street'', he states he was wounded five times. Despite these wounds received during his tour of duty as a hospital corpsman, second class,  Warnke's various accounts have him spending much time detained, allegedly killing a man in battle, and surviving being shot several times, including once by an arrow. Warnke says it was the latter wound for which he was awarded the Purple Heart.&lt;ref&gt;''Hey Doc'' recording. Word Records&lt;/ref&gt; Warnke returned to the United States in 1970.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt;

While still serving in the navy, Warnke teamed up with San Diego [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Morris Cerullo]] and was touted for his "Satanist experience". Warnke and Cerullo toured the country participating in charismatic [[revival meeting]]s. Cerullo wanted to write a book about youth occultism, and assigned the writing task to David Balsiger with help from Warnke. In early 1972, Warnke requested and received an early discharge from the navy as a [[conscientious objector]] so that he could work full-time in the ministry. Warnke then left Cerullo's ministry to start his own, forbidding Cerullo to use any of his material. It was at this time that Warnke and Balsiger went on to write the book that would make Warnke famous.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt;

==Rise to fame==

===''The Satan Seller''===
In 1972, Warnke's book ''The Satan Seller'' was released. Written by Warnke, with help from Balsiger and [[Les Jones (author)|Les Jones]], the book tells of Warnke being orphaned as a child and his introduction into Satanism. Further detailed is Warnke's participation in sexual orgies, alcoholism, and drug dealing; his rise in the ranks of Satanism to the level of "high priest"; presiding over Satanic rituals including magical spells, summoning demons, ritual sex including a ritual kidnap and rape; the attempt on his life &amp;mdash; a [[heroin]] [[overdose]] &amp;mdash; that left him angry and disillusioned; his heroism in [[Vietnam]]; and how he found Jesus and came home as an evangelist. The story ends with Warnke living happily in California with wife Sue Studer. In fewer than three months after the release, ''The Satan Seller'' had become a religious best-seller.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt;

The book launched Warnke into stardom within [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian communities. He became a popular speaker at Christian meeting places such as [[Melodyland]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[California]]. In 1974, Warnke moved his family to attend Trinity Bible College in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]], as a nine-month preparation for ministry. It was here, while among other [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] Christians and recent converts preparing for a life of ministry, that Warnke met Carolyn Alberty and the two began a sexual affair.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt;&lt;!-- LEAVE CITATION IN--&gt; Warnke also met Elijah Coady, an [[episcopi vagantes|independent, schismatic bishop]] of the Syro-Chaldean Church, also known as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] or the Nestorian church. Coady [[ordained]] Warnke as a [[deacon]]. Upon graduation, Warnke was again ordained, and Warnke moved with his family to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt;

===Recordings and wives===
In November 1975 at an [[Indiana]] [[coffeehouse]], Warnke's talk about his conversion from Satanism to Christianity was incidentally recorded. This recording became Warnke's first [[album]], ''Alive'', which was soon widely played on [[Christian radio]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Later that same year, despite interventions from pastors and other acclaimed ministers, Warnke left his wife for Alberty and filed for divorce. The divorce was finalized in December 1975 and four months later, Warnke married Alberty.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt;

Warnke's popularity earned him the cover of the September 1976 issue of the Christian magazine, ''Harmony''. In 1977, Warnke released his second album, ''Jester In The King's Court''. In 1978, Warnke recounted his Vietnam experiences on his third album, ''Hey, Doc!''. His albums became "the most popular [[Christian comedy]] albums ever produced".&lt;ref name=ccm&gt;As quoted in ''Cornerstone'' issue 98: {{Cite news |title = When Mike Warnke Speaks, the World Listens! |periodical = Contemporary Christian Music |date = 1979-02-26 |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a tour to [[Hazard, Kentucky|Hazard]], [[Kentucky]], Warnke met Rose Hall, a thrice-divorced mother of three children. At this time, Warnke began courting Hall while still married to his second wife. Warnke's second marriage came to an end when, as Alberty stated in an interview,&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt;&lt;!-- DO NOT REMOVE CITATION--&gt; "[Warnke] threw me into a wall and split my head open. He said, 'If you go to a local hospital and tell them what your name is, I'll kill you.'" Alberty fled to Florida. By November 1979, their divorce was final, and Warnke moved to Hall's farm in Kentucky. On January 2, 1980, Warnke and Hall were married.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt;

Warnke and his label, [[Word Records]], feuded over an album which he eventually produced and distributed on his own, ''A Christian's Perspective on Halloween '' (1979). Word Records and Warnke reconciled by 1981,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} resulting in ''Coming Home'' (1981), and now including wife Rose, ''Higher Education'' (1982) and ''Growing Up'' (1983). Then under Word's [[DaySpring Records|Dayspring]] label, he released (solo) ''Stuff Happens'' (1985), ''Good News Tonight'' (1986), ''One In A Million'' (1988), ''Live ... Totally Weird'' (1989).&lt;ref name=album-list&gt;[http://ccmdiscography.150m.com/W-WebSite.html The Exhaustive Christian Music Discography: W] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314025935/http://ccmdiscography.150m.com/W-WebSite.html |date=March 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sweet-music-list&gt;{{cite web |author=Sweet-Music.com |url=http://www.sweet-music.com/WW.html |title=W - Complete Alphabetical Christian Music catalogue listing: Sweet Christian Music - Celebrating Our 10th Year Shipping WorldWide! |publisher=Sweet-music.com |date=2011-09-28 |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930192642/http://www.sweet-music.com/WW.html |archivedate=September 30, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Warnke also made a VHS home video, ''Do You Hear Me?'' (1989).

During the 1980s, Warnke's ministry prospered, as Warnke and his new wife toured and performed together, raising millions of dollars for their ministry. Contributions to the ministry were over $1 million in 1985, and over $2 million each year from 1987 through 1990.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt;&lt;!--facts checked; Cornerstone obtained HOCCK filings and cited them in article {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}--&gt; As the Warnkes' popularity waxed, their personal relationship waned. In 1984, Warnke's wife wrote, "Satan provided a woman to fill the gap in Michael's life."&lt;ref name="great-pretender"&gt;As cited by ''Cornerstone'' expose: {{cite book |author = Rose Hall Warnke |author2=Joan Hake Robie |isbn = 0-914984-03-9 | title = The Great Pretender |location= Lancaster, PA |publisher = Starburst Publishers | year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Warnkes separated in 1989 and later divorced in 1991. Six weeks after the divorce was finalized, Warnke married [[Rim of the World High School]] alumna Susan Patton.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt;

===Extravagant claims===
In 1982, Warnke began to exaggerate his achievements. During the 1980s, Warnke's claims of academic degrees increased from two [[Bachelor's degree]]s to two [[Master's Degree]]s to a [[Doctorate of Philosophy]].&lt;!--As stated on Higher Education {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} --&gt; In ''The Satan Seller'', Warnke says he was wounded twice while in Vietnam. In ''Hitchhiking on Hope Street'', he said he had been wounded five times.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt; Warnke followed up his interest in the [[Syro-Chaldean]] tradition and his 1970s ordination as a deacon with a 1983 ordination by independent bishop Richard Morrill, lately of the Byzantine Catholic Church, Inc. This ordination allowed Warnke to call himself bishop.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-expose/&gt;

===National exposure===
On May 16, 1985, Warnke appeared in a prime-time news report about [[Satanism]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]''. In the show's episode titled "The Devil Worshippers", Warnke was included in a number of segments where he discussed the implements and clothing used in Satanic ceremonies, a scar allegedly indicating where he was repeatedly cut so that his blood could be used in Satanic ceremonies, and what drew him to Satanism.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news |title = The Devil Worshippers |work = |publisher = ABC News 20/20 transcript, show #521 |date = May 16, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Warnke's appearance on ''20/20'', he was frequently cited as an expert on the [[occult]] by Christian radio host [[Bob Larson]] and the [[Chick Publications]] stable of authors.

==Investigation and debunking==
In 1991, ''[[Cornerstone (magazine)|Cornerstone]]'' magazine launched an investigation into Warnke's life and testimony. The previous year, Cornerstone had debunked [[Laurel Rose Willson|Lauren Stratford]]'s story that had been recounted in ''[[Satan's Underground]]''. Stratford claimed her deep involvement in Satanism led her to partake in a ritual in which her own child was [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]]. After the exposé showed Stratford's alleged child had never existed, Cornerstone journalists Mike Hertenstein and Jon Trott investigated Warnke and his life.

The ''Cornerstone'' investigation spanned from interviews with over 100 of Warnke's personal friends and acquaintances to his ministry's tax receipts. The investigation revealed a number of inaccuracies and evidence of [[fraud]] and [[deceit]] in Warnke's accounts. During the course of ''Cornerstone'''s investigation, pictures of Warnke taken during the time he was alleged to be a Satanist priest were discovered. Rather than showing an emaciated drug-addict sporting long fingernails and waist-length hair, the pictures showed Warnke as a typical 'square' of the mid-1960s. The investigation also revealed Warnke's claims that he and [[Charles Manson]] had attended a Satanic ritual to be false; Manson was in federal prison at the time, having no known ties to Satanic churches.

The investigation further uncovered that before joining the Navy, Warnke had been involved with the college Christian ministry [[Campus Crusade for Christ]]. The investigation also revealed the unflattering circumstances surrounding Warnke's multiple marriages, affairs, and divorces. Most critically, however, the investigation showed how Warnke could not have done the many things he claimed to have taken part in throughout the nine months he claimed to be a Satanist - including his claims to be a drug-addicted dealer or a Satanic high priest.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-dates&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/dates.htm |title = Why the Dates Don't Work (sidebar) |work = Cornerstone |issue=98 |year=1992 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629063030/http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/dates.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before publishing the article, ''Cornerstone'' contacted Warnke for an interview, but he and ''Cornerstone'' could not agree to the terms of an interview.&lt;ref name=warnke-response/&gt;&lt;ref name=cornerstone-update/&gt; In June 1992, at the annual [[CBA (Christian trade association)|Christian Booksellers Association]] convention, ''Cornerstone'' revealed its story.

==Aftermath==
Warnke sent a response to ''Cornerstone'',&lt;ref name=warnke-response/&gt; published in July, insisting he told the truth, stating:
{{quote|I stand by my testimony of being delivered and set free by the power of Jesus Christ after being a Satanic high priest exactly as published in my book, ''The Satan Seller''.... some information was purposefully changed to protect the privacy of certain individuals and to prevent readers from using the book as a guide for occultism and Satanic purposes. But, as we stated in the front of the book, 'The events are absolutely as described.'}} Despite these assertions, Warnke did not provide the name of a single Satanist but used invectives against ex-wife Carolyn.&lt;ref name=warnke-response/&gt; In the ensuing months, Warnke conceded parts of the allegations, telling ''Christianity Today'' that there had been only 13 members of his coven, not 1,500 as originally claimed, and that of those 13, the whereabouts of five were unknown to him, while the other eight had since died.&lt;ref name="lied"&gt;Jay Grelen. "Christian comedian says he lied about coven", ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'', November 3, 1992, page B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public response was varied but was nevertheless overwhelmingly against Warnke.&lt;ref name=cornerstone-update&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss099/warnke_update.htm |title = Warnke Update |issue=99 |work = Cornerstone |year=1992 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629063024/http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss099/warnke_update.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Word Records stated that they would stand by their artist. However, further investigations by local Kentucky reporters at the ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' revealed that Warnke's ministry had engaged in financial misdeeds and that "Mike, his ex-wife Rose, and her brother Neale [Hall] received a total of $809,680 in salary at a time when the ministry newsletter claimed donations were down and more funds were needed."&lt;ref name=cornerstone-update/&gt; One week later, Word Records dropped Warnke from its label. Finally, on September 30, 1992, fewer than 100 days after the investigation was made public, Warnke Ministries closed its doors.&lt;ref name="grelen"&gt;Jay Grelen. "Christian comedian set to close doors of troubled ministry", ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' (KY), September 30, 1992, page C13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1993, Warnke submitted to the authority of an assembly of ministers "acting as elders", acknowledging his "ungodliness", his "multiple divorces", his "failure as husband, father, and friend", and of "embellishment and exaggeration ... in an attempt ... to entertain", and offering to pay [[back taxes]] to the federal government. The group recommended specific changes to the ministry, including a [[salary cap]] and accountability reports.&lt;ref name="okla2000"&gt;Tamie Ross. "Laughs stopped for Christian comic: Mike Warnke offers fans new outlook after ministry's crash", ''The Daily Oklahoman'', September 30, 2000, page 1B&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he continued to "stand by [his] testimony of former Satanic involvement"&lt;ref name=warnke-apology&gt;Warnke's [http://www.mikewarnke.org/packet22.html 1993 statement of apology and repentance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504182948/http://www.mikewarnke.org/packet22.html |date=May 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating in a 2000 interview with the ''[[Daily Oklahoman]]'', "Exaggeration did creep into some of my stories, but my testimony is still my testimony."&lt;ref name="okla2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="modesto"&gt;"Local notes - Controversial comedian", ''[[The Modesto Bee]]'' (CA), February 2, 2002, page G1: ''"Mike Warnke, a popular 1970s Christian comedian later accused of fabricating claims about his Satanist past, will speak at Pentecostal Church of God Friday through February 10. ... It is unlikely he will talk about his colorful past, said Hughson Pastor Roy Little. Warnke speaks these days about his current Christian faith."''&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, a letter posted on Warnke's web site indicated the group had released him as having met their accountability requirements.&lt;ref name="rancho"&gt;Monique H. Henderson. "Spotlight: Christian comedian Mike Warnke comes to Rancho Mirage: his humor is in the past", ''[[The Press-Enterprise]]'' ([[Riverside, CA]]), October 3, 2007, page B2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Warnke suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} In 2000, he began attempting a [[wiktionary:comeback|comeback]], limited to small churches in Kentucky.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} In 2002, he published ''Friendly Fire: A Recovery Guide for Believers Battered by Religion'' ({{ISBN|0-7684-2124-1}}), an account of what he perceived as his unfair treatment by fellow Christians in the wake of the ''Cornerstone'' exposé.&lt;ref name="rancho"/&gt; &lt;!-- (Website no longer mentions his satanic notoriety: 2007-03-22) As of December 2006, his [http://www.mikewarnke.org/default.asp?startpage=bios.asp website biography] claimed that he is a former Satanic high priest. --&gt; By 2004, he was making occasional performing appearances at churches around the country, often referred to simply as "Christian comedian Mike Warnke",&lt;ref name="mo-07"&gt;"This week" (local events column), ''Springfield News-Leader'' (MO), September 15, 2007, page 2C: ''"Shoal Creek Revival Church ...

'''Nina Maksimovna Raspopova''' ({{Lang-ru|Нина Максимовна Распопова}}; 31 December 1913 – 2 July 2009) was a commander in the [[Night Witches|46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment]], 325th Night Bomber Aviation Division, [[4th Air and Air Defence Forces Army|4th Air Army]], [[2nd Belorussian Front]] during World War II. For her service in the military she was awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] on 15 May 1946.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=1647|title=Распопова Нина Максимовна|website=www.warheroes.ru|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civilian life ==
Raspopova was born on 31 December 1913 to a Russian family in the city of [[Magdagachi]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. She graduated from the Blagoveshchensk Mining College before graduating from the Khabarovsk flight school in 1933. She then moved on to the Central Aeroclub in Moscow for the remainder of her civil aviation training and graduated in 1940. Before enlisting in the military she worked as a geologist in mines in Transbaikalia as well as a flight instructor in Spassk of the Far Eastern Territories and in the Omsk and Mytishchi flight clubs of Moscow. At one point the Komsomol forbid her and several other students from flying, but the decision was eventually revoked and Raspopova was permitted to fly again.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://airaces.narod.ru/woman/raspopva.htm|title=Распопова Нина Максимовна|last=|first=|date=|website=airaces.narod.ru|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military career ==
Raspopova joined the military in October 1941 after the start of the Great Patriotic War and after completing training was sent to the Eastern front in May 1942.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tamanskipolk46.narod.ru/p60aa1.html|title=Распопова Нина|website=tamanskipolk46.narod.ru|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On one mission in 1942 after a standard bombing attack the [[Polikarpov Po-2]] she was flying was hit by anti-aircraft fire from Axis forces. To avoid more fire, she maneuvered the plane into a steep dive leading Axis forces into thinking they had been shot down; when she began to increase altitude over a lake, her navigator noticed that the fuel tank had been punctured from the fire.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Нас называли ночными ведьмами|last=Rakobolskaya|first=Irina|last2=Kravtsova|first2=Natalya|publisher=Moscow State University|year=2005|isbn=|location=Moscow|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On another mission that same year her Po-2 was again hit by anti-aircraft fire, that time causing more damage to the aircraft. The fuel tank exploded and sprayed fuel over the cabin, damaged the engines, and seriously injured her navigator Larissa Radchikova. The plane landed on a minefield but all crew members were rescued by an artillery unit commissioner sent to search for them. Having sustained several injuries requiring surgery, Raspopova received surgery and returned to the military in less than two months.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She participated in the battles of Crimea, Berlin, and Warsaw. In the war she made 805 sorties, sometimes making as many as eight sorties in one night.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Later life ==
Raspopova was awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] and an Order of Lenin on 15 May 1946 for "for exemplary fulfillment of commanded missions and demonstration of courage and heroism in battles against the German fascist invaders".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

She did not continue an aviation career after the war, but stayed in touch with many of fellow members of the regiment, remaining social and working as a secretary for a local council. She passed away at the age of 96 in Mytischi, Moscow in 2 July 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9235">On August 8, 2007, during a canine training exercise, [[North Carolina Highway Patrol]] Sgt. Charles L. Jones was video taped by cell phone hanging his assigned [[police dog]] by the neck and repeatedly kicking the dog in order for it to release a [[chew toy]] that was in the dog's mouth. Jones claimed he was following proper canine handling procedure.

The incident originally led to Jones being dismissed and North Carolina canceling its Highway Patrol K-9 program, but on November 22, 2010, a North Carolina Superior Court Judge ruled that Jones was improperly dismissed, and awarded Jones back salary and attorney fees.

==Timeline==
On August 8, 2007, during a training process at the [[North Carolina Highway Patrol]] Training Center, Trooper Ray Herndon video taped Jones hanging and kicking his assigned police dog, a [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Malinois)]] named Ricoh, when the dog refused to release its favorite chew toy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/2803389/ |title=Video of Alleged Animal Abuse by Trooper Played in Court |publisher=WRAL.com |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the training exercise, the video footage was given to Jones' superiors, however, no action was taken to investigate or discipline Jones.&lt;ref name="policeone1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policeone.com/police-products/k9/articles/1350208-S-C-state-officer-accused-of-abusing-K9/ |title=S.C. state officer accused of abusing K9 |publisher=The News &amp; Observer |date=September 1, 2007 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One supervisor's administrative assistant was Jones' wife, and both lived in the superior's house in [[Wake County, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="policeone2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kane |first=Dan |url=http://www.policeone.com/investigations/articles/1751429-Officer-who-kicked-K-9-had-dog-in-backyard/ |title=Officer who kicked K-9 had dog in backyard |publisher=The News &amp; Observer |date=November 1, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' other supervisor was given a written warning for failing to report the existence of the video to his superiors.&lt;ref name="policeone3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kane |first=Dan |url=http://www.policeone.com/police-products/k9/k9-training/articles/1690718-N-C-troopers-defend-fired-K9-handler/ |title=N.C. troopers defend fired K9 handler |publisher=The News &amp; Observer |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 28, 2007, the video tape and investigation was given to the internal affairs unit of the Highway Patrol and ultimately the matter was turned over to the [[North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation]] and the [[Wake County, North Carolina]] district attorney's office.&lt;ref name="policeone1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="conduct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/1782927/ |title=State Troopers' Conduct Raises Concerns |publisher=WRAL.com |date=September 7, 2007 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 2007, Jones was placed on paid administrative leave while being investigated.&lt;ref name="policeone1"/&gt; On September 8, 2007, Jones was given a pre-dismissal hearing. Internal affairs recommended Jones be terminated,&lt;ref name="policeone3"/&gt; and Jones was terminated the following day.&lt;ref name="conduct"/&gt;

In April 2008, a three-day hearing was held in Jones' lawsuit against the state of [[North Carolina]] and the [[North Carolina Highway Patrol]] for wrongful termination. According to Jones, his technique for forcing the dog to release the chew toy was part of standard police dog training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/2756250/ |title=Official: 'Political Intervention' Prevented Due Process in Trooper Firing |publisher=WRAL.com |date=April 18, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 30, 2008 the Secretary of the State Department of Crime Control and Public Safety suspended the operations of the K-9 program, saying he was disturbed by evidence at Jones' hearing that some troopers thought kicking a dog was acceptable training.&lt;ref name="suspends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/2814716/ |title=State suspends Highway Patrol K-9 operations |publisher=WRAL.com |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, the North Carolina State Personnel Commission ordered the Highway Patrol to reinstate Jones, stating it did not find "just cause to dismiss for unacceptable personal conduct." However, it did find "sufficient cause for discipline for unsatisfactory job performance." &lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/6748627/ |title=Highway Patrol appeals decision to reinstate ex-K-9 trooper |publisher=WRAL.com |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several animal advocate groups campaigned for Officer Jones to face criminal charges for his actions, however, no criminal charges were filed. Jones' police dog, Ricoh, was removed from his possession and retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/image/2806147/?ref_id=2809345 |title=Former Sgt. Charles Jones |publisher=WRAL.com |date=April 28, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2008, Ricoh was found living back with Jones. The Highway Patrol had given Ricoh to another trooper after it was retired, and that trooper gave the dog back to Jones.&lt;ref name="policeone2"/&gt; That trooper testified on his behalf at the April 2008 hearing to reinstate Jones. The Highway Patrol had asked the trooper to return the dog, but he refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kane |first=Dan |url=http://www.policeone.com/police-products/police-dogs/articles/1767589-N-C-highway-patrol-cant-get-K-9-back/ |title=N.C. highway patrol can't get K-9 back |publisher=News &amp; Observer |date=December 20, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jones' own reports of more than 240 training sessions leading up to the kicking incident, Jones issued one positive report after another for Ricoh. For the past 18 months, the reports showed that Ricoh obeyed voice commands and hand signals, found illegal drugs stashed in cars and buildings, or passed by those that were clean. He was praised, rewarded or both nearly every time. "Ricoh was utilized for an obedience exercise," Jones wrote in one report on June 11, 2007. "Ricoh did well following all voice and hand commands. Ricoh was rewarded and praised." However, Jones and his former fellow officers testified that Ricoh was a "maniac" and "hard to handle".&lt;ref name="lawofficer1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kane |first=Dan |url=http://www.lawofficer.com/article/k9/fired-trooper-used-report-rico |title=Fired Trooper Used to Report Ricoh Was a Smart Dog |publisher=LawOfficer.com |date=October 12, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy between the reports and the testimony prompted a criminal investigation by the State Bureau of Investigation.&lt;ref name="lawofficer1"/&gt;

In December 2008, after the testimony of Jones and his former fellow officers about their canine handling techniques, the North Carolina Highway Patrol canceled its K-9 program indefinitely.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} In June 2009, the patrol implemented a new program with new dogs and handlers. Six [[Labrador Retrievers]] had been paired with freshly trained troopers. The Highway Patrol now uses [[Labrador Retrievers]] instead of Shepherd breeds, because they are better at detecting drugs, which is the dogs' primary duty.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/5332150/ |title=Highway Patrol starts new canine program |publisher=WRAL.com |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wrongful termination lawsuit==
After the Highway Patrol refused to rehire Jones following an October 2008 ruling by a state committee that Jones should be reinstated, Jones sued the state of [[North Carolina]] and the Highway Patrol for reinstatement and back salary plus attorney's fees.&lt;ref name="policeone1"/&gt;

On November 22, 2010, a superior court judge ruled that Jones was improperly dismissed, and that Jones should receive back salary and attorney fees. The judge ruled that although Jones' actions were not among the training techniques specifically approved by the Highway Patrol, "they were no worse than the agency's accepted methods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2010/11/24/1862093/ruling-rehire-fired-k-9-state.html |title=Ruling: Rehire fired K-9 state trooper |publisher=Charlotteobserver.com - via, wayback.com |date=November 24, 2010 |accessdate=February 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128023147/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2010/11/24/1862093/ruling-rehire-fired-k-9-state.html |archivedate=November 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phantom settlements''', or '''paper towns''', are settlements that appear on maps but do not actually exist. They are either accidents or [[Fictitious entry|copyright trap]]s. Notable examples include [[Argleton]], [[Lancashire]], UK and [[Beatosu and Goblu]], US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00trzfl Punt, Steve (2010) Punt PI, Series 3, Episode 1, BBC Radio Four, Aired 17 September 2010] Accessed 17 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agloe, New York]], was invented on a 1930s map as a copyright trap. In 1950, a general store was built there and named Agloe General Store, as that was the name seen on the map. Thus the phantom settlement became a real one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krulwich|first=Robert|title=An Imaginary Town Becomes Real, Then Not. True Story|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2014/03/18/290236647/an-imaginary-town-becomes-real-then-not-true-story|publisher=NPR|accessdate=20 March 2014|date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also misnamed settlements, such as the villages of Mawdesky and Dummy 1325 in [[Lancashire]] on Google Maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southportvisiter.co.uk/news/southport-news/see-new-villages-mawdesky-dummy-6618605 Byrne, Michael (2009) See the new villages of Mawdesky and Dummy 1325 on Google Maps], Nov 20 2009, ''Southport Visiter''. Accessed 21 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Bielefeld Conspiracy|humorous conspiracy theory]] that the German city of [[Bielefeld]] is a phantom settlement, despite that it has a population of over 300,000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5056">'''Pikkujoulu''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] for "little Christmas") is a Finnish traditional party held to anticipate [[Christmas]]. The Pikkujoulu party is non-formal, highly festive, and themed after Christmas. Pikkujoulu parties are held by various communities, organisations, companies, or just among friends.

==Description==
Pikkujoulu differs from Christmas as more free-form and less [[religion|religious]]. Traditionally, Pikkujoulu is a day when Christmas dishes are served for the first time. These include [[rice pudding]] with fruit. &lt;ref&gt; Life in Finland [http://weareinfinland.com/pikkujoulu-celebrating-the-start-of-the-christmas-season-in-finland/ Pikkujoulu – celebrating the start of the Christmas season in Finland](accessed 15 May 2014) &lt;/ref&gt;The most traditional Pikkujoulu drink is called “[[mulled wine|glögi]]” (the Finnish equivalent of the German Glühwein or mulled wine), which can be served with or without alcohol. Glögi is made of hot juice or red wine and spiced with cinnamon, ginger, clove, raisins, and almonds. &lt;ref&gt; ESN FINT [http://esnfint.org/content/holidays-and-festivities-finland#pik Holidays and festivities in Finland], (accessed 15 May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

For entertainment, there are festive speeches often followed by jokes or humorous sketches, after which, mock awards are given out. Song books are then passed out and happy Christmas hits are sung in Finnish, English, or Swedish. Christmas karaoke has become quite popular, and any performer will garner applause, no matter how unpleasant they may sound. There could also be a band, stand-up comedian, magician, or funny play. Every Pikkujoulu celebration has a Santa Claus giving out little gag gifts. 
&lt;ref&gt; Embassy of Finland in Athens News, [http://www.finland.gr/public/default.aspx?contentid=235409&amp;nodeid=32252&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US Show me the way to the next pikkujoulu], (accessed 15 May 2014) &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Pikkujoulu Christmas parties around Helsinki, Finland caused 400 police calls on the same night. Helsinki police attributed the high number of calls to alcohol consumption. &lt;ref&gt; yle UUTISET [http://yle.fi/uutiset/pikku_joulu_high_jinks_keep_police_busy/6950960 Pikku Joulu high jinks keep police busy] (accessed 15 May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Finnish Pikkujoulu is similar to other Nordic pre Christmas traditions, such as the Norwegian [[julebord]] and Swedish [[Smörgåsbord|julbord]]. In recent years some Norwegians have started to adapt their julebord to the Pikkujoulu, washing out the differences between these Nordic pre Christmas traditions.

==History==
Pikkujoulu is based on the [[Advent]]: the Advent signified the waiting for [[Jesus Christ]] and the [[fasting]], which ended on Christmas. In the 19th century, the Advent was sometimes called "the little Christmas", i.e. Pikkujoulu. The tradition originates from [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]] in the 1800s, before being taken up by Finnish students.&lt;ref&gt; South Africans in Finland [http://africansinfinland.tdv.co/2011/12/christmas-in-finland-pikkujoulu/ Christmas in Finland: Pikkujoulu],(accessed 15 May 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The proper Pikkujoulu tradition started in [[Helsinki]] after [[World War I]]. The basis for the party was "Christmas tree parties" held in [[school]]s. The supper parties held at the end of autumn by [[student nation]]s gradually formed into the modern Pikkujoulu. Pikkujoulu parties started by student nations grew out to other communities in the 1930s. Before [[World War II]], the parties were sometimes called "porridge parties".

The private family Pikkujoulu is probably based on a tradition stating that the [[nameday]] of Tuomas, 21 December, is the first day when tasting home-made [[beer]] is allowed. In [[Sweden]], the Tuomas nameday evening is called ''Lilla jul'' ("little Christmas"). In time, the tradition evolved to the [[Saint Lucy's Day]] celebration, which still resembles the Finnish Pikkujoulu.

The '''Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav''' (formerly known as the '''Sawai Gandharva Sangeet Mahotsav'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_sawai-gandharva-mahotsav-renamed_1614706 |title=Sawai Gandharva Mahotsav renamed – Mumbai – DNA |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and simply known as '''Sawai''') is an annual [[Hindustani Classical Music|Indian Classical music]] festival held in [[Pune]] since 1953. The festival is hosted by the Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal (ASPM) and initiated by [[Bhimsen Joshi]] as a memorial music conference commemorating the life and work of Joshi's [[guru]], [[Sawai Gandharva]], the festival's [[namesake]].

While Joshi was leading the organisation of the festival, performing artists received personal invitations from him to perform at it. With an emphasis on [[Hindustani Classical music|Hindustani Classical]] [[Khayal|Khayal music]], instrumentalists, [[Indian Classical dance|dancers]], [[dhrupad]]iyas, [[Bhajans|Bhakti musicians]], [[Ghazal|Ghazal musicians]], [[Qawwali]]yas, and [[Carnatic music]]ians frequent the concert lineup.

A younger artist's debut performance at the festival connotes their "arrival" and promise to the Classical music scene of India (most recently including [[Rahul Deshpande]], [[Kaushiki Chakrabarty]], and [[Mahesh Kale]]).

Since its inception, the festival has grown into a prominent cultural soiree for Pune's musical connoisseurs, featuring the foremost musicians of traditional Indian musical forms.

==History==
The festival was started in 1953 on a small scale, to commemorate the first death anniversary of [[Sawai Gandharva]], the acclaimed Hindustani Classical vocalist of the [[Kirana Gharana]].

Bhimsen Joshi led the organisation of the festival from its beginning until 2002 when his health problems became of concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/10/31/stories/2002103100070100.htm |title=Still magical |publisher=The Hindu |date=31 October 2002 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joshi's youngest son, [[Shrinivas Joshi]], and senior disciple, [[Shrikant Deshpande]], succeeded him as organisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=Times News Network |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/Pune/Sawai_Gandharva_music_fest_to_start_from_Dec_11/articleshow/3753056.cms |title=Sawai Gandharva music fest to start from Dec 11 – The Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=25 November 2008 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Joshi's death in 2011, Shrinivas Joshi and [[Anand Deshmukh]] have been the main organisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/This-year-on--Sawai-will-be-Sawai-Gandharva-Bhimsen-Mahotsav/877938/ |title=This year on, Sawai will be Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav |publisher=Indian Express |date=19 November 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent years==
The 2009 Festival was postponed to January 2010 due to an [[H1N1]] scare in Pune.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Sawai-Gandharva-festival-postponed/articleshow/5158117.cms|title=Sawai Gandharva festival postponed|date=25 October 2009|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sawai-gandharva-festival-to-be-held-from-jan/536810/ Sawai Gandharva Festival to be held from January] ''Indian Express''.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy rain on 13 December 2014 caused the festival to be postponed until 1 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sakaaltimes.com/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=5760929664306349337&amp;SectionId=4924098573178130559&amp;SectionName=Top%20Stories&amp;NewsTitle=Sawai%20Mahotsav%20postponed|title=Sawai Mahotsav postponed - Sakal Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Bhimsen Joshi died on 24 January 2011, the ASPM decided to rename the festival from its original name of 'Sawai Gandharva Mahotsav' to 'Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav' in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-19/pune/30418905_1_kirana-gharana-pt-bhimsen-joshi-festival | work=The Times of India | title=Music fest renamed Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav | date=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tradition==
The Sawai Gandharva Music Festival is conducted every year in the first two weeks of December over three days. In the past, the festival runs through whole the night and the days used to end in the morning. Later on, when [[Pune Municipal Corporation]] set rule to finish the program before 10&amp;nbsp;pm which leads to change in the schedule of the program. Traditionally, each festival is inaugurated with a tribute honoring [[Sawai Gandharva]], with a [[Shehnai]] musician performing first, in the early morning. During the first two days, programs begin in the late-afternoon and are supposed to officially end by 10&amp;nbsp;pm. On the third and final day (previously a Saturday, now usually a Sunday), the programme is conducted in two sessions, the first beginning in the early morning continuing until the early afternoon, the second session begins in the early evening and ends at 10 p.m.

===Finale performances===
Tradition was that the finale performance was presented by Bhimsen Joshi. Since his retirement, other members of the Kirana Gharana took on the role, including [[Sangmeshwar Gurav]] in 2005 and leading disciples of Joshi in 2006. The vocalist Prabha Atre has concluded every festival since 2007.

The festival officially concludes with the entire audience and remaining performers listening to the [[Thumri]] [[Bhairavi|in Raag Bhairavi]] recording "Jamuna Ke Teer" by [[Sawai Gandharva]], a tune made famous by and signature of his guru, Abdul Karim Khan.

==List of festivals and performances==
The Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal takes the task of recording details of the festival each year. The festival has been recorded in picture, video and audio, some of which is commercially available. Festivals are listed counter-chronologically.

'''Sexual slavery''' and '''sexual exploitation''' is attaching the right of ownership over one or more persons with the intent of [[coercing]] or otherwise forcing them to engage in one or more [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]].&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Jackie |last1=Jones |first2=Anna |last2=Grear |first3=Rachel Anne |last3=Fenton |first4=Kim |last4=Stevenson|title=Gender, Sexualities and Law|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1136829239|year=2011|page=203|accessdate=28 October 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3erAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malekian"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Farhad |last1=Malekian |first2=Kerstin |last2=Nordlöf|title=Prohibition of Sexual Exploitation of Children Constituting Obligation Erga Omnes|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1443868532|year=2014|page=211|accessdate=28 October 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oC1QBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes [[forced labor]], reducing a person to a servile status (including [[forced marriage]]) and [[Sex trafficking|sex trafficking persons]], such as the [[Child prostitution|sexual trafficking of children]].&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;

Sexual slavery may also involve single-owner sexual [[slavery]]; [[ritual slavery]], sometimes associated with certain religious practices, such as [[ritual servitude]] in [[Ghana]], [[Togo]] and [[Benin]]; slavery for primarily non-sexual purposes but where non-consensual sexual activity is common; or [[forced prostitution]]. [[Concubinage]] was a traditional form of sexual slavery in many cultures, in which women spent their lives in sexual servitude. In some cultures, concubines and their children had distinct rights and legitimate social positions.

The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] calls for an international effort to eradicate sexual slavery as an abuse of [[human rights]]. The incidence of sexual slavery by country has been studied and tabulated by [[UNESCO]], with the cooperation of various international agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/culture/Trafficking/project/Graph_Worldwide_Sept_2004.pdf UNESCO Trafficking Project]. unescobkk.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Definitions==
The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute (1998)]] (which defines the crimes over which the [[International Criminal Court]] may have jurisdiction) encompasses [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]] (Article 7) which include "enslavement" (Article 7.1.c) and "sexual enslavement" (Article 7.1.g) "when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population". It also defines sexual enslavement as a [[war crime]] and a breach of the [[Geneva Conventions]] when committed during an international armed conflict (Article 8.b.xxii) and indirectly in an internal armed conflict under Article(8.c.ii), but the courts jurisdiction over war crimes is explicitly excluded from including crimes committed during "situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar nature" (Article 8.d).&lt;ref name=Rome-Statute&gt;{{Citation |chapter=Articles 7 and 8 |url=http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm |title=Rome Statute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the Rome Statute does not explicitly define sexual enslavement, but does define enslavement as "the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person and includes the exercise of such power in the course of trafficking in persons, in particular women and children" (Article 7.2.c).&lt;ref name=Rome-Statute/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However the elements of the crime of sexual enslavement are described in more detail in a separate document originating from Article 9 of the Rome Statute: "General introduction 1. Pursuant to article 9 [of the Rome Statute], the following Elements of Crimes shall assist the Court in the interpretation and application of articles 6, 7 and 8, consistent with the Statute" (Article 1 of the Elements of the Crime). They are found in a paragraphs entitled "Article 7 (1) (g)-2 Crime against humanity of sexual slavery"; "Article 8 (2) (b) (xxii)-2 War crime of sexual slavery"; and "Article 8 (2) (e) (vi)-2 War crime of sexual slavery". The same wording is used in all three paragraphs ({{Citation |url=http://www.iclklamberg.com/Elements.htm#Article%207%281%29%28g%29-2 |title=Elements of Crime |chapter=Article 7 (1) (g)-2 Crime against humanity of sexual slavery |publisher=International Criminal Law Database &amp; Commentary |accessdate=1 April 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509232341/http://www.iclklamberg.com/Elements.htm#Article%207%281%29%28g%29-2 |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }})
{{quote|
;Elements
# The perpetrator exercised any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over one or more persons, such as by purchasing, selling, lending or bartering such a person or persons, or by imposing on them a similar deprivation of liberty.
# The perpetrator caused such person or persons to engage in one or more acts of a sexual nature.
# The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with an international armed conflict.
# The perpetrator was aware of factual circumstances that established the existence of an armed conflict.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the commentary on the Rome Statute,&lt;ref&gt;Commentaries on treaties explain why certain words and phrases appeared in a treaty and what the delegates considered when agreeing to the words and phrases used.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Klamberg]] states:&lt;ref name="iclklamberg.com"&gt;{{Citation| title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |publisher=International Criminal Law Database &amp; Commentary |page= footnotes: [http://www.iclklamberg.com/Statute.htm#_ftn29 29], 82, 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="juridicas.unam.mx"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/publica/librev/rev/iidh/cont/39/pr/pr7.pdf |title=The Rome Statute's Sexual Related Crimes: an Appraisal under the Light of International Humanitarian Law|journal=Revista Instituto Interamericano de Derechos Humanos|volume=1|issue=39|pages=29–30 |format=PDF |accessdate=8 July 2012|date=January 2004|last1=Acuña|first1=Tathiana Flores}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Sexual slavery is a  particular form of enslavement which includes limitations on one's autonomy, freedom of movement and power to decide matters relating to one's sexual activity. Thus, the crime also includes [[forced marriage]]s, domestic servitude or other forced labor that ultimately involves forced sexual activity. In contrast to the crime of rape, which is a completed offence, sexual slavery constitutes a continuing offence. ... Forms of sexual slavery can, for example, be practices such as the detention of women in "rape camps" or "comfort stations", forced temporary "marriages" to soldiers and other practices involving the treatment of women as chattel, and as such, violations of the peremptory norm prohibiting slavery.}}

===Commercial sexual exploitation of adults===
{{Main article|Sex trafficking}}
Commercial sexual exploitation of adults (often referred to as "sex trafficking")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemke|first=Melinda Anne|date=2015|title=Politics, policy, and normative state culture: Texas trafficking policy and education as a medium for social change|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/32791|journal=Dissertation|volume=|pages=2|via=University of Texas Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[human trafficking]] involving the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of people, by coercive or abusive means for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Commercial sexual exploitation is not the only form of human trafficking and estimates vary as to the percentage of human trafficking which is for the purpose of transporting someone into sexual slavery.

The [[BBC News]] cited a report by [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]] as listing the most common destinations for victims of human trafficking in 2007 as Thailand, Japan, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the US. The report lists Thailand, China, Nigeria, Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine as major sources of trafficked persons.&lt;ref name="BBC-UN-traffic"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=UN highlights human trafficking | date=26 March 2007 | accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial sexual exploitation of children===
{{main article|Commercial sexual exploitation of children}}
Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) includes [[child prostitution]] (or child sex trafficking), [[child sex tourism]], [[child pornography]], or other forms of transactional sex with children. The Youth Advocate Program International (YAPI) describes CSEC as a form of [[coercion]] and [[violence]] against children and a contemporary form of [[slavery]].&lt;ref name="yapi.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yapi.org/csec/ |title=Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) and Child Trafficking|publisher=Youth Advocate Program International |accessdate=8 July 2012|date=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clift&gt;{{cite book|title=Tourism and Sex |author= Stephen Clift |author2=Simon Carter |publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA |year=2000 |pages=75–78 |isbn=978-1-85567-636-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A declaration of the World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm in 1996, defined CSEC as, "sexual abuse by the adult and remuneration in cash or in kind to the child or to a third person or persons. The child is treated as a sexual object and as a commercial object".&lt;ref name=clift/&gt;

In some parts of the world, child prostitution is tolerated or ignored by the authorities. Reflecting an attitude which prevails in many developing countries, a judge from Honduras said, on condition of anonymity: "If the victim [the child prostitute] is older than 12, if he or she refuses to file a complaint and if the parents clearly profit from their child's commerce, we tend to look the other way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_10/issue_07/travel_01.html |title=Child prostitution: the ugliest part of tourism |publisher=Thepanamanews.com |accessdate=8 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625130547/http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_10/issue_07/travel_01.html |archivedate=25 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most, if not all, forms of forced prostitution may be viewed as a kind of sexual slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes: ''nullum crimen sine lege'' and the subject matter jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6QjrSHfoEiAC&amp;pg=PA514 |author=Machteld Boot |publisher=Intersentia nv |year=2002 |isbn=978-90-5095-216-3 |page=514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "forced prostitution" and "enforced prostitution" appear in international and humanitarian conventions but have been insufficiently understood and inconsistently applied. "Forced prostitution" generally refers to conditions of control over a person who is coerced by another to engage in sexual activity.&lt;ref name="Reportof1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/0/3d25270b5fa3ea998025665f0032f220?OpenDocument |title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on systemic rape |date=22 June 1998 |accessdate=10 November 2009 |publisher=The United Nations Commission on Human Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112211407/http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/0/3d25270b5fa3ea998025665f0032f220?OpenDocument |archivedate=12 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of consent in prostitution is hotly debated. Opinion in places such as Europe has been divided over the question of whether prostitution should be considered as a free choice or as inherently exploitative of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/221703 |title=Spain divided over semi-legal prostitution |publisher=Digitaljournal.com |date=29 August 2007 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law in Sweden, Norway and Iceland – where it is illegal to pay for sex, but not to sell sexual services – is based on the notion that all forms of prostitution are inherently exploitative, opposing the notion that prostitution can be voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.pla.qld.gov.au/Resources/PLA/reportsPublications/documents/THE%20BAN%20ON%20PURCHASING%20SEX%20IN%20SWEDEN%20-%20THE%20SWEDISH%20MODEL.pdf |title=The Ban on Purchasing Sex in Sweden: The So-Called 'Swedish Model' |author=Bob Wallace |publisher=Office of the Prostitution Licensing Authority |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, prostitution is a recognized profession in countries such as the Netherlands and Germany.

In 1949 the [[UN General Assembly]] adopted the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]] (the 1949 Convention). The 1949 Convention supersedes a number of earlier conventions that covered some aspects of forced prostitution. Signatories are charged with three obligations under the 1949 Convention: prohibition of trafficking, specific administrative and enforcement measures, and social measures aimed at trafficked persons. The 1949 Convention presents two shifts in perspective of the trafficking problem in that it views prostitutes as victims of the procurers, and in that it eschews the terms "white slave traffic" and "women," using for the first time race- and gender-neutral language.&lt;ref name=entrepreneur&gt;Kathryn E.

''Houston Journal of International Law''&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of the 1949 Convention provides punishment for any person who "[p]rocures, entices or leads away, for purposes of prostitution, another person" or "[e]xploits the prostitution of another person, even with the consent of that person." To fall under the provisions of the 1949 Convention, the trafficking need not cross international lines.&lt;ref name=entrepreneur/&gt;

Bride kidnapping, also known as marriage by abduction or marriage by captive, is a form of forced [[marriage]] practised in some traditional cultures. Bride kidnapping has reportedly occurred in countries spanning [[Central Asia]], [[Caucasus|the Caucasus region]], parts of [[Africa]], and among the [[Hmong people|Hmong]] in southeast Asia, the [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]] in Mexico, and the [[Romani people|Romani]] in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Though the motivations behind bride kidnapping vary by region, the cultures with traditions of marriage by abduction are generally [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] with a strong [[social stigma]] against sex or pregnancy outside marriage and [[illegitimacy|illegitimate births]].&lt;ref name=stross&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brian Stross|title=Tzeltal Marriage by Capture|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|volume=47|issue=3|pages=328–346|doi=10.2307/3316984|jstor=3316984|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabina Kiryashova, [http://www.iwpr.net/?p=wpr&amp;s=f&amp;o=258105&amp;apc_state=henpwp ''Azeri Bride Kidnappers Risk Heavy Sentences'']; Gulo Kokhodze &amp; Tamuna Uchidze, [http://www.iwpr.net/?p=crs&amp;s=f&amp;o=321627&amp;apc_state=henh ''Bride Theft Rampant in Southern Georgia''], where "great social stigma attaches to the suspicion of lost virginity.".

("There is no relationship between bride theft and status distinctions, bride price, or attitudes toward premarital virginity. The absence of strong associations in these areas suggests the need for a new hypothesis.".)&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, however, the men who resort to capturing a wife are often of lower [[social status]], whether because of poverty, disease, poor character or criminality. In some cases, the couple collude together to elope under the guise of a bride kidnapping, presenting their parents with a fait accompli.&lt;ref name=stross/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Scott, ''The Migrants Without Mountains: The Sociocultural Adjustment Among the Lao Hmong Refugees In San Diego'' (Ann Arbor, MI: A Bell And Howell Company, 1986), pp. 82–85 (Hmong culture); Alex Rodriguez, ''Kidnapping a Bride Practice Embraced in Kyrgyzstan'', ''Augusta Chronicle'', 24 July 2005 (Kyrgyz culture);&lt;/ref&gt; These men are sometimes deterred from legitimately seeking a wife because of the payment the woman's family expects, the [[bride price]] (not to be confused with a [[dowry]], paid ''by'' the woman's family).&lt;ref name=stross /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig S.

Bride kidnapping is distinguished from ''raptio'' in that the former refers to the abduction of one woman by one man (and/or his friends and relatives), and is often a widespread and ongoing practice. The latter refers to the large-scale abduction of women by groups of men, most frequently in a time of war (see also [[war rape]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The Latin term ''raptio'' refers to abduction of women, either for marriage (by [[kidnapping]] or [[elopement]]) or [[enslavement]] (particularly sexual slavery). In [[Roman Catholic]] [[canon law]], ''raptio'' refers to the legal prohibition of [[matrimony]] if the bride was abducted forcibly (Canon 1089 [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|CIC]]).

The practice of ''raptio'' is surmised to have existed since anthropological antiquity. In [[Neolithic Europe]], excavation of a [[Linear Pottery culture]] site at [[Asparn an der Zaya|Asparn-Schletz]], [[Austria]], unearthed the remains of numerous slain victims. Among them, young adult females and children were clearly under-represented, suggesting that perhaps the attackers had killed the men but abducted the young females.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhauer, U., ''Kulturwandel und Innovationsprozess: Die fünf grossen 'W' und die Verbreitung des Mittelneolithikums in Südwestdeutschland.'' Archäologische Informationen 22, 1999, 215–239; an alternative interpretation is the focus of [[abduction of children]] rather than women, a suggestion also made for the mass grave excavated at Thalheim.

{{Main article|Prostitution in ancient Greece}}
Employing female and occasionally male slaves for prostitution was common in the Hellenistic and Roman world. Ample references exist in literature, law, military reports and art. A prostitute (slave or free) existed outside the moral codex restricting sexuality in Greco-Roman society and enjoyed little legal protection.

During the 1662 [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] in which Chinese [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] loyalist forces commanded by [[Koxinga]] besieged and defeated the [[Dutch East India Company]] and conquered Taiwan, the Chinese took Dutch women and children prisoner. The Dutch missionary [[Antonius Hambroek]], two of his daughters, and his wife were among the Dutch prisoners of war with Koxinga. Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia demanding he persuade them to surrender or else Hambroek would be killed when he returned. Hambroek returned to the Fort, where two of his other daughters were. He urged the Fort not to surrender, and returned to Koxinga's camp. He was then executed by decapitation, and in addition to this, a rumor was spreading among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese, so Koxinga ordered the mass execution of Dutch male prisoners in retaliation, in addition to a few women and children also being killed. The surviving Dutch women and children were then turned into slaves. Koxinga took Hambroek's teenage daughter as a concubine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Samuel H.

In contrast to the [[Atlantic slave trade]] where the male-female ratio was 2:1 or 3:1, the Arab slave trade usually had a higher female:male ratio instead, suggesting a general preference for female slaves. [[Concubinage]] and reproduction served as incentives for importing female slaves (often European), though many were also imported mainly for performing household tasks.&lt;ref name="Ehud1998"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slavery and abolition in the Ottoman Middle East|author=Ehud R.

===White slavery===
In English-speaking countries in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the phrase "white slavery" was used to refer to sexual enslavement of white women. It was particularly associated with accounts of women enslaved in Middle Eastern [[harem]]s, such as the so-called [[Circassian beauties]].&lt;ref&gt;Linda Frost, ''Never one nation: freaks, savages, and whiteness in U.S. popular culture, 1850–1877'', University of Minnesota Press, 2005, pp. 68–88.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase gradually came to be used as a euphemism for prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;In the US this usage became prominent around 1909: "a group of books and pamphlets appeared announcing a startling claim: a pervasive and depraved conspiracy was at large in the land, brutally trapping and seducing American girls into lives of enforced prostitution, or 'white slavery.' These white slave narratives, or white-slave tracts, began to circulate around 1909." Mark Thomas Connelly, ''The Response to Prostitution in the Progressive Era'', University of North Carolina Press, 1980, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was especially common in the context of the exploitation of minors, with the implication that children and young women in such circumstances were not free to decide their own fates.

[[File:The White Slave statue.jpg|thumb|left|Statue entitled ''The White Slave'' by [[Abastenia St. Leger Eberle]], a controversial sculpture meant to depict modern western sexual enslavement]]
In [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], campaigning journalist [[William Thomas Stead]], editor of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', procured a 13-year-old girl for £5, an amount then equal to a labourer's monthly wage (''see'' the [[Eliza Armstrong case]]). [[Moral panic]] over the "traffic in women" rose to a peak in England in the 1880s. At the time, "white slavery" was a natural target for defenders of public morality and crusading journalists. The ensuing outcry led to the passage of antislavery legislation in Parliament. Parliament passed the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885|1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act]], raising the [[age of consent]] from thirteen to sixteen in that year.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Adeams, "The Straight Dope: [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1302/was-there-really-such-a-thing-as-white-slavery Was there really such a thing as "white slavery"?]" 15 January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent scare occurred in the United States in the early twentieth century, peaking in 1910, when [[Chicago]]'s [[U.S. attorney]] announced (without giving details) that an international crime ring was abducting young girls in Europe, importing them, and forcing them to work in Chicago [[brothel]]s. These claims, and the [[Moral panic|panic]] they inflamed, led to the passage of the United States [[Mann Act|White-Slave Traffic Act]] of 1910, generally known as the "Mann Act". It also banned the interstate transport of females for immoral purposes. Its primary intent was to address prostitution and immorality.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Adams, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration inspectors at [[Ellis Island]] in New York City were held responsible for questioning and screening European prostitutes from the U.S. Immigration inspectors expressed frustration at the ineffectiveness of questioning in determining if a European woman was a prostitute, and claimed that many were "lying" and "framing skillful responses" to their questions. They were also accused of negligence should they accept a fictitious address from an immigrant or accept less-than-complete responses. Inspector Helen Bullis investigated several homes of assignment in the Tenderloin district of New York, and found brothels existed in the early 20th century in New York City. She compiled a list of houses of prostitutes, their proprietors, and their "inmates".&lt;ref name="Moloney2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deirdre M.

In a report by the Commissioner General of Immigration in 1914, the Commissioner said that many prostitutes would intentionally marry American men to secure citizenship. He said that for prostitutes, it was "no difficult task to secure a disreputable citizen who will marry a prostitute" from Europe.

From the beginning of African slavery in the North American colonies, white men took enslaved African women as concubines or occasional mistresses. As populations increased, slave women might be taken advantage of by white overseers, planter's younger sons before they married, and other white men associated with the slaveholders. Some were sold into brothels outright.

''[[Plaçage]]'', a formalized system of concubinage among slave women or [[free people of color]], developed in Louisiana and particularly New Orleans by the 18th century. Young mixed-race women (considered highly desirable) would receive a dowry or property as part of an associated settlement negotiated by their mothers with white men. The fathers would often pay for education of their mixed-race children born of these unions, especially sons, who might be educated in France and enter the army. In recent years, at least three historians (''viz.'' Kenneth Aslakson, Emily Clark, and Carol Schlueter) have challenged the [[historicity]] of quadroon balls and have referred to the institution of Plaçage as "a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedracestudies.org/wordpress/?tag=quadroon-balls|title=Mixed Race Studies   » quadroon balls|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stacy-parker-aab/quadroons-for-beginners-d_b_3869605.html|title=Quadroons for Beginners: Discussing the Suppressed and Sexualized History of Free Women of Color with Author Emily Clark - Huffington Post|first1=Stacy Parker Le Melle Communications Director for the Afghan Women's Writing|last1=Project|first2=Author of 'Government Girl:|last2=Young|first3=Female in the White|last3=House'|date=4 September 2013|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Paul Heinegg's research showed that most mixed-race, [[free people of color|free black]] families in the censuses of 1790–1810 were descended from unions between free white women and African men, whether free, indentured servant or slave, that took place in colonial Virginia. It had half the slaves in the colonies at the time of the Revolution. In the early colonial years, the working class of indentured servants and slaves often worked and lived together.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1995–2005&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 17th century, Virginia and other colonies passed laws determining the social status of children born in the colonies. Under English common law in England, children of two English subjects took the status of the father. But Africans were never considered English subjects. To settle the issue of the status of children born in the colony, Virginia passed a law in 1662 that ruled that children would take the status of their mother at birth, under the Roman legal principle known as ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]].'' Thus all children born to enslaved mothers were legally slaves, regardless of the paternity or ancestry of their fathers. They were bound for life and could be sold like any slave unless formally freed.

The term "white slaves" was sometimes used for those [[mixed-race]] or mulatto slaves who had a visibly high proportion of European ancestry. Among the most notable at the turn of the 19th century was [[Sally Hemings]], who was 3/4 white and believed by historians to be a half sister of [[Martha Jefferson|Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson]] by their common father [[John Wayles]]. Hemings is known for having four surviving children from her decades-long concubinage with President [[Thomas Jefferson]]; they were 7/8 European by ancestry. Three of these mixed-race children passed easily into white society as adults (Jefferson freed them all – two informally and two in his will). Three of his Hemings grandsons served as white men in the Union Regular Army in the American Civil War; [[John Wayles Jefferson]] advanced to the rank of colonel.

Not all white fathers abandoned their slave children; some provided them with education, apprenticeships, or capital; some wealthy planters sent their mixed-race children to the North for education and sometimes for freedom. Some men freed both their slave mistresses and their mixed-race children, especially in the 20 years after the American Revolution, but southern legislatures made such manumissions more difficult. Both [[Mary Chesnut]] and [[Fanny Kemble]] wrote in the 19th century about the scandal of white men having their mistresses and natural [[mixed-race]] children as part of their extended households. Numerous mixed-race families were begun before the Civil War, and many originated in the Upper South.

After slaves were emancipated, many states passed [[anti-miscegenation laws]], which prohibited [[interracial marriage]] between whites and non-whites. But this did not stop white men from taking sexual advantage of black women by using their social positions of power under the [[Jim Crow]] system and [[white supremacy]], or in other parts of the country by ordinary power and wealth dynamics. For instance, in the 20th century future politician [[Strom Thurmond]] at age 21 had a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old maid in his parents' household and she became pregnant. He did provide support for their daughter. The girl was officially raised by her maternal aunt and uncle, not learning about her biological parents until she was in her late teens. She met Thurmond, but said nothing publicly about her status as his daughter until after Thurmond's death. With his family's agreement, her name has been added as one of his children on his memorial.

[[Zora Neale Hurston]] wrote about contemporary sexual practices in her [[Anthropology|anthropological]] studies in the 1930s of the turpentine camps of North [[Florida]]. She noted that white men with power often forced black women into sexual relationships.

Although she never named the practice as "paramour rights," author C. Arthur Ellis ascribed this term to the fictionalized Hurston in his book, ''Zora Hurston and the Strange Case of Ruby McCollum.''&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. Arthur (Jr.). ''Zora Hurston And The Strange Case Of Ruby McCollum'' (Chattanooga, TN: Gadfly Publishing, 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-9820940-0-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same character asserted that the death knell of paramour rights was sounded by the trial of [[Ruby McCollum]], a black woman who murdered Dr. C. Leroy Adams, in [[Live Oak, Florida]], in 1952. She said he had forced her into sex and bearing his child. Journalist Hurston covered McCollum's trial in 1952 for the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]''. McCollum's case was further explored in the 2015 documentary [[You Belong to Me: Sex, Race and Murder in the South]].

===During the Second World War===

====Germany during World War II====
{{main article|German military brothels in World War II|German camp brothels in World War II}}
During World War II, Germany established brothels in [[Nazi concentration camps]] ([[Lagerbordell]]). The women forced to work in these brothels came from the [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Askin|Askin]], 72&lt;/ref&gt; Soldier's brothels ([[Wehrmachtsbordell]]) were usually organized in already established brothels or in hotels confiscated by the Germans. The leaders of the Wehrmacht became interested in running their own brothels when sexual disease spread among the soldiers. In the controlled brothels, the women were checked frequently to avoid and treat [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmittable infections]] (STI).

It is estimated that a minimum of 34,140 women from occupied states were forced to work as prostitutes during the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref name="Herbermann"&gt;Nanda Herbermann (2000) ''The Blessed Abyss: Inmate #6582 in Ravensbruck Concentration Prison for Women''. Wayne State University Press, {{ISBN|0814329209}}&lt;/ref&gt; In occupied Europe, the local women were often forced into prostitution. On 3 May 1941 the Foreign Ministry of the [[Polish government-in-exile]] issued a document describing the mass Nazi raids made in Polish cities with the goal of capturing young women, who later were forced to work in brothels used by German soldiers and officers. Women often tried to escape from such facilities, with at least one mass escape known to have been attempted by women in [[Norway]].

"Comfort women" are a widely publicised example of sexual slavery. The term refers to the women, from occupied countries, who were forced to serve as sex slaves in the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Imperial Japanese Army|army's]] camps during [[World War II]]. Estimates vary as to how many women were involved, with numbers ranging from as low as 20,000 from some Japanese scholars&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="AWF_CW" /&gt; --&gt; to as high as 410,000 from some Chinese scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W2nU1Xu0XdkC&amp;pg=PA88 |title=Sino-Japanese Relations: Facing the Past, Looking to the Future? |author=Caroline Rose |page= 88 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=31 August 2004|isbn=9780203644317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers are still being researched and debated.

The {{nihongo|Recreation and Amusement Association|特殊慰安施設協会|''Tokushu Ian Shisetsu Kyōkai'' (Special Comfort Facility Association)}} (RAA) was the largest of the organizations established by the [[Occupied Japan|Japanese government]] to provide organized [[prostitution]] and other leisure facilities for occupying Allied troops immediately following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nicholas Kristof|title=Fearing G.I.

The RAA established its first brothel on 28 August: the Komachien in [[Ōmori]]. By December 1945, the RAA owned 34 facilities, 16 of which were "comfort stations". The total number of prostitutes employed by the RAA amounted to 55,000 at its peak.

The dispersal of prostitution made it harder for GHQ to control STIs and also caused an increase in rapes by GIs, from an average of 40 a day before the SCAP order to an estimated 330 per day immediately after.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===During the Korean War===
{{Main article|Prostitutes in South Korea for the U.S. military}}

During the [[Korean War]], the South Korean military institutionalized a "special comfort unit" similar to the one used by the Japanese military during World War II, kidnapping and pressing several North Korean women into sexual slavery. Until recently, very little was known about this apart from testimonies of retired generals and soldiers who had fought in the war. In February 2002, Korean sociologist [[Kim Kwi-ok]] wrote the first scholarly work on Korea's comfort women through official records.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Soh|Soh]], 347&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Korean "comfort" system was organized around three operations. First, there were "special comfort units" called T'uksu Wiandae (특수위안대, 特殊慰安隊), which operated from seven different stations. Second, there were mobile units of comfort women that visited barracks. Third, there were prostitutes who worked in private brothels that were hired by the military. Although it is still not clear how recruitment of these comfort women were organized in the South, South Korean agents were known to have kidnapped some of the women from the North.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Soh|Soh]], 215&lt;/ref&gt;

According to anthropologist [[Chunghee Sarah Soh]], the South Korean military's use of comfort women has produced "virtually no societal response," despite the country's women's movement's support for Korean comfort women within the Japanese military. Both Kim and Soh argue that this system is a legacy of Japanese colonialism, as many of Korea's army leadership were trained by the Japanese military. Both the Korean and Japanese militaries referred to these comfort women as "military supplies" in official documents and personal memoirs. The South Korean armed forces also used the same arguments as the Japanese military to justify the use of comfort women, viewing them as a "necessary social evil" that would raise soldiers' morale and prevent rape.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Soh|Soh]], 216&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==
Official estimates of individuals in sexual slavery worldwide vary. In 2001 the [[International Organization for Migration]] estimated 400,000, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] estimated 700,000 and [[UNICEF]] estimated 1.75 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/slaves/etc/stats.html Sex Slaves: Estimating Numbers], [[Public Broadcasting System]] "Frontline" fact site.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 the United States State Department estimated that 50,000 to 100,000 women and girls are trafficked each year into the United States. In 2003, the State Department report estimated that a total of 18,000 to 20,000 individuals were trafficked into the United States for either forced labor or sexual exploitation.

The Girl’s Education &amp; Mentoring Services (GEMS), an organization based in New York, claims that the majority of girls in the sex trade were abused as children. Poverty and a lack of education play major roles in the lives of many women in the sex industry.

According to a report conducted by the University of Pennsylvania, anywhere from 100,000 up to 300,000 American children at any given time may be at risk of exploitation due to factors such as drug use, homelessness, or other factors connected with increased risk for commercial sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name="penn"&gt;[http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/~restes/CSEC_Files/Exec_Sum_020220.pdf Microsoft Word – Exec_Sum_020220.doc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002000344/http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/~restes/CSEC_Files/Exec_Sum_020220.pdf |date=2 October 2008 }}.

Sex trafficking in the United States may be present in Asian [[massage parlors]], Mexican [[cantina]] bars, residential brothels, or street-based [[pimp]]-controlled prostitution. The anti-trafficking community in the United States is debating the extent of sexual slavery. Some groups argue that exploitation is inherent in the act of [[commercial sex]], while other groups take a stricter approach to defining sexual slavery, considering an element of force, fraud or coercion to be necessary for sex slavery to exist.

Once in Pakistan they are taken to brothels (called ''kharabat'') and forced into sexual slavery, some for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID={32A1A7A6-6D7F-44EE-9A34-4C59EB5CAF59} |title=FrontPage Magazine |publisher=Frontpagemag.com |date=26 June 2007 |accessdate=8 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216075151/http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=%7B32A1A7A6-6D7F-44EE-9A34-4C59EB5CAF59%7D |archivedate=16 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald G.

====East and Southeast Asia====
In January 2010, the Supreme Court of India stated that India is "becoming a hub" for large-scale child prostitution rackets. It suggested setting up of a special investigating agency to tackle the growing problem.&lt;ref name="Indiabecoming2010"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-becoming-a-hub-of-child-prostitution-SC/articleshow/5513771.cms | work=The Times of India | title=India becoming a hub of child prostitution: SC | date=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article about the Rescue Foundation in ''New Internationalist'' magazine states that "according to Save the Children India, clients now prefer 10- to 12-year-old girls". The same article attributes the rising number of prostitutes believed to have contracted [[HIV]] in India’s brothels as a factor in India becoming the country with the second-largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world, behind South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newint.org/columns/makingwaves/2006/06/02/rescue-foundation/ |title=The Rescue Foundation – New Internationalist |publisher=Newint.org |accessdate=8 July 2012|date=2006-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand, the Health System Research Institute reported in 2005 that children in prostitution make up 40% of Thailand's prostitutes.&lt;ref name="unicri.it"/&gt; It said that a proportion of prostitutes over the age of 18, including foreign nationals mostly from [[Myanmar]], China's [[Yunnan]] province, [[Laos]] and Cambodia, are also in some state of forced sexual servitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicri.it/wwd/trafficking/minors/countries.php |title=UNICRI Trafficking in Minors, Report on Thailand 2005 |accessdate=2005-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024072431/http://www.unicri.it/wwd/trafficking/minors/countries.php |archivedate=24 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1996, the police in Bangkok estimated that there were at least 5,000 Russian prostitutes working in Thailand, many of whom had arrived through networks controlled by Russian gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiapacificms.com/articles/russian_mafia/| title=The Russian Mafia in Asia - Asia Pacific Media Service|publisher=Asiapacificms.com |author=Bertil Lintner|date=3 February 1996|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tourism Police Bureau in 1997 stated that there were 500 Chinese and 200 European women in prostitution in Bangkok, many of whom entered Thailand illegally, often through Burma and Laos. Earlier reports, however, suggest different figures. (Police Colonel Sanit Meephan, deputy chief of Tourism Police Bureau, "Thailand popular haunt for foreign prostitutes", ''The Nation'', 15 January 1997)

Part of the challenge in quantifying and eliminating sexual slavery in Thailand and Asia generally is the high rate of police corruption in the region. There are documented cases where Thai and other area law enforcement officials worked with human traffickers, even to the extent of returning escaped child sex slaves to brothels.&lt;ref name="My Name Lon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharron|first1=Derek|title=My Name Lon - You Like Me?|date=2005|publisher=Bangkok Book House|location=Bangkok, Thailand|isbn=978-974-92721-5-2|pages=61...62|edition=3rd 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
[[File:Amsterdam red light district.jpg|thumb|[[De Wallen]] red-light district in Amsterdam. Most of the trafficked girls and women come from central and eastern Europe.]]
In the [[Netherlands]], the Bureau of the Dutch Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings in 2005 estimated that there are from 1,000 to 7,000 trafficking victims a year. Most police investigations relate to legal sex businesses, with all sectors of prostitution being well represented, but with window brothels being particularly overrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.bnrm.nl/search.aspx?simpleSearch=report |title=Zoeken op Bnrm English |publisher=English.bnrm.nl |accessdate=8 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629151055/http://english.bnrm.nl/search.aspx?simpleSearch=report |archivedate=29 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.bnrm.nl/reports/third/index.aspx |title=third |publisher=English.bnrm.nl |date=18 September 2007 |accessdate=8 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629152038/http://english.bnrm.nl/reports/third/index.aspx |archivedate=29 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.bnrm.nl/reports/fourth/index.aspx |title=fourth |publisher=English.bnrm.nl |date=18 September 2007 |accessdate=8 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408140041/http://english.bnrm.nl/reports/fourth/index.aspx |archivedate=8 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch news site Expatica reported that in 2008, there were 809 registered trafficking victims in the Netherlands; out of those 763 were women and at least 60 percent of them were reportedly forced to work in the [[sex industry]]. Of reported victims, those from [[Hungary]] were all female and all forced into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/Increase-in-human-trafficking-in-Netherlands_49349.html |title=Increase in human trafficking in Netherlands &lt; Dutch news &amp;#124; Expatica The Netherlands |publisher=Expatica.com |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crossroadsmag.eu/2009/02/dutch-authorities-register-809-human-trafficking-victims/ |title=Dutch authorities register 809 human trafficking victims |publisher=Crossroadsmag.eu |accessdate=8 July 2012|date=2009-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the trafficking of women from [[Eastern Europe]] is often organized by people from that same region. German authorities identified 676 sex-trafficking victims in 2008, compared with 689 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136033.htm |title=2009 Human Rights Report: Germany |publisher=State.gov |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German Federal Police Office [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]] reported in 2006 a total of 357 completed investigations of human trafficking, with 775 victims. Thirty-five percent of the suspects were Germans born in Germany and 8% were German citizens born outside Germany.&lt;ref name=bka&gt;[http://www.bka.de/lageberichte/mh.html Reports on human trafficking]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, by the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|BKA]]. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greece]], according to NGO estimates in 2008, there may be a total 13,000–14,000 trafficking victims of all types in the country at any given time. Major countries of origin for trafficking victims brought into Greece include Nigeria, Ukraine, Russia, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, Romania and Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119082.htm |title=2008 Human Rights Report: Greece |publisher=State.gov |date=25 February 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Switzerland]], the police estimated in 2006 that there may be between 1,500 and 3,000 victims of all types of human trafficking. The organizers and their victims generally come from Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine, Moldova, Lithuania, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Thailand and Cambodia, and, to a lesser extent, Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/social_affairs/detail/Swiss_sex_industry_is_thriving.html?siteSect=201&amp;sid=6770227&amp;cKey=1149319826000 |title=Prostitution in Switzerland is thriving, generating an annual turnover of SFr3.2 billion, say police|publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=3 June 2006 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Belgium]], in 2007, prosecutors handled a total of 418 trafficking cases, including 219 economic exploitation and 168 sexual exploitation cases. In the same year, the federal judicial police handled 196 trafficking files, compared with 184 in 2006. In 2007 the police arrested 342 persons for smuggling and trafficking-related crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119070.htm |title=2008 Human Rights Report: Belgium |publisher=State.gov |date=25 February 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent report by RiskMonitor foundation estimated that 70% of the prostitutes who work in Belgium are from Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Petar Kostadinov |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2009/04/07/701626_70-per-cent-of-prostitutes-in-belgium-are-from-bulgaria-report |title=70 per cent of prostitutes in Belgium are from Bulgaria – report – Bulgaria |publisher=Sofiaecho.com |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Austria, Vienna has the largest number of reported trafficking cases, although trafficking is also a problem in urban centers such as Graz, Linz, Salzburg, and Innsbruck. The NGO Lateinamerikanische Frauen in Oesterreich–Interventionsstelle fuer Betroffene des Frauenhandels (LEFOE-IBF) reported assisting 108 victims of all types of human trafficking in 2006, down from 151 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119067.htm |title=2008 Human Rights Report: Austria |publisher=State.gov |date=25 February 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Spain]], in 2007, officials identified 1,035 sex trafficking victims and 445 labor trafficking victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119106.htm |title=2008 Human Rights Report: Spain |publisher=State.gov |date=25 February 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 presidential campaign==
At the time of Hannon's hiring as campaign CTO, much commentary was made on the significance of a woman holding this position for the first time. The appointment was described as "helping open the door for other women in an industry that has long been a boys club."&lt;ref name=Aslam /&gt; The theme of transcending traditional gender roles was recently the subject of a speech by Clinton to a [[Silicon Valley]] audience, stating her intent to "crack every last glass ceiling".&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;{{cite news|last1=Epstein|first1=Jennifer|title=Hillary Clinton Explains How She'll 'Crack Every Last Glass Ceiling' in 2016|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-25/hillary-clinton-explains-how-she-ll-crack-every-last-glass-ceiling-in-2016|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Taurian Games''' (Latin '''''Ludi Taurii''''' or '''''Ludi Taurei''''', rarely '''Taurilia'''&lt;ref&gt;''Taurilia'' is an alternate reading of the relevant passage in [[Livy]], 39.22; it is included as an entry in [[Egidio Forcellini|Forcellini's ''Totius Latinitatis Lexicon'']] (1828), p. 708, and appears in some older editions of Livy and in scholarship from the 19th century. See notes in the 1825 edition of Livy by [[Arnold Drakenborch]] and [[Johann Freinsheim]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=hBpNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=%22ludi+taurii%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ds-GT4evCIWL8AHEqtWXCA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwADhQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ludi%20taurii%22&amp;f=false p. 402.]&lt;/ref&gt;) were games ''([[ludi]])'' held in [[ancient Rome]] in honor of the ''[[Di Inferi|di inferi]]'', the gods of the underworld. They were not part of a regularly scheduled [[Roman festival|religious festival]] on the [[Roman calendar|calendar]], but were held as expiatory rites ''religionis causa'', occasioned by [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#religio|religious concerns]].&lt;ref&gt;John H. Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses: Arenas for Chariot Racing'' (University of California Press, 1986), p. 543; Robert Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), p. 82. &lt;/ref&gt;

''Ludi Taurii'' are recorded in 186 BC as a two-day event.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 39.22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varro]] mentions them as occurring in the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BC - 30 BC)|late Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 5.154.&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]], they were held every five years from 140 to 160 AD, within a period beginning on the day after the [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]] of May and continuing through the [[Kalends]] of June.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' xiv supp. 4541 (the ''[[Fasti Ostienses]]''); John Briscoe, ''A Commentary on Livy, Books 38–40'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 19, 294; Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', p. 544.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars extrapolate that like the ''[[lustrum]]'' (purification ritual), the ''Ludi Taurii'' were regularly [[wikt:quinquennial|quinquennial]].&lt;ref&gt;Eckart Köhne, "Bread and Circuses: The Politics of Entertainment," in ''Gladiators and Caesars: The Power of Spectacle in Ancient Rome'' (University of California Press, 2000), p. 9; Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt; Others caution that the five-year schedule under Antoninus Pius, attested by the ''[[Fasti Ostienses]]'', is never mentioned in other sources. The limited evidence suggests the ''Ludi Taurii'' were important mainly in the context of religious revivalism during the [[Augustus|Augustan]] and [[Antonine]] eras.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''A Commentary on Livy'', p. 294; Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', pp. 543–544.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taurian Games were horse races, or less likely [[chariot races]], on a course around turning posts ''([[metae]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', p. 544; Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 5.154: "the horses run around the turning posts" ''(equi circum metas currunt)''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, they were sometimes confused with the archaic Tarentine Games ''(ludi tarentini)'', which were replaced by the [[Saecular Games]].&lt;ref&gt;In 1875 and subsequent editions, [[Leonhard Schmitz]]'s entry on the ''Ludi Saeculares'' in [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities|Smith's ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'']] ''(SMIGRA)'' identified the Taurian Games with the ''ludi tarentini''. The identification gained currency in English [[classical tradition|classicizing literary circles]], as indicated in the notes to [[Edward Lytton]]'s translation of [[Horace]]'s [[Carmen Saeculare|Saecular Ode]], published in ''Schiller and Horace'' (Routledge, 1875), pp. 423–424, citing a then-current edition of Smith's ''Dictionary''. By the 1890 edition of ''SMIGRA'', a separate entry for ''[http://artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:139.antiquities Ludi Taurii] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709151634/http://artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:139.antiquities |date=2012-07-09 }}'' had been added, with a few points of dubious factuality (see [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Ludi_Saeculares.html#noteA Bill Thayer's note] to the entry ''Ludi Saeculares'' in the [[LacusCurtius]] edition of the 1875 ''SMIGRA'', as well as his translation of and note to the entry ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/DARSAG/Taurii_Ludi.html Taurii Ludi]'' in Daremberg and Saglio, ''[[Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines]]''). The erroneous identification was nevertheless perpetuated in the ''[[Century Dictionary]]'' of 1891 (pp. 6189, 6199) and later editions. As early as 1701, however, [[Thomas Dempster]] had pointed out in his notes to the ''Antiquitatum Romanorum Corpus Absolutissimum'' of [[Johannes Rosinus]] that "many confuse the Taurian with the Saecular games, but they are in error: [the two] are entirely different" (p. 340). [[Ludwig Preller]] recognized the similarities, but suggested that the ''ludi taurii'' were performed irregularly when the Saecular Games would have been untimely; ''Römische Mythologie'' (1881), vol. 1, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Horse racing along with the [[propitiation]] of underworld gods was characteristic of "old and obscure" Roman festivals such as the [[Consualia]], the [[October Horse]], and sites in the [[Campus Martius]] such as the [[Tarentum (Campus Martius)|Tarentum]] (where the ''ludi tarentini'' originated) and the [[Trigarium]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', pp. 544, 558; Auguste Bouché-Leclercq, ''Manuel des Institutions Romaines'' (Hachette, 1886), p. 549; "Purificazione," in ''Thesaurus Cultus et Rituum Antiquorum'' (''[[Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae|LIMC]]'', 2004), p. 83. See also the [[Lusus Troiae]].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ludi Taurii'' were the only games held in the [[Circus Flaminius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 5.154; Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), 83; Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', p. 543. [[Valerius Maximus]] (1.7.4) is the only ancient source, likely erroneous, to say that the [[Plebeian Games]] were held in the Circus Flaminius, which had no track for the chariot races known to be part of these ''ludi''; see [[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the games are [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] in origin, as [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] and [[Servius]] claim, ''taurii'' probably comes from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan word]] ''tauru'', "tomb."&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', p. 544.&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the turning posts ''(metae)'' on a Roman race course was derived from Etruscan funerary monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Festus, however, offers an [[aition|etiology]] based on Latin ''taurus'', "bull."&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, ''Roman Circuses'', p. 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and significance==
In the tradition recorded by Festus,&lt;ref&gt;Festus, excerpts of Paulus, p. 479 in the edition of Lindsay.&lt;/ref&gt; the games were instituted in the [[Roman Kingdom|Regal period]] when [[Tarquinius Superbus]] was [[kings of Rome|king]]. [[Servius]] also places their origin during his reign.

Fetus explains that the games were performed in honor of the gods below ''(di inferi)''. They were established in response to an epidemic ''(magna … pestilentia)'' afflicting pregnant women, caused by the distribution of the flesh of sacrificial bulls ''(tauri)'' among the people. Servius implies that the ''pestilentia'' was [[infant mortality]]: "each delivery of the women came out badly." The remedy of the games was obtained ''ex libris fatalibus'', "from the books of the fates" (either the [[Sibylline books]]&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''A Commentary on Livy'', p. 294; Auguste Bouché-Leclercq, ''Histoire de la divination dans l'antiquité'' (Jérôme Millon, 2003 reprint, originally published 1883), p. 1024.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#disciplina Etrusca|Etruscan texts]]&lt;ref&gt;Bouché-Leclercq, ''Histoire de la divination'', p. 1024.&lt;/ref&gt;). According to Servius, the ''ludi'' took their name from the word ''taurea'', meaning a sterile sacrificial victim ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#hostia|hostia]])''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius Danielis]], note to ''Aeneid'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+2.140 2.140.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Servius gives an alternative version that credits the [[Sabines]] with instituting the games in response to the ''pestilentia'', and characterizes the transferral of the ''lues publica'' (the plague upon the people) onto sacrificial victims ''(hostiae)'' as if it were a [[scapegoat|scapegoat ritual]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 176; Servius, note to ''Aeneid'' 2.140 ''(alii ludos Taureos a Sabinis propter pestilentiam institutos dicunt, ut lues publica in has hostias verteretur)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Festus also provided an additional explanation of the name as ''taurus'' ("bull") from Varro,&lt;ref&gt;Festus, p. 478 (Lindsay).&lt;/ref&gt; preserved only in fragmentary form by the ''Codex Farnesianus''.&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe, ''A Commentary on Livy'', p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; A reconstruction dating back to [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|J.J. Scaliger]]&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--please do not change the irregular italics; see explanation after the quotation--&gt;''Sed Taurios'' ludos Varro ait vocari, quod ''eis ludis discipu''lus pendens a doctore in cr''udo corio tauri'' solitus sit inpelli, atque us''que eo inibi cogi'' docere, quoad consisteret ''atque virtu''te talorum constaret pedu''m firmitas'' (italicized text is reconstructed); in English, "Varro, however, says that the Taurian Games are so called because it was customary at the games for a student, with a boost from his instructor, to be propelled on the raw hide of a bull ''(taurus)'', and to show by the extent of his action how sound he was and how the sureness of his feet 'stuck' by virtue of his heels." ("Stick" here is used in the sense of landing a gymnastics position correctly.) See [[André Dacier]] (1826), [https://books.google.com/books?id=h9YTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA960&amp;dq=%22appellabantur+ludi%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d5uFT6btAsyDtgfepcmJCA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22appellabantur%20ludi%22&amp;f=false pp. 960–961.]&lt;/ref&gt; has been taken to mean that youths, under the direction of a coach, engaged in ritual [[gymnastics]] on a raw bull's hide, perhaps to be compared to exercises on a [[trampoline]].&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Guigniaut on Frédéric Cruezer, ''Religions de l'antiquité'' (Paris, 1851) vol. 3, p. 1122.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has not attracted wide acceptance, but would suggest that the ritual action countervails infant mortality by affirming the fitness of the youth. Ritually, landing on the bull's skin may mimic the "catching" of a safely delivered newborn.&lt;ref&gt;For more on birthing in the Roman world, see [[Midwifery#History_of_midwifery]] and the birth deities the ''[[di nixi|Nixae]]'', whose altar was located within a complex of sites associated with horse races and underworld gods in the Campus Martius.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Livy]] has a brief reference to the games as occurring in 186 BC ''per biduum'', for a period of two days, ''religionis causa'', "for the sake of religious scruple." On this occasion, the two-day ''Ludi Taurii'' preceded ten days of ''ludi'' presented by [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 189 BC)|Marcus Fulvius Nobilior]] as the result of a [[votum|vow]] in the [[Aetolian War]]. Nobilior's games are notable as the first time a beast hunt ''([[venatio]])'' was staged at Rome. At a [[textual criticism|corrupt transition]] between the two events in Livy's text, the word ''decem'' ("ten") appears, which [[Georg Wissowa]] construed as referring to the ten-member priestly [[collegium|college]] of ''[[decemviri sacris faciundis]]''; he thought these priests were likely charged with organizing the Taurian Games.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Wissowa]], ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'' (Munich, 1902), p. 388; noted also by Briscoe, ''A Commentary on Livy'', pp. 294–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier scholars have sometimes taken the adjective ''taurii'' to mean that bulls were part of the games, either in a Mediterranean tradition of [[bull-leaping]], or as an early form of [[bullfighting]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Drakenborch]] in his 1825 edition of Livy took the ''Taurilia'' as involving actual bull fights (p. 400). See also Guigniaut on Cruezer, ''Religions de l'antiquité'', p. 1122ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Livy's chronology places the ''Ludi Taurii'' (or in some editions ''Taurilia'') immediately after the news of a victory in [[Roman Spain]], the games have figured in a few efforts to trace the early history of [[Spanish-style bullfighting]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Edward Clarke, ''Letters concerning the Spanish Nation'' (London, 1763), pp. 113–115. The effort was derided by [[Charles Sumner]], "Spanish Bull-Feasts and Bull-Fights," ''Quarterly Review'' (1839), p. 385ff., published anonymously and attributed to Sumner by Edward L. Pierce, ''Memoirs and Letters of Charles Sumner'' (Boston, 1893), vol. 2, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The theater was designed in the 1860s by [[Juan Bertoli Calderoni]] (a [[List of people from Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponceño]] of [[Italian people|Italian]] heritage resident of the city) and it bears a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] structure with an impressive six-column entrance. The building was badly damaged by the [[1918 San Fermín earthquake|1918 earthquake]]. However, it was rebuilt in 1940 using the original plans and reopened in 1941 with better acoustics technology. It closed in 2006 for renovations and reopened on March 14, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsgotoponce.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=202&amp;Itemid=81 ''Grand Inauguration for Ponce’s La Perla Theater.''

==History==
Teatro La Perla was built under the initiative of [[Francisco Parra Duperón]] and Pedro Garriga in May 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Acosta  | first = Ivonne | title = Teatro La Perla  | language = Spanish | publisher = Fundación Puertorriqueña de las Humanidades | date = September 29, 2008| url = http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=06121001 | accessdate = March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was inaugurated on 28 May 1864 with the play ''La campana de la Almudaina'' of the [[Majorca]]n writer Juan Palou y Coll by the [[theatrical company]] of Segarra &amp; Argente.&lt;ref&gt;Socorro Girón.

Teatro La Perla served as a stage not only to give life to the theatrical artistic culture in the region, but it also served as a place of assembly for those who were dedicated to the social issues in Ponce and in Puerto Rico as a whole.   It served this function both at the end of the Spanish regime and in Puerto Rico’s early years as a United States territory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090831091422/http://www.tourism-puerto-rico.com/citys-and-towns/ponce/ Functional Use of the Theater]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessed 13 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kannada]] play written by Indian playwright [[Girish Karnad]]. The play has been performed many times but different groups around the world but mostly in the subcontinent and mainly in Pakistan and India. The story follows the last days as well as the historic moments in the life of the Ruler of [[Mysore]], [[Tipu Sultan]], through the eyes of an Indian court historian and a British Oriental scholar.

The figure of [[Tipu Sultan]] has continued to dominate Indian and British imagination for over two centuries,{{Who|date=August 2011}} as attested by the numerous scholarly works, ballads, plays and novels about his tempestuous life and tragic end. What is less well known,{{Who|date=August 2011}} however, is that this man, who spent a large part of his life on horseback, maintained a record of his dreams that he concealed from his nearest associates. ''The Dreams of Tipu Sultan'' examines the inner life of this warrior, political visionary, and dreamer.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The '''Vela Incident''', also known as the '''South Atlantic Flash''', was an unidentified double flash of light detected by an American [[Vela (satellite)|Vela Hotel]] satellite on 22 September 1979 near the [[Prince Edward Islands]] off Antarctica. Due to the characteristics of the light signal, along with other circumstantial evidence, it has been theorized that the flash was the result of an undeclared nuclear test carried out jointly by [[Israel–South Africa relations|South Africa and Israel]].&lt;ref name="The Bomb"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bomb – South Africa’s Nuclear Weapons Programme |first1=Nic |last1=Von Wielligh |first2=Lydia |last2=Von Wielligh-Steyn |publisher=Litera |location=Pretoria, ZA |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-920188-48-1 |oclc=930598649}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the origin of the flash was not conclusively determined, and several alternative explanations were proposed, in 2016 researchers from [[George Washington University]]'s [[National Security Archive]] noted that the debate over the origin of the South Atlantic Flash has shifted in recent years to the side of a man-made weapon test.&lt;ref name=NSArchive /&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishbusinessnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishbusinessnews.com/2016/12/09/declassified-documents-indicate-israel-and-south-africa-conducted-nuclear-test-in-1979/|title=Declassified documents indicate Israel and South Africa conducted nuclear test in 1979|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a new study claimed that it is highly likely that it was a nuclear test, conducted by Israel.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12106195|title=Researchers: Radioactive Australian sheep bolster nuclear weapon test claim against Israel|last=Johnston|first=Martin |date=2018-08-13|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Geer|first=Lars-Erik|last2=Wright|first2=Christopher M.|date=2018|title=The 22 September 1979 Vela Incident: Radionuclide and Hydroacoustic Evidence for a Nuclear Explosion|url=http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs26degeer.pdf|journal=Science &amp; Global Security|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=20–54|doi=10.1080/08929882.2018.1451050|issn=0892-9882|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a double-flash signal is characteristic of a [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons test]] in the atmosphere, it has been suggested that the signal could have been caused by a [[meteoroid]] impacting the Vela satellite.  All of the previous 41 double flashes detected by the Vela satellites were confirmed to be nuclear explosions.{{sfn|Albright|1994|p=42}}{{sfn|Ruina|1980}}{{sfn|Richelson|2006}} Some information about the event remains [[classified information|classified]].&lt;ref name=NSArchive /&gt;{{where|date=November 2018}}

== Detection ==
[[File:Vela5b.jpg|thumb|upright|Vela-5A/B Satellites in a [[clean room]]. The two satellites are separated after launch.]]
The "double flash" was detected on 22 September 1979, at 00:53 UTC, by the American [[Vela (satellite)|Vela]] satellite OPS 6911 (also known as Vela 10 and Vela 5B&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/vela_adv.htm|title=Vela 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (advanced Vela)|website=space.skyrocket.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which carried various sensors designed specifically to [[detect nuclear explosions]] that contravened the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].  In addition to being able to detect [[gamma ray]]s, [[X-ray]]s, and [[neutron]]s, the satellite also contained two silicon solid-state [[bhangmeter]] sensors that could detect the dual light flashes associated with an atmospheric nuclear explosion: the initial brief, intense flash, followed by a second, longer flash.{{sfn|Richelson|2006}}

The satellite reported the characteristic [[Effects of nuclear explosions#Blast damage|double flash]] of a small atmospheric nuclear explosion of two to three [[kiloton]]s, in the [[Indian Ocean]] between the [[Crozet Islands]] (a sparsely inhabited French possession) and the [[Prince Edward Islands]] (which belong to South Africa) at {{Coord|47|S|40|E|display=inline,title|type:landmark}}.{{sfn|''Lewiston Morning Tribune''|1979|p=25}}

Other systems data, such as [[SOund SUrveillance System|Sound Surveillance System]] (SOSUS) and Missile Impact Location System (MILS), that were established by the [[United States]] and [[NATO]] to detect Soviet submarines and the locations where used missile test warheads splashed down, respectively, was searched in an effort to gain more knowledge on the possibility of a nuclear detonation in the region. This data was found not to have enough substantial evidence of a detonation of a nuclear weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB190/|title=The Vela Incident: Nuclear Test or Meteorite?|website=nsarchive.gwu.edu|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States Air Force surveillance aircraft flew 25 [[sorties]] over that area of the [[Indian Ocean]] from 22 September to 29 October 1979 to carry out atmospheric sampling.{{sfn|USAF|1982}} Studies of wind patterns confirmed that fall-out from an explosion in the southern Indian Ocean could have been carried from there to southwestern Australia.{{sfn|Barnaby|1989|p=17}} It was reported that low levels of [[iodine-131]] (a short-half-life product of nuclear fission) were detected in sheep in the southeastern Australian States of Victoria and Tasmania soon after the event. Sheep in New Zealand showed no such trace.{{sfn|Barnaby|1989|p=17}}{{sfn|Polakow-Suransky|2010|p=139}} The [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo ionospheric observatory and radio telescope]] in [[Puerto Rico]] detected an anomalous ionospheric wave during the morning of 22 September 1979, which moved from the southeast to the northwest, an event that had not been observed previously.{{sfn|Gilinsky|2004}}

[[File:Vela Double Flash 22 Sep 1979.png|thumb|left|upright|Bhangmeter light patterns detected by a pair of sensors on Vela satellite 6911 on 22 Sep 1979.]]
After the event was made public, the United States Department of Defense clarified that it was either a bomb blast or a combination of natural phenomena, such as [[lightning]], a meteor, or a glint from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gwertzman|first1=Bernard|title=U.S. Monitors Signs of Atom Explosion Near South Africa|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/26/archives/us-monitors-signs-of-atom-explosion-near-south-africa-seeks-more.html|work=The New York Times|date=26 October 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial assessment by the [[United States National Security Council]] (NSC), with technical support by the [[Naval Research Laboratory]]{{sfn|Amato|2001|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2012}} in October 1979 was that the American intelligence community had "high confidence" that the event was a low-yield nuclear explosion, although no radioactive debris had been detected, and there was "no corroborating [[seismology|seismic]] or hydro-[[acoustics|acoustic]] data."{{sfn|National Security Council|1979|p=2}} A later NSC report revised this position to "inconclusive" about whether or not a nuclear test had occurred.&lt;ref name=nsc /&gt; That same report concluded that if a nuclear test had been carried out, responsibility should nevertheless be ascribed to the Republic of South Africa.&lt;ref name=nsc&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Intelligence Officer for Nuclear Proliferation|title=Interagency Intelligence Memorandum "The 22 September 1979 Event"|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB190/03.pdf|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|access-date=28 July 2017|page=11|date=25 January 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Office of Science and Technology evaluation ===
The [[Jimmy Carter|Carter Administration]] asked the [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] (OSTP) to convene a panel of instrumentation experts to re-examine the Vela Hotel 6911 data, and to attempt to determine whether the optical flash detected came from a nuclear test. The outcome was important to Carter, as his presidency and [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 re-election campaign]] prominently featured the themes of [[Nuclear proliferation|nuclear nonproliferation]] and disarmament.{{sfn|Weiss|2011|p=3}} The [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II]] treaty had been signed three months earlier, and was pending ratification by the [[United States Senate]],{{sfn|Weiss|2011|p=3}} and Israel and Egypt had signed the [[Camp David Accords]] six months earlier.{{r|politico20161208}}

An independent panel of scientific and engineering experts was commissioned by [[Frank Press]], who was the Science Advisor to president Carter and the chairman of the OSTP, to evaluate the evidence and determine the likelihood that the event was a nuclear detonation. The chairman of this science panel itself was [[Jack Ruina|Dr. Jack Ruina]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and also the former director of the [[U.S. Department of Defense]]'s [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]]. Reporting in the summer of 1980, the panel noted that there were some key differences in the detected optical signature from that of an actual nuclear explosion, particularly in the ratio of intensities measured by the two detectors on the satellite. The now-declassified report{{sfn|Ruina|1980}} contains details of the measurements made by the Vela Hotel satellite.

The explosion was picked up by a pair of sensors on only one of the several Vela satellites; other similar satellites were looking at different parts of the Earth, or weather conditions precluded them seeing the same event.{{sfn|Ruina|1980|p=9}} The Vela satellites had previously detected 41 atmospheric tests—by countries such as France and the [[People's Republic of China]]—each of which was subsequently confirmed by other means, including testing for [[radioactive fallout]]. The absence of any such corroboration of a nuclear origin for the Vela Incident also suggested that the "double flash" signal was a spurious "zoo" signal of unknown origin, possibly caused by the impact of a micrometeoroid.  Such "zoo" signals which mimicked nuclear explosions had been received several times earlier.{{sfn|Ruina|1980|pp=14–16, 18–19}}

Their report noted that the flash data contained "many of the features of signals from previously observed nuclear explosions",{{sfn|Ruina|1980|pp=9–11}} but that "careful examination reveals a significant deviation in the light signature of the 22 September event that throws doubt on the interpretation as a nuclear event". The best analysis that they could offer of the data suggested that, if the sensors were properly calibrated, any source of the "light flashes" were spurious "zoo events". Thus their final determination was that while they could not rule out that this signal was of nuclear origin, "based on our experience in related scientific assessments, it is our collective judgment that the September 22 signal was probably not from a nuclear explosion".{{sfn|Ruina|1980|p=19}}

Victor Gilinsky (former member of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]) argued that the science panel's findings were politically motivated.{{sfn|Gilinsky|2004}} There was some data that seemed to confirm that a nuclear explosion was the source for the "double flash" signal. There was the "anomalous" traveling ionospheric disturbance that was measured at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]] at the same time,{{sfn|Gilinsky|2004}} but many thousands of miles away in a different hemisphere of the Earth. A test in [[Western Australia]] conducted a few months later found some increased nuclear radiation levels.{{sfn|Barnaby|1989|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2012}} A detailed study done by New Zealand's National Radiation Laboratory found no evidence of excess radioactivity, and neither did a U.S. Government-funded nuclear laboratory.{{sfn|Richelson|2007|p=289}} [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] scientists who worked on the Vela Hotel program have professed their conviction that the Vela Hotel satellite's detectors worked properly.{{sfn|Gilinsky|2004}}{{sfn|Los Alamos National Laboratory – 1997}}

Leonard Weiss, at the time Staff Director of the Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Nuclear Proliferation, has also raised concerns about the findings of the Ad-Hoc Panel, arguing that it was set up by the Carter administration to counter embarrassing and growing opinion that it was an Israeli nuclear test.{{sfn|Weiss|2011|p=4}} Specific intelligence about the Israeli nuclear program was not shared with the panel whose report therefore produced the [[plausible deniability]] that the administration sought.{{sfn|Weiss|2011|p=4}}

== Possible responsible parties ==
If a nuclear explosion did occur, it occurred within the 3,000-mile-wide (4,800&amp;nbsp;km diameter) circle covering parts of the Indian Ocean, the [[Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]], the southern tip of [[Africa]], and a small part of [[Antarctica]].{{sfn|Richelson|2007|p=296}}

=== Israel ===
{{See also|Nuclear weapons and Israel}}
Well before the Vela Incident, American intelligence agencies had made the assessment that Israel probably possessed its own [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|nuclear weapons]].{{sfn|CIA|1974}}  According to journalist [[Seymour Hersh]], the detection was the third joint [[Israel–South Africa relations|Israeli-South African]] nuclear test in the Indian Ocean, and the Israelis had sent two [[tsahal|IDF]] ships and "a contingent of Israeli military men and nuclear experts" for the test.{{sfn|Hersh|1991|p=271}} Author [[Richard Rhodes]] also concludes the incident was an Israeli nuclear test, conducted in cooperation with South Africa, and that the United States administration deliberately obscured this fact in order to avoid complicating relations with South Africa.{{sfn|Rhodes|2011|pp=164–69}} Likewise, Leonard Weiss offers a number of arguments to support the test being Israeli, and claims that successive U.S. administrations continue to cover up the test to divert unwanted attention that may portray its foreign policy in a bad light.{{sfn|Weiss|2011}} In the 2008 book ''The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and its Proliferation'' [[Thomas C. Reed]] and Danny B. Stillman stated their opinion that the "double flash" was the result of a joint South African-Israeli nuclear bomb test.{{sfn|Broad|2008|p=2}} [[David Albright]] stated in his article about the "double flash" event in the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' that "If the 1979 flash was caused by a test, most experts agree it was probably an Israeli test".{{sfn|Albright|1994|p=42}}

In 2010, it was reported that, on 27 February 1980, President [[Jimmy Carter]] wrote in his diary, "We have a growing belief among our scientists that the Israelis did indeed conduct a nuclear test explosion in the ocean near the southern end of Africa."&lt;ref name="Jimmy Carter 2010 page 405"&gt;Jimmy Carter, ''White House Diary'' (Norton and Co., 2010), p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard Weiss, of the [[Center for International Security and Cooperation]] at [[Stanford University]] writes: "The weight of the evidence that the Vela event was an Israeli nuclear test assisted by South Africa appears overwhelming."&lt;ref&gt;''Israel’s 1979 Nuclear Test and the U.S. Cover-Up'', Leonard Weiss, Middle East Policy Journal, Vol. 18 no. 4, pp. 83–95, Winter 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed has written that he believes the Vela incident was an Israeli [[neutron bomb]] test.{{sfn|Reed|Stillman|2010|p=177}} The test would have gone undetected as the Israelis specifically chose a window of opportunity when, according to the published data, no active Vela satellites were observing the area. Although the decade-old Vela satellite that detected the blast was officially listed as "retired" by the U.S. government, it was still able to receive data. Additionally, the Israelis chose to set off the test during a typhoon.{{sfn|Reed|Stillman|2010|p=178}}  By 1984, according to [[Mordechai Vanunu]], Israel was mass-producing neutron bombs.{{sfn|Reed|Stillman|2010|p=181}}

=== South Africa ===
{{See also|Israel–South Africa relations}}
The Republic of South Africa did have a [[South Africa and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons program]] at the time,&lt;ref name="The Bomb" /&gt; and it falls within that geographic location. Nevertheless, it had acceded to the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/t/isn/4797.htm|title=Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water|publisher=United States Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since the end of [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]], South Africa has disclosed most of the information on its nuclear weapons programme. According to international inspections and the ensuing [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] report, South Africa could not have constructed such a nuclear bomb until November 1979, two months after the "double flash" incident. Furthermore, the IAEA reported that all possible South African nuclear bombs had been accounted for. A [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) report dated 21 January 1980, that was produced for the United States [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]], concluded that:{{sfn|Clarke|1979|p=11}}{{quote|In sum, State/INR finds the arguments that South Africa conducted a nuclear test on 22 September ''inconclusive'', even though, if a nuclear explosion occurred on that date, South Africa is the most likely candidate for responsibility.}}

The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 418]] of 4 November 1977 introduced a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa, which also required all states to refrain from "any co-operation with South Africa in the manufacture and development of nuclear weapons".{{sfn|United Nations|1977}}

Sasha Polakow-Suransky writes that, in 1979, South Africa was not yet advanced enough to test a nuclear device: "By the first week of October, the State Department had realized that South Africa was probably not the guilty party; Israel was a more likely candidate."&lt;ref&gt;''The Unspoken Alliance: Israel's Secret Relationship with Apartheid South Africa'', by Sasha Polakow-Suransky, (Vintage 2011), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soviet Union ===
In 1979, the DIA reported that the test might have been a Soviet test done in violation of the 1963 [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].{{sfn|Richelson|2007|p=419}} Twenty years earlier in 1959, the USSR had conducted secret underwater tests in the Pacific in violation of the 1958 bilateral moratorium between the Soviet Union and the U.S. (cf. [[List of nuclear weapons tests of the Soviet Union]])&lt;ref&gt;"One hell of a gamble by Aleksandr Fursenko and Timothy Naftali" p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Jan 1985 p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Essays of a Soviet Scientists By Vitaliĭ Iosifovich Golʹdanskiĭ p195&lt;/ref&gt; before the 1958 moratorium was unilaterally and officially abrogated by the Soviet Union in 1961.

=== India ===
India had carried out a [[nuclear testing|nuclear test]] in 1974 (codenamed ''[[Smiling Buddha]]''). The possibility that India would test a weapon was considered, since it would be possible for the [[Indian Navy]] to operate in those waters so far south; however, this was dismissed as impractical and unnecessary (given the fact that India had signed and ratified the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]] or LTBT in 1963, and had complied with it even in its first test, and that India was not hiding its nuclear weapons capability).{{sfn|Richelson|2007|loc=§&amp;nbsp;7: The Double Flash}}

=== Pakistan ===
An interagency intelligence memorandum requested by the [[United States National Security Council]] and entitled "The 22 September 1979 Event" analyzed the possibility of Pakistan wanting to prove its nuclear explosive technology in secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/119217|title=Interagency Intelligence Memorandum, US Director of Central Intelligence, NI IIM 79-10028, 'The 22 September 1979 Event' &amp;#91;2013 Release&amp;#93;|author=Wilson Center Digital Archive|publisher=|access-date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
Since the "double flash", if one existed, could have occurred not very far to the west of the French-owned [[Kerguelen Islands]], it is possible that the French were testing a small [[neutron bomb]]{{sfn|Richelson|2007|p=296}} or other small tactical nuclear bomb.

== Subsequent developments ==
[[File:Vela Los Alamos report.pdf|thumbnail|right|1981 Los Alamos report as cited.]]
Since 1980, some small amounts of new information have emerged. However, most questions remain unanswered.
A Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory report from 1981 notes:{{sfn|Hones|Baker|Feldman|1981}} {{quote|TIROS-N plasma data and related geophysical data measured on 22 September 1979 were analyzed to determine whether the electron precipitation event detected by TIROS-N at 00:54:49 universal time could have been related to a surface nuclear burst (SNB). The occurrence of such a burst was inferred from light signals detected by two Vela bhangmeters −2 min before the TIROS-N event. We found the precipitation to be unusually large but not unique. It probably resulted from passage of TIROS-N through the precipitating electrons above a pre-existing [[aurora]]l arc that may have brightened to an unusually high intensity from natural causes −3 min before the Vela signals....We conclude that such an event, although rare, is not unique and, furthermore, that this particular event was associated with an auroral arc that probably existed before the Vela event. Although it may be argued that the segment of the arc sampled by the TIROS-N was intensified by a SNB, we find no evidence to support this thesis or to suggest that the observation was anything but the result of natural [[magnetosphere|magnetospheric]] processes.}}
In October 1984, a [[National Intelligence Estimate]] on the South African nuclear program noted: {{quote|There is still considerable disagreement within the Intelligence Community as to whether the flash in the South Atlantic detected by a US [...] satellite in September 1979 was a nuclear test, and if so, by South Africa. If the latter, the need for South Africa to test a device during the time frame of this Estimate is significantly diminished.{{sfn|CIA|1984|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} A shorter form of this wording was used in a subsequent [[National Intelligence Council]] memorandum of September 1985.{{sfn|National Intelligence Council|1985}}
In February 1994, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Dieter Gerhardt]], a convicted [[History of Soviet espionage|Soviet spy]] and the commander of South Africa's [[Simon's Town]] naval base at the time, talked about the incident upon his release from prison. He said: {{quote|Although I was not directly involved in planning or carrying out the operation, I learned unofficially that the flash was produced by an Israeli-South African test, code-named ''Operation Phoenix''. The explosion was clean and was not supposed to be detected. But they were not as smart as they thought, and the weather changed—so the Americans were able to pick it up.{{sfn|Albright|1994|p=42}}}} Gerhardt further stated that no South African naval vessels had been involved, and that he had no first-hand knowledge of a nuclear test. In 1993, then President F.W. de Klerk admitted that South Africa had indeed possessed six assembled nuclear weapons, with a seventh in production, but that they had been dismantled (before the first all-race elections of April 1994). There was no mention specifically of the Vela incident or of Israeli cooperation in South Africa's nuclear program.
On 20 April 1997, the Israeli daily newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' quoted the South African deputy foreign minister, [[Aziz Pahad]], as supposedly confirming that the "double flash" from over the Indian Ocean was indeed from a South African nuclear test. Haaretz also cited past reports that Israel had purchased 550 tons of uranium from South Africa for its own nuclear plant in [[Dimona]]. In exchange, Israel allegedly supplied South Africa with nuclear weapons design information and nuclear materials to increase the power of nuclear warheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/07/southafrica.israel |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Chris |last=McGreal |title=Brothers in arms – Israel's secret pact with Pretoria |date=10 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pahad's statement was confirmed by the United States embassy in [[Pretoria]], South Africa,{{sfn|Los Alamos National Laboratory – 1997}}{{sfn|Pike}} but Pahad's press secretary stated that Pahad had said only that "there was a strong rumor that a test had taken place, and that it should be investigated". In other words, he was merely repeating rumors that had been circulating for years.{{sfn|Albright|1997}}&lt;!-- Unreliable {{sfn|Sublette|2001}}--&gt; [[David Albright]], commenting on the stir created by this press report, stated:{{sfn|Albright|1997}}{{quote|The U.S. government should declassify additional information about the event. A thorough public airing of the existing information could resolve the controversy.}}
In October 1999, a white paper that was published by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] Republican Policy Committee in opposition to the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] stated: {{quote|There remains uncertainty about whether the South Atlantic flash in September 1979 recorded by optical sensors on the U.S. Vela satellite was a nuclear detonation and, if so, to whom it belonged.{{sfn|Bartoli|1999|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}
In 2003, [[Stansfield Turner]], the Director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] during the Carter administration, stated that the Vela detection was of a "man-made phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;''Spying on the Bomb: American Nuclear Intelligence from Nazi Germany to Iran and North Korea'' Jeffrey T. Richelson, (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2007), p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;
In his 2006 book ''On the Brink'', the retired [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] clandestine service officer [[Tyler Drumheller]] wrote of his 1983–88 tour-of-duty in South Africa: {{quote|We had operational successes, most importantly regarding Pretoria's nuclear capability. My sources collectively provided incontrovertible evidence that the apartheid government had in fact tested a nuclear bomb in the South Atlantic in 1979, and that they had developed a delivery system with assistance from the Israelis.}}

In 2010, [[Jimmy Carter]] published his ''White House Diaries''. In the entry for 22 September 1979, he wrote "There was indication of a nuclear explosion in the region of South Africa—either South Africa, Israel using a ship at sea, or nothing."&lt;ref name="politico20161208"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/1979-vela-incident-nuclear-test-israel-south-africa-214507 |title=What the U.S. Government Really Thought of Israel’s Apparent 1979 Nuclear Test |last=Cohen |first=Abner |date=2016-12-08 |work=Politico |last2=Burr |first2=William}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 27 February 1980, he wrote "We have a growing belief among our scientists that the Israelis did indeed conduct a nuclear test explosion in the ocean near the southern end of Africa."&lt;ref name="Jimmy Carter 2010 page 405" /&gt;

Several diplomatic cables released as part of the [[United States diplomatic cables leak|2010 WikiLeaks cable leaks]] revealed some of the US state department's initial assessment of the data obtained from the Vela satellite; a cable dated 26 October 1979 states: {{quote|We have subjected this data to an intensive technical review and this review supports the conclusion that a nuclear explosion probably did occur.|&lt;ref&gt;1979STATE279478_e&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Some American information related to this incident has been declassified in the form of heavily redacted reports and memoranda following requests for records made under the US [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]; on 5 May 2006, many of these declassified documents were made available through the [[National Security Archive]].{{sfn|Richelson|2006}}
A December 2016 report by William Burr and Avner Cohen of [[George Washington University]]'s National Security Archive and [[Nuclear Proliferation International History Project]] noted that the debate over the South Atlantic flash has shifted over the last few years, on the side of a man-made weapon test.&lt;ref name=NSArchive /&gt; The National Security Archive briefing concluded: {{quote|A [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-sponsored panel of well-respected scientists concluded that a mysterious flash detected by a U.S. Vela satellite over the South Atlantic on the night of 22 September 1979 was likely a nuclear test.}}
The newly released research and subsequent report was largely based upon recently declassified documents in files at the National Archives of [[Gerard C. Smith]], a former Ambassador and special envoy on nuclear nonproliferation during Jimmy Carter's presidency.&lt;ref name=NSArchive&gt;{{cite report|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb570-The-22-September-1979-Vela-Satellite-Incident/ |title=Vela Incident: South Atlantic Mystery Flash in September 1979 Raised Questions about Nuclear Test|journal= National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 570 |date=8 December 2016|editor1-first=William |editor1-last=Burr|editor2-first=Avner |editor2-last=Cohen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="presstv.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishbusinessnews.com" /&gt; Smith had once said: "I was never able to break free from the thought that the event was a joint operation between Israel and South Africa." The documents cited a June 1980 [[U.S. State Department]] report where [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] Vice Director [[Jack Varona]] had said the ensuing U.S. investigation was a "white wash, due to political considerations" based on "flimsy evidence." He added that the "weight of the evidence pointed towards a nuclear event" and cited [[hydroacoustics|hydroacoustic]] data analyzed by the [[Naval Research Laboratory]]. The data, he suggested, involved "signals... unique to nuclear shots in a maritime environment" and emanating from the area of "shallow waters between Prince Edward and Marion Islands, south-east of South Africa."&lt;ref name=NSArchive /&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishbusinessnews.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="presstv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/12/09/497178/Israel-South-Africa-nuclear-test-Jimmy-Carter-Gerard-Smith|title='Israel, S Africa conducted nuclear test in 1979'|publisher=Press TV|date=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In ''[[The West Wing]]'' fifth season episode "The Warfare of Genghis Khan", the main story revolves around a present day Vela incident, here confirmed to be a nuclear test performed by Israel.

Flight Lieutenant '''Clarke Wallace Chant Floody''' {{post-nominals|size=100%|MBE}} (April 28, 1918 – September 25, 1989) was an imprisoned Canadian [[World War II]] pilot who was instrumental in organizing and implementing the "[[Stalag Luft III escape|Great Escape]]" from the German [[prisoner of war]] camp [[Stalag Luft III]].

== Biography ==

Floody was born in [[Chatham-Kent, Ontario|Chatham]], Ontario, and attended [[Northern Secondary School (Toronto)|Northern Vocational School]]. In 1936 he headed north to work at the Preston East Dome Mines in [[Timmins]], Ontario, as a mucker—shovelling the rock and mud into carts to be hauled up to the surface.

At the onset of the war, Floody was working on a ranch in [[Alberta]] when he decided to return home to enlist in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF). He financed his trip back east by shovelling coal into the boiler of the locomotive for the entire trip back to Toronto. After learning that the RCAF was not quite ready for the huge influx of personnel, Wally and Betty married on May 24, 1940, and moved to [[Kirkland Lake]], where Wally could go back to work in the mines.

In 1940, Floody and his wife were back in Toronto visiting family. Anxious to find out what was happening to his enlistment application, Floody checked with the recruiting office only to find his application was at the bottom of the pile. The reason: he was now married. After convincing the recruiting officer that "My wife backs me in this 100%", he was advised that the train was leaving for the [[BCATP]] [[Brandon Municipal Airport|air station]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]], [[Manitoba]] that evening. After a quick goodbye to his family Floody was on his way to becoming an operational pilot and flying with [[No. 401 Squadron RCAF|No. 401 Squadron]].&lt;ref name="Barbara Hehner"&gt;{{cite book |first=Barbara |last=Hehner |title=The Tunnel King: The True Story of Wally Floody &amp; the Great Escape |year=2004 |publisher=Harper Trophy Canada |isbn=0-00-639477-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating from [[RAF Biggin Hill]] in England, his [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] was shot down on 27 October 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aircrewremembered.com/thompson-stanley.html |title=27.10.1941 No. 401 Squadron Spitfire Vb W3601 Fl/Sgt. Thompson |work=Aircrew Remembered |date=2014 |accessdate=November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; over [[Saint-Omer]], [[France]], where he was met by two German soldiers. He was imprisoned at the POW camp [[Stalag Luft III]] at Sagan (now [[Żagań]], [[Poland]]). There he joined the "X-Organization", headed by [[Roger Bushell]] (codenamed "Big-X"), who put Wally in charge of digging tunnels and their [[camouflage]], for the upcoming escape attempts by [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and European prisoners.

However, in March 1944, the German guards, always suspicious of escapes, caught the telltale sign of sand being dropped by one of the 'penguins' out the bottom of his pant legs and immediately rounded up Wally and 19 others and transferred them to another camp in Belaria.

The escape of 76 men went ahead on the moonless night of March 24, 1944. Eventually the Germans caught all but three prisoners, and to make an example of them to all the other prisoners, Hitler ordered the execution of 50 of the recaptured Allied officers under the pretext that they were shot while attempting escape. At the end of the war Floody gave evidence about conditions in POW camps at the [[Nuremberg trials]].

On September 22, 1946, two days after Betty's and Wally's first son Brian was born, they received news that Wally had been made a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] by King George VI; the citation reading, in part:

{{quote|Flight Lieutenant (F/L) Floody made a thorough study of tunnelling work and devised many different methods &amp; techniques. He became one of the leading organizers and indefatigable workers in the tunnels themselves. Besides being arduous, his work was frequently dangerous....F/L Floody was buried under heavy falls of sand.....but, despite all dangers and difficulties, F/L Floody persisted, showing a marked degree of courage and devotion to duty.''&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37744 |date=27 September 1946 |page=4901 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Returning to civilian life he became a businessman and co-founder of the Royal Canadian Air Force Prisoners of War Association. He died on September 25, 1989.

== Feature film involvement ==
[[File:Steve McQueen and Wally Floody 001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Steve McQueen]] with Wally Floody, while Floody was a technical advisor in production of the film ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]''.]]
In early 1962, Floody received a phone call from director [[John Sturges]].&lt;ref name="Barbara Hehner" /&gt; He told Floody he was planning to make a film based on the book by [[Paul Brickhill]], an Australian flyer and writer who, like Floody, had spent time at Stalag Luft III. After Sturges's assurance that the film was to be as accurate as theatrically possible but true to the efforts of those prisoners and the atmosphere of the camps, Floody agreed to be technical adviser on the 1963 feature film ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' which was filmed on locations in Germany during the summer of 1962. He is popularly considered the real-life counterpart to that film's fictional "Tunnel King", Danny Velinski, played by [[Charles Bronson]].&lt;ref name="TGE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyinfilm.com/escape/real10.htm |title=History in film – The Great Escape |publisher=Historyinfilm.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tunnel king"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A978104 |title=BBC – The Great Escape |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''War Memorials Trust''' works for the protection and conservation of [[war memorial]]s in the [[UK]]. The charity provides free information and advice as well as administering grant schemes for the repair and conservation of war memorials.

War Memorials Trust works with other organisations such as [[Historic England]] and [[Historic Environment Scotland]] to better safeguard the future of war memorials in both their social and historical context.

== Objectives ==
The charity’s four objectives are:

# To monitor the condition of war memorials and to encourage protection and conservation.
# To provide expert advice to those involved in war memorial projects, to act as the specialist organisation for war memorial conservation issues and to facilitate repair and conservation through grants schemes.
# To work with relevant organisations to encourage them to accept responsibility for war memorials and recognise the need to undertake repair and conservation work.
# To build a greater understanding of war memorial heritage and raise awareness of the issues surrounding war memorial conservation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://volunteerteam.london.gov.uk/organizations/index.php?org_id=71 War Memorials Trust.] Team London. Retrieved 2017-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
War Memorials Trust was registered as a charity on 7 May 1997.&lt;ref name="charitycommission"&gt;[http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1062255&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 War Memorials Trust, Charity framework.] Charity Commission. Retrieved 2012-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally known as Friends of War Memorials. [[Donald Thompson|Sir Donald Thompson]], then MP for Calderdale, [[Winston Churchill (1940–2010)|Winston S Churchill]], grandson of the wartime Prime Minister, and Ian Davidson, a former Royal Marine, were amongst those involved in founding the charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warmemorials.org/history/ History.] War Memorials. Retrieved 2012-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Donald Thompson became the Director-General of the charity and Winston S Churchill the President.

The Trust’s charity deed outlines the aim "… to educate the public and to foster patriotism and good citizenship by remembering those who have fallen in war by preserving and maintaining war memorials."&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1062255&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 War Memorials Trust, Charity Framework] Charity Commission. Retrieved 2017-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2004 the Trustees of the charity decided upon a new name, War Memorials Trust, to replace Friends of War Memorials.  The change came into effect in January 2005, along with a change of logo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warmemorials.org/logo/ Logo.] War Memorials. Retrieved 2012-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation advice ==

The learning programme provides National Curriculum linked lesson materials for primary and secondary school teachers, and offers talks or assemblies for schools and youth groups such as Scouts, Cadets and Duke of Edinburgh Award participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnaboutwarmemorials.org/about/what-do/ ''What War Memorials Trust's Learning Programme does''.] Retrieved 2012-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
