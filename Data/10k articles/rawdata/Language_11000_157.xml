'''Anfinsen's dogma''' (also known as the '''thermodynamic hypothesis''') is a postulate in [[molecular biology]] that states that, at least for a small globular protein in its standard physiological environment, the [[protein structure|native structure]] is determined only by the protein's [[amino acid]] [[primary structure|sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Anfinsen CB | title=Principles that govern the folding of protein chains | journal=Science | volume=181 |issue=4096 |year=1973 | pages=223–230 | pmid=4124164 | doi=10.1126/science.181.4096.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dogma was championed by the [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize Laureate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1972/press.html|title=Press Release: The 1972 Nobel Prize in Chemistry|website=Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian B. Anfinsen]] from his research on the folding of ribonuclease A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=White FH | title=Regeneration of native secondary and tertiary structures by air oxidation of reduced ribonuclease | journal=J. Biol. Chem. | volume=236 |year=1961 | pages=1353–1360 | pmid=13784818}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Anfinsen CB, Haber E, Sela M, ((White FH Jr)) | title=The kinetics of formation of native ribonuclease during oxidation of the reduced polypeptide chain | journal=PNAS | volume=47 | issue=9 |year=1961 | pages=1309–1314 | pmid=13683522 | doi=10.1073/pnas.47.9.1309 | pmc=223141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The postulate amounts to saying that, at the environmental conditions (temperature, solvent concentration and composition, etc.) at which folding occurs, the native structure is a unique, stable and kinetically accessible minimum of the free energy.
The three conditions:

:'''Uniqueness''': requires that the sequence does not have any other configuration with a comparable free energy. Hence the free energy minimum must be ''unchallenged''.

:'''Stability''': small changes in the surrounding environment cannot give rise to changes in the minimum configuration. This can be pictured as a free energy surface that looks more like a funnel (with the native state in the bottom of it) rather than like a soup plate (with several closely related low-energy states); the free energy surface around the native state must be rather steep and high, in order to provide stability.

:'''Kinetical accessibility''': means that the path in the free energy surface from the unfolded to the folded state must be reasonably smooth or, in other words, that the folding of the chain must not involve highly complex changes in the shape (like knots or other high order conformations).

How the protein reaches this structure is the subject of the field of [[protein folding]], which has a related concept called [[Levinthal's paradox]]. The Levinthal paradox states that the number of possible conformations available to a given protein is astronomically large, such that even a small protein of 100 residues would require more time than the universe has existed (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) to explore all possible conformations and choose the appropriate one, it would also arguably make computational prediction of protein structures under the same basis unfeasible if not impossible.

Also, some proteins need the assistance of another protein called a [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperone protein]] to fold properly. It has been suggested that this disproves Anfinsen's dogma. However, the chaperones do not appear to affect the final state of the protein; they seem to work primarily by preventing [[Protein aggregation|aggregation]] of several protein molecules prior to the final folded state of the protein.

[[Prion]]s are an exception to Anfinsen's dogma. Prions are stable conformations of proteins which differ from the native folding state. In [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (Mad Cow Disease), native proteins re-fold into a different stable conformation, which causes fatal [[amyloid]] buildup. Other amyloid diseases, including [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], are also exceptions to Anfinsen's dogma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/rhoadeslab/research.html |title=Protein Folding and Misfolding |publisher=Yale University Rhoades Lab |accessdate=2012-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719110222/http://www.yale.edu/rhoadeslab/research.html |archivedate=2012-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''aura''' is a perceptual disturbance experienced by some with [[migraine]]s or [[seizure]]s. The aura stage precedes a seizure in epilepsy but can happen at any stage of a migraine.  It often manifests as the perception of a strange light, an unpleasant smell, or confusing thoughts or experiences. Some people experience aura without a subsequent migraine or seizure (see [[Acephalgic migraine|silent migraine]]). Auras vary by individual experience; some people experience smells, lights, or hallucinations. Less known symptoms of the eye include disturbances, where the eyes roll in the back of the head caused by photosensitivity. A sufferer of this type of aura may experience tearfulness of the eyes and uncontrollable sensations of light followed by reduced symptoms after approximately 20 minutes; it is the rarest type of aura.

When occurring, auras allow people who have epilepsy time to prevent injury to themselves and/or others. The time between the appearance of the aura and the migraine lasts from a few seconds up to an hour. The aura can stay with a migraine sufferer for the duration of the migraine; depending on the type of aura, it can leave the person disoriented and confused. It is common for migraine sufferers to experience more than one type of aura during the migraine. Most people who have auras have the same type of aura every time.

Auras can also be confused with sudden onset of panic, [[panic attack]]s or [[anxiety]] attacks creating difficulties in diagnosis. The [[differential diagnosis]] of patients who experience symptoms of [[paresthesia]]s, [[derealization]], dizziness, chest pain, tremors, and palpitations can be quite challenging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/jnp.2006.18.4.436 Sudden Onset Panic: Epileptic Aura or Panic Disorder?] Robin A. Hurley, M.D., Ronald Fisher, M.D., Ph.D. and Katherine H. Taber, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seizures==

An epileptic aura is the consequence of the activation of functional cortex by abnormal, unilateral, and brief neuronal discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fernandez-Torre JL | year = 2002 | title = Epileptic auras: classification, pathophysiology, practical usefulness, differential diagnosis and controversials | url = | journal = Revista de Neurologia | volume = 34 | issue = 10| pages = 977–983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being a warning sign to an upcoming seizure, the nature of an aura can give insight into the localization and lateralization of the [[seizure]] or [[migraine]].

Not everyone experiences an aura with a seizure, but the most common auras include motor, somatosensory, visual, and auditory symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sharma S., Dixit V. | year = 2013 | title = Epilepsy – A Comprehensive Review | url = | journal = International Journal of Pharmacological Research &amp; Review | volume = 2 | issue = 12| pages = 61–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The activation in the brain during an aura can spread through multiple regions continuously or discontinuously, on the same side or to both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tuxhorn I. E. B. | year = 2005 | title = Somatosensory auras in focal epilepsy: A clinical, video EEG and MRI study | url = | journal = Seizure: European Journal of Epilepsy | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 262–268 | doi=10.1016/j.seizure.2005.02.005| pmid = 15911361 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auras are particularly common in [[focal seizures]]. If the [[motor cortex]] is involved in the overstimulation of neurons, motor auras can result. Likewise, somatosensory auras (such as tingling, numbness, and pain) can result if in the somatosensory cortex. When the [[primary somatosensory cortex]] is activated, more discrete parts on the opposite side of the body and the secondary somatosensory areas result in symptoms ipsilateral to the seizure focus.

Visual auras can be simple or complex. Simple visual symptoms can include static, flashing, or moving lights/shapes/colors caused mostly by abnormal activity in the [[primary visual cortex]]. Complex visual auras can include people, scenes, and objects which results from stimulation of the temporo-occipital junction and is lateralized to one hemifield. Auditory auras can also be simple (ringing, buzzing) or complex (voices, music). Simple symptoms can occur from activation in the [[primary auditory cortex]] and complex symptoms from the temporo-occipital cortex at the location of the auditory association areas.&lt;ref name=foldvary&gt;Foldvary-Schaefer, N. &amp; Unnwonqse, K. (2011). Localizing and Lateralizing features of auras and seizures. Epilepsy behavior 20: 160-166&lt;/ref&gt;

'''B. D. Ganapathy''' ('''Bācamāḍa Ḍevaiah Gaṇapati''') was a noted writer, scholar and journalist writing in English, [[Kannada]] and [[Kodava Takk]], covering religion, anthropology and philosophy. He is particularly noted for his coverage of the [[Kodagu]] (Coorg) region and the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] ethno-linguistic group, his own birthplace and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A study of the origins of Coorgs |first=K. C. |last=Ponnappa |year=1999 |publisher=K. C. Ponappa |location=[[Chettalli]], [[Kodagu]], [[Karnataka]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ganapathy was born in Besagoor village in Coorg in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81114543.html |title=Ganapathy, B. D. |website=Library of Congress |accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a journalist for a newspaper in [[Karnataka]] state, and author of several books on Kodavas and other subjects in Kodava Takk, Kannada and English languages.

==Indian Independence Movement==
During the Indian Independence Movement, he was the sub-editor of the ''Kodagu'', a pro-Independence weekly Kannada newspaper founded by his father-in-law, editor and freedom fighter Pandyanda I. Belliappa, who was known as Kodagu's Gandhi. In 1942 the  British India authorities restricted the publication of the ''Kodagu'' weekly and had B. D. Ganapathy imprisoned along with his father-in-law.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Books==
Among Ganapathy's most noted works is his 1967 ''Kodavas (Coorgs), their customs and culture'' published by the Kodagu Ltd., also called the Coorg company, which owned the ''Kodagu'' weekly. Other works include: ''The Eternal Quest'' (1970), ''Naṅga Koḍava'' (1973 in Kodava takk), ''Kodavas'' (1980) and ''Kanni Kāvēri'' (1990 in Kodava Takk). Among his works two books are in the Kodava Language: ''Nanga Kodava'' and ''Kuttambolicha''. His Kannada book on Kodava culture ''Kodagu mattu Kodavaru'' has won him the State Academy Award. He wrote 11 works in 16 publications and in three languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n81-114543 |title=Ganapathy, B. D. |work=Worldcat |accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recently, efforts are being made to foster Kodava literature and for the same purpose the Kodava Thak Parishat was established in 1978. The first conference was presided over by B. D. Ganapathi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onsouthindia.com/on/kodava-language-literature.html |title=Kodava Language and Literature |website=onsouthindia.com |accessdate=13 June 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324014404/http://www.onsouthindia.com/on/kodava-language-literature.html |archivedate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book has been written about him in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Dhanu, Iynaṇḍa.

'''Back-bond''', or '''back-letter''', in [[Scots law]], is a [[deed]] qualifying the terms of another deed, or declaratory of the purposes for which another deed has been granted. Thus an [[ex facie]] absolute disposition, qualified by a back-bond expressing the limited nature of the right actually held by the person to whom the disposition is made, would constitute what in England is termed a [[Trust instrument|deed of trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Back-Bond|volume=3|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bento Teixeira''' (1561? – 1618?) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] poet. He is considered to be the introducer of [[Baroque]] in the Portuguese [[colony of Brazil]] and the first Brazilian poet — however, this last affirmation is contested by many historians.

==Life==
Details about Teixeira's life are very sparse. His birthplace is most commonly accepted to be [[Porto]], [[Portugal]], to Manuel Álvares de Barros and Lianor Rodrigues. Teixeira moved to the colony of Brazil in 1567(?), first living in [[Bahia]], but he had to flee to [[Pernambuco]] when he was accused of being a [[Jew]].

In Pernambuco, Bento Teixeira became a teacher of [[Arithmetics]], [[Grammar]] and [[Latin]]. Returning to Bahia, he married Filipa Raposa in the city of [[Ilhéus]], in 1584(?).

Allegedly, Teixeira [[murder]]ed his wife under suspects of [[adultery]], what made him flee to Pernambuco once more. Refugiated at the Monastery of São Bento, he wrote his masterpiece ''Prosopopeia''.

Another version tells that Teixeira's wife accused him of being Jewish. After being interrogated and absolved in 1589, he was intimated by the caller of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], and Teixeira then confessed that he was a follower of the [[Judaism]]. Enraged by his wife's delation, he murdered her and fled to the aforementioned monastery. However, he was found, arrested and sent to [[Lisbon]] in 1595(?), staying there until his death.

==Works==
Many works were attributed to Teixeira, such as:

* ''Relações do Naufrágio'': According to studies made by [[Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, Viscount of Porto Seguro|Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen]], it was written by Afonso Luís, pilot of a [[carrack]] named ''Santo António'', mentioned in the poem ''Prosopopeia''.
* ''Diálogos das Grandezas do Brasil'': According to [[Capistrano de Abreu]], it was written by Ambrósio Fernandes Brandão.

The only one whose authorship is confirmed was the epic poem ''[[Prosopopeia]]'', written in [[1601 in literature|1601]]. The poem, inspired by [[Luís de Camões]]' ''[[Os Lusíadas]]'', tells about the life and works of the then-governor of [[Pernambuco]] Jorge de Albuquerque Coelho and his brother Duarte.

There are many translations of the [[Bible]] into [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]] language.

==History==
The first translation in Serbian is the famous [[Miroslav Gospel]] from 1186. It is currently in the [[National Museum of Serbia]] in Belgrade and is valued as the national treasure.

The first printed Bible was of [[Atanasije Stojković]] (published by the [[Russian Bible Society]] at [[Saint Petersburg]], 1824) but was not written in the [[vernacular]] Serbian, but was a mixture of [[Church Slavonic]] and Serbian. Stojković later translated the [[New Testament]] to Serbian in 1830. A more popular translation of the New Testament by [[Vuk Karadžić]] was published in [[Vienna]] in 1847, and was combined with the translation of the [[Old Testament]] of 1867 by [[Đuro Daničić]] in [[Belgrade]], printed together in 1868.

Other subsequent translations are the following:
* Lujo Bakotić, 1933, complete Bible
* Dimitrije Stefanović, 1934, New Testament
* Emilijan Čarnić, 1973, New Testament; Psalms, 1985.
* Serbian Orthodox Synod, 1984, New Testament
* Aleksandar Birviš, Matthew through John, 1987; Psalms, 1990; Genesis, 2003; Hebrews, 2003; Lamentations, 2005; Isaiah, 2006

The '''Birhor language''' is a highly endangered [[Munda language]] spoken by the [[Birhor people|Birhor]] people in [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Odisha]], [[West Bengal]], and [[Maharashtra]] states in [[India]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

According to Vidyarthi (1960:519), the Birhor are found mostly in [[Chota Nagpur plateau|Chota Nagpur]] and Santhal Paragana, with the Uthlu Birhors living near Bishunpur, [[Gumla district]], [[Jharkhand]] (along the western border with [[Chhattisgarh]]).

== Status ==
Most Birhor know Santali and Hindi, and a small minority know Ho. However, children still learn the language, and Birhor families use the language all the time at home. In addition, most Birhor want to be educated in their own language, and the language is used in most community affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.academia.edu/download/36763764/Birhor-_A_SOCIOLINGUISTIC_STUDY_OF_LANGUAGE_ENDANGEREDMENT_PAPER.pdf|title=Birhor: A Sociolinguistic Study of Language Endangerment|last=Sarkar|first=Sangita|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Biological classification}}

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]], '''class''' ({{lang-la|classis}}) is  a [[taxonomic rank]], as well as a taxonomic unit, a [[taxon]], in that rank.{{efn|When the term denotes taxonomic units, the plural is classes (Latin ''classes'').}} Other well-known ranks in descending order of size are [[life]], [[domain (biology)|domain]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[genus]], and [[species]], with class fitting between phylum and order. As for the other well-known ranks, there is the option of an immediately lower rank, indicated by the prefix ''sub-'': subclass (Latin: ''subclassis''). For example, [[dog]]s are in the class [[Mammalia]].

The composition of each class is determined by a [[taxonomist]]. Often there is no exact agreement, with different taxonomists taking different positions. There are no hard rules that a taxonomist needs to follow in describing a class, but for well-known animals there is likely to be consensus. 

In botany, classes are now rarely discussed. Since the first publication of the [[APG system]] in 1998, which proposed a taxonomy of the [[flowering plant]]s up to the level of orders, many sources have preferred to treat ranks higher than orders as informal [[clade]]s. Where formal ranks have been assigned, the ranks have been reduced to a very much lower level, e.g. class Equisitopsida for the land plants, with the major divisions within the class assigned to subclasses and superorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Chase |first=Mark W. |last2=Reveal |first2=James L. |year=2009 |title=A phylogenetic classification of the land plants to accompany APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=122–127 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.01002.x |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hierarchy of ranks ==
For some clades, a number of alternative classifications are used.

===History of the concept===
The class as a distinct rank of biological classification having its own distinctive name (and not just called a ''top-level genus'' ''(genus summum)'') was first introduced by the [[France|French]] [[botanist]] [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] in his classification of plants that appeared in his ''Eléments de botanique'', 1694.

In the first edition of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr E.]] (1982). ''The Growth of Biological Thought''. Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-36446-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Linnaeus]] divided all three of his [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of Nature ([[mineral]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s) into classes. Only in the animal kingdom are Linnaeus's classes similar to the classes used today; his classes and orders of plants were never intended to represent natural groups, but rather to provide a convenient "artificial key" according to his ''[[Linnaean taxonomy#Classification for plants|Systema Sexuale]]'', largely based on the arrangement of flowers.

The class was considered the highest level of the taxonomic hierarchy until [[George Cuvier]]'s ''embranchements'', first called [[Phylum|Phyla]] by [[Ernst Haeckel]],&lt;ref&gt;Collins, A.G., Valentine, J.W. (2001). [http://si-pddr.si.edu/jspui/bitstream/10088/7403/1/Collins_Valentine_EvDev2001.pdf "Defining phyla: evolutionary pathways to metazoan body plans."] ''Evol. Dev''. '''3''': 432-442.&lt;/ref&gt; were introduced in the early nineteenth century.

Darbar is a Persian-derived term (from Persian: دربار - darbār) meaning the court or place of discussion of king, Prince, ruler or noble court. It was later used in [[Pakistan]], India and [[Nepal]] for a ruler's court or feudal levee as the latter came to be ruled and later administered by foreigners. A darbar may be either a [[feudal]] state council for administering the affairs of a princely state, or a [[Muslim]] [[shrine]] like [[Data Darbar|data darbar]] in [[Lahore]].

In mathematics, the '''determinantal conjecture''' of {{harvs|txt|last=Marcus|year=1972}} and {{harvs|txt|last=de Oliveira|year=1982}} asks whether the [[determinant]] of a sum ''A''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''B'' of two ''n'' by ''n'' [[Normal matrix|normal complex matrices]] ''A'' and ''B'' lies in the [[convex hull]] of the ''n''! points Π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (''λ(A)''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''λ(B)''&lt;sub&gt;σ(''i'')&lt;/sub&gt;), where the numbers ''λ(A)''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''λ(B)''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[eigenvalues]] of ''A'' and ''B'', and ''σ'' is an element of the symmetric group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Outside the [[Low Countries]], it is the native language of the majority of the population of [[Suriname]] where it also holds an official status, as it does in [[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]], which are constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands located in the [[Caribbean]].

French Flemish is spoken in the north-west of France by an estimated population of 20,000 daily speakers and 40,000 occasional speakers; see {{harvnb|European Commission|2010}}.&lt;br /&gt;A dialect continuum exists between Dutch and German through the [[South Guelderish]] and [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] dialects.&lt;br /&gt;In 1941, 400,000 Indonesians spoke Dutch, and Dutch exerted a major influence on Indonesian; see {{harvnb|Sneddon|2003|p=161}}. In 1941, about 0.5% of the inland population had a reasonable knowledge of Dutch; see {{harvnb|Maier|2005|p=12}}. At the beginning of World War II, about one million Asians had an active command of Dutch, while an additional half million had a passive knowledge; see {{harvnb|Jones|2008|p=xxxi}}. Many older Indonesians speak Dutch as a second language; see {{harvnb|Thomson|2003|p=80}}. Some of the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia speak Dutch amongst each other; see {{harvnb|Tan|2008|pp=62–64}}, {{harvnb|Erdentuğ|Colombijn|2002|p=104}}. Dutch is spoken by "smaller groups of speakers" in Indonesia; see {{harvnb|Bussmann|2002|p=83}}. Some younger Indonesians learn Dutch as a foreign language because their parents and grandparents may speak it and because in some circles, Dutch is regarded as the language of the elite; see {{harvnb|Vos|2001|p=91}}. At present, only educated people of the oldest generation, in addition to specialists who require knowledge of the language, can speak Dutch fluently; see {{harvnb|Ammon|2006|p=2017}}. Around 25% of present-day Indonesian vocabulary can be traced back to Dutch words, see {{harvnb|Maier|2005|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while up to half a million native speakers may reside in the United States, Canada and Australia combined.{{#tag:ref|410,000 in USA, 159,000 in Canada, 47,000 in Australia; see {{harvnb|Simpson|2009|p=307}}.

Typologically, Dutch takes a midway position between English and German, with a similar word order to that of German, grammatical gender, and a largely Germanic vocabulary. It is morphologically close to English, and the case system and subjunctive have largely fallen out of use; see {{harvnb|Swan|Smith|2001|p=6}}.|group="n"}} Dutch, like English, has not undergone the [[High German consonant shift]], does not use [[Germanic umlaut]] as a grammatical marker, has largely abandoned the use of the [[Subjunctive in Dutch|subjunctive]], and has [[Morphological leveling|levelled]] much of its morphology, including most of its case system.{{refn|Dutch shares with English its simplified morphology and the abandonment of the [[grammatical case|grammatical case system]]; see {{harvnb|Booij|1999|p=1}}, {{harvnb|Simpson|2009|p=309}}.

Owing to commercial and colonial rivalry in the 16th and 17th centuries between England and the [[Low Countries]], a cognate of ''theodisk'' (most likely Middle Dutch ''Duutsc'') was borrowed into English and developed into the [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] ''Dutch'', which came to refer exclusively to the people of the Netherlands. (A usage of the English term ''Dutch'' that includes German survives in the United States in the name [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] for a local German dialect and its speakers, commonly believed to be a corruption of their endonym ''Deitsch''.) In the Low Countries on the contrary, ''Dietsch'' or ''Duytsch'' as [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] for Dutch went out of common use and was gradually replaced by the Dutch endonym ''Nederlands''. This designation started at the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian court]] in the 15th century, although the use of ''neder'', ''laag'', ''bas'', and ''inferior'' ("nether" or "low") to refer to the area known as the Low Counties goes back further in time. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] referred to the region as ''[[Germania Inferior]]'' ("Lower" Germania).&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} See J. Verdam, ''Middelnederlandsch handwoordenboek'' (The Hague 1932 (reprinted 1994)): "Nederlant, znw. o.

Entry: Nether.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a reference to the Low Countries' downriver location at the [[Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta]] near the [[North Sea]].

From 1551 the designation ''Nederlands'' received strong competition from the name ''Nederduits'' ("Low Dutch;" ''Dutch'' is used here in its archaic sense that covers all continental West Germanic languages). It is a [[calque]] of the before mentioned Roman province ''Germania Inferior'' and an attempt by early Dutch grammarians to give their language more prestige by linking it to Roman times. Likewise, ''Hoogduits'' ("High Dutch") came into use as a Dutch exonym for the German language, spoken in neighboring German states.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, 19th century Germany saw the rise of the categorisation of dialects, and German [[dialectology|dialectologists]] termed the German dialects spoken in the mountainous south of Germany as ''Hochdeutsch'' ("High German"). Subsequently, German dialects spoken in the north were designated as ''Niederdeutsch'' ("Low German"). The names for these dialects were calqued in the Dutch language area as the exonyms ''Nederduits'' and ''Hoogduits''. As a result, ''Nederduits'' no longer served as a synonym for the Dutch language, and ''Nederlands'' prevailed as sole Dutch endonym. It also meant that ''Hoog'' ("High") had to be dropped in one of the two meanings of ''Hoogduits'', leading to the narrowing down of ''Duits'' as Dutch exonym for the German language, and ''Hoogduits'' as reference for southern German dialects.

==History==
[[File:GERMANICEXPANSION.GIF|thumb|Map of the [[pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe]] culture(s) associated with the [[Proto-Germanic language]], ca 500–50 BCE. The area south of Scandinavia is the [[Jastorf culture]].]]
[[Old Dutch]] branched off more or less around the same time as [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon), Old High German, [[Old Frisian]] and [[Old Saxon]] did. The early form of Dutch was a set of Franconian dialects spoken by the [[Salian Franks]] in the fifth century, and thus, it has developed through [[Middle Dutch]] to Modern Dutch over the course of 15 centuries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willemyns|first1=Roland|title=Dutch : biography of a language |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0199858713|pages=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, it forced Old Frisian back from the western coast to the north of the Low Countries, and influenced or even replaced Old Saxon spoken in the east (contiguous with the Low German area). On the other hand, Dutch has been replaced in adjacent lands in present-day France and Germany. The division into Old, Middle and Modern Dutch is mostly conventional, since the transition between them was very gradual. One of the few moments when [[Linguistics|linguists]] can detect something of a revolution is when the Dutch standard language emerged and quickly established itself. The development of the Dutch language is illustrated by the following sentence in Old, Middle and Modern Dutch:
* ''Irlôsin sol an frithe sêla mîna fan thên thia ginâcont mi, wanda under managon he was mit mi'' (Old Dutch)
* ''Erlossen sal [hi] in vrede siele mine van dien die genaken mi, want onder menegen hi was met mi'' (Middle Dutch)
* ''Verlossen zal hij in vrede ziel mijn van degenen die genaken mij, want onder menigen hij was met mij'' (Modern Dutch, same word order)
* ''Hij zal mijn ziel in vrede verlossen van degenen die mij genaken, want onder menigen was hij met mij'' (Modern Dutch, default word order)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statenvertaling.net/bijbel/psal/55.html Psalm 55:19&lt;/ref&gt;
* He will deliver my soul in peace from those who come on to me, because, amongst many, he was with me (English)&lt;ref&gt;http://bible.cc/psalms/55-18.htm Psalm 55:18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
{{Main article|History of the Dutch language}}
[[File:Germanic dialects ca. AD 1.png|thumb|The distribution of the primary [[Germanic languages]] in Europe in around AD 1:
{{legend|Blue|[[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]]}}

{{legend|Green|[[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]]}}]]
Among the [[Indo-European languages]], Dutch is grouped within the [[Germanic languages]], meaning it shares a [[common ancestor]] with languages such as English, German, and the [[Scandinavian languages]]. All Germanic languages are subject to the [[Grimm's law]] and [[Verner's law]] sound shifts, which originated in the [[Proto-Germanic language]] and define the basic features differentiating them from other Indo-European languages. This is assumed to have taken place in approximately the mid-first millennium BCE in the [[pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe|pre-Roman Northern European Iron Age]].&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1993 |title=Languages of the World: Germanic languages | encyclopedia=The New Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc |location=Chicago, IL, United States |isbn=0-85229-571-5}} This long-standing, well-known article on the languages can be found in almost any edition of ''Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germanic languages are traditionally divided into three groups: [[East Germanic languages|East]] (now extinct), [[West Germanic languages|West]], and [[North Germanic languages|North]] Germanic.&lt;ref name=Hawkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=John A.|chapter=Germanic languages|pages=68–76|editor=[[Bernard Comrie]]|title=The World's Major Languages|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1987|isbn=0-19-520521-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remained mutually intelligible throughout the [[Migration Period]]. Dutch is part of the West Germanic group, which also includes English, [[Scots language|Scots]], [[Frisian languages|Frisian]], [[Low German]] (Old Saxon) and [[High German languages|High German]]. It is characterized by a number of [[phonology|phonological]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] innovations not found in North or East Germanic.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Orrin W.|title=Old English and Its Closest Relatives|isbn=0-8047-2221-8|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Germanic varieties of the time are generally split into three dialect groups: [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]] (North Sea Germanic), [[Istvaeones|Istvaeonic]] (Weser-Rhine Germanic) and [[Irminones|Irminonic]] (Elbe Germanic). It appears that the Frankish tribes fit primarily into the Istvaeonic dialect group with certain Ingvaeonic influences towards the northwest, which are still seen in modern Dutch.

===Frankish (3rd century – present)===
{{main article|Frankish language}}
The Frankish language itself is poorly attested. A notable exception is the [[Bergakker inscription]], found near the Dutch city of [[Tiel]], which may represent a primary record of 5th-century Frankish. Although some place names recorded in Roman texts such as ''{{lang|frk|vadam}}'' (modern Dutch: ''{{lang|nl|wad}}'', English: "mudflat"), could arguably be considered as the oldest single "Dutch" words, the Bergakker inscription yields the oldest evidence of Dutch morphology. However, there is no consensus on the interpretation of the rest of the text.&lt;ref name="Willemyns"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dutch: Biography of a Language |first=Roland |last=Willemyns |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-932366-1 |pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Franks]] emerged in the southern Netherlands ([[Salian Franks]]) and central Germany ([[Ripuarian Franks]]), and later descended into [[Gaul]]. The name of [[Francia|their kingdom]] survives in that of France. Although they ruled the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Romans]] for nearly 300 years, their language, [[Frankish language|Frankish]], became extinct in most of France and was replaced by later forms of the language throughout Luxembourg and Germany in around the 7th century. It was replaced in France by [[Old French]] (a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] with a considerable Old Frankish influence). 

However, the Old Franconian language did not die out at large, as it continued to be spoken in the Low Countries, and subsequently evolved into what is now called Old Low Franconian or Old Dutch in the Low Countries. In fact, Old Frankish could be reconstructed from Old Dutch and Frankish loanwords in Old French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Icons of the Middle Ages : rulers, writers, rebels, and saints|last1=editor|first1=Lister M. Matheson|date=2012|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=0313340803|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Old Dutch (5th – 12th century)===
{{main article|Old Dutch}}
[[File:OldDutcharea.png|thumb|Area in which Old Dutch was spoken]]
Old Low Franconian or Old Dutch is regarded as the prime ancestor of a separate Dutch language. The "Low" in Old Low Franconian refers to the Low Countries, where Frankish was only minimally influenced by the [[High German consonant shift]] and the [[Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law]]. The High German consonant shift, moving over Western Europe from south to west, caused a differentiation with the [[High Franconian German|Central and High Franconian]] in Germany. The latter would as a consequence evolve (along with [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]], [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] and [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]]) into Old High German. At more or less the same time the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law, moving over Western Europe from west to east, led to the development of [[Old English]] (or Anglo-Saxon), [[Old Frisian]] and [[Old Saxon]]. Hardly influenced by either development, Old Dutch remained close to the original language of the Franks, the people that would rule Europe for centuries. The language did however experience developments of its own, such as very early [[final-obstruent devoicing]]. In fact, the find at Bergakker indicates that the language may already have experienced this shift during the Old Frankish period.

[[File:Gallee (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Utrecht baptismal vow]]

Attestations of Old Dutch sentences are extremely rare. The language is mostly recorded on fragmentary relics, and words have been reconstructed from Middle Dutch and loan words from Old Dutch in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary: Old Dutch&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest recorded is found in the [[Salic law]]. In this [[Franks|Frank]]ish document written around 510 the oldest Dutch sentence has been identified: ''Maltho thi afrio lito'' ("I say to you, I free you, serf") used to free a serf. Another old fragment of Dutch is ''Visc flot aftar themo uuatare'' ("A fish was swimming in the water"). The oldest conserved larger Dutch text is the [[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow|Utrecht baptismal vow]] (776–800) starting with ''Forsachistu diobolae&amp;nbsp;... ec forsacho diabolae'' ("Do you forsake the devil?&amp;nbsp;... I forsake the devil"). If only for its poetic content, the most famous Old Dutch sentence is probably ''[[Hebban olla vogala]] nestas hagunnan, hinase hic enda tu, wat unbidan we nu'' ("All birds have started making nests, except me and you, what are we waiting for"), is dated to around the year 1100, written by a Flemish [[monk]] in a convent in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], [[England]]. Since the sentence speaks to the imagination, it is often erroneously stated as the oldest Dutch sentence.

===Middle Dutch (12th – 15th century)===
{{main article|Middle Dutch}}
Old Dutch naturally evolved into [[Middle Dutch]]. The year 1150 is often cited as the time of the discontinuity, but it actually marks a time of profuse Dutch writing and during this period a rich [[Medieval Dutch literature]] developed. There was at that time no overarching [[standard language]]; Middle Dutch is rather a collective name for a number of closely related mutually intelligible dialects whose ancestor was Old Dutch. Where Old Dutch fragments are very hard to read for untrained Modern Dutch speakers, the various literary works of Middle Dutch are somewhat more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Besamusca|first1=Emmeline|last2=Verheul|first2=Jaap|title=Discovering the Dutch: on culture and society of the Netherlands|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789048526093|pages=239|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=GiJyBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=nl#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable difference between Old and Middle Dutch is in a feature of speech known as [[vowel reduction]]. Round vowels in word-final syllables are rather frequent in Old Dutch; in Middle Dutch, such vowels are leveled to a [[schwa]].

The Middle Dutch dialect areas were affected by political boundaries. The sphere of political influence of a certain ruler often also created a sphere of linguistic influence, with the language within the area becoming more homogenous. Following the contemporary political divisions they are in order of importance:
* [[West Flemish]] with the [[County of Flanders]] at its centre. It had been influential during the earlier Middle Ages (the "Flemish expansion") but lost prestige to the neighbouring Brabantian in the 13th century.
* [[Brabantian dialect|Brabantian]] (and related East Flemish), spoken primarily in the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and adjacent parts. It was an influential dialect during most of the Middle Ages, during the so-called "Brabantian expansion" in which the influence of Brabant was extended outwards into other areas.
* [[Hollandic dialect|Hollandic]], which had the [[County of Holland]] as its heartland, where originally [[Old Frisian]] was spoken. The people mixed with Frankish settlers from Flanders and Brabant and a new Frankish dialect with a Frisian [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrate]] developed. It was less influential during most of the Middle Ages but became more so in the 16th century during the "Hollandic expansion"; the [[Eighty Years' War]] took place in the Southern Netherlands during this period.
* [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]], spoken by the people in the modern-day provinces of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch]] and [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]], and adjacent lands in Germany. It was over time tied to different political areas and is therefore the most divergent of the dialects. It was even partly influenced by the High German consonant shift and is the most distant to the later developed standard language to which it contributed little. It was however the earliest Middle Dutch dialect that developed a literary tradition.
* Since it has Old Saxon and not Low Franconian (Old Dutch) as its ancestor, [[Dutch Low Saxon]] is not strictly a Dutch dialect. However, it was influenced by Middle Dutch since the 14th century and it did play a part in the formation of the standard Dutch language in later periods. It was spoken in the [[Overijssel#Oversticht|Oversticht]] territories of the [[episcopal principality of Utrecht]] and adjacent parts of [[Guelders]].

===Modern Dutch (15th century – present)===
[[File:Statenvertaling title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of the [[Statenvertaling]] (1637) reads: ''Biblia [...] Uyt de Oorspronckelijcke talen in onse Neder-landtsche tale getrouwelijck over-geset.''

From the Original languages into our Dutch language faithfully translated. With new added Clarifications of the dark passages, notes of the paralleled Texts, and new Indexes of both TESTAMENTS.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A process of [[standard language|standardisation]] started in the [[Middle Ages]], especially under the influence of the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] Ducal Court in Dijon ([[Brussels]] after 1477). The dialects of Flanders and Brabant were the most influential around this time. The process of standardisation became much stronger at the start of the 16th century, mainly based on the urban dialect of [[Antwerp]]. The 1585 [[fall of Antwerp]] to the Spanish army led to a flight to the northern Netherlands, where the [[Dutch Republic]] declared its independence from Spain. This influenced the urban dialects of the province of [[County of Holland]]. In 1637, a further important step was made towards a unified language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccjk.com/dutch-full-historical-junk/ |title=Dutch &amp; Other Languages |publisher=Ccjk.com |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Statenvertaling]], the first major Bible translation into Dutch, was created that people from all over the new republic could understand. It used elements from various, even [[Dutch Low Saxon]], dialects but was predominantly based on the urban dialects of Holland of post 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taal.phileon.nl/brabants.php |title=Taal in Nederland .:. Brabants |publisher=Taal.phileon.nl |accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Southern Netherlands]] (now Belgium and Luxembourg), developments were different. Under subsequent [[Spanish Netherlands|Spanish]], [[Austrian Netherlands|Austrian]] and [[French Revolutionary Wars|French rule]], the standardisation of Dutch language came to a standstill. The state, law, and increasingly education used French, yet more than half the Belgian population were speaking a variety of Dutch. In the course of the nineteenth century the [[Flemish Movement]] stood up for the rights of Dutch speakers, mostly which were referred to as "Flemish". However, the dialect variation was a serious disadvantage in the face of the standardised [[French language|francophonie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McRae|first1=Kenneth D.|title=Conflict and compromise in multilingual societies|date=1984|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|location=Waterloo, ON|isbn=0889201951|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since standardisation is a lengthy process, Dutch-speaking Belgium associated itself with the standard language that had already developed in the Netherlands over the centuries. Therefore, the situation in Belgium is essentially no different from that in the Netherlands, although there are recognisable differences in pronunciation, comparable to the pronunciation differences between standard British and standard American English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bramlett|first1=Edited by Frank|title=Linguistics and the Study of Comics|date=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=113700410X|pages=163|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 the Netherlands and Belgium concluded the [[Dutch Language Union|Language Union Treaty]]. This treaty lays down the principle that the two countries must gear their language policy to each other, among other things, for a common system of spelling.

Dutch belongs to its own [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] sub-group, the [[Low Franconian languages]], paired with its sister language Limburgish or East Low Franconian. Its closest relative is the [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] daughter language, Afrikaans. Other West Germanic languages related to Dutch are [[German language|German]], English and the [[Frisian languages]] and the un-standardised languages Low German and [[Yiddish]].

Dutch stands out in combining some [[Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law|Ingvaeonic characteristics]] (occurring consistently in English and Frisian and reduced in intensity from west to east over the [[continental West Germanic]] plane) with dominant Istvaeonic characteristics, of which some of them are also incorporated in German. Unlike German, Dutch (apart from Limburgish) has not been influenced at all by the south to north movement of the [[High German consonant shift]] and had some changes of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Maurer uses the term ''[[Istvaeones|Istvaeonic]]'' instead of Franconian; see Friedrich Maurer (1942), ''Nordgermanen und Alemannen: Studien zur germanischen und frühdeutschen Sprachgeschichte, Stammes- und Volkskunde'', Bern: Verlag Francke.&lt;/ref&gt; The cumulation of these changes resulted over time in separate, but related standard languages with various degrees of similarities and differences between them. For a comparison between the West Germanic languages, see the sections Morphology, Grammar and Vocabulary.

==Dialects==
{{Main article|Dutch dialects}}
Dutch [[dialect]]s are primarily the dialects that are both related with the Dutch language and are spoken in the same language area as the Dutch [[standard language]]. Although heavily under the influence of the standard language, some of them remain remarkably diverse and are found in the Netherlands and northern Belgium. The areas in which they are spoken often correspond with former mediaeval counties and duchies. The Netherlands (but not Belgium) distinguishes between a dialect and a ''streektaal'' ("[[regional language]]"). Those words are actually more political than linguistic because a regional language unites a large group of very different varieties. Such is the case with the [[Gronings dialect]], which is considered a variety of the Dutch Low Saxon regional language, but it is really very distinct from other Low Saxon varieties because of a Frisian substrate. Also, some Dutch dialects are more remote from the Dutch standard language than some varieties of a regional language are. Such is the case with West Flemish, which is considered a Dutch dialect but is far more remote from the standard language than most Dutch Low Saxon varieties are. Within the Netherlands, a further distinction is made between a regional language and a separate language, which is the case with the ([[standard language|standardised]]) [[West Frisian language]]. It is spoken alongside Dutch in the province of [[Friesland]].

Dutch dialects and regional languages are not spoken as often as they used to be, especially in the Netherlands. Recent research by Geert Driessen shows that the use of dialects and regional languages among both Dutch adults and youth is in heavy decline. In 1995, 27 percent of the Dutch adult population spoke a dialect or regional language on a regular basis, but in 2011, that was no more than 11 percent. In 1995, 12 percent of children of primary school age spoke a dialect or regional language, but in 2011, that had declined to 4 percent. Of the officially recognized regional languages Limburgish is spoken the most (in 2011 among adults 54%, among children 31%) and Dutch Low Saxon the least (adults 15%, children 1%). The decline of the [[West Frisian language]] in Friesland occupies a middle position (adults 44%, children 22%). Dialects are most often spoken in rural areas, but many cities have a distinct city dialect. For example, the city of [[Ghent]] has very distinct "g", "e" and "r" sounds that greatly differ from its surrounding villages. The [[Brussels]] dialect combines Brabantian with words adopted from [[Walloon language|Walloon]] and [[French language|French]].

Some dialects had, until recently, extensions across the borders of other standard language areas. In most cases, the heavy influence of the standard language has broken the [[dialect continuum]]. Examples are the [[Gronings dialect]] spoken in [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] as well as the closely related varieties in adjacent [[East Frisia]] (Germany). [[South Guelderish]] (''Zuid-Gelders'') is a dialect spoken in [[Gelderland]] (Netherlands) and the closely related varieties in adjacent parts of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (Germany). [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] (''Limburgs'') is spoken in [[Limburg (Belgium)]] as well as in [[Limburg (Netherlands)]] and extends across the German border. West Flemish (''Westvlaams'') is spoken in [[West Flanders]], the western part of [[Zeelandic Flanders]] and also in [[French Flanders]], where it virtually became extinct to make way for French.[[File:Dutch-dialects.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Dutch dialects&lt;br&gt;

===Dialect groups===
The '''[[West Flemish]]''' group of dialects, spoken in [[West Flanders]] and [[Zeeland]], is so distinct that it might be considered as a separate language variant, although the strong significance of language in Belgian politics would prevent the government from classifying them as such. An oddity of the dialect is that, the [[voiced velar fricative]] (written as "g" in Dutch) shifts to a [[voiced glottal fricative]] (written as "h" in Dutch), while the letter "h" becomes mute (just like in French). As a result, when West Flemings try to talk Standard Dutch, they're often unable to pronounce the g-sound, and pronounce it similar to the h-sound. This leaves, for example, no difference between "held" (hero) and "geld" (money). Or in some cases, they are aware of the problem, and hyper-correct the "h" into a voiced velar fricative or g-sound, again leaving no difference. The West Flemish variety historically spoken in adjacent parts in France is sometimes called [[French Flemish]] and is listed as a French [[minority language]], however only a very small and aging minority of the French-Flemish population still speaks and understands West Flemish.

'''[[Hollandic dialect|Hollandic]]''' is spoken in [[Holland]] and [[Utrecht]], though the original forms of this dialect (which were heavily influenced by a West Frisian [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]] and, from the 16th century on, by [[Brabantian dialect]]s) are now relatively rare. The urban dialects of the [[Randstad]], which are Hollandic dialects, do not diverge from standard Dutch very much, but there is a clear difference between the city dialects of [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[Utrecht]]. In some rural Hollandic areas more authentic Hollandic dialects are still being used, especially north of Amsterdam. Another group of dialects based on Hollandic is that spoken in the cities and larger towns of [[Friesland]], where it partially displaced [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] in the 16th century and is known as [[Stadsfries dialects|Stadsfries]] ("Urban Frisian").

'''[[Brabantian language|Brabantian]]''' is named after the historical [[Duchy of Brabant]], which corresponded mainly to the provinces of [[North Brabant]] and southern [[Gelderland]], the Belgian provinces of [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]] and [[Flemish Brabant]], as well as Brussels (where its native speakers have become a minority) and the province of [[Walloon Brabant]]. Brabantian expands into small parts in the west of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]] while its strong influence on the [[East Flemish]] of [[East Flanders]] and eastern [[Zeelandic Flanders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ELL2|Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; weakens towards the west. In a small area in the northwest of North Brabant ([[Willemstad (North Brabant)|Willemstad]]), [[Hollandic]] is spoken. Conventionally, the [[South Guelderish]] dialects are distinguished from Brabantian, but there are no objective criteria apart from geography to do so. Over 5 million people live in an area with some form of Brabantian being the predominant colloquial language out of the area's 22 million Dutch-speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://statbel.fgov.be/nl/statistieken/cijfers/bevolking/structuur/woonplaats/oppervlakte_dichtheid/ Belgium FOD economy Statbel] official demographic statistics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/bevolking/cijfers/default.htm Netherlands gouvernement CBS] official demographic statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Limburgish language|Limburgish]]''', spoken in both [[Limburg (Belgium)|Belgian Limburg]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Netherlands Limburg]] and in adjacent parts in Germany, is considered as a dialect in Belgium, while having obtained the status of official regional language in the Netherlands.

===Regional languages===
The '''[[Dutch Low Saxon]]''' dialect area, comprising the provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Drenthe]] and [[Overijssel]], and parts of the province of [[Gelderland]] as well. The [[IJssel]] roughly forms the linguistic watershed here. This group, which is not Low Franconian but instead Low Saxon and close to neighbouring Low German, has been elevated by the Netherlands (and by Germany) to the legal status of ''streektaal'' ([[regional language]]) according to the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. It is regarded as Dutch for a number of reasons. From the 14th to 15th century onward, its urban centers ([[Deventer]], [[Zwolle]], [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]], [[Zutphen]] and [[Doesburg]]) have been increasingly influenced by the western written Dutch and became a linguistically mixed area. From the 17th century onward, it was gradually integrated into the Dutch language area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roland |last= Willemyns |title=Dutch: Biography of a Language| year=2013 |publisher=OUP USA |isbn=0199858713}}, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch Low Saxon used to be at one end of the Low German [[dialect continuum]]. However, the national border has given way to dialect boundaries coinciding with a political border, because the traditional dialects are strongly influenced by the national standard varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Markku Filppula, Juhani Klemola, Marjatta Palander, Esa Penttilä}} (2005): ''Dialects Across Borders: Selected papers from the 11th International Conference on Methods in Dialectology (Methods XI)'', John Benjamins Publishing, {{ISBN|9027294046}}, 9789027294043, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-the-border dialects now separated by a plain gap also include [[South Guelderish]] and Limburgish on the Dutch side of the border and [[Meuse-Rhenish]] on the German side of the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Folkert de Vriend, Charlotte Giesbers, Roeland van Hout &amp; Louis ten Bosch}} (2009): ''The Dutch–German dialect border: relating linguistic, geographic and perceptual distances, in: the International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing, Special Issue on Language Variation''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Limburgish language|Limburgish]]''' has the status of official regional language (or ''streektaal'') in the [[Netherlands]] and Germany, but not in Belgium. It receives protection by chapter 2 of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Limburgish has been influenced by the [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] varieties like the [[Colognian dialect]], and has had a somewhat different development since the late Middle Ages.

===Daughter and sister languages===
'''Afrikaans''', although to a significant degree mutually intelligible with Dutch, is not a dialect but a separate [[standard language|standardised language]]. It is spoken in South Africa and Namibia. As a daughter language of Dutch, Afrikaans evolved mainly from 17th century Dutch dialects, but was influenced by various [[Afrikaans#History|other languages]] in South Africa.

'''[[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]''' (''Westerlauwers Fries''), along with [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]] and [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]], evolved from the same branch of the [[West Germanic languages]] as [[Old English]] (i.e. [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]]) and are therefore genetically more closely related to English and Scots than to Dutch. The different influences on the respective languages, however, particularly that of Norman French on English and Dutch on West Frisian, have rendered English quite distinct from West Frisian, and West Frisian less distinct from Dutch than from English. Although under heavy influence of the Dutch standard language, it is not mutually intelligible with Dutch and considered a [[sister language]] of Dutch, like English and German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=PhD|first1=William F.

Dutch is an [[official language]] of the Netherlands proper, Belgium, Suriname, the Dutch Caribbean municipal (St. Eustatius Saba &amp; Bonaire), [[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]]. Dutch is also an official language of several international organisations, such as the [[European Union]], [[Union of South American Nations]]&lt;ref name="verdrag"&gt;[http://www.mre.gov.br/Portuguese/imprensa/nota_detalhe3.asp?ID_RELEASE=5466] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206044736/http://www.mre.gov.br/Portuguese/imprensa/nota_detalhe3.asp?ID_RELEASE=5466|date=December 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Caribbean Community]]. At an academic level, Dutch is taught in about 175 universities in 40 countries. About 15,000 students worldwide study Dutch at university.&lt;ref name="vraag"&gt;{{cite web|language=nl|url=http://taalunieversum.org/onderwijs/vragen/antwoord/37/|title= Hoeveel studenten studeren er jaarlijks Nederlands aan universiteiten buiten het taalgebied?|publisher= Nederlandse Taalunie|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
In Europe, Dutch is the majority language in the Netherlands (96%) and Belgium (59%) as well as a minority language in Germany and northern France's French Flanders, where it is in the ultimate stage of [[language death]]. Though Belgium as a whole is multilingual, the two regions into which the country is divided ([[Flanders]], francophone [[Wallonia]], bilingual [[Brussels]] and small "facility" zones) are largely monolingual. The Netherlands and Belgium produce the vast majority of [[music]], [[film]]s, [[book]]s and other media written or spoken in Dutch.&lt;ref name="trots"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taalunieversum.org/taalpeil/2005/hoe_trots_zijn_wij_op_het_nederlands.html |title=Hoe trots zijn wij op het Nederlands? |publisher=Taalunieversum.org |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch is a [[Pluricentric language|monocentric language]], with all speakers using the same [[standardization|standard form]] (authorized by the [[Dutch Language Union]]) based on a [[Dutch orthography]] employing the [[Latin alphabet]] when writing. In stark contrast to its written uniformity, Dutch lacks a [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige dialect]] and has a large dialectal continuum consisting of 28 main dialects, which can themselves be further divided into at least 600 distinguishable varieties.&lt;ref&gt;M. van der Wal, ''Geschiedenis van het Nederlands'', 1992. {{ISBN|90-274-1839-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. van den Berg, ''Morfologische Atlas van de Nederlandse Dialecten'', 2008. {{ISBN|9053567747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the Netherlands and Belgium, the dialect around the German town of [[Kleve]] ([[South Guelderish]]) both historically and genetically belongs to the Dutch language. In North-Western France, the area around [[Calais]] was historically Dutch-speaking (West Flemish), of which an estimated 20,000 are daily speakers. The cities of [[Dunkirk]], [[Gravelines]] and [[Bourbourg]] only became predominantly French-speaking by the end of the 19th century. In the countryside, until [[World War I]], many elementary schools continued to teach in Dutch, and the Catholic Church continued to preach and teach the [[catechism]] in Dutch in many parishes.&lt;ref name="hugo"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jmmd/023/0022/jmmd0230022.pdf |format=PDF |title=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development |publisher=Multilingual-matters.net |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 19th century, Dutch was banned from all levels of education by both [[Prussia]] and France and lost most of its functions as a cultural language. In both Germany and France, the Dutch standard language is largely absent, and speakers of these Dutch dialects will use German or French in everyday speech. Dutch is not afforded legal status in France or Germany, either by the central or regional public authorities, and knowledge of the language is declining among younger generations.&lt;ref name="ec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/neerlandes/an/i1/i1.html |title=Flemish in France |publisher=Uoc.edu |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[foreign language]], Dutch is mainly taught in primary and secondary schools in areas adjacent to the Netherlands and [[Flanders]]. In [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking Belgium]], over 300,000 pupils are enrolled in Dutch courses, followed by over 23,000 in the [[States of Germany|German states]] of [[Lower Saxony]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], and about 7,000 in the [[Regions of France|French region]] of [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] (of which 4,550 are in primary school).&lt;ref name="wereldwijd" /&gt; At an academic level, the largest number of faculties of ''neerlandistiek'' can be found in Germany (30 universities), followed by France (20 universities) and the United Kingdom (5 universities).&lt;ref name="wereldwijd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taalunieversum.org/taalpeil/2005/nederlands_studeren_wereldwijd.html |title=Nederlands studeren wereldwijd |publisher=Taalunieversum.org |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neerlandistiek wereldwijd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neerlandistiek.taalunieversum.org/ |title=Neerlandistiek wereldwijd |publisher=Neerlandistiek.taalunieversum.org |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia and Australasia ===
====Asia====
Despite the Dutch presence in Indonesia for almost 350&amp;nbsp;years, as the Asian bulk of the [[Dutch East Indies]], the Dutch language has no official status there&lt;ref&gt;Baker (1998), p.202.&lt;/ref&gt; and the small minority that can speak the language fluently are either educated members of the oldest generation, or employed in the legal profession,&lt;ref&gt;Ammon (2005), p.2017.&lt;/ref&gt; as certain [[law code]]s are still only available in Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Booij (1999), p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch is taught in various educational centres in [[Indonesia]], the most important of which is the Erasmus Language Centre (ETC) in [[Jakarta]]. Each year, some 1,500 to 2,000 students take Dutch courses there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taalunieversum.org/en/dutch_worldwide/ |title=Dutch worldwide |publisher=Taalunieversum |date=December 20, 2012 |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, several thousand Indonesians study Dutch as a foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taalunieversum.org/taalunie/waar_ben_je_nou_nederlands_leren_in_indonesie/ |title=Taalunie &amp;#124; Beleidsorganisatie voor het Nederlands |publisher=Taalunieversum.org |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to centuries of Dutch rule in [[Indonesia]], many old documents are written in Dutch. Many universities therefore include Dutch as a source language, mainly for law and history students.&lt;ref name="indonesia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taalunieversum.org/taalunie/indonesie/ |title=Taalunie &amp;#124; Beleidsorganisatie voor het Nederlands |publisher=Taalunieversum.org |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Indonesia this involves about 35,000 students.&lt;ref name="vraag" /&gt;

Unlike other European nations, the Dutch chose not to follow a policy of language expansion amongst the indigenous peoples of their colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Language, identity, and marginality in Indonesia: the changing nature of ritual speech on the Island of Sumba |publisher=Cambridge University Press |author=Joel Corneal Kuipers |page=9 |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-q6gqIOQNAC |accessdate=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last quarter of the 19th century, however, a local elite gained [[Language proficiency|proficiency]] in Dutch so as to meet the needs of expanding bureaucracy and business.&lt;ref name="kol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knaw.nl/publicaties/pdf/971136.pdf |title=Westerse koloniale taalpolitiek in Azië: het Nederlands, Portugees, Spaans, Engels en Frans in vergelijkend perspectief |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=October 1, 2013 |accessdate=August 12, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325104245/http://www.knaw.nl/publicaties/pdf/971136.pdf |archivedate=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Dutch government remained reluctant to teach Dutch on a large scale for fear of destabilising the colony. Dutch, the language of power, was supposed to remain in the hands of the leading elite.&lt;ref name="kol" /&gt;

After independence, Dutch was dropped as an official language and replaced by Malay. Yet the [[Indonesian language]] inherited many words from Dutch: words for everyday life as well as scientific and technological terms.&lt;ref&gt;Sneddon (2003), p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar argues that 20% of Indonesian words can be traced back to Dutch words,&lt;ref name="mai"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/ies/050208/ |title=A Hidden Language&amp;nbsp;– Dutch in Indonesia |author=Hendrik M. Maier |date=February 8, 2005 |work=Institute of European Studies |publisher= University of California |location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which are transliterated to reflect phonetic pronunciation e.g. ''{{wiktnl|kantoor}}'' "office" in Indonesian is ''kantor'', while ''bus'' "bus" becomes ''bis''. In addition, many Indonesian words are [[calque]]s of Dutch; for example, ''rumah sakit'' "hospital" is calqued on the Dutch ''ziekenhuis'' (literally "sickhouse"), ''kebun binatang'' "zoo" on ''dierentuin'' (literally "animal garden"), ''undang-undang dasar'' "constitution" from ''grondwet'' (literally "ground law"). These account for some of the [[Differences between Malay and Indonesian#Vocabulary differences|differences in vocabulary]] between Indonesian and Malay.

====Australasia====
After the declaration of independence of Indonesia, [[Western New Guinea]], the "wild east" of the [[Dutch East Indies]], remained a Dutch colony until 1962, known as [[Netherlands New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827197-1,00.html |title=Indonesia: Fight over the Papuans |publisher=TIME |date=December 29, 1961 |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite prolonged Dutch presence, the Dutch language is not spoken by many Papuans, the colony having been ceded to Indonesia in 1963.

Dutch-speaking immigrant communities can also be found in Australia and New Zealand. The [[Census in Australia|2011 Australian census]] showed 37,248 people speaking Dutch at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation//download?format=xls&amp;collection=Census&amp;period=2006&amp;productlabel=Language%20Spoken%20at%20Home%20by%20Sex&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&amp;areacode=0 |title=Census Home |publisher=Censusdata.abs.gov.au |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2006 New Zealand census]], 26,982 people, or 0.70 percent of the total population, reported to speak Dutch to sufficient fluency that they could hold an everyday conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stats.co.nz/~/media/Statistics/Publications/Census/2006-reports/quickstats-subject/Culture-Identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity-tables.xls |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517194534/http://www.stats.co.nz/~/media/Statistics/Publications/Census/2006-reports/quickstats-subject/Culture-Identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity-tables.xls |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 17, 2016 |title= 2006 Census Data – QuickStats About Culture and Identity – Tables |publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]] |accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the colonies in the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]], from the second half of the 19th century onwards, the Netherlands envisaged expansion of Dutch in its colonies in the [[Caribbean|West Indies]]. Until 1863, when [[slavery]] was abolished in the West Indies, slaves were forbidden to speak Dutch, with the effect that local creoles such as [[Papiamento]] and [[Sranan Tongo]] which were based not on Dutch but rather other European languages, became common in the Dutch West Indies. However, as most of the people in the [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Colony of Surinam]] (now [[Suriname]]) worked on Dutch plantations, this reinforced the use of Dutch as a means for direct communication.&lt;ref name="kol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="taalunie"&gt;[http://taalunieversum.org/taalunie/toelichting_bij_de_overeenkomsttekst/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828214003/http://taalunieversum.org/taalunie/toelichting_bij_de_overeenkomsttekst/|date=August 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Suriname]] today, Dutch is the sole official language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ns.html#People |title=CIA – The World Factbook – Suriname |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 60&amp;nbsp;percent of the population speaks it as a [[First language|mother tongue]].&lt;ref name="taalgebied"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taalunieversum.org/taalpeil/2005/het_nederlandse_taalgebied.html |title=Het Nederlandse taalgebied |accessdate=November 4, 2008 |publisher=Nederlandse Taalunie |year=2005 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch is the obligatory medium of instruction in schools in Suriname, even for non-native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taalunieversum.org/onderwijs/suriname/ver_weg_of_dichtbij/ |title=Documentaire |publisher=Taalunieversum |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further twenty-four percent of the population speaks Dutch as a [[second language]].&lt;ref&gt;Source: Zevende algemene volks- en woningtelling 2004, Algemeen Bureau voor de Statistiek&lt;/ref&gt; Suriname gained its independence from the Netherlands in 1975 and has been an associate member of the [[Dutch Language Union]] since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taalunieversum.org/en/about_us/ |title=About us |publisher=Taalunieversum.org |date=January 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lingua franca]] of Suriname, however, is [[Sranan Tongo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=srn |title=Ethnologue on Sranan |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoken natively by about a fifth of the population.&lt;ref name="trots" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Recognition of Surinamese-Dutch (''Surinaams-Nederlands'') as an equal natiolect was expressed in 1976 by the publication of the ''Woordenboek van het Surinaams-Nederlands – een geannoteerde lijst van Surinaams-Nederlandse woorden en uitdrukkingen'' (''Dictionary of Surinam Dutch – an annotated list of Surinam-Dutch words and expressions''), see Johannes van Donselaar ''Woordenboek van het Surinaams-Nederlands – een geannoteerde lijst van Surinaams-Nederlandse woorden en uitdrukkingen'', Utrecht : Instituut A. W. de Groot voor Algemene Taalwetenschap van de Rijksuniversiteit te Utrecht (1976), Amsterdam, E.T.Rap (1977) {{ISBN|90-6005-125-4}}, published in 1989 as the ''Woordenboek van het Surinaams-Nederlands'' (''Dictionary of Surinam Dutch''), by Van Donselaar, and later by the publication of the ''Woordenboek Surinaams Nederlands'' (''Dictionary Surinam Dutch'') in 2009 (editor Renata de Bies, in cooperation with lexicologists Willy Martin en Willy Smedts), which was previously published as the ''Woordenboek van de Surinaamse Bijdrage aan het Nederlands'' (''Dictionary of the Surinam Contribution to Dutch"'').&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]], all parts of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], Dutch is the official language but spoken as a first language by only 7% to 8% of the population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html#People |title=CIA – The World Factbook – Aruba |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although most native-born people on the islands can speak the language since the education system is in Dutch at some or all levels.

In the United States, a now extinct dialect of Dutch, [[Jersey Dutch]], spoken by descendants of 17th-century Dutch settlers in Bergen and Passaic counties, was still spoken as late as 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/185/a12.html |title=Jersey Dutch |publisher=Bartleby.com |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Dutch-based creole languages]] once spoken in the Americas include [[Mohawk Dutch]] (in [[Albany, New York]]), [[Berbice Creole Dutch|Berbice]] (in Guyana), [[Skepi Creole Dutch|Skepi]] (in [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo, Guyana]]) and [[Negerhollands]] (in the [[United States Virgin Islands]]). [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] is not a member of the set of Dutch dialects and is less misleadingly called [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://german.about.com/library/blgermyth07.htm |title=German Myth 7 – Pennsylvania Dutch or German? |publisher=German.about.com |date=April 10, 2012 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Van Buren]], the eighth [[President of the United States]], spoke Dutch as his first language and is the only U.S. President to have spoken a language other than English as his first language. Dutch prevailed for many generations as the dominant language in parts of [[New York (state)|New York]] along the [[Hudson River]]. Another famous American born in this region who spoke Dutch as a first language was [[Sojourner Truth]].

According to the [[2000 United States Census|2000 United States census]], 150,396 people spoke Dutch at home,&lt;ref name = "US Census"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&amp;mode=lang_tops&amp;SRVY_YEAR=2000&amp;lang_id=610 |title=Dutch |publisher=Mla.org |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while according to the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Canadian census]], this number reaches 160,000 Dutch speakers.&lt;ref name="Statcan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=89189&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=705&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=70&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;GID=837928 |title=Statistics Canada 2006 (Dutch and Flemish grouped together) |publisher=2.statcan.ca |date=July 4, 2011 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an academic level, 20 universities offer Dutch studies in the United States.&lt;ref name="wereldwijd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neerlandistiek wereldwijd"/&gt; In Canada, Dutch is the fourth most spoken language by farmers, after English, French and German,&lt;ref name="farmers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/081202/dq081202a-eng.htm |title=Agriculture-population linkage data for the 2006 Census.

The largest legacy of the Dutch language lies in South Africa, which attracted large numbers of Dutch, Flemish and other northwest European farmer (in Dutch, ''[[boer]]'') settlers, all of whom were quickly assimilated.&lt;ref name="deumert"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ciimg5gGqQC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Afrikaans+%22lingua+franca+in+Namibia%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=gaUpvrVcEm&amp;sig=YaGtetmel-PqXQU2U4FLZJr0FFA&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA25,M1 |title=Language Standardization and Language Change: The Dynamics of Cape Dutch |accessdate=November 10, 2008 |work=Ana Deumert |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long isolation from the rest of the Dutch-speaking world made the Dutch as spoken in Southern Africa evolve into what is now Afrikaans.&lt;ref name="coetzee"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.dbnl.org/arch/coet003stan01_01/pag/coet003stan01_01.pdf |title=Standaard Afrikaans |accessdate=September 17, 2014 |work=Abel Coetzee |publisher=Afrikaner Pers |year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, the first Afrikaans newspaper called ''[[Die Afrikaanse Patriot]]'' was published in the Cape Colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Die verhaalskat van Ons Klyntji (1896–1905) |author=Abel Jacobus Coetzee |publisher=Voortrekkerpers |year=1940 |location=Johannesburg |language=af |oclc=63430958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European Dutch remained the [[literary language]]&lt;ref name="coetzee" /&gt; until the start of the 1920s, when under pressure of [[Afrikaner nationalism]] the local "African" Dutch was preferred over the written, European-based standard.&lt;ref name="deumert" /&gt; In 1925, section 137 of the 1909 constitution of the [[Union of South Africa]] was amended by Act 8 of 1925, stating "the word ''Dutch'' in article 137&amp;nbsp;... is hereby declared to include Afrikaans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/south_africa/01_laws.php |title=South Africa: Legislation: 1910–2015 |publisher=Archontology.org |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourtofappeal.gov.za/speeches/mpati.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816125902/http://www.supremecourtofappeal.gov.za/speeches/mpati.pdf|date=August 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution of 1983 only listed English and Afrikaans as official languages.

Both languages are still largely mutually intelligible, although this relation can in some fields (such as lexicon, spelling and grammar) be asymmetric, as it is easier for Dutch speakers to understand written Afrikaans than it is for Afrikaans speakers to understand written Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/21/4/543 |title=Oxford Journal on Mutual Comprehensibility of Written Afrikaans and Dutch |publisher=Llc.oxfordjournals.org |date=August 27, 2006 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afrikaans is grammatically far less complex than Dutch, and vocabulary items are generally altered in a clearly patterned manner, e.g. ''vogel'' becomes ''voël'' ("bird") and ''regen'' becomes ''reën'' ("rain").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Name (Required): |url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/language/about/afrikaans.html |title=The Afrikaans Language |publisher=Kwintessential.co.uk |date=August 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907035914/http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/language/about/afrikaans.html |archivedate=September 7, 2012 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, the number of students following Dutch at university is difficult to estimate, since the academic study of Afrikaans inevitably includes the study of Dutch.&lt;ref name="vraag" /&gt; Elsewhere in the world, the number of people learning Dutch is relatively small.

===Consonants===
Unlike other Germanic languages, Dutch doesn't have phonological [[Aspirated consonants|aspiration of consonants]].&lt;ref&gt;Frans Hinskens, Johan Taeldeman, ''[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=t8jmBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=frisian%20substrate%20dutch&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA66#v=snippet&amp;q Language and space: Dutch]'', Walter de Gruyter 2014. 3110261332, 9783110261332, p.66&lt;/ref&gt; Like most Germanic languages, the Dutch [[consonant]] system did not undergo the [[High German consonant shift]] and has a [[syllable]] structure that allows fairly complex [[consonant cluster]]s. Dutch also retains full use of the [[velar consonant|velar]] [[fricative]]s that were present in [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], but lost or modified in many other Germanic languages. Dutch has [[final-obstruent devoicing]]: at the end of a word, voicing distinction is neutralised and all obstruents are pronounced voiceless. For example, Dutch ''{{lang|nl|goede}}'' (̇‘good’) is {{IPA|/ˈɣudə/}} but the related form ''{{lang|nl|goed}}'' is {{IPA|/ɣut/}}. Dutch shares this [[final-obstruent devoicing]] with German (the Dutch noun ''goud'' is pronounced [ɣɑut], the adjective ''gouden'' is pronounced [ɣɑudə(n)], like the German noun ''Gold'', pronounced [ɡɔlt], adjective ''golden'', pronounced [ɡɔldn] vs English ''gold'' and ''golden'', both pronounced with [d].)

Voicing of pre-vocalic initial [[voiceless alveolar fricative]]s occurs, although less in Dutch than in German (Dutch ''{{lang|nl|zeven}}'', German ''{{lang|de|sieben}}'' with {{IPA|[z]}} versus English ''seven'' and Low German ''{{lang|nds|seven}}'' with [s]), and also the shift {{IPA|/θ/}} → {{IPA|/d/}}. Dutch shares only with Low German the development of {{IPA|/xs/}} → {{IPA|/ss/}} (Dutch ''{{lang|nl|vossen}}'', ''{{lang|nl|ossen}}'' and Low German ''{{lang|nds|Vösse}}'', ''{{lang|nds|Ossen}}'' versus German ''{{lang|de|Füchse}}'', ''{{lang|de|Ochsen}}'' and English ''foxes'', ''oxen''), and also the development of {{IPA|/ft/}} → {{IPA|/xt/}} though it is far more common in Dutch (Dutch ''{{lang|nl|zacht}}'' and Low German ''{{lang|nds|sacht}}'' versus German ''{{lang|de|sanft}}'' and English ''soft'', but Dutch ''{{lang|nl|kracht}}'' versus German ''{{lang|de|Kraft}}'' and English ''craft'').

Notes:
* {{IPA|[ʔ]}} is not a separate phoneme in Dutch, but is inserted before vowel-initial syllables within words after {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}} and often also at the beginning of a word.
* The realization of {{IPA|/r/}} phoneme varies considerably from dialect to dialect and even between speakers in the same dialect area. Common realisations are an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}, [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}}, [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[ʀ]}}, [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}}, and [[alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ]}}.
* The realization of {{IPA|/ʋ/}} also varies somewhat by area and speaker. The main realisation is a [[labiodental approximant]] {{IPA|[ʋ]}}, but some speakers, particularly in the south, use a [[Voiced bilabial fricative|bilabial approximant]] {{IPA|[β̞]}} or a [[Voiced labio-velar approximant|labiovelar approximant]] {{IPA|[w]}}.
* The lateral {{IPA|/l/}} is slightly velarized postvocalically in most dialects, particularly in the north.&lt;ref name="verhoeven2005"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Verhoeven|2005|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/ɣ/}} may be true velars {{IPA|[x]}} and {{IPA|[ɣ]}}, uvular {{IPA|[χ]}} and {{IPA|[ʁ]}} or palatal {{IPA|[ç]}} and {{IPA|[ʝ]}}. The more palatal realisations are common in southern areas, while uvulars are common in the north.
* Some northern dialects have a tendency to devoice all fricatives regardless of environment. This is particularly common with {{IPA|/ɣ/}} but can affect others as well.
* {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ʒ/}} are not native phonemes of Dutch, and usually occur in borrowed words, like ''{{lang|nl|show}}'' and ''{{lang|nl|bagage}}'' (‘baggage’), but may occur in situations where {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} are palatalised.
* {{IPA|/ɡ/}} is not a native phoneme of Dutch and only occurs in borrowed words, like ''{{lang|fr|garçon}}''.

===Vowels===
Like English, Dutch did not develop [[i-mutation]] as a morphological marker and shares with most Germanic languages the lengthening of short [[vowel]]s in [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]ed open [[syllable]]s, which has led to contrastive [[vowel length]] that is used as a [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] marker. Dutch has an extensive [[vowel]] inventory. Vowels can be grouped as back rounded, front unrounded and front rounded. They are also traditionally distinguished by [[Vowel length|length]] or [[tenseness]].

Vowel length is not always considered a distinctive feature in Dutch phonology, because it normally co-occurs with changes in vowel quality. One feature or the other may be considered redundant, and some phonemic analyses prefer to treat it as an opposition of [[tenseness]]. However, even if not considered part of the phonemic opposition, the long/tense vowels are still realised as ''phonetically'' longer than their short counterparts. The changes in vowel quality are also not always the same in all dialects, and in some there may be little difference at all, with length remaining the primary distinguishing feature. And while it is true that older words always pair vowel length with a change in vowel quality, new loanwords have reintroduced phonemic oppositions of length. Compare ''zonne(n)'' {{IPA|[ˈzɔnə]}} ("suns") versus ''zone'' {{IPA|[ˈzɔːnə]}} ("zone") versus ''zonen'' {{IPA|[ˈzoːnə(n)]}} ("sons"), or ''kroes'' {{IPA|[krus]}} ("mug") versus ''cruise'' {{IPA|[kruːs]}} ("cruise").

Notes:
* The distinction between {{IPA|/i y u/}} and {{IPA|/iː yː uː/}} is only slight, and may be considered allophonic for most purposes. However, some recent loanwords have introduced distinctively long {{IPA|/iː yː uː/}}, making the length distinction marginally phonemic.
* The long close-mid vowels {{IPA|/eː øː oː/}} are realised as slightly closing diphthongs {{IPA|[eɪ øʏ oʊ]}} in many northern dialects.
* The long open-mid vowels {{IPA|/ɛː œː ɔː/}} only occur in a handful of loanwords, mostly from French. In certain Belgian Dutch varieties they may also occur as realisations of {{IPA|/ɛi œy au/}}.&lt;ref name="verhoeven2005" /&gt;
* The long close and close-mid vowels are often pronounced more closed or as centering diphthongs before an {{IPA|/r/}} in the syllable coda. This may occur before coda {{IPA|/l/}} as well.

===Diphthongs===
{{See also|IJ (digraph)}}
Unique to the development of Dutch is the collapse of older ''ol''/''ul''/''al'' + [[dental consonant|dental]] into ''ol'' + dental, followed by vocalisation of pre-[[consonant]]al /l/ and after a short vowel, creating the diphthong {{IPA|/ɑu/}} e.g., Dutch ''goud'', ''zout'' and ''bout'' corresponds with Low German ''Gold'', ''Solt'', ''Bolt''; German ''Gold'', ''Salz'', ''Balt'' and English ''gold'', ''salt'', ''bolt''. This is the most common diphthong along with {{IPA|/ɛi œy/}}. All three are commonly the only ones considered unique phonemes in Dutch. The tendency for native English speakers is to pronounce Dutch names with {{IPA|/ɛi/}} (written as ''ij'' or ''ei'') as {{IPA |/aɪ/}}, (like the English vowel y) which does not normally lead to confusion among native listeners, since in a number of dialects (e.g. in Amsterdam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tussentaalenbeeld.nl/A60bb.htm|title=Onderzoek naar de volkstaal in de Jordaan|website=www.tussentaalenbeeld.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the same pronunciation is heard.

In contrast, {{IPA|/ɑi/}} and {{IPA|/ɔi/}} are rare in Dutch, and occur only in some words. The "long/tense" diphthongs, while they are indeed realised as proper diphthongs, are generally analysed phonemically as a long/tense vowel followed by a glide {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/ʋ/}}. All diphthongs end in a close vowel ({{IPA|/i y u/}}). They are grouped here by their first element.

===Phonotactics===
The [[syllable structure]] of Dutch is (C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C). Many words, as in English, begin with three consonants; for example, straat {{IPA|/straːt/}} ''(street)''. There are words that end in four consonants, e.g., ''herfst'' {{IPA|/ɦɛrfst/}} 'autumn', ''ergst'' {{IPA|/ɛrxst/}} 'worst', ''interessantst'' 'most interesting', ''sterkst'' {{IPA|/stɛrkst/}} 'strongest', the last three of which are [[superlative]] adjectives.

The highest number of consonants in a single cluster is found in the word ''sle'''chtstschr'''ijvend'' {{IPA|/ˈslɛxtstˌsxrɛi̯vənt/|}} 'writing worst' with 7 consonant phonemes. Similar is ''angstschreeuw'' {{Audio-IPA|angstschreeuw.ogg|/ˈɑŋstsxreːu̯/}} "scream in fear", with six in a row.

A notable change in pronunciation has been occurring in younger generations in the provinces of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], [[North Holland|North]] and [[South Holland]], which has been dubbed "Polder Dutch" by Jan Stroop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cf.hum.uva.nl/poldernederlands/english/stjohnspaper_engels.htm |author=Stroop, Jan |title=Young Women's Farewell to Standard Dutch |date=October 1999 |work=Poldernederlands |accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These speakers pronounce {{angle bracket|ij/ei}}, {{angle bracket|ou/au}}, and {{angle bracket|ui}}, which used to be pronounced as {{IPA|/ɛi/}}, {{IPA|/ɔu/}}, and {{IPA|/œy/}}, increasingly lowered, as {{IPA|[ai]}}, {{IPA|[au]}}, and {{IPA|[ay]}} respectively. Instead, {{IPA|/eː/}}, {{IPA|/oː/}}, and {{IPA|/øː/}} are pronounced as [[diphthong]]s now, as {{IPA|[ei]}}, {{IPA|[ou]}}, and {{IPA|[øy]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Basisbegrippen Fonetiek en Fonologie|last=Decoster &amp; Smessart|first=Wivine &amp; Hans|publisher=Acco|year=2012|isbn=978-90-334-8576-3|location=Leuven|pages=91|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, which makes this change an instance of a [[chain shift]].

This change is interesting from a sociolinguistic point of view because it has apparently happened relatively recently, in the 1970s, and was pioneered by older well-educated women from the upper middle classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neon.niederlandistik.fu-berlin.de/en/nedling/taalgeschiedenis/taalverandering_in_de_19e_en_20e_eeuw/ |title=History of the Dutch Language: Language change in the 19th and 20th century |publisher=Neon.niederlandistik.fu-berlin.de |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowering of the diphthongs has long been current in many Dutch dialects, and is comparable to the English [[Great Vowel Shift]], and the diphthongisation of long high vowels in Modern [[German language|High German]], which centuries earlier reached the state now found in Polder Dutch. Stroop theorizes that the lowering of open-mid to open diphthongs is a phonetically "natural" and inevitable development and that Dutch, after having diphthongised the long high vowels like German and English, "should" have lowered the diphthongs like German and English as well.

Instead, he argues, this development has been artificially frozen in an "intermediate" state by the standardisation of Dutch pronunciation in the 16th century, where lowered diphthongs found in rural dialects were perceived as ugly by the educated classes and accordingly declared substandard. Now, however, in his opinion, the newly affluent and independent women can afford to let that natural development take place in their speech. Stroop compares the role of Polder Dutch with the urban variety of British English pronunciation called [[Estuary English]].

Among [[Belgian]] and [[Surinamese]] Dutch speakers and speakers from other regions in the Netherlands, this vowel shift is not taking place.

==Grammar==
{{Main article|Dutch grammar}}
{{See also|DT-Manie}}

Dutch is grammatically similar to [[German grammar|German]], such as in [[syntax]] and verb [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (for a comparison of verb morphology in English, Dutch and German, see [[Germanic weak verb]] and [[Germanic strong verb]]). [[Grammatical case]]s have largely fallen out of use and are now mostly limited to pronouns and a large number of [[set phrase]]s. Inflected forms of the articles are also often found in surnames and toponyms.

Standard Dutch uses three [[Gender in Dutch grammar|genders]] to differentiate between natural gender and three when discerning grammatical gender. But for most non-Belgian speakers, the masculine and feminine genders have merged to form the common gender (de), while the neuter (het) remains distinct as before. This gender system is similar to those of most [[North Germanic languages#Classification|Continental Scandinavian languages]]. As in English, but to a lesser degree, the inflectional grammar of the language (e.g., adjective and noun endings) has simplified over time.

===Verbs and tenses===
When grouped according to their conjugational class, Dutch has four main verb types: [[Germanic weak verb|weak verb]]s, [[Germanic strong verb|strong verb]]s, [[irregular verb]]s and mixed verbs.

Weak verbs are the most numerous verbs, constituting about 60% of all verbs. In weak verbs, the past tense and past participle are formed with a dental suffix:
* Weak verbs with past in ''-de''
* Weak verbs with past in ''-te''

Strong verbs are the second most numerous verb group. This group is characterised by a vowel alternation of the stem in the past tense and perfect participle. Dutch distinguishes between 7 classes of strong verbs with some internal variants. Dutch is known for its large group of 'half strong verbs' these have either a weak past tense and a strong participle or a strong past tense and a weak participle. Finally there are also strong verbs that don't neatly fit in any of the seven classes. The following table shows the vowel alternations in more detail. It also shows the number of roots (bare verbs) that belong to each class, variants with a prefix are excluded.

|}

In Dutch the irregular verbs are the least numerous, but most used verb forms.

===Genders and cases===
As in English, the case system of Dutch and the [[subjunctive]] have largely fallen out of use, and the system has generalised the [[dative]] over the [[accusative]] [[case (linguistics)|case]] for certain [[pronoun]]s (NL: ''me'', ''je''; EN: ''me'', ''you''; LI: ''mi'', ''di'' vs. DE: ''mich/mir'', ''dich/dir''). While standard Dutch has three [[Gender in Dutch grammar|grammatical genders]], this has few grammatical consequences and the masculine and feminine gender are often merged into a common gender in the Netherlands but not in Belgium (EN: none; NL/LI: common and neuter; in Belgium masculine, feminine and neuter is in use).

Modern Dutch has mostly lost its case system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zeergoeddutch.com/cases/en |title=Grammatical Cases in Dutch |publisher=Zeer Goed Dutch |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain idioms and expressions continue to include now archaic case declensions. The article has just two forms, ''de'' and ''het'', more complex than English, which has only "the". The use of the older inflected form ''den'' in the dative or accusative as well as use of 'der' in the dative are restricted to numerous set phrases, surnames and toponyms.

|-
! Accusative
| de || de || het || de
|}

In modern Dutch, the genitive articles 'des' and 'der' are commonly used in [[idioms]]. Other usage is typically considered archaic, poetic or stylistic. In most circumstances, the preposition 'van' is instead used, followed by the normal definitive article 'de' or 'het'. For the idiomatic use of the articles in the genitive, see for example:
* Masculine singular: "'''des''' duivel'''s'''" (''lit: of the devil'') (common proverbial meaning: Seething with rage)
* Feminine singular: het woordenboek '''der''' Friese taal (''the dictionary of the Frisian language'')
* Neuter singular: de vrouw '''des''' huiz'''es''' (''the lady of the house'')
* Plural: de voortgang '''der''' werken (''the progress of (public) works'')

In contemporary usage, the [[genitive case]] still occurs a little more often with plurals than with singulars, as the plural article is 'der' for all genders and no special noun inflection must be taken account of. 'Der' is commonly used in order to avoid reduplication of 'van', e.g. ''het merendeel '''der''' gedichten '''van de''' auteur'' instead of ''het merendeel '''van de''' gedichten '''van de''' auteur'' ("the bulk of the author's poems").

There is also a genitive form for the pronoun ''die/dat'' ("that [one], those [ones]"), namely ''diens'' for masculine and neuter singulars (occurrences of ''dier'' for feminine singular and all plurals are extremely rare). Although usually avoided in common speech, this form can be used instead of possessive pronouns to avoid confusion. Compare:

* ''Hij vertelde over zijn zoon en '''zijn''' vrouw''. – He told about his son and '''his (own)''' wife.
* ''Hij vertelde over zijn zoon en '''diens''' vrouw''. – He told about his son and '''the latter's''' wife.

Analogically, the relative and interrogative pronoun ''wie'' ("who") has the genitive forms ''wiens'' and ''wier'' (corresponding to English "whose", but less frequent in use).

Dutch also has a range of fixed expressions that make use of the genitive articles, which can be abbreviated using apostrophes. Common examples include "'s ochtends" (with 's as abbreviation of des; ''in the morning'') and "desnoods" (lit: ''of the need'', translated: ''if necessary'').

The Dutch written grammar has simplified over the past 100 years: [[grammatical case|cases]] are now mainly used for the pronouns, such as ''ik'' (I), ''mij, me'' (me), ''mijn'' (my), ''wie'' (who), ''wiens'' (whose: masculine or neuter singular), ''wier'' (whose: feminine singular; masculine, feminine or neuter plural). Nouns and adjectives are not case inflected (except for the genitive of proper nouns (names): -s, -'s or -'). In the spoken language cases and case inflections had already gradually disappeared from a much earlier date on (probably the 15th century) as in many continental West Germanic dialects.

Inflection of adjectives is more complicated. The adjective receives no ending with indefinite neuter nouns in singular (as with ''een'' {{IPA|/ən/}} 'a/an'), and -e in all other cases. (This was also the case in Middle English, as in "a goode man".) Note that ''fiets'' belongs to the masculine/feminine category, and that ''water'' and ''huis'' are neuter.

{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
! Indefinite&lt;br /&gt;(with indefinite article or&lt;br /&gt;no article and no pronoun)
| een mooi'''e''' fiets (a beautiful bicycle)&lt;br /&gt;koud'''e''' soep (cold soup) || een mooi huis (a beautiful house)&lt;br /&gt;koud water (cold water) || mooi'''e''' fietsen (beautiful bicycles)&lt;br /&gt;mooi'''e''' huizen (beautiful houses)
|}

An adjective has no '''e''' if it is in the [[Predicative (adjectival or nominal)|predicative]]: ''De soep is koud''.

More complex inflection is still found in certain lexicalized expressions like ''de heer de'''s''' hui'''zes''''' (literally, the man of the house), etc. These are usually remnants of cases (in this instance, the genitive case which is still used in German, cf. ''Der Herr des Hauses'') and other inflections no longer in general use today. In such lexicalized expressions remnants of strong and weak nouns can be found too, e.g. ''in het jaar des Her'''en''''' (Anno Domini), where "-en" is actually the genitive ending of the weak noun. Also in this case, German [[German grammar#Irregular declensions|retains this feature]].

===Word order===
Dutch shares much of its word order with German. Dutch exhibits [[subject–object–verb]] word order, but in main clauses the [[Dutch conjugation|conjugated verb]] is moved into the second position in what is known as verb second or [[V2 word order]]. This makes Dutch word order almost identical to that of German, but often different from English, which has [[subject–verb–object]] word order and has since lost the V2 word order that existed in [[Old English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~kroch/omev2-html/omev2-html.html |title=Verb Movement in Old and Middle English: Dialect Variation and Language Contact |publisher=Ling.upenn.edu |date=January 20, 1995 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example sentence used in some Dutch language courses and textbooks is "''Ik kan mijn pen niet vinden omdat het veel te donker is''", which translates into English word for word as "''I can my pen not find because it far too dark is''", but in standard English word order would be written "''I cannot find my pen because it is far too dark''". If the sentence is split into a main and subclause and the verbs highlighted, the logic behind the word order can be seen.

Main clause: "''Ik '''kan''' mijn pen niet '''vinden''' ''"

Verbs are placed in the final position, but the conjugated verb, in this case "kan" (can), is made the second element of the clause.

Subclause: "''omdat het veel te donker '''is''' ''"

The verb or verbs always go in the final position.

In an [[interrogative]] main clause the usual word order is: conjugated verb followed by subject; other verbs in final position:
:"''Kun jij je pen niet vinden?''" (literally "''Can you your pen not find?''") "''Can't you find your pen?''"
In the Dutch equivalent of a [[wh-question]] the word order is: interrogative pronoun (or expression) + conjugated verb + subject; other verbs in final position:
:"''Waarom kun jij je pen niet vinden?''" ("''Why can you your pen not find?''") "''Why can't you find your pen?''"
In a [[tag question]] the word order is the same as in a declarative clause:
:"''Jij kunt je pen niet vinden?''" ("''You can your pen not find?''") "''You can't find your pen?''"
A subordinate clause does not change its word order:
:"''Kun jij je pen niet vinden omdat het veel te donker is?''" ("''Can you your pen not find because it far too dark is?''") "''Can you not find your pen because it's far too dark?''"

===Diminutives===
{{See also|List of diminutives by language#Dutch}}
In Dutch, the diminutive is used extensively. It is the nuances of meaning expressed by the diminutive which make it peculiarly unique Dutch but also difficult to master for non-native speakers. It is a very productive&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;{{cite book|first=Bruce|last=Donaldson|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=aFN9AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Dutch: A Comprehensive Grammar|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|ISBN=9781134082360}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} and formed by adding one of the [[affix|suffixes]] to the noun in question, depending on the latter's phonological ending:
* '''-je''' for ending in -b, -c, -d, -t, -f, -g, -ch, -k, -p, -v, -x, -z or -s: neef → neef'''je''' (''male cousin'', ''nephew'')
* '''-pje''' for ending in -m: boom (''tree'') → boom'''pje'''
* '''-kje''' for ending in -ing: koning (''king'') → konin'''kje''' (the 'ng'-sound transforms into 'nk'), but vondeling → vondeling'''etje''' (''foundling'')
* '''-{{Not a typo|tje}}''' for ending in -h, -j, -l, -n, -r, -w, or a vowel other than -y: zoen → zoen'''{{Not a typo|tje}}''' (''kiss''). A single open vowel is doubled when adding "-{{Not a typo|tje}}" would change the pronunciation: aut'''o''' → aut'''oo'''{{Not a typo|tje}} (''car'').
*'''-′{{Not a typo|tje}}''' for ending in -y and for abbreviations: baby → baby'{{Not a typo|tje}}, cd → cd'{{Not a typo|tje}}, [[A4 paper|A4]] → A4'{{Not a typo|tje}}
* '''-etje''' for ending in -b, -l, -n, -ng or -r preceded by a "short" (lax) vowel: bal → ball'''etje''' (''ball''). Final consonant is doubled (except for -ng) to preserve the vowel's shortness.

The diminutive suffixes '''-ke''' (from which '''-{{Not a typo|tje}}''' has derived by [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]]), '''-eke''', '''-ske''', '''-{{Not a typo|ie}}''' (only for words ending -ch, -k, -p, or -s), '''-kie''' (instead of -kje), and '''-pie''' (instead of -pje) are used in southern dialects, and the forms ending on -{{not a typo|ie}} as well in northern urban dialects. Some of these form part of expressions that became standard language, like ''een makkie'', from ge'''mak''' = ''ease''). The noun joch (''young boy'') has, exceptionally, only the diminutive form jochie, also in standard Dutch. The form -ke is also found in many women's given names: Janneke, Marieke, Marijke, Mieke, Meike etc.

In Dutch, the diminutive is not merely restricted to nouns, but can be applied to [[numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] (''met z'n tweetjes'', "the two of us"), [[pronoun]]s (''onderonsje'', "tête-à-tête"), [[verb|verbal particle]]s (''moetje'', "shotgun marriage"), and even [[preposition]]s (''toetje'', "dessert").&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;{{rp|64–65}} Most notable however, are the diminutive forms of [[adjective]]s and [[adverbs]]. The former take a diminutive ending and thus function as nouns, the latter remain adverbs and always have the diminutive with the '''-s''' appended, e.g. adjective: groen ("green") → noun: groen'''{{Not a typo|tje}}''' ("rookie"); adverb: even ("just") → adverb: even'''tjes''' ("just a minute").

Some nouns have two different diminutives, each with a different meaning: bloem (''flower'') → bloem'''pje''' (lit. "small flower"), but bloem'''etje''' (lit. also "small flower", meaning ''[[flower bouquet|bouquet]]''). A few nouns exist solely in a diminutive form, e.g. zeepaardje (''[[seahorse]]''), while many, e.g. meisje (''girl''), originally a diminutive of meid (''maid''), have acquired a meaning [[:nl:wikt:Categorie:Zelfstandig verkleinwoord|independent of their non-diminutive forms]]. A diminutive can sometimes be added to an uncountable noun to refer to a single portion: ijs (''ice'', ''ice cream'') → ijsje (''ice cream treat'', ''cone of ice cream''), bier (''beer'') → biertje. Some diminutive forms only exist in the plural, e.g. kleertjes (''clothing'').

When used to refer to time, the Dutch diminutive form can indicate whether the person in question found it pleasant or not: ''een uur'''tje''' kletsen'' (''chatting for a "little" hour.'') The diminutive can, however, also be used pejoratively: ''Hij was weer eens het "mannetje"''. (''He acted as if he was the "little" man.'')

===Pronouns and determiners===
There are two series of personal pronouns, subject and objects pronouns. The forms on the right-hand sides within each column are the unemphatic forms; those not normally written are given in brackets. Only ''ons'' and ''u'' do not have an unemphatic form. The distinction between emphatic and unemphatic pronouns is very important in Dutch.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;{{rp|67}} [[Emphatic pronoun]]s in English use the [[reflexive pronoun]] form, but are used to emphasize the subject, not to indicate a direct or indirect object. For example, "I gave (to) myself the money" is reflexive but "I myself gave the money (to someone else) " is emphatic.

|}
Like in English, Dutch has generalised the dative over the accusative case for all pronouns, e.g. Du me, je, Eng me, you, vs. Germ mich/mir dich/dir. There is one exception: the standard language prescribes that in the third person plural, ''hen'' is to be used for the direct object, and ''hun'' for the indirect object. This distinction was artificially introduced in the 17th century by grammarians, and is largely ignored in spoken language and not well understood by Dutch speakers. Consequently, the third person plural forms ''hun'' and ''hen'' are interchangeable in normal usage, with ''hun'' being more common. The shared unstressed form ''ze'' is also often used as both direct and indirect objects and is a useful avoidance strategy when people are unsure which form to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onzetaal.nl/advies/hunhen.php |title=''Hun'' of ''hen''? |work=Onze Taal Taaladviesdienst |accessdate=May 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch shares also with English the presence of h- pronouns, e.g. Du ''hij'', ''hem'', ''haar'', ''hun'' and Eng ''he'', ''him'', ''her'' vs. Germ ''er'', ''ihn'', ''ihr'', ''ihnen''.

===Compounds===
[[File:Bord Hemelwaterinfiltratiegebied.JPG|thumb|Dutch language street sign in the Netherlands]]

Like most Germanic languages, Dutch forms noun [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]], where the first noun modifies the category given by the second (''hondenhok'' = doghouse). Unlike English, where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in open form with separating spaces, Dutch (like the other Germanic languages) either uses the closed form without spaces (''boomhut'' = tree house) or inserts a hyphen (''VVD-coryfee'' = outstanding member of the VVD, a political party). Like German, Dutch allows arbitrarily long compounds, but the longer they get, the less frequent they tend to be.

The longest serious entry in the [[Van Dale]] dictionary is {{Audio|Nl-BE-Wapenstilstandsonderhandeling.oga|''wapenstilstandsonderhandeling''}} (ceasefire negotiation). Leafing through the articles of association (Statuten) one may come across a 30-letter {{Audio|Nl-BE-Vertegenwoordigingsbevoegdheid.oga|''vertegenwoordigingsbevoegdheid''}} (authorisation of representation). An even longer word cropping up in official documents is ''ziektekostenverzekeringsmaatschappij'' (health insurance company) though the shorter ''ziektekostenverzekeraar'' (health insurer) is more common.

Notwithstanding official spelling rules, some Dutch-speaking people, like some Scandinavians and German speakers, nowadays tend to write the parts of a compound separately, a practice sometimes dubbed ''de Engelse ziekte'' (the English disease).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spatiegebruik.nl/ |title=SOS – Signalering Onjuist Spatiegebruik |publisher=Spatiegebruik.nl |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary ==
Dutch vocabulary is predominantly Germanic in origin, with loanwords accounting for 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=HnKeVbwTwyYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en |title=Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook |page=[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=HnKeVbwTwyYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA349#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 349] |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main foreign influence on Dutch vocabulary since the 12th century and culminating in the [[French period]] has been French and (northern) [[Langues d'oïl|Oïl languages]], accounting for an estimated 6.8% of all words, or more than a third of all loanwords. [[Latin language|Latin]], which was spoken in the southern Low Countries for centuries, and subsequently played a major role as the language of science and religion, follows with 6.1%. High German and Low German were influential until the mid-19th century and account for 2.7%, but these are mostly unrecognizable since many have been "Dutchified", e.g. German ''{{lang|de|Fremdling}}'' → Dutch ''{{lang|nl|vreemdeling}}''. From English Dutch has borrowed words since the middle of the 19th century, as a consequence of the increasing power and influence of Britain and the United States. The share of English loanwords is about 1.5%, but this number is still on the increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=HnKeVbwTwyYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en |title=Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook |page=[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=HnKeVbwTwyYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA352#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 352] |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Dutch contributed many loanwords to English, accounting for 1.3% of its lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=HnKeVbwTwyYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en |title=Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook |page=[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=HnKeVbwTwyYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 370] |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official spelling is set by the ''Wet schrijfwijze Nederlandsche taal'' (Law on the writing of the Dutch language; Belgium 1946, Netherlands 1947; based on a 1944 spelling revision; both amended in the 1990s after a 1995 spelling revision). The ''Woordenlijst Nederlandse taal'', more commonly known as "het groene boekje" (i.e. "the green booklet", because of its color), is usually accepted as an informal explanation of the law.

Dutch is written using the [[Latin script]]. Dutch uses one additional character beyond the standard alphabet, the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] [[IJ (digraph)|IJ]]. It has a relatively high proportion of doubled letters, both vowels and consonants, due to the formation of compound words and also to the spelling devices for distinguishing the many vowel sounds in the Dutch language. An example of five consecutive doubled letters is the word ''voorraaddoos'' ([[food storage container]]). The [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (Dutch: ''trema'') is used to mark vowels that are pronounced separately when involving a pre- or suffix, and a [[hyphen]] is used when the problem occurs in compound words. For example; "''be''ïnvloed" (influenced), but ''zee-eend'' (sea duck). Generally, other [[diacritic|diacritical marks]] occur only in loanwords. However, the [[acute accent]] can also be used for emphasis or to differentiate between two forms, and its most common use is to differentiate between the indefinite [[article (grammar)|article]] 'een' (a, an) and the numeral 'één' (one).

'''Elsa Beskow''' (''née'' '''Maartman''') (11{{nbsp}}February 1874{{snd}}30{{nbsp}}June 1953) was a [[Swedes|Swedish]] author and illustrator of [[Children's literature|children's books]]. Among her better known books are ''Tale of the Little Little Old Woman'' and ''Aunt Green, Aunt Brown and Aunt Lavender''.&lt;ref&gt;Hammar, Stina ''Solägget: fantasi och verklighet Elsa Beskows konst'' (Bonnier, Stockholm 2002) {{ISBN|91-0-057914-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Born in [[Stockholm]] her parents were businessman Bernt Maartman (1841–1889), whose family came from [[Bergen]], Norway, and Augusta Fahlstedt (1850–1915). Beskow studied Art Education at [[Konstfack]], University College of Arts, Crafts and Design, then called ''Tekniska skolan'', or the Technical school, in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;Björkman, Ivar; ''Djursholm – staden på landet'' (Djursholms Forntid och Framtid, 1982) ISBN /91-85549-00-2&lt;/ref&gt;

She married former minister and social worker, doctor of theology [[Natanael Beskow]] in 1897. Elsa Beskow met her future husband at [[Djursholms samskola]] while serving as a teacher where he served as head master. From 1900 they lived in Villa Ekeliden in [[Djursholm]] which had initially been built for the author [[Viktor Rydberg]]. They had six sons, including the artist Bo Beskow (1906–1989) and geologist Gunnar Beskow (1901–1991).

== Career ==
In 1894 Beskow started to contribute to the children's magazine ''Jultomten''. Overall, she would publish  some forty books with her own text and images. Beskow frequently combined reality with elements from the fairy tale world. Children meet elves or goblins, and farm animals talk with people. Central themes were the relationships between children and adults and children's independent initiative.

Beskow became one of the most well known of all Swedish children's book artists. Many of her books became classics and are continually reprinted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ahlgren| first =Stig | authorlink = Stig Ahlgren | title =Insnöad: Läsning i blandade ämnen | publisher = [[Rabén &amp; Sjögren]] | year = 1977| location =Ystad | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 9789129479195| page =138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beskow also illustrated ABC books and songbooks for Swedish schools. Her book pages are often framed by decorative framework of the [[Art Nouveau]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/beskow.htm |title=Elsa Beskow |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727173040/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/beskow.htm |archivedate=27 July 2010 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poem ==
[[File:Elsa Beskow - Sov du lilla videung, än så är det vinter... - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illustrated poem about trees in winter (early 1900s, Nationalmuseum Stockholm.)]]
&lt;poem&gt;
Sof du lilla vide ung,
än så är det vinter.
Än så sofva björk och ljung
ros och hyacinter.
Än så är det långt till vår,
innan rönn i blomning står.
Sof du lilla vide,
än så är det vinter.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Legacy==
The Elsa Beskow Award was created in 1958 to recognize the year's best Swedish picture book illustrator.&lt;ref name="Silvey1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anita Silvey|title=Children's Books and Their Creators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=graiX5o4tMYC&amp;pg=PA59|year=1995|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-395-65380-0|pages=59–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3281">Some family names contain clues as to their origin, like '''English surnames of Norman Origin'''.&lt;ref name=From/&gt;  William, [[Duke of Normandy]], successfully invaded England in 1066, and this invasion left a lasting legacy in the English language, in general, and in surnames, in particular.  

According to Christopher Daniell, in ''From Norman Conquest to Magna Carta'', 1140 marked what might be the first recorded use of a modern surname, inherited by multiple generations.  The sons of a Norman named Robert used a modern inheritable surname, ''[[FitzGerald (surname)|FitzGerald]]'', in honour of an earlier relative, named ''Gerald''.&lt;ref name=From/&gt;

According to Joslin Fiennes's ''Origins of English surnames'' modern surnames were not used until the fourteenth century:&lt;ref name=OriginsOfEnglishSurnames/&gt;
:{| class="wikitable"
|
:''"Surnames exploded into the records in the late fourteenth century, and document a unique history of ordinay medieval society during a short period of extraordinary social change.  The roots of the names tell you the language people spoke then. It is a well-stirred mix of Old English, Middle English and Norman French, with some Norse and Celt, in which it is English that dominates.  To see it in context, Norman French was the language of power and rank until Henry IV made English the tongue of kings at the end of the fourteenth century when most surnames already existed."''&lt;ref name=OriginsOfEnglishSurnames/&gt;
|}
Beginning in the late 1500s and peaking in the wake of the  Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), French [[Protestant]] refugees from [[France]], the [[Huguenots]], brought surnames like [[Dubarry (disambiguation)|Dubarry]], [[Duhamel (disambiguation)|Duhamel]] and [[Dupuy (surname)|Dupuy]], from [[Normandy]], into the English namespace, when the historical record shows these names had not been present prior to the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name=OriginsOfEnglishSurnames/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7904">In [[mathematics]], the '''Erdős–Burr conjecture''' was a problem concerning the [[Ramsey number]] of [[sparse graph]]s. The conjecture is named after [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Stefan Burr]], and is one of many [[Erdős conjecture|conjectures named after Erdős]]; it states that the Ramsey number of graphs in any sparse family of graphs should [[linear growth|grow linearly]] in the number of [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of the graph.

The conjecture was proven by Choongbum Lee (thus it is now a theorem).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lee|2017}}; {{harvtxt|Kalai|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
If ''G'' is an [[undirected graph]], then the [[Degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]] of ''G'' is the minimum number ''p'' such that every subgraph of ''G'' contains a vertex of degree ''p'' or smaller.  A graph with degeneracy ''p'' is called ''p''-degenerate. Equivalently, a ''p''-degenerate graph is a graph that can be reduced to the [[empty graph]] by repeatedly removing a vertex of degree ''p'' or smaller.

It follows from [[Ramsey's theorem]] that for any graph ''G'' there exists a least integer 
&lt;math&gt;r(G)&lt;/math&gt;, the ''Ramsey number'' of ''G'', such that any [[complete graph]] on at least &lt;math&gt;r(G)&lt;/math&gt; [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] whose [[graph theory|edges]] are coloured red or blue contains a monochromatic copy of ''G''. For instance, the Ramsey number of a triangle is 6: no matter how the edges of a complete graph on six vertices are colored red or blue, there is always either a red triangle or a blue triangle.

==The conjecture==
In 1973, [[Stefan Burr]] and [[Paul Erdős]] made the following conjecture:

:For every integer ''p'' there exists a constant ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' so that any ''p''-degenerate graph ''G'' on ''n'' vertices has Ramsey number at most ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;n''.

That is, if an ''n''-vertex graph ''G'' is ''p''-degenerate, then a monochromatic copy of ''G'' should exist in every two-edge-colored complete graph on ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;n'' vertices.

==Known results==
Before the full conjecture was proved, it was first settled in some special cases. It was proven for bounded-degree graphs by {{harvtxt|Chvátal|Rödl|Szemerédi|Trotter|1983}}; their proof led to a very high value of ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, and improvements to this constant were made by {{harvtxt|Eaton|1998}} and {{harvtxt|Graham|Rödl|Rucínski|2000}}. More generally, the conjecture is known to be true for ''p''-arrangeable graphs, which includes graphs with bounded maximum degree, [[planar graph]]s and graphs that do not contain a [[subdivision (graph theory)|subdivision]] of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rödl|Thomas|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known for subdivided graphs, graphs in which no two adjacent vertices have degree greater than two.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Alon|1994}}; {{harvtxt|Li|Rousseau|Soltés|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For arbitrary graphs, the Ramsey number is known to be bounded by a function that grows only slightly superlinearly. Specifically, {{harvtxt|Fox|Sudakov|2009}} showed that there exists a constant ''c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that, for any ''p''-degenerate ''n''-vertex graph ''G'',
:&lt;math&gt;r(G) \leq 2^{c_p \sqrt{\log n}} n.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Eurotra''' was an ambitious [[machine translation]] project established and funded by the [[European Commission]] from 1978 until 1992.

Emboldened by modest success with an older, commercially developed machine translation system [[SYSTRAN]], a large network of European computational linguists embarked upon the Eurotra project with the hope of creating a state-of-the-art MT system for the then seven, later nine, official languages of the [[European Community]].

However, as time passed, expectations became tempered; "Fully Automatic High Quality Translation" was not a reasonably attainable goal. The true character of Eurotra was eventually acknowledged to be in fact pre-competitive research rather than prototype development.

The project was motivated by one of the founding principles of the EU: that all citizens had the right to read any and all proceedings of the Commission in their own language. As more countries joined, this produced a [[combinatorial explosion]] in the number of language pairs involved, and the need to translate every paper, speech and even set of meeting minutes produced by the EU into the other eight languages meant that translation rapidly became the overwhelming component in the administrative budget. To solve this problem Eurotra was devised.

The project was unusual in that rather than consisting of a single research team, it had member groups distributed around the member countries, organised along language rather than national lines (for example, groups in Leuven and Utrecht worked closely together), and the secretariat was based at the [[European Commission]] in [[Luxembourg]]. While this contributed significantly to the culture of the project, it also demonstrated graphically [[Frederick P. Brooks|Brooks]]' assertion in [[The Mythical Man-Month]] that adding personnel to a project results in it taking longer to complete; the more the number of groups involved, the more time is spent on administration and communication rather than actual research per se.

The actual design of the project was unusual as MT projects go. Older systems, such as SYSTRAN, were heavily dictionary-based, with minor support for rearranging word order. More recent systems have often worked on a probabilistic approach, based on parallel corpora. Eurotra addressed the [[constituent structure]] of the text to be translated, going through first a syntactic [[parse]] followed by a second parse to produce a dependency structure followed by a final parse with a third grammar to produce what was referred to internally as Intermediate Representation (IR). Since all three modules were implemented as [[Prolog]] programs, it would then in principle be possible to put this structure backwards through the corresponding modules for another language to produce a translated text in any of the other languages. However, in practice this was not in fact how language pairs were implemented.

The first "live" translation occupied a 4Mb [[Microvax]] running [[Ultrix]] and C-Prolog for a complete weekend some time in early 1987. The sentence, translated from [[English language|English]] into [[Danish language|Danish]], was "Japan makes computers". The main problem faced by the system was the generation of so-called "Parse Forests" - often a large number of different grammar rules could be applied to any particular  phrase, producing hundreds, even thousands of (often identical) parse trees. This used up huge quantities of computer store, slowing the whole process down unnecessarily.  

While Eurotra never delivered a "working"  MT system, the project made a far-reaching long-term impact on the nascent language industries in European member states, in particular among the southern countries of [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]]. There is at least one commercial MT system (developed by an academic/commercial consortium in [[Denmark]]) derived from Eurotra technology.

[[Facebook]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Netflix]] and [[Google]] ('''FAANG'''), a further extension of '''FANG''' (which originally did not include Apple), is both an acronym and a [[buzzword]] to entice investors, as popularised by [[Jim Cramer]] from [[CNBC]]'s [[Mad Money]] and other [[pundit|talking heads]] for grouping together currently high performance technology companies currently listed on [[NASDAQ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thestreet.com/story/14320244/1/fang-stocks-index.html |title= FANG Stocks Are Getting Their Own Index |first= Kinsey |last= Grant|publisher= [[TheStreet.com|The Street]] |date= Sep 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it usually refers to the five (or four) of these technology companies specifically, the term is now generally used to refer to the technology and [[Luxury goods|consumer discretionary]] sectors consisting of highly-traded growth stocks of [[United States|American]] technology and tech-enabled companies in recent years.&lt;ref name="fool"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Frankel |first1=Matthew |title=What Are the FANG Stocks? |url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/09/29/ask-a-fool-what-are-the-fang-stocks.aspx |accessdate=11 August 2018 |work=[[Motley Fool]] |date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a perspective of the market demonstrates a huge impact with commensurate profit or loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/facebook-stock-market.html |title= Facebook and Other Tech Companies Drag Down Stock Markets |first= Matt |last= Phillips |work= The New York Times |date= Mar 19, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinions have been divided over whether this phenomenon is indicative of a [[tech bubble]] or long-term sustained growth of these technology companies.&lt;ref name="fool" /&gt;

In 2017, [[Intercontinental Exchange]] has initiated an index with this focus through the [[NYSE]] and extended FANG with [[Twitter]], [[Nvidia]] and [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] and with BAT stocks, the [[China|Chinese]] counterparts: [[Baidu]], [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]] and [[Tencent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-fangs-vs-the-bats-which-is-more-vulnerable-to-a-downturn-1523983900 |title= The FANGs vs. the BATs: Which Is More Vulnerable to a Downturn? |first= Reshma |last= Kapadia |date= April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-08/fang-lovers-given-new-way-to-bet-on-stocks-with-futures-trading |title= FANG Lovers Get a New Way to Bet on Stocks With Futures Trading |first= Lu |last= Wang |date= Nov 8, 2017  |publisher= Barrons }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.investopedia.com/news/new-index-track-fang-stocks-nyse-ice-nyfang |title= New Index to Track FANG Stocks Will Launch in November [2017] |publisher= Investopedia |first= Nathan |last= Reiff |date= Sep 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= NYSE to Launch FANG+ Options on June 4; Offers Efficient Hedging and Exposure to Basket of Key Tech Stocks |url= https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nyse-to-launch-fang-options-on-june-4-offers-efficient-hedging-and-exposure-to-basket-of-key-tech-20180523-00716 |publisher= NASDAQ |series= Press release |date= May 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment analysts have often compared FAANG against or together with BAT stocks due to the latter's similar level of growth in the Chinese stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wong |first1=Jacky |title=BATs vs. FANGs: Why China’s Tech Has Extra Risk |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/bats-vs-fangs-why-chinas-tech-has-extra-risk-1507870793 |accessdate=15 August 2018 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also actively managed [[Exchange-traded fund|ETF]]s, which attempt to take advantage of the phenomenon of these index-based funds, since indices don’t have the power to make adjustments on any given day. However, investors should be wary as an ETF may not be currently holding all of the implied tech company stocks. For example, the ETF known by ticker FNG, sold out of Facebook during the [[Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal|Cambridge Analytica scandal]], but also dumped Apple holdings ahead of its earnings boost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-26/-f-is-for-this-etf-is-named-after-fangs-and-holds-no-facebook |title= 'F' is for?

The '''Final Solution''' ({{lang-de|Endlösung}}) or the '''Final Solution to the Jewish Question''' ({{lang-de|die Endlösung der Judenfrage}}, {{IPA-de|diː ˈɛntˌløːzʊŋ deːɐ̯ ˈjuːdn̩ˌfʁaːɡə|pron}}) was a [[Nazi German|Nazi]] plan for the [[genocide]] or extermination of the [[Jews]] during [[World War II]]. The "Final Solution of the [[Jewish Question]]" was the official [[code name]] for the murder of all Jews within reach, which was not restricted to the European continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Browning i |first=Christopher |year=2007 |title=The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 – March 1942|publisher= U of Nebraska Press. "In a brief two years between the autumn of 1939 and the autumn of 1941, Nazi Jewish policy escalated rapidly from the pre-war policy of forced emigration to the Final Solution as it is now understood—the systematic attempt to murder every last Jew within the German grasp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy of deliberate and systematic genocide starting across [[German-occupied Europe]] was formulated in procedural and geo-political terms by Nazi leadership in January 1942 at the [[Wannsee Conference]] held near Berlin,&lt;ref name=Wannsee&gt;{{cite web |title=Wannsee Conference and the Final Solution |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005477 |accessdate=30 March 2015 |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and culminated in [[the Holocaust]], which saw the killing of [[The Holocaust in Poland|90% of Polish Jews]],&lt;ref name="Wyman"&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Reacts to the Holocaust |author1=David S.

The nature and timing of the decisions that led to the Final Solution is an intensely researched and debated aspect of the Holocaust. The program evolved during the first 25 months of war leading to the attempt at "murdering every last Jew in the German grasp".{{r|Browning424}} Most historians agree, wrote [[Christopher Browning]], that the Final Solution cannot be attributed to a single decision made at one particular point in time.{{r|Browning424}} "It is generally accepted the decision-making process was prolonged and incremental."&lt;ref name=Browning213&gt;{{harvp|Browning|2004|p=213}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, following the [[Fall of France]], [[Adolf Eichmann#Transition from emigration to deportation|Adolf Eichmann]] devised the [[Madagascar Plan]] to move Europe's Jewish population to the French colony, but the plan was abandoned for logistical reasons, mainly [[Blockade of Germany (1939–45)|a naval blockade]].&lt;ref name="CRB/Path"/&gt; There were also preliminary plans to deport Jews to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Siberia]].{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=76}} In 1941, wrote [[Raul Hilberg]], in the first phase of the mass murder of Jews, the [[Einsatzgruppen|mobile killing units]] began to pursue their victims across occupied eastern territories; in the second phase, stretching across all of German-occupied Europe, the Jewish victims were sent on [[Holocaust train|death trains]] to centralized [[extermination camp]]s built for the purpose of systematic implementation of the Final Solution.{{r|Hilberg273}}

==Background==
The term "Final Solution" was a [[euphemism]] used by the Nazis to refer to their plan for the annihilation of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; Historians have shown that the usual tendency of the German leadership was to be extremely guarded when discussing the Final Solution. Euphemisms were, in [[Mark Roseman|Mark Roseman's]] words, "their normal mode of communicating about murder".{{sfnp|Roseman|2002|p=87}}

From gaining power in January 1933 until the [[World War Two|outbreak of war]] in September 1939, the Nazi persecution of the Jews in Germany was focused on intimidation, expropriating their money and property, and encouraging them to emigrate.&lt;ref name=MRo12/&gt; According to the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nazi Party policy statement]], the Jews, and Roma (although numerically fewer),{{r|Browning181}} were the only "alien people in Europe".&lt;ref name="Hancock"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Routledge History of the Holocaust |author=[[Ian Hancock]] |editor=Jonathan C.

Broadly speaking, the extermination of Jews was carried out in two major operations. With the onset of [[Operation Barbarossa]] launched from [[occupied Poland]] in June 1941, [[Einsatzgruppen|mobile killing units]] of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and [[Orpo battalions|Orpo]] were dispatched to [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet controlled territories of eastern Poland]] and further into the Soviet republics for the express purpose of killing all Jews, both Polish and Soviet. During the massive chase after the fleeing Red Army, [[Himmler]] himself visited [[Białystok]] in the beginning of July 1941, and requested that, "as a matter of principle, any Jew" behind the [[German-Soviet Frontier Treaty|German-Soviet frontier]] "was to be regarded as a partisan". His new orders gave the [[SS and police leader]]s full authority for the mass murder behind the front-lines. By August 1941, all Jewish men, women, and children were shot.{{sfnp|Longerich|2012|pp=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=GBQchepZ-7EC&amp;lpg=PA525&amp;vq=Bialystok%2Bprinciple&amp;pg=PA525&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=Bialystok%20principle&amp;f=false 525–33]}} In the second phase of annihilation, the Jewish inhabitants of central, western, and south-eastern Europe were transported by [[Holocaust trains]] to camps with newly-built gassing facilities. [[Raul Hilberg]] wrote: "In essence, the killers of the occupied USSR moved to the victims, whereas outside this arena, the victims were brought to the killers.

The plans to exterminate all the Jews of Europe was formalized at the [[Wannsee Conference|SS's guesthouse on the Wannsee]]{{sfnp|Longerich|2012|p=555}} near Berlin on 20 January 1942. The conference was chaired by Heydrich and attended by 15 senior officials of the [[Nazi Party]] and the German government. Most of those attending were representatives of the Interior Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and the Justice Ministry, including Ministers for the Eastern Territories.{{sfnp|Roseman|2002|pp=65–7}} At the conference, Heydrich indicated that approximately 11,000,000 Jews in Europe would fall under the provisions of the "Final Solution". This figure included not only Jews residing in Axis-controlled Europe, but also the Jewish populations of the United Kingdom, and of neutral nations (Switzerland, Ireland, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, and European Turkey).&lt;ref name=Wannsee/&gt; Eichmann's biographer [[David Cesarani]] wrote that Heydrich's main purpose in convening the conference was to assert his authority over the various agencies dealing with Jewish issues. "The simplest, most decisive way that Heydrich could ensure the smooth flow of deportations" to death camps, according to Cesarani, "was by asserting his total control over the fate of the Jews in the Reich and the east" under the single authority of the [[RSHA]].{{sfnp|Cesarani|2005|pp=110–1}} A copy of the minutes of this meeting was found by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in March 1947;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghwk.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf-wannsee/texte/protocol.pdf |title=Protocol of Conference on the final solution (Endlösung) of the Jewish question |accessdate=3 June 2014 |publisher=House of the Wannsee Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was too late to serve as evidence during the first [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Trial]], but was used by prosecutor General [[Telford Taylor]] in the [[subsequent Nuremberg Trials]].{{sfnp|Roseman|2002|pp=1–2}}

The Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union codenamed [[Operation Barbarossa]], which commenced on 22 June 1941, set in motion a "war of destruction" which quickly opened the door to systematic mass murder of European Jews.{{sfnp|Browning|2004|p=216}} For Hitler, [[Bolshevism]] was merely "the most recent and most nefarious manifestation of the eternal Jewish threat".{{sfnp|Browning|2004|p=224}} On 3 March 1941, [[Wehrmacht]] Joint Operations Staff Chief [[Alfred Jodl]] repeated Hitler's declaration that the "Jewish-Bolshevik intelligentsia would have to be eliminated" and that the forthcoming war would be a confrontation between two completely opposing cultures.{{sfnp|Hilberg|1985|p= 281}} In May 1941, [[Gestapo]] leader [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]] wrote a preamble to the new law limiting the jurisdiction of military courts in prosecuting troops for criminal actions because: "This time, the troops will encounter an especially dangerous element from the civilian population, and therefore, have the right and obligation to secure themselves."{{sfnp|Browning|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=d9Wg4gjtP3cC&amp;q=worldview#v=snippet&amp;q=worldview&amp;f=false 219]}}

Himmler assembled a force of about 3,000 men from [[Sicherheitspolizei|Security Police]], [[Gestapo]], [[Kriminalpolizei|Kripo]], [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], and the [[Waffen-SS]], as the so-called "special commandos of the security forces" known as the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', to eliminate both communists and Jews in occupied territories.{{sfnp|Browning|2004|p=217}} These forces were supported by 21 battalions of [[Orpo battalions|Orpo Reserve Police]] under [[Kurt Daluege]], adding up to 11,000 men.{{sfnp|Browning|2004|p=229}} The explicit orders given to the Order Police varied between locations, but for [[Police Battalion 309]] participating in the first mass murder of 5,500 Polish Jews in the Soviet-controlled [[Białystok Ghetto|Białystok]] (a Polish [[Białystok Voivodeship (1919–1939)|provincial capital]]), Major Weiss explained to his officers that Barbarossa is a war of annihilation against Bolshevism,{{sfnp|Browning|1998|p=11|ps=: On the eve of Operation Barbarossa Major Weiss disclosed to his men the directives of Hitler's [http://www.mrclancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Barbarossa-Decree.pdf 'Barbarossa Decree'.]}} and that his battalions would proceed ruthlessly against all Jews, regardless of age or sex.{{sfnp|Browning|2004|p=232}}

After crossing the [[German-Soviet Frontier Treaty|Soviet demarcation line]] in 1941, what had been regarded as exceptional in the Greater Germanic Reich became a normal way of operating in the east. The crucial taboo against the killing of women and children was breached not only in Białystok, but also in [[Gargždai]] in late June.{{sfnp|Browning|2004|p=260}} By July, significant numbers of women and children were being killed behind all front-lines not only by the Germans, but also by the local [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police|Ukrainian]] and [[Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions|Lithuanian auxiliary forces]].{{sfnp|Browning|2004|p=261}} On 29 July 1941, at a meeting of SS officers in [[Vileyka]] (Polish [[Wilno Voivodeship (1926–1939)|Wilejka]], now Belarus), the ''Einsatzgruppen'' had been given a dressing-down for their [[Einsatzgruppen reports|low execution figures]].

===''Distrikt Galizien''===
Historians find it difficult to determine precisely when the first concerted effort at annihilation of all Jews began in the last weeks of June 1941 during Operation Barbarossa.&lt;ref name=JWe/&gt; Dr. Samuel Drix (''Witness to Annihilation''), Jochaim Schoenfeld (''Holocaust Memoirs''), and several survivors of the [[Janowska concentration camp]], who were interviewed in the film ''Janovska Camp at Lvov'', among other witnesses, have argued that the Final Solution began in [[Lviv|Lwów]] (Lemberg) in ''Distrikt Galizien'' of the [[General Government]] during the German advance across [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Soviet-occupied Poland]]. Statements and memoirs of survivors emphasize that, when Ukrainian nationalists and ''[[ad hoc]]'' Ukrainian People's Militia (soon reorganized as the [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police]]) began to murder women and children, rather than only male Jews, the "Final Solution" had begun. Witnesses have said that such murders happened both prior to and during the [[Lviv pogroms|pogroms reportedly triggered by the NKVD prisoner massacre]]. The question of whether there was some coordination between the [[Lithuania]]n and Ukrainian militias remains open (i.e. collaborating for a joint assault in [[Kaunas|Kovno]], [[Vilnius|Wilno]], and Lwów).&lt;ref name=JWe&gt;{{cite book |first=Jakob |last=Weiss |title= [[The Lemberg Mosaic]] |contribution=Introduction |location= New York |publisher= Alderbrook Press |year= 2011 |via=https://www.amazon.com/Lemberg-Mosaic-Jakob-Weiss/dp/0983109109#reader_0983109109 Kindle |page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The killings continued uninterrupted. On 12 October 1941, [[Stanisławów Ghetto|in Stanisławów]], some 10,000–12,000 Jewish men, women, and children were shot at the Jewish cemetery by the German uniformed SS-men and Ukrainian Auxiliary Police during the so-called "Bloody Sunday" ''[[:de:Blutsonntag von Stanislau|(de)]]''.&lt;ref name="stanislawow"&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrea |last= Löw |date=10 June 2013 |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007236 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520064011/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007236 |archive-date= 20 May 2014 |title=Stanislawów (now Ivano-Frankivsk) |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |accessdate=29 January 2016 |quote=From ''The USHMM Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933–1945''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shooters began firing at 12 noon and continued without stopping by taking turns.

The conference at Wannsee gave impetus to the so-called ''second sweep'' of the Holocaust by the bullet in the east.

==Historiographic debate about the decision==
{{see also|Responsibility for the Holocaust}}
{{The Holocaust sidebar}}

Historians disagree as to when and how the Nazi leadership decided that the European Jews should be exterminated. The controversy is commonly described as the [[functionalism versus intentionalism]] debate which began in the 1960s, and subsided thirty years later. In the 1990s, the attention of mainstream historians moved away from the question of top executive orders triggering the Holocaust, and focused on factors which were overlooked earlier, such as personal initiative and ingenuity of countless functionaries in charge of the killing fields. No written evidence of Hitler ordering the Final Solution has ever been found to serve as a "smoking gun", and therefore, this one particular question remains unanswered.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite book |title=Holocaust Historiography in Context: Emergence, Challenges, Polemics and Achievements |first1=David |last1= Bankier |first2= Dan |last2= Mikhman |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2008 |isbn=9653083260 |page=330 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNzjTUT6jdYC&amp;q=smoking%2Bgun#v=snippet&amp;q=smoking%2Bgun&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler made numerous predictions regarding the Holocaust of the Jews of Europe prior to the beginning of World War II. During a speech given on 30 January 1939, on the sixth anniversary of his accession to power, Hitler said:

{{quote|Today I will once more be a prophet: If the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevization]] of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!|Adolf Hitler, 1939&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_holocaust/documents/part1/doc59.html |title=Extract from the Speech by Hitler, 30 January 1939 |first=Adolf |last=Hitler |date=30 January 1939 |publisher=YadVashem.org }} ''[Also in:]'' {{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/der-ewige-jude/hitler-19390130.shtml |title=Adolf Hitler on the Jewish Question |date=30 January 1939 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314131150/http://holocaust-history.org/der-ewige-jude/hitler-19390130.shtml |archivedate=14 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }} ''[And:]'' {{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/media_fi.php?ModuleId=10005175&amp;MediaId=3108 |title=Hitler Speaks before the Reichstag (German Parliament) |publisher=United States Holocaust Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Raul Hilberg]], in his book ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'', was the first historian to systematically document and analyse the Nazi project to kill every Jew in Europe. The book was initially published in 1961, and issued in an enlarged version in 1985.&lt;ref name =BrowningHil&gt;{{cite web | url= http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&amp;b=395051| title = The Revised Hilberg |last= Browning |first= Christopher |date= 10 May 1987 |accessdate= 2 June 2014 |work= Museumoftolerance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilberg's analysis of the steps that led to the destruction of European Jews revealed that it was "an administrative process carried out by bureaucrats in a network of offices spanning a continent".{{sfnp|Hilberg|1985|p=ix}} Hilberg divides this bureaucracy into four components or hierarchies: the [[Nazi Party]], the civil service, industry, and the [[Wehrmacht]] armed forces – but their cooperation is viewed as "so complete that we may truly speak of their fusion into a machinery of destruction".{{sfnp|Hilberg|1985|p= 56}} For Hilberg, the key stages in the destruction process were: definition and registration of the Jews; expropriation of property; concentration into ghettoes and camps; and, finally, annihilation.{{sfnp|Hilberg|1985|p=354}} Hilberg gives an estimate of 5.1 million as the total number of Jews killed. He breaks this figure down into three categories: Ghettoization and general privation: over 800,000; open-air shootings: over 1,300,000; extermination camps: up to 3,000,000.{{sfnp|Hilberg|1985|p=1219}}

With respect to the "functionalism versus intentionalism" debate about a master plan for the Final Solution, or the lack thereof, Hilberg posits what has been described as "a kind of structural determinism".&lt;ref name=BrowningHil/&gt; Hilberg argues that "a destruction process has an inherent pattern" and the "sequence of steps in a destruction process is thus determined". If a bureaucracy is motivated "to inflict maximum damage upon a group of people", it is "inevitable that a bureaucracy—no matter how decentralized its apparatus or how unplanned its activities—should push its victims through these stages", culminating in their annihilation.{{sfnp|Hilberg|1985|pp= 998–9}}

In his monograph, ''The Origins Of The Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939&amp;nbsp;– March 1942'', [[Christopher Browning]] argues that Nazi policy toward the Jews was radicalized twice: in September 1939, when the [[History of Poland (1939–45)|invasion of Poland]] implied policies of mass expulsion and massive loss of Jewish lives; and in spring 1941, when preparation for [[Operation Barbarossa]] involved the planning of mass execution, mass expulsion, and starvation – to dwarf what had happened in Jewish Poland.{{sfnp|Browning|2004|loc=(2007 ed.: p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=d9Wg4gjtP3cC&amp;q=scale%2Bdwarf#v=snippet&amp;q=scale%2Bdwarf&amp;f=false 213]).}}

Browning believes that the "Final Solution as it is now understood—the systematic attempt to murder every last Jew within the German grasp"&lt;ref name=Browning424&gt;{{harvp|Browning|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=d9Wg4gjtP3cC&amp;lpg=PA424&amp;vq=%22murdering%20every%20last%20Jew%20in%20the%20German%20grasp%22&amp;pg=PA424#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 424]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; took shape during a five-week period, from 18 September to 25 October 1941. During this time: the sites of the first extermination camps were selected, different methods of killing were tested, Jewish emigration from the Third Reich was forbidden, and 11 transports departed for [[Łódź]] as a temporary holding station. During this period, Browning writes, "The vision of the Final Solution had crystallised in the minds of the Nazi leadership, and was being turned into reality."{{r|Browning424}} This period was the peak of Nazi victories against the Soviet Army on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], and, according to Browning, the stunning series of German victories led to both an expectation that the war would soon be won, and the planning of the final destruction of the "[[Jewish Bolshevik#Nazi Germany|Jewish-Bolshevik]] enemy".{{sfnp|Browning|2004|pp= 426–427}}

Browning describes the creation of the extermination camps, which were responsible for the largest number of deaths in the Final Solution, as bringing together three separate developments within the [[Third Reich]]: the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] which had been established in Germany since 1933; an expansion of the gassing technology of the [[Action T4|Nazi euthanasia programme]] to provide killing mechanism of greater efficiency and psychological detachment; and the creation of "factories of death" to be fed endless streams of victims by mass uprooting and deportation that utilized the experience and personnel from earlier population resettlement programmes—especially the [[SS and Police Leader|HSSPF]] and [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s [[RSHA]] for "Jewish affairs and evacuations".{{sfnp|Browning|2004|p= 354}}

[[Peter Longerich]] argues that the search for a finite date on which the Nazis embarked upon the extermination of the Jews is futile, in his book ''Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews'' (2011). Longerich writes: "We should abandon the notion that it is historically meaningful to try to filter the wealth of available historical material and pick out a single decision" that led to the Holocaust.{{sfnp|Longerich|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cxYqYIn73SgC&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;vq=abandon%2Bnotion&amp;pg=PA6#v=snippet&amp;q=abandon+notion&amp;f=false 6]}}&lt;ref name=NYRB&gt;{{cite web |author-link=Timothy Snyder |last=Snyder |first=Timothy |title=A New Approach to the Holocaust |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/jun/23/new-approach-holocaust/ |accessdate=30 March 2015 |work=The New York Review of Books |date=23 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timothy Snyder]] writes that Longerich "grants the significance of [[Arthur Greiser|Greiser's]] murder of Jews by gas at [[Chełmno]] in December 1941", but also detects a significant moment of escalation in spring 1942, which includes "the construction of the large death factory at [[Treblinka]] for the destruction of the Warsaw Jews, and the addition of a gas chamber to the concentration camp at [[Auschwitz]] for the murder of the Jews of Silesia".{{r|NYRB}} Longerich suggests that it "was only in the summer of 1942, that mass killing was finally understood as the realization of the Final Solution, rather than as an extensively violent preliminary to some later program of slave labor and deportation to the lands of a conquered USSR". For Longerich, to see mass killing as the Final Solution was an acknowledgement by the Nazi leadership that there would not be a German military victory over the USSR in the near future.&lt;ref name=NYRB/&gt;

[[David Cesarani]] emphasises the improvised, haphazard nature of Nazi policies in response to changing war time conditions in his overview, ''Final Solution: The Fate Of The European Jews 1933-49'' (2016). "Cesarani provides telling examples", wrote [[Mark Roseman]], "of a lack of coherence and planning for the future in Jewish policy, even when we would most expect it. The classic instance is the invasion of Poland in 1939, when not even the most elementary consideration had been given to what should happen to Poland's Jews either in the shorter or longer term. Given that Poland was home to the largest Jewish population in the world, and that, in a couple of years, it would house the extermination camps, this is remarkable."&lt;ref name="Roseman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/the-last-word/ |title=The last word |last1=Roseman |first1=Mark |date=August 10, 2016 |accessdate=February 13, 2017 |publisher=''The Times Literary Supplement''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas Christopher Browning places the Nazi plan to exterminate the Jews in the context of the Wehrmacht victories on the Eastern front, Cesarani argues that the German subsequent realisation that there would be no swift victory over the Soviet Union "scuppered the last territorial 'solution' still on the table: expulsion to Siberia".&lt;ref name="Waschmann"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/16/final-solution-the-fate-of-the-jews-1933-1949-david-cesarani-review |title=Final Solution by David Cesarani review—the Holocaust on the hoof |authorlink=Nikolaus Wachsmann |last1=Wachsmann |first1=Nikolaus |date=June 16, 2016 |accessdate=February 13, 2017 |publisher=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's declaration of war on the United States on December 11, 1941, "meant that holding European Jews hostage to deter the US from entering the conflict was now pointless. As Joseph Goebbels put it when he summarised a secret speech Hitler made on 12 December 1941: 'The world war is here, the destruction of the Jews must be the inevitable consequence'."&lt;ref name="Waschmann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Adolf Hitler's Declaration of War against the United States|Adolf Hitler's Declaration of War against the United States]] in Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; Cesarani concludes, the Holocaust "was rooted in anti-Semitism, but it was shaped by war".&lt;ref name="Waschmann"/&gt; The fact that the Nazis were, ultimately, so successful in killing between five and six million Jews was not due to the efficiency of the Third Reich or the clarity of their policies. "Rather, the catastrophic rate of killing was due to German persistence … and the duration of the murderous campaigns. This last factor was largely a consequence of allied military failure."{{sfnp|Cesarani|2016|pp=796}}

{{quote|With respect of the Jewish Question, the Führer has decided to make a clean sweep. He prophesied to the Jews that if they again brought about a world war, they would see their annihilation in it. That wasn't just a catch-word. The world war is here and the annihilation of the Jews must be the necessary consequence.&lt;ref name="Donough57"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.holocaust-history.org/hitler-final-solution/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150602232947/http://www.holocaust-history.org/hitler-final-solution/ |archive-date=2 June 2015 |title=When did Hitler decide on the Final Solution? |author=Gord McFee |publisher=Holocaust-history.org |quote=Research in this area is hampered by the fact that no written Hitler-Order launching the Final Solution has ever been found, and that if there ever was one, it most likely was destroyed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cesarani notes that by 1943, as the military position of the German forces deteriorated, the Nazi leadership became more openly explicit about the Final Solution. In March, Goebbels confided to his diary: "On the Jewish question especially, we are in it so deeply that there is no getting out any longer. And that is a good thing. Experience teaches that a movement and a people who have burned their bridges fight with much greater determination and fewer constraints than those that have a chance of retreat."&lt;ref name=Cesarani665&gt;{{harvp|Cesarani|2016|p=665}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Himmler addressed senior SS personnel and leading members of the regime in the [[Posen speeches]] on October 4, 1943, he used "the fate of the Jews as a sort of blood bond to tie the civil and military leadership to the Nazi cause".{{r|Cesarani665}}

{{quote|Today, I am going to refer quite frankly to a very grave chapter. We can mention it now among ourselves quite openly and yet we shall never talk about it in public. I'm referring to the evacuation of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish people. Most of you will know what it's like to see 100 corpses side by side or 500 corpses or 1,000 of them. To have coped with this and—except for cases of human weakness—to have remained decent, that has made us tough. This is an unwritten—never to be written—and yet glorious page in our history.{{r|Cesarani665}}}}

In May 1944, Himmler told senior army officers that, "The Jewish question has been solved in Germany and in the countries occupied by Germany. It has been solved uncompromisingly, as was appropriate in view of the struggle in which we were engaged for the life of our nation." Himmler explained that it was important that even women and children had to die, so that no "hate-filled avengers" would be able to confront our children and grandchildren.{{sfnp|Cesarani|2016|pp=666}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5704">In [[linguistics]] and especially [[phonology]], '''functional load''', or '''phonemic load''', refers to the importance of certain features in making distinctions in a language. In other words, a high functional load will make it hard to guess the identity of a phoneme that is not perceived in a word because of noise or omission.

==Overview==

The term "functional load" goes back to the days of the [[Prague School]]; references to it can be found in the work of [[Vilem Mathesius]] in 1929. Its most vocal advocate was [[André Martinet]], a historical linguist who claimed it was a factor in the likelihood of a phonological merger.
&lt;ref&gt;Économie des changements phonétiques: Traité de phonologie diachronique. Par ANDRÉ MARTINET. (Bibliotheca romanica, Series prima: Manualia et cornrnentationes, No. 10.) Pp. 396. Berne: editions A. Francke S. A., 1955&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first suggested measurement for functional load was the number of minimal pairs, but this does not take into account word frequency and is difficult to generalize beyond binary phonemic oppositions. Charles Hockett proposed an [[information theory|information theoretic]] definition in 1955
,&lt;ref&gt;A manual of phonology. By CHARLES F. HOCKETT(''International journal of American linguistics'', Vol. 21, No. 4, Part 1 October 1955 = Indiana University publications in anthropology and linguistics, Memoir 11 of IJAL.) Pp. v, 246. Baltimore: Waverly Press (for Indiana University, under the auspices of [the] Linguistic Society of America [and the] American Anthropological Association), 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; which has since been generalized.&lt;ref name=surniy&gt;Surendran and Niyogi, [http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~dinoj/fload_bookchapter.pdf Quantifying the functional load of phonemic oppositions, distinctive features, and suprasegmentals], chapter in ''Current trends in the theory of linguistic change. In commemoration of Eugenio Coseriu (1921-2002)'', Ole Nedergaard Thomsen (editor), Amsterdam &amp; Philadelphia: Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; Now, given a large [[text corpus]], one can compute the functional load of any phonological contrast including [[distinctive feature]]s, [[suprasegmental]]s,  and distinctions between groups of [[phoneme]]s. For instance, the functional load of tones in [[Standard Chinese]] is as high as that of vowels i.e. the information lost when all tones sound alike is as much as that lost when all vowels sound alike.&lt;ref&gt;Surendran and Levow, [http://www.isca-speech.org/archive_open/sp2004/sp04_099.pdf ''The functional load of tone in Mandarin is as high as that of vowels''], Proceedings of Speech Prosody 2004, Nara, Japan, pp. 99-102.&lt;/ref&gt;  
               
Martinet predicted that perceptually similar pairs of phonemes with low functional load would merge. This has not been proved empirically; indeed, all empirical tests have come out against it e.g. {{IPA|/n/}} merged with {{IPA|/l/}} in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] in word-initial position in the late 20th century despite the fact that of all consonants in binary opposition to {{IPA|/n/}}, only the {{IPA|/n/-/m/}} opposition had a higher functional load than the {{IPA|/n/-/l/}} opposition.&lt;ref name="surniy"/&gt;

==Examples==
===English===
{{original research|section|date=July 2017}}

English [[vowel]]s, for example, have a very high functional load. There are innumerable sets of words [[minimal pair|distinguished just]] by their vowels, such as ''pin, pen, pan, pun, pain, pine''. [[Voice (phonetics)|Voicing]] is similar, as can be seen in ''pat - bad, sue - zoo''. Speakers who do not control these differences make it very difficult for others to understand them. 

However, although voicing is generally important in English, the voicing difference between the two fricatives written ⟨th⟩, {{IPA|/θ, ð/}}, has a very low functional load: it is difficult to find meaningful distinctions dependent solely on this difference. One of the few examples is ''thigh'' vs. ''thy'' although the two can be distinguished from context alone. Similar is the difference of {{IPA|/dʒ/}} (written ⟨j⟩, ⟨ge⟩, etc.) versus {{IPA|/ʒ/}} ([[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-coalescence|resulting from]] {{IPA|/z + j/}}, or the ⟨j⟩, ⟨ge⟩, etc. in some recent [[French language|French]] loanwords), as in ''virgin'' vs. ''version''. The difference between the two ⟨ng⟩ sounds, {{IPA|[ŋ, ŋɡ]}}, found in ''singer'' and ''finger'', is so unimportant that it makes no practical difference if one mixes them up, and some dialects pronounce the sounds the same in both words. The functional load is nearly zero—not surprising since the phoneme {{IPA|/ŋ/}} originated as a [[Phonological history of English consonants#Ng coalescence|coalescence of {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}}]] when word-final.

An ongoing example would be the merger of the AIR and EAR vowels in [[New Zealand English]]. The phonetic similarity between words like ''here'' and ''hare'' does not seem to hamper oral communication in any major way as long as the context is provided. Therefore, those vowels have low functional load in New Zealand English despite their high frequency of occurrences in that dialect.

===Mandarin===
Another example is the functional load of [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] in [[Mandarin Chinese]], which is nearly as high as that of their vowels.{{cn|date=December 2015}} This means that the loss of information when all tones sound alike in Mandarin is approximately equal to that when all vowels sound alike in the language.  By contrast, in many Bantu languages, the tones have a low functional load, and in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] tones disappeared altogether.

'''GoldenDict''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[dictionary]] program that gives translations of words and phrases for different languages. It allows the use of several popular dictionary file formats simultaneously and without conversion.

The project aims to create a feature-rich dictionary search program.

== Features ==

* The desktop program is free and open-source software ([[FOSS]]).
* Supports multiple electronic dictionary file formats,&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldendict.org/wiki/index.php/Supported_dictionary_formats File formats supported by GoldenDict]&lt;/ref&gt; namely:
** [[WordNet]] – a free lexical database for the English language
** [[XDXF]] dictionary (XML Dictionary eXchange Format)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://github.com/goldendict/goldendict | title=goldendict on github.com | accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Babylon (program)|Babylon]] (.bgl) files with images and resources
** [[StarDict]] (.ifo / .dict / .idx / .syn) dictionaries
** [[DICT|Dictd]] (.index / .dict / .dz) dictionary files
** ABBYY Lingvo (.dsl) source files, together with abbreviation files. The files can be optionally compressed with [[DICT#dictzip|dictzip]]. Dictionary resources can be packed together into a .zip file
** ABBYY Lingvo (.lsa / .dat) audio archives. Those can be indexed separately or referred to from .dsl files
** [[Sdictionary]] (.dct) dictionaries. This format is also known as sdict.
** [[Aard]] (.aar) dictionaries
** Sound packs (.zips) in zip archives
** [[MDict]] (.mdx / .mdd) dictionaries
** [[EPWING]] (.Catalogs) dictionaries
* Uses [[WebKit]] layout engine for a more accurate article representation (including formatting, colors, images and links)
* Supports lookups in Wikipedia, Wiktionary, or any other [[MediaWiki]]-based sites
* Can use arbitrary websites as dictionaries via templated [[URL]] patterns
* Can translate long text of many languages (e.g. through [[Yahoo! Babel Fish|Babelfish]], by adding this line in GoldenDict: http://fr.babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_txt?trtext=%GDWORD%&amp;lp=fr_en for translating from French to English)
* Hunspell-based morphology system, used for word stemming and [[spelling suggestion]]s
* Can index arbitrary directories with audio files for pronunciation lookups
* Can feed look up word to external program and print program output along other dictionary results
* Full [[Unicode]] case, diacritics, punctuation and whitespace folding. This means the ability to type in words without any accents, correct case, punctuation or spaces (e.g. typing "Grussen" would yield "grüßen" in German dictionaries)
* Supports Russian, Greek, German, Belarusian and Japanese [[transliteration]]
* Native [[Text-To-Speech|TTS]] support in Windows and macOS
* Scan popup functionality. A small popup window displays the translation of a word chosen from another application
* Support for global hotkeys (to activate the program window or translate a word from the clipboard)
* Tabbed browsing in a [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt 4]] interface
* Supports [[NPAPI]] web plugins (e.g. [[Flash Player]])
* Supports dictionary custom icons
* Cross-platform: Linux/X11, macOS, Maemo, Android and Windows + portable to others (Android application is closed-source and is available in [[Google Play]] as both paid and free version (which displays advertisements and is limited to 5 dictionaries))
* Allows playback of pronunciation sound clips in different languages using [[Forvo]] online service

== Advantages and shortcomings ==

Compared to other similar software GoldenDict:

* Supports several popular dictionary file formats, whereas [[Babylon (software)|Babylon]] and ABBYY Lingvo dictionary software support only one (native) format, and [[Stardict]] supports only two formats.
* The program's internal use of the WebKit layout engine allows displaying articles in a format similar to web pages in a [[web browser]], which ABBYY Lingvo, StarDict and Babylon are unable to do.
* The current version (1.0.1) cannot perform full-text searches inside articles of a dictionary. However, finding text in the currently displayed article is possible.
* The Android version of GoldenDict is not open-source.
*  GoldenDict lacks important features of Japanese dictionary programs. For example, it doesn't provide search by radicals for Japanese. Unlike specialised programs like [https://www.tagaini.net/ Tagaini Jisho]

{{more citations needed|date=November 2010}}
'''''Good ol' boy''''' or '''''good old boy''''' is an [[American English]] [[slang]] term that can have both positive and negative meanings, depending on context and use.&lt;ref name=Am&gt;{{cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=4th |year=2009 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | location=Boston | isbn=0-618-70172-9 | page=757 | oclc=535837910 | quote=n. Slang: A man having qualities held to be characteristic of certain Southern white males, such as a relaxed or informal manner, strong loyalty to family and friends, and often an anti-intellectual bias and intolerant point of view.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonplace in the [[Southern United States]].

== In the United States ==
=== Positive aspects ===
The term can be used for well socialized men who live in [[rural]] and generally [[American South|Southern]] areas. If a man is humble and well thought of, he can be referred to as a good old boy, regardless of his age.

It is also commonly applied to white men from a family with multi-generational wealth or [[Reputation|prestige]] established by a legacy of [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] and [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] ownership, or to men who behave like a [[Southern gentleman]].

=== Negative aspects ===
Pejoratively, the phrase can often suggest a man with an [[anti-intellectual]] or [[Racism in the United States|racist]] bias or some other intolerant viewpoint.&lt;ref name=Am /&gt;

The phrase also can refer negatively to someone who engages in [[cronyism]] among men who have known each other for a long period of time. Collectively, these people are referred to as a good ol' boy network, or an old boys' club.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10930">'''Henry Spelman''' (1595&amp;ndash;1623) was an [[English people|English]] adventurer, soldier, and author, the son of Erasmus Spelman and nephew to Sir [[Henry Spelman]] of [[Congham]] (1562&amp;ndash;1641).  The younger Henry Spelman was born in 1595, and left his home in [[Norfolk, England]] at age 14 to sail to [[Virginia Colony]] aboard the ship "Unity", as a part of the [[Third Supply]] to the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Colony]] in 1609.  He is remembered for writing the ''Relation of Virginia'', documenting the first permanent English settlement in North America at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], and particularly the lifestyles of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]] led by [[Chief Powhatan]].

==The 1609 voyage==
Despite being a son of the high sheriff of his county, Spelman, owing to the traditional English practice of [[primogeniture]], was left to indenture himself as a laborer to pay his passage to the New World. The Third Supply flotilla of 9 ships set sail from [[Plymouth, England]] on 2 June 1609.  In July 1609,&lt;ref&gt;A True Declaration of the estate of the Colonie in Virginia ..., by the Council for Virginia, 1610.&lt;/ref&gt; the ships ran into a massive 3 day storm and the fleet was broken up, with the flagship [[Sea Venture]] wrecking upon the islands of [[Bermuda]].  After the storm passed, the remaining ships reassembled off of [[Cape Henry]] and sailed up the coast, arriving at Jamestown 4 or 5 days later in October 1609.&lt;ref name="Spelman, Relation of Virginia"&gt;Spelman, "Relation of Virginia"&lt;/ref&gt;

==A son of Powhatan==
Only two weeks after his arrival at the Jamestown Settlement, Henry went with Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] on an expedition up the James River to the Indian town called [[Powhatan]].  (located in the East End portion of the modern-day city of [[Richmond, Virginia]].) Smith knew that Jamestown would be unable to support the arrival of several hundred new colonists through the coming winter, and he traded young Henry's bonded servitude in exchange for the village, which was ruled by ''[[weroance]]'' Parahunt, son of Wahunsunacock (also known as [[Chief Powhatan]].)  The agreement was also for the boy to apprentice the native [[Powhatan language]], and thus become an interpreter and serve as a messenger between the two cultures.  Young Henry Spelman was not the first boy to be traded to the Powhatans; Thomas Savage had previously been given to Powhatan by Captain [[Christopher Newport]] in 1608, and Henry named in his writings of "Dutchman Samuel" (actually "Samuel Collier" who was John Smith's page) as another European child that lived with the Natives.&lt;ref name="Spelman, Relation of Virginia"/&gt;

Parahunt treated Henry well, but relations soured between the English and the Powhatan, eventually leading to warfare.  Henry wanted to return to the English and soon made his way back to Jamestown.  His stay was brief however due to the shortage of food at the fort as they started into what has been named the [[Starving Time (Jamestown)|starving time]]; and he knew the Indians had food in their village.  Henry took a hatchet and some copper with him and gave it to Powhatan.  Powhatan was pleased and treated Henry kindly for a while.&lt;ref name="Spelman, Relation of Virginia"/&gt;

Henry spent a total of about a year and a half with the Powhatan Indians, learning the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language and their way of life. He acted as a messenger and interpreter between the Powhatan people and the English, arranging for the two groups to trade with one another.  He also witnessed hostilities between them which made him feel uneasy. He had been living at Yawtanoone (Youghtanund) for six months when a local chief of the [[Patawomeck]], a tribe living on the south side of the Potomac River, came to visit Powhatan.&lt;ref&gt;Conway Whittle Sams, 1916, ''The conquest of Virginia: the forest primeval'', xi,xii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Without telling [[Chief Powhatan]], Henry, Thomas and Dutchman Samuel left when the visiting Chief left.  Powhatan's men captured and killed Samuel.&lt;ref name="Spelman, Relation of Virginia"/&gt;  In his book "Generall Historie of Virginia, …", Capt. John Smith wrote that '' "[[Pocahontas|Pokahontas]] the Kings daughter saved a boy called Henry Spilman that lived many yeeres after, by her meanes, amongst the [[Patawomeck|Patawomekes]]." '' &lt;ref&gt;Smith, "Generall Historie", p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;  There he stayed at Paspatanzie, moved freely and was treated as a special guest.

==The Abduction of Pocahontas==
In September 1610, Captain [[Samuel Argall]] was on a trading mission and found Henry living with the [[Patawomeck]], and he was bought back for "sum copper." With his knowledge of the native language and culture, Henry continued to help the English trade copper for valuable supplies such as corn. He also helped the Colonists form an alliance with these northern Native Americans that would be important for the future of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]].  In 1613, Henry was the interpreter when Chief Japazaws helped Argall abduct [[Pocahontas]], which eventually led to her marriage to [[John Rolfe]] and a temporary peace with Powhatan.  Henry continued to work as an interpreter for the English, mixing with both English and Powhatan leaders.

==Captain of Militia==
Henry went back to England in 1613, and made several other trips, but returned to Virginia each time to continue to serve as an interpreter, and eventually rising to the rank of Captain.  During this time he married an Patawomeck Indian woman who is believed to have been given the English name "Martha Fox."  (''According to traditions passed on to Henry Spellman's descendents, - his native wife was a sister of Pocahontas, and daughter of Powhatan''.) In 1619, a rival interpreter accused Henry of speaking badly about the now Governor Samuel Argall to [[Opchanacanough]], who was the new chief of the Powhatan people.  If he was found guilty of treason, Henry could have been executed, but he was instead found guilty of a lesser crime, and on 4 August 1619, he lost his rank of Captain and was sentenced to serve the Governor for seven years as an interpreter.  Records state: '' "this sentence being read to Spelman he, as one that had in him more of the Savage than of the Christian, muttered certain words to himself neither showing any remorse for his offences, nor yet any thankfulness to the Assembly for their so favorable censure." '' &lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Virginia Assembly, 1619&lt;/ref&gt;

==The War of Opchanacanough==
In 1622 [[Opchanacanough]] tried to drive the English out of [[Virginia]] by attacking the settlers,  killing about 330 men, women and children. Henry survived the attacks and was called upon to renew the English alliance with the [[Patawomeck]] tribe, who were at that point detached from Powhatan's Confederacy.  In the spring of 1623, Henry volunteered to take a group of 19 men north to the Potomac River, away from the fighting near Jamestown, to barter for corn or other food.  On 23 March 1623 the party was attacked by 60 canoes full of Anacostan [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] from their settlement of [[Nacochtank]] along the [[Anacostia River]].  Henry Spelman and all others in his party were killed or captured in the botched trading expedition (apart from Captain Henry Fleet, who spent 5 years in captivity with them and also learned their language).  After providing much good service as an interpreter, Henry Spelman died as he had lived – amongst the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Indians]] at 28 years old.  Some sources say Spelman was captured and beheaded by the Anacostans.  This attack was in reprisal for a 1622 attack by Fleet and the Patawomecks in which 18 Anacostans had been killed.

He was survived by his [[Patawomeck]] spouse "Martha Fox," a child named Clement Spelman, his uncle Sir [[Henry Spelman]], his brothers Thomas Spelman of [[Kecoughtan, Virginia]] and Francis Spelman of [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Virginia Historical Society, Contributor Philip Alexander Bruce, William Glover Stanard, Published 1893, Virginia Historical Society" p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation of Virginia==
Henry Spelman's handwritten manuscript, ''a Relation of Virginia'' was later printed privately in 1872 by the Chiswick Press of [[London]].

'''Jakov of Serres''' ({{lang-sr|Јаков Серски}}; 1300–1365) was a medieval Serbian writer, scholar, translator, and hierarch of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], one of the most important men of letters working in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;John Van Antwerp Fine -''The late medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the late twelfth...''  1987 – Page 439 "The likelihood of this identification is enhanced by the fact that Jacob of Serres sent several books to the Monastery of Mount Sinai in 1360. Ties between Serbia and Sinai had long existed. Milutin had financed the building on Sinai of a church ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/TourPopup.asp?TourID=262|publisher=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Evidence about his life is scarce but his literary legacy suggests an excellent knowledge of Greek and Slavic languages. In 1343, King and eventually Emperor, [[Stefan Dušan]] began to build the [[Monastery of the Holy Archangels]] near [[Prizren]]; and he appointed Jakov, a learned and highly esteemed monk, its first ''[[hegumen]]'' (abbot). Both Stefan Dušan and his wife Jelena were in awe of Jakov's wide knowledge and they often sought his company and counsel. In 1345, Stefan Dušan captured the city of [[Serres]] from the Byzantine Empire; and Jakov was appointed Metropolitan of Serres and its surrounding territories. The population of Serres was mixed Slavic, Albanian and Greek and Jakov was fluent in all three languages and their dialects. In fact, Jakov wrote some literature hymns in Greek, and is numbered among the Greek authors as well as Serbian. Jakov was a disciple of [[Gregory of Sinai]] and a friend of [[Romylos of Ravanica]].

After the sudden death of Stefan Dušan in 1355, Jelena, Dušan's wife, became a nun, took the name Jelisaveta, and moved from Skoplje, the capital of Serbia, to Serres. From there, she administered her estates; and Jakov was at her side as wise counsel. Jakov wrote the ''[[Triodion]]'' which he sent as his bequest to the Monastery of the Theotokos in Sinai in 1359 or 1360. At present, the Triodion (a two-part Triodion, one for Lent and the other for the period between Easter and Pentecost) is kept in Monastery of St. Catherine in Sinai. Copies are also kept at [[Hilandar Monastery]], Mount Athos, Greece, and in libraries in the United Kingdom, Europe and North America.

He is illustrated in the Serbian manuscript of [[Kalist]]'s ''[[Tetraevangelion]]'' ([[Canonical gospels|The Four Gospels]]) dating to 1354, held at the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Orientalia christiana periodica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRfZAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Pont. institutum orientalium studiorum|quote=An illumination in a 14th century Serbian MS, the Slavonic Tetraevange- lion of codex British Museum Add. 39626 (A.

A '''knee wall''' is a short [[wall]], typically under three feet (one metre) in height, used to support the [[rafter]]s in timber roof construction. In his book ''A Visual Dictionary of Architecture'', [[Frank Ching|Francis D. K. Ching]] defines a knee wall as "a short wall supporting rafters at some intermediate position along their length."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ching |first= Francis D. K. |title= A Visual Dictionary of Architecture |publisher= Van Nostrand Reinhold |location= New York |year= 1995 |isbn= 0-442-00904-6 |page= 211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The knee wall provides support to rafters which therefore need not be large enough to span from the [[ridge]] to the [[eaves]]. Typically the knee wall is covered with plaster or gypsum board, enclosing the useful part of the attic space (not necessarily high enough for a person to stand up), while the remaining small space under the eaves is only useful for storage.

The term is derived from the association with the vertical location of the human knee. Knee walls are common in old houses in which the ceiling on the top floor is an [[attic]], i.e. the ceiling is the underside of the roof and slopes down on one or more sides.

About half of the homepages of the most visited sites on the Internet are in [[English language|English]], with varying amounts of information available in many other [[language]]s.&lt;ref name="UofCLBWApril2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="12years"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/publications-and-communication-materials/publications/full-list/twelve-years-of-measuring-linguistic-diversity-in-the-internet-balance-and-perspectives/ | title=Twelve years of measuring linguistic diversity in the Internet: balance and perspectives | author=Pimienta, Daniel, Prado, Daniel and Blanco, Álvaro | journal=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other top languages, according to W3Techs, are [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref name="UofCLBWApril2013" /&gt;

Of the more than 7,000 existing languages, only a few hundred are recognized as being in use for content pages on the Internet.&lt;ref name="towards"&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/statistics ''The World Languages Statistics'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UofCLBWApril2013"/&gt;

==Languages used==
There is debate over the most-used languages on the Internet. A 2009 UNESCO report monitoring the languages of websites for 12 years, from 1996 to 2008, found a steady year-on-year decline in the percentage of webpages in English, from 75 percent in 1998 to 45 percent in 2005.&lt;ref name="12years" /&gt; The authors found that English remained at 45 percent of content for 2005 to the end of the study but believe this was due to the bias of search engines indexing more English-language content rather than a true stabilization of the percentage of content in English online.&lt;ref name="12years"/&gt;

Ongoing monitoring by W3Techs showed that in March 2015, just over 55 percent of the most visited websites had English-language homepages.&lt;ref name="UofCLBWApril2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Usage of content languages for websites|url=http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_language/all|work=W3Techs.com|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other top languages that are used at least in 2 percent of the one million most visited websites according to W3Techs are [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name="UofCLBWApril2013" /&gt;

The figures from the W3Techs study are based on the one million most visited websites (i.e., approximately 0.27 percent of all websites according to December 2011 figures) as ranked by [[Alexa Internet|Alexa.com]], and language is identified using only the home page of the sites in most cases (i.e., all of Wikipedia is based on the language detection of http://www.wikipedia.org).&lt;ref name="W3TechsDetails"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://w3techs.com/technologies | title=Technologies Overview | publisher=W3Techs | accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the figures show a significantly higher percentage for many languages (especially for English) as compared to the figures for all websites.&lt;ref name="Alternative"&gt;[http://funredes.org/lc2017/ ''An alternative approach to produce indicators of languages in the Internet''] Pimienta, Daniel, June 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; The figures for all websites are unknown, but some sources estimate below 50 percent for English; see for instance, Towards a multilingual cyberspace &lt;ref&gt;[http://net-lang.net/lang_en NET.LANG: Towards a multilingual cyberspace] MAAYA (coord.), Laurent Vannini and Hervé le Crosnier (eds.), Maaya Network, C&amp;F éditions, March 2012, 446 pp., {{ISBN|978-2-915825-08-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2009 UNESCO report.&lt;ref name="12years" /&gt;

The number of non-English pages is rapidly expanding. The use of English online increased by around 281 percent from 2001 to 2011, a lower rate of growth than that of Spanish (743 percent), Chinese (1,277 percent), Russian (1,826 percent) or Arabic (2,501 percent) over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rotaru|first=Alexandru|url=http://www.scottmclay.co.uk/foreign-language-internet-good-business/|title=The foreign language Internet is good for business |accessdate=21 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407032518/http://www.scottmclay.co.uk/foreign-language-internet-good-business|archivedate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2000 study, the international auxiliary language [[Esperanto]] ranked 40 out of all languages in search engine queries, also ranking 27 out of all languages that rely on the [[Latin script]].&lt;ref&gt;Grefenstette, Gregory; Nioche, Julien.

[[File:Late harvest Semillon.jpg|right|thumb|A late harvest Semillon from Washington State.]]
'''Late harvest wine''' is wine made from [[grape]]s left on the [[vine]] longer than usual. ''Late harvest'' is usually an indication of a sweet [[dessert wine]], such as late harvest [[Riesling]]. Late harvest grapes are often more similar to [[raisins]], but have been naturally dehydrated while on the vine.

[[Botrytis cinerea]], or ''[[noble rot]]'', is a mold that causes grapes to lose nearly all of their water content. Wines made from botrytis-affected grapes are generally very sweet.

== Noble rot ==
[[File:Botrytis riesling.jpg|right|thumb|Botrytis affected grapes]]
{{Main|Noble rot}}
Botrytis cinerea is a [[fungus]] that affects many wine grapes and causes them to shrivel into moldy raisins. The fungus responds to the humidity and warmth in the climate and attacks the grapes. As the mold penetrates the skin its spores begin to [[germinate]], causing the water inside to evaporate and the grape to dehydrate. With the absence of water, the [[Sugars in wine|sugar]] becomes more concentrated and the botrytis begins to alter the acidity within the grape. Typically botrytis infection begins to take place in late September and can last till late October. In some years [[desiccation]] may occur leaving tiny amount of sweet liquor like juice within the grape.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 137"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 137 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The infection rate of botrytis is sporadic with vines and bunches achieving full rottenness at different times. This requires [[harvest (wine)|harvest]] workers to go through the vineyards several times between October and November to hand-pick the full rotted grapes. In some occasions, the usable grapes from a single vine may only produce enough juice for a single glass.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 138"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 138 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sauternes ===
{{Main|Sauternes (wine)}}
[[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]], such as [[Château d'Yquem]], are produced in the [[Graves#Sauternes AOC and Barsac AOC|Sauternes]] region (including [[Barsac, Gironde|Barsac]]) south of [[Bordeaux]]. They are made from botrytis infected [[Semillon]] and [[Sauvignon blanc]] grapes. Semillon is preferred due to the grape's thin skin and susceptibility to the botrytis which gives the grape a high [[sugar]] content. These wines are noted for the balance that complements the honeyed sweetness.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 137" /&gt;

During [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]], the juice is transferred into [[oak (wine)|oak]] [[wine barrel]]s where the high sugar concentration of [[must]] prolongs the fermentation time which can last up to a year. When the [[alcohol]] level kills off all present [[yeast (wine)|yeast]], the fermentation stops leaving the [[residual sugar]] at levels between 8 and 12% and alcohol levels around 14%.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 138" /&gt;

After fermentation, the wine is placed in an [[aging barrel]] for two to three years before it is bottled where it will continue aging. A Sauterne from a reputable estate can [[bottle age]] for over 30 years though they normally hit their peak 10 years after the [[vintage]] date.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 139"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 139 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tokaji/Tokaj/Tokajské ===
{{Main|Tokaji}}
[[File:Tokaj cellar2.png|right|thumb|Tokaji wine cellars]]
Tokaji wines are produced in the [[Tokaj]] regions of [[Hungary]] and [[Slovakia]]. Wine has been made in these regions since as early as 1650, before the botrytized wines of Sauternes and the [[Rheingau]] were produced. The [[Furmint]], Yellow [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat]], and [[Hárslevelű]]/[[Lipovina]] grapes are the primary grapes used in this wine. In a manner similar to [[Sherry]], the wine is aged in partially filled barrels with a film of yeast on top and stored underground in [[Wine cellar|wine cavern]]s.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 273-274"&gt;J. Robinson ''Jancis Robinson's Wine Course'' pg 273-274 Abbeville Press Publisher 2003 {{ISBN|0-7892-0883-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== German late harvest wines ==
{{Main|German wine}}
In [[Germany]], wines are [[German wine classification|classified]] according to the [[ripeness of the grape]] at time of harvest. Within the [[Qualitätswein mit Prädikat]] classification, there are four levels of late harvest wines, roughly ranging from dry to very sweet: [[Spätlese]] ("late harvest"), [[Auslese]] ("selected harvest"), [[Beerenauslese]] ("selected berries harvest") and [[Trockenbeerenauslese]] ("selected dried-berries harvest") with the last two levels being botrytized.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 522-523"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 522-523 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Icewine ==
{{Main|Ice wine}}
[[File:Ice wine grapes.jpg|right|thumb|Grapes frozen on the vine]]
Ice wines are popular in the cold northernly wine regions of Germany and [[Canada]] where the grapes can freeze on the vine. As the grapes are [[pressed (wine)|pressed]], the frozen water crystals are eliminated leaving the highly concentrated sugar behind.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 89"&gt;J. Robinson ''Jancis Robinson's Wine Course'' pg 89 Abbeville Press Publisher 2003 {{ISBN|0-7892-0883-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Raisin wine ==
{{Main|Raisin wine}}
Raisin wines are sometimes made from grapes that have been left on the vine in the sun to concentrate their sugar.

The '''Left May''' or '''Arai''' languages are a small [[language family]] of half a dozen closely related but not mutually intelligible languages in the centre of [[New Guinea]], along the left bank of the [[May River (New Guinea)|May River]]. There are only about 2,000 speakers in all.

The languages are:
:[[Iteri language|Iteri]] (Rocky Peak), [[Nakwi language|Nakwi]], [[Ama language (New Guinea)|Ama]], [[Nimo language|Nimo]], [[Owiniga language|Owiniga]], and (possibly) [[Bo language (New Guinea)|Bo]].

[[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] (2005) linked the Left May languages to Laycock's [[Kwomtari–Baibai languages]] in a [[Left May – Kwomtari languages|Left May – Kwomtari]] family, based on similarities in the [[pronoun]]s of Rocky Peak. However, he had not corrected for Laycock's errors in classification, and it is not clear if the links are with the [[Kwomtari languages|Kwomtari]] or [[Fas languages|Fas]] languages.

Timothy Usher links the Left May languages to their neighbors, the [[Amto–Musan languages]] and the [[Pyu language (Papua New Guinea)|Pyu language]] in as [[Arai–Samaia languages|Arai–Samaia]] stock.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/arai-and-samaia-rivers NewGuineaWorld, Arai and Samaia Rivers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===

====Monophthongs====
Makalero has five vowel phonemes. Most long vowels occur in predictable contexts; thus Huber argues long vowels are marginal phonemes at best.

Syllables are commonly CV; some are CVC. Epenthetic vowels are often inserted between series of two consonants, and echo vowels are often added to the end of phonological phrases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2479">In law enforcement parlance, the term '''murder book''' refers to the case file of a [[murder]] investigation. Typically, murder books include [[Forensic photography|crime scene photographs]] and sketches, [[autopsy]] and [[forensic]] reports, transcripts of investigators' notes and witness interviews. The murder book encapsulates the complete [[paper trail]] of a murder investigation, from the time the murder is first reported through the arrest of a [[suspect]].

Law enforcement agencies typically guard murder books carefully, and it is unusual for civilians to be given unfettered access to these kinds of records, especially for unsolved cases.

==Murder book in modern culture==

===In films and television===
*In the [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel ''[[The Murder Book]]'' (2002) by [[Jonathan Kellerman]], a murder book is sent to the psychologist [[Alex Delaware]], renewing the hunt for a murderer in a twenty-year-old case.
*A murder book featured heavily in the plot of the [[2006 in television|2006/2008]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] miniseries ''[[Day Break]]''.
*Episode 387-1716 of the TV series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' is titled "[[List of Law &amp; Order episodes#Season 17: 2006–2007|Murder Book]]" (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/law-and-order/murder-book/episode/967364/summary.html |title=Law &amp; Order: Murder Book |publisher=TV.com |date=2007-03-16 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Murder Book'' (2014–) is an American television series on the [[Investigation Discovery]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.investigationdiscovery.com/tv-shows/murder-book/ | title = Murder Book: Thursday 10/9C | publisher = Investigation Discovery | accessdate = December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|3903826|Murder Book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literature and publications===
American crime novelist [[Michael Connelly]] makes regular references to the meticulous murder books kept by [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective [[Harry Bosch]], particularly in ''[[The Black Echo]]'', ''[[The Concrete Blonde]]'', ''[[The Last Coyote]]'', ''[[Trunk Music (novel)|Trunk Music]]'', ''[[The Closers]]'', and ''[[The Drop (novel)|The Drop]]''.

'''''Northeastern Neo-Aramaic''''' (often abbreviated '''''NENA''''') is a term used by [[Semitic studies|Semiticist]]s to refer to a large variety of [[Modern Aramaic language]]s that were once spoken in a large region stretching from the plain of [[Urmia]], in northwestern [[Iran]], to the plain of [[Mosul]], in northern [[Iraq]], as well as bordering regions in south east [[Turkey]] and north east [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Isabella, ''Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, including a summer in the Upper Karun region and a visit to the Nestorian rayahs'', London: J. Murray, 1891, vol. ii, pp. 282 and 306&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 1990s, the NENA group had an estimated number of fluent speakers among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] just below 500,000, spread throughout the Middle East and the [[Assyrian diaspora]]. More than 90% of these speak either the [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] or the [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] variety, two varieties of Christian Neo-Aramaic  or ''Sureth'' which, contrary to what their names suggest, are not divided among denominational [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]/[[Assyrian Church of the East]] lines, and indeed some speakers of both dialects may be followers of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] or [[Protestants]]. There are a number of other NENA varieties, but all of them are endangered or near-extinct, and in addition, some Assyrian communities speak [[Central Neo-Aramaic]] dialects such as [[Turoyo]].&lt;ref&gt;The Nestorians and their Rituals; George Percy Badger.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Short History of Syriac Christianity; W. Stewart McCullough.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
The NENA languages contain a large number of loanwords and some grammatical features from the extinct [[East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language]] of [[Mesopotamia]] (the original language of the Assyrians) and also in more modern times from their surrounding languages: [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Turkish language]]. These languages are spoken by both Jews and Christian Assyrians from the area. Each variety of NENA is clearly Jewish or Assyrian.

However, not all varieties of one or other religious groups are intelligible with all others of the group. Likewise, in some places Jews and Assyrian Christians from the same locale speak mutually unintelligible varieties of Aramaic, where in other places their language is quite similar. The differences can be explained by the fact that NENA communities gradually became isolated into small groups spread over a wide area, and some had to be highly mobile due to various ethnic and religious persecutions.

The influence of classical Aramaic varieties — [[Syriac language|Syriac]] on Christian varieties and [[Targum]]ic on Jewish communities — gives a dual heritage that further distinguishes language by faith. Many of the Jewish speakers of NENA varieties, the [[Kurdish Jews]], now live in [[Israel]], where Neo-Aramaic is [[endangered language|endangered]] by the dominance of [[Hebrew language|Modern Hebrew]]. Many Christian NENA speakers, who usually are [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], are in [[diaspora]] in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]], the [[Caucasus]] and elsewhere, although indigenous communities remain in northern [[Iraq]], south east [[Turkey]], north east [[Syria]] and north west [[Iran]], an area roughly comprising what had been ancient [[Assyria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfhart Heinrichs|Heinrichs, Wolfhart]] (ed.) (1990). ''Studies in Neo-Aramaic''. Scholars Press: Atlanta, Georgia. {{ISBN|1-55540-430-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grouping==
Blench (2006) considers Eastern Neo-Aramaic, including [[Neo-Mandaic]], to be a single language, contrasting with [[Central Neo-Aramaic|Central]] (Turoyo) and [[Western Neo-Aramaic]].&lt;ref&gt;Blench, 2006. [http://rogerblench.info/Language/Afroasiatic/General/AALIST.pdf The Afro-Asiatic Languages: Classification and Reference List]&lt;/ref&gt; [[SIL Ethnologue]] assigns ISO codes to twelve NENA varieties, two of them extinct:
* Neo-Syriac [syr] (''Sooreth, Suret, Soorath, Soorith, Suras, Sureth''), historically derived from the dialect of the [[Lake Urmia]] region, now mostly spoken in [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] and [[Iraqi Kurdistan|northern Iraq]].

A '''PSTN network topology''' is the switching [[network topology]] of a telephone network connected to the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).

In the United States and Canada, the '''Bell System network topology''' was the switching system hierarchy implemented and operated from the late 1940s to the 1980s for the purpose of integrating the diverse array of local telephone companies and telephone numbering plans to achieve nationwide  [[Direct Distance Dialing]] (DDD) by telephone subscribers. It was the precursor of the world-wide interconnected [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).

The ideas originated in the [[Bell System]] in the [[United States]], but were soon adopted by other countries where [[telephone company|telephone operator]]s were facing similar issues, even when service smaller geographic areas. The system in the United Kingdom implemented by the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]] resulted in fewer switching levels than the Bell System.

==Bell System==
[[Image:PSTN office classification hierarchy.svg|thumbnail|300px|AT&amp;T PSTN central office classification hierarchy]]
In the late 1940s the Bell System devised plans to consolidate the various incompatible local [[telephone numbering plan]]s of its constituent service areas into a unified network, that later became known as the [[North American Numbering Plan]] (NANP). This was a prerequisite to achieve [[Direct Distance Dialing]] (DDD) by customers, first implemented in Englewood, New Jersey in 1951. In addition to devising a unified numbering plan, [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]] reorganized the nationwide system that was spearheaded by [[AT&amp;T Long Lines]] of local [[telephone exchange]]s and central offices into a hierarchical network containing five levels, called ''classes'', of switching systems.

As long distance calling was originally established, it could take up to seven minutes to complete a connection to another major city, and small points would need to have ''call back'' appointments made with long lead times for circuits to be reserved.

The newly devised hierarchy was maintained into the early 1980s, when technological advances and business models rendered it increasingly obsolete, but the hierarchical features live on in terms, such as [[Class 4 telephone switch|Class 4]] and [[Class 5 telephone switch]], referring to tandem and end-office switches, respectively. The PSTN in the United States was essentially restructured with the 1984 divestiture of AT&amp;T. The old Long Lines network remained with AT&amp;T, but its internal routing became non-hierarchical with the introduction of advanced computer-controlled switching.  Each major long distance carrier can have its own internal routing policies, though they generally start with the same principles and even components.

With [[Bell System divestiture]], the network in the US was divided into [[local access and transport area]]s (LATAs). Calls within LATAs were carried by [[Local Exchange Carrier]]s (LECs), while calls between them were carried by [[interexchange carrier]]s (IXCs).  LATAs generally have one or more tandem switches which interconnect end office switches.

While the following discussion refers to AT&amp;T and (principally) to the United States, it is important to remember that until 1975, AT&amp;T controlled [[Bell Canada]] and thus influenced corporate decisions north of the border. Bell Canada provided local operations in most of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], and both in its capacity as the largest telecommunications carrier in Canada and because of its historic operations in the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic]] and [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie]] provinces, dominated decisions over long distance practices. Canadian authorities agreed that integration of Canadian long distance services into a trans-national network was valuable to both countries, so that U.S. and Canadian services were integrated for networking capabilities at an early stage into what eventually became the foundation for the [[North American Numbering Plan]] area.

By the mid-1920s, a revised manual system where "local" toll operators connected tandem routes (a process formally called Combined Line and Recording) as needed to complete telephone calls, reduced the process to an average of two minutes, but still meant that some complex routing might interconnect as many as sixteen points.  As long distance services grew in the Contiguous Continental US (48 states) and Canada, the amount of overhead equipment and people required to determine and establish Rates and Routes became excessive. As technology improved, network design included consideration of more automated and defined procedures. Thus, beginning with a switch installed in Philadelphia PA in 1943, AT&amp;T began to automate the system, and establish a new switch hierarchy, which lasted until the breakup of AT&amp;T in the 1980s.

The underlying principle of the five-level hierarchy was to provide economies of scale by establishing direct connections between centralized call "collection points" (essentially the Class 4 offices) where economically feasible, and to provide additional concentration points (Class 1 through 3) to handle overflow traffic that could not be handled directly, or to handle traffic to locations which were less likely to be dialed from a given point - usually longer distances and/or smaller locations in other parts of the North American dialing plan. The North American plan differed from those of other continents in the existence of three concentration levels of hierarchy for domestic (here defined as including all those points "within" the dialing plan) calls, a need not required where the larger geographic area was broken into several national plan jurisdictions. However, it is important to note that this was not a strict hierarchy of absolute levels. If enough call traffic existed between geographic areas, for example, a Class 4 office could have direct trunk connections not only to a Class 3 office, but to a Class 2 or Class 1 office, and vice versa. For example, the Class 2 switch in Toronto (TOROON0101T2) had connections not only to the Class 1 switch in Montréal (MTRLPQ0201T1), but to the Class 1 switch in White Plains (WHPLNY0201T1), one of the Class 2 switches in New York City (NYCMNYAA02T2) and a Class 3 switch in Buffalo (BFLONYFR04T3). Network engineers re-worked the system as necessary to balance off call completion percentages with budgetary limitations. In fact, minor changes were made almost every month.

Initially excluded from the development of the North American network were locations that eventually would become part of the North American Numbering Plan Area - Alaska, Hawaii, some other United States possessions, various outlying Northern and rural portions of Canada, and much of the Caribbean. These areas were handled as International Calls until more advanced computer hardware and software allowed them to be included in the automated, integrated systems in later decades. After the spread of stored program control switching, many services of Class 1 through 3 could be delegated to newer switches in the class 4 and 5 offices, and that portion of the network became obsolete, although it was partially replaced by the establishment of multiple long distance carrier networks, connected to the local networks through their [[point of presence|points of presence]].

===Class 1 (regional center)===
The class 1 office was the Regional Center (RC). Regional centers served three purposes in the North American toll network (a) their connections were the "last resort" for final setup of calls when routes between centers lower in the hierarchy were not available (b) they were initially staffed by engineers who had the authority to block portions of the network within the region in case of emergencies or network congestion - although these functions were transferred after 1962 to the Network Control/Operations Center and the distributed Network Management Centers (see below) (c) they provided collection points (until the development of more advanced computer hardware and software for toll operators) for circuits that would be passed along to one of the international overseas gateways (which operated as special centers outside the formal North American hierarchy). The regional centers updated each other on the status of every circuit in the network. These centers would then reroute traffic around the trouble spots and keep each informed at all times. There were twelve Regional Centers in North America, ten in the United States, nine of which were operated by AT&amp;T ([[White Plains, NY]], [[Wayne, PA]], [[Pittsburgh, PA]], [[Norway, Illinois|Norway, IL]] [a rural crossroads west of Chicago at the intersection of US highway 52 and IL highway 71 - an underground office built with hardened construction to withstand nuclear attack], [[Conyers, Georgia|Conyers, GA]] in [[Rockdale County, Georgia|Rockdale County]], [[St Louis, MO]], [[Dallas, TX]], [[Denver, CO]], and [[Sacramento, CA]]), one by GTE ([[San Bernardino, CA]]). Two centres in Canada were operated on behalf of the Trans-Canada Telephone System, one by Bell Canada ([[Montréal, PQ]]), and one by [[SaskTel|Saskatchewan Telephone]], ([[Regina, SK]]).

For control and oversight of the entire network hierarchy, AT&amp;T established a Network Control Center in [[New York City]] in 1962, renamed the Network Operations Center and relocated to [[Bedminster, NJ]] in 1977. Engineering supervision was also centralized in eight regional Network Management Centers. The realignment and dispersion of functions were done, in part, to ensure maximum network integrity in the event of a national emergency, a major concern in that era. The basic structure of this unit, although significantly altered since the [[AT&amp;T divestiture]] in the 1980s, still exists as the Global Operations Center, with domestic regional centers in Colorado and Georgia.

===Class 2 (sectional center)===
The class 2 office was the Sectional Center (SC). The sectional center typically connected major toll centers within one or two states or provinces, or a significant portion of a large state or province, to provide interstate or interprovincial connections for long-distance calls. At various times, there were between 50 and 75 active class two offices in the network.

===Class 3 (primary center)===
The class 3 office was the Primary Center (PC).  Calls being made beyond the limits of a small geographical area where circuits are not connected directly between class 4 toll offices would be passed from the toll center to the primary center. These locations use high usage trunks to complete connection between toll centers. The primary center never served dial tone to the user. The number of primary centers in the network fluctuated from time to time, ranging between 150 and 230.

===Class 4 (toll center)===
{{Main|Class 4 telephone switch}}
The class 4 office is the Toll Center (TC), Toll Point (TP), or Intermediate Point (IP). A call going between two end offices not directly connected, or whose direct trunks are busy, is routed through the toll center. The toll center is also used to connect to the long-distance network for calls where added costs are incurred, such as operator handled services. This toll center may also be called the tandem office because calls have to pass through this location to get to another part of the network. Toll centers might have been operated either as interstate facilities, under the operation of AT&amp;T Long Lines (GTE in a few cases), or by local telephone companies, handling long distance traffic to points within a particular operating company territory. Class 4 offices continue to exist, although with considerable changes, as they handle local exchange company interconnections, locally charged or long distance rated, or provide facilities for connection to long distance company points of presence.

===Class 5 (local exchange)===
{{Main|Class 5 telephone switch}}
The class 5 office is the local exchange or end office. It delivers dial tone to the customer. The end office, also called a branch exchange, is the closest connection to the end customer. Over 19,000 end offices in the United States alone provide basic [[dial tone]] services.

In modern times only the terms Class 4 and Class 5 are much used, as any tandem office is referred to as a Class 4. This change was prompted in great part by changes in the power of switches and the relative cost of transmission, both of which tended to flatten the switch hierarchy. The breakup of the Bell System, and the need for each of the surviving regional operating companies to handle long distance interconnections, also promoted the inclusion of inter-regional and international processing through larger Class 4 offices.

===International overseas call centers===
The special requirements of placing calls to locations outside main Canadian/United States points meant that these calls were handled by special operators in locations where connections could be monitored to other countries. The technology to automate these connections through "regular" operator traffic positions  began to develop in the 1960s (see Bell Laboratories Record 42:7, July–August 1964). As the decade of the 1970s progressed, North American customers who were served by electronic offices began to be able to directly dial to an increasing number of international points, a service known as [[IDDD]] (International Direct Distance Dialing), (service between ESS offices in New York and London began on March 1, 1970). However, since points could not be connected until equipment in both countries was converted to electronic switching, implementation to many locations took some time, and while the majority of calls began to be connected via automated systems by the 1990s - after the termination of the five-level hierarchy - the majority of countries were still connected via manual intervention until the beginning of the 21st century.

Please note that the currently attached diagram of switch hierarchy is incorrect, as it identifies Class 1 points with International switching. International connections were located in places generally close to cable, later satellite, termination locations, and were not directly related to Class 1 switches. Major international connection points were located in Oakland, California; Miami, Florida; and New York, New York, with a number of secondary international operator toll points. Only after the rapid expansion of ESS terminal offices did operator handling of international calls begin to be off-loaded into the domestic network structure, as international calling services began to be customer dialable, ca. the mid-1980s. This in part paralleled the demise of the five-level hierarchy, so identification of international switches and class one offices is incorrect.

==United Kingdom==
The forerunner of [[British Telecom]], the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]], also organized its intercity trunk network along similar hierarchical lines to that of North America. However, because of the significantly smaller geographic area involved, fewer levels of connection were required, and no formal numbering of class offices was made.

There were a few special exceptions to the following description, notably those involving [[Northern Ireland]], some of the [[Channel Islands|Channel Dependencies]], and the few locations in England which were served by non-GPO companies, such as [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] ([[KCOM Group]]) and [[Portsmouth]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In the early days of manual exchanges, outlying areas (eventually called dependent exchanges) were connected through progressively larger locations (eventually called group switching centres) into one of the main cities - [[Birmingham]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]], [[Liverpool]], [[London]], and [[Manchester]]. As automation began to be established in the network, this was refined into a system of approximately fifty tandem locations for Group Switching Centres, with an additional layer of perhaps a dozen Wide Area Tandems to provide for busy periods, emergency routing, etc. There were also some additional Local Tandems to handle traffic in the London Metropolitan Area without involving the GSCs, although this was a later development, as it required common control signalling for identification.

===Subscriber trunk dialing===
The dialing codes used by trunk operators to connect calls were originally assigned and established to ensure speed with pulse dialing equipment. With the advent of subscriber dialed calls, numbering patterns were reassigned to provide for mnemonic methods of improving customer performance. [[Subscriber trunk dialling]] (STD) codes all began with 0. The largest cities, which had seven digit local numbers, were allocated special codes - London, 01; Birmingham, 021; etc. Smaller towns were typically allocated a code based on the first letters of their name, translated into digits on the telephone dial. For example, OXford translated into 09 on the British phone dial, so the original STD code for Oxford was 0096. However, because of subscriber dialing errors, there was an early decision to eliminate codes that began with ''00'' and Oxford soon became 0865, the sequence ''86'' designating the first two letter of ''university''.

Some of the smallest towns connected to the trunk network only through nearby switches. In those cases, STD codes were composed of combination of the code for the nearby switch, plus some additional digits that were unused in that nearby switch, but which served two purposes (1) to identify the end location, and allow the nearby switch to complete the call (2) to "pad out" the overall length of the dialing string, since a small town might only have a three-digit telephone number, and allow the network to move to a more-standard number length.

As [[Strowger switch|step offices]] became rarer, Subscriber Trunk Dialing Codes no longer followed the original rules, and were significantly revised in the mid-1990s, with further changes as wider use of mobile phones and non-BT competition came into the UK market. There are now some 70000 local exchange codes in use in the UK{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. The largest trunk carrier, British Telecom, connects the local network through some 60 transit (tandem) switches.

==France==

===Early days===
The early history of the telecommunications switching [[Telecommunications in France|network in France]] is, unusually for this country, one of decentralized development. Early telephone exchanges were installed by local communities, often by private companies, and only later taken over by the French government. As a result, by 1930, France was served by almost 25,000 local exchanges, but almost half of these had fewer than five subscribers. Additionally, telephones were not considered important for residential customers (nor for small businesses), so France had a low penetration rate of telephone subscribers.

Under these conditions, early network development revolved around two major distinctions, "Paris" and "not Paris." Within metropolitan Paris, automated step switches appeared, with a level of tandem switching, before World War II. In the rest of the country, automation was confined to major cities, with a high level of manual intervention.

The French telephone system was heavily damaged in World War II, so that by the end of the War only about 140 automatic exchanges (mostly in Paris and its "banlieues") and 228 manual exchanges were fully operational. Repair of much of the network had been deferred during the war due to lack of parts, as well as co-opting of technical personnel for German military needs.

===Postwar recovery===
Recovery was rapid after the war, and the extensive damage in some ways helped the modernization of the system as new technology was introduced. The DGT (Direction Générale des Télécommunications) introduced automated operator dialing of long distance connections, generally using the [[INSEE]] codes as "area codes" for the various departments - with special handling for Paris. These codes subsequently became public as customer dialing of long distance calls began to be introduced in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

The network had a minimal hierarchy, with most connections routed into a central tandem in each department, and from there to Paris. As greater installation of private telephones, for both small business and private residences, increased in the 1970s, direct connections among the tandems in adjacent regions were installed, and a three-level tier of switches, local, tandem, and regional interconnection was implemented, with final routing through Paris. Also, during the 1970s and 1980s, the smaller rural switches were replaced and combined with nearby automated offices, and a closed numbering scheme was adopted for dialing consistency.

===Technological development===
In common with most countries, the development of technology allowed for different networking, and the maintenance of a formal hierarchy disappeared into a distributed network. By the mid-1990s, a revised structure had appeared, reflected by the replacement of the old departmental area codes by the assignment of regional codes and a major renumbering scheme for strategic planning, privatization, and deregulation under the auspices of ART, the {{lang|fr|[[Autorité de Régulation des Communications Électroniques et des Postes]]}} (Regulatory Authority for Telecommunications - since 2005, ARCEP, as responsibility for postal services was added). After 1996, the country prepared for complete deregulation of the telephone network.

Thus, the local exchanges ({{lang|fr|zones à autonomie d'acheminement}}) are connected somewhat differently by various carriers. However, the largest of these, based upon the (partially) privatised former government network, is a two-level long distance hierarchy, based on 80 CTS (centre de transit secondaire) and 8 CTP (centre de transit primaire) locations. In addition, there are 12 CTI (centre de transit internationaux) for connections to areas which are not integrated into the French telephone network [note that some overseas locations are considered "domestic" for telecommunications purposes].

'''Paraguayan Spanish''' ({{lang-es|español paraguayo}}) is a version of the [[Spanish language]] spoken in [[Paraguay]]. In addition, it influences the speech of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] provinces of [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], [[Formosa Province|Formosa]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Chaco Province|Chaco]]. 

The [[Guarani language]] is co-official with Spanish in Paraguay,&lt;ref name="March 2012 NYT Article"&gt;Simon Romero, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/world/americas/in-paraguay-indigenous-language-with-unique-staying-power.html "An Indigenous Language With Unique Staying Power"], ''The New York Times'', March 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and most Paraguayans speak both languages.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Long, [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/59795840.html?dids=59795840:59795840&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+13%2C+1988&amp;author=WILLIAM+R.+LONG&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=Native+Guarani+Vies+With+Spanish+Paraguay%27s+2+Languages+Source+of+Pride%2C+Concern&amp;pqatl=google "Native Guarani Vies with Spanish Paraguay's 2 Languages Source of Pride, Concern"], ''Los Angeles Times'', April 13, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Guaraní is the home language of more than half the population of Paraguay, with higher proportions of its use in rural areas, and those who speak Spanish at home slightly in the majority in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Choi, 2005, "Bilingualism in Paraguay: Forty Years After Rubin's Study". ''Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development'', 26(3), 233-248, as cited by Sarah Gevene Hopton Tyler, 2010, "[http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/Tyler_uncg_0154M_10443.pdf Intergenerational Linguistic Changes to the Spanish Dialect of Three Participant Groups from Greater Asunción (Paraguay)]", M.A. thesis, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swedish linguist Bertil Malmberg visited Paraguay in 1946 and observed several features of Spanish pronunciation that he attributed to Guaraní influence.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flórez, [http://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0LEVzUKq1tWAM4AioxXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByMHZ0NG9yBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwM3BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1448876938/RO=10/RU=http%3a%2f%2fcvc.cervantes.es%2flengua%2fthesaurus%2fpdf%2f06%2fTH_06_002_121_0.pdf/RK=0/RS=KpZZU6JpI7xJI_.7CWDJ39bVonw- review of Malmberg's ''Notas sobre la fonética del español en el Paraguay''] (Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, 1947), in ''Thesaurus: Boletín del Instituto Caro y Cuervo'', 6 (1950), 301.&lt;/ref&gt; The Guaraní origin of many of these features, however, has been questioned  by other researchers, who document them in dialects not in contact with Guaraní.&lt;ref&gt;For example Paul Cassano, "The Substrat Theory in Relation to the Bilingualism of Paraguay: Problems and Findings", in ''Anthropological Linguistics'', 15 (1973), 406-426, as cited in D. Lincoln Canfield, ''Spanish Pronunciation in the Americas'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The unique features of Paraguayan Spanish developed in part due to Paraguay's early isolation; for example, [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]], the country's president until 1840, sealed Paraguay's borders. Other experiences with geographic, political, and economic isolation relative to its neighbours allowed Spanish spoken in Paraguay to develop its own unique characteristics, even apart from the wide-ranging influence of Guarani.&lt;ref name="March 2012 NYT Article" /&gt;

Paraguayan Spanish shares many similarities with [[Rioplatense Spanish]] (that is, the variety spoken in [[Argentina]]) such as the use of the [[voseo]] and various words and phrases.

*Like all American dialects of Spanish, Paraguayan Spanish has [[seseo]], so that it lacks the distinction between {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} that is present in Standard European Spanish.
*Syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}} is pronounced as {{IPAblink|ɹ}} (as in American English '''''r'''ed'') before {{IPA|/l/}} or {{IPA|/s/}}, influenced by a substrate from Native American languages; ''perla'' ('pearl') and ''verso'' ("verse") are pronounced {{IPA|[ˈpeɹla]}} and {{IPA|[ˈbeɹso]}}.
*Absence of ''[[yeísmo]]'', the historical merger of the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/ʎ/}} (spelled &lt;ll&gt;) with {{IPA|/ʝ/}} (spelled &lt;y&gt;). For speakers with ''yeísmo'', the verbs ''cayó'' 's/he fell' and ''calló'' 's/he fell silent' are [[homophone]]s, both pronounced {{IPA|[kaˈʝo]}}. (In dialects that lack ''yeísmo'', maintaining the historical distinction, the two words are pronounced respectively {{IPA|[kaˈʝo]}} and {{IPA|[kaˈʎo]}}.) ''Yeísmo'' characterizes the speech of most Spanish-speakers both in Spain and in the Americas.

A '''phrop''' is an attempted [[neologism]] used to indicate a polite statement used in social contexts where the true meaning is the opposite of what is expressed.  An example is the parting comment ''We must have lunch sometime'', meaning ''We don't particularly want to meet again''.  The term was coined by mountaineer [[Sir Arnold Lunn]]. It has not entered common use.

'''Providence Island Sign Language''' (also known as '''Provisle''' or "Providencia Sign Language") is a [[village sign language]] of the small island community of [[San Andrés and Providencia|Providence Island]] in the Western [[Caribbean]], off the coast of [[Nicaragua]] but belonging to [[Colombia]]. The island is about {{convert|15|sqmi|km2}} and the total population is about 5000, of which an unusual proportion are deaf (5 in 1,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lattig MC, Gelvez N, Plaza SL, Tamayo G, Uribe JI, Salvatierra I, Bernal JE, Tamayo ML |title=Deafness on the island of Providencia - Colombia: different etiology, different genetic counseling.|journal=Genetic Counseling|volume= 19 |issue= 4 |pages= 403–12 |year= 2008 |pmid=19239084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the sign language emerged in the late 19th or early 20th century. Brief sociological studies have suggested that deaf people on the island are regarded as inferior in mental ability; hearing people do not discuss complex ideas with them, and they hold a marginalized social position. Perhaps consequently, PISL is rather simplistic in comparison to other sign languages. Another possibility for the state of the language is that few deaf people communicate directly, meaning that almost all signing is mediated by the hearing population.&lt;ref name=MSPA&gt;{{cite book|last1= Meir |first1= Irit |last2= Sandler |first2= Wendy |last3= Padden |first3= Carol |author-link3= Carol Padden |last4= Aronoff |first4= Mark |author-link4= Mark Aronoff |year= 2010 |chapter= Chapter 18: Emerging sign languages |chapter-url= http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/EMERGING_SIGN_LANGUAGES.pdf |chapter-format=

'''Serengeti-Dorobo''' (a nonce name) is an obscure "[[Dorobo peoples|Dorobo]]" language, a few words of which were recorded in the late 19th century by Oscar Baumann. From the little data available, the language is not obviously related to any other. It is not the only "Dorobo" language formerly spoken in the Serengeti.

These online relationships may help facilitate interactions that would not have occurred face-to-face due to factors such as [[geography]] and [[intergroup anxiety]].

==Overview==

=== Origins ===
Beginning in the 1990s, after the advent of the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]], interest grew in studying how the Internet impacted the ways people communicate with each other. [[Joseph Walther]], a communication and media theorist, said that computer-mediated communication (CMC) users can adapt to this restricted medium and use it effectively to develop close relationships. Walther understood that to describe the new nature of online communication required a new theory.&lt;ref name="Walther92" /&gt; Social information processing theory focuses on the social processes that occur when two or more people are engaged in communication, similar to theories such as [[social presence theory]], [[social penetration theory]], and [[uncertainty reduction theory]]. What makes SIP different from these theories is its distinct focus on communication mediated solely by [[Information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]]. While other media theories exist, such as [[media richness theory]] and [[uses and gratifications theory]], SIP specifically focuses on ''relationships'' entirely mediated online.&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Em|title=Social Information Processing Theory of Joseph Walther|url=http://www.afirstlook.com/edition_8/theory_resources/Social_Information_Processing_Theory|work=A First Look at Communication Theory 8th Ed.|publisher=McGraw Hill|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The cues filtered-out theories ===
Unlike some theories that are rooted in other theoretical perspectives from various fields of study, SIP was conceptualized, in part, by addressing the shortcomings of other theories that addressed communication mediums. These theories are termed cues filtered-out theories. Cues filtered-out theories refer to theories that address the lack of nonverbal cues as being detrimental to online relationship development. Walther's research critiqued past methodological and conceptual problems with theoretical thinking. He subsequently worked toward establishing an interpersonal communication theory that more accurately reflected the intersection among communication, online environments, the self and relationships. Two of those theoretical perspective that influenced Walther's theory are social presence theory and media richness theory. Walther believes that both SPS and MRT suffer from a limited understanding of relational life online. He argues that if interactants communicate enough times and with sufficient breadth and depth, nonverbal communication does not remain paramount in relationship development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|last=West|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2013|isbn=978-0073534282|location=|pages=232, 233|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forms of Self ===
One of the most important aspects of online interaction is the presentation of [[Self]]. Tory Higgins (1987) described three main forms of self: actual self, ideal self, and ought self. ''Actual self'' is the set of qualities and characteristics that person actually possesses, the ''ideal self'' contains the attributes that a person hopes to someday achieve, and the ''ought self'' contains the attributes that a person believes he/she should possess.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bargh|first=John A.|last2=McKenna|first2=Katelyn Y. A.|last3=Fitzsimons|first3=Grainne M.|date=2002-01-01|title=Can You See the Real Me? Activation and Expression of the "True Self" on the Internet|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=58|issue=1|pages=33–48|doi=10.1111/1540-4560.00247|issn=1540-4560|url=http://rcin.org.pl/Content/48382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Rogers]] (1951) posited that there was another form of self, one that is not concerned with the future like the ideal and ought self. He called it the true self: a present form of self that exists psychologically and is not always fully expressed within social settings like the actual self.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Bargh, McKenna, and Fitzsimons (2002) conducted an experiment to test how the actual self and true self are expressed by people in face-to-face and computer-mediated interactions, and found that the actual self was more accessible following an initial face-to-face interaction, while the true self was more accessible following an initial interaction online. From the results of their study, the researchers concluded that people tend to like each other better when they meet online instead of meeting face-to-face.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Assumptions ===
Social information processing researchers like Joseph Walther are intrigued by how identities are managed online and how relationships are able to move from one of superficiality to one of intimacy. Three assumptions related to the SIP theory are listed below:
* [[Computer-mediated communication]] provides unique opportunities to connect with people.
The first assumption rests on the premise that computer-mediated communication is a unique opportunity to build interpersonal relationships with others. The CMC systems are vast and almost always text based. It has been identified as "an organic setting" and it can be both synchronous and asynchronous. CMC is clearly different than face-to-face communication, but it offers an unparalleled opportunity to meet someone whom you would never meet FtF. Moreover, relationships established via CMC systems also prompt emotions and feelings we find in all relationships. Finally, since CMC systems are available around the globe, the uniqueness of being able to cultivate online relationships with someone who is very far away cannot be ignored.
* Online communicators are motivated to form (favorable) impressions of themselves to others.
The second assumption alludes that impression management is essential in online relationships and participants undertake efforts to ensure particular impressions. Researchers have found that social networking sites (SNS) like Facebook are filled with people who wish to provide a number of different self-presentations to others. Thus, how others present and manage themselves online remains important on various SNS and on numerous CMC system platforms.
* Online interpersonal relationships require extended time and more accumulated messages to develop equivalent levels of intimacy seen in FtF interpersonal relationships.
The third assumption of SIP states that different rates of information exchange and information accrual affect relationship development.  Social information processing theory is suggesting that although the messages are verbal, communicators "adapt" to the restrictions of online medium, look for cues in the messages from others, and modify their language to the extent that the words compensate for the lack of nonverbal cues.This third assumption reflects Walther's contention that given sufficient time and accrual of messages, online relationships have the same capacity to become intimate as those that are established face to face. In addition, online comments are usually delivered rather quickly and efficiently. Further, these messages "build up" over time and provide online participants sufficient information from which to begin and develop interpersonal relationships.

== Key concepts and features ==

=== Hyperpersonal perspective ===

==== Three phases of CMC ====
Social information processing theory describes computer-mediated communication as a process including three phases: impersonal, to interpersonal, and finally to hyperpersonal.

In the ''impersonal phase'', due to the lack of nonverbal cues, CMC is believed to be more task-oriented than traditional face-to-face communication. Since the content is not influenced by social and emotional influence, it can avoid overly personal interpersonal interaction, promote rationality by providing essential discipline, facilitate the efficiency of group work through getting rid of peer pressure and hierarchy, and ultimately, create a more "democratic" atmosphere within organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walther | first1 = J. B. | year = 1996 | title = Computer-mediated communication: Impersonal, interpersonal, and hyperpersonal interaction | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 3–43 | doi=10.1177/009365096023001001| title-link = Interpersonal communication }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''interpersonal phase'', the nonverbal cues are lean and as the communication time increases, the exchange of social information increases accordingly. The anticipation of future communication may make communicators to look for more information about the other. This mechanism leads to similar immediacy, similarity, composure, and receptivity as in FtF communication.

In the [[Hyperpersonal model|''hyperpersonal phase'']], The sender uses the process of selective [[Impression management|self-presentation]]. People who meet online have a better opportunity to make a favorable impression on the other. This is because the communicators can decide which information they would like to share about themselves by controlling their self-presentations online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Sullivan | first1 = B | year = 2000 | title = What you don't know won't hurt me | url = | journal = Human Communication Research | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 403–431 | doi=10.1093/hcr/26.3.403}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving them the power to disclose only their good traits. SIP has, at its core, [[impression management]]. Communication Scholars define impression management as either a strategic or unconscious effort to influence another's perception. Much of the earlier research on impression management focused on FtF communication and the nuances with meeting someone. A person's self-image was viewed as important in relational development. Later applications of impression management were undertaken once online communication began.

Selective-Presentation is not as likely to occur in FtF communication due to the ability to observe all the obvious traits in person.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; The receivers may idealize the senders based on making attributions from available paralingual cues found in the message. This process is enhanced with asynchronous exchanges, letting both sender and receiver have ample time to consider the messages sent and received.  In the absence of FtF contextual cues, the likelihood of over-attributing given information of the sender is increased, often creating an idealized image of the message sender. This is also known as [[Social identity model of deindividuation effects|social-identity-deindividuation]] (or SIDE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=POSTMES|first=T.|author2=SPEARS, R. |author3=LEA, M. |title=Breaching or Building Social Boundaries?: SIDE-Effects of Computer-Mediated Communication|journal=Communication Research|date=1 December 1998|volume=25|issue=6|pages=689–715|doi=10.1177/009365098025006006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, over-attribution is also found in online dating. While reading a perspective date's profile, the reader is likely to see themselves as similar to one another and therefore become more interested than they originally would have been. Finally, the feedback process addresses the reciprocal influence of the senders and the receivers. They develop impressions and intimacy as a result of their interaction.

==== Four elements of hyperpersonal model ====
The hyperpersonal perspective is more than saying that an online relationship is intimate. Walther, in a number of different scholarly venues, articulated its complexity and some other scholars elucidate the four components he studied: senders; receivers; channel; and feedback. These four also constitute many of the models of communication.
* Sender: Selective Self-Presentation
According to Walther, senders have the ability to present themselves in highly strategic and highly positive ways. This self-presentation is controlled and it serves as a foundation for how CMC users get to know one another. The fundamental underpinning of this component of the hyperpersonal perspective is affinity seeking. That is, senders provide information online that prompts affinity in others.
* Receiver: Idealization of the Sender
At the core of this component in the hyperpersonal perspective is attribution. Attributions are those evaluations and judgements we make based on the actions or behaviors of others. The receiver tends to attribute and, according to the theory, the receiver may "overattribute", which means that a receiver is likely to think that a sender has more similarities than differences. Further, a receiver may experience an overreliance on the minimal cues available online and forget that the relationship he or she has with a sender is based on words.
* Channel Management
The asynchronous nature of CMC allows online participants to think about texts or emails before sending them. Further, prior to sending messages, you can rewrite them for clarity, sense, and relevancy. Online asynchronous experiences allow for "optimal and desirable" communication, ensuring that the messages are of high quality. Walther contends that the more relational the affection or more desirable the other communicator is, the more editing in message composition.
* Feedback
Walther interprets feedback as behavioral confirmation, which is a "reciprocal influence that partners exert". In communication theory, we refer to this as [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. This prophecy essentially is a tendency for an individual's expectation of a target person to evoke a response from that person which, in turn, reaffirms the original prediction. Walther's hyperpersonal perspective acknowledges a feedback system this way: "When a receiver gets a selectively self-presented message and idealizes its source, that individual may respond in a way that reciprocates and reinforces the partially modified personae, reproducing, enhancing, and potentially exaggerating them". Because cues in an online environment are limited, the feedback that does occur is often exaggerated or magnified.

The four components—sender, receiver, channel, and feedback—suggest that the hyperpersonal perspective is a process which is ongoing and dynamic. Walther concludes that SIP is a "process" theory because both information and interpersonal meaning is accumulated over time, providing online partners an opportunity to establish a relationship.

==== Experiments ====
Two researches were carried out by Walther and his colleagues from 1992 to 1994, focusing on the channel management of the computer-mediated communication. Summary of the two experiments are as followed.

Around the time in 1992 when Walther produced and published the Social Information Processing theory, he and his colleagues conducted an experiment, examining the effects of time and communication channel—asynchronous computer conferencing versus face-to-face meetings—on relational communication in groups. Prior research on the relational aspects of computer-mediated communication has suggested strong depersonalizing effects of the medium due to the absence of nonverbal cues. Past research is criticized for failing to incorporate temporal and developmental perspectives on information processing and relational development. In this study, data were collected from 96 subjects assigned to computer conferencing or face-to-face zero-history groups of 3, who completed three tasks over several weeks' time. Results showed that computer-mediated groups increased in several relational dimensions to more positive levels and that these subsequent levels approximated those of face-to-face groups. Boundaries on the predominant theories of computer-mediated communication are recommended, and principles from [[Uncertainty reduction theory|uncertainty reduction]] and social penetration are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=B.|first=Walther, Joseph|last2=K.|first2=Burgoon, Judee|date=1992-09-01|title=Relational Communication in Computer‐Mediated Interaction|journal=Human Communication Research|language=en|volume=19|issue=1|pages=50|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1992.tb00295.x|issn=1468-2958|hdl=10150/185294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Walther and his colleagues did follow-up research. Previous research on the interpersonal tone of computer-mediated communication shows different effects using longitudinal computer-mediated groups than are found in research using one-shot groups, even before the developmental aspects associated with time can accrue. One factor distinguishing these approaches is the anticipation of future interaction experienced by longitudinal groups. This research reports an experiment assessing the relative effects of anticipated future interaction and different communication media (computer-mediated versus face-to-face communication) on the communication of relational intimacy and composure. Asynchronous and synchronous computer conferencing and face-to-face groups were examined. Results show that the assignment of long-term versus short-term partnerships has a larger impact on anticipated future interaction reported by computer-mediated, rather than face-to-face, partners. Evidence also shows that anticipation is a more potent predictor of several relational communication dimensions than is communication condition. Implications for theory and practice are identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walther|first=Joseph B.|date=1994-06-01|title=Anticipated Ongoing Interaction Versus Channel Effects on Relational Communication in Computer-Mediated Interaction|journal=Human Communication Research|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=473–501|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1994.tb00332.x|issn=1468-2958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evaluation of SIP: Intimacy ====
Several theorists have explored the differences in intimacy developed through CMC versus face-to-face communication. Walther is convinced that the length of time that CMC users have to send their messages is the key factor that determines whether their messages can achieve the same level of [[intimacy]] that others develop face-to-face. Over an extended period the issue is not the amount of social information that can be conveyed online; rather, it is the rate at which the information builds up. Any message spoken in person will take at least four times longer to communicate through CMC. When comparing 10 minutes of face-to-face conversation with 40 minutes of CMC, there was no difference in partner affinity between the two modes. Anticipated future interaction is a way of extending physiological time, which gives the likelihood of future interaction and motivates CMC users to develop a relationship. Relational messages provide interactants with information about the nature of the relationship, the interactants' status in the relationship, and the [[social context]] within which the interaction occurs.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Susanne|date=March 2009|title=Relational Messages|url=http://www.sage-ereference.com/abstract/humanrelationships/n438.xml|journal=Encyclopedia of Human Relationships|volume=3|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Evolution of cooperation|shadow of the future]]" motivates people to encounter others on a more personal level. A [[Chronemics|chronemic]] cue is a type of nonverbal cue not filtered out of CMC and indicates how one perceives, uses, or responds to issues of time.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Unlike tone of voice, interpersonal distance, or gestures, times is the one nonverbal cue that cannot be filtered out of CMC. For example, a person can send a text message at a certain time of the day and when a response is received he or she can gauge how much time elapsed between messages. Social information processing theory says that a prompt reply signals deference and liking in a new relationship or business context. A delayed response may indicate receptivity and more liking in an intimate relationship; partners who are comfortable with each other do not need to reply as quickly.&lt;ref name="GRIFFIN"&gt;GRIFFIN, E. M. (2009). A first look at communication theory. (seventh ed., p. 486). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Walther, with his colleagues, conducted another investigation which examined how computer-mediated communication (CMC) partners exchange personal information in initial interactions, focusing on the effects of communication channels on self-disclosure, question-asking, and [[Uncertainty reduction theory|uncertainty reduction]]. Unacquainted individuals (N = 158) met either face-to-face or via CMC. Computer-mediated interactants exhibited a greater proportion of more direct and intimate uncertainty reduction behaviors than unmediated participants did, and demonstrated significantly greater gains in attributional confidence over the course of the conversations. The use of direct strategies by mediated interactants resulted in judgments of greater conversational effectiveness by partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tidwell|first=Lisa Collins|last2=Walther|first2=Joseph B.|date=2002-07-01|title=Computer-Mediated Communication Effects on Disclosure, Impressions, and Interpersonal Evaluations: Getting to Know One Another a Bit at a Time|journal=Human Communication Research|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=317–348|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2002.tb00811.x|issn=1468-2958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Dr. Kevin B. Wright, examined the difference in developing and maintaining relationships both exclusively and primarily online.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Kevin B.|date=June 2004|title=ON-LINE RELATIONAL MAINTENANCE STRATEGIES AND PERCEPTIONS OF PARTNERS WITHIN EXCLUSIVELY INTERNET-BASED AND PRIMARILY INTERNET-BASED RELATIONSHIPS|journal=Communication Studies|volume=55|issue=2|pages=239–253|doi=10.1080/10510970409388617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Wright has found the effectiveness of "openness and positivity" in online communication versus avoidance in offline relationships.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

=== Warranting  ===

==== Origin ====
Walther and Parks noticed that people often meet offline after having first met online. Sometimes these experiences are positive, and other times negative. They are dissatisfied with existing theories' ability to explain these phenomena. To fill in the theoretical gap, Walther and Parks adopt the original concept of warranting presented by Stone, describing connections between one's self and self-presentation as a continuum rather than a binary, moderated by anonymity. They suggested that the potential for anonymity resulted in the potential for a discrepancy along this continuum. The greater this potential discrepancy, the more compelling it is for observers to be skeptical of information provided by the individual about the self. Warrants, as described by Walther and Parks, are perceived reliable cues that observers use to gauge how one's true identity matches that which is presented online.

According to Walther, "Warranting pertains to the perceived legitimacy and validity of information about another person that one may receive or observe online."&lt;ref&gt;Walther, Joseph B., and Eun-Ju Lee. "23. Computer-mediated Communication." Interpersonal Communication (2014): n. pag. Web&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, individuals have come to learn a lot about each other through online discussion groups or online role-playing games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parks | first1 = M.

As such, there are many factors – photographs, videos, and the ability to build your own profile – that set social media apart from the text-only CMC that Walther originally studied. For example, if a person describes him or herself as a quiet, reserved person but friends add pictures of him or her out at a bar with a large group of people. These two ideas contradict each other. How the person processes this contradiction is the main idea of Walther's [[warranting theory]].&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

"If the information we're reading has warranting value, then it gives us reason to believe it is true."&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; This value is defined as the extent to which the cue is perceived to be unaltered by the target. Warrants that are very difficult to manipulate by the user are considered high in warranting value. They are more likely to be accepted as truth. An example of this is information added to your profile by others because the owner cannot easily change it (Others-generated warrants). Partial warranting is another example. It is information that, though provided by the user, contains easily verifiable facts. The numerical information, such as height, weight, age, or address constitutes as partial warranting, as these figures are easily checked and provide little room for gray area. Low warrant information is easily manipulated and therefore less believable. It is much more questionable in terms of accuracy (Walther &amp; Parks, 2002). An example of this is information self-reported on personal profile pages. These can range from interests and hobbies, to other personal details (also known as constraining information, which is not easily verified but restricts identity).

==== Experiment ====
Walther, Van Der Heide, Kim, Westerman, and Tong (2008),&lt;ref name="The Role of Friends' Appearance and Behavior on Evaluations of Individuals on Facebook: Are We Known by the Company We Keep?"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walther|first=Joseph|date=January 2008|title=The Role of Friends' Appearance and Behavior on Evaluations of Individuals on Facebook: Are We Known by the Company We Keep?|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=34|issue=1|pages=28–49|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2007.00312.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; wanted to explore if the attractiveness of friends, as well as what these friends said on an individual's profile, had an effect on social attraction. They investigated the topic by assigning random participants to view fake [[Facebook]] pages.

This experiment had two phases. In the first phase, researchers displayed two comments from friends of a profile with neutral content. The small profile pictures of commenting friends were either attractive or unattractive, and the comments suggested either socially desirable or socially undesirable behaviors. It was found that social attractiveness was positively [[correlated]] with the physical attractiveness of commenting friends (Walther et al., 2008). This indicates that the simple observable presence of others in one's social network may be enough to make social judgments. In the second phase, researchers tested the effects of self-generated information against information generated by others. Walther et al. (2009) compared subjects reactions to fake Facebook profiles and their judgments of [[extroversion]] and [[introversion]]. Profiles contained either self-generated information suggesting the profile owner was introverted or extroverted, and others-generated statements suggesting the owner was introverted or extroverted. Information suggesting introversion was considered negative while information suggestion extroversion was considered to be positive. Walther et al. (2009) found that while others-generated statements do indeed have an effect on observer judgments, the effect did not override self-generated information or negativity effects.

His experiments confirmed that people value high warrant information.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; It found that credibility levels and attractiveness were swayed by comments made on the profile by people other than its owner.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; It also confirmed his beliefs by comparing high and low warrant information and finding that friends' remarks were valued higher than the owner's claims in regards to physical attractiveness and outgoingness. These studies have found that, unlike email, communication comes from both the owner and other users of social media and viewers do not give these two opinions equal value.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

=== Synchronous and asynchronous communication ===
Synchronous communication refers to interactions that occur in real-time, where participants in a conversation are actively communicating while online at the same time. Examples of online synchronous communication would be text messages and other instant messaging platforms, as well as internet telephony, such as [[FaceTime]] and [[Skype]]. Asynchronous communication, on the other hand, occurs when conversation participants are not online at the same time, and messages are left for the other to receive. Examples of online asynchronous communication include voicemails, emails, blogs, and social media sites.&lt;ref name="Taipale 80–94"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taipale|first=Sakari|date=2016-01-02|title=Synchronicity matters: defining the characteristics of digital generations|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=1|pages=80–94|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2015.1093528|issn=1369-118X|url=http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:jyu-201601111054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study in [[Finland]] suggested that it is synchronicity, not online social use in general, that separates generations in the Digital Age. The study collected data from a survey of over 600 people, ranging from age 15–65, and categorized its participants by 3 distinct generations: Digital Immigrants, or DI (born before 1989); the First Digital Generation, and 1DG (born between 1980–1989, who were exposed to early digital technologies at a relatively young age), and the Second Digital Generation, or 2DG (born after 1990, who mostly grew up with digital technologies). A survey revealed multiple differences in online communication methods between 1DG and 2DG. First, 75% of 1DG reported using online blogs (an asynchronous method), while 59% of 2DG reported using it. Also, 48% of 1DG reported using instant messaging (a synchronous method), while 77% of 2DG reported using it. Of the other 3 online methods tested (internet calls, social networking sites, and discussion forums), 2DG had the highest usage rate of the three generations. DI had significantly lower results for each method except internet calls, which was within 12% across all 3 generations. This data reveals that everyone is using the internet for social purposes, but that younger generations of the [[Digital Age]] prefer synchronous communication methods, while older generations tend to use asynchronous communication more often.&lt;ref name="Taipale 80–94"/&gt;

Burgoon, Chen, and Twitchell (2010) also conducted an experiment to test how synchronicity affects online interactions. They had their participants conduct team-oriented tasks, and used different methods of communication to observe how people perceived their fellow team members. They proposed that synchronicity affects interactivity, and the results of the experiment supported their hypothesis. They observed that synchronous forms of communications allow for increased mental and behavioral engagement between parties, allowing participants to feel a stronger sense of connection, presence, identification, and social awareness in the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=Judee K.|last2=Chen|first2=Fang|last3=Twitchell|first3=Douglas P.|date=2010-07-01|title=Deception and its Detection Under Synchronous and Asynchronous Computer-Mediated Communication|journal=Group Decision and Negotiation|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=345–366|doi=10.1007/s10726-009-9168-8|issn=0926-2644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and applications==
Social information processing theory has been used to study online relationships in a variety of contexts. Since the late 1990s, the Internet has increased the amount of totally-mediated interactions making the possibility of developing and sustaining an entire relationships online more possible.

In relation to romantic relationships, several studies{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and subsequent theories have stemmed from SIP, combining it with theories such as Social Penetration Theory (SPT) or Relational Dialectics to further examine how modern day relationships are formed and sustained.  Scholars Nicole Ellison, Rebecca Heino, and Jennifer Gibbs conducted such a study and formed their own theory in their article Managing Impressions Online: Self-Presentation Processes in the Online Dating Environment which utilized both SIP and SPT to examine the development of modern relationships from online acquaintances to intimate partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00020.x | volume=11 | issue=2 | title=Managing Impressions Online: Self-Presentation Processes in the Online Dating Environment | journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication | pages=415–441 | last1 = Ellison | first1 = Nicole | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars James Farrer and Jeff Gavin from [[Sophia University]] in Japan examined the online dating process and dating relationship development to test the SIP theory. This study examines the experiences of past and present members of a popular Japanese online dating site in order to explore the extent to which Western-based theories of computer-mediated communication and the development of online relationships are relevant to the Japanese online dating experience. Specifically, their study examines whether social information processing theory is applicable to Japanese online dating interactions, and how and to what extent Japanese daters overcome the limitations of CMC through the use of contextual and other cues. Thirty-six current members and 27 former members of Match.com Japan completed an online survey. Using issue-based procedures for grounded theory analysis, they found strong support for SIP. Japanese online daters adapt their efforts to present and acquire social information using the cues that the online dating platform provides, although many of these cues are specific to Japanese social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farrer|first=James|last2=Gavin|first2=Jeff|title=Online Dating in Japan: A Test of Social Information Processing Theory|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=12|issue=4|pages=407–412|doi=10.1089/cpb.2009.0069|pmid=19630584|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, scholar Daria Heinemann analyzed the effects of SIP in the 1998 movie ''You've Got Mail'', and developed an activity to foster the teaching of SIP to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinemann|first=Daria|date=October 2011|title=Using You've Got Mail to Teach Social Information Processing Theory and Hyperpersonal Perspective in Online Interactions|url=|journal=Communication Teacher|volume=25|issue=4|pages=183–188|via=|doi=10.1080/17404622.2011.601720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application in online marketing ===
In [[business]] contexts, social information processing has been used to study virtual teams&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chudoba|first=Katherine|last2=Maznevski|first2=Martha|date=2000|title=Bridging Space over Time: Global Virtual Team Dynamics and Effectiveness|url=|journal=Organization Science|volume=11|issue=5|doi=10.1287/orsc.11.5.473.15200|pages=473–492|citeseerx=10.1.1.682.8612}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the ways [[Viral marketing|viral marketers]] influence the [[Diffusion of innovations|adoption of products]] and services through the Internet.&lt;ref name="Subramani"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Subramani|first=Mani R.|date=1 December 2003|title=Knowledge-sharing and influence in online social networks via viral marketing|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=46|issue=12|pages=300|doi=10.1145/953460.953514|author2=Rajagopalan, Balaji|title-link=social network|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.6186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mani R. Subramani and Balaji Rajagopalan&amp;nbsp;pay special attention to the SIP applied to real-world online marketing and promotion activities. The background which stimulate their academic interests is that online social networks are increasingly being recognized as an important source of information influencing the adoption and use of products and services.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2003/12/6627-knowledge-sharing-and-influence-in-online-social-networks-via-viral-marketing/fulltext|title=Knowledge-sharing and influence in online social networks via viral marketing {{!}} December 2003 {{!}} Communications of the ACM|last=Rajagopalan|first=Mani R Subramani, Balaji|website=cacm.acm.org|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the potential of viral marketing to efficiently reach out to a broad set of potential users is attracting considerable attention, the value of this approach is also being questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2000|title=How viral marketing can lead to virtual pestilence.|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/228111234|journal=Marketing Week|volume= 23|issue= 16|pages=17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social information-processing theory provides a useful lens to examine the interpersonal influence processes that are the hallmark of viral marketing since it views the social network as an important source of information and cues for behavior and action for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1996|title=Computer networks as social networks: Collaborative work, telework, and virtual community|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/199573392|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume= 22|issue= 1|pages=213–238|via=|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.213 | last1 = Wellman | first1 = Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior studies examining the diffusion of innovations and the transmission of ideas in social networks have viewed the interpersonal influence as occurring largely from face-to-face interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bansal|first=Harvir S.|last2=Voyer|first2=Peter A.|date=2000-11-01|title=Word-of-Mouth Processes within a Services Purchase Decision Context|url=http://jsr.sagepub.com/content/3/2/166|journal=Journal of Service Research|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|pages=166–177|doi=10.1177/109467050032005|issn=1094-6705}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, interpersonal influence in viral marketing occurs in computer-mediated settings and is significantly different from that occurring in conventional contexts in several ways.

There needs to be a greater understanding of the contexts in which this strategy works and the characteristics of products and services for which it is most effective. What is missing is an analysis of viral marketing that highlights systematic patterns in the nature of knowledge-sharing and persuasion by influencers and responses by recipients in online social networks. To this end, they propose an organizing framework for viral marketing that draws on prior theory and highlights different behavioral mechanisms underlying knowledge-sharing, influence, and compliance in online social networks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Application in online education ===
SIP has also been used to study learning in entirely online classes examining the ways that students develop relationships with the instructor and with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arbaugh|first=J. B.|date=2000-02-01|title=Virtual Classroom Characteristics and Student Satisfaction with Internet-Based MBA Courses|url=http://jme.sagepub.com/content/24/1/32|journal=Journal of Management Education|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=32–54|doi=10.1177/105256290002400104|issn=1052-5629}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dip Nandi, Margaret Hamilton, and James Harland from RMIT University did research on asynchronous discussion forums in fully [[E learning|online courses]]. Their study focuses on the online discussion process between the students and the instructors, as both senders and receivers, through the CMC channel with the asynchronous nature.

Fully online courses are becoming progressively more popular because of their "anytime anywhere" learning flexibility. One of the ways students interact with each other and with the instructors within fully online learning environments is via asynchronous discussion forums. However, student engagement in online discussion forums does not always take place automatically and there is a lack of clarity about the ideal role of the instructors in them. In their research, Dip Nandi and his colleges report on their research on the quality of discussion in fully online courses through analysis of discussion forum communication. They have conducted the research on two large fully online subjects for computing students over two consecutive semesters and used a grounded theoretic approach for data analysis. The results reveal what students and instructors consider as quality interaction in fully online courses. The researchers also propose two frameworks based on our findings that can be used to ensure effective online interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=May 2012|title=Evaluating the quality of interaction in asynchronous discussion forums in fully online courses|url=http://itecideas.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/58427910/Evaluating%20Quality%20of%20Interactions%20online.pdf|journal=Distance Education|volume=33|pages=5–30|via=|doi=10.1080/01587919.2012.667957 | last1 = Nandi | first1 = Dip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application in child development ===
Social information processing theory has also been used to examine the development of aggressive behavior in children in recent years. Theories of aggressive behavior and ethological observations in animals and children suggest the existence of distinct forms of reactive (hostile) and proactive (instrumental) aggression. Toward the validation of this distinction, groups of reactive aggressive, proactive aggressive, and nonaggressive children were identified. Social information-processing patterns were assessed in these groups by presenting hypothetical vignettes to subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crick|first=Nicki R.|last2=Dodge|first2=Kenneth A.|date=1996-01-01|title=Social Information-Processing Mechanisms in Reactive and Proactive Aggression|jstor=1131875|journal=Child Development|volume=67|issue=3|pages=993–1002|doi=10.2307/1131875|pmid=8706540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth A. Dodge and Nicki R. Crick from Vanderbilt University did research on the social information bases of aggressive behavior in children. In their study, the ways that basic theories and findings in cognitive and social psychology (including attribution, decision-making, and information-processing theories) have been applied to the study of aggressive behavior problems in children are described. Following an overview of each of these theories, a social information-processing model of children's aggressive behavior is outlined. According to this model, a child's behavioral response to a problematic social stimulus is a function of&amp;nbsp;five:&amp;nbsp;steps of processing: encoding of social cues, interpretation of social cues, response search, response evaluation, and enactment. Skillful processing at each step is hypothesized to lead to competent performance within a situation, whereas biased or deficient processing is hypothesized to lead to deviant social behavior Empirical studies are described in which children's patterns of processing have been found to predict individual differences in their aggressive behavior The implications of this body of work for empirically based interventions aimed at reducing children's aggressive behavior are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodge|first=Kenneth A.|last2=Crick|first2=Nicki R.|date=1990-03-01|title=Social Information-Processing Bases of Aggressive Behavior in Children|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/16/1/8|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=8–22|doi=10.1177/0146167290161002|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic integration==
While the theory revolves around the basis of interpersonal interaction from a socio-psychological perspective, communication scholars and academics use a positivistic (or empirical) approach to knowing in their study of SIP theory, meaning they rely heavily on numbers and data sets when striving to reach conclusions.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing communication theory : analysis and application|last=L.|first=West, Richard|others=Turner, Lynn H.|isbn=9780073534282|edition=Fifth|location=New York, NY|oclc=844725577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Despite the fact that social information processing theory offers a more [[optimistic]] perspective through which to perceive of and analyze online interactions, the theory is not without its criticisms. Even though Walther&lt;ref name=Walther92 /&gt; proposed that users of [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) have the same interpersonal needs met as those communicating face-to-face (FtF), he proposed that the lack of [[visual cues]] inherent in CMC are disadvantages to be overcome over time.&lt;ref name="walther"&gt;Walther, J. B., &amp; Parks, M. (2002). Cues filtered out, cues filtered in. ''Handbook of interpersonal communication''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, more time is needed for interactants to get to know one another, although he maintains that the same intimacy can be reached, just over a longer amount of time.&lt;ref name="Walther92" /&gt; In their research on social cues and impression formation in CMC, Martin Tanis and Tom Postmes found that when initial impressions in CMC are negative, it is questionable and not guaranteed that people will pursue future interaction which negates the idea that more personal and positive relationships will develop over time in CMC relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanis|first=M.|title=Social Cues and Impression Formation in CMC|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1093/joc/53.4.676|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=53|issue=4|pages=676–693|doi=10.1093/joc/53.4.676|year=2003|citeseerx=10.1.1.1011.7768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Walther's initial hypotheses relied on the assumption that positive social behaviors would be greater in face-to-face interactions than those in CMC. In a 1995 study, Walther used this hypothesis but added that any initial differences in socialness between the two media would disappear in time.&lt;ref name="joinson"&gt;Joinson, Adam. (2003). Understanding the psychology of Internet behavior. Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Walther was surprised to find that his results turned out to be contrary to this prediction. The results showed that, regardless of time-scale, CMC groups were rated higher in most measures of relational communication than those participating in the FtF condition.&lt;ref name="joinson" /&gt;

Robert Tokunaga has presented a cultural value flaw in the SIP theory.  An additional support for this claim is that there is research on [[intercultural communication]] that suggests the amount of exchange of self-disclosures in CMC is shaped by [[cultural values]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tokunaga|first=Robert|title=High-Speed Internet Access to the Other: The Influence of Cultural Orientations on Self-Disclosures in Offline and Online Relationships|journal=Journal of Intercultural Communication Research|year=2009|volume=38|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Tokunaga's study found that individualistic cultural values were able to fit inside the SIP theory while collectivist cultural values did not.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some originally argued that the scope of SIP Theory was too broad, since the realm of CMC is so expansive. However, the theory has evolved and been refined over years of research, and has developed more specificity within the discussions of online relationships, such as the topics of warranting and hyperpersonal perspectives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another area of SIP that has received some criticism relates to its testability. Walther has been a self-reflective critic of his own theory. First, Walther acknowledges that SIP has not fully acknowledged nor clarified the role of the issue of time in CMC relationships. Second, in discussing the hyperpersonal perspective, Walther admits that not all of the theoretical components of his hyperpersonal approach have been researched sufficiently. Third, in examining the warranting hypothesis, Walther, Brandon Van Der Heide, Lauren Hamel, &amp; Hillary Shulman accept the fact that high warranting value may exist on those matters that have strong social desirability. For example, physical attractiveness is a highly desirable trait in the United States, making it socially desirable. So, as Walther accepts, online communicators would seek corroboration for those qualities that society deems important or desirable. Whether or not other less socially desirable qualities are prone to warranting overtures is not fully explained.

To summarize, social information processing theory arrived in the communication discipline at the time that the rest of the research world was starting to examine the Internet for its possible influence on interpersonal communication and human relationships. Thus, Joseph Walther is somewhat of a scholarly prophet, forecasting the importance of looking at online relationships in the early 1990s. Although a few criticisms emerge in SIP, people cannot ignore the fact that Walther's theory remains a pivotal framework to consider as we envision future relationship development in an uncertain technological time.

== New technologies ==

The label '[[social media]]' has been attached to a quickly growing number of Web sites whose content is primarily user-driven.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lerman, Kristina.&amp;nbsp;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7609980608492301139 "Social Information Processing"]. Google. Retrieved November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These communities are large-scale examples of SIP. Navigating the 'social' world of information online is largely a product of interpersonal connections online, and has prompted the creation of aggregating, or collaborative sources, to help assist collective groups of people sort through information. Learning about others through the concept of "seamless sharing" opens another word for SIP. Some computer tools that facilitate this process are:
* Authoring tools: e.g. blogs
* Collaboration tools: e.g. Wikipedia
* Tagging systems: Flicker
* Social networking: Facebook; Twitter; Instagram; SnapChat

The process of learning from and connecting with others has not changed, but is instead manifested on the Internet. There are many different opinions regarding the value of social media interactions. These resources allow for people to connect and develop relationships using methods alternative to the traditional FtF-exclusive past, thus, making CMC more prevalent amongst social media users.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''Suppire–Mamara languages''' form the northern branch of the [[Senufo languages|Senufo]] language family and are mainly spoken in [[Mali]]. They comprise five different languages, totalling approximately 750,000 speakers (Olson 1996). The Northern Senufo languages are separated from the Central Senufo languages by a small band of [[Mande languages|Mande]] speaking people (the [[Duun language|Duun]]). To the east and west, they are also bordered mainly by Mande languages like [[Bambara language|Bambara]] and [[Dioula language|Dioula]], and they have been influenced considerably by those languages in both [[vocabulary]] and [[grammar]] (Carlson 1994).

The Suppire–Mamara languages are: 
*[[Mamara language|Mamara]] (Minyanka, Mianka)
*[[Nanerige language|Nanerige]] (Nanergé)
*[[Supyire language|Supyire]] (Suppire)
*[[Sucite language|Sucite]] (Sicite, Sìcìté)
*[[Shempire language|Shempire]] (Syempire)

'''The Tartan Curtain''' is a term of reference to the change in status of the Scottish border with [[England]] in the event that Scotland becomes an independent sovereign state, as supported by the [[Scottish national party|Scottish National Party]].

The term Tartan Curtain has the negative connotations of the [[Iron Curtain]] which divided [[Europe]] during the [[Cold War]].

The constitutional consequences of a newly independent [[Scotland]] joining the [[European union|EU]] remain unclear, but if Scotland has to join the [[European Union|EU]] as a new member state it will not necessarily inherit the vetoes enjoyed by the rest of the [[UK|United Kingdom]].
Part of the issue relates to the [[Schengen treaty]], which allows free movement between [[European Union]] member states. The [[United Kingdom]] exercises an opt out from this treaty in order to maintain complete control over its own border.

The [[House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee]] report entitled "The foreign policy implications of and for a separate Scotland" contains the following quote as Written evidence from the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]:
"The impact of an independent Scotland joining Schengen, were it to wish or be obliged to do so, would be significant, creating a UK land border with the Schengen area for the first time (the Republic of Ireland is not a member of Schengen)."&lt;ref&gt;The House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee report, "[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/writev/643/643.pdf The foreign policy implications of and for a separate Scotland]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been used in parliament, the press and in public discussions associated with Scottish Independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/party-address-1-801002 Party Address, The Scotsman, Thursday 22 April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.reuters.com/uknews/2011/05/19/measuring-up-the-tartan-curtain/ Measuring up the Tartan curtain, Reuters]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo041125/debtext/41125-09.htm Hansard, 25 Nov 2004 : Column 258]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term itself could relate to an Independent [[Scotland]]'s physical [[Anglo-Scottish border|border]] with the rest of the [[UK]] as well as differences in the [[currency]] and membership of international organisations such as [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19993694 BBC News, SNP members asked to ditch party's anti-Nato policy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19997538 BBC News, Scottish independence: UK foreign policy 'may be put at short-term risk']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/george-osborne-independent-scots-could-lose-pound-8114017.html The Independent, George Osborne: independent Scots could lose pound]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9264">'''Theodor Larsson''' (1880&amp;ndash;1937) was a [[Swedes|Swedish]] songwriter and comedian.&lt;ref name="Larsson"&gt;[https://archive.is/iGey5 Theodor Larsson] ''atspace.cc''. Retrieved: July 29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Theodor Larsson.jpg|thumb|175px|Theodor Larsson]]
Larsson was born June 8, 1880 in Gylle parish near the town of [[Trelleborg]] in [[Skåne]]. He died June 30, 1937 in [[Mjölby]].  A Swedish ''bondkomiker'' (rustic comic) and lyricist, his professional name was '''Skånska Lasse''' (Skåning Lasse).  He worked as a cabinetmaker in [[Malmö]], then for a short time in Stockholm before moving to [[Östergötland]], where he found employment at a furniture factory in [[Mjölby]]. It was during his time there that Larsson embarked on his course as an entertainer.  He often performed in a long coat with a flowery vest while playing the accordion. Married twice, he was the father of eleven children, several of whom also became entertainers.&lt;ref name="Larsson"/&gt;

A prolific songwriter, Larsson developed a talent for writing lyrics about topical events.  He even found humor in technological advances as his protagonists grappled with electricity, radio and motorized transport. The song ''Motorcykeln'' (The Motorcycle) became a hit for the singer [[Ernst Rolf]] and was also recorded in [[United States|America]] by [[Olle i Skratthult]] and [[Ragnar Hasselgren]].&lt;ref name="Records 1990"&gt;''Ethnic Music on Records: A Discography of Ethnic Recordings Produced in the United States, 1893-1942'' by Richard K. Spottswood, (University of Illinois Press, 1990) LCCN 89-020526. Volume 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Another of his compositions, ''Josefin mä symaskin'' (Josephine with the sewing machine), crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in a version by Bert Leman.&lt;ref name="Records 1990"/&gt;

Skånska Lasse made many recordings himself. ''Sven Svenssons Sven'' — later recorded by the [[Swedish-American]] singers [[Olle i Skratthult]] and [[Charles G. Widdén]] — brought up the subject of [[temperance movement|temperance]] while ''De rysliga bolshevikerna'' (The terrible bolsheviks) was a sly piece of political satire.  The latter song was recorded in 2009 by the [[Swedes|Swedish]] actor [[Sven Wollter]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sånger från tjugonde seklet'' by Sven Wollter, (Göteborg: Proletärkultur, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one song above all others for which Lasse is remembered, ''Bonnjazz'' (Country dance), which he recorded in 1924. The song, one of the best-known works in [[Sweden|Swedish]] popular music, has gone by many names, including ''Jazz på landet'' (Dance in the country) and ''Johan på snippen'' (Johan on the snippet of land).  In [[United States|America]] it was recorded by [[Lydia Hedberg]] in 1925 and [[Olle i Skratthult]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="Records 1990"/&gt;

==Johan på snippen==
[[File:Skanska lasse.jpg|thumb|150px|Skånska Lasse]]
The song commonly known as ''Johan på snippen'' was first published in 1922.  It had music by Gaston René Wahlberg and words by Skånska Lasse (Theodor Larsson). The two men never met.&lt;ref name="Ericson 1971"&gt;''På Nöjets Estrader'' by Uno Myggan Ericson, (Stockholm: Bonnier, 1971) pp. 127 - 141.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Wahlberg, who was an engineer by profession, lived in [[Örebro]] in the province of [[Närke]].  When the iron industry flourished in the mining region of [[Bergslagen]], people would come to [[Örebro]] to do business at ''Hindersmässan'' [[Henry (Bishop of Finland)|(The St. Henry’s Fair)]], an annual event which has continued until the present day.  Wahlberg used to amuse himself on the piano, and one time after a visit to the local fair he set down some musical impressions.  The result was a schottische he called ''Hindersmässan''.&lt;ref name="Ericson 1971"/&gt; 
 
[[Ernst Rolf]] purchased the melody from Wahlberg and passed it on to Larsson, who then set about writing suitable lyrics.  ''Hindersmässan'' was the only melody that Wahlberg ever published, and over the years there has been some confusion about his name.  Some have thought the composer to be Gideon Wahlberg, a Swedish songwriter best known for the waltz ''Svinnsta skär''.  It was Walter Larsson, the lyricist’s son, who finally tracked down G. R. Wahlberg and saw to it that he received royalty payments for the composition.&lt;ref name="Ericson 1971"/&gt;

Near Skånska Lasse’s home was a cottage on a small plot of land.  He based ''Johan på snippen'' partly on the neighbor who lived there but also drew upon his knowledge of local customs and folk festivals, having written many such verses before.&lt;ref name="Ericson 1971"/&gt;

Wahlberg’s famous tune has inspired countless parodies, the most notable being ''Johan på snippens Ford'' (Johan på snippen’s Ford) with lyrics by Skånska Lasse and ''Johan på snibbens dammsugsmaskin'' (Johan på snibben’s vacuum cleaner) with lyrics by Erik Eriksson.  Both songs were recorded by Eric P:son Friberg in the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://78-varvare.atspace.cc/erifri.htm Erik P:son Friberg] ''atspace.cc''. Retrieved: April 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vowel harmony''' is a type of [[#"Long-distance"|long-distance]] [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilatory]] [[Phonology|phonological]] process involving [[vowels]] that occurs in some languages. A vowel or vowels in a word must be members of the same subclass (thus "in harmony"). In languages with vowel harmony, there are constraints on which vowels may be found near each other. Suffixes and prefixes will usually follow vowel harmony rules. Many [[agglutinative language]]s have vowel harmony.

==Terminology==
{{See also|Germanic umlaut|I-mutation|Metaphony}}
The term ''vowel harmony'' is used in two different senses.

In the first sense, it refers to any type of long distance assimilatory process of vowels, either ''progressive'' or ''regressive''. When used in this sense, the term ''vowel harmony'' is synonymous with the term ''[[metaphony]]''.

In the second sense, ''vowel harmony'' refers only to ''progressive'' vowel harmony (beginning-to-end). For ''regressive'' harmony, the term ''umlaut'' is used. In this sense, ''metaphony'' is the general term while ''vowel harmony'' and ''umlaut'' are both sub-types of metaphony. The term ''umlaut'' is also used in a different sense to refer to a type of [[vowel gradation]]. This article will use "vowel harmony" for both progressive and regressive harmony.

=="Long-distance"==

Harmony processes are "long-distance" in the sense that the assimilation involves sounds that are separated by intervening [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]s (usually consonant segments). In other words, ''harmony'' refers to the assimilation of sounds that are ''not'' adjacent to each other. For example, a vowel at the beginning of a word can trigger assimilation in a vowel at the end of a word. The assimilation occurs across the entire word in many languages. This is represented schematically in the following diagram:

:{| cellspacing="5" style="font-size: 110%;"
! &lt;span style="line-height: 1.2em;"&gt;before&lt;br&gt;assimilation&lt;/span&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
! &lt;span style="line-height: 1.2em;"&gt;after&lt;br&gt;assimilation&lt;/span&gt;
|
|-
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;C&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;''V&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;C&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;''V&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;C
| '''→'''
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;/span&gt;C&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;''V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;C&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;''V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;C
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;(&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; = type-a vowel, &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; = type-b vowel, C = consonant)&lt;/small&gt;
|}

In the diagram above, the &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (type-a vowel) causes the following &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (type-b vowel) to assimilate and become the same type of vowel (and thus they become, metaphorically, "in harmony").

The vowel that causes the vowel assimilation is frequently termed the ''trigger'' while the vowels that assimilate (or ''harmonize'') are termed ''targets''. When the vowel triggers lie within the [[root (linguistics)|root]] or [[word stem|stem]] of a word and the [[affix]]es contain the targets, this is called ''stem-controlled'' vowel harmony (the opposite situation is called ''dominant'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|van der Hulst|van de Weijer|1995|p=496}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is fairly common among languages with vowel harmony{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} and may be seen in the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] [[dative case|dative]] suffix:

:{| cellspacing="5"
! Root
! Dative
! Gloss
|-
| {{lang|hu|város}}
| {{lang|hu|város'''-nak'''}}
| 'city'
|-
| {{lang|hu|öröm}}
| {{lang|hu|öröm'''-nek'''}}
| 'joy'
|}

The dative suffix has two different forms {{lang|hu|-nak/-nek}}. The {{lang|hu|-nak}} form appears after the root with back vowels ({{lang|hu|o}} and {{lang|hu|a}} are back vowels). The {{lang|hu|-nek}} form appears after the root with front vowels ({{lang|hu|ö}} and {{lang|hu|e}} are front vowels).

==Features of vowel harmony==

Vowel harmony often involves dimensions such as

* [[Vowel height]] &amp;nbsp; (i.e. high, mid, or low vowels)
* [[Vowel backness]] &amp;nbsp; (i.e. front, central, or back vowels)
* [[Vowel roundedness]] &amp;nbsp; (i.e. rounded or unrounded)
* [[Retracted tongue root|Tongue root position]] &amp;nbsp; (i.e. advanced or retracted tongue root, abbrev.: ±ATR)
* [[Nasalization]] &amp;nbsp; (i.e. oral or nasal) ''(in this case, a [[nasal consonant]] is usually the trigger)''

In many languages, vowels can be said to belong to particular sets or classes, such as back vowels or rounded vowels. Some languages have more than one system of harmony. For instance, [[Altaic languages]] are proposed to have a rounding harmony superimposed over a backness harmony.

Even among languages with vowel harmony, not all vowels need to participate in the vowel conversions; these vowels are termed ''neutral''. Neutral vowels may be ''opaque'' and block harmonic processes or they may be ''transparent'' and not affect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|van der Hulst|van de Weijer|1995|pp=496–498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intervening consonants are also often transparent.

Finally, languages that do have vowel harmony often allow for lexical ''disharmony'', or words with mixed sets of vowels even when an opaque neutral vowel is not involved. {{Harvcoltxt|van der Hulst|van de Weijer|1995}} point to two such situations: polysyllabic trigger morphemes may contain non-neutral vowels from opposite harmonic sets and certain target morphemes simply fail to harmonize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|van der Hulst|van de Weijer|1995|pp=499–500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[loanword]]s exhibit disharmony. For example, Turkish {{lang|tr|vakit}}, ('time' [from Arabic {{transl|ar|waqt}}]); *{{lang|tr|vak'''ı'''t}} would have been expected.

There are three classes of vowels in [[Korean language|Korean]]: positive, negative, and neutral. These categories loosely follow the front (positive) and mid (negative) vowels. Traditionally, Korean had strong vowel harmony; however, this rule is no longer observed strictly in modern Korean. In modern Korean, it is only applied in certain cases such as [[onomatopoeia]], [[adjectives]], [[adverbs]], [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]], and [[interjection]]s. The vowel {{lang|ko|ㅡ}} ({{transl|ko|eu}}) is considered a partially neutral and a partially negative vowel. There are other traces of vowel harmony in modern Korean: many native Korean words tend to follow vowel harmony such as {{lang|ko|사람}} ({{transl|ko|saram}}, 'person'), and {{lang|ko|부엌}} ({{transl|ko|bu-eok}}, 'kitchen').

[[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] exhibits both a pharyngeal harmony and a rounding harmony. In particular, the pharyngeal harmony involves the vowels: {{IPA|/a, ʊ, ɔ/}} (pharyngeal) and {{IPA|/i, u, e, o/}} (non-pharyngeal). Rounding harmony only affects the open vowels, {{IPA|/e, o, a, ɔ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Svantesson |first=Jan-Olof |author2=Anna Tsendina |author3=Anastasia Karlsson |author4=Vivan Franzen |publisher=Oxford University Press |title=The Phonology of Mongolian |series=The Phonology of the World's Languages |year=2005 |isbn=9780199260171}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2016}}

Turkic languages inherit their systems of vowel harmony from [[Proto-Turkic]], which already had a fully developed system.

[[Tatar language|Tatar]] has no neutral vowels. The vowel é is found only in [[loanword]]s. Other vowels also could be found in loanwords, but they are seen as Back vowels. Tatar language also has a rounding harmony, but it is not represented in writing. O and ö could be written only in the first syllable, but vowels they mark could be pronounced in the place where ı and e are written.

[[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]'s system of vowel harmony is primarily a front/back system, but there is also a system of rounding harmony that is not represented by the orthography, which strongly resembles the system in Kyrgyz.

[[Turkish language|Turkish]] has a 2-dimensional vowel harmony system, where vowels are characterised by two features: [±front] and [±rounded]. There are two sets of vocal harmony systems: a simple one and a complex one. The simple one is concerned with the '''low vowels e, a''' and has only the [±front] feature (''e'' front vs ''a'' back). The complex one is concerned with the '''high vowels i, ü, ı, u''' and has both [±front] and [±rounded] features (''i'' front unrounded vs ''ü'' front rounded and ''ı'' back unrounded vs ''u'' back rounded). The close-mid vowels ''ö, o'' are not involved in vowel harmony processes.

=====Front/back harmony=====
[[Turkish language|Turkish]] has two classes of vowels{{spaced ndash}}''front'' and ''back''. Vowel harmony states that words may not contain both front and back vowels. Therefore, most grammatical suffixes come in front and back forms, e.g. ''Türkiye''''de''''' "in Turkey" but ''Almanya''''da''''' "in Germany".

|}

=====Rounding harmony=====
In addition, there is a secondary rule that ''i'' and ''ı'' in suffixes tend to become ''ü'' and ''u'' respectively after rounded vowels, so certain suffixes have additional forms. This gives constructions such as ''Türkiye''''dir''''' "it is Turkey", ''kapı'''dır''''' "it is the door", but ''gün'''dür''''' "it is day", ''palto'''dur''''' "it is the coat".

=====Exceptions=====
Not all suffixes obey vowel harmony perfectly.

In the suffix ''-(i)yor'', the ''o'' is invariant, while the ''i'' changes according to the preceding vowel; for example ''sön'''ü'''y'''o'''r'' – "he/she/it fades". Likewise, in the suffix ''-(y)ken'',  the ''e'' is invariant: ''Roma'dayk'''e'''n'' – "When in Rome"; and so is the ''i'' in the suffix ''-(y)ebil'': ''inanıl'''a'''b'''i'''lir'' – "credible". The suffix ''-ki'' exhibits partial harmony, never taking a back vowel but allowing only the front-voweled variant ''-kü'': ''dünk'''ü''''' – "belonging to yesterday"; ''yarınk'''i''''' – "belonging to tomorrow".

The suffix ''-(y)le'' follows vowel harmony. However, in the phonology, it [[I-mutation|front]]s a preceding back vowel ''ı'', thus creating a violation of the harmony. So the word ''dolayısıyla'' ("therefore"), formed from ''dolayısı'' with the variant suffix ''-yla'', which has a back vowel ''a'' according to vowel harmony, is actually pronounced as if the word is written *''dolayıs'''i'''yla''.

Most Turkish words do not only have vowel harmony for suffixes, but also internally. However, there are many exceptions.

Compound words are considered separate words with respect to vowel harmony: vowels do not have to harmonize between members of the compound (thus forms like {{italics correction|''bu''}}|''gün'' "this|day" = "today" are permissible). Vowel harmony does not apply for [[loanword]]s, as in ''otobüs'' – from French "autobus". There are also a few native modern Turkish words that do not follow the rule (such as ''anne'' "mother" or ''kardeş'' "sibling" which used to obey vowel harmony in their older forms, ''ana'' and ''karındaş'', respectively). However, in such words, suffixes nevertheless harmonize with the final vowel; thus ''annes'''i''''' – "his/her mother", and ''voleybolc'''u''''' – "volleyball player".

In some loanwords the final vowel is an ''a'', ''o'' or ''u'' and thus looks like a back vowel, but is phonetically actually a front vowel, and governs vowel harmony accordingly. An example is the word ''saat'', meaning "hour" or "clock", a loanword from Arabic. Its plural is ''sa'''a'''tl'''e'''r''. This is not truly an exception to vowel harmony itself; rather, it is an exception to the rule that ''a'' denotes a front vowel.

Disharmony tends to disappear through analogy, especially within loanwords; e.g. ''Hüsnü'' (a man's name) &lt; earlier ''Hüsni'', from Arabic ''husnî''; ''Müslüman'' "Moslem, Muslim (adj. and n.)" &lt; Ottoman Turkish ''müslimân'', from Persian ''mosalmân'').

===Uralic languages===
Many, though not all, Uralic languages show vowel harmony between front and back vowels. Vowel harmony is often hypothesized to have existed in [[Proto-Uralic]], though its original scope remains a matter of discussion.

====Samoyedic====
Vowel harmony is found in [[Nganasan language|Nganasan]] and is reconstructed also for [[Proto-Samoyedic]].

====Hungarian====

[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], like its distant relative Finnish, has the same system of ''front'', ''back'', and ''intermediate'' (neutral) vowels but is more complex than the one in Finnish, and some vowel harmony processes. The basic rule is that words including at least one back vowel get back vowel suffixes (''kar'''ba''''' – in(to) the arm), while words excluding back vowels get front vowel suffixes (''kéz'''be''''' – in(to) the hand). One vowel words including only the neutral vowels ''i'', ''í'' or ''é'' are unpredictable (not in case of ''e'' which surely gets front vowel suffix).

One essential difference in classification between Hungarian and Finnish is that standard Hungarian (along with 3 out of 10 local dialects) does not observe the difference between Finnish 'ä' {{IPA|[æ]}} and 'e' {{IPA|[e]}}{{spaced ndash}}the Hungarian front vowel 'e' {{IPA|[ɛ]}} is closely pronounced as the Finnish front vowel 'ä' {{IPA|[æ]}}. 7 out of the 10 local dialects have the vowel ë {{IPA|[e]}} which has never been part of the Hungarian alphabet, and thus is not used in practice.

=====Behaviour of neutral vowels=====

|-
|}
''Unrounded front vowels'' (or ''Intermediate'' or ''neutral'' vowels) can occur together with either ''back vowels'' (e.g. ''r'''é'''p'''a''''' carrot, ''k'''o'''cs'''i''''' car) or ''rounded front vowels'' (e.g. ''tető'', ''tündér''), but ''rounded front vowels'' and ''back vowels'' can occur together only in words of foreign origins (e.g. ''sofőr'' = chauffeur, French word for driver). The basic rule is that words including at least one back vowel take back vowel suffixes (e.g. ''répá|ban'' in a carrot, ''kocsi|ban'' in a car), while words excluding back vowels usually take front vowel suffixes (except for words including only the vowels ''i'' or ''í'', for which there is no general rule, e.g. ''liszt|et'', ''hid|at'').

Some other rules and guidelines to consider:
* Compound words get suffix according to the last word, e.g.: ''ártér'' (floodplain) compound of ''ár'' + ''tér'' gets front vowel suffix just as the word ''tér'' when stands alone (''tér|en'', ''ártér|en'')
* In case of words of obvious foreign origins: only the last vowel counts (if it is not ''i'' or ''í''): ''sof'''ő'''r|h'''ö'''z, nü'''a'''nsz|sz'''a'''l, gener'''á'''l|'''á'''s, októb'''e'''r|b'''e'''n, parlam'''e'''nt|b'''e'''n, szoftv'''e'''r|r'''e'''l''
** If the last vowel of the foreign word is ''i'' or ''í'', then the last but one vowel will be taken into consideration, e.g. ''p'''a'''pír|h'''o'''z'', ''R'''a'''shid|d'''a'''l''. If the foreign word includes only the vowels ''i'' or ''í'' then it gets front vowel suffix, e.g.: ''Mitch-nek'' ( = ''for Mitch'')
** There are some non-Hungarian geographical names that have no vowels at all (e.g. the Croatian island of ''Krk''), in which case as the word does not include back vowel, it gets front vowel suffix (e.g. ''Krk-re'' = to Krk)
* For acronyms: the last vowel counts (just as in case of foreign words), e.g.: ''HR'' (pronounced: ''há-er'') gets front vowel suffix as the last pronounced vowel is front vowel (''HR-rel'' = with HR)
* Some 1-syllable Hungarian words with '''i''', '''í''' or '''é''' are strictly using front suffixes (''g'''é'''p|r'''e''', m'''é'''ly|r'''ő'''l, v'''í'''z'' &gt; ''v'''i'''z|'''e'''t'', ''h'''í'''r|'''e'''k''), while some others can take back suffixes only (''h'''é'''j|'''a'''k, sz'''í'''j|r'''ó'''l'', ''ny'''í'''l'' &gt; ''ny'''i'''l|'''a'''t'', ''zs'''í'''r|b'''a'''n'', '''''í'''r|'''á'''s'')
* Some foreign words that have fit to the Hungarian language and start with back vowel and end with front vowel can take either front or back suffixes (so can be optionally considered foreign word or Hungarian word): ''f'''a'''rmer|b'''a'''n'' or ''farm'''e'''r|b'''e'''n''

=====Suffixes with multiple forms=====
Grammatical suffixes in Hungarian can have one, two, three, or four forms:
* ''one form'': every word gets the same suffix regardless of the included vowels (e.g. ''-kor'')
* ''two forms'' (most common): words get either back vowel or front vowel suffix (as mentioned above) (e.g. ''-ban/-ben'')
* ''three forms'': there is one back vowel form and two front vowel forms; one for words of which last vowel is rounded front vowel and one for words of which last vowel is not rounded front vowel (e.g. ''-hoz/-hez/-höz'')
* ''four forms'': there are two back vowel forms and two front vowel forms (e.g. -''ot/-at/-et/-öt'' or simply ''-t'', if the last sound is a vowel)

====Mansi====
Vowel harmony occurred in [[Southern Mansi]].

====Khanty====
In the [[Khanty language]], vowel harmony occurs in the Eastern dialects, and affects both inflectional and derivational suffixes. The Vakh-Vasyugan dialect has a particularly extensive system of vowel harmony, with seven different front-back pairs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eastern Ostyak chrestomathy|first=János|last=Gulya|year=1966|series=Indiana University Publications, Uralic and Altaic series|volume=51|pp=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
! Back
| {{IPA|/ɑ/}} || {{IPA|/o/}} || {{IPA|/u/}} || {{IPA|/ɯ/}} || {{IPA|/ʌ/}} || {{IPA|/ʊ/}}
|}

The vowels {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/œ/}} (front) and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} (back) can only occur in the first syllable of a word, and do not actively participate in vowel harmony, but they do trigger it.

Vowel harmony is lost in the Northern and Southern dialects, as well as in the Surgut dialect of Eastern Khanty.

====Mari====
Most varieties of the [[Mari language]] have vowel harmony.

====Erzya====
The [[Erzya language]] has a limited system of vowel harmony, involving only two vowel phonemes: {{IPA|/e/}} (front) versus {{IPA|/o/}} (back).

[[Moksha language|Moksha]], the closest relative of Erzya, has no phonemic vowel harmony, though {{IPA|/ə/}} has front and back [[allophone]]s in a distribution similar to the vowel harmony in Erzya.

====Finnic languages====
Vowel harmony is found in most of the [[Finnic languages]]. It has been lost in [[Livonian language|Livonian]] and in Standard [[Estonian language|Estonian]], where the front vowels ''ü'' ''ä'' ''ö'' occur only in the first (stressed) syllable. [[Võro language|Võro]], a dialect of [[South Estonian language|South Estonian]], however retains vowel harmony.

=====Finnish=====
[[File:Finnish vowel harmony Venn diagram.svg|thumb|A diagram illustrating vowel harmony in Finnish.]]
[[File:Finnish vowel harmony.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Finnish vowel harmony and case agreement exemplified by ''mahdollisissa yllättävissä tilanteissa'' ("in possible unexpected situations"): ''mahdollinen'' takes ''-ssa'', ''yllättävä'' takes ''-ssä'' and ''tilanne'', with a neutral vowel first but a back vowel second, takes ''-ssa''.]]

In the [[Finnish language]], there are three classes of vowels{{spaced ndash}}''front'', ''back'', and ''neutral'', where each front vowel has a back vowel pairing. Grammatical endings such as case and derivational endings{{spaced ndash}}but not [[enclitic]]s{{spaced ndash}}have only archiphonemic vowels U, O, A, which are realized as either back {{IPA|[u, o, ɑ]}} or front {{IPA|[y, ø, æ]}} inside a single word. From vowel harmony it follows that the initial syllable of each single (non-compound) word controls the frontness or backness of the entire word. Non-initially, the neutral vowels are transparent to and unaffected by vowel harmony. In the initial syllable:
# a back vowel causes all non-initial syllables to be realized with back (or neutral) vowels, e.g. ''pos+ahta+(t)a'' → ''posahtaa''
# a front vowel causes all non-initial syllables to be realized with front (or neutral) vowels, e.g. ''räj+ahta+(t)a'' → ''räjähtää''.
# a neutral vowel acts like a front vowel, but does not control the frontness or backness of the word: if there are back vowels in non-initial syllables, the word acts like it began with back vowels, even if they come from derivational endings, e.g. ''sih+ahta+(t)a'' → ''sihahtaa'' cf. ''sih+ise+(t)a'' → ''sihistä''

For example:
* ''kaura'' begins with back vowel → ''kauralla''
* ''kuori'' begins with back vowel → ''kuorella''
* ''sieni'' begins without back vowels → ''sienellä'' (not *''sienella'')
* ''käyrä'' begins without back vowels → ''käyrällä''
* ''tuote'' begins with back vowels → ''tuotteessa''
* ''kerä'' begins with a neutral vowel → ''kerällä''
* ''kera'' begins with a neutral vowel, but has a noninitial back vowel → ''keralla''

Some dialects that have a sound change opening diphthong codas also permit archiphonemic vowels in the initial syllable. For example, standard 'ie' is reflected as 'ia' or 'iä', controlled by noninitial syllables, in the Tampere dialect, e.g. ''tiä'' ← ''tie'' but ''miakka'' ← ''miekka''.

... as evidenced by ''tuotteessa'' (not *''tuotteessä''). Even if [[phonology|phonologically]] front vowels precede the suffix ''-nsa'', grammatically it is preceded by a word controlled by a back vowel. As shown in the examples, neutral vowels make the system unsymmetrical, as they are front vowels phonologically, but leave the front/back control to any grammatical front or back vowels. There is little or no change in the actual vowel quality of the neutral vowels.

As a consequence, Finnish speakers often have problems with pronouncing foreign words which do not obey vowel harmony. For example, ''olympia'' is often pronounced ''olumpia''. The position of some loans is unstandardized (e.g. ''chattailla''/''chättäillä'' ) or ill-standardized (e.g. ''polymeeri'', sometimes pronounced ''polumeeri'', and ''autoritäärinen'', which violate vowel harmony). Where a foreign word violates vowel harmony by not using front vowels because it begins with a neutral vowel, then last syllable generally counts, although this rule is irregularly followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ringen | first1 = Catherine O. | last2 = Heinämäki | first2 = Orvokki | title = Variation in Finnish Vowel Harmony: An OT Account | url = | journal = Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory | volume = 17 | issue = 2| year = 1999 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006158818498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments indicate that e.g. ''miljonääri'' always becomes (front) ''miljonääriä'', but ''marttyyri'' becomes equally frequently both ''marttyyria'' (back) and ''marttyyriä'' (front), even by the same speaker.

With respect to vowel harmony, compound words can be considered separate words. For example, ''syyskuu'' ("autumn month" i.e. September) has both ''u'' and ''y'', but it consists of two words ''syys'' and ''kuu'', and declines ''syys·kuu·ta'' (not *''syyskuutä''). The same goes for enclitics, e.g. ''taaksepäin'' "backwards" consists of the word ''taakse'' "to back" and ''-päin'' "-wards", which gives e.g. ''taaksepäinkään'' (not *''taaksepäinkaan'' or *''taaksepainkaan''). If fusion takes place, the vowel is harmonized by some speakers, e.g. ''tälläinen'' pro ''tällainen'' ← ''tämän lainen''.

Some Finnish words whose stems contain only neutral vowels exhibit an alternating pattern in terms of vowel harmony when inflected or forming new words through derivation. Examples include ''meri'' "sea", ''meressä'' "in the sea" ([[inessive]]), but ''merta'' ([[partitive]]), not *''mertä''; ''veri'' "blood", ''verestä'' "from the blood" ([[elative case|elative]]), but ''verta'' (partitive), not *''vertä''; ''pelätä'' "to be afraid", but ''pelko'' "fear", not *''pelkö''; ''kipu'' "pain", but ''kipeä'' "sore", not *''kipea''.

[[Helsinki slang]] has slang words that have roots violating vowel harmony, e.g. ''Sörkka''. This can be interpreted as Swedish influence.

===Yokuts===

Vowel harmony is present in all [[Yokutsan languages]] and dialects. For instance, [[Yawelmani language|Yawelmani]] has 4 vowels (which additionally may be either [[Vowel length|long]] or short). These can be grouped as in the table below.

{| align="right" class="wikitable" style="margin-left: 1em"
|-
! || Unrounded || Rounded
|-
! High
| {{IPA|i}} || {{IPA|u}}
|-
! Low
| {{IPA|a}} || {{IPA|ɔ}}
|-
|}

Vowels in suffixes must harmonize with either {{IPA|/u/}} or its non-{{IPA|/u/}} counterparts or with {{IPA|/ɔ/}} or non-{{IPA|/ɔ/}} counterparts. For example, the vowel in the [[aorist]] suffix appears as {{IPA|/u/}} when it follows a {{IPA|/u/}} in the root, but when it follows all other vowels it appears as {{IPA|/i/}}. Similarly, the vowel in the nondirective gerundial suffix appears as {{IPA|/ɔ/}} when it follows a {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in the root; otherwise it appears as {{IPA|/a/}}.

{|
| ''-hun''/''-hin'' || &amp;nbsp; || (aorist suffix)
|-
| ''muṭhun'' || {{IPA|[muʈhun]}} || 'swear (aorist)'
|-
| ''giy̓hin'' || {{IPA|[ɡijˀhin]}} || 'touch (aorist)'
|-
| ''gophin'' || {{IPA|[ɡɔphin]}} || 'take of infant (aorist)'
|-
| ''xathin'' || {{IPA|[xathin]}} || 'eat (aorist)'
|-
| ''-tow''/''-taw'' || &amp;nbsp; || (nondirective gerundial suffix)
|-
| ''goptow'' || {{IPA|[ɡɔptɔw]}} || 'take care of infant (nondir. ger.)'
|-
| ''giy̓taw'' || {{IPA|[ɡijˀtaw]}} || 'touch (nondir. ger.)'
|-
| ''muṭtaw'' || {{IPA|[muʈtaw]}} || 'swear (nondir. ger.)'
|-
| ''xattaw'' || {{IPA|[xatːaw]}} || 'eat (nondir. ger.)'
|}

In addition to the harmony found in suffixes, there is a harmony restriction on word stems where in stems with more than one syllable all vowels are required to be of the same lip rounding and tongue height dimensions. For example, a stem must contain all high rounded vowels or all low rounded vowels, etc. This restriction is further complicated by (i) long high vowels being lowered and (ii) an [[epenthetic vowel]] {{IPA|[i]}} which does not harmonize with stem vowels.

===Sumerian===
There is some evidence for vowel harmony according to [[vowel height]] or [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] in the prefix i&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/e- in  inscriptions from pre-[[Sargon the Great|Sargonic]] [[Lagash]] (the specifics of the pattern have led a handful of scholars to postulate not only an {{IPA|/o/}} phoneme, but even an {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and, most recently, an {{IPA|/ɔ/}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Smith| first=Eric J M| year=2007| title=Harmony and the Vowel Inventory of Sumerian| journal=Journal of Cuneiform Studies| volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cases of partial or complete [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of the vowel of certain prefixes and suffixes to one in the adjacent syllable are reflected in writing in some of the later periods, and there is a noticeable though not absolute tendency for disyllabic stems to have the same vowel in both syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author1-last=Michalowski| author1-first=Piotr| year=2008| chapter=Sumerian| editor1-last=Woodard| editor1-first=Roger D| title=The Ancient Languages of Mesopotamia, Egypt and Aksum| publisher=Cambridge University Press| page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; What appears to be [[Contraction (phonology)|vowel contraction]] in [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] (*/aa/, */ia/, */ua/ &gt; a, */ae/ &gt; a, */ue/ &gt; u, etc.) is also very common.

==Other types of harmony==

Although vowel harmony is the most well-known harmony, not all types of harmony that occur in the world's languages involve only vowels. Other types of harmony involve consonants (and is known as [[consonant harmony]]). Rarer types of harmony are those that involve [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] or both vowels and consonants (e.g. ''postvelar harmony'').

===Vowel-consonant harmony===

Some languages have harmony processes that involve an interaction between vowels and consonants. For example, [[Chilcotin language|Chilcotin]] has a phonological process known as ''vowel flattening'' (i.e. post-velar harmony) where vowels must harmonize with [[uvular]] and [[pharyngealisation|pharyngealized]] consonants.

Chilcotin has two classes of vowels:

* "flat" vowels {{IPA|[ᵊi, e, ᵊɪ, o, ɔ, ə, a]}}
* non-"flat" vowels {{IPA|[i, ɪ, u, ʊ, æ, ɛ]}}

Additionally, Chilcotin has a class of pharyngealized "flat" consonants {{IPA|[tsˤ, tsʰˤ, tsʼˤ, sˤ, zˤ]}}. Whenever a consonant of this class occurs in a word, all preceding vowels must be flat vowels.

{| style="margin-left: 1em;"
| {{IPA|[jətʰeɬtsˤʰosˤ]}} || 'he's holding it (fabric)'
|-
| {{IPA|[ʔapələsˤ]}} || 'apples'
|-
| {{IPA|[natʰákʼə̃sˤ]}} || 'he'll stretch himself'
|}

If flat consonants do not occur in a word, then all vowels will be of the non-flat class:

{| style="margin-left: 1em;"
| {{IPA|[nænɛntʰǽsʊç]}} || 'I'll comb hair'
|-
| {{IPA|[tetʰǽskʼɛn]}} || 'I'll burn it'
|-
| {{IPA|[tʰɛtɬʊç]}} || 'he laughs'
|}

Other languages of this region of North America (the Plateau culture area), such as [[St'at'imcets language#Phonological processes|St'át'imcets]], have similar vowel-consonant harmonic processes.

===Syllabic synharmony===
Syllabic synharmony was a process in the [[Proto-Slavic language]] ancestral to all modern [[Slavic languages]]. It refers to the tendency of frontness (palatality) to be generalised across an entire syllable. It was therefore a form of consonant–vowel harmony in which the property 'palatal' or 'non-palatal' applied to an entire syllable at once rather than to each sound individually.

The result was that back vowels were fronted after ''j'' or a palatal consonant, and consonants were palatalised before ''j'' or a front vowel. Diphthongs were harmonized as well, although they were soon monophthongized because of a tendency to end syllables with a vowel (syllables were or became open). This rule remained in place for a long time, and ensured that a syllable containing a front vowel always began with a palatal consonant, and a syllable containing ''j'' was always preceded by a palatal consonant and followed by a front vowel.

A similar process occurs in [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]], where palatalization of consonants and fronting of vowels is a [[Skolt Sami language#Suprasegmentals|suprasegmental]] process applying to a whole syllable. Suprasegmental palatalization is marked with the letter ''ʹ'', which is a freestanding [[acute accent]], for example in the word ''vääʹrr'' 'mountain, hill'.

The '''Xhosa Wikipedia''' is the [[Xhosa language]] edition of [[Wikipedia]]. It has {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|xh|N}} articles, which as of 25 August 2018 makes it the 260th largest Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xhosa edition of Wikipedia was started in June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaXH.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Its low number of articles has led to proposals to close it in 2008&lt;ref&gt;[https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects/Closure_of_Xhosa_Wikipedia Proposals for closing projects/Closure of Xhosa Wikipedia]&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013&lt;ref&gt;[https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proposals_for_closing_projects/Closure_of_Xhosa_Wikipedia_2 Proposals for closing projects/Closure of Xhosa Wikipedia 2]&lt;/ref&gt; (both rejected).

As Xhosa is mutually intelligible with [[Zulu language|Zulu]], both of which are [[Nguni languages]], it is possible for articles in the [[Zulu Wikipedia|Zulu edition]] to be easily translated into Xhosa for the Xhosa Wikipedia. Similar trans-wiki efforts have been made for [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian-language]] editions, such as the [[Swedish Wikipedia|Swedish]], [[Norwegian Wikipedia|Norwegian]], and [[Danish Wikipedia|Danish]] through [[Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia]]'s ''[[meta:Skanwiki|Skanwiki]]'' collaboration tool.
