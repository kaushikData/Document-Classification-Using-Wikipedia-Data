      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2943">An '''adult high school''' or '''adult school''' is a [[high school]] facility designed for [[adult education]]. It is intended for adults who have not completed high school to continue their education. Some adult high schools offer child care, special integration programs for immigrants and refugees, career and other programs and services geared toward the special needs of adult students. Some adult high schools may also offer general interest programs such as computer skills or other [[continuing education]] courses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13063">The '''Advanced Distributed Learning''' ('''ADL''') '''Initiative''' is a US government program that conducts research and development on distributed learning and coordinates related efforts broadly across public and private organizations. ADL reports to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Education and Training (DASD(FE&amp;T)) in the US Department of Defense (DoD). Although a DoD program, ADL serves the entire US federal government, operates a global partnership network including international defense ministries and US-based academic partners, and collaborates closely with industry and academia.  ADL advises the DoD and US government on emerging learning technologies, best practices for improving learning effectiveness and efficiency, and methods for enhancing interoperability. Notable ADL contributions to distributed learning include the [[Sharable Content Object Reference Model]] (SCORM), [[Experience API (Tin Can API)|Experience API]] (xAPI), and the DoD Instruction 1322.26.

== History ==
The ADL Initiative traces its antecedents to the early 1990s, when Congress authorized and appropriated funds for the National Guard to build prototype electronic classrooms and learning networks to increase personnel’s access to learning opportunities. By the mid-1990s, DoD realized the need for a more coordinated approach, and the ''1996 Quadrennial Defense Review''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=William S|title=Report of the Quadrennial Defense Review|date=May 1996|publisher=Secretary of Defense|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; formalized this by directing development of a Department-wide strategy for modernizing technology-based education and training. This strategy became the original ADL Initiative, and in 1998, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&amp;R), in collaboration with the Services, Joint Staff, Under Secretaries of Defense for Acquisition and Technology and the Comptroller), to lead ADL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness (ODUSD(R)), Readiness and Training|title=Department of Defense Strategic Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning (Report to the 106th Congress)|date=April 30, 1999|url=http://prhome.defense.gov/portals/52/documents/rfm/readiness/docs/adl_stratplan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Deputy Secretary of Defense also directed the USD(P&amp;R) to produce the Department-wide policy for advanced distributed learning, develop a corresponding “master plan” to carry out the policy, and to ensure sufficient programs and resources were available for the associated implementation (see the 1999 ADL Strategic Plan in Appendix 1 for more details).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Department of Defense Strategic Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning (Report to the 106th Congress)|date=April 30, 1999|publisher=Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness (ODUSD(R)), Readiness and Training|url=http://prhome.defense.gov/portals/52/documents/rfm/readiness/docs/adl_stratplan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1998, the DoD and other Federal agencies (e.g., the Department of Labor) had each established their own ADL projects, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) moved to consolidate these via the Federal Training Technology Initiative. Thus, following guidance from Congress, OSTP, and the National Partnership for Reinventing Government, the DoD ADL Initiative was grown into a Federal-wide program. Specific direction for this can be found in Section 378 of Public Law 105-261, the ''Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999|publisher=Pub. L. 105-261, 112 Stat. 1920|url=https://www.congress.gov/105/plaws/publ261/PLAW-105publ261.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which required the Secretary of Defense to develop a strategic plan for expanding distance learning initiatives, as well as ''Executive Order 13111'' (President William J. Clinton, 12 January 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=President Clinton|first1=William J|title=Executive Order 13111 (Using Technology to Improve Training Opportunities for Federal Government Employees)|date=January 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Executive Order, titled “Using Technology to Improve Training Opportunities for Federal Government Employees,” established a task force and advisory committee to explore how federal training programs, initiatives, and policies can better support lifelong learning through the use of learning technologies and to provide learning standards, specifications, and applications which can be sustained and extended to incorporate new technologies and learning science as they occur.

Shortly after President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] signed ''[[Executive Order 13111]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=President Clinton|first1=William J|title=Executive Order 13111 (Using Technology to Improve Training Opportunities for Federal Government Employees)|date=January 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Pentagon released the ''Department of Defense Strategic Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning'' (April 30, 1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness (ODUSD(R)), Readiness and Training|title=Department of Defense Strategic Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning (Report to the 106th Congress)|date=April 30, 1999|url=http://prhome.defense.gov/portals/52/documents/rfm/readiness/docs/adl_stratplan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the corresponding ''Department of Defense Implementation Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning'' (May 19, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness (ODUSD(R)), Readiness and Training|title=Department of Defense Implementation Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning|date=May 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy empowers the ADL Initiative to:
* Influence the development/use of common industry standards
* Enable acquisition of interoperable tools and content
* Create a robust and dynamic network infrastructure for distribution
* Enable the modernization of supporting resources
* Engender cultural change to move from “classroom-centric” to “learner-centric”
Since its inception in the 1990s, the ADL Initiative has achieved several notable milestones, including the development of SCORM, ADL PlugFests, xAPI, and the Total Learning Architecture (TLA). More information about the history and products of ADL can be found in the ADL-sponsored book, ''Learning on Demand: ADL and the Future of e-Learning'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative|title=Learning on Demand: ADL and the Future of e-Learning|date=2010|publisher=Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2010.

== Organization ==
The ADL Initiative reports to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Education and Training (DASD(FE&amp;T)), who reports to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness (ASD(R)), who in turn reports to the Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&amp;R)) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

== Subject Areas ==
ADL uses the term “distributed learning” broadly, to refer to all network-centric learning technologies and their corresponding best practices for their use. Similarly, ADL uses the term “learning” to include education, training, operational performance support, and other forms of ad hoc, just-in-time, or self-directed learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Department of Defense Strategic Plan for Advanced Distributed Learning (Report to the 106th Congress)|date=April 30, 1999|publisher=Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness (ODUSD(R)), Readiness and Training|url=http://prhome.defense.gov/portals/52/documents/rfm/readiness/docs/adl_stratplan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these topical areas, ADL conducts research and development (Budget Area 6.3, [[Science policy of the United States#Defense research and development|Advanced Technology Development]]), facilitates coordination, and assists with the implementation of emerging science and technologies. More precisely, ADL’s work emphasizes the following six areas: [7]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research|url=https://www.adlnet.gov/adl-research/|website=ADLnet.gov|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* e-Learning (e.g., traditional web-based courseware)
* Mobile learning (m-Learning) and associated mobile performance support
* Web-based virtual worlds and simulations
* Learning analytics and performance modeling
* Associated learning theory (e.g., pedagogy, andragogy, instructional design)
* Distributed learning interoperability specifications

== SCORM ==
When ADL was established, the use of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) was increasing rapidly, but the content delivered through those systems remained separated (locked into silos).  For example, while the Navy and Army have standard courses with similar content, that content could not be shared and reused from one service to another because their LMSs would not allow it. The silo’d nature of content delivered through LMSs was not cost efficient, and became one of ADL’s first challenges to tackle resulting in the development of the SCORM (sharable content object reference model).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCORM|url=https://www.adlnet.gov/adl-research/scorm/|website=ADLnet.gov|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
SCORM, which integrates a set of related technical standards, specifications, and guidelines designed to meet high-level requirements—accessible, reusable, interoperable, and durable content and systems is arguably one of ADL’s most well known projects. SCORM content can be delivered to learners via any SCORM-conformant LMS using the same version of SCORM.  Due to the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1322.26,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness|title=Development, Management, and Delivery of Distributed Learning (DoD Instruction 1322.26)|date=16 June 2006|publisher=Department of Defense|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCORM is a mature technology which has been widely adopted.

== Experience API ==
In 2011, ADL recognized the need for a software specification that tracks learning experiences that occur outside of a LMS and a web browser.  As a result, ADL issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) asking for assistance in improving SCORM. The BAA was awarded to Rustici Software, a Nashville-based software company experienced with SCORM.
Rustici Software conducted numerous interviews with the e-learning community to determine where improvements needed to be made and developed the research version of the Experience API specification as a result.  This process was called Project Tin Can.  The moniker “Tin Can API” was derived from Project Tin Can.  When version 1.0 was officially released in April 2013, the specification was dubbed “xAPI” but by that time, some people already knew the specification by the original moniker.  
The Experience API (xAPI) allows the capture of big data on human performance, along with associated instructional content or performance context information. xAPI applies “activity streams” to tracking data and provides sub-APIs to access and store information about state and content.  This enables nearly dynamic tracking of activities from any platform or software system—from traditional LMSs to mobile devices, simulations, wearables, physical beacons, and more.

== Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1322.26 ==
Under delegated authority, ADL stewards DoDI 1322.26, “Development, Management, and Delivery of Distributed Learning.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness|title=Development, Management, and Delivery of Distributed Learning (DoD Instruction 1322.26)|date=16 June 2006|publisher=Department of Defense|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This DoDI provides guidance to support implementation of DoD Directive (DoDD) 1322.18, “Military Training.”

==Early life and education==
Krueger grew up in a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/172080/meet-the-four-jews-shaping-the-us-economy/ The Jewish Daily Forward: "Meet the Four Jews Shaping the U.S. Economy" By Nathan Guttman] February 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Livingston, New Jersey]], and graduated from [[Livingston High School (Livingston, New Jersey)|Livingston High School]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Kwoh, Leslie. [http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2011/08/obama_krueger_chair_economic.html "Obama to tap Princeton's Alan Krueger to fill key economic post"], ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', August 29, 2011. Accessed August 29, 2011. "Krueger, 50, a Livingston native, returned to academia a year ago after serving for two years as assistant treasury secretary for economic policy to the Obama administration."&lt;/ref&gt;

Krueger received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[Industrial and Labor Relations]] from [[Cornell University]] (with honors), and he received his [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Economics]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1985 and 1987, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;https://krueger.princeton.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Krueger developed and applied the method of [[natural experiment]]s to study the effect of education on earnings, the [[minimum wage]] on employment, and other issues.

Krueger compared restaurant jobs in New Jersey, which raised its minimum wage, to restaurant jobs in Pennsylvania, which did not, and found that restaurant employment in New Jersey increased, while it decreased in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/weekinreview/conversations-david-card-alan-krueger-two-economists-catch-clinton-s-eye-bucking.html|title=Conversations/David Card and Alan Krueger; Two Economists Catch Clinton's Eye By Bucking the Common Wisdom|first=Sylvia|last=Nasar|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 22, 1993|accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results reinvigorated the academic debate on the employment effects of minimum wages and spawned a large and often conflicted literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmitt|first1=John|title=Why Does the Minimum Wage Have No Discernible Effect on Employment?|url=https://cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf|website=cepr.net/|publisher=Centre for Economic and Policy Research|accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His books, ''Education Matters: Selected Essays by Alan B. Krueger'' and (with [[James Heckman]]) ''Inequality in America: What Role for Human Capital Policies?'' review the available research relating to positive [[externality|externalities]] accruing to society from increased government investment in educating the children of the poor.  His summary of the available research shows relatively high returns to society from educational investments that have been shown in numerous formal and natural experiments to reduce crime and recidivism.  At one point, he concluded he does "not envision investment in human capital development as the sole component of a program to address the adverse consequences of income inequality.  It is part of the solution, but not the whole solution.  In principle, the optimal governmental policy regarding income inequality would employ multiple instruments, up to the point at which the social benefit per additional dollar of cost of each instrument is equal across all instruments."&lt;ref&gt;Heckman and Krueger (2003, p. 62)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''What Makes a Terrorist: Economics and the Roots of Terrorism'' (2007), he wrote that in contrast to the assumption that terrorists come from impoverished, uneducated environments, terrorists often come from middle-class, college-educated backgrounds.&lt;ref name="What Makes a Terrorist"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krueger|first=Alan B.|title=What Makes a Terrorist: Economics and the Roots of Terrorism|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13438-3|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/62904/lawrence-d-freedman/the-history-of-terrorism-from-antiquity-to-al-qaeda-denial-of-sa|title=Review: What Makes a Terrorist|first=Lawrence D.|last=Freedman|date=November–December 2007|accessdate=August 29, 2011|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994-95 he served as Chief Economist at the [[United States Department of Labor]]. He received the Kershaw Prize, Mahalanobis Prize, and IZA Prize (with [[David Card]]), and is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Society of Labor Economists, Econometric Society and American Academy of Political and Social Science. He is a member of [http://www.cerge-ei.cz/people/executive-and-supervisory-committee the Executive and Supervisory Committee (ESC)] of [[CERGE-EI]], an academic institution located in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cerge.cuni.cz/&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also published many books on issues related to education, labor markets and income distribution. He is also known for his work on the [[Environmental Kuznets Curve]].

[[File:Anna Cheney Edwards.png|thumb|Anna Cheney Edwards]]
'''Anna Cheney Edwards''' (31 July 1835 - 1930) was a 19th-century American educator from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Massachusetts]]. She
served as Associate Principal of  [[Mount Holyoke Seminary]], 1872-1888; and as Professor of Theism and Christian Evidences, 1888-1890.{{sfn|Mount Holyoke|1913|p=48}}

==Early years and education==
Anna Cheney Edwards was born in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], 31 July 1835. Her father, Charles, was sixth in descent from Alexander Edwards, one of the early settlers of the town. Her mother, Ruth White, of [[Spencer, Massachusetts]], was also of [[Puritan]] ancestry.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=273}} Granddaughter of Nathaniel Edwards and Rachel Clapp, his wife; great-granddaughter of Benjamin Clapp and Phebe Boynton, his wife; and great-great-granddaughter of Jonathan Clapp and Submit Strong, his wife.
{{sfn|Daughters of the American Revolution|1904|p=69}} Edwards outlived all eight of her siblings.{{sfn|Clark|1882|p=114}}

There was an early fondness for books and a predilection for teaching. Edwards remembers making up her mind, on her first day of her attending school, at the age of four years, that she was to be a teacher. This was an inherited fondness, as her father and grandfather had successively taught the district school near the old Edwards homestead. Her great-grandfather, Nathaniel Edwards, was worthy of mention in the days of higher education for women, for his labors in the instruction of the girls of his neighborhood during vacation periods, because in his time, they were not allowed to attend school with the boys during the regular terms.

The teaching career began at the age of 16, after Edwards had passed through the public schools of Northampton, in an outer district of the town. After two years of experience, she entered Mount Holyoke Seminary (now [[Mount Holyoke College]]), [[South Hadley, Massachusetts]], in September, 1853. At the end of one year, her studies were interrupted by three years more of teaching, after which she returned to the seminary and was graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in July, 1859.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=273}}

In 1888, the degree of Master of Arts was conferred upon her by Burlington University (now [[University of Vermont]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=74}}{{sfn|University of Vermont|1901|p=227}}

==Career==
Edwards was recalled as assistant teacher in the following year and was a member of the Holyoke faculty most of her career thereafter. She was absent at one period for about two years, her health being somewhat impaired, and from 1866 to 1868, she was principal of Lake Erie Seminary, [[Plainville, Ohio]]. She spent 18 months in travel in Europe, and in vacations, she took separate trips to [[New Orleans]], [[California]], [[Alaska]] and various parts of the United States and Canada. She was appointed second associate principal of Mount Holyoke Seminary in 1872, and first associate in 1883. A college charter having been obtained for that institution in 1888, she was made professor of [[theism]] and Christian evidences, and instructor of ancient literature. In scientific studies, she shared the enthusiasm and the wide reading of [[Lydia White Shattuck]], the botanist, and became herself an earnest student and teacher of geology. She was identified with her alma mater in its religious character and work. For the use of her classes she printed in 1877 a volume of "Notes on Ancient Literature." She gave lectures to classes and to ladies' literary societies on a variety of topics.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=273-74}}

Her more public activities were in the way of papers and addresses before the different associations of Holyoke alumnae and in connection with women's missionary meetings. From 1876, served as vice-president of the Hampshire County Branch of the Woman's Board of Missions.  She died in 1930.&lt;ref name="virginia.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edwards, Anna C.

'''Appreciative Advising''' (AA) is a social-constructivist advising philosophy that provides a framework for optimizing advisor interactions with students in both individual and group settings.&lt;ref name="The Appreciative Advising Revolution"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Bloom, Hutson, &amp; He|title=The Appreciative Advising Revolution|year=2008|publisher=Stipes|location=Urbana-Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heart and soul of appreciative advising is the organizational development theory of [[appreciative inquiry]] that was developed in 1979 by David Cooperrider at [[Case Western Reserve University]]. Appreciative advising also draws from the [[positive psychology]], [[Social constructivism|social constructivist theory]], and [[Rational choice theory|choice theory]] literature.

== History ==
Appreciative advising emerged from an article written by Jennifer L. Bloom and Nancy Archer Martin titled "Incorporating Appreciative Inquiry into Academic Advising" that appeared in the online academic advising journal at Penn State, ''The Mentor'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://dus.psu.edu/mentor/ ''The Mentor'']&lt;/ref&gt; on August 29, 2002.  Subsequently, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) began implementing the concepts outlined in the article and began to demonstrate success in terms of student retention.  Bryant Hutson and Scott Amundsen at UNCG coined the term "appreciative advising". Bloom, Hutson, and He (2008) wrote the first book, titled ''The Appreciative Advising Revolution'', on the topic.  Institutions and academic advisors from throughout the country are now utilizing the appreciative advising approach to guide their advising programs and interactions with students.

In 2012, the University of South Carolina began offering an online Appreciative Advising course as well as a process for certifying appreciative advisers.  Building on the success of the Appreciative approach to academic advising, the movement has expanded to other areas, including teaching (appreciative college instruction), orientation, admissions, Greek life, and tutoring. This expansion of the principles of appreciative advising is now known as appreciative education.

== The core of appreciative advising ==

=== The six phases ===

:'''Disarm'''
:The Disarm phase involves making a positive first impression with students and allaying any fear or suspicion they might have of meeting with the advisor.
:'''Discover'''
:The Discover phase is spent continuing to build rapport with students and learning about their strengths, skills, and abilities through utilizing effective and positive open-ended questions that encourages narratives.
:'''Dream'''
:The Dream phase involves uncovering students' hopes and dreams for their futures.
:'''Design'''
:The Design phase is spent co-creating a plan to make their hopes and dreams come true.
:'''Deliver'''
:The Deliver phase is the implementation phase where students carry out their plan, and the advisor’s role is to support them as they encounter roadblocks.
:'''Don't Settle'''
:The Don't Settle phase involves challenging students to achieve their full potential and supporting them along their journey.&lt;ref name=Web&gt;{{cite web|title=The Six Phases of Appreciative Advising|url=http://AppreciativeAdvising.net|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appreciative advising certification==

===Professional certification===
The University of South Carolina's Office of Appreciative Education now offers a professional rating for academic advisers: Appreciative Advising Certification. Certified Appreciative Advisors are committed to a standard of excellence in the field of advising and optimizing their students' educational experiences. The certification process includes successful attendance of the Appreciative advising Institute or completion of the appreciative advising course, as well as completed advising rubrics, recommendations, a current CV, and personal advising theory.&lt;ref name=Certification&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Certification |url=http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/apadv_certification.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926021409/http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/apadv_certification.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of certification===
*Advanced professional qualification &lt;ref name=Certification /&gt;
*Increased skills and knowledge
*Raised professional expectations
*Elevated advising experience for students

===Appreciative Advising Institute===
The Appreciative Advising Institute was first held in August 2011 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The 2012 Appreciative Advising Institute was held July 28–31 in Charleston, SC. The Institute is intentionally designed to teach participants the theoretical structure of appreciative advising and to provide skills training in implementing this framework. This conference is designed to provide ample opportunity for participants to extend theory to practice.  Participants learn how the six phases help both the advisor and advisee optimize their educational experiences. Participants are encouraged and given the opportunity to reflect on their own goals and dreams to optimize their own lives.&lt;ref name=AAI&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Appreciative Advising Institute |url=http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/Default.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926021400/http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/Default.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appreciative Advising Course===
The Appreciative Advising Course is designed to be a community of learners (instructors included). There are opportunities for participants to interact with other community members each week. This is done via discussion board conversations, as well as optional live chat dialogues. Active participants greatly enhance their own learning experience as well as that of the community. This is an eight-week course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appreciative Advising Course |url=http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/apadv_course.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924212922/http://www.ed.sc.edu/conferences/appreciativeadvising/apadv_course.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== More about UNCG's usage of appreciative advising ==

=== Academic recovery programming ===
When students feel academically discouraged, such as when they are on academic probation, they may need to be reminded of the strengths that led them to college in the first place.  Students in academic trouble also typically have a limited time in which to improve their status. Practically, it is quicker to correct this status by building on strengths, and maintaining a course load and engaging in academic and social behaviors that reflect these strengths, than it is to attempt to correct long-standing deficits.  The SAS 100 program at UNCG is a great example of this application. The course features the use of the Appreciative Advising Inventory as the basis for three mandatory advising sessions and the use of appreciative advising questions in weekly reflections and discussions.  All instructors are trained to use appreciative advising in their meetings with the students. After the appreciative approach was introduced, retention of SAS 100 students improved 18%. When control and treatment groups were compared, the treatment group achieved a statistically significant GPA gain of .73 (p=. 03) compared to the control group at .42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hutson, B.L. He, Y., Amundsen|title=Evaluating the impact of Appreciative Advising across higher education institutions: A multi-site evaluation (Poster Presentation at the annual meeting of the American Evaluation Association, Portland, OR.)|date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal transfer advising ===
Appreciative advising is also particularly useful in internal transfer cases in which a student has realized that their current declared major may not be a good fit, but are struggling to identify a new major. Student Academic Services at UNCG has used appreciative advising to assist declared pre-nursing majors who have not met continuance requirements.  This began as a pilot program in the spring of 2005, and currently includes all pre-nursing majors who have a cumulative GPA that has been identified as not competitive by the School of Nursing.  The goal of the program is to help students explore their options, given that they are unlikely to be accepted into the School of Nursing.  Of the 145 students served by the program during the spring and fall semesters of 2005, 30% have changed their major, while an additional 43% continue to receive advising through Student Academic Services.  The mean GPA for participants has also improved dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hutson|first=B.L|author2=Atwood, J.A.|title=Outcome evaluation to support freshman orientation program|date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First-year Experience Program ===
UNCG's [[First-Year Experience]] program is called University Studies 101 (UNS 101), and uses a curriculum emphasizing appreciative advising. One stated aim of the program is to assist students in discovering their purposes, identifying their strengths, and aligning these newly discovered assets with plans for their future.  The activities, class discussions, and assignments used in the course guide students through the six appreciative advising stages. A comprehensive program evaluation which includes the tracking of academic outcomes and assessment of student attitudes and behaviors has evidenced the positive impact of the UNS 101 program (Hutson &amp; Atwood, 2005). For example, the freshman to sophomore retention rate of freshmen who completed UNS 101 in fall 2006 and returned for fall 2007 was 81.9%. This compares to a retention rate of 74.4% for freshmen who did not take the course. Meanwhile, the average first semester GPA for students who did not take the course was 2.49, while UNS 101 participants had an average first semester GPA of 2.72.

The '''Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad''' (APMO) starting from 1989 is a regional mathematics competition which involves countries from the Asian Pacific region.  The United States also takes part in the APMO. Every year, APMO is held in the afternoon of the second Monday of March for participating countries in the North and South Americas, and in the morning of the second Tuesday of March for participating countries on the Western Pacific and in Asia.

==APMO's Aims==
* the discovering, encouraging and challenging of mathematically gifted school students in all Pacific-Rim countries
* the fostering of friendly international relations and cooperation between students and teachers in the Pacific-Rim Region
* the creating of an opportunity for the exchange of information on school syllabi and practice throughout the Pacific Region
* the encouragement and support of mathematical involvement with Olympiad type activities, not only in the APMO participating countries, but also in other Pacific-Rim countries.

==Scoring and Format==
The APMO contest consists of one four-hour paper consisting of five questions of varying difficulty and each having a maximum score of 7 points. Contestants should not have formally enrolled at a university (or equivalent post-secondary institution) and they must be younger than 20 years of age on 1 July of the year of the contest.

'''Certified Software Development Professional (CSDP)''' is a [[professional certification]] in [[software engineering]] conformal to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO/IEC 24773]]. 

This certification was offered by the [[IEEE Computer Society]] to experienced software engineering and software development practitioners since 2002.&lt;ref name="Accreditation Announcement"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  After December 2014 this certification program has been discontinued, all issued certificates are recognized as valid forever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computer.org/web/volunteers/board-meeting-minutes#2014 IEEE Computer Society Board Of Governors Meeting Minutes, 18 Nov. 2014]&amp;nbsp; Discontinuation Date&lt;/ref&gt; A number of new similar certifications were introduced by the [[IEEE Computer Society]], including the ''Professional Software Engineering Master (PSEM)'' and ''Professional Software Engineering Process Master (PSEPM)'' Certifications.

To become a '''Certified Software Development Professional''' candidates had to have four years (initially six years) of professional software engineering experience, pass a three-and-half-hour, 180-question [[Test (assessment)|examination]] on various knowledge areas of software engineering, and possess at least a [[bachelor's degree]] in Computer Science or Software Engineering. The CSDP examination tested candidates' proficiency in internationally accepted, industry-standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005 | publisher = [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33897 | accessdate = 2011-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; software engineering principles and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge | publisher = [[IEEE Computer Society]] | url=http://www.swebok.org | accessdate = 2011-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CSDP credential holders are also obligated to adhere to the [[IEEE]]/[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]'s Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Software Engineering Code of Ethics | publisher = [[Association for Computing Machinery]] |url=http://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/Publications/code-of-ethics.pdf | accessdate = 2011-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The IEEE Computer Society introduced the CSDP in 2002, and on October 27, 2008, it became the first certification to conform to ISO/IEC 24773 standard for software engineering certification.&lt;ref&gt;Details of ISO Accreditation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determination of eligibility==
Candidates had to undergo a [[peer review]] of their education and professional qualifications in order to receive authorization to take the CSDP examination. Candidates therefore had to submit an application to the [[IEEE Computer Society]] that provided verifiable information regarding their educational background and professional experience.

The '''Certified Software Development Associate''' certification was available to graduating software engineers and early-career software professionals who did not meet the eligibility requirements for the CSDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[IEEE Computer Society]] | title = CSDA: Certified Software Development Associate |url=http://www.computer.org/portal/web/certification/csda | accessdate = 2010-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CSDP examination content==
The CSDP examination content was based on the ''[[Software Engineering Body of Knowledge|Guide To The Software Engineering Body of Knowledge]]''.  The examination covered content from all primary knowledge areas in the SWEBOK Guide Version 3. Below is a list of the topics tested in terms of their proportion of the total examination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/Certification/CertificationForms/Bulletins/CSDP%20Bulletin%202011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also starred in the films ''[[Cabin Boy (film)|Cabin Boy]]'', ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[Scary Movie 2]]'', and ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]''. He is currently starring as Roland Schitt on [[CBC Television]]'s ''[[Schitt's Creek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/schittscreek/cast/chris-elliott |title=''Schitt's Creek cast: Chris Elliott (1960–) |publisher=CBC Television |date= |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Elliott was born in [[New York City]], and is the youngest of five children of Lee (née Peppers), a model and TV director, and [[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]], who was part of the successful comedy team [[Bob and Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/60/Chris-Elliott.html|title=Chris Elliott Biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brooks.govoffice2.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B6FD8DCED-2C4D-493E-BFCE-FE09340BA711%7D|title=Brooks Maine – Pilley House Donation – Bangor Daily News Article|publisher=Brooks.govoffice2.com|date=June 3, 2005|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9E0DEEDD1F3AF93AA15757C0A9649D8B63.html|title=Paid Notice: Deaths ELLIOTT, LEE K|date=April 29, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=October 25, 2017|via=query.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up on the [[Upper East Side]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koepp|first=Stephen|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20088901,00.html|title=Off-the-Wall Comedy Lands Chris Elliott on TV, and His Dad, Bob (of Bob and Ray), Is Hooked Too|publisher=[[People.com]]|accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center|National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]] in the spring of 1979.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Career==
Elliott was hired as a production assistant on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', and was with the show from its very beginning in February 1982.  Over the first year of the show, he was seen on camera irregularly and usually in small sketch roles.  In the spring of 1983, Elliott became a writer on the show and his on-camera appearances became more frequent.  He became known in the mid-to-late 1980s for playing an assortment of recurring quirky, oddball characters on ''Late Night''. His characters on the show included:

* "The Conspiracy Guy": During staged audience "question and answer" sessions with Dave, Elliott would approach the microphone and begin accusing Letterman of various plots and schemes, after which "security" would wrestle Elliott to the ground and drag him out of the studio while Elliott yelled threats to Dave.
* "The Panicky Guy": Elliott would pretend to be an audience member, who panics and runs from the studio at the slightest threat of danger (similar to doomed characters in disaster movies). Once in the hallway he would be run over and crushed by an advancing floor waxer, with his hands raised in terror. In one variation, he played a German Panicky Guy in Lederhosen, who was run over by a hand dolly full of cheese wheels.
* "The Guy Under the Seats": a short character-comedy bit followed by Elliott as himself (living under the seats, that is) who eventually becomes angry at Letterman and threatens him with some metaphorically articulated comeuppance in the future and always closing with the line "But until that day, I'm gonna be right here, making your life...a living hell."
* "The Fugitive Guy": a parody of the TV series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''
* "The Regulator Guy": a parody of ''[[The Terminator]]'' films. The Regulator Guy spoke with a vaguely Germanic accent and claimed to be "from the future". The Regulator Guy segments were usually pre-taped and presented by Letterman as the trailer for an upcoming television series. The font used for the title was similar to the font used for the then-popular American television series ''[[The Equalizer]]''. Chris in fact appeared on an episode of [[The Equalizer]] playing a peeping Tom mildly assaulted by the Equalizer. In the Regulator Guy's only live, on-stage appearance, Elliott, carried by wires, "flew" over the audience via [[jet pack]] onto the ''Late Night'' set. The "jet pack" prop appeared to malfunction, which the Regulator Guy then blamed for ruining his dramatic appearance.
* "Marlon Brando": a parody of Brando, whom Elliott portrays as a semi-deranged man who performs a "banana dance" to the tune of [[Alley Cat (song)|"Alley Cat"]].
* "Chris Elliott, Jr.": a spoof of talk-show host [[Morton Downey, Jr.]]
* "A Television Miracle": During one ''Late Night'' special focused on short films, Elliott was the star of a short about himself, alluding that he was actually an animatronic being that was created for the TV show.  The "miracle" was the behind-the-scenes work needed to bring his character to life and others.

As his career on ''Late Night'' blossomed, Elliott also took small movie roles, often as a supporting actor in non-[[Comedy film|comedies]] such as [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]'s ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'' and [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[The Abyss]]''.  He also has a small supporting role in an episode of ''[[Miami Vice]]''.

In 1986, Elliott co-wrote and starred in the Cinemax special ''FDR: A One Man Show'', a spoof comedy about the life and times of the president. Elliott looked and sounded nothing like the man; he portrayed events from Roosevelt's life that never happened, such as a Japanese bombing of the [[White House]], and his crossing the Potomac in a rowboat. By the end of the show, he had performed [[Gallagher (comedian)|Gallagher's]] shtick of smashing watermelons and other soft fruits on stage.

[[File:Chris Elliott at the 41st Emmy Awards.jpg|thumb|left|Chris Elliott at the [[41st Primetime Emmy Awards|41st Emmy Awards]] in 1989]]

Elliott left ''Late Night'' in early 1990, though he would return as a guest interview subject many, many times on ''Late Night'' and Letterman's subsequent talk show ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]''.

In 1990, Elliott created and starred in his own sitcom, which was called ''[[Get a Life (TV series)|Get a Life]]'', about a 30-year-old paperboy named Chris Peterson who lived at home with his parents. Elliott's real-life father, [[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]], appeared in the show as Chris' father.  The January 1999 issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'' called the "Zoo Animals on Wheels" episode the 19th funniest TV moment of all time.

In 1993, Elliott teamed up with producer [[Brad Hall (producer)|Brad Hall]] and directed a series of critically acclaimed short films that Elliott showed when appearing on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.

Elliott became a cast member of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1994. Also that year, Elliott starred in his first movie—entitled ''[[Cabin Boy]]''—which also featured a short appearance by Elliott's old boss, [[David Letterman]], and was produced by [[Tim Burton]]. He was nominated for a [[Razzie Award]] as Worst New Star.

In 2007 Elliott again began appearing on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' with fellow former Letterman writer Gerard Mulligan. On average, these bits appeared once per month.

His other television credits include the chowder taster on ''Throwdown with Bobby Flay'', airdate 09/02/09, and the voice of [[Dogbert]] on the short-run show ''[[Dilbert (TV series)|Dilbert]]'' for [[UPN]]. He played a [[serial killer]] in the series ''[[Third Watch]]'' in episodes 5, "The Hunter, Hunted," and 6, "Greatest Detectives in the World" from season six. He played the role of Peter in the last three seasons of ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' and a role in a semi-autobiographical sitcom pilot for [[CBS]], entitled ''You've Reached the Elliotts'', playing a man who tries to balance a modest show business career with his home life. As of 2009, Elliott has played the estranged father of ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' character Lily Aldrin, whose relationship has strengthened as the show has progressed. As well as multiple appearances on ''[[The King of Queens]]'', Elliott made guest appearances on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'', ''[[That '70s Show]]'' episode "2000 Light Years From Home", and ''[[According to Jim]]''.
From February 3, 2011 to January 16, 2014, Elliott has starred in the [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Eagleheart (TV series)|Eagleheart]]'', produced by [[Conan O'Brien]]'s production company, [[Conaco]].

In 2015, he had a guest role on an episode of NBC's ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'' and began a starring role as Roland Schitt in ''[[Schitt's Creek]]''.

Elliott was also in an ''[[Avocados from Mexico]]'' commercial in February 2018.

==Author==
Elliott has written three books spoofing history or pseudo-history. ''[[Daddy's Boy: A Son's Shocking Account of Life with a Famous Father]]'' is a comedic fictionalized biography about growing up with his famous father, spoofing [[Christina Crawford]]'s ''[[Mommie Dearest]]''. ''[[The Shroud of the Thwacker]]'' is a historical novel about Elliott's investigation of a [[serial killer]] in 1882 New York City, spoofing London's infamous [[Jack the Ripper]] case. ''[[Into Hot Air]]'' tells the story of Chris climbing [[Mount Everest]] with a group of celebrities tagging along to underwrite the trek as he investigates his Uncle Percy's failed Everest expedition.

==Personal life==
Elliott has been married to Paula Niedert since 1986. Niedert worked as a talent coordinator on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' when they met. They have two daughters: [[Abby Elliott|Abby]] and [[Bridey Elliott|Bridey]]. Abby was a cast member of ''Saturday Night Live'' from 2008 until 2012, making her the first ''SNL'' cast member to be the child of a past cast member. His father [[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]], of the popular comedy duo [[Bob &amp; Ray]], co-starred on an ''SNL'' Christmas episode in the [[History of Saturday Night Live (1975–1980)#1978–1979 season|1978–1979]] (fourth) season,&lt;ref name="HR1"&gt;{{Cite news|title='SNL' taps Abby Elliott, Michaela Watkins|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=November 12, 2008|author=Andreeva, Nellie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{Cite news|title=A Professionally Funny Family|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/magazine/29Elliott-t.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 24, 2009|author=Zuckerman, Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; making for three generations of Elliotts on ''SNL''.

He has blogged for the [[Mathematical Association of America]], [[The Huffington Post]], [[Scientific American]], and (aperiodically) for The Aperiodical;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aperiodical.com/ The Aperiodical]&lt;/ref&gt; his puzzles have been featured in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=celebrations1&gt;''[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/celebrations-of-mind-honor-mathe28099s-best-friend-martin-gardner/ Celebrations of Mind Honor Math’s Best Friend, Martin Gardner]'' by Colm Mulcahy, Scientific American, 29 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/author/colm-mulcahy/ 11 Stories By Colm Mulcahy In Scientific American]&lt;/ref&gt; Mulcahy serves on the Advisory Council of the [[Museum of Mathematics]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://momath.org/about/advisory-council/ Museum of Mathematics: Advisory Council]&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently Vice-President of [[Gathering 4 Gardner, Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gathering4gardner.org/board-of-directors/ Gathering 4 Gardner: Board of Directors]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Mulcahy got his BSc and MSc in mathematical science at [[University College Dublin]] in 1978 and 1979, and a PhD from [[Cornell University]] in 1985 where his advisor was [[Alex F. T. W. Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name=allendoerfer/&gt; Since 1988 he has been teaching at [[Spelman College]], in [[Atlanta]], Georgia where he is currently professor.  He served as chair of the department of mathematics at Spelman from 2003 to 2006 and recently created the Archive of Spelman Mathematicians.&lt;ref name=spellman&gt;[http://www.spelman.edu/about-us/news-and-events/our-stories/stories/2016/01/29/professor-colm-mulcahy Spelman College] January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 he received the MAA's [[Allendoerfer Award]] for excellence in expository writing for a paper on the basics of [[Wavelet transform#Wavelet compression|wavelet image compression]].&lt;ref name=allendoerfer&gt;[http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/plotting-and-scheming-with-wavelets Carl B. Allendoerfer award: ''Plotting and Scheming with Wavelets'' by Colm Mulcahy]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he was one of the organizers of [[Mathematics Awareness Month]].&lt;ref name=mathware&gt;[http://www.mathaware.org/mam/2014/committee/ Mathematics Awareness Month 2014: Mathematics, Magic, and Mystery] Committee Members&lt;/ref&gt; An article he co-authored, on the centennial of Martin Gardner, was featured in the book, ''The Best Writing on Mathematics 2015''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://press.princeton.edu/TOCs/c10558.html The Best Writing on Mathematics 2015]'' Edited by Mircea Pitici, Princeton University Press, 2015, {{ISBN|0691169659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulcahy has an Erdös number is 2 as a result of a collaboration with [[Neil Calkin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://files.oakland.edu/users/grossman/enp/Erdos0.html Coauthors of Paul Erdos, see Neil Calkin] ''Gallia Est Omnis Divisa in Partes Quattuor'' by Neil Calkin and Colm Mulcahy, in ''The mathematics of various entertaining subjects: research in recreational math'', edited by Jennifer Elaine Beineke and Jason Rosenhouse, Princeton University Press, [2016] {{ISBN|0691164037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Card magic==
Mulcahy is recognised as an authority on the mathematical principles and effects underlying cards tricks.&lt;ref name=of_mind/&gt; From 2004 to 2014 he authored ''Card Colm'', a column about mathematics and magic–especially card magic–for the [[Mathematical Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/community/maa-columns MAA Columns: Card Colm by Colm Mulcahy] Mathematical Association of America&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this work is collected in his book ''Mathematical Card Magic: Fifty-Two New Effects'' &lt;ref&gt;''Mathematical Card Magic: Fifty-Two New Effects''  A K Peters/CRC Press (2013)  {{ISBN|1466509767}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has appeared in Brady Haran's [[Numberphile]] web series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4izjrtR8Ozg Little Fibs – Numberphile] 'Mathemagician' Colm Mulcahy, 2 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy of Martin Gardner==
Mulcahy was a friend of longtime Scientific American columnist [[Martin Gardner]] during the last decade of Gardner's life. In 2016 Mulcahy became the Vice-President of [[Gathering for Gardner]], an organisation formed to honour the wide ranging contributions made by the celebrated mathematician, skeptic, magician, philosopher, and writer. Usually shortened to G4G, it first met in 1993 and since 1996 meets every two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/news/math-news/tom-rodgers-organizer-of-gathering-for-gardner-and-celebration-of-mind-dies-at-67 Tom Rodgers, Organizer of Gathering for Gardner and Celebration of Mind, Dies at 67]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he created the official Martin Gardner site, and in 2013–2014 he chaired the Martin Gardner Centennial Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://martin-gardner.org/ official Martin Gardner site]&lt;/ref&gt; Mulcahy has been particularly active in promoting an associated series of meetings known as [[Gathering 4 Gardner#Celebration of Mind|Celebration of Mind]], also inspired by the works of Gardner.&lt;ref name=of_mind&gt;[http://www.celebrationofmind.org/wordpress_site/?events=celebration-of-mind-with-colm-mulcahy Celebration of Mind with Colm Mulcahy]&lt;/ref&gt; These days there are over 100 of these latter events every year, all around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aperiodical.com/2012/10/who-wants-to-host-a-celebration-of-mind-theres-still-time/#more-5802 Who wants to host a Celebration of Mind?

Lisa Karen Savignano of Allgame wrote that the game was "exceptional" but that it had the potential to leave players endlessly frustrated.&lt;ref name="Conn-Allgame"/&gt; GameZone's Craig Majaski thought the game would appeal to players who had enjoyed ''[[Myst]]'' or ''[[Return to Zork]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204173012/http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/connect.htm|title=Connections|date=2008-12-04|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, The AV Club contributor Brian Clair said the game succeeded as a learning tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001029123649/http://www.avault.com:80/reviews/review_temp.asp?game=connection&amp;page=2|title=The Adrenaline Vault {{!}} Review {{!}} Connections|date=2000-10-29|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacWorld's George and Ben Beekman thoguht the game was well below the industry standard for the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990420055232/http://macworld.zdnet.com:80/pages/august.96/Reviews.2297.html|title=Review: Connections|date=1999-04-20|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entertainment Weekly thoguht the game was a missed opportunity; instead of being interesting and unique it was merely "Myst with a twist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427114258/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291854,00.html|title=Digital Review {{!}} Entertainment Weekly|date=2009-04-27|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Consejo Nacional de Fomento Educativo''' ("National Council for Education Development", CONAFE) is an institution under [[Mexico]]'s [[Government of Mexico|Federal Government]] created by presidential decree on 9 September 1971. Its responsibilities are to research, design, implement, operate, and evaluate new educational programs that could increase the education levels among the Mexican population, and could solve the cultural and educational problems of Mexican society.

CONAFE's educational programs are designed to fit the needs, interests, practices, and overall context of students living in [[rural]] areas, in dispersed communities inhabited by migrant workers, peasant or [[indigenous populations]]. These are all marginalized communities living under the [[poverty line]]. 

==Education in indigenous communities==

CONAFE's initiative is to work with small communities with no access to education and which are unable to meet a [[Secretariat of Public Education|Ministry of Public Education]] (SEP) requirement regarding the minimum number of students to establish a federal or state school. The Ministry of Public Education requires a minimum of five students per [[educational stages|academic level]] to justify the funding, construction, and operation of a school. Most indigenous communities have fewer than 100 inhabitants, and meeting SEP’s requirement has most of the time not been possible. For this reason, indigenous communities have been denied access to education.

==PAEPI: Proposal of Educational Attention for Indigenous Population==
CONAFE’s work experience with indigenous communities can be traced back to its foundation in 1971. CONAFE then served indigenous and [[mestizo]] communities from the highlands and rural areas of the state of [[Guerrero]] with the same educational program. The project of designing and operating a specific educational program for indigenous communities started until 1994, called Proposal of Educational Attention for Indigenous Population (PAEPI). 
 
Three principles guided the creation of PAEPI’s framework:

#Each teacher has to speak the [[language]] spoken by the [[community]] where she/he is located, or at least she/he ought to speak a language from the same [[natural language|language]] family of the language spoken by the community.
# [[Literacy]] teaching is to take place in the students’ first language.
# The culture of each community ought to be a guiding principle in the coursework.
By 2005, positive empirical results of PAEPI were already visible in 22 of the 31 [[Political divisions of Mexico#States|Mexican states]]. CONAFE granted PAEPI full status as a Program, changing its [[acronym]] to MAEPI, which stands for Modality of Educational Attention for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] Population.

==MAEPI: Modality of Educational Attention for Indigenous Population== 

MAEPI operates its primary education program in indigenous communities of less than 100 inhabitants and its [[preschool]] program with populations with less than 500 inhabitants. 

Indigenous teenagers and young adults are recruited by MAEPI to serve as Community Instructors in marginalized and isolated communities for a period of one or two years. During this period they are hosted and fed by the community where they are located. They also receive a monthly stipend to help them meet their basic needs. Once they finish their one year service as Community Instructors, they receive a monthly [[scholarship]] over a period of 30 months. 
Those who completed a 2-years service get the scholarship during a period of 60 months. 

Community Instructors are between 14 and 25 years old. They must have completed their [[secondary school]] degree in order to be eligible for a Community Instructor position. CONAFE targets specifically this group age since our main goal is to encourage students to continue their studies by making it a real and affordable possibility.

Today, 3,722 communities and 30,000 students are benefited by MAEPI.

There are three major action areas involved in MAEPI: 
#the training of Community Instructors
#the design and operation of basic education programs
#the production of didactic materials. The general characteristics of these areas are explained below.

===Training of Community Instructors===

There are two different training processes that help instructors to develop abilities for their performance as [[teacher]]s in the indigenous communities. The first one is the Initial Training. It is offered before the start of the school year, during a period of intensive daily training sessions that last over one month. The second one is the Permanent Training that takes place in monthly meetings where Community Instructors get together with other key actors involved in the educational program, such as Tutors, Educational Assistants, Academic or Regional Coordinators and other staff members. These meetings are held for people to exchange thoughts and feelings about their experience in the communities, the problems and obstacles they have faced, the strategies they have implemented to solve them, and the needs they have found and demand attention. Each actor has specific objectives to meet at these meetings according to their responsibilities.

The training covers three fields: [[Education]], [[Linguistic Research]] and Workshop, and [[Technology]]. Instructors are trained to understand and apply the educational principles and methodology of MAEPI. They are also introduced to linguistic analysis and exercises that can help them create a practical alphabet of their own language. Instructors are also taught how to use technological devises such as [[computer]]s, [[Image scanner|scanner]]s, [[Computer printer|printers]], [[digital camera]]s and sound recorders, software ([[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]], [[Inspiration (computer program)|Inspiration]]), and the [[Internet]].

===Design of Basic Education Programs===

The main goal of CONAFE’s educational programs for indigenous people is to turn the school into a space owned by the community where people can recreate and develop their language and [[culture]]; where a meaningful and useful exchange of knowledge, beliefs, traditions can take place with people coming from closer or faraway places and with similar or different cultures; where modern technologies can be used to improve the people’s life quality. 

Community Instructors are trained to follow a practical educational methodology in the classrooms. This methodology consists of three different stages:

*'''Problematization.'''
Students learn to identify relevant topics, they learn to problematize what they already know and think about issues related to the main theme. They identify what they do not know about it, and what sources they can consult to look for further information. Students learn to create an agenda and to plan the activities for their research project. When students have access to communication and computer technology, they can use several software to elaborate their work plan or conceptual maps. The Internet can be used as a source of information.

*'''Research.'''
Students develop skills to study on their own, and to identify, to choose, and to make use of different useful sources of information. Sources can be books and other written material, as well as people’s oral testimonies, stories, and opinions about a specific issue. Computer technology can be used to document the activities in the research processes, and to store images and sound recordings. 
 
*'''Organization and socialization of the learning process.'''
Due to the multilevel character of MAEPI courses, one of the guiding principles of the course is that students learn to play the role of experts, teachers, and coordinators when circumstances demand it.
 
===Participation in the Class===

Adults and children may learn together in the same classroom, as well as students with different ages and at different school levels; students who only speak an indigenous language work together with bilingual students who speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and an [[indigenous language]].

On one hand, students learn to listen and respect the person in charge of an activity, an exposition, a class presentation, or a project. This person will not always be the Community Instructor, since every person in the community or in the classroom can have that role. 

On the other hand, students also learn to communicate what they know and what they have learned, they learn to lead a class presentation or discussion, to present a community campaign, to spread information. 

Instructors can use several software to make follow-ups of the group’s and students’ participation. They can use email to communicate and coordinate tasks and activities with other instructors, coordinators, and other actors involved in MAEPI. Instructors and students may also create websites to publish their work, and to discover the work of other students in the different regions where MAEPI reaches out. Students design and produce posters, cards, flyers, for events, meetings and other activities in their communities. 

===Production of Didactic Material===

There is a wide diversity of indigenous languages and variant dialects in [[Mexico]] and in the communities where MAEPI operates. 

Given that the production and publishing of books in some of the most widely spoken indigenous languages would miss the educational purposes of MAEPI, namely to offer quality education in the first language of every group of students, MAEPI has encouraged Community Instructors and students to create their own didactic materials using their own language, their imagination and creative skills. 

===Bilingual materials===

To pursue this goal, MAEPI has strived to:

#Raise awareness among students and Community Instructors about the richness and potentialities of their language.
#Have Community Instructors develop basic writing and reading skills in the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] language that they speak.
#Design tools to systematize the community’s knowledge to draw from this information the topics and contents of the didactic material (filing cards, journals, etc.)

Each MAEPI school has made [[bilingual]], handwritten material in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and in indigenous languages. This material keeps growing year by year. In addition, MAEPI schools are provided with the Spanish written books that the Ministry of Public Education (SEP) distributes at the national level.

In this way, MAEPI instructors and students not only learn to read and write, they learn how to create their own means of communication and expression, they develop skills to think and to imagine them, to define their purpose, to choose meaningful educational contents, to present the information in the most appropriate way, and to create a format that fits the purposes. Community Instructors and students learn how to use different sources of information, and at the same time, they become informants of their own culture, language and knowledge.

===CECMI: The Community Education Center ===

Since 1994, MAEPI designed and operated preschool and primary educational programs. Creating a secondary program for young students, as well as primary and secondary program for adults soon became a visible need of the communities where MAEPI operated. These programs began to be designed and piloted in 2002, along with a program of Initial Education directed to pregnant women and mothers of under 3-years old children.

The Community Education Center emerged as a strategy to simultaneously offer all education programs (preschool, primary and secondary school for young and adult population, and initial education) in MAEPI schools with at least 8 students. Only Community Instructors with 1 year experience with MAEPI are trained to manage a multilevel class of this kind. A class of each Community Instructor should not exceed the limit of 15 students.

According to the Educational Proposal, each CECMI needs to have a [[library]], [[computer lab]], materials for [[workshop]]s, [[artistic]] and [[cultural]] activities, and the development of [[bilingualism]].

The CECMI project intends

*to increase community members participation in the educational programs.
*to enable students, specially [[women]], who graduated from MAEPI primary courses to continue with their [[secondary schooling]].
*to close the educational gap between the mestizo and the indigenous population .
*to promote the introduction of communication and information technology in the Indigenous Education.
*to encourage communities´ active involvement in the development of sustainable education projects in the indigenous contexts.

Today there are 136 working Community Education Centers in [[Mexico]].	

CONAFE’s goals are to turn every MAEPI school into a CECMI and to have a Community Computer Lab (CCD) in each of them.

CONAFE and the [[National Commission for the Development of the Indigenous People]] (CDI) have signed the agreement to pour US$3,400,000 into the construction of classrooms and the acquisition of computer equipment during the term 2006-2007. With these resources CECMIs and CCDs will be built in Mexico’s fifty municipalities with the lowest well-being standards. It is expected that through this kind of agreements, all communities assisted by MAEPI will have the chance to have a classroom of their own and a computer lab to make use of for the development of their own community.

Haggag's work has been praised in [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vogue.com/article/deana-haggag-united-states-artists-takes-on-trump|title=Meet the Woman Leading the Fight to Protect the Arts in Trump's America|work=Vogue|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Culture Magazine|Cultured Magazine]], [[Artspace]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artspace.com/magazine/interviews_features/qa/deana-haggag-on-why-funding-american-artists-really-means-dismantling-the-disgusting-rhetoric-of-54706|title=Deana Haggag on How Funding Artists "Dismantles the Disgusting Rhetoric" of the (NEA-Less) Trump Administration|website=Artspace|language=en|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyperallergic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/98142/being-contemporary-in-baltimore/|title=Being Contemporary in Baltimore|date=2013-12-12|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other publications. At [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Rebecca Bengal]] praised Haggag's role in national efforts to protect arts funding:

{{quote|text=As arts funding faces a devastating blow, it's an ominous time to be an artist or to take a leading role in nonprofit fundraising, but it's also a time when the arts need a fresh kind of fire, something that Haggag embodies with passionate devotion and an approach that feels both thoughtful and innovative. At 30, she is considerably younger than most of her peers, coming off a career largely focused on curating in New York City, Cairo, and Baltimore, where she most recently headed the traveling museum The Contemporary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;}}

'''Eduard Philip (Ed) Spanjaard''' (born 22 December 1948 in [[Haarlem]]) is a Dutch [[Conducting|conductor]] and [[pianist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamreinert.com/artist.php?id=spanjaard|title=Ed Spanjaard|publisher=William Reinert Associates|accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kv-artists.nl/index.php?p=Ed+Spanjaard&amp;pi=138|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302003518/http://www.kv-artists.nl/index.php?p=Ed+Spanjaard&amp;pi=138|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 March 2012|title=Ed Spanjaard|publisher=Interartists Amsterdam|accessdate=30 December 2009}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ed Spanjaard’s father was a psychiatrist and amateur pianist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vpro.nl/programma/vrijegeluiden/afleveringen/24307146/items/24309644/|title=Het China festival, dirigent Ed Spanjaard, het Rubens kwartet en de taoisten van Shanxi|work=Vrije geluiden|author=Hans Flupsen|date=2005-10-02|accessdate=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother a flutist and music teacher. Spanjaard studied at the [[Conservatorium van Amsterdam|Conservatorium van de Vereniging Muzieklyceum]] at [[Amsterdam]] and afterwards at the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] in London. During his studies he was, next to conductor of amateur ensembles like the Leids Studenten Kamer Orkest (LeSKO), assistant of [[Bernard Haitink]], [[Georg Solti|George Solti]] and [[Herbert von Karajan]].

==Career==
In London he worked as [[répétiteur]] of the Royal Opera [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]]. In 1978 he conducted the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''Così fan tutte'' during the [[Glyndebourne Festival]]. In 1980 and 1981 he was assistant-conductor to Herbert von Karajan at the [[Salzburger Festspiele]]. For the [[Bayreuther Festspiele]] in 1983 he was the assistant of George Solti in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring des Nibelungen]]'', which laid the foundation for his work in the opera.
For several years he was principal guest conductor of the Nederlands Balletorkest and the [[Limburgs Symfonie Orkest]] (LSO) (1982–1988), and has directed almost all Dutch orchestras. Since 1982 Spanjaard has been principal conductor of the [[Nieuw Ensemble]], which was awarded the [[Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds|Prins Bernardfonds muziekprijs]] in 1998.
As guest conductor he performed all over the world. The last years Spanjaard worked as conductor in the contemporary and classical repertoire. In the Netherlands he directed [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'' with the [[De Nederlandse Opera]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' and Verdi's ''[[Don Carlos]]'' with the Nationale Reisopera and with the Opera Zuid [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[La Bohème]]'' and ''[[Madame Butterfly]]'' as well as [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Humperdinck]]'s ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]''. Also with the [[Residentie Orchestra|Residentie Orkest]] and abroad (Canada) he made several opera productions. In 2000 at the Rotterdam Ahoy he conducted the Nederlands Balletorkest in Verdi's ''La Traviata'' and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]'s ''Peter Grimes'' with the Nationale Reisopera. He premiered the chamber-operas Wolf Cub Village and Night Banquet from the Chinese composer [[Guo Wenjing]] with the New Ensemble. Beginning 2004 he was invited by the opera of Lyon to conduct the opera ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélissande]]'' from [[Claude Debussy]].

During a state visit of [[Queen Beatrix]] in 1995 he conducted [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s ''Lieder aus Des Knaben Wunderhorn'' and ''[[Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)|symphony No. 1]]'' in cooperation with the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]]. He regularly performs with the [[Ensemble InterContemporain]] in Paris and with the [[Klangforum Wien]]. In 2000 he conducted the [[Ensemble Modern]] in Frankfurt am Main, with great success which was praised by the press. In February 2002 Spanjaard took care of the musical accompaniment for the wedding of [[Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange|Prince Willem-Alexander]] and [[Princess Máxima of the Netherlands|Máxima Zorreguieta]]. She was particularly moved by [[Adiós Nonino]] from ''[[Ástor Piazzolla]]'' with [[Carel Kraayenhof]] on [[bandoneón]]. The success of the performance led to another CD-recording with the same performers including the Concertgebouw Kamerorkest and the Nederlands Kamerkoor.

Since August 2001 Ed Spanjaard was appointed chief conductor of the Limburgs Symfonie Orkest. Together with the LSO he performed [[Hans Zender]]'s composed interpretation of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s ''[[Winterreise]]'' in September 2003 during the Musica Sacra festival in [[Maastricht]]. This performance received praise of the national press and was considered the highlight of the festival. Also a CD-recording of the LSO and the Nederlands Kamerkoor with compositions by [[Gabriel Fauré]] was greatly valued.

In 2009 Ed Spanjaard conducted ''[[Das Rheingold]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/kunst/article1294753.ece/Rheingold_klinkt_als_een_klok|title=Rheingold klinkt als een klok|work=De Volkskrant|author=Roland de Beer|date=27 September 2009|accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.8weekly.nl/artikel/7709/richard-wagner-das-rheingold.html|title=Wachten op de trein naar het Walhalla|work=8weekly.nl|author=Henri Drost|date=28 September 2009|accessdate=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring des Nibelungen]]'' with the [[Nationale Reisopera]] and [[Orkest van het Oosten]] in [[Enschede|Enschedé]] where in 2010 he conducted ''[[Die Walküre]]''.

The '''Eduardo Mondlane University''' ({{lang-pt|Universidade Eduardo Mondlane}}; UEM) is the oldest and largest [[university]] in [[Mozambique]]. The '''UEM''' is located in [[Maputo]] and has about 40,000 students enrolled. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UEM em números - 2015|url=http://uem.mz/index.php/uem-em-numeros-2015|website=Universidade Eduardo Mondlane|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
[[File:Universidade Eduardo Mondlane.jpg|thumb|Eduardo Mondlane University]]
The institution was set up as a center for higher education in 1962 in what was then [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]], the capital of [[Portugal]]'s [[overseas province of Mozambique]]. Founded by the time of [[Ministry of the Overseas (Portugal)|Overseas Minister]] [[Adriano Moreira]], it was called ''Estudos Gerais Universitários de Moçambique'' (Mozambique General University Studies)&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; after ''[[Studium Generale]]''; in 1968 it became the '''Universidade de Lourenço Marques''' (University of Lourenço Marques).&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uem.mz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=42|website=uem.mz|title=History of Eduardo Mondlane University|accessdate=11 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303183546/http://www.uem.mz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=42|archivedate=3 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Mozambique became [[History of Mozambique#Independence|independent]] in 1975, the city was renamed "Maputo" and the university was renamed in honor of [[Frelimo]] leader [[Eduardo Mondlane]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

==Student enrolment==
All students at the Universidade Eduardo Mondlane are full-time, contact students. As of 2015, the university consists of around 40,000 students, of which around 3,300 are pursuing postgraduate courses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UEM em Números - 2015|url=http://uem.mz/index.php/uem-em-numeros-2015|website=Universidade Eduardo Mondlane|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the quality of the public schools is also higher compared to the private schools, in terms of "educational and labour market outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url =  http://ftp.iza.org/dp3222.pdf |title = Private School Quality in Italy | format = pdf | language = en | first = Giuseppe | last = Bertola | first2 = Daniele | last2 = Checchi  | first3 = Veruska | last3 = Oppedisano  | journal =  Discussion Paper Series | number = IZA DP No. 3222 | publisher = [[IZA Institute of Labor Economics]] | date = December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In Italy a state school system or Education System has existed since 1859, when the Legge Casati (Casati Act) mandated educational responsibilities for the forthcoming Italian state ([[Italian Unification|Italian unification]] took place in 1861).
The Casati Act made primary education compulsory, and had the goal of increasing [[literacy]]. This law gave control of primary education to the single towns, of secondary education to the [[Provinces of Italy|provinces]], and the universities were managed by the State.
Even with the Casati Act and compulsory education, in rural (and southern) areas children often were not sent to school (the rate of children enrolled in primary education would reach 90% only after 70 years) and the illiteracy rate (which was nearly 80% in 1861) took more than 50 years to halve.

The next important law concerning the Italian education system was the ''[[Legge Gentile]]''. This act was issued in 1923, thus when [[Benito Mussolini]] and his [[National Fascist Party]] were in power. In fact, [[Giovanni Gentile]] was appointed the task of creating an education system deemed fit for the fascist system. The compulsory age of education was raised to 14 years, and was somewhat based on a ladder system: after the first five years of primary education, one could choose the 'Scuola media', which would give further access to the "liceo" and other secondary education, or the 'avviamento al lavoro' (work training), which was intended to give a quick entry into the low strates of the workforce.
The reform enhanced the role of the ''Liceo Classico'', created by the Casati Act in 1859 (and intended during the Fascist era as the peak of secondary education, with the goal of forming the future upper classes), and created the Technical, Commercial and Industrial institutes and the ''Liceo Scientifico''.
The ''Liceo Classico'' was the only secondary school that gave access to all types of higher education until 1968.
The influence of Gentile's [[Idealism]] was great,&lt;ref&gt;Moss, M. E. (2004). ''Mussolini's fascist philosopher: Giovanni Gentile reconsidered''. New York: P. Lang.pp 26–73.&lt;/ref&gt; and he considered the Catholic religion to be the "fundament and crowning" of education.
In 1962 the 'avviamento al lavoro' was abolished, and all children until 14 years had to follow a single program, encompassing primary education (''scuola elementare'') and middle school (''scuola media'').

From 1962 to the present day, the main structure of Italian primary (and secondary) education remained largely unchanged, even if some modifications were made: a narrowing of the gap between males and females (through the merging of the two distinct programmes for ''technical education'', and the optional introduction of mixed-gender gym classes), a change in the structure of secondary school (''legge Berlinguer'') and the creation of new ''licei'', 'istituti tecnici' and 'istituti professionali', giving the student more choices in their paths.

In 1999, in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the [[Bologna Process]], the Italian university system switched from the old system (''vecchio ordinamento'', which led to the traditional 5-year ''Laurea'' degree), to the new system (''nuovo ordinamento'').  The ''nuovo ordinamento'' split the former ''Laurea'' into two tracks: the ''Laurea triennale'' (a three-year degree akin to the [[Bachelor's Degree]]), followed by the 2-year ''Laurea specialistica'' (Master's Degree), the latter renamed ''Laurea Magistrale'' in 2007.  A credit system was established to quantify the amount of work needed by each course and exam (25 work hours = 1 credit), as well as enhance the possibility to change course of studies and facilitate the transfer of credits for further studies or go on exchange (e.g. [[Erasmus Programme]]) in another country. However, it is now established that there is just a five-year degree "Laurea Magistrale a Ciclo Unico" for programmes such as Law and a six-year degree for Medicine.

==Primary education==
[[File:Ecole Variney.JPG|thumb|right|An elementary school in [[Aosta Valley]], with the name both in Italian and French]]
''Scuola primaria'' (primary school), also known as ''scuola elementare'', is commonly preceded by three years of non-compulsory nursery school (or kindergarten, "asilo"). ''Scuola elementare'' lasts five years. Until middle school, the educational curriculum is the same for all pupils: although one can attend a private or state-funded school, the subjects studied are the same (with the exception of special schools for the blind or the hearing-impaired). The students are given a basic education in Italian, English, mathematics, natural sciences, history, geography, social studies, and physical education. Some schools also have Spanish or French, musical arts and visual arts.

Until 2004, pupils had to pass an exam to access ''Scuola secondaria di primo grado'' (Middle school), comprising the composition of a short essay in Italian, a written math test, and an oral test on the other subjects. The exam has been discontinued and pupils can now enter ''Scuola secondaria di Primo Grado'' directly.

Usually students start Primary School at the age of 6, but students who are born between January and March and are still 5 years old can access primary school early; this is called ''Primina''. For example, a student born in February 2002 can attend primary school with students born in 2001.

==Secondary education==
[[File:Lodi Ist Tecnico Bassi.JPG|thumb|right|A high school in [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]], the Istituto tecnico economico Agostino Bassi.]]
{{see also|Secondary education in Italy}}
[[File:Cattedrale yard and the Liceo Classico V. Emanuele II, Palermo, Sicily, Italy (9459287440).jpg|thumb|A high school in [[Palermo]], the Liceo classico Vittorio Emanuele II, right next to the [[Palermo Cathedral]]]]
Secondary education in Italy lasts 8 years and is divided in two stages: ''Scuola secondaria di primo grado'' (Lower secondary school), also broadly known as ''Scuola media'', which corresponds to the Middle School grades, and ''Scuola secondaria di secondo grado'' (Upper secondary school), also broadly known as ''Scuola superiore'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dizionari.corriere.it/dizionario_italiano/L/liceo.shtml|title=liceo|last=|first=|date=|website=dizionari.corriere.it|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to the high-school level.

The ''Scuola secondaria di primo grado'' lasts three years (roughly from age 11 to 14).

The ''Scuola secondaria di secondo grado'' lasts five years (roughly from age 14 to 19). Every tier involves an exam at the end of the final year, called ''[[Maturità|esame di maturità]]'', required to gain a degree and have access to further university education.

While students in lower secondary school stay in their classroom for most of the time (during physical education they go to the gym for example), in high school they will be the one to move from the classroom to the laboratory, but the teacher still has to move from one classroom to another if the lesson is not held in a laboratory.

In the lower middle school pupils start school at 8:30 AM and finish at 1:30 PM (Although they can start later, they always have to attend school for at least five hours, with some differences based on the days they attend), while for high school, depending on the school, they attend school 5 to 8 hours a day based on the day of the week and the exact choice of school.
Most schools have 10 minutes of recess, although high school students have 15 to 30 minutes depending on how long the day is.

For historical reasons, there are three types of ''Scuola secondaria di secondo grado'', subsequently divided into further specialization. Currently all of the secondary schools in Italy have most of the structure and subjects in common for the first two years (''Primo biennio'')(such as Italian grammar, history and mathematics),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsussidiario.net/News/Educazione/2010/5/18/SCUOLA-Liceo-o-istituto-tecnico-non-fatevi-ingannare-dal-mito-della-cultura-/86788/|title=SCUOLA/ Liceo o istituto tecnico, non fatevi ingannare dal mito della 'cultura'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the last three years(''Secondo biennio e quinto anno,'' or ''triennio'') most subjects are peculiar to a particular type of course (i.e. [[ancient Greek]] in the Liceo Classico, [[business economics]] in the Istituto tecnico economico or [[scenography]] in the Liceo Artistico) but subjects like Italian, English and mathematics are still taught.:
*'''[[Liceo (Italian school)|Liceo]]''' (lyceum), the education received in a ''Liceo'' is mostly theoretical, with a specialization in a specific field of studies (humanities, science, or art).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivio.pubblica.istruzione.it/riforma_superiori/nuovesuperiori/doc/Allegato_A_definitivo_02012010.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Allegato A definitivo 02012010.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Istituto tecnico]]''' (technical institute), the education given in an ''Istituto tecnico'' offers both a wide theoretical education and a specialization in a specific field of studies (e.g.: economy, humanities, administration, law, technology, tourism), often integrated with a three/six months [[internship]] in a company, association or university, from the third to the fifth and last year of study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majoranadigitale.it/doc/documentazione/Linee_guida_Istituti_Tecnici_secondo_biennio_e_quinto_anno.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Istituto professionale]]''' (professional institute), this type of school offers a form of secondary education oriented towards practical subjects (engineering, agriculture, gastronomy, technical assistance, handicrafts), and enables the students to start searching for a job as soon as they have completed their studies, sometimes sooner, as some schools offer a diploma after three years instead of five, although it is considered a lower level of school compared to the others.

Any type of secondary school that lasts 5 years grants access to the final exam, called ''esame di maturità'' or ''esame di stato''; this exam takes place every year between June and July and grants access to university.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.istruzione.it/esame_di_stato/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[OECD]], ranks the Italian secondary education as the 21st in the world, above the United States and in the OECD average,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourtimes.wordpress.com/2008/04/10/oecd-education-rankings/|title=OECD Education Rankings –&amp;nbsp;2013 Update|date=10 April 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observes a wide gap between results in [[northern Italy|Northern Italian]] schools, which performed significantly better than the national average (among the best in the world in some subjects),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results-overview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] schools, that had much poorer results. Moreover, students in state-owned schools perform better than students in private schools. An Italian student is 19 when they enter university, while in other countries 18 is the more common age.

==Higher education==
[[File:The Archiginnasio, Bologna, Italy, the wing with the Anatomical theatre.JPG|thumb|right|The [[University of Bologna]] ("[[Archiginnasio of Bologna|Archiginnasio]]"), the world's oldest university, founded in 1088]]
{{see also|Higher education in Italy|List of universities in Italy}}
Italy has a large and international network of public and state affiliated [[university|universities]] and schools offering degrees in higher education. State-run universities of Italy constitute the main percentage of tertiary education in Italy, and are managed under the supervision of Italian's Ministry of Education.

Italian universities are among the oldest universities in the world. In particular the [[University of Bologna]] (founded in 1088), [[University of Padua]], founded in 1222, and the [[University of Naples Federico II]], the oldest public and laic university in the world, are the oldest state universities in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kamp|first=Norbert|title=Federico II di Svevia, Imperatore, Re di Sicilia e di Gerusalemme, Re dei Romani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclo[[University of Naples Federico II|University of Naples]]pedia/federico-ii-di-svevia-imperatore-re-di-sicilia-e-di-gerusalemme-re-dei-romani_(Federiciana)|publisher=Treccani|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cenni Storici|url=http://www.unina.it/ateneo/cenni/index.jsp|publisher=Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II|accessdate=28 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928175347/http://www.unina.it/ateneo/cenni/index.jsp|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most universities in Italy are state-supported.

There are also a number of [[Superior Graduate Schools in Italy|Superior Graduate Schools]] (''[[Grandes écoles]]'')&lt;ref name="ricercaitaliana.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricercaitaliana.it/scuole_eccellenza.htm|title=Pagina di transizione|website=ricercaitaliana.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Scuola Superiore Universitaria'', offer officially recognized titles, including the ''Diploma di Perfezionamento'' equivalent to a [[Doctorate]], [[Dottorato di ricerca|''Dottorato di Ricerca'']] i.e. [[Doctorate|Research Doctorate]] or ''Doctor Philosophiae'' i.e. [[Ph.D]].&lt;ref name="istruzione.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istruzione.it/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/8efd760c-b779-4716-9566-2338ddff59e1/07_allegato_4_equipollenze_perfezionamenti_e_dottorati.pdf|title=Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) Decree|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them also organize courses [[Master's degree]]. There are three Superior Graduate Schools with "university status", three institutes with the status of Doctoral Colleges, which function at [[Graduate school|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] level. Nine further schools are direct offshoots of the universities (i.e. do not have their own 'university status'). The first one is the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] (founded in 1810 by [[Napoleon]] as a branch of [[École Normale Supérieure]]), taking the model of organization from the famous [[École Normale Supérieure]]. These institutions are commonly referred to as "Schools of Excellence" (i.e. "Scuole di Eccellenza").&lt;ref name="ricercaitaliana.it"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scuole di Eccellenza"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scuoledieccellenza.it/|title=Scuole - Scuole di Eccellenza|website=scuoledieccellenza.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy hosts a broad variety of universities, colleges and academies. Founded in 1088, the [[University of Bologna]] is likely the oldest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/universit-di-bologna-oldest-university-in-the-world/ |title=Università di Bologna (oldest university in the world) |publisher=Virtual Globetrotting |date=21 October 2006 |accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the University of Bologna is, according to [[Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings|The Times]], the only Italian college in the top 200 World Universities. Milan's [[Bocconi University]] has been ranked among the top 20 best [[business school]]s in the world by [[The Wall Street Journal]] international rankings, especially thanks to its [[M.B.A.]] program, which in 2007 placed it no. 17 in the world in terms of graduate recruitment preference by major multinational companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mba.sdabocconi.it/home/main.php?id=12001&amp;ym=2007-09 |title=Conferenze, ospiti, news ed eventi legati agli MBA della SDA Bocconi – MBA SDA Bocconi |publisher=SDA Bocconi |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bocconi was also ranked by [[Forbes]] as the best worldwide in the specific category Value for Money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oie.gatech.edu/sa/programs/show.html?id=bocc |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508020611/http://www.oie.gatech.edu/sa/programs/show.html?id=bocc |archivedate=8 May 2008 |title=Gatech :: OIE :: GT Study Abroad Programs |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, Bocconi overtook several traditionally top global business schools in the [[Financial Times]] [[Executive education]] ranking, reaching no. 5 in Europe and no. 15 in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/vivimilano/cronache/articoli/2008/05_Maggio/12/sda_bocconi.shtml |title=Sda Bocconi supera London Business School – ViviMilano |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=30 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924222100/http://www.corriere.it/vivimilano/cronache/articoli/2008/05_Maggio/12/sda_bocconi.shtml |archivedate=24 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other top universities and polytechnics include the [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]] in [[Milan]], the [[LUISS]] in [[Rome]], the [[Polytechnic University of Turin]], the [[Politecnico di Milano]] (which in 2011 was ranked as the 48th best technical university in the world by [[QS World University Rankings]]&lt;ref name=qs1&gt;{{cite web|title=Politecnico di Milano – QS World University Rankings|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/politecnico-di-milano|publisher=topuniversities.com|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome La Sapienza]] (which in 2005 was Europe's 33rd best university,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arwu.org/rank/2005/ARWU2005_TopEuro.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430202044/http://www.arwu.org/rank/2005/ARWU2005_TopEuro.htm|archivedate=30 April 2008 |title=Top 100 European Universities |publisher=Arwu.org |accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ranks among Europe's 50 and the world's 150 best colleges&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_TopEuro(EN).htm |title=ARWU2008 |publisher=Arwu.org |accessdate=27 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822033350/http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_TopEuro(EN).htm |archivedate=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013, the Center for World University Rankings ranked the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] 62nd in the world and the top in Italy in its ''World University Rankings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwur.org/top100.html|title=http://cwur.org/top100.html|publisher=Center for World University Rankings| year=2013 |accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[University of Milan]] (whose research and teaching activities have developed over the years and have received important international recognition). The University is the only Italian member of the League of European Research Universities (LERU), a prestigious group of twenty research-intensive European Universities. It has also been awarded ranking positions such as 1st in Italy and 7th in Europe (The [[CWTS Leiden Ranking|Leiden Ranking]] – Universiteit Leiden).

According to National Science Indicators (1981–2002), a database produced by Research Services Group containing listings of output and citation statistics for more than 90 countries, Italy has an above-average output of [[scientific paper]]s (in terms of number of papers written with at least one author being from Italy) in [[space science]] (9.75% of papers in the world being from Italy), [[mathematics]] (5.51% of papers in the world), [[computer science]], [[neurosciences]], and [[physics]]; the lowest, but still slightly above world-average, output in terms of number of papers produced is recorded in the [[social sciences]], [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]], and economics and business.&lt;ref name="sci"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nancy Imelda Schafer, ISI |url=http://in-cites.com/research/2003/june_9_2003-1.html |title=SCI-BYTES: Science in Italy, 1998–2002 |publisher=In-cites.com |accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Australian Worker|Social workers]] use [[education]] as a key tool in client and community interactions.
These educational exchanges are not always explicit but are the foundation of how social workers learn from their service participants and how social workers can assist with information delivery and skill development.

== Psychoeducation ==

One of the well-known ways in which social workers engage service participants
with valuable information is through [[psychoeducation]].&lt;ref name=Lukens&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lukens|first=E.P.|author2=McFarlane, W.R.|title=Psychoeducation as evidence-based practice: Considerations for practice, research, and policy|journal=Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention|year=2004|volume=4|issue=3|doi=10.1093/brief-treatment/mhh019|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Psychoeducation "reflects a paradigm shift to a more [[holistic]] and competence-based
approach, stressing health, collaboration, coping, and empowerment".&lt;ref name=Lukens /&gt; This method can be used
within individual and community wide interactions but consistently focuses on service
participant's strengths.&lt;ref name=Lukens /&gt; It is a model that allows the social
worker to provide the service participant with information necessary to make an informed
decision that will allow them to reach their respective goals.

== Education as a tool in community empowerment ==

Within the educational setting, social workers can provide valuable information
through Parent Universities (PU). [[Boston Public Schools|Boston Public School's]] (BPS) Focus on Children
Program facilitates a PU for parents of children in the school district.&lt;ref name=BPS&gt;{{cite web|last=Boston Public Schools|title=What is Parent University?|url=http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/parentuniversity|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; PU focuses
on child development, content children are learning in school, parent and child advocacy,
parental leadership and effective parenting skills.&lt;ref name="BPS" /&gt; The goal of the program
is to provide parents with information that is beneficial for their children's academic
success and their own personal and professional development.&lt;ref name="BPS" /&gt; These
classes are free to all parents with children in BPS and take place on select Saturdays
throughout the year.&lt;ref name="BPS" /&gt; A model such as this could be a great forum for social
workers, including school social workers, to work with parents in regards to their child's
academic needs.

Washtenaw Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights (WICIR) is an organization co-founded by [[University of Michigan]] social work professor, Laura Sanders and numerous other community volunteers.&lt;ref name=WICIR&gt;{{cite web|last=Washtenaw Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights|title=Take Action Now|url=http://wicir.com/index.html|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; WICIR has been instrumental in leading the immigrant rights campaign in Washtenaw County, [[Michigan]]. This organization developed a volunteer urgent response team in response to a brutal immigration raid in 2008.  It provides advocacy for families affected by increased immigration enforcement, Know Your Rights education to the immigrant community, ally education, and leads political actions toward local policy changes that affect immigrants and immigration reform.&lt;ref name="WICIR" /&gt;  Recently WICIR has provided training to empower immigrant community members to speak in public and to policy makers on behalf of policy reforms, advocate for the community and help other immigrant families. Educational materials and workshops are provided in both English and Spanish.&lt;ref name="WICIR" /&gt; WICIR's use of creative and empowering educational sessions, provide in both English and Spanish has allowed them to be inclusive and responsive the community's needs.

== Alternatives ==

The [[National Association of Social Workers|NASW]] Code of Ethics places emphasis on the importance of the Social
Work profession being sensitive, aware and culturally competent (1.05) while
building partnership with participants.&lt;ref name=NASW&gt;{{cite book|last=National Association of Social Workers|title=Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers|year=1996|publisher=Washington, DC.|location=Washington, DC.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of cultural competency is
being discussed; a new terminology suggests using cultural humility vs. cultural
competency.&lt;ref name=Tervalon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tervalon|first=M.|author2=Muray-Garcia, J.|title=Cultural Humility Versus Cultural Competency|journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved|year=1998|volume=9|issue=2|pages=117–125|doi=10.1353/hpu.2010.0233|pmid=10073197}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors suggest that cultural humility
is more sustainable and incorporates a lifelong commitment to self-evaluation
and growth. The importance of bringing this to attention right away is to highlight
that language use is extremely important when interacting with participants.
Checking our use of language as professionals have powerful impacts
on our relationships. Furthermore, our use of language can either perpetuate
hierarchy or help to minimize it. If our goal as Social Workers is to empower participants, minimizing hierarchy is one way to develop more meaningful and equal
relationships.

One way to limit hierarchy and [[cultural imperialism]] together is through
community or peoples education. This form of education differs from that of
dominant education by including voices that are frequently left out. This is
examined and explained in depth by the educator and philosopher Paulo Freire.
In his most influential book " Pedagogy of the Oppressed".&lt;ref name=Paulo&gt;{{cite book|last=Freire|first=Paulo|title=Pedagogy of the oppressed|year=1986|publisher=Continuum|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freire pioneered the
critical pedagogy movement. Rather than using a traditional top down approach
while educating, Freire believed in a bottom up approach.&lt;ref name="Paulo" /&gt; With this shift in power-
dynamics, educators including social workers will be more likely to realize the
strengths of the people they are working with, rather than assuming that as
professionals, we hold all the answers. This is extremely important for Social
Workers to be aware of, because this philosophy fosters empowerment. Our role as
Social Workers is not to simply provide services, but to help others develop positive
self-esteem.

Another example of this was [[Howard Zinn]]'s "A People's History of America".
Zinn believed that the dominant narrative being taught in schools was excluding
the voice and contributions of marginalized populations.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|title=A People's History of America|year=1995|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; While looking for ways to
incorporate people's education, one tool that exists is the Zinn Education Project.
On this website educators can find critical resources which focus on the voices of
oppressed and marginalized groups.  This website contains hundreds of resources
free of charge. Using tools such as this are beneficial for both the Social Worker and
the participant.

When facilitating or participating in education that challenges dominant narratives, it is
important to be aware of one's own social identity. Our identities are extremely
complex and intersect with various aspects of our [[ascribed status]] (one assigned to
you) and our achieved status (one that is "earned"). Reflecting and analyzing our
own identities and status can help us foster a deeper understanding and respect for
those around us. Being critical is an absolute necessity when engaging in alternative
narratives.

While facilitating or educating it is important to set the mood of the group.
This is usually done through having an icebreaker before beginning the educational
activity. This helps individuals warm up and get to know each other before
discussing difficult issues, such as ones that challenge the dominant narrative.
Many resources exist for icebreakers, but you can also develop your own based on
your education plan and the group you are working with. After the discussion it is
important to have some sort of closure for the group. Discussing alternatives to a
dominant narrative can be eye opening, empowering or uncomfortable for some.
It is beneficial to discuss how individuals are feeling so that you can tailor future
discussions to the needs of the group.

== Skills and tools for social workers that educate ==

Several organizations provide supplemental materials and guides for social work professionals that educate. Some of the most comprehensive resources are available from university social work departments and non-profit organizations. Some examples of this include the Council on Social Work Education and the [[State University of New York]] School of Social Work. The CSWE Gero-Ed Center lists a practice guide for social workers educating certain or audiences that includes class exercises, assignments, case studies, and history.

=== Council on Social Work Education ===

The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) is a non-profit association partnership of educational and professional institutions that works to ensure and enhance the quality of social work education and for a practice that promotes individual, family, and community well-being, and social and economic justice.&lt;ref name=CSWE&gt;{{cite web|last=Council on Social Work Education|title=Teaching Tools|url=http://www.cswe.org/CentersInitiatives/GeroEdCenter/TeachingTools.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association provides various training for community education in a social work setting.&lt;ref name=CSWE /&gt; For instance, the CSWE Gero-Ed Center lists a practice guide for social workers educating certain populations or audiences that includes class exercises, assignments, case studies, and competencies history.&lt;ref name=CSWE /&gt;

The material provided explains the benefits of each activity style and what a group would gain from its implementation. Many of the class exercises resemble community education events and are intended to provide insight into what educational styles may be best for the social worker's topic of interest or population.&lt;ref name=CSWE /&gt; A policy analysis at a community agency meeting may call for an educational activity that divides the attending into groups to advocate for the interests of other community members or agencies. This type of activity, as described by the CSWE, allows for free discussion of intergenerational, multicultural, political issues associated with that policy.&lt;ref name=CSWE /&gt; This tool is among many others the CSWE provides for social workers that educate.

=== The State University of New York School of Social Work ===

For social workers that are new to educating, the State University of New York School of Social Work provides a great resource that can help each educator find their own style of teaching. They explain that teaching is as much of an art and that social workers, as educators, needs to understand themselves and their students.&lt;ref name=Buffalo&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Buffalo|title=Teaching Resources|url=http://www.socialwork.buffalo.edu/facstaff/teaching.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the identified tools provided by the School of Social Work include finding one's own learning style, how to develop effective lesson plans, reflective teaching and professional development, resources by subject, and solution-focused teaching among others.&lt;ref name="Buffalo" /&gt;

Reflective teaching is one promoted aspect that describes the responsibility of the social worker to create an environment for creative problem solving. It allows for room to consider more alternatives and develop a body of knowledge based on experiences.&lt;ref name=Brazeau&gt;{{cite web|last=Brazeau|first=G|title=Reflection teaching: A valuable tool for teaching, learning and professional development|url=http://www.socialwork.buffalo.edu/facstaff/documents/Reflection_Teaching_Brazeau-06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the social work setting this attempt to community education can prove to be most effective as our environments and populations are constantly changing. Reflecting and monitoring the educational process can help to stabilize more creative and innovative ways to educate individuals, families, and communities.&lt;ref name=Brazeau /&gt; As social and economic justice issues become more prominent and delicate, social workers need to consider these tools for the benefit of help seekers.

[[Image:Logo unihd.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white logo of the Heidelberg Center for Latin America.|Heidelberg Center for Latin America]]
The '''Heidelberg Center for Latin America''' ({{lang-es|Heidelberg Center para América Latina}}; {{lang-de|Heidelberg Center Lateinamerika}}) is a [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] institute in [[Santiago de Chile]] affiliated with [[Heidelberg University]]. It was founded in 2001 and officially opened on 9 April 2002. It is the only European-affiliated university in [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los 10 años de trabajo de la Universidad de Heidelberg en Chile|url=http://www.lanacion.cl/los-10-anos-de-trabajo-de-la-universidad-de-heidelberg-en-chile/noticias/2012-09-13/192640.html|accessdate=10 July 2015|work=[[La Nación (Chile)|La Nación]]|date=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has the task of organising, managing and marketing the courses of study maintained either independently by Heidelberg University or in co-operation with the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] and the [[University of Chile]].  Heidelberg University has arranged co-operation agreements with both of these universities, the two most important universities in Chile.  The centre also has responsibility for programmes of further training.  This initiative enables Heidelberg University to pursue its aims of passing on the accumulated knowledge of German research and teaching and to promote scientific co-operation between [[Germany]] and [[Latin America]].  The centre co-ordinates the activities of Heidelberg University in Latin America and provides a platform for scientific co-operation.

The centre is financially supported in these early years by [[Baden-Württemberg]] State Ministry for Science, Research and Art, Heidelberg University and the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD).  The Heidelberg Latin America Centre is run as a society subject to [[Chilean Civil Code|Chilean civil law]].  Its partners are Heidelberg University, with its corporate funds, and the [[Unterländer]] study fund, a public law foundation.

[[File:HFSP logo.png|thumb|HFSP logo]]
'''The Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP)''' (Frontière humaine, in French) is a program, based in [[Strasbourg]],  [[France]], that funds basic research in life sciences. HFSP is supported by 13 countries and the [[European Union]]. [[Nobutaka Hirokawa]] has been its President and Chair of the Board of Trustees since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsp.org/about-us/press-and-media-centre/news-items/professor-nobutaka-hirokawa-elected-president-hfspo|title=Professor Nobutaka Hirokawa elected as President of HFSPO - Human Frontier Science Program|website=www.hfsp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1986 a feasibility study was carried out by leading Japanese scientists under the auspices of the Japanese Prime Minister's Council for Science of Technology, to explore possible means to encourage international collaboration in basic research.  Discussion was expanded to include scientists from the [[G8|G7]] summit nations and the European Union, resulting in the "London Wise Men's Conference" in April 1987, which endorsed the suggestion.  Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] of Japan proposed the Human Frontier Science Program at the [[13th G7 summit|Venice Economic Summit]] in June 1987. The Economic Summit partners and the Chairman of the European Community welcomed the initiative and activities aimed at implementing it were started.  The implementing body, the International Human Frontier Science Program Organization (HFSPO) was established in 1989 and the secretariat was founded in [[Strasbourg, France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsp.org/about-us/history|title=History - Human Frontier Science Program|website=www.hfsp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1990, more than 6000 awards have been made to researchers from over 70 countries. &lt;!-- as of 2014 --&gt;&lt;ref name="annual2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsp.org/sites/www.hfsp.org/files/Annual%20Report%20FY%202014.pdf|title=Annual report 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=awardees&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsp.org/awardees/awards-archive|title=Awards Archive - Human Frontier Science Program|website=www.hfsp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of these, 25 HFSP awardees have gone on to win the [[Nobel Prize]] for their scientific work.&lt;ref name="annual2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsp.org/awardees/hfsp-goes-nobel|title=HFSP and the Nobel Prize - Human Frontier Science Program|website=www.hfsp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
[[Image:Human Frontier Science Program.png|thumb|right|401px|{{legend|#007f00|contributing member states}}
{{legend|#00ff00|European Union contribution}}]]

HFSPO receives financial support from the governments or research councils of [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Republic of Korea]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[United States of America|USA]], as well as from the [[European Union]] (contributes on behalf of the non-[[G7]] EU members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsp.org/about-us|title=About Us - Human Frontier Science Program|website=www.hfsp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The funds are combined into a single budget and are allocated to awards on the basis of HFSPO's own peer review system on the sole basis of scientific excellence.

==Funding programs==
Research Grants are awarded for novel collaborations involving extensive collaboration among teams of scientists working in different countries and in different disciplines. Two types of [[grants]] are available: '''Young Investigator Grants''' and '''Program Grants'''.&lt;ref name=ProgramGrants&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsp.org/funding/research-grants|title=Research Grants - Human Frontier Science Program|website=www.hfsp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postdoctoral Fellowships are available for scientists who wish to work in foreign laboratories, with emphasis on individuals early in their careers who wish to obtain training in a different field of research. Fellows who return to their home countries are eligible to apply for a '''Career Development Award'''.

'''Cross-disciplinary fellowships''' are intended for postdoctoral fellows with a [[Ph.D.]] degree in the [[physical sciences]], [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]], [[engineering]] and [[computer science]]s who wish to receive training in [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsp.org/funding/postdoctoral-fellowships|title=Postdoctoral Fellowships - Human Frontier Science Program|website=www.hfsp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HFSP funding programs start at the [[postdoctoral]] level. No support is available for [[undergraduate]] or PhD students.

==HFSP peer review==
International [[peer review]] is a cornerstone of the procedures used in making awards. There is one review committee for Fellowships and one for Research Grants each consisting of 24 to 26 scientists. They have a broad international representation of scientific experts and each reviews applications in all scientific fields supported by the HFSP. This ensures that awards are made according to international scientific standards and the presence of reviewers from many countries minimizes geo-political bias. Extensive research is carried out into the expertise and reputation of potential members before appointment to ensure maintenance of the highest standards. The evaluation procedures are under constant review and the HFSP secretariat works closely with the members of the review committees and the Council of Scientists to ensure that all applications are assessed fairly and thoroughly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsp.org/funding/research-grants/review-procedures|title=Review procedures - Human Frontier Science Program|website=www.hfsp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsp.org/funding/postdoctoral-fellowships/review-procedure|title=Fellowship Review Procedure - Human Frontier Science Program|website=www.hfsp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HFSP Nakasone Award==
In 2010, HFSP established the HFSP Nakasone Award to honour former Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] of Japan for his vision in launching HFSP as a program of support for international collaboration and to foster early career scientists in a global context.  The HFSP Nakasone Award is designed to recognise scientists who have undertaken frontier-moving research, including technological breakthroughs, which has advanced biological research. Both senior and junior scientists are eligible and peer-recognised excellence is the major criterion.  The award can be made to an individual or a team of scientists.  Award winners receive an unrestricted research grant of [[USD]] 10,000, a medal and personalised certificate. The award ceremony is held at the annual HFSP Awardees Meeting where the award winners are expected to deliver the HFSP Nakasone Lecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsp.org/awardees/hfsp-nakasone-award|title=HFSP Nakasone Award - Human Frontier Science Program|website=www.hfsp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HFSP Journal==
Launched in October 2006, the HFSP Journal aims to foster communication between scientists publishing high quality, innovative research at the frontiers of the life sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hfspj.aip.org/|title=HSFP Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer review is designed to allow for the unique requirements of such papers and is overseen by an Editorial Board with members from different disciplines. The HFSP Journal offers its authors the option to pay a fee to make their research articles Open Access immediately upon publication. For other articles, access is limited to subscribers for the first 6 months after publication, but access is free thereafter.

The HFSP Journal ceased publication in July 2010 and was bought by the scientific publisher Taylor &amp; Frances, to be re-launched in 2011 as “Frontiers in Life Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cookson |first1=Rod |last2=Ferrier |first2=Valerie |last3=Falaschi |first3=Arturo |title=Frontiers in Life Science |journal=HFSP Journal |volume=4 |issue=3–4 |pages=93 |year=2010 |pmid=20811566 |pmc=2929625 |doi=10.2976/1.3431352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Garbarino''' is an author and professor at [[Loyola University Chicago]]. He has specialized in studying what causes violence in children, how they cope with it and how to rehabilitate them. Garbarino has served as consultant or adviser to a wide range of organizations, including the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse, the National Institute for Mental Health, the [[American Medical Association]], the National Black Child Development Institute, the [[National Science Foundation]], the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, and the [[FBI]]. In addition, Garbarino's work is associated with the School of Human Ecology at Cornell University under the leadership of [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]] who began [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] programs in the US. 

==Academic work==
Garbarino has written on the causes of violent behavior in children and how they cope with [[Stress (psychological)|stress]]. He has studied the impact of war on children, including children in [[Kuwait]], [[Iraq]], [[Bosnia]], and [[Croatia]]. He has also conducted many interviews with children who have been convicted of violent crimes in the United States, concluding that [[child abuse|abuse]] and neglect at an early age are contributing causes to the violent behavior of these children. He has served as an [[expert witness]] involving issues of trauma, violence, and abuse in both civil and criminal trials. Garbarino and his coauthors have also conducted many interviews with other high school students and teachers about [[bullying]] and social problems at school to help understand ways to improve the school environment.

Garbarino recommends that violence prevention begin at an early age by recognizing underlying causes and addressing them before they expand. He advocates programs that provide assistance to young at-risk children and parents, including a home visiting program that provides home visitors to young mothers at risk to help with child care and provide advice about child rearing. Children who have benefited from this program have reduced drop out and delinquency rates.&lt;ref&gt;James Garbarino ''Lost Boys'' 1999 pp. 183-184.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also advised intervention when there are problems in school at a young age with advice and counseling rather than punishment when possible. He believes this is often less expensive and more productive than waiting for problems to get worse.&lt;ref&gt;James Garbarino ''Lost Boys'' 1999 pp. 188, 206-238.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Curwen by William Gush.jpg|thumb|Portrait of John Curwen by [[William Gush]], circa 1857]]
'''Reverend John Curwen''' (1816–1880) was an English [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] minister, and founder of the [[Tonic sol-fa]] system of [[music education]] with the help of [[Sarah Ann Glover]]. He was educated at Wymondley College (subsequently Coward College) and [[University College London]].&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Colles, et al. "Curwen." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 2 Jul 2008 &lt;http://0-www.oxfordmusiconline.com.catalogue.ulrls.lon.ac.uk:80/subscriber/article/grove/music/06973pg1&gt;.
Chicago. Curwen's autograph philosophical essays from University College are in the British Library, Add. Ms. 50752.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and biography==
John Curwen was a descendent of the Curwens of [[Workington Hall]] in Cumbria, one of the oldest families in England, the male line proper being a direct descent from Eldred, a pre-Norman Englishman, whose son Ketel held lands in the Barony of Kendal. Orm, Ketel's son, inherited the Cumbrian manor of Workington.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=1831-dcu&amp;cid=0#0&lt;/ref&gt;

Curwen was born 14 November 1816, at [[Heckmondwike]], West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Spedding Curwen and Mary Jubb. His father was a Non-conformist minister, as John was also from 1838 until 1864. Curwen gave up full-time ministry to devote himself to his new method of musical nomenclature.

He established the Tonic Sol-Fa Press in [[Plaistow, Newham|Plaistow]], where he had been a minister, and a college in nearby [[Forest Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Stratford, West Ham &amp; The Royal Docks| last=Pewsey| first=Stephen| year=1996| publisher=Sutton Publishing| isbn=0-7509-1417-3| page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curwen married Mary Thompson (1816–1890) in May 1845. They had four children – Margaret, John Spencer, Spedding and Thomas Herbert. Curwen died at Heaton Mersey on 16 May 1880. His son John Spencer married [[Annie Jessy Curwen|Annie Jessy Gregg]], who went on to write the extensive and influential series ''Mrs. Curwen's Pianoforte Method'' based on her adaptation for the piano of John Curwen's method for voice.

==Tonic sol-fa==
[[Image:Curwen Hand Signs MT.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Curwen's Solfege hand signs. This version includes the tonal tendencies and interesting titles for each tone.]]
Curwen's system was designed to aid in [[sight reading]] of the [[staff (music)|stave]] with its lines and spaces. He adapted it from a number of earlier musical systems, including the Norwich Sol-fa method of [[Sarah Ann Glover]] (1785–1867) of [[Norwich]]. Her Sol-fa system was based on the ancient [[Gamut (music)|gamut]]; but she omitted the constant recital of the alphabetical names of each note and the arbitrary syllable indicating key relationship, and also the recital of two or more such syllables when the same note was common to as many keys (e.g. C, Fa, Ut, meaning that C is the [[subdominant]] of G and the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of C). The notes were represented by the initials of the seven syllables, still in use in Italy and France as their names. Curwen taught himself to sight-read based on Glover's Norwich Sol-fa, made alterations and improvements, and named his method ''Tonic Sol-fa''. In the Tonic Sol-fa the seven letters refer to key relationship (relative pitch) and not to absolute pitch. Curwen utilised the first letter (lower case) of each of the solmisation tones (do, re, me, fa, sol, la, ti), and a rhythmic system that used [[bar line]]s (prefixing strong beats), half bar lines (prefixing medium beats), and semicolons (prefixing weak beats) in each measure.

Curwen felt the need for a simple way of teaching how to sing by note through his experiences among [[Sunday school]] teachers. Stemming from his religious and social beliefs, Curwen thought that music should be easily accessible to all classes and ages of people. Apart from Glover, similar ideas had been elaborated in France by [[Pierre Galin]] (1786–1821), [[Aimé Paris]] (1798–1866) and [[Emile Chevé]] (1804–1864), whose method of teaching how to read at sight also depended on the principle of tonic relationship being taught by the reference of every sound to its tonic, and by the use of a numeric notation. Curwen adapted French time names from Paris' ''Langue de durées''.

==Curwen's publications==
Curwen brought out his ''Grammar of Vocal Music'' in 1843, and in 1853 started the Tonic Sol-Fa Association. The ''Standard Course of Lessons on the Tonic Sol-fa Method of Teaching to Sing'' was published in 1858. In 1879 the Tonic Sol-Fa College was opened. Curwen also began publishing, and brought out a periodical called the ''Tonic Sol-fa Reporter and Magazine of Vocal Music for the People'', and in his later life was occupied in directing the spreading organisation of his system. With his son, John Spencer Curwen (1847–1916) who later became principal of the Tonic Sol-Fa College, Curwen incorporated the [[Curwen Press|J. Curwen &amp; Sons]] publishing firm in 1863. This firm continued as the Curwen Press into the 1970s, when it was closed. The Sol-fa system was widely adopted for use in education, as an easily teachable method in the reading of music at sight, but its more ambitious aims for providing a superior method of musical notation have not been generally adopted. In 1872, Curwen changed his former course of using the Sol-fa system as an aid to sight reading, when that edition of his ''Standard Course of Lessons'' excluded the staff and relied solely on Curwen's Tonic Sol-fa system.

Curwen technically did not invent Tonic Sol-fa. Rather he developed a distinct method of applying it in music education, including both rhythm and pitch. The name and current form can be traced to Curwen.

==Research==
In [[cognitive psychology]], John Anderson is widely known for his [[cognitive architecture]] [[ACT-R]]&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. &amp; Lebiere, C. (1998). ''The atomic components of thought''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (2007). ''How can the human mind occur in the physical universe?'' New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rational analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1991). ''Is human cognition adaptive?'' Behavioral and Brain Sciences 14, 471–517.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1990). "The adaptive character of thought". Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; He has published many papers on cognitive psychology, including recent criticism of unjustified claims in [[mathematics education]] that lack experimental warrant and sometimes (in extreme cases) contradict known findings in cognitive psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last1=Anderson | first1=John&amp;nbsp;R. &lt;!-- | authorlink1=John Robert Anderson (psychologist) --&gt; | first2=Lynne&amp;nbsp;M. | last2=Reder | first3=Herbert&amp;nbsp;A. | last3=Simon |authorlink3=Herbert A. Simon | author4=K.&amp;nbsp;Anders Ericsson | author5=Robert Glaser | title=Radical constructivism and cognitive psychology | journal=Brookings Papers on Education Policy | editor=[[Diane Ravitch]] | year=1998 | volume=6 | issue=1 | pages=227–278 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also an early leader in research on [[intelligent tutoring systems]], such as [[cognitive tutors]], and many of Anderson's former students, such as [[Kenneth Koedinger]] and [[Neil Heffernan]], have become leaders in that area.

=== Intelligent tutoring systems ===
Anderson's research has used fMRI brain imaging to study how students learn with intelligent tutoring systems.&lt;ref name="act-r.psy.cmu.edu"&gt;http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/publications/pubinfo.php?id=819&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of his studies have looked at neural processes of students while they are solving algebraic equations or proofs.

Anderson and colleagues generated a cognitive model that predicted that while students were learning an algebra proof, neuroimages showed decreased activation in a lateral inferior prefrontal region and a predefined fusiform region.  This decrease in activity showed an increased fluency in retrieving declarative information, as students required less activity in these regions to solve the problems.&lt;ref name="act-r.psy.cmu.edu"/&gt;

=== Cognitive stages when solving mathematical problems ===
In a 2012 study, Anderson and Fincham (a Carnegie Mellon University colleague) conducted a study that looked at the cognitive stages participants engaged in when solving mathematical problems.  These stages included encoding, planning, solving, and response.  The study determined how much time participants spent in each problem solving stage when presented with a mathematical problem.  Multi-voxel pattern recognition techniques and Hidden Markov models were used to determine participants' problem solving stages.

Results of the study showed that the time spent in the planning stage was dependent on the novelty of the problem.  The time spent in the solving stage was dependent on the amount of computation required for the particular problem.  Lastly, the time spent in the response stage was dependent on the complexity of the response required by the problem.&lt;ref&gt;http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/publications/pubinfo.php?id=1053&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decomposition Hypothesis ===
In another study, Anderson and colleagues used a video game task to test the Decomposition Hypothesis, or the idea that a complex cognitive task can be broken down into a set of information processing components.  The combination of these components remains the same across different tasks.  The study used a cognitive model that predicted behavioral and activation patterns for specific regions in the brain.

The predictions involved both tonic activation, which remained stable across brain regions during game play, and phasic activation, which was present only when there was resource competition. The study's results supported the Decomposition Hypothesis.  Individual differences were also found in participants' learning gains, which indicated that learning a complex skill is dependent on cognitive capacity limits.&lt;ref&gt;http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/publications/pubinfo.php?id=974&lt;/ref&gt;''''''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3277">'''Kimon Nicolaїdes''' (1891&amp;ndash;1938) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[United States|American]] [[art]] teacher, author and artist. During World War I, he served in the U.S. Army in France as a [[camouflage]] artist.

==Early life==
Nicolaïdes was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], where his Greek-born father worked as an importer of Asian artifacts. His mother's American ancestors date back to the Colonial period. He made his living initially by a variety of jobs, including picture framing, journalism, and even by appearing once in a film as an extra, playing the role of an art student. Despite his family's opposition, he did in fact become an art student, during which he attended the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students' League]] in [[New York City]], where he studied with [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] and [[George Bridgman]]. At the Art Students League he met the avant-garde couple [[Wilhelmina Weber Furlong]] and her husband [[Thomas Furlong (artist)]]&lt;ref&gt;The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm by Clint B. Weber, {{ISBN|978-0-9851601-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Camouflage service==
He served in the U.S. Army in [[France]] during [[World War I]], where he was one of the first American camouflage artists, serving in the same unit as [[Barry Faulkner]], [[Sherry Edmundson Fry]], [[Abraham Rattner]] and others. Among his wartime duties, he often worked with [[contour maps]].

==Teaching career==
Following World War I, he returned to New York to teach at the Art Students' League.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstudentsleague.org/About/History/InstructorsandLecturers.aspx Art Students League of New York] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030357/http://www.theartstudentsleague.org/About/History/InstructorsandLecturers.aspx |date=2016-03-04 }} - Instructors and Lecturers - Past and Present&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/catalog/authordetail.cfm?authorID=3909 Houghton Mifflin] - bio&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, he developed a method of teaching drawing that he shared in the world-famous and widely used ''The Natural Way to Draw'' (1941).

==His influence==
At the time of Nicolaïdes' death, the manuscript for ''The Natural Way to Draw'' was incomplete. A close friend and former student, Mamie Harmon, oversaw its completion and its publication in 1941. (Harmon's papers are available in the Archives of American Art.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/collection/harmmami.htm Mamie Harmon Papers Relating to Kimon Nicolaides, 1935-1985 / Archives of American Art]&lt;/ref&gt; His influence on the teaching of drawing has been long-lasting and substantial, and his book is still in use today. In brief, he taught drawing by (1) exploring the edge of the subject with 'contour drawing', (2) encouraging free and rapid 'gesture drawing', (3) encouraging tonal drawings of weight or mass, and (4) (most importantly) prescribing a daily exercise of 'memory drawing'.

==Overview of models==
There are many different learning styles models; one literature review identified 71 different models.&lt;ref name="Coffield" /&gt;{{rp|166–168}} Only a few models are described below.

===David Kolb's model===
[[David A. Kolb]]'s model is based on his [[experiential learning]] model, as explained in his book ''Experiential Learning''.&lt;ref name="Kolb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kolb |first=David A. |authorlink=David A. Kolb |date=2015 |origyear=1984 |title=Experiential learning: experience as the source of learning and development |edition=2nd |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=9780133892406 |oclc=909815841 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6DfBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolb's model outlines two related approaches toward grasping experience: ''Concrete Experience'' and ''Abstract Conceptualization'', as well as two related approaches toward transforming experience: ''Reflective Observation'' and ''Active Experimentation''.&lt;ref name="Kolb"/&gt;{{rp|145}} According to Kolb's model, the ideal learning process engages all four of these modes in response to situational demands; they form a [[learning cycle]] from experience to observation to conceptualization to experimentation and back to experience. In order for learning to be effective, Kolb postulated, all four of these approaches must be incorporated. As individuals attempt to use all four approaches, they may tend to develop strengths in one experience-grasping approach and one experience-transforming approach, leading them to prefer one of the following four learning styles:&lt;ref name="Kolb"/&gt;{{rp|127}}&lt;ref name="SmithKolb1986"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Donna M. |last2=Kolb |first2=David A. |authorlink2=David A. Kolb |date=1996 |origyear=1986 |title=User's guide for the learning-style inventory: a manual for teachers and trainers |location=Boston |publisher=McBer |oclc=38505355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Accommodator = ''Concrete Experience + Active Experiment'': strong in "hands-on" practical doing (e.g., [[physical therapist]]s)
# Converger = ''Abstract Conceptualization + Active Experiment'': strong in practical "hands-on" application of theories (e.g., [[engineer]]s)
# Diverger = ''Concrete Experience + Reflective Observation'': strong in imaginative ability and discussion (e.g., [[social worker]]s)
# Assimilator = ''Abstract Conceptualization + Reflective Observation'': strong in inductive reasoning and creation of theories (e.g., [[philosopher]]s)

Kolb's model gave rise to the Learning Style Inventory, an assessment method used to determine an individual's learning style. According to this model, individuals may exhibit a preference for one of the four styles — Accommodating, Converging, Diverging and Assimilating — depending on their approach to learning in Kolb's experiential learning model.&lt;ref name="Kolb"/&gt;

Although Kolb's model is widely accepted with substantial empirical support and has been revised over the years, a 2013 study pointed out that Kolb's Learning Style Inventory, among its other weaknesses, incorrectly dichotomizes individuals on the abstract/concrete and reflective/action dimensions of experiential learning (in much the same way as the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] does in a different context), and proposed instead that these dimensions be treated as continuous rather than dichotomous/binary variables.&lt;ref name="Manolis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Manolis |first1=Chris |last2=Burns |first2=David J. |last3=Assudani |first3=Rashmi |last4=Chinta |first4=Ravi |date=February 2013 |title=Assessing experiential learning styles: a methodological reconstruction and validation of the Kolb Learning Style Inventory |journal=[[Learning and Individual Differences]] |volume=23 |pages=44–52 |doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2012.10.009 |url=http://research.phoenix.edu/sites/default/files/publication-files/2012-Manolis%20et%20al(2012).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}

===Peter Honey and Alan Mumford's model===
Peter Honey and Alan Mumford adapted Kolb's experiential learning model. First, they renamed the stages in the [[learning cycle]] to accord with [[managerial]] experiences: ''having'' an experience, ''reviewing'' the experience, ''concluding'' from the experience, and ''planning'' the next steps.&lt;ref name="Mumford"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mumford |first=Alan |chapter=Putting learning styles to work |title=Action learning at work |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=rgOoHgxObfwC&amp;pg=PA121 |year=1997 |publisher=Gower |location=Aldershot, Hampshire; Brookfield, VT |pages=121–135 |isbn=0566078902 |oclc=35777384}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|121–122}} Second, they aligned these stages to four learning styles named:&lt;ref name="Mumford"/&gt;{{rp|122–124}}

# Activist
# Reflector
# Theorist 
# Pragmatist

These four learning styles are assumed to be acquired preferences that are adaptable, either at will or through changed circumstances, rather than being fixed personality characteristics. Honey and Mumford's Learning Styles Questionnaire (LSQ)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Honey |first1=Peter |last2=Mumford |first2=Alan |date=2006 |title=Learning styles questionnaire: 80-item version |location=London |publisher=Maidenhead |isbn=1902899296 |oclc=889619009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a self-development tool and differs from Kolb's Learning Style Inventory by inviting managers to complete a checklist of work-related behaviours without directly asking managers how they learn. Having completed the self-assessment, managers are encouraged to focus on strengthening underutilised styles in order to become better equipped to learn from a wide range of everyday experiences.

A [[Ipsos MORI|MORI]] survey commissioned by The Campaign for Learning in 1999 found the Honey and Mumford LSQ to be the most widely used system for assessing preferred learning styles in the local government sector in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Learning modalities===
Walter Burke Barbe and colleagues proposed three learning modalities (often identified by the [[acronym]] VAK):&lt;ref name="Barbe1979"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barbe |first1=Walter Burke |last2=Swassing |first2=Raymond H. |last3=Milone |first3=Michael N. |date=1979 |title=Teaching through modality strengths: concepts practices |location=Columbus, Ohio |publisher=Zaner-Bloser |isbn=0883091003 |oclc=5990906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbe and colleagues reported that learning modality strengths can occur independently or in combination (although the most frequent modality strengths, according to their research, are visual or mixed), they can change over time, and they become integrated with age.&lt;ref name="Barbe1981"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barbe |first1=Walter Burke |last2=Milone |first2=Michael N. |title=What we know about modality strengths |journal=Educational Leadership |publisher=[[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development]] |date=February 1981 |pages=378–380 |url=http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_198102_barbe.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also pointed out that learning modality ''strengths'' are different from ''preferences''; a person's self-reported modality preference may not correspond to their empirically measured modality strength.&lt;ref name="Barbe1981"/&gt;{{rp|378}} This disconnect between strengths and preferences was confirmed by a subsequent study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krätzig |first1=Gregory P. |last2=Arbuthnott |first2=Katherine D. |date=February 2006 |title=Perceptual learning style and learning proficiency: a test of the hypothesis |journal=[[Journal of Educational Psychology]] |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=238–246 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.98.1.238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some scholars have criticized the VAK model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sharp |first1=John G. |last2=Bowker |first2=Rob |last3=Byrne |first3=Jenny |date=September 2008 |title=VAK or VAK-uous?: towards the trivialisation of learning and the death of scholarship |journal=Research Papers in Education |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=293–314 |doi=10.1080/02671520701755416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franklin |first=Shirley |date=March 2006 |title=VAKing out learning styles—why the notion of 'learning styles' is unhelpful to teachers |journal=Education 3–13: International Journal of Primary, Elementary and Early Years Education |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=81–87 |doi=10.1080/03004270500507644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Scott Lilienfeld]] and colleagues have argued that much use of the VAK model is nothing more than [[pseudoscience]] or a psychological [[urban legend]].&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lilienfeld |first1=Scott O. |authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld |last2=Lynn |first2=Steven Jay |last3=Ruscio |first3=John |last4=Beyerstein |first4=Barry L. |authorlink4=Barry Beyerstein |date=2010 |chapter=Myth #18: Students learn best when teaching styles are matched to their learning styles |title=50 great myths of popular psychology: shattering widespread misconceptions about human behavior |location=Chichester, UK; Malden, MA |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |isbn=9781405131117 |oclc=396172891 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=8DlS0gfO_QUC&amp;pg=PT85 |pages=92–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Observational learning|Social learning]]

Fleming claimed that [[Visual learning|visual learners]] have a preference for seeing (visual aids that represent ideas using methods other than words, such as graphs, charts, diagrams, symbols, etc.). Subsequent [[neuroimaging]] research has suggested that visual learners convert words into images in the brain and vice versa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kraemer |first1=David J. M. |last2=Rosenberg |first2=Lauren M. |last3=Thompson-Schill |first3=Sharon L. |date=March 2009 |title=The neural correlates of visual and verbal cognitive styles |journal=[[The Journal of Neuroscience]] |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=3792–3798 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4635-08.2009 |pmid=19321775 |pmc=2697032}} Also reported in: {{cite web |date=28 March 2009 |title=Visual learners convert words to pictures in the brain and vice versa, says psychology study |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090325091834.htm |publisher=[[Science Daily]] |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some psychologists have argued that this "is not an instance of learning styles, rather, it is an instance of ability appearing as a style".&lt;ref name="Willingham2015"/&gt;{{rp|268}} Likewise, Fleming claimed that [[Auditory learning|auditory learners]] best learn through listening (lectures, discussions, tapes, etc.), and [[Kinesthetic learning|tactile/kinesthetic learners]] prefer to learn via experience—moving, touching, and doing (active exploration of the world, science projects, experiments, etc.). Students can use the model to identify their preferred learning style and, it is claimed, maximize their learning by focusing on the mode that benefits them the most. Fleming's model also posits two types of multimodality.&lt;ref name="VARK"/&gt;

===Anthony Gregorc's model===
[[Anthony Gregorc]] and Kathleen Butler organized a model describing different learning styles rooted in the way individuals acquire and process information differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Kathleen Ann |last2=Gregorc |first2=Anthony F. |authorlink2=Anthony Gregorc |date=1988 |title=It's all in your mind: a student's guide to learning style |location=Columbia, CT |publisher=Learner's Dimension |isbn=0945852010 |oclc=20848567}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model posits that an individual's perceptual abilities are the foundation of his or her specific learning strengths, or learning styles.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Margaret |title=Mind Styles: Anthony Gregorc |url=http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Gregorc.htm |website=cortland.edu |date=3 February 2004 |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this model, there are two perceptual qualities: ''concrete'' and ''abstract'', and two ordering abilities: ''random'' and ''sequential''.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; Concrete perceptions involve registering information through the five senses, while abstract perceptions involve the understanding of ideas, qualities, and concepts which cannot be seen. In regard to the two ordering abilities, sequential ordering involves the organization of information in a linear, logical way, and random ordering involves the organization of information in chunks and in no specific order.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; The model posits that both of the perceptual qualities and both of the ordering abilities are present in each individual, but some qualities and ordering abilities are more dominant within certain individuals.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

There are four combinations of perceptual qualities and ordering abilities based on dominance: ''concrete sequential'', ''abstract random'', ''abstract sequential'', and ''concrete random''. The model posits that individuals with different combinations learn in different ways—they have different strengths, different things make sense to them, different things are difficult for them, and they ask different questions throughout the learning process.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

The [[Test validity|validity]] of Gregorc's model has been questioned by Thomas Reio and Albert Wiswell following experimental trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reio |first1=Thomas G. |last2=Wiswell |first2=Albert K. |date=June 2006 |title=An examination of the factor structure and construct validity of the Gregorc Style Delineator |journal=[[Educational and Psychological Measurement]] |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=489–501 |doi=10.1177/0013164405282459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregorc argues that his critics have "scientifically-limited views" and that they wrongly repudiate the "mystical elements" of "the spirit" that can only be discerned by a "subtle human instrument".&lt;ref name="Gregorc"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gregorc |first=Anthony F. |authorlink=Anthony Gregorc |title=Frequently asked questions on style |url=http://gregorc.com/faq.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504072936/http://gregorc.com/faq.html |website=gregorc.com |date=29 January 2015 |archivedate=4 May 2015 |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive approaches===
Anthony Grasha and Sheryl Riechmann, in 1974, formulated the Grasha-Reichmann Learning Style Scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riechmann |first1=Sheryl Wetter |last2=Grasha |first2=Anthony F. |date=July 1974 |title=A rational approach to developing and assessing the construct validity of a student learning style scales instrument |journal=[[The Journal of Psychology]] |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=213–223 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1974.9915693}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed to analyze the attitudes of students and how they approach learning. The test was originally designed to provide teachers with insight on how to approach instructional plans for college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grasha |first=Anthony F. |date=1996 |title=Teaching with style: a practical guide to enhancing learning by understanding teaching and learning styles |series=Curriculum for change series |location=Pittsburgh |publisher=Alliance Publishers |isbn=0964507110 |oclc=34349818}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grasha's background was in [[cognitive processes]] and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] techniques. Unlike some models of cognitive styles which are relatively nonjudgmental, Grasha and Riechmann distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive styles. The names of Grasha and Riechmann's learning styles are:

*avoidant
*participative
*competitive
*collaborative
*dependent
*independent

Aiming to explain why aptitude tests, school grades, and classroom performance often fail to identify real ability, [[Robert Sternberg]] listed various cognitive dimensions in his book ''Thinking Styles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sternberg |first=Robert J. |authorlink=Robert Sternberg |date=1997 |title=Thinking styles |location=Cambridge, UK; New York |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0521553164 |oclc=36315844 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dgxBqGIfJjAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other models are also often used when researching [[cognitive style]]s; some of these models are described in books that Sternberg co-edited, such as ''Perspectives on Thinking, Learning, and Cognitive Styles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Sternberg |editor1-first=Robert J. |editor1-link=Robert Sternberg |editor2-last=Zhang |editor2-first=Li-fang |date=2001 |title=Perspectives on thinking, learning, and cognitive styles |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum Associates]] |isbn=0805834303 |oclc=44619517 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMeQAgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Zhang |editor1-first=Li-fang |editor2-last=Sternberg |editor2-first=Robert J. |editor2-link=Robert Sternberg |date=2009 |title=Perspectives on the nature of intellectual styles |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=9780826104601 |oclc=301893408 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6drSmW4AbfEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Zhang |editor1-first=Li-fang |editor2-last=Sternberg |editor2-first=Robert J. |editor2-link=Robert Sternberg |editor3-last=Rayner |editor3-first=Stephen |date=2012 |title=Handbook of intellectual styles: preferences in cognition, learning, and thinking |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=9780826106674 |oclc=714734148 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Og8rJGaXCDwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the [[National Association of Secondary School Principals]] (NASSP) formed a task force to study learning styles.&lt;ref name="Keefe1985"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keefe |first=James W. |date=March 1985 |title=Assessment of learning style variables: the NASSP task force model |journal=Theory Into Practice |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=138–144 |jstor=1476430 |doi=10.1080/00405848509543162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task force defined three broad categories of style—cognitive, affective, and physiological—and 31 variables, including the perceptual strengths and preferences from the VAK model of Barbe and colleagues,&lt;ref name="Barbe1981"/&gt; but also many other variables such as need for structure, types of motivation, time of day preferences, and so on.&lt;ref name="Keefe1985"/&gt;{{rp|141–143}} They defined a learning style as "a ''[[Holism|gestalt]]''—not an amalgam of related characteristics but greater than any of its parts. It is a composite of internal and external operations based in neurobiology, personality, and human development and reflected in learner behavior."&lt;ref name="Keefe1985"/&gt;{{rp|141}}

* Cognitive styles are preferred ways of perception, organization and retention.
* Affective styles represent the motivational dimensions of the learning personality; each learner has a personal motivational approach.
* Physiological styles are bodily states or predispositions, including sex-related differences, health and nutrition, and reaction to physical surroundings, such as preferences for levels of light, sound, and temperature.&lt;ref name="Keefe1985"/&gt;{{rp|141}}

According to the NASSP task force, styles are hypothetical constructs that help to explain the learning (and teaching) process. They posited that one can recognize the learning style of an individual student by observing his or her behavior.&lt;ref name="Keefe1985"/&gt;{{rp|138}} Learning has taken place only when one observes a relatively stable change in learner behavior resulting from what has been experienced.

==Assessment methods==

===Learning Style Inventory===
The Learning Style Inventory (LSI) is connected with [[David A. Kolb]]'s model and is used to determine a student's learning style.&lt;ref name="SmithKolb1986"/&gt; Previous versions of the LSI have been criticized for problems with validity, reliability, and other issues.&lt;ref name="Manolis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koob |first1=Jeffrey J. |last2=Funk |first2=Joanie |date=March 2002 |title=Kolb's learning style inventory: issues of reliability and validity |journal=[[Research on Social Work Practice]] |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=293–308 |doi=10.1177/104973150201200206 |url=http://www.bu.edu/ssw/files/2010/10/Kolbs-Learning-Style-Inventory-Issues-of-Reliability-and-Validity1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Metallidou |first1=Panayiota |last2=Platsidou |first2=Maria |date=2008 |title=Kolb's Learning Style Inventory-1985: validity issues and relations with metacognitive knowledge about problem-solving strategies |journal=[[Learning and Individual Differences]] |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=114–119 |doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2007.11.001 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maria_Platsidou/publication/229383282_Kolb%27s_Learning_Style_Inventory-1985_Validity_issues_and_relations_with_metacognitive_knowledge_about_problem-solving_strategies/links/0fcfd50b9cf157eecc000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 4 of the Learning Style Inventory replaces the four learning styles of previous versions with nine new learning styles: initiating, experiencing, imagining, reflecting, analyzing, thinking, deciding, acting, and balancing.&lt;ref name="LSI4"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kolb learning style inventory (KLSI), version 4 online: description |url=http://www.haygroup.com/leadershipandtalentondemand/ourproducts/item_details.aspx?itemid=118&amp;type=2&amp;t=2 |website=haygroup.com |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LSI is intended to help employees or students "understand how their learning style impacts upon problem solving, teamwork, handling conflict, communication and career choice; develop more learning flexibility; find out why teams work well—or badly—together; strengthen their overall learning."&lt;ref name="LSI4"/&gt;

A completely different Learning Styles Inventory is associated with a binary division of learning styles, developed by [[Richard Felder]] and Linda Silverman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Felder |first1=Richard M. |last2=Silverman |first2=Linda K. |date=January 1988 |title=Learning and teaching styles in engineering education |journal=Engineering Education |volume=78 |issue=7 |pages=674–81 |url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/LS-1988.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Felder and Silverman's model, learning styles are a balance between pairs of extremes such as: Active/Reflective, Sensing/Intuitive, Verbal/Visual, and Sequential/Global. Students receive four scores describing these balances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html |title=Index of learning styles questionnaire |first=Barbara A. |last=Soloman |first2=Richard M. |last2=Felder |publisher=[[North Carolina State University]] |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the LSI mentioned above, this inventory provides overviews and synopses for teachers.

===NASSP Learning Style Profile===
The NASSP Learning Style Profile (LSP) is a second-generation instrument for the diagnosis of student cognitive styles, perceptual responses, and study and instructional preferences.&lt;ref name="KeefeMonk1988"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keefe |first1=James W. |last2=Monk |first2=John S. |date=1988 |title=Learning style profile: technical manual |location=Reston, VA |publisher=[[National Association of Secondary School Principals]] |isbn=0882102133 |oclc=22143235}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LSP is a diagnostic tool intended as the basis for comprehensive style assessment with students in the sixth to twelfth grades. It was developed by the [[National Association of Secondary School Principals]] research department in conjunction with a national task force of learning style experts. The Profile was developed in four phases with initial work undertaken at the [[University of Vermont]] (cognitive elements), [[Ohio State University]] (affective elements), and [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]] (physiological/environmental elements). Rigid validation and normative studies were conducted using factor analytic methods to ensure strong construct validity and subscale independence.

The LSP contains 23 scales representing four higher order factors: cognitive styles, perceptual responses, study preferences and instructional preferences (the affective and physiological elements). The LSP scales are: analytic skill, spatial skill, discrimination skill, categorizing skill, sequential processing skill, simultaneous processing skill, memory skill, perceptual response: visual, perceptual response: auditory, perceptual response: emotive, persistence orientation, verbal risk orientation, verbal-spatial preference, manipulative preference, study time preference: early morning, study time preference: late morning, study time preference: afternoon, study time preference: evening, grouping preference, posture preference, mobility preference, sound preference, lighting preference, temperature preference.&lt;ref name="KeefeMonk1988"/&gt;

===Other methods===
Other methods (usually questionnaires) used to identify learning styles include [[Neil Fleming]]'s VARK Questionnaire&lt;ref name="Leite"/&gt; and Jackson's Learning Styles Profiler.&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|56–59}} Many other tests have gathered popularity and various levels of credibility among students and teachers.

==In the classroom==
Various researchers have attempted to hypothesize ways in which learning style theory can be used in the classroom. Two such scholars are Rita Dunn and Kenneth Dunn, who build upon a [[#Learning modalities|learning modalities]] approach.&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|20–35}}&lt;ref name="Dunn1978"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunn |first1=Rita Stafford |last2=Dunn |first2=Kenneth J. |date=1978 |title=Teaching students through their individual learning styles: a practical approach |location=Reston, VA |publisher=Reston Pub. Co. |isbn=0879098082 |oclc=3844703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although learning styles will inevitably differ among students in the classroom, Dunn and Dunn say that teachers should try to make changes in their classroom that will be beneficial to every learning style. Some of these changes include room redesign, the development of small-group techniques, and the development of "contract activity packages".&lt;ref name="Dunn1978"/&gt; Redesigning the classroom involves locating dividers that can be used to arrange the room creatively (such as having different learning stations and instructional areas), clearing the floor area, and incorporating student thoughts and ideas into the design of the classroom.&lt;ref name="Dunn1978"/&gt;

Dunn and Dunn's "contract activity packages" are educational plans that use: a clear statement of the learning need; multisensory resources (auditory, visual, tactile, kinesthetic); activities through which the newly mastered information can be used creatively; the sharing of creative projects within small groups; at least three small-group techniques; a pre-test, a self-test, and a post-test.&lt;ref name="Dunn1978"/&gt;

Another scholar who believes that learning styles should have an effect on the classroom is Marilee Sprenger in ''Differentiation through Learning Styles and Memory''.&lt;ref name="Sprenger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sprenger |first=Marilee |date=2008 |origyear=2003 |title=Differentiation through learning styles and memory |edition=2nd |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[Corwin Press]] |isbn=9781412955447 |oclc=192109691 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaVu2p5uDBkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; She bases her work on three premises:
#Teachers can be learners, and learners teachers. We are all both.
#Everyone can learn under the right circumstances.
#Learning is fun! Make it appealing.&lt;ref name="Sprenger"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}}

Sprenger details how to teach in visual, auditory, or tactile/kinesthetic ways. Methods for visual learners include ensuring that students can see words written, using pictures, and drawing [[timeline]]s for events.&lt;ref name="Sprenger"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}} Methods for auditory learners include repeating words aloud, small-group discussion, debates, listening to books on tape, oral reports, and oral interpretation.&lt;ref name="Sprenger"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}} Methods for tactile/kinesthetic learners include hands-on activities (experiments, etc.), projects, frequent breaks to allow movement, visual aids, role play, and field trips.&lt;ref name="Sprenger"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}} By using a variety of teaching methods from each of these categories, teachers cater to different learning styles at once, and improve learning by challenging students to learn in different ways.

James W. Keefe and John M. Jenkins have incorporated learning style assessment as a basic component in their "personalized instruction" model of schooling.&lt;ref name="KeefeJenkins2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keefe |first1=James W. |last2=Jenkins |first2=John M. |date=2008 |origyear=2000 |title=Personalized instruction: the key to student achievement |edition=2nd |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] Education |isbn=9781578867554 |oclc=173509416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six basic elements constitute the culture and context of personalized instruction. The cultural components—teacher role, student learning characteristics, and collegial relationships—establish the foundation of personalization and ensure that the school prizes a caring and collaborative environment. The contextual factors—interactivity, flexible scheduling, and authentic assessment—establish the structure of personalization.&lt;ref name="KeefeJenkins2008"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}}

According to Keefe and Jenkins, cognitive and learning style analysis have a special role in the process of personalizing instruction. The assessment of student learning style, more than any other element except the teacher role, establishes the foundation for a personalized approach to schooling: for student advisement and placement, for appropriate retraining of student cognitive skills, for adaptive instructional strategy, and for the authentic evaluation of learning.&lt;ref name="KeefeJenkins2008"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}} Some learners respond best in instructional environments based on an analysis of their perceptual and environmental style preferences: most individualized and personalized teaching methods reflect this point of view. Other learners, however, need help to function successfully in ''any'' learning environment. If a youngster cannot cope under conventional instruction, enhancing his cognitive skills may make successful achievement possible.&lt;ref name="KeefeJenkins2008"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}}

Many of the student learning problems that learning style diagnosis attempts to solve relate directly to elements of the human information processing system. Processes such as attention, perception and memory, and operations such as integration and retrieval of information are internal to the system. Any hope for improving student learning necessarily involves an understanding and application of information processing theory. Learning style assessment can provide a window to understanding and managing this process.&lt;ref name="KeefeJenkins2008"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}}

At least one study evaluating teaching styles and learning styles, however, has found that congruent groups have no significant differences in achievement from incongruent groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spoon |first1=Jerry C. |last2=Schell |first2=John W. |date=Winter 1998 |title=Aligning student learning styles with instructor teaching styles |journal=Journal of Industrial Teacher Education |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=41–56 |url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JITE/v35n2/spoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, learning style in this study varied by demography, specifically by age, suggesting a change in learning style as one gets older and acquires more experience. While significant age differences did occur, as well as no experimental manipulation of classroom assignment, the findings do call into question the aim of congruent teaching–learning styles in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|122}}

Educational researchers Eileen Carnell and Caroline Lodge concluded that learning styles are not fixed and that they are dependent on circumstance, purpose and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carnell |first1=Eileen |last2=Lodge |first2=Caroline |date=2002 |title=Supporting effective learning |location=London; Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=Paul Chapman Publishing; [[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=0761970460 |oclc=48110229 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=5AgCUC7M05sC&amp;pg=PA22 22]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Learning style theories have been criticized by many scholars and researchers. Some psychologists and neuroscientists have questioned the scientific basis for separating out students based on learning style. According to [[Susan Greenfield]] the practice is "nonsense" from a neuroscientific point of view: "Humans have evolved to build a picture of the world through our senses working in unison, exploiting the immense interconnectivity that exists in the brain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henry |first=Julie |title=Professor pans 'learning style' teaching method |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1558822/Professor-pans-learning-style-teaching-method.html |accessdate=29 August 2010 |newspaper=[[The Telegraph (U.K.)|The Telegraph]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219060846/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1558822/Professor-pans-learning-style-teaching-method.html |archivedate=19 December 2009 |date=29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Educational psychology|educational psychologists]] have shown that there is little evidence for the efficacy of most learning style models, and furthermore, that the models often rest on dubious theoretical grounds.&lt;ref name="Curry"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Curry |first=Lynn |year=October 1990 |title=A critique of the research on learning styles |journal=Educational Leadership |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=50–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohrer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rohrer |first1=Doug |last2=Pashler |first2=Harold |date=July 2012 |title=Learning styles: where's the evidence? |journal=Medical Education |volume=46 |issue=7 |pages=634–635 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04273.x |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED535732.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to professor of education Steven Stahl, there has been an "utter failure to find that assessing children's learning styles and matching to instructional methods has any effect on their learning."&lt;ref name="Stahl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stahl |first=Steven A. |date=2004 |chapter=Different strokes for different folks? |editor-last=Abbeduto |editor-first=Leonard |title=Taking sides: clashing views on controversial issues in educational psychology |location=Guilford, CT |publisher=Dushkin/[[McGraw-Hill]] |pages=98–107 |isbn=0072917237 |oclc=53479331 |chapterurl=http://linksprogram.gmu.edu/tutorcorner/NCLC495Readings/Stahl_DifferentStrokes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of education Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that learning styles such as VARK are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Claxton |first=Guy |date=2008 |title=What's the point of school?: rediscovering the heart of education |location=Richmond |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications]] |isbn=9781851686032 |oclc=228582273 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0X3YAQAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22learning+styles%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, psychologist Kris Vasquez pointed out a number of problems with learning styles, including the lack of empirical evidence that learning styles are useful in producing student achievement, but also her more serious concern that the use of learning styles in the classroom could lead students to develop self-limiting implicit theories about themselves that could become [[Self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]] that are harmful, rather than beneficial, to the goal of serving student diversity.&lt;ref name="Vasquez"/&gt;

Psychologists [[Scott Lilienfeld]], [[Barry Beyerstein]], and colleagues listed as one of the "50 great myths of popular psychology" the idea that "students learn best when teaching styles are matched to their learning styles", and they summarized some relevant reasons not to believe this "myth".&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"/&gt;

===Critique made by Coffield et al.===
A 2004 non-peer-reviewed literature review by authors from the [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne]] criticized most of the main instruments used to identify an individual's learning style.&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt; In conducting the review, Frank Coffield and his colleagues selected 13 of the most influential models of the 71 models they identified,&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|8–9}} including most of the models cited on this page. They examined the theoretical origins and terms of each model, and the instrument that purported to assess individuals against the learning styles defined by the model. They analyzed the claims made by the author(s), external studies of these claims, and independent empirical evidence of the relationship between the learning style identified by the instrument and students' actual learning. Coffield's team found that none of the most popular learning style theories had been adequately validated through independent research.

One of the most widely known theories assessed by Coffield's team was the learning styles model of Dunn and Dunn. This model is widely used in schools in the United States, and 177 articles have been published in peer-reviewed journals referring to this model.&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|20}} The conclusion of Coffield and colleagues was: "Despite a large and evolving research programme, forceful claims made for impact are questionable because of limitations in many of the supporting studies and the lack of independent research on the model."&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

Coffield's team claimed that another model, [[Anthony Gregorc]]'s Gregorc Style Delineator, was "theoretically and psychometrically flawed" and "not suitable for the assessment of individuals".&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

===Critique of Kolb's model===
Mark K. Smith compiled and reviewed some critiques of Kolb's model in his article, "David A. Kolb on Experiential Learning". According to Smith's research, there are six key issues regarding the model:

# The model doesn't adequately address the process of reflection; 
# The claims it makes about the four learning styles are extravagant; 
# It doesn't sufficiently address the fact of different cultural conditions and experiences; 
# The idea of stages/steps doesn't necessarily match reality; 
# It has only weak empirical evidence; 
# The relationship between learning processes and knowledge is more complex than Kolb draws it.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Mark K. |title=David A. Kolb on experiential learning |url=http://infed.org/mobi/david-a-kolb-on-experiential-learning/ |website=infed.org |date=April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705001707/http://infed.org/mobi/david-a-kolb-on-experiential-learning/ |archivedate=5 July 2015 |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted, however, that the most recent work by Kolb that Smith cites is from 2005, and he does not address the changes in the 2015 edition of Kolb's book ''Experiential Learning''.&lt;ref name="Kolb"/&gt;

===Other critiques===
Coffield and his colleagues and Mark Smith are not alone in their judgements. [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]], a UK think tank, published a report on learning styles prepared by a group chaired by [[David Hargreaves (academic)|David Hargreaves]] that included [[Usha Goswami]] from the [[University of Cambridge]] and David Wood from the [[University of Nottingham]]. The Demos report said that the evidence for learning styles was "highly variable", and that practitioners were "not by any means always frank about the evidence for their work".&lt;ref name="Hargreaves"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beere |first1=Jackie |last2=Swindells |first2=Maggie |last3=Wise |first3=Derek |last4=Desforges |first4=Charles |last5=Goswami |first5=Usha |authorlink5=Usha Goswami |last6=Wood |first6=David |last7=Horne |first7=Matthew |last8=Lownsbrough |first8=Hannah |last9=Hargreaves |first9=David |authorlink9=David Hargreaves (academic) |date=2005 |title=About learning: report of the Learning Working Group |location=London |publisher=[[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] |isbn=1841801402 |oclc=59877244 |url=http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/aboutlearning}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

Cautioning against interpreting neuropsychological research as supporting the applicability of learning style theory, John Geake, Professor of Education at the UK's [[Oxford Brookes University]], and a research collaborator with [[Oxford University]]'s Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, commented: "We need to take extreme care when moving from the lab to the classroom. We do remember things visually and aurally, but information isn't defined by how it was received."&lt;ref name="Revell"&gt;{{cite news|last=Revell |first=Phil |date=30 May 2005 |title=Each to their own |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/egweekly/story/0,,1495514,00.html |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304034655/http://education.guardian.co.uk/egweekly/story/0%2C%2C1495514%2C00.html |archivedate= 4 March 2007 |accessdate=9 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of [[Daniel T. Willingham]] also holds true to the idea that there is not enough evidence to support a theory describing the differences in learning styles amongst students. In his book ''Why Don't Students Like School'',&lt;ref name="Willingham"&gt;{{cite book |last=Willingham |first=Daniel T. |authorlink=Daniel T. Willingham |date=2009 |title=Why don't students like school?: a cognitive scientist answers questions about how the mind works and what it means for the classroom |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=[[Jossey-Bass]] |isbn=9780470279304 |oclc=255894389 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SDs8LZl41EC}}&lt;/ref&gt; he claims that a cognitive styles theory must have three features: "it should consistently attribute to a person the same style, it should show that people with different abilities think and learn differently, and it should show that people with different styles do not, on average, differ in ability."&lt;ref name="Willingham"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}} That being said, he concludes that there are no theories that have these three crucial characteristics, not necessarily implying that cognitive styles don't exist but rather stating that psychologists are unable to "find them".&lt;ref name="Willingham"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2015}}

===2009 APS critique===
In late 2009, the journal ''[[Psychological Science in the Public Interest]]'' of the [[Association for Psychological Science]] (APS) published a report on the scientific validity of learning styles practices.&lt;ref name="Pashler"/&gt; The panel of experts that wrote the article, led by [[Harold Pashler]] of the [[University of California, San Diego]], concluded that an adequate evaluation of the learning styles hypothesis—the idea that optimal learning demands that students receive instruction tailored to their learning styles—requires a particular kind of study. Specifically, students should be grouped into the learning style categories that are being evaluated (e.g., visual learners vs. verbal learners), and then students in each group must be randomly assigned to one of the learning methods (e.g., visual learning or verbal learning), so that some students will be "matched" and others will be "mismatched". At the end of the experiment, all students must sit for the same test. If the learning style hypothesis is correct, then, for example, visual learners should learn better with the visual method, whereas auditory learners should learn better with the auditory method. As disclosed in the report, the panel found that studies utilizing this essential research design were virtually absent from the learning styles literature. In fact, the panel was able to find only a few studies with this research design, and all but one of these studies were negative findings—that is, they found that the same learning method was superior for all kinds of students.&lt;ref name="Pashler"/&gt; Examples of such negative findings include the research of Laura J. Massa and [[Richard E. Mayer]],&lt;ref name="Massa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Massa |first1=Laura J. |last2=Mayer |first2=Richard E. |authorlink2=Richard E.

Furthermore, the panel noted that, even if the requisite finding were obtained, the benefits would need to be large, and not just statistically significant, before learning style interventions could be recommended as cost-effective. That is, the cost of evaluating and classifying students by their learning style, and then providing customized instruction would need to be more beneficial than other interventions (e.g., one-on-one tutoring, after school remediation programs, etc.).&lt;ref name="Pashler"/&gt;{{rp|116–117}}

As a consequence, the panel concluded, "at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number."&lt;ref name="Pashler" /&gt;{{rp|105}}

The article incited critical comments from some defenders of learning styles. ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' reported that [[Robert Sternberg]] from [[Tufts University]] spoke out against the paper: "Several of the most-cited researchers on learning styles, Mr. Sternberg points out, do not appear in the paper's bibliography."&lt;ref name="Glenn"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Glenn |first=David |date=15 December 2009 |title=Matching teaching style to learning style may not help students |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Matching-Teaching-Style-to/49497/ |accessdate=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This charge was also discussed by ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', which reported that Pashler said, "Just so... most of [the evidence] is 'weak'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holden |first=Constance |date=8 January 2010 |title=Learning with style |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=327 |issue=5692 |pages=129 |url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/Learning_With_Style-Science.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.327.5962.129-b}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Chronicle'' reported that even [[David A. Kolb]] partly agreed with Pashler; Kolb said: "The paper correctly mentions the practical and ethical problems of sorting people into groups and labeling them. Tracking in education has a bad history."&lt;ref name="Glenn"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2792">The '''Mediterranean Mathematics Competition''' (also: '''Peter O’Halloran Memorial''') is a [[mathematics competition]] for school students, taking place annually since 1998. All countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea are allowed to participate, as well as, if invited, their neighbouring countries. The contest, short-labelled "Mediterranean" is commonly regarded as the hardest amongst the mathematical student contests, including the [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]].

== Motto ==
The Mediterranean Competition's goals are:&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;Offizielles Regeldokument: http://mural.uv.es/rorunu/cmm/bases/Bases05ing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Discovery, development and challenge of mathematically gifted students
* Establishment of friendly and cooperative relationships between students and teachers of various [[mediterranean]] countries
* Creation of a possibility for international exchange about school practices
* Support for the engagement in solving [[Mathematical Olympiad|mathematical olympiad problems]], as well as the dealing with other mathematical problems, also in non participating countries

== Rules ==
The contest is conducted separately in every country. Each participating country can let an unrestricted number of students write the contest, but only the results of the top ten, according to national evaluation, can be submitted for international ranking. Every of these is awarded a certificate either of participation or merit, whereas the levels of merit - Gold, Silver, Bronze and Honorable Mention – are awarded similarly to the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]. The participants have to be less than 20 years of age and may not have enrolled in a university study or a comparable educative scheme.&lt;ref name="rules" /&gt;

== History ==
The Mediterranean Competition initially took place in 1998, created and until today organized by Spanish Francisco Bellot Rosado. In the first year, only three problems were to be solved. However from the second year on, the contest consisted of four problems each, with an overall contest time of four hours.&lt;ref&gt;http://imomath.com/index.php?options=Med&amp;mod=23&amp;ttn=Mediterranean&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a faulty problem has been given for the first time, an [[inequation]] to be proven was wrong.

The '''National Equity Project'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalequityproject.org/|title=Home - National Equity Project|website=nationalequityproject.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, formerly known as the '''Bay Area Coalition for Equitable Schools'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bridgespan.org/insights/library/strategy-development/bay-area-coalition-for-equitable-schools-achie|title=Bay Area Coalition for Equitable Schools: Achieving Strategic Clarity|last=Newsome|first=Don Howard, John|website=www.bridgespan.org|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''BayCES''', is an [[education reform]] organization that specializes in [[leadership development]] and changing culture and conditions in order to further [[Equity (economics)|equity]] objectives. It is a coaching and consulting organization based in [[Oakland, California]]; its name change in July 2010. The name was changed as the organization had expanded into new regions and began offering new services. In addition to schools, they also work with many districts and nonprofits on [[educational equity]] initiatives.

The stated purpose of the organization is to create the conditions for better educational experiences, outcomes, and life options for historically underserved students.  It is best known for its leadership in Oakland [[Small schools movement|small school]] reform&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edutopia.org/oaklands-big-plans-small-schools|title=Oakland's Big Plans: Small-School Reform {{!}} Edutopia|work=Edutopia|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which led to the creation of over 40 new small schools in one of the largest, most successful in terms of district [[Academic Performance Index (California public schools)|Academic Performance Index]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arusd.org/domain/6|title=Academic Performance Index (API) / Academic Performance Index (API)|website=www.arusd.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (API) increases, and most community-driven school reform efforts in the country.

==Early History and Small Schools Work==
The National Equity Project began in 1991 as a regional office of the [http://www.essentialschools.org/ Coalition for Essential Schools], then based at [[Brown University]].  In 1995, it was founded as an independent 501(c)3 [[non-profit organization]] called the Bay Area Coalition for Essential Schools, or BayCES.

In 1998, under the leadership of Executive Director Steve Jubb, BayCES changed its name to the Bay Area Coalition for ''Equitable'' Schools to emphasize its focus on addressing [[Achievement gap in the United States|achievement disparities]] among student groups that they argued arise from [[racism]], [[classism]], language bias, and other forms of [[systemic bias]]. From 1995-1999, the organization coached over a dozen comprehensive [[high school]]s in the wider Bay Area to help them enact the practices of essential schools, and to put the values of equity in practice, meaning to shift practices and re-allocate resources to help students of color, low-income students and other vulnerable students improve their academic performance. They also developed an increasingly sophisticated coaching methodology in response to the challenges of facilitating significant change in urban schools.

In 1998 the Project, then BayCES, first partnered with [http://www.oaklandcommunity.org/ Oakland Community Organizations] (OCO) to plan a small schools initiative in Oakland. OCO activists were working with parents who were frustrated with overcrowded, dilapidated, low-performing [[school]]s, and saw small schools in the northeast, as detailed in books and articles by [[Deborah Meier]] and others, as a way to reduce overcrowding and anonymity and improve the quality of teaching and learning.

===BayCES' Role in Oakland School Reform===
In 2000, BayCES partnered with the [[Oakland Unified School District]] (OUSD) and Oakland Community Organizations (OCO) to write and implement a small schools policy.  The New Small Autonomous Schools (NSAS) movement was initiated by parents, teachers, and activists committed to improving education in Oakland, which had a long history of poor urban school conditions including high dropout rates, school overcrowding and violence, and teacher turnover. No new school had been built in Oakland in the 30 years before this policy was passed. These egregious conditions prevailed in the mostly Black and Latino flatlands{{clarify|date=June 2016}} while high quality schools served the mostly White hills.

In the reform, OCO organized the community and BayCES provided education and project management expertise. BayCES created a Small Schools Incubator to help school design teams create new schools.  Design teams included teachers, leaders, parents, and sometimes students.  The Project drafted a [http://www.smallschoolsproject.org/PDFS/oaklandpolicy.pdf New Small Autonomous Schools policy] that was passed by the Oakland School Board, authorizing the creation of a network of 10 new small schools. While the original plan in the NSAS policy was to create 10 new small schools, the reform accelerated when (1) the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] made large grants totaling $40 million to support the small school reform (other national and mostly local funders joined forces), and (2) the district was taken over by the California Department of Education because of a district fiscal crisis.  A State Administrator, Randolph Ward, replaced the superintendent Dennis Chaconas, and plans were made to convert several comprehensive high and middle schools into small schools sharing the old campuses.  New small school creation became a district strategy for providing quality schools in every neighborhood. The Executive Director of BayCES, Steve Jubb, was appointed as one of two leaders (with Katrina Scott-George, Special Asst to the State Administrator) of the increasingly comprehensive reform, which included new systems of school-site budgeting, a split in the district central office between academics and school services (which became somewhat optional, enabling principals to make more decisions about procuring services for their school), and a network model of providing school services, among other innovations.  This district redesign became known as Expect Success.

In 2004, BayCES transitioned the Small Schools Incubator into the district central office (where it became the now defunct New School Development Group), and in 2006 it transferred management of Expect Success.  BayCES continued to coach most of the over 40 new small schools and provide consulting services to district leaders to promote the initial goals of the reform: a quality education for every child regardless of race or [[socioeconomic status]]. In a recent outside evaluation by Strategic Measurement, the new small schools in Oakland, compared to schools with similar demographics, demonstrated higher achievement, faster rates of student improvement, greatly improved graduation rates, and higher teacher, parent, and student satisfaction.

In 2004 Oakland was the most improved large district in the state of [[California]] in terms of district Academic Performance Index, which it has continued to be for the following six years. From 2000-8, the organization adopted a place-based strategy to focus on equity efforts in Oakland, [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], and stopped work in other places.

===BayCES Education Reform Approach===
BayCES works with schools to improve student achievement, close student achievement gaps, and improve school climate and functioning primarily through school [[coaching]].  School coaches focus on principal leadership and teacher team collaboration to help schools develop practices and capacities that research has shown to be effective in improving student learning.  As an affiliate of the [[Coalition of Essential Schools]], BayCES promotes essential school and small school characteristics such as personalized learning, project-based learning, differentiated instruction, advisory, and parent involvement.

A uncommon feature of BayCES coaching is that its coaches bring a strong "equity stance" to work in schools, meaning that they believe that schools tend to reproduce social injustices and inequality, and they strive to end education-based historic oppression. This social justice or "equity" approach often entails working with staff to improve [[cultural competence]] and encouraging school staff to have "courageous conversations" that confront racism and classism (personal and institutional) that may be contributing to poor educational results for children of color and low-income children.

==Recent Approaches and New Identity==
In 2007, a new Executive Director LaShawn Route Chatmon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.southerneducation.org/150-Menu-Test/Test-Pages/150-Profile/LaShawn-Route-Chatmon.aspx|title=LaShawn Route Chatmon - Southern Education Foundation|website=www.southerneducation.org|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was hired by the board after the retirement of Steve Jubb. Under LaShawn’s leadership, the organization began to focus increasingly on two levers for further improving [[education]] outcomes for vulnerable children: leadership development, and learning partnerships in instruction. In 2008-9, they developed new approaches and offered increased service to partners in these areas: Leading for Equity and Impact 2012 (Teaching for Equity). They sought and received major grants from new partner foundations to develop these areas: from the [[Kellogg Foundation]] to expand Leading for Equity programs, and from the [[Carnegie Corporation]] to develop and expand Impact 2012. The Impact 2012 has been evaluated by two external evaluators, including [[Stanford University]]'s SRN center, and was found to improve teacher usage of [[formative assessment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108018/chapters/Formative-Assessment@-Why,-What,-and-Whether.aspx|title=Formative Assessment: Why, What, and Whether|last=ASCD|website=www.ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improve academic performance significantly among targeted low-achieving students. The Leading for Equity program is currently being evaluated, and is informed by recent research on adaptive leadership, [[complexity science]] and systems change theory.

The organization's core [[insight]] is that people make change, and all education reform efforts need to take the development of people fully into account in order to succeed. In the National Equity Project analysis, most efforts rely on technical fixes or top-down mandates that do not develop people's capacity to carry out desired changes on behalf of vulnerable students. People's capacity has to be developed both in terms of technical [[Expert|proficiency]] (instruction, planning) and in terms of human relations, since collaboration, communication, and relationships are at the heart of any successful endeavor. In highly [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] school systems, these basic truths are often forgotten.

No longer limited to the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] or schools, the organization changed its name in 2010. As the National Equity Project, they have formally launched an effort to change the national conversation about achieving equity in education, and began working increasingly with community-wide initiatives to reduce disparities that result from [[structural racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.urban.org/features/structural-racism-america|title=Structural Racism in America|website=Urban Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Principles and Practice of Engineering exam''' is the examination required for one to become a [[Professional engineer|Professional Engineer]] (PE) in the United States.  It is the second exam required, coming after the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]].  

Upon passing the PE exam and meeting other eligibility requirements, that vary by state, such as education and experience, an engineer can then become registered in their State to stamp and sign engineering drawings and calculations as a PE.  

While the PE itself is sufficient for most engineering fields, some states require a further certification for structural engineers.  These require the passing of the [[Structural I exam]] and/or the [[Structural II exam]].

The PE Exam is created and scored by the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]] (NCEES). NCEES is a national non-profit organization composed of engineering and surveying licensing boards representing all states and U.S. territories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/About_NCEES.php] About NCEES&lt;/ref&gt;


==Exam format==
Exams are offered twice a year, once in April and once in October, and are discipline-specific.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/Exams/Pages/Exam_schedule.php/] NCEES; Exam Schedule&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the Structural exam, each exam is eight hours long, consisting of two 4-hour sessions administered in a single day with a lunch break. There are 40 multiple-choice questions per session. Several disciplines require a common morning breadth exam which broadly covers the discipline and then a more detailed afternoon depth exam where the test taker selects a more detailed area of the discipline. Other disciplines essentially have morning and afternoon breadth exams.&lt;ref name=format&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/Exams/PE_exam.php] Exam formats&lt;/ref&gt;

The Structural exam is 16 hours long and administered over two days, with two 4-hour sessions and a lunch break per day. Morning breadth sessions consist of 40 multiple-choice questions, while the afternoon depth sessions require essay responses. An examinee must earn a passing score on both days' exams in order to pass overall, but need not obtain those scores during the same administration of the exam.

==Disciplines==

PE exams are offered for the following disciplines:
*Agricultural and Biological Engineering (new specifications for the April 2015 exam)
*Architectural
*Chemical
*Civil: Construction (new specifications and design standards for the 2015 exams)
*Civil: Geotechnical (new specifications and design standards for the 2015 exams)
*Civil: Structural (new specifications and design standards for the 2015 exams)
*Civil: Transportation (new specifications and design standards for the 2015 exams)
*Civil: Water Resources and Environmental (new specifications and design standards for the 2015 exams)
*Control Systems
*Electrical and Computer: Computer Engineering
*Electrical and Computer: Electrical and Electronics
*Electrical and Computer: Power
*Environmental
*Fire Protection
*Industrial
*Mechanical: HVAC and Refrigeration
*Mechanical: Mechanical Systems and Materials
*Mechanical: Thermal and Fluids Systems
*Metallurgical and Materials (new specifications and design standards for the 2015 exams)
*Mining and Mineral Processing
*Naval Architecture and Marine
*Nuclear
*Petroleum
*Software
*Structural&lt;ref name="NCEES PE"&gt;{{cite web|title=NCEES: PE Exam|url=http://ncees.org/exams/pe-exam/|website=NCEES|publisher=National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;(with design standards for the 2015 exams)

Unlike the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam, outside reference sources are allowed for the PE Exam. The general rule is that any such materials must be in some sort of permanent binding (book, three-ring, spiral, etc.); loose papers and notes are prohibited. No writing tools or scratch paper may be brought in, and only calculators specifically approved by NCEES may be used. Examinees are provided with mechanical pencils and may use the test booklet as scratch paper for solving problems.

==Pass rates==
The PE exam is a professional exam much like the examinations required for public accounting, law, and other professions for which protection of the public is of the utmost concern. Consequently exam candidates typically spend large amounts of time preparing for the exam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/exams/study_materials/] NCEES; Study Materials&lt;/ref&gt; Exam pass rates vary by discipline module and test date, for the April 2010 exam, the pass rates for first time test takers ranged from 85% (Naval Architecture) to 46% (Structural I). The pass rates for repeat test takers is considerably lower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncees.org/Exams/PE_exam.php] Recent Exam Pass Rates&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, the '''Seleksi Bersama Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri (Joint Entrance Selection of State Universities)''' or abbreviated '''SBMPTN''' is a college entrance exam for admission of new students in state universities using written examinations nationally, which has various advantages, both for college applicants, public universities, as well as national interests. For college applicants, written exams are very profitable because they are more efficient, cheaper, and flexible due to cross-regional mechanisms.

== History ==
Based on its history, the beginning of SBMPTN implementation starts from the implementation of '''Seleksi Nasional Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri''' through written test (SNMPTN Tulis) held in 2008. At that time, SNMPTN is organized by [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Dirjen Dikti Kemendikbud]] (Directorate General of Higher Education of Ministry of Education and Culture). But since 2013 submitted to the Majelis Rektor Perguruan Tinggi Negeri Indonesia (MRPTNI). Based on the very long experience in executing the selection of new admissions through written examination, in 2013, MRPTNI held a written test as one form of admission to PTN in addition to SNMPTN. This test put forward the principle of trust and togetherness is called '''Seleksi Bersama Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri''' (SBMPTN).

Written exams use test questions developed in such way that meet the requirements for validity, difficulty level, and sufficient distinguishing features. The written exam of SBMPTN is designed to measure the general capabilities that allegedly determine the success of prospective students in all courses, namely higher-order thinking, which includes academic potential, mastery of basic subject areas: the field of Saintek (Sains dan Teknologi or Soshum (Sosial dan Humaniora) fields. In addition to taking a written exam, participants who choose the course of Arts and / or Sports are required to take a skill exam.

==Participating Universities==
The number of state universities incorporated into SBMPTN for the first time in 2013 is as much as 62 state universities and by 2015 it is estimated to increase to 77 state universities. This is caused by the number of new colleges and Islamic universities, which previously was in the Kementerian Agama (Ministry of Religious Affair) then delegated to the Kementerian Ristek dan Dikti (Ministry of Research and Technology and the Directorate of Higher Education).

'''The Knirk &amp; Gustafson Instructional Design Model''' is a three-stage instructional model, that was developed by Frederick G. Knirk and Kent L. Gustafson in the book “Instructional technology: a systematic approach to education” in 1986. The aforesaid book was written for those who do not necessarily have a background in curriculum, or instructional design (Jurkowitz, 1986). As such, the book and specifically the model cater for their needs through a marriage of familiar theory and practice but also highlight the systematic and effective use of instructional technology in instructional design and development (Jurkowitz, 1986).

== The Developers of the Instructional Design Model ==

=== Frederick G. Knirk ===
Frederick Knirk is a profound author in the field of education and instructional design. His books include Instructional Technology – A Book of Readings, Designing Productive Learning Environments, and Micro-Computer Video Games and Spatial Visualization Acquisition. He also co-wrote the book Instructional technology: a systematic approach to education with Dr. Kent L Gustafson. This book highlights the innovative Knirk and Gustafson Instructional Design Model.

=== Kent L. Gustafson ===
Kent Gustafson was a professor at the University of Georgia and retired in 2001. He received his Doctoral degree from the Michigan State University in 1969 and served at that university for 11 years but served at the University of Georgia for 20 years (Reeves, 2002), some of which as the chair of the Department of Instructional Technology. Before earning his PhD, he received his master's degree from the University of Massachusetts in 1965 (Reeves, 2002). This degree preceded the undergraduate degree earned in 1961 at the Worcester State University and his passion in the teaching of high school mathematics (Reeves, 2002).  According to the Georgia State University (n.d.) Dr Gustafson’s interests were on topics Performance Support Systems and over the years he has issued numerous books on instructional technology and education. These books include Instructional Technology: A Systematic Approach to Education, Instructional Design: Principles and Applications, Survey of Instructional Development Models among others.

== The Characteristics of an Instructional Design Model ==
Regardless of the instructional design model used, all models must possess certain characteristics for it to be effective. These characteristics highlight the instructional design model’s ability to be learner-centred, goal-oriented, focused on similar presentations as in the real world, focused on results that can be measured and validated, empirical and can encompass a team effort (Gustafson &amp; Branch, 2002).

== The Knirk &amp; Gustafson Instructional Design Model ==
The Kirk &amp; Gustafson [[Instructional Design]] Model is done in three phases: the problem determination stage, the design stage and the developmental stage. This is one stage less than the popular [[ADDIE Model|ADDIE model]] that also entails an additional evaluation phase as an overarching stage (Gustafson &amp; Branch, 2002). Each of the three phases in the Knirk and Gustafson Instructional and Design Model can be broken into specific objectives in order to complete the required project.

=== The Problem Determination Stage ===
The Problem determination stage is the first stage in the Kirk and Gustafson Instructional Design Model and focuses on two processes: the identification of the problem, the performance gaps and the primary goals (Pappas, 2015), and the setting of goals (Sortrakul &amp; Denphaisarn, 2009).  This stage allows the instructional designer to conduct a needs assessment and task analysis to determine the objectives that are required to solve the problem and create general instructional goals (Nimbkar &amp; Sonali, 2013) as well as decide which methods are suitable to lessen a performance deficiency (Barbazette, 2006). Determining the Learner’s Entry Behavior is critical to this process as it relates to the knowledge base of the learner, their communication skills, their learning styles and their health and wellbeing (Nimbkar &amp; Sonali, 2013). It also highlights the issues to be addressed via the needs assessment and task analysis (Pappas, 2015). Finally, the Problem Determination stage aids in the organization of instructional development, by planning, organizing, coordinating, evaluating and reporting on the results of the aforesaid assessments and analysis (Nimbkar &amp; Sonali, 2013) in order to pick a suitable method for design.

=== The Design Stage ===
The Design Stage is the second stage in The Knirk and Gustafson Instructional Design Model and its focuses on the development of a choice of objectives and strategies (Sortrakul &amp; Denphaisarn, 2009) to solve the problem highlighted in the problem determination stage. Along with aforesaid choices, suitable activities, materials and multimedia components are needed to resolve the problem and seal the performance gap (Pappas, 2015) (Nimbkar &amp; Sonali, 2013). These objective may follow the ABCD model while being terminal and enabling (Nimbkar &amp; Sonali, 2013). It is important to consult the opinions of Subject Matter Experts in the selection and gathering of media, the refining of objectives among other designing processes (Pappas, 2015).

=== The Development Stage ===
The Development Stage is the third and final stage in the Knirk and Gustafson Model and entails the creation and development of training materials, conducting of tests by users and the making of essential improvements towards the final product (Pappas, 2015). The creation of materials is normally a result of unsuitable ones that may be existence (Sortrakul &amp; Denphaisarn, 2009), and even the new models require evaluation for the situation (Nimbkar &amp; Sonali, 2013). Prototyping and focus groups may be necessary to produce an efficient and effective result (Pappas, 2015) as it going to a series of analysis before the official implementation (Nimbkar &amp; Sonali, 2013).

=== Advantages of the Knirk and Gustafson Model ===
The Knirk and Gustafson Instructional Design Model has a simplistic design as it is done in three main phases (İşman, Çağlar, Dabaj, &amp; Ersözlü, 2005). However, the model can be used successfully by the experts and beginners alike. The Hannifin and Peck Model also uses three phases but does not have separate phases (Pappas, 2015) as it constantly uses an evaluation and revision phases though the three phases (Qureshi, 2004). This makes the Hannifin and Peck model unsuitable for beginners but maintains a focus on the core functions like the Knirk and Gustafson model (Qureshi, 2004). Also, the Knirk and Gustafson model is effective for the planning and implementation of unit and lesson plans (Kowalski, 2012). Additionally, the Knirk and Gustafson model allows each step of the process to closer to resolving the wider problems in the organization, shortening the gap in skills, and achieving the requirements of the learners (Pappas, 2015).

=== Disadvantages of the Knirk and Gustafson Model ===
According to the Online Academic Community of the University of Victoria, the Knirk and Gustafson Instructional Design Model is excellent in simplicity but it misses steps of revision and evaluation during the beginning and intermediate steps. As such, when revision may become necessary in the implementation, one may have to review the former steps to produce an effective result (Kowalski, 2012).

Secondly, the University of Victoria highlights the Knirk and Gustafson Model’s inability to consider the student’s learning style and behavioural traits in the problem identification stage. The identification of the aforementioned factors will aid in the development of an appropriate solution.

Lastly, the University of Victoria points out that although the each stage is independent, a cross-related design would have made the process better as it would promote continued inter-relations between the processes and the content to be designed.

=== Applications of the Knirk &amp; Gustafson Instructional Design Model ===
The University of Victoria see the Knirk and Gustafson model as an effective and efficient for short courses that requires little consistency. Additionally, the instructional design model is suitable for the eLearning platform where media and technology are heavily involved (Pappas, 2015).  Finally, this model’s is excellent for simulations in the learning design field (Sortrakul &amp; Denphaisarn, 2009).

==''Mrs. Bush’s Story Time''==
In 2010, The Malvern School hosted a school-wide event based on First Lady [[Barbara Bush]]’s pro-literacy radio program "Mrs. Bush’s Story Time." Created by the Philadelphia non-profit organization Children’s Literacy Initiative, hosted by Mrs. Bush, and broadcast nationwide by ABC Radio Networks, ‘’Mrs. Bush’s Story Time’’ featured celebrities reading classic children’s stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kbtx.com/home/headlines/Former_First_Lady_Launches_Pre-School_Reading_Program_147269545.html|title=Former First Lady Launches Pre-School Reading Program|publisher=Gray Television|date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“As you know, literacy has been my life-long passion, and I am so proud of the work that my foundation has done to advance the cause and encourage people of all ages to experience the joy of reading,” said Mrs. Bush. “I am especially pleased that the Malvern School is using the broadcasts as educational events for their students, and I wish them the best of luck,” she added. “Malvern School First in Nation to Re-Launch Mrs. Bush's Story Time.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malvernschool.com/bushstorytime_malvern10192010.pdf|title=Malvern School First in Nation to Re-Launch Mrs. Bush’s Story Time|publisher=  The Malvern School|date=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation==
Since 2008, The Malvern School has been a sponsor of The Alex Scott – Stand for Hope Phone Bank on CBS 3-Philadelphia and the [[Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation]] (ALSF) by raising additional funds and awareness in the fight against pediatric cancer. Every year since 2008 each Malvern School location hosts an Alex’s Lemonade Stand Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesherald.com/article/20120718/NEWS01/120719496/malvern-school-hosts-alex-s-lemonade-stand|title=Malvern School Hosts Alex’s Lemonade Stand|author=Gene Walsh|publisher=The Times Herald|date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Thomas Kane earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in economics from the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1983, followed by an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in economics from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1986, a [[Master of Public Policy|M.P.P.]] and [[Ph.D.]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1988 and 1991, the latter with a thesis on the determinants of Afro-Americans' entry to college during the 1970s and 1980s. After his graduation, Kane became an assistant professor of public policy at Harvard's [[Kennedy School of Government]], where he was promoted to associate professor in 1997. While at Harvard, Kane also begun working as a research associate at the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]], with which he still maintains an affiliation, held appointment as visiting fellow at [[Brookings Institution]] and as national fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]], and worked as senior economist for labour, education and welfare on the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] under [[Bill Clinton]] (1995-96). In 2001, Kane became the Professor of Policy Studies and Economics at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], though he returned to an appointment as Professor of Education and Economics at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] and as faculty director of the [[Harvard Center for Education Policy Research]] in 2005, where he has worked ever since. From 2008 to 2012, Kane was the deputy director of the U.S. education branch of the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]. In 2013, the Harvard Graduate School of Education honoured him with the position of Walter H. Gale Professor of Education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gse.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/faculty/documents/thomas-kane-71512.pdf Curriculum vitae of Thomas Kane from the website of Harvard University.

== Research ==

Thomas Kane has conducted extensive research on [[education in the United States]], ranging from [[K-12 education]] to [[higher education]] and covering topics such as the effectiveness of [[charter school]]s, teacher education and certification, [[education policy]], [[affirmative action]], and education finance. Throughout much of his research, Kane has cooperated with [[Douglas Staiger]] ([[Dartmouth College]]).

=== Research on college education and the impact of family background ===

Since his Ph.D., Kane has researched the determinants of enrollment into college in the U.S. and the impact of family background on it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.russellsage.org/sites/all/files/u4/Kane.pdf Kane, T.J. (2004). College-going and inequality. ''Social Inequality'', No. 354.]&lt;/ref&gt; Examining [[Afro-American]]s' college enrollment rate in the U.S. during the 1980s, Kane attributes its 1980-84 decline to the growth of direct college costs and their 1984-87 rebound to the strong growth in the average parental education of Afro-American youth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v102y1994i5p878-911.html Kane, T.J. (1994). College entry by blacks since 1970: The role of college costs, family blackground, and the returns to education. ''Journal of Political Economy'', 102(5), pp. 878-911.]&lt;/ref&gt; Analysing the impact of [[Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke|affirmative action admitting the use of racial preferences in college admissions]], Kane observes that the use of such action seems to be limited to the most selective fifth of colleges and that the net relationship between college selectivity, earnings and college graduation rates is positive for minority and other students, going on to argue that colleges' student bodies wouldn't be as racially diverse without [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/ohslj59&amp;div=32&amp;id=&amp;page= Kane, T.J. (1998). Racial and ethnic preferences in college admissions. ''Ohio State Law Journal'', 59(971).]&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, Kane and [[David T. Ellwood]] find that the college enrollment rates of youth displaying similar levels of academic preparation for college still vary considerably depending on their parents' income and education, with the gaps having widened in the 1980s and 1990s due to the growth in the returns to college education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1549036 Ellwood, D., Kane, T.J. (2000). Who is getting a college education? Family background and the growing gaps in enrollment. In: Sheldon, D., Waldfogel, J. (eds.). ''Securing the Future: Investing in Children from Birth to College.'' New York: Russell Sage Foundation, pp. 283-324.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, together with [[Christopher Avery]], Kane has investigated the impact of [[Boston]]'s College Opportunity and Career Help (COACH) programme, a programme that has [[Harvard University]] students help public high school students make career plans and submit college and financial aid applications, and found that (i) high school students tend to overestimate both the tuition rates and rates of return to college education independent of their socioeconomic background, (ii) that the complexity of the financial aid and college application processes often discourages low-income students even if they are qualified and interested in a college education, (iii) and that many public high school students reporting an interest in college education either don't believe they are qualified and/or never wanted to pursue college education anyway.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/h/nbr/nberch/10104.html Avery, C., Kane, T.J. (2004). Student perceptions of college opportunities: The Boston COACH program. In: Hoxby, C.M. (ed.). ''College choices: The Economics of Where to Go, When to Go, and How to Pay For It''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 355-394.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on school accountability, competition, quality and charter schools ===

Another substantial body of Kane's research addresses the topics of school accountability, school choice and quality, and the effectiveness of [[charter school]]s. With regard to school accountability, Kane and Staiger have been critical of test-based school accountability systems, arguing that the imprecision and volatility of school test scores (e.g. due to [[sampling variation]] or sample size-invariant idiosyncrasies) often used as a basis for such systems may weaken or pervert incentives. Instead, they advocate for extending rewards and bonuses even to schools without extremely high scores to effectively incentivize large schools, not making them contingent on improvements in each racial group to avoid disadvantages for integrated schools, to use improvements across both years and outcomes as a basis, and to account for the impact of test score volatility and the choice of baseline year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20067246?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Kane, T.J., Staiger, D.O. (2002). Volatility in school test scores: Implications for test-based accountability systems. ''Brookings Papers on Education Policy'', pp. 235-283.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they note that, even in states with strong financial incentives, the marginal reward to schools for raising student performance is dwarved by the expected increase in students' labour market value due to such improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jecper/v16y2002i4p91-114.html Kane, T.J., Staiger, D.O. (2002). The promise and pitfalls of using imprecise school accountability measures. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 16(4), pp. 91-114.]&lt;/ref&gt; In research with [[Justine Hastings]], Kane and Staiger study the determinants of families' school choices and the effectiveness of public school choice plans, finding that parents prefer close-by schools and their valuation of high-performing schools increases in their own academic ability, though such preferences also display strong idiosyncrasies. Moreover, they find that public school choice plans plans are likely to yield a one-sided increase in parental demands for better school quality at already high-performing schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hastings |first=J. S. |last2=Kane |first2=T. J. |last3=Staiger |first3=D. O. |year=2005 |title=Parental preferences and school competition: Evidence from a public school choice program |work=NBER Working Paper No. 11805 |date=November 2005 |doi=10.3386/w11805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In further investigation, Kane, Staiger and Hastings observe that&amp;nbsp;— if offered public school choice plans - parents from ethnic minorities trade off high-performing schools against schools wherein their minority is highly represented, whereas parents with high socioeconomic status tend to focus on school performance alone; this results in lower demand for better school quality at schools that serve mostly minority families or families with low socioeconomic status, implying that public school choice plans may exacerbate [[educational inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |url=http://justinehastings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/HKS_Combined_201006.pdf |last=Hastings |first=J. |last2=Kane |first2=T. J. |last3=Staiger |first3=D. O. |date=May 2009 |title=Heterogeneous preferences and the efficacy of public school choice |work=Unpublished working paper }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in research with [[David Deming]], Kane, Staiger and Hastings find that college attainment among lottery participants assigned to their first-choice public school increases due to these schools being generally of higher quality, though the gains in college attainment are strongly concentrated among girls since these tend to take better advantage of the improved learning environment (e.g. via preparatory courses for [[college]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/42920726 Deming, D.J. et al. (2014). School choice, school quality, and postsecondary attainment. ''American Economic Review'', 104(3), pp. 991-1013.]&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the effectiveness of [[charter school]]s, Kane, [[Joshua Angrist|Angrist]], [[Susan Dynarski|Dynarski]], [[Parag Pathak|Pathak]], and Christopher Walters find that attending a [[Knowledge is Power Program|KIPP]] [[charter school]] increases the average achievement of students by 0.36 standard deviations in math and 0.12 standard deviations in reading per year spent in such a school, with most of the gains accruing to students with special needs and limited English proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v100y2010i2p239-43.html Angrist, J.D. et al. (2010). Inputs and impacts in charter schools: KIPP Lynn. ''American Economic Review'', 100(2), pp. 239-243.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pam.21647 Angrist, J.D. et al. (2012). Who benefits from KIPP? ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 31(4), pp. 837-860.]&lt;/ref&gt; In further research with Atila Abdulkadiroglu, they also find that being assigned by lottery to a Boston charter school strongly and significantly raises middle and high school students' test scores, whereas being assigned to a pilot school sometimes decreases test scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abdulkaridoglu |first=A. |first2=Joshua D. |last2=Angrist |first3=Susan M. |last3=Dynarski |first4=Thomas J. |last4=Kane |first5=Parag A. |last5=Pathak |year=2011 |title=Accountability and flexibility in public schools: Evidence from Boston's charters and pilots |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=126 |issue=2 |pages=699–748 |doi=10.1093/qje/qjr017 |display-authors=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Kane has also studied the relationship between school quality and housing prices: together with Staiger and Stephanie Riegg, he finds evidence that school boundaries systematically affect housing prices, though the impact is prone to overestimation and partly mediated by demographic characteristics and improvements in housing that are independent from school boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=42705497 |last=Kane |first=T. J. |last2=Riegg |first2=S. K. |last3=Staiger |first3=D. O. |year=2006 |title=School quality, neighborhoods, and housing prices |journal=American Law and Economics Review |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=183–212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on teacher effectiveness ===

The effectiveness of teachers constitutes a third area of Kane's research. Criticizing the lack of improvement in U.S.-American teachers' effectiveness, Kane, Staiger and [[Robert J. Gordon]] suggest to (i) reduce entry barriers to teaching, (ii) increase barriers to tenure, (iii) award bonuses to highly effective teachers willing to teach at disadvantaged schools, (iv) measure teachers' job performance, and (v) track student performance and teacher effectiveness over time.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, R.J., Kane, T.J., Staiger, D. (2008). Identifying effective teachers using performance on the job. In: Furman, J., Bordoff, J.E. (eds.). ''Path to Prosperity: Hamilton Project Ideas on Income Security, Education, and Taxes''. Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing different methods to estimate teachers' impacts on student achievement, Kane and Staiger argue for the impact to be estimated most accurately if both prior student test scores and mean classroom characteristics are considered; they find that teacher-specific effects fade by about half each year after teachers' initial assignment to a class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kane |first=T. J. |last2=Staiger |first2=D. O. |year=2008 |title=Estimating teacher impacts on student achievement: An experimental evaluation |work=NBER Working Paper No. 14607 |date=December 2008 |doi=10.3386/w14607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in further work with [[Jonah Rockoff]], Kane and Staiger find that - unlike teachers' performance in classrooms during the first two years - teacher certification poorly predicts teachers' future effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecoedu/v27y2008i6p615-631.html Kane, T.J., Rockoff, J.E., Staiger, D.O. (2008). What does certification tell us about teacher effectiveness? Evidence from New York City. ''Economics of Education Review'', 27(6), pp. 615-631.]&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Brian Jacob]], Kane, Staiger and Rockoff also observe that composite measures of teachers' cognitive and non-cognitive skills predict well teachers' effectiveness, though individual measures do not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brian-jacob.com/uploads/6/8/3/7/68371777/2can_you_recognize_an_effective_teacher_when_you_recruit_one.pdf Rockoff, J.E. et al. (2011). Can you recognize an effective teacher when you recruit one? ''Education Finance and Policy'', 6(1), pp. 43-74.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in joint work with John Tyler, Eric Taylor and Amy Wooten, Kane finds classroom-based measures of teaching effectiveness to be good predictors of student achievement (though some teaching practices predict achievement more than others), leading him to suggest that teacher evaluations should use both classroom observations and student test scores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/46/3/587.short Kane, T.J. et al. (2011). Identifying effective classroom techniques using student achievement data. ''Journal of Human Resources'', 46(3), pp. 587-613.]&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Kane has published extensively on the measurement of teacher effectiveness as part of his involvement in the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]]'s [[Measuring Effective Teaching]] (MET) project. In particular, Kane and Staiger found that (i) measures of teaching effectiveness such as [[Framework for Teaching|FFT]], [[Classroom Assessment Scoring System|CLASS]], [[Protocol for Language Arts Teaching Observations|PLATO]], [[Mathematical Quality of Instruction|MQI]], and [[UTeach Teacher Observation Protocol|UTOP]] are positively correlated with student achievement gains; (ii) the reliable assessment of teacher's practices necessitates the averaging of scores over multiple observations, (iii) the combination of observation scores with evidence of student achievement gains and student feedback is more predictive and reliable; (iv) unlike teaching experience and graduate degrees, the combined measure identifies teachers with larger gains on the state tests; and (v) teachers performing strongly on the combined measure also performed well in terms of their students' in-class effort, enjoyment and gains in terms of math comprehension and [[literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED540960.pdf Kane, T.J., Staiger, D.O. (2012). ''Gathering Feedback for Teaching: Combining High-Quality Observations with Student Surveys and Achievement Gains''. Washington, D.C.: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.]&lt;/ref&gt; Later research by Kane and his MET co-researchers Staiger, Daniel McCaffrey and Trey Miller confirmed that the measures of effective teaching assessed within the MET project successfully identified teachers who produced on average higher gains in student achievement, with the differences being roughly as large as what would have been predicted based on their effectiveness as measured in 2009-10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=E4C35E9165284DDA4741A6DA931BA0BB?doi=10.1.1.638.2716&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Kane, T.J. et al. (2013). Have we identified effective teachers? Validating measures of effective teaching using random assignment. Washington, D.C.: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.]&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of the findings of the MET project for the design of teacher evaluation systems are summarized in Kane's 2015 book ''Designing Teacher Evaluation Systems'' (with Kerri Kerr and Robert Pianta as co-authors).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wiley.com/en-eg/Designing+Teacher+Evaluation+Systems%3A+New+Guidance+from+the+Measures+of+Effective+Teaching+Project-p-9781119210856 Kane, T., Kerr, K., Pianta, R. (2015). ''Designing Teacher Evaluation Systems: New Guidance from the Measures of Effective Teaching Project.'' Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on the returns to and financing of postsecondary education ===

A fourth area of Kane's research regards the returns to and financing of postsecondary education. For example, he and [[Cecilia Rouse]] find that the labour market returns to 2- and 4-year college credits are similarly large - ca. 5% per year of college - and not due to [[signalling (economics)|signalling]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2118190 Kane, T.J., Rouse, C.E. (1995). Labor-market returns to two- and four-year college. ''American Economic Review'', 85(3), pp. 600-614.]&lt;/ref&gt;, and that U.S. [[community college]]s have played a key role in providing access to higher education to older, part-time or less well-prepared students, substantially raising aggregate educational attainment and even non-graduates' earnings, even for non-graduates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.13.1.63 Kane, T.J., Rouse, C.E. (1999). The community college: Educating students at the margin between college and work. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 13(1), pp. 63-84.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, together with Staiger, they also draw attention to misestimations in [[ordinary least squares|OLS]] and [[instrumental variables|IV]] estimates in the returns to schooling due to systematic misreporting of educational attainment by survey respondents if such attainment doesn't correspond to a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kane |first=T. J. |last2=Rouse |first2=C. E. |last3=Staiger |first3=D. |year=1999 |title=Estimating Returns to Schooling when Schooling is Misreported |work=NBER Working Paper No. 7235 |date=July 1999 |doi=10.3386/w7235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to the financing of postsecondary education, Kane finds that especially low-income youth are very sensitive to the price of college education, but also that means-tested grant programmes haven't been more effective in increasing the college enrollment of that target group than general tuition subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kane |first=T. J. |year=1995 |title=Rising Public College Tuition and College Entry: How Well Do Public Subsidies Promote Access to College? |work=NBER Working Paper No. 5164 |date=July 1995 |doi=10.3386/w5164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, in his evaluation of the [[Cal Grant]] (a means-tested financial aid for college), Kane finds that grant eligibility increases the college enrollment of financial aid applicants by 3-4 percentage points, especially for private [[California]]n 4-year colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kane |first=T. J. |year=2003 |title=A Quasi-Experimental Estimate of the Impact of Financial Aid on College-Going |work=NBER Working Paper No. 9703 |date=May 2003 |doi=10.3386/w9703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in his evaluation of the impact of the [[District of Columbia|D.C.]] Tuition Assistance Program, which has subsidized the tuition of D.C. residents attending public higher education institutions in nearby states since 2000, Kane finds that the programme has increased the number of [[Pell Grant|Pell grant]] recipients and college freshmen from D.C. by at least 15%, especially within the [[Afro-American]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/XLII/3/555.short Kane, T.J. (2007). Evaluating the impact of the D.C. tuition assistance grant program. ''Journal of Human Resources'', 42(3), pp. 555-582.]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these themes are taken up by Kane's 2010 book ''The Price of Admission'', wherein he criticizes the growing dependence of college enrollment on family income and the sometimes perverse interactions of state and federal policies for financial aid, and suggests a number of reforms to improve the effectiveness of public subsidies for college, such as limiting the eligibility of Pell grants to college freshmen and sophomores and providing a larger share of public college tuition subsidies based on students' post-college resources rather than parents' pre-college income and assets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/book/the-price-of-admission/ Kane, T.J.

Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, together with [[Peter Orszag]] and [[David Gunter]], Kane finds that higher education spending has been increasingly crowded out by other items of state budgets since the late 1970s, in particular [[Medicaid]], with [[business cycle|countercyclical]] reductions in higher education spending typically becoming permanent in the absence of procyclical increases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED476875.pdf Kane, T.J., Orszag, P.R., Gunter, D.L.

=== Miscellaneous ===

In their research on [[abortion]] in the U.S., Kane and Staiger find that restricting the access to abortion (e.g. via abortion clinic closures or restrictions on Medicaid funding) ''lowered'' teenage birth rates during the 1980s due to decreases in in-wedlock births (out-of-wedlock births were unaffected).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kane |first=T. J. |last2=Staiger |first2=D. |year=1996 |title=Teen Motherhood and Abortion Access |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=111 |issue=2 |pages=467–506 |doi=10.2307/2946685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Kane, Staiger, [[Phillip Levine]] and [[David Zimmerman]] find that the fertility rates in those states legalizing abortion decreased by 4% (11% if interstate abortions are taken into account), with most of the impact accruing to reduced births among teenage, middle-aged, non-White and/or unmarried women, thus suggesting that a reversal of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' might raise birth rates but be strongly undermined by abortions being legally performed out of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.89.2.199 |last=Levine |first=P.

Studying the potential of the German vocational training system for the U.S., Kane (together with Dietmar Harhoff) has argued that the conditions that U.S. employers would be less willing to invest into vocational training than in [[Germany]], leading him to doubt that the introduction of the German apprenticeship system would increase the earnings of comparable American youth and improve the school-to-work transitions of in particular minority youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harhoff |first=D. |last2=Kane |first2=T.

'''''Traders''''' is a [[business simulation game]] with a [[science fiction]] setting. It was created by [[André Wüthrich]] and published by Merit software in 1991. ''Traders'' as being inspired by ''[[M.U.L.E.]]'' was released for [[MS-DOS]], [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] home computers. Up to four players control characters, aliens known as Plubbers, make the most money in a commercial competition. Players grow fields, sell products, and raid other players.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A '''travelling menagerie''' was a touring group of [[showman|showmen]] and animal handlers who visited towns and cities with common and exotic animals.  The term "[[menagerie]]", first used in seventeenth century France, was primarily used to refer to [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] or royal animal collections.  Most visitors to travelling menageries would never have the opportunity to see such animals under other circumstances and their arrival in a town would cause great excitement.  The shows were both entertaining and educational; in 1872 ''[[The Scotsman]]'' described [[George Wombwell]]'s travelling menagerie as "[having] done more to familiarise the minds of the masses of our people with the denizens of the forest than all the books of natural history ever printed during its wandering existence."&lt;ref name="FHT"&gt;Page, Dave. [http://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/newsite/research/research-menageries.html Animal magic?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327053347/http://www.fairground-heritage.org.uk/newsite/research/research-menageries.html |date=2012-03-27 }}, The Fairground Heritage Trust. Accessed 1 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
In [[England]] travelling menageries had first appeared at the turn of the eighteenth century. In contrast to the aristocratic menageries, these travelling animal collections were run by showmen who met the craving for sensation of the ordinary population. These animal shows ranged in size but the largest was [[George Wombwell]]'s which, by 1839, totalled fifteen wagons. By 1880 Bostock and Wombwell's Royal National Menagerie had eighteen ″huge and spacious carriages″ and over six hundred beasts to take on the annual tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=V R Grand Annual Tour 1980|work=The Cornishman|issue=95|date=6 May 1880|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==
The first exotic animal known to have been exhibited in '''[[United States|America]]''' was a lion, in [[Boston]] in 1710, followed five years later in the same city by a camel.&lt;ref name="Kisling147-150"&gt;Kisling, Vernon N., "Zoological Gardens of the United States", in ''Zoo and Aquarium History: Ancient Collections to Zoological Gardens'', Vernon N. Kisling (ed.), CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2001, pp.147-150. {{ISBN|0-8493-2100-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sailor arrived in [[Philadelphia]] in August 1727 with another lion, which he exhibited in the city and surrounding towns for eight years.&lt;ref name="Hancocks86-87"&gt;Hancocks, David, ''A different nature: The paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future'', University of California Press, Berkeley, 2001, pp.86-87. {{ISBN|0-520-21879-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first elephant was imported from [[India]] to America by a ship’s captain, Jacob Crowninshield, in 1796. It was first displayed in [[New York City]] and travelled extensively up and down the East Coast.&lt;ref name="Kisling147-150" /&gt; In 1834 James and William Howes’ New York Menagerie toured [[New England]] with an [[elephant]], a [[rhinoceros]], a [[camel]], a [[zebra]], a [[gnu]], two [[tiger]]s, a [[polar bear]], and several [[parrot]]s and [[monkey]]s.&lt;ref name="Hoage98"&gt;Flint, Richard W., "American Showmen and European Dealers: Commerce in Wild Animals in Nineteeth Century", in ''New World, New Animals: From Menagerie to Zoological Park in the Nineteenth Century'', Hoage, Robert J. and Deiss, William A. (ed.), Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1996, p.98. {{ISBN|0-8018-5110-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

America's touring menageries slowed to a crawl under the weight of the depression of the 1840s and then to a halt with the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Only one travelling menagerie of any size existed after the war: [[Isaac A. Van Amburgh]]'s menagerie travelled the [[United States]] for nearly forty years. Unlike their [[Europe]]an counterparts, America's menageries and [[circus]]es had combined as single travelling shows, with one ticket to see both. This increased the size and the diversity of their collections. [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] advertised their shows as the "World's Greatest Menagerie".&lt;ref name=Hancocks86-87/&gt;

He was born in Gari, a small village in the Racha region of Georgia,  which was then part of the Russian Empire.

As a painter, Japaridze was one of the most important figures in the development of 20th-century Georgian visual arts. He enjoyed creating detailed portraits and is responsible for producing a series of portraits of prominent persons such as his 1949 pencil and pastel sketch of [[Vano Sarajishvili]], currently held at the [[Georgian State Museum of Theatre, Music, Cinema and Choreography]] in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia.

Japaridze was given a number of awards during his life, including Public Artist of Georgian SSR (1946), Honored Artist of Georgia (1943), Academician of the Georgian Academy of Arts (1958), Laureate of the [[Shota Rustaveli State Prize]] (1987), and Honored Citizen of Tbilisi (1982).

He was a chancellor of the [[Tbilisi State Academy of Arts]] from 1942 to 1948.

He died in Tbilisi in 1988. His former home in Tbilisi was turned into a museum in the same year.

The '''University of Havana''' or '''UH''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Universidad de La Habana'') is a university located in the [[Vedado]] district of [[Havana]], the capital of the [[Cuba|Republic of Cuba]]. Founded on January 5, 1728, the university is the oldest in Cuba, and one of the first to be founded in the [[Americas]]. Originally a religious institution, today the University of Havana has 15 faculties (colleges) at its Havana campus and distance learning centers throughout Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apistudyabroad.com/programs/cuba/havana/|title=Study Abroad in Havana|website=www.apistudyabroad.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Facultad de Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Computación.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Faculty of Math and Computer Science]]
[[File:Aula magna de UH.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Aula Magna]]
[[File:Universidad de la habana fachada.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Statue of [[Alma Mater]] at on the main steps of the university.]]
It was first called '''Real y Pontificia Universidad de San Gerónimo de la Habana''' (in [[English language|English]] ''Royal and Pontifical University of Saint Jerome of Havana).'' During those times, universities needed a royal or papal authorization in order to be created and thus the names ''Real y Pontificia''. The two men who gave that authorization to the university were [[Pope Innocent XIII]] and [[Philip V of Spain|King Philip V of Spain]].

In 1842, the university changed its status to become a secular, royal and literary institution. Its name became '''Real y Literaria Universidad de La Habana''' (in [[English language|English]], ''Royal and Literary University of Havana'') and later, when Cuba was a free republic, the name was changed to '''Universidad Nacional''' (in [[English language|English]], ''National University'').

The university had first been established in ''San Juan de Letrán'' (located in Villa de San Cristóbal in [[Old Havana]]) before it was transferred on May 1, 1902, to a hill in the [[Vedado]] area of [[Havana]]. The interiors of the building were decorated by Armando Menocal y Menocal. The seven frescos represent [[Medicine]], [[Science]], [[Art]], [[Thought]], [[Liberal Arts]], [[Literature]], and [[Law]]. At the main university entrance (shown above) there is a [[bronze]] [[statue]] of [[Alma Mater]] (meaning the "Nourishing mother" in [[Latin]]) that was created in 1919 by artist [[Mario Korbel]]. The model for the statue's face was lovely 16-year-old Feliciana "Chana" Villalón, the daughter of José Ramón Villalón y Sánchez, a professor of analytical mathematics at the University. Chana later married Juan Manuel Menocal (a distant relative of Armando Menocal), who went on to become the Dean of the Business School. Juan Manuel Menocal was a professor at the law school when [[Fidel Castro]] was a student there in the 1940s. [[Maria Rosa Menocal]], former Director of the Whitney Humanities Center at Yale, was the granddaughter of Chana and Juan Manuel Menocal. (See Alma Mater Witness of Time by Eduardo Heras León).

The main library "Rubén Martínez Villena" was established later in 1936.

After the government was taken over by [[Fulgencio Batista]] in 1952, the University became a center of anti-government protests. Batista closed the University in 1956.  From January 1, 1959, the date on which Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba, until January 1, 1962, the University went through a period of reformation to eliminate "anti-revolutionary ideas".

In 2002, [[Rutgers University–Camden]] and the University of Havana signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to formalize research and exchange opportunities for students and faculty.

The MOU was re-signed in October 2016 with the addition of encompassing all of [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], The State University of New Jersey.

==Organization==
The University of Havana is made up of 16 faculties ({{lang-es|facultades}}) and 14 research centers in a variety of fields, including [[economics]], [[sciences]], [[social science]] and [[humanities]]. In total, up to 25 specialties are taught at the university. Now, it has about 60,000 degree students in regular classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/where-to-study/north-america/cuba/guide|title=Study in Cuba|date=2012-11-07|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 16 faculties into which the university is divided:

* [[Natural Sciences]]
** Faculty of [[Biology]]
** Faculty of [[Pharmacy]] and [[Foods]]
** Faculty of [[Physics]]
** Faculty of [[Geography]]
** Faculty of [[Mathematics]] and [[Computer Science]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matcom.uh.cu/ www.matcom.uh.cu] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Faculty of [[Psychology]]
** Faculty of [[Chemistry]]
* [[Social Sciences]] and [[Humanities]]
** Faculty of [[Arts]] and [[Literature|Letters]]
** Faculty of [[Communication]]
** Faculty of [[Law]]
** Faculty of [[Philosophy]] and [[History]]
** Faculty of [[Foreign Languages]]
* [[Economic Sciences]]
** Faculty of [[Accounting]] and [[Finance]]
** Faculty of [[Economics]]
** Faculty of [[Tourism]]
* [[Distance Education]]

==Student organizations==

Before the Cuban Revolution of 1959, students joined different organizations, aligning themselves directly or indirectly with some political party. The strongest of all these organisations was the FEU (Federación Estudiantíl Universitaria or University Students Federation) created by [[Julio Antonio Mella]], a co-founder of the Cuban Communist Party in the 1920s. The European revolutionary tradition of college-based political activism that was practiced in Cuba and in many other Latin American countries and the alleged corruption of Cuban political parties at the time turned the FEU, a stronghold of communist ideology, into the most influential of Cuban political organizations before 1959. It was a major participant in the overthrowing of Cuban President [[Gerardo Machado]].  The FEU initiated the national general strike of 1933, resulting in the imprisonment of many of its members.  Founder [[Julio Antonio Mella]], himself had been killed at the hands of two assassins sent by Machado while exiled in Mexico in 1929

After the ''coup d'état'' by [[Fulgencio Batista]] in 1952, when free and democratic elections were suspended, the violent clashes between university students and Cuban police reached its extremes. Students known to be members of the FEU were violently tortured and killed in the streets of Havana, and the organization reacted with an irregular war in the city, aiming mainly to assassinate police officers of high rank, like the chief of the police in Havana, Blanco Rico, who was killed by 4 FEU members. After the assault on the [[Moncada barracks]]  by [[Fidel Castro]], an attorney who graduated from Havana University School of Law, and who had contacts in the FEU, the FEU became an ally of Castro's new [[July 26th Movement]], though there were discrepancies between the leaders in the form that the forthcoming revolution should be carried out. While Fidel Castro was hiding in the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains, the FEU, led by [[Jose Antonio Echeverria]], attempted to kill [[Fulgencio Batista]] in an armed assault at the Cuban Presidential Palace on March 13, 1957. Batista managed to escape, and many student assailants died in the action, as did Echeverria himself.  During the months that followed, the police executed many of the students that led the failed coup. President Batista ordered the university to be closed, and it remained so until Batista fled the country and Fidel Castro entered Havana in January 1959.

The Castro administration re-opened the university in 1959.

'''Wefarm''' is a [[peer-to-peer]] knowledge sharing platform for [[smallholding|smallholder farmers]]. Wefarm users can ask and answer farming questions and share farming tips, via [[SMS]] or online, enabling farmers in rural areas without internet access to share information. Wefarm is built around the principle that rural farming communities in [[developing country|developing countries]] have generations worth of knowledge to share, but lack the tools to do so. Wefarm provides an SMS service based around peer-to-peer, [[crowdsourcing]] of knowledge. Users ask a wide range of questions regarding farming techniques and share information around business ideas, or how to improve livelihoods.

== History and Pilots ==

The idea for Wefarm was born in 2010 out of a perceived need for greater access to information for the 500 million smallholder farmers in developing countries. Only approximately 10% of smallholder farmers have any access to the internet but it is thought that around 90% have access to basic mobile ‘feature’ phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/02/13/emerging-nations-embrace-internet-mobile-technology/ Emerging Nations Embrace Internet, Mobile Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenny Ewan, CEO of Wefarm, and Claire Rhodes, General Manager of the Cafédirect Producers Foundation (CPF), developed the idea for Wefarm together in 2010 as a project for CPF, a UK-registered charity that works with ~280,000 smallholder tea, coffee and cocoa farmers and their organisations on innovative, community driven projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://producersfoundation.org/about/ Cafédirect Producers Foundation - About Us]&lt;/ref&gt; They developed Wefarm together as a peer-to-peer knowledge sharing platform, giving smallholder farmers a way to access information from other farmers around the world through basic mobile phones and SMS.

Wefarm was piloted, tested and developed over 2011 and 2012 as a CPF project with funding from the Nominet Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/what-we-support/projects/wefarm-supporting-smallholders-overseas/ Wefarm - Supporting smallholders overseas]&lt;/ref&gt; This initial prototype of the system was tested in partnership with smallholder farming organisations in [[Peru]], [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]] with successful proof of concept achieved - a real-time, multilingual knowledge sharing by farmers in 3 countries with no access to internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/Nom_CaseStudy_cafe.pdf/ A Nominet Trust Case Study - Wefarm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Wefarm was won the Knight News Challenge, run by the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation|Knight Foundation]], providing support to build a more robust, scalable version of the proof of concept system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knightfoundation.org/grants/20123669/ Knight Foundation Grants]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Wefarm was an overall winner of the Google Impact Challenge, providing funding to launch Wefarm in several different countries around the world and take it to scale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/uk2014/charity/we-farm Google Impact Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018 Wefarm announced it has reached over 1.1 million users across Kenya and Uganda, with plans to expand into the rest of Africa in 2019, beginning with Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-largest-farmer-farmer-network-144800836.html World’s Largest Farmer-to-Farmer Network, Wefarm, Reaches over One Million Users]&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Launch ===

Wefarm launched its newly built v1.0 in Kenya in February 2015, and subsequently in Peru in August 2015.

As of late September 2015 Wefarm had a total number of 18,260 users, with over 1 million SMS messages sent through their platform to date, and more than 45,000 answers to farmers questions shared. Around 60% of farmers who sign-up to Wefarm subsequently actively contribute knowledge to the system.

== Social Goals ==

=== Social goals - users ===

Wefarm users can access vital information that will improve their livelihoods through increasing crop yield, diversifying farming practices, creating micro businesses, and increasing household incomes.

By sharing information users will also build up a bank of agricultural knowledge that can benefit isolated farmers around the developing world.

=== Social goals - commercial partners ===

Food and drink companies, supermarkets, and other businesses with suppliers in Africa and Latin America can improve supply chain transparency and increase supply chain sustainability through partnering with Wefarm.

== Technology ==

Wefarm is an SMS-based peer-to-peer knowledge sharing platform that can be accessed using a basic mobile phone. Users sign up for free sending an SMS to a national short-code number in each country of operation. The user then registers their name, and can ask a question by sending an SMS to the Wefarm number.

Questions are crowdsourced via other farmers in the region and around the world, using a voluntary translation tool.

== Business model ==

In January 2015 Wefarm was launched as a social enterprise subsidiary of CPF, with a for-profit business model in order to achieve long-term financial sustainability and scalability. Wefarm plans to partner with local, national, and international companies who want to increase sustainability and transparency in their supply chains and access isolated farming markets.

'''World Game''', sometimes called the '''World Peace Game''', is an educational simulation developed by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in 1961 to help create solutions to [[overpopulation]] and the uneven distribution of global resources. This alternative to [[Wargaming|war games]] uses Fuller's [[Dymaxion map]] and requires a group of players to cooperatively solve a set of metaphorical scenarios, thus challenging the dominant nation-state perspective with a more holistic "total world" view. The idea was to "make the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological damage or disadvantage to anyone,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Game|url=http://bfi.org/about-bucky/buckys-big-ideas/world-game|publisher=Buckminster Fuller Institute|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus increasing the [[quality of life]] for all people.

==History and use==
Fuller first publicly proposed the concept as the [[core curriculum]] at the (then new) [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]]. He proposed it again in 1964 for the 1967 [[Expo 67|International and Universal Exposition]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada.

In a preamble to World Game documents released in 1970, Fuller identified it very closely with his 'Guinea Pig 'B' experiment' and his 'Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science' lifework. He claimed intellectual property rights as well to control what he considered to be misapplication of his idea by others. He also claimed he had been playing it 'longhand' without the assistance of computers since 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org/about-bucky/buckys-big-ideas/world-game World Game article at the Buckminster Fuller Institute Website]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1972, the World Game Institute was founded in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] by Fuller, [[Medard Gabel]], [[Howard J. Brown (businessman)|Howard J. Brown]] and others.

In 1980, the World Game Institute and the World Resources Inventory published the World Energy Data Sheet.  The World Energy Data Sheet compiled a nation by nation summary of energy production, resources, and consumption. The information was compiled in tables and map formats. The project was researched by Seth Snyder and overseen by Medard Gabel.  The work was used during a World Game (Philadelphia, summer 1980).

By 1993, the World Game Institute developed and sold an educational software package called Global Recall, which contained global data, maps, an encyclopedia of world problems, and tools for developing solutions to world problems.  The package was a computer-based simulation game intended for use by high school and college students in learning about world problems and how to solve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitez|first=Michael|title=Software Provides Opportunity To Think Globally The World Game Institute Has Put Its Ideas On Computer Disk|url=http://articles.philly.com/1993-05-20/news/25966386_1_world-game-global-citizens-software|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=May 20, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a for-profit educational company named o.s. Earth, Inc. purchased the principal assets of the World Game Institute and has been offering a Global Simulation Workshop that is a 'direct descendant of Buckminster Fuller's famous World Game.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osearth.com/ o.s.Earth Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;
