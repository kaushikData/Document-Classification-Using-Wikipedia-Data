The '''Apple Remote''' is a [[remote control]] device released in or after October 2005 by [[Apple Inc.]] for use with a number of its products which use [[infrared]] capabilities. The device was originally designed to interact with the [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]] media program on the iSight [[iMac G5]] and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers. The first three generations of [[Apple TV]] used the Apple Remote as their primary control mechanism. It has now been replaced with the [[Siri Remote]] in the fourth generation. Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple produced several nameless IR remotes for products such as the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebay.ie/itm/VERY-RARE-REMOTE-for-the-Black-Apple-Computer-Macintosh-TV-RMC-A1-1993-/172249717505?hash=item281ae21b01:g:YSQAAOSwuAVWz9sV|title=VERY RARE - REMOTE for the Black Apple Computer Macintosh TV - RMC-A1 1993|website=eBay|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebay.ie/itm/Apple-Macintosh-Performa-TV-Tuner-Board-820-0549-A-Power-Mac-Video-Capture-Card-/251434624277?hash=item3a8aabe515:g:CrYAAOxyOlhS5HuL|title=Apple Macintosh Performa TV Tuner Board 820-0549-A Power Mac Video Capture Card|website=eBay|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebay.ie/itm/VINTAGE-Apple-RK6934-321-PowerCD-CD-Drive-Player-Remote-Control-w-Batteries-/201587742448?hash=item2eef90d6f0:g:7QEAAOSw95lXEXti|title=VINTAGE Apple RK6934/321 PowerCD CD Drive Player Remote Control w/ Batteries|website=eBay|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Apple Remote.jpg|thumb|right|70px|Original Apple Remote]]
The original Apple Remote was designed with six buttons and made of white plastic. Its shape and layout resembled the first-generation [[iPod Shuffle]]. A circular Play/Pause/Select button sat in the center of a larger four-button circle of (clockwise): Volume Up, Next/Fast-forward, Volume Down and Previous/Rewind. A separate Menu button was positioned below. The price was set at US$29.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Apple Computer Universal Dock and Apple Remote |date=October 21, 2005 |url=http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/apple-computer-universal-dock-and-apple-remote-ipod |accessdate=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the remote was redesigned as a thinner and longer aluminum version. The new remote was released along with the 27&amp;nbsp;inch aluminum [[iMacs]] and [[multi-touch]] [[Magic Mouse]]. The Play/Pause button was moved out of the center of the directional buttons and put beside the Menu button (under the directional buttons). The symbols for the Volume Up/Down and Next/Fast-forward buttons were replaced with small dots, to make it clear that the buttons were also used to move up, down, left, and right within menus. All of the buttons became black and embossed within aluminum. Along with the new design, the price was dropped to US$19.99. The newer design also underwent a slight revision with the navigation ring. In a small percentage of older remotes, this ring was flush with the curvature of the remote's aluminum body. The more-common revision is bulged slightly; presumably so users can find the ring more easily by touch.

Replacement of the [[CR2032 battery]] in the original remote is done with a small pointed object such as a [[paper clip]] at the bottom right edge of the device, where the battery slides out on a tray. The newer version has the battery located behind a compartment in the middle of the device which is accessed by turning a coin in the compartment door's indent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=How to replace the Apple Remote battery |date=June 6, 2008 |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1306 |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
The Apple Remote's original function was to enable navigation in [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]], which allows users to browse and play music, view videos ([[DVD]]s and downloaded files) and browse photos. Although Front Row was removed from [[OS X 10.7]] and later, some Apple software still works with the remote. It can still be used to control presentations in [[Apple Keynote]] (on both Intel Macs &amp; [[PowerPC]] Macs), picture slide shows in [[iPhoto]] and [[Aperture]], DVD films via [[DVD Player (software)|DVD Player]], and to play video and audio in [[iTunes]] and [[QuickTime]]. Other software that is still compatible includes [[Elgato]]'s EyeTV 3.5, and [[VLC media player]]. The remote can also be used to run presentations in [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] 2008 or in [[OpenOffice.org Impress]].

Other functions controlled by the remote can include putting a device into [[sleep mode]], selecting a partition to boot from on startup, and ejecting optical disks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Startup Manager: How to select a startup volume|date=March 23, 2009 |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1310 |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A device can be configured to respond only to a particular remote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Pairing your Apple Remote with your computer |date=November 24, 2009 |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1619 |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== iPods ===
An [[iPod]] placed in a [[Apple Dock Connector|dock]] featuring an IR sensor can be used with the remote for music and media control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Pairing the Apple Remote with the iPod Universal Dock |date=May 3, 2010 |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4154 |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remote's menu functionality does not work on the iPod. The Apple Remote can also be used to control the [[iPod Hi-Fi]] or third party devices tailored to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Using the Apple Remote with iPod Hi-Fi |date=April 14, 2008 |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1697 |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boot Camp ===
Starting with [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] 1.2, the remote has had some functionality when a user is running [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. If [[iTunes]] is installed on the Windows partition, pressing the Menu button on the remote will load the program. The remote's media controls also support [[Windows Media Player]], as well as system volume control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boot Camp Installstion &amp; Setup Guide |url=http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/boot_camp_install-setup.pdf |publisher=Apple |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729005350/http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/Boot_Camp_Install-Setup.pdf |archivedate=July 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other third party programs may also utilize the remote's capabilities; media applications such a [[foobar2000]] and [[Media Player Classic]] allow users to control their functions via the remote. Applications must be in focus for the remote to control them. Boot Camp 5, the latest version of the software, also includes drivers for the remote control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boot Camp 5: Frequently asked questions
|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5639|publisher=Apple|accessdate=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== iOS App ==
{{Main|iTunes Remote}}
Apple offers a free '[[iTunes Remote|Remote]]' app for [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] devices (available in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple]] [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]) which allows for wireless control of iTunes on Mac/[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] computers or the Apple TV.

== The Fourth Generation Apple TV and the Siri Remote ==
[[File:Siri Remote and old Apple Remote.JPG|thumb|220x220px|Siri Remote on the Right]]
The [[Siri Remote]] was launched with the 4th Generation Apple TV in 2015. It uses both [[Infrared|IR]] and [[Bluetooth]] to communicate with the Apple TV. The remote has a glass trackpad, dual microphones, 5 buttons for Menu, Home, [[Siri]] and Play/Pause, Volume up and down as 1 button and is the size of 2 buttons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT205305|title=Use your Siri Remote or Apple TV Remote with Apple TV (4th generation)|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally it has an [[accelerometer]] ([[Inertial measurement unit|IMU]]) and a gyroscope&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/tvos/human-interface-guidelines/remote-and-controllers/|title=Siri Remote and Game Controllers - tvOS Human Interface Guidelines
|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows the remote to be used as a gaming controller for [[tvOS]] apps and games. The remote (unlike previous generations) uses a built-in rechargeable [[Lithium polymer battery|Lithium Polymer Battery]] that is charged through the [[Lightning (connector)|lightning port]] at the bottom of the remote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT205384 |title=Charge your Siri Remote or Apple TV Remote |publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Siri Remote is known as the Apple TV Remote in places that don't support Siri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-au/ht205300 |title=Use Siri on your Apple TV (4th generation) |publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier models of the iMac (Polycarbonate iMac) featured a magnetic rest for the remote,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=iMac (Mid 2007): No Remote rest for Apple Remote |date=August 13, 2007 |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TA24898 |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later removed.

=== Use with new MacBook Airs, Retina MacBook Pros and older Macs ===
Using the Apple Remote with new MacBook Airs, Retina MacBooks or old Macs without a built-in IR Receiver requires a USB-based infrared receiver and additional software from a third party.

Using Remote Buddy (from IOSPIRIT GmbH) or mira (from Twisted Melon), it is possible to connect an external USB receiver such as the [[Windows Media Center]] Edition eHome receiver, and use the Apple Remote on these machines with full support for sleep, pairing, low battery detection and controlling a variety of Apple and third party software. In addition, Remote Buddy is able to emulate events of an Apple Remote on these systems, enabling users to use software written for the Apple Remote in exactly the same way as with Macs that have a built-in infrared receiver.

For the Apple computers without built-in infrared receiver, there is a miniature USB receiver, the ''SmartGUS'', which allows to give to iMac, MacBook and Mac Pro, the infrared functionality. In this case, all compatible software (iTunes, Keynote, PowerPoint, OpenOffice Impress, QuickTime Player, iPhoto, VLC, Kodi, Remote Buddy, Mira ...) can use the features of the Apple Remote.

==Infrared interference==
Because many electrical appliances use infrared remote (IR) controls, concurrent use of the Apple Remote with other IR remotes may scramble communications and generate interference, preventing stable use. Remotes should be used individually to circumvent the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Apple TV: IR interference can prevent your remote from working |date=March 22, 2007 |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TA24608 |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical details==
[[File:Apple-Remote-G2-Infrared-LED.jpg|thumb|Apple Remote 2nd generation with lit infrared LED.]]
The Apple Remote uses an [[Consumer IR#Standards|NEC IR protocol]][http://wiki.altium.com/display/ADOH/NEC+Infrared+Transmission+Protocol] which consists of a differential [[pulse-position modulation|PPM]] encoding on a 1:3 [[duty cycle]] 38 [[kHz]] 950 [[nanometre|nm]] [[infrared]] carrier. There are 32 bits of encoded data between the [[automatic gain control|AGC]] leader and the stop bit:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Callendrello |first=Casey |title=Apple Remote library for Arduinio |date=October 11, 2008 |publisher=caseyc.net |url=http://caseyc.net/home/2008/10/11/apple-remote-library-for-arduinio/ |accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

While the Apple Remote uses the NEC IR protocol for the timing, the 32-bit data package is in a different format. It consists of two 16 bit LSB words.

AM worked by generating and modifying short Lisp programs which were then interpreted as defining various mathematical concepts;&lt;ref name="koza"&gt;{{citation|title=Genetic Programming: On the Programming of Computers by Means of Natural Selection|series=|first=John R.|last=Koza|publisher=MIT Press|year=1992|isbn=9780262111706|contribution=9.3 AM and Euroski|pages=232–236|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bhtxo60BV0EC&amp;pg=PA232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, a program that tested equality between the length of two lists was considered to represent the concept of numerical equality, while a program that produced a list whose length was the product of the lengths of two other lists was interpreted as representing the concept of multiplication.  The system had elaborate heuristics for choosing which programs to extend and modify, based on the experiences of working mathematicians in solving mathematical problems.

== Controversy ==

Lenat claimed that the system was composed of hundreds of data structures called "concepts," together with hundreds of "heuristic rules" and a simple flow of control: "AM repeatedly selects the top task from the agenda and tries to carry it out.  This is the whole control structure!"  Yet the heuristic rules were not always represented as separate data structures; some had to be intertwined with the control flow logic.  Some rules had preconditions that depended on the history, or otherwise could not be represented in the framework of the explicit rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ritchie|Hanna|1984}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;256–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

What's more, the published versions of the rules often involve vague terms that are not defined further, such as "If two expressions are structurally similar, ..." (Rule 218) or "... replace the value obtained by some other (very similar) value..." (Rule 129).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ritchie|Hanna|1984}}, p.&amp;nbsp;258.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source of information is the user, via Rule 2: "If the user has recently referred to X, then boost the priority of any tasks involving X."  Thus, it appears quite possible that much of the real discovery work is buried in unexplained procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ritchie|Hanna|1984}}, p.&amp;nbsp;252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenat claimed that the system had rediscovered both [[Goldbach's conjecture]] and the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].  Later critics accused Lenat of over-interpreting the output of AM. In his paper ''Why AM and Eurisko appear to work'', Lenat conceded that any system that generated enough short Lisp programs would generate ones that could be interpreted by an external observer as representing equally sophisticated mathematical concepts.  However, he argued that this property was in itself interesting&amp;mdash;and that a promising direction for further research would be to look for other languages in which short random strings were likely to be useful.&lt;ref&gt;Lenat, D. B., and Brown, J. S. (August 1984). "Why AM and EURISKO appear to work." ''Artificial Intelligence'' 23(3):269—294.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Successor ==

This intuition was the basis of AM's successor [[Eurisko]], which attempted to generalize the search for mathematical concepts to the search for useful [[heuristic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Artificial Intelligence: Mirrors for the Mind|series=Milestones in Discovery and Invention|first=Harry|last=Henderson|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2007|isbn=9781604130591|contribution=The Automated Mathematician|pages=93–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vKmIiICDIwgC&amp;pg=PA93}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chafing dish''' (from the French ''chauffer'', "to make warm") is a kind of portable grate raised on a tripod, originally heated with [[charcoal]] in a [[brazier]], and used for foods that require gentle cooking, away from the "fierce" heat of direct flames. The chafing dish could be used at table or provided with a cover for keeping food warm on a [[buffet]]. Double dishes that provide a protective water jacket are known as ''[[bain-marie|bains-marie]]'' and help keep delicate foods, such as fish, warm while preventing overcooking.

== History ==

The Roman politician and writer [[Cicero]] described a "kind of saucepan of Corinthian brass", writing "This simple and ingenious vessel possesses a double bottom, the upper one holds the light delicacies . . . and the fire is lit underneath".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America|last1=Lovegren|first1=Sylvia|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|year=2013|isbn=9780199734962|location=|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fragments of ceramic chafing dishes are common in the archaeology of medieval city sites, such as [[York]], England.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Dean, ''Medieval York'' 2008:140.&lt;/ref&gt; Chafing dishes in the form of charcoal-burning braziers are familiar in 17th-century American inventories almost from the start. [[François Pierre La Varenne]], ''Le Cuisinier françois'' (Paris, 1652) mentions the use of a ''réchaut'' in a recipe for ''champignons à l'olivier''.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Frank Schloesser, ''The Cult of the Chafing Dish'' 1905:3.&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the Velasquez [[genre]] painting (''illustration''), sometimes art historians not handy in the kitchen describe her as ''frying'' eggs in her earthenware dish.&lt;ref&gt;John Mortimer, "Fried eggs to savor" in ''Smithsonian Magazine'' May 2005 p 124.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1520, [[Hernan Cortez]] reported to [[Charles I of Spain|Charles V]] the manner in which [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]] was served meals in [[Tenochtitlan]]:
:''"He was served in the following manner: Every day as soon as it was light, six hundred nobles and men of rank were in attendance at the palace, who either sat, or walked about the halls and galleries, and passed their time in conversation, but without entering the apartment where his person was. The servants and attendants of these nobles remained in the court-yards, of which there were two or three of great extent, and in the adjoining street, which was also very spacious. They all remained in attendance from morning until night; and when his meals were served, the nobles were likewise served with equal profusion, and their servants and secretaries also had their allowance. Daily his larder and wine-cellar were open to all who wished to eat or drink. The meals were served by three or four hundred youths, who brought on an infinite variety of dishes; indeed, whenever he dined or supped, the table was loaded with every kind of flesh, fish, fruits, and vegetables that the country produced. As the climate is cold, they put a chafing-dish with live coals under every plate and dish, to keep them warm..."

In England silver braziers without handles, upon which a dish would be set, are mentioned in the reign of Queen Anne; wooden balls kept the heat of the charcoal in the pierced container from being transferred to the table surface.&lt;ref&gt;As on a Boston example by [[John Coney (silversmith)|John Coney]] (died 1722) at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], (acc. no. 41.70.4) illustrated and described in Marshall Davidson, "A Selection of Early New England Silver" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin,'' '''36'''.11 (November 1941:233–235) fig. 1, &lt;/ref&gt; Dish-crosses and the chafing dish with a handle were introductions of the reign of George II.&lt;ref&gt;Hollis French, "An Eighteenth Century American Brazier", ''The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art'', 1918, describes an illustrates an American silver chafing dish by John Potwine.&lt;/ref&gt; In the American colonies, "One chafing dish" was inventoried among the silver at [[Abraham de Peyster]]'s death in New York, 1728, though only two colonial New York examples are known to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Downs, "New York Silver" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'' '''30'''.6 (June 1935:130–131), one illustrated fig. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In a light form and heated over a spirit lamp, a chafing dish could also be  used for cooking various dainty dishes at table&amp;mdash; of fish, cream, eggs or cheese&amp;mdash; for which silver chafing dishes with fine heat-insulating wooden handles were made in the late 19th century, when "chafing-dish suppers" became fashionable, even in households where a kitchen maid prepared all the ingredients beforehand. Specialized chafing-dish cookbooks appeared from the 1880s. A book of chafing-dish recipes printed for the silversmiths, [[Gorham Manufacturing Company|Gorham Manufacturing Co.]] in New York, (2nd edition, 1894), featured a brief history of chafing dishes, followed by proper instruction for use, suggesting its novelty. [[Fannie Farmer]]'s ''Chafing Dish Possibilities'' was published in Boston in 1898.
 
Modern chafing dishes are made of light metal or ceramic casseroles with handles, sometimes covered with a [[Pyrex]] lid. Classic uses of a chafing-dish are in preparing [[Welsh rarebit]] or [[cheese fondue]].

[[Image:AnitaPrototype1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Prototype of the first all-electronic desktop calculator marketed by {{nowrap|Sumlock Comptometer Ltd}} of the [[UK]]&lt;/div&gt;]]

The '''comptometer''' was the first commercially successful key-driven [[mechanical calculator]], patented in the United States by [[Dorr E. Felt]] in 1887.

A key-driven calculator is extremely fast because each key adds or subtracts its value to the accumulator as soon as it is pressed and a skilled operator can enter all of the digits of a number simultaneously, using as many fingers as required, making them sometimes faster to use than [[electronic calculator]]s. Consequently, in specialized applications, comptometers remained in use in limited numbers into the early 1990s, but with the exception of museum pieces, they have all now been superseded by electronic calculators and [[computer]]s.

Manufactured without interruption from 1887 to the mid-1970s, it was constantly improved. The mechanical versions were made faster and more reliable, then a line of electro-mechanical models was added in the 1930s. Notably, it was the first mechanical calculator to receive an all-electronic calculator engine in 1961, with the [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA Mark VII]] model released by Sumlock Comptometer. This created the link between the mechanical calculator industries and the electronic.

Although the comptometer was primarily an [[adding machine]], it could also do subtractions, multiplication and division. Its keyboard consisted of eight or more columns of nine keys each. Special comptometers with varying key arrays were produced for a variety of special purposes, including calculating [[currency exchanges]], times and [[Imperial weight]]s. The name comptometer was formerly in wide use as a generic name for this class of calculating machine.

==History==
[[Image:EarlyComptometerMachine.png|thumb|left|&lt;div align="center"&gt;An early machine (1887)&lt;/div&gt;]]

===Origins===
[[Image:Macaronibox.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;div align="center"&gt;The macaroni box (1885)&lt;/div&gt;]]
The comptometer is the direct descendant of the key-driven machine of Thomas Hill &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=nWRYAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=hill+arithmometer Hill's Arithmometer patent]&lt;/ref&gt; patented in the United States in 1857 and of the [[Pascaline]] invented by [[Blaise Pascal]] in France in 1642. By just replacing the input wheels of the Pascaline by the columns of keys of Hill's machine, the comptometer was invented. Addition is performed exactly the same way, and both the Pascaline and the Comptometer make use of the [[Method of complements|9's complement]] method for subtraction, but in the case of the comptometer it is the operator who must choose the right keys for the [[subtrahend]] (each key has its 9's complement written in miniature letter next to it).

===The first comptometers===
[[Dorr Felt]] began his work on comptometer in 1882&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cutter|first1=William Richard|title=American Biography: A New Cyclopedia|date=1931|publisher=Pub. under the direction of the American historical society|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35cMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Comptometer+1882&amp;dq=Comptometer+1882&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIuqjgu4nWAhXkE5oKHYIJAowQ6AEIKDAA|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and started building first prototype during the American [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] holidays of 1884. Because of his limited amount of money, he used a macaroni box for the outside box, and skewers, staples and rubber bands for the mechanism inside. It was finished soon after [[New Year's Day]], 1885. This prototype, called the macaroni box,&lt;ref&gt;(fr) Jean Marguin, ''Histoire des instruments et machines à calculer'', page 125, Hermann, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; is in the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States.

Shortly after, Robert Tarrant, the owner of a [[Chicago]] workshop, gave Mr. Felt a salary of $6 a week, a bench to work on and what would add up to $5,000 to build his first practical machine which he finished in the autumn of 1886.

By September 1887, eight production machines had been built.

===Comptometer and comptograph===
[[Image:Mechanical-Calculator.png|thumb|left|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Comptograph (1914)&lt;/div&gt;]]
The original comptometer design was patented by Felt, on July 19, 1887&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=-FxEAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent No. 366,945], filed on July 6, 1886&lt;/ref&gt; and on October 11, 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=TptMAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent No. 371,496], filed on March 12, 1887&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, on June 11, 1889, he was granted a patent for the Comptograph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=wG1XAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent No. 405,024], filed on January 19, 1888&lt;/ref&gt;  A Comptograph is a comptometer with a printing mechanism making it more like a {{nowrap|key-set}} calculating machine (even though the keys are registered as they are typed and not when a handle is pulled) therefore slower and more complicated to operate. It was the first {{nowrap|printing-adding}} machine design to use individualized type impression which made its printed output very legible.

The first comptograph was sold to the Merchants &amp; Manufacturers National Bank of Pittsburgh, PA. in December 1889. It was the first sale of a {{nowrap|recording-adding}} machine ever. This machine is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C..

The Felt &amp; Tarrant Manufacturing Company built both comptometers and comptographs throughout the 1890s. In 1902, the Comptograph Company was set up to manufacture comptographs exclusively, but was shut down at the beginning of [[World War I]].

Forty years later, in the mid-1950s, the Comptometer Corporation reused the name Comptograph for a line of 10 key printing machines.

===Competition===
The comptometer was the first machine in production to challenge the supremacy of the [[arithmometer]] and its clones; but not immediately, it took almost three years to sell the first hundred machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Felt|first=Dorr E.|title=Mechanical arithmetic, or The history of the counting machine|publisher=Washington Institute|location=Chicago|page=4|year=1916|url=https://archive.org/details/mechanicalarithm00feltrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Companies and trademarks==
[[Image:Animation of Comptometer Pins.gif|thumb|right|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Comptometer Pins&lt;/div&gt;]]

===Felt &amp; Tarrant Manufacturing Company===
Felt and Tarrant signed a partnership contract on November 28, 1887. The partnership was incorporated as Felt &amp; Tarrant Manufacturing Company on January 25, 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Turck J.A.V., ''Origin of Modern Calculating Machines'', page 75, Arno Press, 1972, reprint of 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comptograph Company===
In 1902, Felt and Tarrant parted ways in creating a second company and decided to split the shares of both companies so that one would own the controlling interest of a company with 51% of the shares and the other would still share the profits with the remaining 49% of the shares. Mr. Felt became the majority owner of the Felt &amp; Tarrant Manufacturing Company and Mr. Tarrant became the majority owner of the Comptograph Company.&lt;ref&gt;Darby E.,''It all adds up'', page 120, Victor Comptometer Corporation,1968&lt;/ref&gt;  The Felt &amp; Tarrant Manufacturing Company reabsorbed the Comptograph company at the beginning of World War I

===Comptometer Corporation===
The Felt &amp; Tarrant Mfg Co became public in 1947 and changed its name to the Comptometer Corporation in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Darby E.,''It all adds up'', page 112, Victor Comptometer Corporation,1968&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bell Punch Company – Sumlock Comptometer Ltd===
In 1960,&lt;ref&gt;Darby E., ''It all adds up'', page 125, Victor Comptometer Corporation, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bell Punch|Bell Punch Company]] bought the British rights to the Comptometer design and trademark, and continued its development. In 1961, Sumlock, a division of the Bell Punch Company, was renamed The Sumlock Comptometer Ltd, and began marketing the first all-electronic desktop calculator, the ANITA Mark VII. The entire calculator division of the Bell Punch Company was bought by [[Rockwell International]] in 1973. They exited the calculator business in 1976 and shut down all operations.

===Victor Comptometer Corporation===
In 1961, the Comptometer Corporation merged with the Victor Adding Machine Company, and the two became the Victor Comptometer Corporation. After barely surviving the microprocessor revolution, it is still doing business today as [[Victor Technology]] LLC.

==Evolution==
[[Image:EarlyComptometerKeyboard.png|thumb|left|top|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Keyboard of a woody (1895)&lt;/div&gt;]]

===Wooden boxes===
The first machines were built using wooden boxes, which made them lighter but more fragile. They were called the "woodies", and about {{formatnum:6500}} machines were built in between 1887 and 1903.

Two major improvements happened during the first years of production: the first was the insertion of carry inhibit push buttons for quicker operations of subtraction and the second was the color grouping of the columns of keys (three by three except for the first two columns that represent hundredths). Mr. Felt continually improved his machine with seven patents filed during the first ten years. These included the patents that he took for the Comptograph.

Each row of keys is differentiated from the one above and the one below by a different tactile feel: the even rows have round and raised keys and the odd rows have flat and oblong keys. The keys of the first machines, with their metal rims, are similar to the typewriters keys of the same period. Plastic keys were also introduced very early on but their rows do not have that tactile difference.

The woodies had a three-part zeroing mechanism: a lever, a lever stop, and a knob. In order to reset the machine, first push the lever toward the stop, start rotating the knob and release the lever as soon as the result numbers start to move. Continue rotating the knob until all the result numbers are reset.

[[Image:Comptometer Model A.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Model A (1905)&lt;/div&gt;]]

===Model A===
All the models, from this one on, have a metal casing, but the model A has a polished glass panel for the output display in the front. This model is produced from 1904 to 1906.

Described in patents 762,520 and 762,521, it introduces a new carry mechanism that reduces the power needed to operate the keys to one fourth of its predecessor's. It also introduces the duplex feature that allows for keys to be pressed simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Turck J.A.V., ''Origin of Modern Calculating Machines'', page 149-157, Arno Press, 1972, reprint of 1921&lt;/ref&gt; And finally it introduces a simplified clearing mechanism that only requires one lever, and one back and forth motion of it, to reset the machine. "The machine gun of the office" as it was called in some World War I advertisements,&lt;ref&gt;''The Soldiers' French Phrase Book'', The Felt &amp; Tarrant Mfg Co, advertisement page 54, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; was starting to develop the form and mechanism that it would keep for the next forty years.

===Model B,C,D===
These models are built from 1907 to 1915. They all have the shoebox metal casing that will be used until the end of [[World War II]].

===Model E===
[[Image:Comptometer model E.png|thumb|right|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Model E "Controlled-Key" Compotometer with a white release key (1914)&lt;/div&gt;]]

Very few machines of this type were built, but all were made between 1913 and 1915. This was a transition machine that introduced the "Controlled-Key" safeguard, which was part of an error detection mechanism that blocked most of the keyboard if a key was not pressed enough to add its total to the result. When this mechanism was activated, all the columns of keys were blocked except for the one where the error occurred. Therefore, the operator could find the column in question, reenter the number and unlock the keyboard by pressing the release key in order to resume the operations.

Each key was supported by a metal plate that wrapped around it on three sides. This created a support that was used to block the key when the error detection mechanism was activated. The blocking mechanism was moved inside the box in the following models.

===Model F===
The production of this model started in 1915 and lasted five years. The error detection mechanism is moved inside the box and the release key is red. This machine is the last machine without the Comptometer logo inscribed on its front and back panels.

[[Image:Comptometer.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Model J (1930s)&lt;/div&gt;]]

===Model H, J, ST===
Manufactured from 1920 until the beginning of World War II, these models incorporate all of the improvements of the previous machines. The Comptometer logo is inscribed on their front and back panels and they have the red release key that was introduced with the previous two models.

The ST (SuperTotalizer) has two display output registers and two additional levers that allow for the creation of intermediate results. Each key pressed by the operator is added to the top display register creating an intermediate result which is added to the bottom display register when the operator activates the front right lever (it also resets it). The bottom display register accumulates the intermediate results until it is cleared by using the left lever.

These three models are the last of the shoebox design that was introduced in 1907 with the {{nowrap|B model}}.

===Model K===
This electric model was introduced in the middle of the 1930s and had a very moderate success since the mechanical models were very easy to operate and less expensive to maintain.

[[Image:Comptometer Model WM.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Model WM produced during {{nowrap|WW II}}&lt;/div&gt;]]

===Model M, WM===
Introduced just before World War II, it had a new box design which was more symmetrical and rounder in shape. The WM was manufactured during World War II with a less wasteful use of material for the mechanism.

The WM had many aluminum parts which were more prone to failure so the use of steel was 
resumed as soon as steel again became available. While the machine was lighter, it was also weaker.

[[Image:AnitaMk8-01.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;div align="center"&gt;The ANITA mark VIII sold from 1962 in Britain&lt;/div&gt;]]

===Post World War II models===
The models become lighter with the use of aluminum and more refined inner mechanical designs. Both mechanical and electric models are offered. Their outside is similar to the model M machines. The model 3D11 succeeds to the model M and the electric model 992 succeeds to the model K.
The major external appearance change of the 3D11 &amp; 992, the keys were two tones of green with a fuller depth almost twice the old original style. making identification very easy. Also the lock
release key (red) was moved from the upper right corner of the keyboard to the center and just below the 'one' keys so it could be thumb operated. On model K electrics the motor was turned on with a switch and ran continuously during use. The 992 had a micro switch which started the motor at the start of any key depression and shut off after key action competed. This reduced the motor
wear to almost nil.

The most important new designs of this period came from the Sumlock comptometer Ltd company that introduced the first all-electronic desktop calculators almost two years before the competition. They were the [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA Mark VII]], first introduced in 1961 and marketed in [[Continental Europe]] and the ANITA Mark VIII, a slightly improved design, introduced at the same time, marketed in Britain and the rest of the world. They both started shipping in 1962.

The last ANITA machine with a Comptometer keyboard was the ''ANITA mk 10'' introduced in 1965, still using cold-cathode switching tubes and that will be replaced in 1968 by the ''ANITA mk 11'', a 10 key machine.

Incidentally, [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]'s first all transistor desktop calculator, the ''CS-10A COMPET'', introduced in the summer of 1964, also had a Comptometer type keyboard.

[[File:Plasticity.jpg|thumb|Nonlinear static analysis of a 3D structure subjected to plastic deformations]]

'''Computer-aided engineering''' ('''CAE''') is the broad usage of [[computer software]] to aid in [[engineering]] analysis tasks.  It includes {{nowrap|[[finite element analysis]] (FEA)}}, {{nowrap|[[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD)}}, {{nowrap|[[multibody dynamics]] (MBD)}}, [[durability]] and [[optimization]].

== Overview ==
Computer Softwares used to analyse CAD geometry tools that have been developed to support these activities are considered CAE tools. CAE tools are being used, for example, to analyse the robustness and performance of components and assemblies. The term encompasses simulation, [[verification and validation|validation]], and [[Process optimisation|optimisation]] of products and manufacturing tools. In the future, CAE systems will be major providers of information to help support design teams in decision making.  Computer-aided engineering is used in many fields such as automotive, aviation, space, and shipbuilding industries.&lt;ref name=saracoglu /&gt;

In regard to [[information network]]s, CAE systems are individually considered a single [[node (networking)|node]] on a total information network and each node may interact with other nodes on the network.

CAE systems can provide support to businesses. This is achieved by the use of reference architectures and their ability to place information views on the business process. Reference architecture is the basis from which information model, especially product and manufacturing models.

The term CAE has also been used by some in the past to describe the use of computer technology within engineering in a broader sense than just engineering analysis. It was in this context that the term was coined by  '''Jason Lemon''', founder of [[SDRC]] in the late 1970s. This definition is however better known today by the terms [[CAx]] and [[Product Lifecycle Management|PLM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marks|first1=Peter|title=2007: In Remembrance of Dr. Jason A. Lemon, CAE pioneer|url=http://gfxspeak.com/2011/07/08/in-remembrance-of-dr-jason-a-lemon-cae-pioneer/|website=gfxspeak.com|accessdate=2 Jul 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CAE fields and phases ==
CAE areas covered include:
*[[Stress analysis]] on components and assemblies using [[Finite Element Analysis]] (FEA);
*Thermal and fluid flow analysis [[Computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD);
*[[Multibody dynamics]] (MBD) and [[Kinematics]];
*Analysis tools for process simulation for operations such as [[casting]], [[molding (process)|molding]], and die press forming.
*[[Multidisciplinary design optimization|Optimization]] of the product or process.

In general, there are three phases in any computer-aided engineering task:
*Pre-processing &amp;ndash; defining the model and environmental factors to be applied to it. (typically a finite element model, but facet, [[voxel]] and thin sheet methods are also used)
*Analysis solver (usually performed on high powered computers)
*Post-processing of results (using visualization tools)

This cycle is iterated, often many times, either manually or with the use of [[Multidisciplinary design optimization#Commercial MDO Tools|commercial optimization software]].

==CAE in the automotive industry==
CAE tools are very widely used in the [[automotive industry]]. In fact, their use has enabled the automakers to reduce product development cost and time while improving the safety, comfort, and durability of the vehicles they produce. The predictive capability of CAE tools has progressed to the point where much of the design verification is now done using computer simulations (diagnosis) rather than physical [[prototype]] testing. CAE dependability is based upon all proper assumptions as inputs and must identify critical inputs (BJ). Even though there have been many advances in CAE, and it is widely used in the engineering field, physical testing is still a must. It is used for verification and [[Finite element updating|model updating]], to accurately define loads and boundary conditions and for final prototype sign-off.

==The future of CAE in the product development process==
Even though CAE has built a strong reputation as a verification, troubleshooting and analysis tool, there is still a perception that sufficiently accurate results come rather late in the [[design cycle]] to really drive the design. This can be expected to become a problem as modern products become ever more complex. They include [[smart system]]s, which leads to an increased need for multi-physics analysis including [[Control System|controls]], and contain new lightweight materials, to which engineers are often less familiar. CAE software companies and manufacturers are constantly looking for tools and process improvements to change this situation. On the software side, they are constantly looking to develop more powerful solvers, better use computer resources and include engineering knowledge in pre- and post-processing. On the process side, they try to achieve a better alignment between 3D CAE, 1D System Simulation and physical testing. This should increase modeling realism and calculation speed. On top of that, they try to better integrate CAE in the overall [[Product lifecycle|product lifecycle management]]. In this way, they can connect product design with product use, which is an absolute must for smart products. Such an enhanced engineering process is also referred to as [[predictive engineering analytics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van der Auweraer|first1=Herman|last2=Anthonis|first2=Jan|last3=De Bruyne|first3=Stijn|last4=Leuridan|first4=Jan|title=Virtual engineering at work: the challenges for designing mechatronic products|journal=Engineering with computers|date=2012|volume=29|issue=3|pages=389–408|doi=10.1007/s00366-012-0286-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seong Wook Cho|last2=Seung Wook Kim|last3=Jin-Pyo Park|last4=Sang Wook Yang|last5=Young Choi|title=Engineering collaboration framework with CAE analysis data|journal=International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing|date=2011|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9270">The '''Council for Responsible Genetics''' (CRG) is a [[nonprofit]] [[NGO]] with a focus on [[biotechnology]].

== History ==

The Council for Responsible Genetics was founded in 1983 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

An early voice concerned about the social and ethical implications of &lt;!-- Would it be OR to say "favoring limiting", given that there's never been any evidence (as far as I'm aware) of their favoring (the use of) modern genetic technologies? --&gt; modern genetic technologies, CRG organized a 1985 Congressional Briefing and a 1986 panel of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], both focusing on the potential dangers of genetically engineered biological weapons.&lt;ref name="CRG website"&gt;{{cite web | title = Council for Responsible Genetics | url = http://www.councilforresponsiblegenetics.org/ | accessdate = 2009-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Boyle]] was asked to draft legislation setting limits on the use of genetic engineering, leading to the [[Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989]].&lt;ref name="US Bioweapons Break Laws"&gt;{{cite web | title = Broadening Our Perspective | url = http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/AOPof911p06.html | accessdate = 2009-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRG was the first organization to compile documented cases of [[genetic discrimination]], laying the intellectual groundwork for the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] of 2008 (GINA).&lt;ref name="CRG website"/&gt;

The organization created both a Genetic Bill of Rights and a Citizen's Guide to Genetically Modified Food. Also notable are CRG's support for the "Safe Seeds Campaign" (for avoiding [[gene flow]] from [[genetically engineered]] to non-GE seed) and the organization of a US conference on Forensic DNA Databanks and Racial Disparities in the Criminal Justice System.&lt;ref name="CRG website"/&gt; In 2010 CRG led a successful campaign to roll back a controversial student genetic testing program at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-12/uc-berkeley-backs-off-gene-test-program-for-students-blocked-by-state.html/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, CRG led a campaign to successfully enact [CalGINA] in California, which extended [[genetic privacy]] and nondiscrimination protections to life, disability and long term care insurance, mortgages, lending and other areas.

CRG has issued five anthologies of commentaries:
* ''Rights and Liberties in the Biotech Age'' edited by [[Sheldon Krimsky]] and Peter Shorett&lt;ref name="CRG website" /&gt; 
* ''Race and the Genetic Revolution: Science, Myth and Culture''&lt;ref name="CRG website" /&gt; 
* ''Genetic Explanations:  Sense and Nonsense'' edited by Krimsky and [[Jeremy Gruber]]&lt;ref name="CRG website" /&gt; 
* ''Biotechnology in our Lives'' edited by Krimsky and Gruber&lt;ref name="CRG website" /&gt; 
* ''The GMO Deception'' edited by Krimsky and Gruber&lt;ref name="CRG website" /&gt;
* Principles and projects
CRG "fosters public debate about the social, ethical and environmental implications of genetic technologies." They list three central [[principles]]:&lt;ref name="CRG website"/&gt;

*The public must have access to clear and understandable information on technological innovations.
*The public must be able to participate in public and private decision making concerning technological developments and their implementation.
*New technologies must meet social needs. Problems rooted in poverty, racism, and other forms of inequality, according to CRG, cannot be remedied by technology alone.

[[Image:Simple Crane diagram..png|thumb|right|400px|Simple Crane]]

A '''counterweight''' is a weight that, by exerting an opposite force, provides balance and stability of a [[mechanical system]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/counterweight&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to make lifting the load more efficient, which saves [[energy]] and is less taxing on the lifting [[machine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.explainthatstuff.com/how-elevators-work.html How do elevators and lifts work?] at explainthatstuff.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Counterweights are often used in traction [[elevator|lifts]] (elevators), [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s and [[funfair]] rides. In these applications, the expected load multiplied by the distance that load will be spaced from the central support (called the "tipping point") must be equal to the counterweight's mass times its distance from the tipping point in order to prevent over-balancing either side. This distance times mass is called the [[Moment (physics)|load moment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ecrane-usa.com/products/bcdp.html | title=Basic Crane Design principles  | publisher=E-Crane International | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''counterbalance''' is a weight or force that balances or offsets another as when two objects of equal weight, power, or influence are acting in opposition to each other. The objects are then said to be in counterbalance.

==Counterweights in action==
[[Trebuchet]]: There are five major components of a trebuchet: beam, counterweight, frame, guide chute, and sling. After the counterweight drops from a platform on the frame, gravity pulls the counterweight and pivots the beam. Without the counterweight, the beam could not complete the arc that allows the sling to accurately release the projectile.&lt;ref name="redstoneprojects"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=How a Trebuchet Catapult Works|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blelevator.htm|accessdate=2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=How does a catapult work?|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question127.htm|date=2000-04-01|accessdate=2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crankshaft]]: A countehirweight is also used in many rotating systems to reduce vibrations due to imbalances in the rotating assembly. A typical example is counterweights on [[crankshaft]]s in [[piston engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Crankshaft Balancing - Engine Builder Magazine |url=http://www.enginebuildermag.com/2009/05/understanding-crankshaft-balancing/ |website=Engine Builder Magazine |accessdate=28 June 2018 |date=12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desk lamp:''' Some [[balanced arm lamps]] work with a counterweight to keep the arm and lamp in the desired position.

[[Elevator]]: In traction (non-hydraulic) elevators, a heavy counterweight counterbalances the load of the elevator carriage, so the [[electric motor|motor]] lifts much less of the carriage's weight (specifically, the counterweight is the weight of the carriage plus 40-50% of its rated capacity). The counterweight also increases the ascending acceleration force and decreases the descending acceleration force to reduce the amount of power needed by the motor. The elevator carriage and the counterweights both have wheel roller guides attached to them to prevent irregular movement and provide a smoother ride for the passengers.&lt;ref name="Bellis"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bellis, Mary|title=The History of the Elevator|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blelevator.htm|accessdate=2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Space elevator structural diagram--corrected for scale+CM+etc.svg|thumb|220px|alt=Diagram of a space elevator.  At the bottom of the tall diagram is the Earth as viewed from high above the North Pole.  About six earth-radii above the Earth an arc is drawn with the same center as the Earth.  The arc depicts the level of geosynchronous orbit.  About twice as high as the arc and directly above the Earth's center, a counterweight is depicted by a small square.  A line depicting the space elevator's cable connects the counterweight to the equator directly below it.  The system's center of mass is described as above the level of geosynchronous orbit.  The center of mass is shown roughly to be about a quarter of the way up from the geosynchronous arc to the counterweight.  The bottom of the cable is indicated to be anchored at the equator.  A climber is depicted by a small rounded square.  The climber is shown climbing the cable about one third of the way from the ground to the arc. Another note indicates that the cable rotates along with the Earth's daily rotation, and remains vertical. |Space elevator with counterweight at top.]][[Space elevator]]: A [[space elevator]] is a proposed structure designed to transport material from a [[Astronomical object|celestial body]]'s [[Planetary surface|surface]] into space.  Many variants have been proposed, but the concept most often refers to an elevator that reaches from the surface of the [[Earth]] to [[Geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[outer space]], with a counterweight attached at its outer end.

By attaching a counterweight at the end, upward [[centrifugal force]] from the Earth's rotation ensures that the cable remains stretched taut, countering the gravitational pull on the lower sections and thereby allowing the elevator to remain upright.

The counterweight itself could assume one of several forms: 
#a heavy, captured [[asteroid]];
#a [[space dock]], [[space station]] or [[spaceport]] positioned past geostationary orbit; or
#an extension of the cable itself far beyond geostationary orbit.

'''Cranmer Park''' is a [[Denver]] city park&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denvergov.org/parks/FindaPark/tabid/430490/Default.aspx Find a Denver Park] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226172335/http://www.denvergov.org/parks/FindaPark/tabid/430490/Default.aspx |date=December 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; located in the [[Hilltop, Denver|Hilltop]] neighborhood off of Colorado Boulevard between East 1st and East 3rd Avenue. It is most famous for a large [[sundial]], which does double duty as a climbing appliance for children.

An inscription at the base describes the [[Axis of rotation|axis]] of the [[gnomon]] as elevated 39°43' in the direction of [[true north|polar north]]. The stone is [[perpendicular]] to the gnomon at 50°17', which makes it parallel to the [[equator]]. The south side of the stone is similarly marked for wintertime observation.

A polar chart at the base of the sundial describes the [[zodiac]] and degrees of the sun's position, and how to set a clock based on the gnomon's shadow. For winter viewing, the chart continues on the south side of the stone.

==History of the Sundial==
The current sundial is the second one to exist at this location in the park. The first was donated in 1941 by longtime Manager of Denver Parks [[George Cranmer|George E. Cranmer]], for whom the park is named. It was destroyed by vandals who exploded dynamite under it in September 1965. The replacement sundial was installed in March, 1966 after a successful citywide fundraising effort led by the Denver Junior Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!14539!0#focus Art Inventories Catalog, viewed June 20, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''DVD player''' is a device that plays [[DVD]] discs produced under both the [[DVD-Video]] and [[DVD-Audio]] technical standards, two different and incompatible standards. Some DVD players will also play audio CDs. DVD players are connected to a television to watch the DVD content, which could be a movie, a recorded TV show, or other content.

The first DVD player was created by Sony Corporation in Japan in collaboration with Pacific Digital Company from the [[United States]] in 1997.{{fact|date=August 2015}} Some manufacturers originally announced that DVD players would be available as early as the middle of 1996. These predictions were too optimistic. Delivery was initially held up for "political" reasons of copy protection demanded by movie studios, but was later delayed by lack of movie titles. The first players appeared in Japan on November 1, 1996, followed by the United States on March 26, 1997 with distribution limited to only seven major cities for the first six months.

Players slowly trickled into other regions around the world. Prices for the first players in 1997 started at $600 and could top out at prices over $1000. By the end of 2000, players were available for under $100 at discount retailers. In 2003 players became available for under $50. Six years after the initial launch, close to one thousand models of DVD players were available from over a hundred consumer electronics manufacturers.

Fujitsu released the first DVD-ROM-equipped computer on November 6th in GB. Toshiba released a DVD-ROM-equipped computer and a DVD-ROM drive in Japan in early 1997 (moved back from December which was moved back from November). DVD-ROM drives from Toshiba, Pioneer, Panasonic, Hitachi, and Sony began appearing in sample quantities as early as January 1997, but none were available before May. The first PC upgrade kits (a combination of DVD-ROM drive and hardware decoder card) became available from Creative Labs, Hi-Val, and Diamond Multimedia in April and May 1997. In 2014, every major PC manufacturer has models that include DVD-ROM drives.

The first DVD-Audio players were released in Japan by Pioneer in late 1999, but they did not play copy-protected discs. Matsushita (under the Panasonic and Technics labels) first released full-fledged players in July 2000 for $700 to $1,200. DVD-Audio players are now also made by Aiwa, Denon, JVC, Kenwood, Madrigal, Marantz, Nakamichi, Onkyo, Toshiba, Yamaha, and others. Sony released the first SACD players in May 1999 for $5,000. Pioneer's first DVD-Audio players released in late 1999 also played SACD. SACD players are now also made by Accuphase, Aiwa, Denon, Kenwood, Marantz, Philips, Sharp, and others.

== Technical details ==
[[File:DK Digital DVD 1080 open.jpg|thumb|220px|The interior of a DVD player]]

A DVD player has to complete these tasks:
*Read a [[DVD]] disc in ISO – [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] version 1.02 format
*Optionally decrypt the data with either [[Content-scrambling system|CSS]] and/or [[Macrovision]]
*Read and obey the DVD's [[Regional lockout]] codes and display a warning if the player is not authorized to play the DVD
*Decode the [[MPEG-2]] video stream with a maximum of 10 Mbit/s (peak) or 8 Mbit/s (continuous)
*Decode sound in [[MP2 (format)|MP2]], [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] or [[Dolby AC-3|AC-3]] format and output (with optional AC-3 to stereo downmixing) on stereo connector, optical or electric digital connector
*Output a video signal, either an analog one (in [[NTSC]] or [[PAL]]  format) on the [[composite video|composite]], [[S-Video]], [[SCART]], or [[component video]] connectors, or a digital one on the [[Digital visual interface|DVI]] or [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] connectors.
*DVD players cannot play [[Blu-ray ]] discs due to using different wavelength laser's Blu ray use a Blue Violet laser instead of a Red laser. However, all Blu-ray players are "backwards compatible" and they will play DVD's and some are compatible with [[Compact Disc|CD]] and other disc formats.

== CD/DVD/AVI/MP4 playback ==
Additionally, most DVD players allow users to play audio [[compact disc|CD]]s ([[CD-DA]], [[MP3]], etc.) and [[Video CD]]s ([[VCD]]). A few include a [[home cinema]] decoder (i.e. [[Dolby Digital]], [[Digital Theater Systems]] (DTS)). Some newer devices also play videos in the [[Advanced Simple Profile|MPEG-4 ASP]] video compression format (such as [[DivX]]) popular in the Internet.

== Portable players ==
{{See also|Portable DVD player}}
Most hardware DVD players must be connected to a [[television]]; there are portable devices which have an attached [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen and stereo speakers. Portable DVD players are often used for long road trips and travel. They often have a plug for the 12 volt power jack in cars. Some models have two screens, so that two people in the back seat can both watch the movie. Other portable DVD players have a single screen that opens up like a laptop computer screen.

== Output ==
[[File:DVD player output.jpg|thumb|right|Output]]
Due to multiple audio (and video) output devices, there are many outputs on a DVD player, such as an RCA jack, component outputs, and an HDMI output. Consumers may become confused with how to connect a player to a TV or amplifier. Most systems include an optional digital audio connector for this task, which is then paired with a similar input on the amplifier. The physical connection is typically [[RCA connector]]s or [[TOSLINK]], which transmits a [[S/PDIF]] stream carrying either uncompressed digital audio (PCM) or the original compressed audio data (Dolby Digital, DTS, MPEG audio) to be decoded by the audio equipment.

=== Video ===
Video is another issue which continues to present most problems. Current players usually output [[analog signal|analog]] video only, both [[composite video]] on an RCA jack as well as [[S-Video]] in the standard connector. However, neither connector was intended to be used for [[progressive video]], so yet another set of connectors has started to appear, to carry a form of [[component video]], which keeps the three components of the video, one luminance signal and two color difference signal, as stored on the DVD itself, on fully separate wires (whereas S-Video uses two wires, uniting and degrading the two color signals, and composite uses only one, uniting and degrading all three signals). The connectors are further confused by using a number of different physical connectors on different player models, RCA or [[BNC connector|BNC]], as well as using [[VGA connector|VGA]] cables in a non-standard way (VGA is normally analog [[RGB color model|RGB]]&amp;mdash;a different, incompatible form of component video). Even worse, there are often two sets of component outputs, one carrying [[interlaced video]], and the other progressive, or an interlaced/progressive switch (either a physical switch or a menu setting).

In Europe (but not most other PAL areas), [[SCART]] connectors are generally used, which can carry composite and analog RGB interlaced video signals (RGB can be progressive, but not all DVD players and displays support this mode) or Y/C ([[S-Video]]), as well as analog two-channel sound and automatic 4:3 or 16:9 (widescreen) switching on a single convenient multi-wire cable. The analog RGB component signal offers video quality which is superior to S-Video and identical to [[YPbPr]] component video. However, analog RGB and S-Video signals can not be carried simultaneously, due to each using the same pins for different uses, and displays often must be manually configured as to the input signal, since no switching mode exists for S-Video. (A switching mode does exist to indicate whether composite or RGB is being used.) Some DVD players and set-top boxes offer YPbPr component video signals over the wires in the SCART connector intended for RGB, though this violates the official specification and manual configuration is again necessary. (Hypothetically, unlike RGB component, YPbPr component signals and S-Video Y/C signals could both be sent over the wire simultaneously, since they share the luminance (Y) component.)

[[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] is a new digital connection for carrying high-definition video, similar to [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]]. Along with video, HDMI also supports up to eight-channel digital audio. DVD players with connectors for high-definition video can [[Video scaler|upconvert]] the source to formats used for higher definition video (e.g., [[720p]], [[1080i]], [[1080p]], etc.), before outputting the signal. By no means, however, will the resulting signal be high-definition video; that is, aside from optional [[deinterlacing]], upconverting generally consists of merely scaling the video's dimensions to match that of higher resolution formats, foregoing the scaling that would normally occur in the output device.

=== USB ===
Some DVD players include a [[USB video recorder]]. As well as such, there are also have DVD players with a [[USB port]] to be able to play digital media types as well as MP4, MP3, etc.

=== Wireless ===
Wireless connections ([[bluetooth]] and/or [[wifi]]) are useful to manage (play/record)  wirelessly content from or to other devices (i.e. cell phones).

== Prices ==
{{As of|2014}}, retail prices for such a device, depending on its optional features (such as digital sound or video output), start between 30 and 80 [[USD]]/[[Euro]]. They are usually cheaper than [[VCR]]s.

== Manufacture ==
{{As of|2002}} the largest producer of DVD players is [[China]]; in 2002 they produced 30 million players, more than 70% of the world output. These producers have to pay US$15–$20 per player in license fees, to the [[patent]] holders of the DVD technology ([[Sony]], [[Philips]], [[Toshiba]] and [[Time Warner]]) as well as for [[MPEG-2]] licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20020524S0091|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405112139/http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20020524S0091|title=EE Times -Taiwan joins Chinese effort on proprietary DVD format|archivedate=5 April 2004|work=eetimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid these fees, China has developed the [[Enhanced Versatile Disc]] standard as an intended successor of DVD; {{As of|2004|lc=on}}, EVD players were only being sold in China.

== Software ==
'''Software DVD players''' are [[software|program]]s that allow users to view DVD videos on a [[computer]] with a [[DVD|DVD-ROM]] drive. Some examples are the [[VLC media player]], 5KPlayer and [[MPlayer]] (all [[free software]]), as well as [[WinDVD]], [[Arcsoft TotalMedia Theatre|TotalMedia Theatre]], [[PowerDVD]], [[Fluendo DVD Player]] and [[DVD Player (software)|DVD Player]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videohelp.com/tools?listuser=&amp;orderby=Rating&amp;s=11#11|title=Video software and downloads|work=videohelp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among others, there are variants &amp; huge kinds of software DVD players as well as multimedia player software which has DVD video playback capability, whether its proprietary-type(as commercial software), freeware, shareware or just a free software are available in the market.

== Successors ==
There are successors to the DVD player: the [[HD DVD]] player and the [[Blu-ray Disc]] player, utilizing two incompatible technologies that reproduce higher quality video images than standard DVD. On February 19, 2008, Toshiba, creator of the former technology announced it would cease production on all HD DVD products leaving Blu-ray as the high definition successor to DVD players. Also, upscaling and up-converting DVD units are available that connect to televisions via a high definition interface and increase the overall picture quality.

'''Digital Trends''' is a technology news, lifestyle, and information website that publishes news, reviews, guides, how-to articles, descriptive videos and podcasts about technology and [[consumer electronics]] products. With offices in Portland, Oregon, and New York City, Digital Trends is operated by Designtechnica Corp., a media company that also publishes Digital Trends Español, a Spanish-language version of the site, and men's lifestyle site The Manual.

The site offers reviews and information on a wide array of products that have been shaped by technology. That includes consumer electronics products such as [[smartphones]], [[video game]]s and systems, laptops, PCs and peripherals, televisions, home theater systems, digital cameras, video cameras, tablets, and more.

According to third-party [[web analytics]] provider [[SimilarWeb]], the site receives over 40 million visits per month {{As of|2018|June|lc=}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.similarweb.com/website/digitaltrends.com#overview] SimilarWeb. Retrieved 2018-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital Trends editorial team is led by Editor-in-Chief [[Jeremy Kaplan]] and guided by Co-Founders [[Ian Bell (CEO)|Ian Bell]] and Dan Gaul.

== History ==

Ian Bell and Dan Gaul founded Digital Trends in June 2006 in [[Lake Oswego, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=letsgo&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.letsgodigital.org/en/news/articles/story_8145.html | title=Design Technica becomes Digital Trends | first=Nic | last= Rossmüller |
work=LetsGoDigital | date=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Digital Trends moved its headquarters from Lake Oswego into the [[US Bancorp Tower]] in [[Downtown Portland|Downtown Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=siliconflorist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siliconflorist.com/2009/05/01/movin-digital-trends-takes-residence-big-pink/|title=Movin’ on up: Digital Trends takes up residence in Big Pink| first=Rick | last= Turoczy |publisher=Silicon Florist|date=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company opened a second office in [[New York City]] in 2012. Digital Trends is a privately funded and owned corporation. Digital Trends en Español, a Spanish-language version of the site, was launched in December 2014, led by Editor-in-Chief Juan Garcia.

DigitalTrends.com saw a surge in popularity in recent years; the site claimed a 100-percent increase in traffic in September 2015, reaching over 24 million unique readers globally and more than 13 million U.S. readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techinvestornews.com/Gadgets/Latest-Gadget-News/digital-trends-sees-record-traffic-in-september/|title=Digital Trends sees record traffic in September |work=TechInvestorNews|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently reaches approximately 30 million readers per month who view over 100 million pages.

In addition to growth, 2015 saw a series of changes for Digital Trends. The site expanded its awards program to include several international trade shows, including Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and IFA in Berlin. It also launched its first car of the year awards and Smart Home awards, underscoring the site's growing investment in these areas.

'''Doppler echocardiography''' is a procedure that uses [[Doppler ultrasonography]] to examine the [[heart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003869.htm|title=Echocardiogram|website=[[MedlinePlus]]|accessdate=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[echocardiography|echocardiogram]] uses high frequency sound waves to create an image of the heart while the use of Doppler technology allows determination of the speed and direction of [[blood flow]] by utilizing the [[Doppler effect]].

An echocardiogram can, within certain limits, produce accurate assessment of the direction of blood flow and the [[velocity]] of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect. One of the limitations is that the ultrasound beam should be as parallel to the blood flow as possible. Velocity measurements allow assessment of [[cardiac valve]] areas and function, any abnormal communications between the left and right side of the heart, any leaking of blood through the valves ([[valvular regurgitation]]), calculation of the [[cardiac output]] and calculation of [[E/A ratio]]&lt;ref name=Mohamed&gt;[http://www.bioline.org.br/request?mj04008] Abdul Latif Mohamed, Jun Yong, Jamil Masiyati, Lee Lim, Sze Chec Tee. ''The Prevalence Of Diastolic Dysfunction In Patients With Hypertension Referred For Echocardiographic Assessment of Left Ventricular Function.'' Malaysian Journal of Medical Sciences, Vol. 11, No. 1, January  2004, pp. 66-74&lt;/ref&gt; (a measure of [[diastolic dysfunction]]). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound-using gas-filled microbubble contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related medical measurements.

An advantage of Doppler echocardiography is that it can be used to measure blood flow within the heart without [[invasive (medical)|invasive]] procedures such as [[cardiac catheterization]]. 

In addition, with slightly different filter/gain settings, the method can measure tissue velocities by [[tissue Doppler echocardiography]]. The combination of flow and tissue velocities can be used for estimating left ventricular filling [[pressure]], although only under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ommen|first=S. R.|title=Clinical Utility of Doppler Echocardiography and Tissue Doppler Imaging in the Estimation of Left Ventricular Filling Pressures : A Comparative Simultaneous Doppler-Catheterization Study|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/102/15/1788.short|work=Circulation|publisher=Circulation|accessdate=12 July 2012|author2=Nishimura, R.

Although "Doppler" has become synonymous with "velocity measurement" in medical imaging, in many cases it is not the frequency shift (Doppler shift) of the received signal that is measured, but the phase shift (when the received signal arrives). However, the calculation result will end up identical.

This procedure is frequently used to examine children's hearts for [[heart disease]] because there is no age or size requirement.

== 2D Doppler imaging ==

Unlike 1D Doppler imaging, which can only provide one-dimensional velocity and has dependency on the beam to flow angle,&lt;ref name="JAJ"&gt;J. A. Jensen, Estimation of Blood Velocities Using Ultrasound, A Signal Processing Approach, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 2D velocity estimation using Doppler ultrasound is able to generate velocity vectors with axial and lateral velocity components. 2D velocity is useful even if complex flow conditions such as stenosis and bifurcation exist. There are two major methods of 2D velocity estimation using ultrasound: Speckle tracking and crossed beam Vector Doppler, which are based on measuring the time shifts and phase shifts respectively.&lt;ref name="PSA"&gt;P. S. a. L. L. Abigail Swillens, "Two-Dimensional Blood Velocity Estimation With Ultrasound: Speckle Tracking Versus Crossed-Beam Vector Doppler Based on Flow Simulations in a Carotid Bifurcation Model," IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control, pp. 327-338, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vector Doppler ===

Vector Doppler is a natural extension of the traditional 1D Doppler imaging based on phase shift. The phase shift is found by taking the autocorrelation between echoes from two consecutive firings.&lt;ref name="RSC"&gt;R. S. C. Cobbold, Foundations of Biomedical Ultrasound, Oxford University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The main idea of Vector Doppler is to divide the transducer into three apertures: one at the center as the transmit aperture and two on each side as the receive apertures. The phase shifts measured from left and right apertures are combined to give the axial and lateral velocity components. The positions and the relative angles between apertures need to be tuned according to the depth of the vessel and the lateral position of the region of interest.&lt;ref name="PSA" /&gt;

=== Speckle tracking ===

Speckle tracking, which is a well-established method in video compression and other applications, can be used to estimate blood flow in ultrasound systems. The basic idea of speckle tracking is to find the best match of a certain speckle from one frame within a search region in subsequent frames.&lt;ref name="PSA" /&gt; The decorrelation between frames is one of the major factors degrading its performance. The decorrelation is mainly caused by the different velocity of pixels within a speckle, as they do not move as a block. This is less severe when measuring the flow at the center, where the changing rate of the velocity is the lowest. The flow at the center usually has the largest velocity magnitude, called "peak velocity". It is the most needed information in some cases, such as diagnosing stenosis.&lt;ref name="GRM"&gt;G. Reutern, M. Goertler, N. Bornstein, M. Sette, D. Evans, A. Hetzel, M. Kaps, F. Perren, A. Razumovky, T. Shiogai, E. Titianova, P. Traubner, N. Venketasubramanian, L. Wong and M. Yasaka, "Grading Carotid Stenosis Using Ultrasonic Methods," Stroke, Journal of the American Heart Association, vol. 43, pp. 916-921, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are mainly three methods of finding the best match: SAD (Sum of absolute difference), SSD (Sum of squared difference) and Cross correlation. Assume &lt;math&gt;X_0 (i,j)&lt;/math&gt; is a pixel in the kernel and &lt;math&gt;X_1 (i+\alpha,j+\beta)&lt;/math&gt; is the mapped pixel shifted by &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; in the search region.&lt;ref name="JLE"&gt;J. Luo and E. E. Konofagou, "A Fast Motion and Strain Estimation," in Ultrasound Symposium, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

SAD is calculated as:
&lt;math&gt;D(\alpha,\beta)=\sum_{i=1} \sum_{j=1} |X_0 (i,j)-X_1 (i+\alpha,j+\beta)|&lt;/math&gt;

SSD is calculated as:
&lt;math&gt;D(\alpha,\beta)=\sum_{i=1} \sum_{j=1} (X_0 (i,j)-X_1 (i+\alpha,j+\beta))^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Normalized cross correlation coefficient is calculated as:
&lt;math&gt;\rho(\alpha,\beta)=\frac{\sum_{i=1} \sum_{j=1}(X_0 (i,j)-\bar{X_0})(X_1 (i+\alpha,j+\beta)-\bar{X_1})}{\sqrt{(\sum_{i=1} \sum_{j=1} (X_0 (i,j)-\bar{X_0})^{2})(\sum_{i=1} \sum_{j=1} (X_1 (i+\alpha,j+\beta)-\bar{X_1})^{2})}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{X_0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{X_1}&lt;/math&gt; are the average values of &lt;math&gt;X_0 (i,j)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_1 (i,j)&lt;/math&gt; respectively.
The &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; pair that gives the lowest D for SAD and SSD, or the largest ρ for the cross correlation, is selected as the estimation of the movement. The velocity is then calculated as the movement divided by the time difference between the frames. Usually the median or average of multiple estimations is taken to give more accurate result.&lt;ref name="JLE" /&gt;

==== Sub pixel accuracy ====

In ultrasound systems, lateral resolution is usually much lower than the axial resolution. The poor lateral resolution in the [[Medical ultrasonography#Modes of sonography|B-mode]] image also results in poor lateral resolution in flow estimation. Therefore, sub pixel resolution is needed to improve the accuracy of the estimation in the lateral dimension. In the meantime, we could reduce the sampling frequency along the axial dimension to save computations and memories if the sub pixel movement is estimated accurately enough. There are generally two kinds of methods to obtain the sub pixel accuracy: interpolation methods, such as parabolic fit, and phase based methods in which the peak lag is found when the phase of the analytic cross correlation function crosses zero.&lt;ref name="XCM"&gt;X. Chen, M. J. Zohdy, S. Y. Emelianov and M. O'Donnell, "Lateral Speckle Tracking Using Synthetic Lateral Phase," IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrcs and Frequency Control, vol. 51, no. 5, pp. 540-550, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Interpolation method (parabolic fit) =====

[[Image:Interpolation to find peak.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Interpolation to find peak]]

As shown in the right figure, parabolic fit can help find the real peak of the cross correlation function. The equation for parabolic fit in 1D is:&lt;ref name="JAJ"/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;k_{int}=k_s-\frac{(R_{12} (k_s+1)-R_{12} (k_s-1))}{2(R_{12} (k_s+1)-2R_{12} (k_s )+R_{12} (k_s-1))} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is the cross correlation function and &lt;math&gt;k_s&lt;/math&gt; is the originally found peak. &lt;math&gt;k_{int}&lt;/math&gt; is then used to find the displacement of scatterers after  interpolation. For the 2D scenario, this is done in both the axial and lateral dimensions. Some other techniques can be used to improve the accuracy and robustness of the interpolation method, including parabolic fit with bias compensation and matched filter interpolation.&lt;ref name="XLH"&gt;X. Lai and H. Torp, "Interpolation Methods for Time-Delay Estimation Using Cross-Correlation Method for Blood Velocity Measurement," IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrcs and Frequency Control, vol. 46, no. 2, pp. 277-290, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Phase based method =====

The main idea of this method is to generate synthetic lateral phase and use it to find the phase that crosses zero at the peak lag.&lt;ref name="XCM" /&gt;
 
[[Image:Lateral phase cross correlation.vsd.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Lateral phase generation]]

The right figure illustrates the procedure of creating the synthetic lateral phase, as a first step. Basically, the lateral spectrum is split in two to generate two spectra with nonzero center frequencies. The cross correlation is done for both the up signal and down signal, creating &lt;math&gt;R_{up}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{down}&lt;/math&gt; respectively.&lt;ref name="XCM" /&gt; The lateral correlation function and axial correlation function are then calculated as follows:
&lt;math&gt;R_{lateral}=R_{up}*R_{down}^{*}; R_{axial}=R_{up}*R_{down}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_{down}^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of &lt;math&gt;R_{down}&lt;/math&gt;.

They have the same magnitude, and the integer peak is found using traditional cross correlation methods. After the integer peak is located, a 3 by 3 region surrounding the peak is then extracted with its phase information. For both the lateral and axial dimensions, the zero crossings of a one-dimensional correlation function at the other dimension’s lags are found, and a linear least squares fitted line is created accordingly. The intersection of the two lines gives the estimate of the 2D displacement.&lt;ref name="XCM" /&gt;

=== Comparison between vector Doppler and speckle tracking ===

Both methods could be used for 2D Velocity Vector Imaging, but Speckle Tracking would be easier to extend to 3D. Also, in Vector Doppler, the depth and resolution of the region of interest are limited by the aperture size and the maximum angle between the transmit and receive apertures, while Speckle Tracking has the flexibility of alternating the size of the kernel and search region to adapt to different resolution requirement. However, vector Doppler is less computationally complex than speckle tracking.

=== Volumetric flow estimation ===

Velocity estimation from conventional Doppler requires knowledge of the beam-to-flow angle ([[inclination angle]]) to produce reasonable results for regular flows and does a poor job of estimating complex flow patterns, such as those due to stenosis and/or bifurcation. Volumetric flow estimation requires integrating velocity across the vessel cross-section, with assumptions about the vessel geometry, further complicating flow estimates. 2D Doppler data can be used to calculate the volumetric flow in certain integration planes.&lt;ref name="MRO"&gt;M. Richards, O. Kripfgans, J. Rubin, A. Hall and J. Fowlkes, "Mean Volume Flow Estimation in Pulsatile Flow Conditions," Ultrasound in Med. &amp; Biol., vol. 35, pp. 1880-1891, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The integration plane is chosen to be perpendicular to the beam, and Doppler power (generated from power Doppler mode of [[Doppler ultrasound]]) can be used to differentiate between the components that are inside and outside the vessel. This method does not require prior knowledge of the Doppler angle, flow profile and vessel geometry.&lt;ref name="MRO" /&gt;

== Promise of 3D ==

Until recently, ultrasound images have been 2D views and have relied on highly trained specialists to properly orient the probe and select the position within the body to image with only few and complex visual cues.  The complete measurement of 3D velocity vectors makes many post processing techniques possible. Not only is the volumetric flow across any plane measurable, but also, other physical information such as stress and pressure can be calculated based on the 3D velocity field. However, it is quite challenging to measure the complex blood flow to give velocity vectors, due to the fast acquisition rate and the massive computations needed for it. Plane wave technique is thus promising as it can generate very high frame rate.&lt;ref&gt;J. Udesen, F. Gran, K. Hansen, J. Jensen, C. Thomsen and M. Nielsen, "High Frame Rate Blood Vector Velocity Imaging Using Plane Waves: Simulations and Preliminary Experiments," IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics and Frequency Control, vol. 55, no. 8, pp. 1729-1743, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''enginator''' is an [[internal combustion engine]] whose fuel supply comes directly from underground deposits or from waste gas produced from a land fill.  Its fuel supply will last as long as the natural deposit.

Enginators are currently built by the [[Waukesha Engines]] company and have been featured on the [[Modern Marvels]] Episode "Horsepower".

'''eu.bac''' or '''European Building Automation and Controls Association''' is a [[Brussels]]-based industry platform supporting Home Controls, Building Automation and Energy Services for Buildings. It represents 25 companies. Eu.bac was founded in 2003 and allows only direct company membership. The association has offices in Brussels, [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eubac.org/about/index.html|title=eubac.org|last=Görsch|first=Sabrina|website=www.eubac.org|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The companies' activities are focused on energy controls, building automation components and systems that are used in homes and non-residential buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://evo-world.org/en/component/content/article?id=247:eubac-the-european-building-automation-controls-association-endorses-ipmvp|title=Efficiency Valuation Organization|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides efficient energy controls, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is the core of automation within a building that enables monitoring, regulation and automation to reduce the energy consumption. [[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] and comfort are the major targets of building automation and home controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eubac.org/about/homes/index.html|title=eubac.org|last=Systemadministrator|website=www.eubac.org|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within eu.bac, [http://www.euesco.org eu.ESCO] works in the field of energy services. [[Energy service company|Energy service companies (ESCOs)]] with offerings in building automation and controls are the major contributors to this group. eu.ESCO works with its own logo and identity. eu.bac is more in the field of hardware, software and systems for Building Automation.

The President of eu.bac is Jean-Yves Blanc ([[Schneider Electric]]). Vice Presidents are Ernst Malcherek ([[Honeywell]]) and Gerhard Glinzerer (Herz Armaturen).

== Certifications ==
BAC Systems and devices must comply with the standards set out by [http://www.cen.eu/CENORM/BusinessDomains/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/CENTechnicalCommittees.asp?param=6228&amp;title=CEN/TC%20247 CEN/TC 247] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100913233820/http://www.csa.ca/cm/ca/en/b214-hydronic-heating-systems ISO/TC 205] (European &amp; International Standardization Groups).

The group devised the marking scheme "eu.bac Certification for energy efficient products in the range of home controls and building automation", e.g. Electronic Radiator Thermostats, Room Thermostats, Heating controllers (OTC), Individual Zone Controllers (IZC),  etcetera.... The certification Mark was requested in France by the Reglementation Thermique&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rt-batiment.fr/batiments-neufs/reglementation-thermique-2012/presentation.html|title=RT neuf 2012 : Présentation|website=www.rt-batiment.fr|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; since RT 2005. The delivered Control Accuracy value CA is needed to calculate building energy demand.
[[File:Eubac System Label 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Example Energy Performance Building Automation System Label after revision 2014]]
In addition eu.bac set up an Energy Efficiency Label for Home Controls and Building Automation Products. This labeling scheme complements the European certification scheme and introduces a simple and market-oriented system.

For [[Building Automation|Building Automation and Controls Systems – BACS]], eu.bac set up the Certification Scheme for Energy Efficiency Performance of BACS at delivery and system lifetime. Except for this system, no reliable standards to help building owners ensure that buildings (new or refurbished) have the best available BACS technology. No standards are available to help building owners ensure that their building keeps performing as well as when it was first commissioned. The closest match to these requirements is the EN 15232 standard (Energy performance of buildings – Impact of Building Automation, Controls and Building Management) which is the base of the eu.bac system audit. The [http://system.eubac.org/ System Certification Scheme] of eu.bac addresses the principal difficulty in the BACS industry that systems may not be installed and used so as to achieve available efficiencies. It also addresses the tendency of systems to deteriorate without proper maintenance.

The recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0091:EN:NOT Directive] [http://www.managenergy.net/products/R210.htm (2002/91/EC)] attempts to reduce EU energy consumption by 5–6% (60–80 Mtoe) by 2020. The scope of the Directive includes existing buildings undergoing renovation.

The '''Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy''' ({{lang-de|Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie}}), abbreviated '''BMWi''', is a [[Cabinet of Germany|cabinet-level ministry]]  of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. It was previously known as the "Ministry of Economy". It was recreated in 2005 as "Ministry of Economics and Technology" after it had previously been merged with other ministries to form the Federal Ministry for Economics and Labour between 2002 and 2005.

== History ==
The historical predecessor of the current Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy was the ''Reichswirtschaftsamt'' (Reich Economic Office), founded in 1917. In 1919, this became the ''Reichswirtschaftsministerium'' (Reich Ministry of Economy), which existed until 1945.

In postwar occupied Germany, its functions were exercised by the Administrative Office of Economy ({{lang-de|Verwaltungsamt für Wirtschaft}}) between 1946 and 1949. After the founding of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], the Federal Ministry of Economics ({{lang-de|Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft}}) existed from 1949 to 1998. From May 1971 to December 1972, it was temporarily merged with the Federal Ministry of Finance, in the Federal Ministry of Economics and Finance. In 1998 the technology section of the Ministry of Research was added, making it the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology. Between 2002 and 2005, it was merged with parts of the former Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, in Federal Ministry for Economics and Labour. In the cabinet under Angela Merkel, the two parts were once again split up in 2005, so that there was, once again, a Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology.

== Structure ==
[[File:InvalidenstrBerlin 12-2017 img2.jpg|thumb|Headquarter]]
The Ministry is organised into 9 departments and one central department.
* Central Administration – Z
* Political Staff and Policy Planning - L
* European Policy – E
* Economic Policy – I
* Energy Policy: Heating and Efficiency – II
* Energy Policy: Electricity and Grid – III
* Industrial Policy – IV
* External Economic Policy – V
* Digital und Innovation Policy – VI
* SME Policy - VII

The ministry is headquartered in Berlin.

== Agencies ==
In addition to its own operations, the Ministry also oversees the following agencies:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmwi.de/EN/Ministry/the-ministrys-agencies.html  The Ministry's Agencies]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3585">'''Flexible carpooling''' is [[carpooling]] that is not arranged ahead of time, but instead makes use of designated meeting places.  It seeks to replicate the informal "[[slugging|slug-lines]]" that form in [[Washington DC]], [[Houston]], and [[San Francisco]], by establishing more formal locations for travelers to form carpools without advance contact.

The essence of the systems is the use of a meeting-place to form carpools, without any advance contact between the participants.  For people wishing to carpool, going to a meeting place is a very low-effort method for getting into a carpool, compared with any other system that involves contacting potential riders or drivers in advance, and arranging the trip.  The key is that other people are also coming to the meeting place, and there need to be sufficient people traveling from any one meeting-place to the common destination so that the waiting time to form a carpool is acceptable.

The Transportation Research Board is carrying out research to determine the feasibility of 'flexible carpooling to transit stations'.&lt;ref name="Transit IDEA"&gt;[http://144.171.11.40/cmsfeed/TRBNetProjectDisplay.asp?ProjectID=2697 Transit IDEA]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since fewer people are carpooling today than were thirty years ago, the federal government, as well as local governments and the Department of Defense, are trying to reverse the decline.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-08-04-carpooling-down_N.htm USA Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that San Francisco saves almost 1 million gallons of gasoline and associated emissions each year because of the operation of the informal flexible carpooling system.&lt;ref name="Estimating the Energy Consumption Impact of Casual Carpooling"&gt;[http://www.flexiblecarpooling.org/casualcarpoolingenergysaving.pdf Estimating the Energy Consumption Impact of Casual Carpooling]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==

From 1979 to 1980, [[Marin County, California]], implemented a flexible carpooling system using as meeting points several major intersections near bus stops.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Nelson D., and Susan A. Shaheen. "[http://emergingridesharingsolutions.wikispaces.com/file/view/TRB11-3038.pdf RIDESHARING IN NORTH AMERICA: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE]." Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the Washington State Legislature set aside $400,000 for a pilot project to test meeting-place based carpooling in the SR 520 corridor of Seattle.&lt;ref name="wsdot"&gt;[http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Choices/rideshare.htm Washington State Department of Transportation]&lt;/ref&gt;  This will incorporate the [[Avego]] smartphone ridematching system.

In 2010 the [[Auckland Regional Transport Authority]] considered a flexible carpooling proposal by Trip Convergence Ltd.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_4032053"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/central-leader/4032053/Easing-congestion-and-saving-money |title=Easing congestion and saving money |author=Horrell, Rhiannon |date=18 August 2010 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perchloryl Hypofluorite''' is the rarely encountered [[chemical compound]] of [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], and [[oxygen]] with the [[chemical formula]] {{chem|ClO|4F}} or {{chem|FOClO|3}}. It is an extremely unstable gas that explodes spontaneously&lt;ref&gt;Pradyot Patnaik. ''A comprehensive guide to the hazardous properties of chemical substances'', 3rd ed., Wiley-Interscience, 2007. {{ISBN|0-471-71458-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a penetrating odor.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Alan Lewis. ''Lewis' dictionary of toxicology'', CRC Press, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;508. {{ISBN|1-56670-223-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis ==

One synthesis uses fluorine and [[perchloric acid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = G. H.| first2 = G. H.| title = The Preparation of Fluorine Perchlorate from Fluorine and Perchloric Acid| journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| volume = 69| issue = 3| last1 = Rohrback| pages = 677–678| year = 1947| doi = 10.1021/ja01195a063| last2 =    Cady}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the action of [[chlorine pentafluoride|ClF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] on water is another method{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.

:&lt;chem&gt;{F2} + HClO4 -&gt; {FClO4} + HF&lt;/chem&gt;

Another method of synthesis involves the thermal decomposition of [[tetrafluoroammonium]] perchlorate, {{chem|NF|4|ClO|4}}, which yields very pure {{chem|FClO|4}} that may be manipulated and frozen without explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = C. J.| first2 = K. O.| title = Reactions of fluorine perchlorate with fluorocarbons and the polarity of the oxygen-fluorine bond in covalent hypofluorites| journal = Inorganic Chemistry| volume = 18| issue = 9| last1 = Schack| pages = 2619–2620| year = 1979| doi = 10.1021/ic50199a056| last2 =    Christe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;NF4ClO4 -&gt;[\ \Delta\ ] {NF3} + FClO4&lt;/chem&gt;

== Structure ==

Fluorine perchlorate is not analogous to perchloric acid because the fluorine atom does not exist as a positive ion. It contains an oxygen atom in a rare [[oxidation state]] of 0, due to the [[electronegativity]] of oxygen, which is higher than that of chlorine but lower than that of fluorine.

== Safety ==

FClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has a very dangerous and unpredictable series of reactions associated with it, as a covalent perchlorate (chlorine in the +7 oxidation state) and a compound featuring a very sensitive O-F single bond. Small amounts of reducing agent, such as [[organic compounds]], can trigger explosive detonation. Products of these decomposition reactions could include oxygen halides, [[interhalogen]] compounds, and other hazardous substances.

Accidental synthesis is possible if precursors are carelessly mixed. Like similar covalent fluorides and perchlorates, it needs to be handled with extreme caution.

== Reaction ==
FClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is a strong [[oxidant]] and it reacts with [[iodide]] ion:

:&lt;chem&gt;{FOClO3} + 2I^- -&gt; {ClO4^-} + {F^-} + I2&lt;/chem&gt;

[[File:80 early pcp 2.jpg|thumb|right|PDP-11 based front end processor around 1975]]
A '''front end processor''' (FEP), or a '''communications processor''', is a small-sized [[computer]] which interfaces to the [[Host (network)|host computer]] a number of [[computer network|network]]s, such as [[IBM Systems Network Architecture|SNA]], or a number of [[Peripheral|peripheral devices]], such as [[Computer terminal|terminals]], [[Hard disk drive|disk units]], [[Printer (computing)|printers]] and [[tape drive|tape units]]. Data is transferred between the host computer and the front end processor using a high-speed [[parallel interface]]. The front end processor communicates with peripheral devices using slower [[serial interface]]s, usually also through communication networks. The purpose is to off-load from the host computer the work of managing the peripheral devices, transmitting and receiving messages, packet assembly and disassembly, error detection, and error correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.inetco.com/docs/pdfs/fep02.pdf |title=Front-End Communications Processors |last1=Telfer |first1=Angus |last2= |first2= |date=15 February 2002 |website=Inetco |publisher= |access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030322140807/http://www.inetco.com/docs/pdfs/fep02.pdf|archivedate=11 September 2016|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples are the [[IBM 3705 Communications Controller]] and the [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]] Data Communications Processor.

Sometimes FEP is synonymous with a '''communications controller''', although the latter is not necessarily as flexible.  Early communications controllers such as the [[IBM 270x]] series were [[Control unit#Hardwired control unit|hard wired]], but later units were programmable devices.

Front end processor is also used in a more general sense in asymmetric multi-processor systems. The FEP is a processing device (usually a computer) which is closer to the input source than is the main processor. It performs some task such as [[telemetry]] control, data collection, reduction of raw [[sensor]] data, analysis of keyboard input, etc.

Front-end processes relates to the software interface between the user ([[client (computing)|client]]) and the application processes ([[server (computing)|server]]) in the client/server architecture. The user enters input (data) into the front-end process where it is collected and processed in such a way that it conforms to what the receiving application (back end) on the server can accept and process. As an example, the user enters a URL into a [[GUI]] (front-end process) such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. The GUI then processes the URL in such a way that the user is able to reach or access the intended web pages on the web server (application server known as the “back end” process). Front-end processors or communications processors relates to efficient use of the host CPU by off-loading processing for peripheral control, as an example, to another device or controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1972.8900|title=Communication processors|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=60|issue=11|pages=1321|year=1972|last1=Newport|first1=C.B|last2=Ryzlak|first2=J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communications FEPs in IP era ==
FEPs are responsible for linking client applications and their associated networks to host computer based applications. With the advent of the Internet and of [[Internet Protocol|IP]] as a universal protocol, it is often assumed that there is no longer any need for FEPs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns340/ns394/ns74/ns322/networking_solutions_package.html |title=IBM FRONT-END PROCESSOR REPLACEMENT SOLUTION |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Cisco Systems |publisher= |access-date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031121214306/http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns340/ns394/ns74/ns322/networking_solutions_package.html|archivedate=11 September 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which traditionally handled SNA traffic. This may be true where FEPs provide only straight connectivity (and assuming IP address never changes). However, FEPs also perform other vital functions, that are closely linked to transaction applications, including message and transaction switching, [[multiplexing]], transaction security, [[Quality of Service]] guarantors, and end-to-end transaction management and reporting. The need for these functions is especially important in mission critical transaction environments such as banking, government, point-of-sale, security, and health care applications. In these environments, FEP functionality is more necessary than ever before.

Although the IBM Corporation withdrew its [[IBM 37xx|3745/3746]] Communications Front End Processors from marketing in 2003, the company continues to maintain the estimated 20,000 installed front end processors.  IBM also provides microcode enhancement features.  Smaller companies have filled the void created by IBM's action, providing machines, features, parts and services worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="126236">The [[Giro d'Italia]] ({{IPA-it|ˈdʒiːro diˈtaːlja}}; {{lang-en|Tour of Italy}}) is an annual [[stage race]] [[bicycle racing|bicycle race]] primarily held in [[Italy]], while also occasionally passing through nearby countries. The race was first organized in [[1909 Giro d'Italia|1909]] to increase sales of the newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]''; however it is currently run by [[RCS Sport]]. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1909, except when it was stopped for the two [[world war]]s. As the Giro gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened, and the peloton expanded from primarily Italian participation to riders from all over the world.

The first edition of the race was won by Italian [[Luigi Ganna]] who had the fewest total points at the end of the race; the same format was used for the next two years and also resulted in an Italian cyclist winning. The [[1912 Giro d'Italia|1912 Giro]] saw the [[General classification in the Giro d'Italia|general classification]] contested by teams, which [[Atala (cycling team)|Atala-Dunlop]] won by ten points. The [[1913 Giro d'Italia|following year]] they reverted to the original system, before switching to the aggregate time model in [[1914 Giro d'Italia|1914]]. [[Alfredo Binda]] won five editions of the race over a period of nine years, before [[Gino Bartali]] and [[Fausto Coppi]] consistently asserted their superiority in the Giro d'Italia. Italians dominated the race for forty years before the first non-Italian, [[Hugo Koblet]], in [[1950 Giro d'Italia|1950]].

After Koblet became the first foreigner to win the Giro, the Italians won the majority of the races held until [[1968 Giro d'Italia|1968]]. In 1968, the Belgian [[Eddy Merckx]] won his first Giro d'Italia, which were soon followed by four more victories. [[Bernard Hinault]] won the first of his three Giros d'Italia in [[1980 Giro d'Italia|1980]]. Ireland's [[Stephen Roche]] won the [[1987 Giro d'Italia|1987 race]] en route to winning the [[Triple Crown of Cycling]]. Spanish rider [[Miguel Indurain]] won two consecutive Giros d'Italia, in 1992 and 1993, with his victories being followed by wins by [[Evgeni Berzin]], [[Tony Rominger]], and [[Pavel Tonkov]]. The next ten editions of the race were won by Italian riders, including the likes of [[Marco Pantani]], [[Paolo Savoldelli]], and [[Gilberto Simoni]].

Spain's [[Alberto Contador]] won the [[2008 Giro d'Italia]] en route to completing the rare Giro-Vuelta double for the season. The [[2009 Giro d'Italia|2009 race]] celebrated the hundredth year since the first edition of the Giro d'Italia and was won by the Russian [[Denis Menchov]]. The [[2010 Giro d'Italia|following year]] saw [[Ivan Basso]] win his second overall race. Contador originally won the [[2011 Giro d'Italia]], but after a positive drug test result was found, his victory was stripped and given to [[Michele Scarponi]]. [[Vincenzo Nibali]], the winner of the 2013 race, led the event from the race's eighth stage and on.

==1908–1909: The idea and first race==

[[File:1234883933LuigiGanna-Milaan-1909.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Luigi Ganna]] the winner of the inaugural Giro d'Italia.|alt=A cyclist sitting down.]]

[[Tom Dumoulin]] won the 100th Giro in 2017, the first time ever that a Dutch cyclist won the Giro.  He was also the first Dutchman to win the overall in a Grand Tour since [[Joop Zoetemelk]] won the 1980 Tour de France.  A year later, [[Chris Froome]] won the 2018 Giro, becoming the first British rider to win the overall race.

The '''Hytort process''' is an above-ground [[shale oil extraction]] process developed by the [[Gas Technology Institute|Institute of Gas Technology]].  It is classified as a reactive fluid process,&lt;ref name=AICHE&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which produces [[shale oil]] by [[hydrogenation]].  

The Hytort process has advantages when processing oil shales containing less hydrogen, such as the eastern [[United States]] [[Devonian]] [[oil shale]]s.  In this process, oil shale is processed at controlled heating rates in a high-pressure hydrogen environment, which allows a carbon conversion rate of around 80%.&lt;ref name=hytort2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Hydrogen reacts with coke [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] (a chemical structure in the oil shale that is prone to form char during retorting but has not yet done so). In the case of Eastern US Devonian shales, the reaction roughly doubles the yield of oil, depending on the characteristics of the oil shale and process.&lt;ref name=hytort&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2800">The '''International Committee for the History of Technology''' (ICOHTEC) was founded at a meeting of the International Congress on the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine&lt;ref&gt;http://www.histnet.cnrs.fr/research/sfhst/spip.php?article222&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris in the summer of 1968. Its founding was the brainchild of [[Melvin Kranzberg]], Professor of the History of Technology at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States. Kranzberg had already established the [[Society for the History of Technology]] (SHOT) and its journal, ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', but he felt that in the midst of Cold War tensions, there was a need for another forum that focused on crossing the artificial borders of the Iron Curtain. For Kranzberg, the History of Technology, a new discipline not yet burdened with ideological or political freight as were other branches of history, was an ideal arena where scholars from East and West could find common ground. Kranzberg was supported in this effort by Maurice Daumas from France, Eugene Olszewski from Poland, and S.J. Schuchardine from the USSR, among others. For the past several decades, ICOHTEC's principal activity has been an ''annual meeting'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icohtec.org/annual-meeting-current.html&lt;/ref&gt;  where scholars from many countries and from many disclipines gather and share their work. Papers presented at the meetings are usually published in the Committee's annual journal ''ICON''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icohtec.org/publications-icon.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Kranzberg’s vision was largely fulfilled in the meetings that followed, although exchanges among scholars were not always harmonious.  Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in the years that followed, ICOHTEC lost its original reason for being. But it has thrived in the following years and continues to have an active international membership and hold well-attended and intellectually lively meetings. One reason is the perception that its sister society, SHOT, remains somewhat biased toward U.S. membership in spite of efforts to reach out more to an international audience.
&lt;!-- 


ICOHTEC had a very successful meeting [http://www.conferences.hu/ichs09/index.htm] in Budapest, Hungary in 2009. 

In 2010 it held a joint meeting in Tampere, Finland with [[The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage]] (TICCIH) and The International Association of the Labour Museums (WORKLAB), around the theme ‘Reusing the Industrial Past’.

'''Jerzy Sikorski''' (born July 25, 1935) is a Polish historian, [[Copernicus|Copernicologist]], [[medievalist]], [[museologist]], author, publisher, journalist, and encyclopedist, who writes and publishes primarily in Polish.  He is a resident of [[Olsztyn]], Poland.

==Life==
===Early life===
Jerzy Sikorski was born on July 25, 1935 in [[Vilnius]] ([[Polish language|Polish]]: Wilno), to Anna Wołk-Lewanowicz (1914–1995) and Feliks Sikorski (1889–1980).  Five years later (1940) Sikorski's sister Maria Danuta was born.

In October 1944, during [[World War II]], Sikorski's mother Anna was arrested by the [[People's Commissariat for State Security]] along with 40 other people, when she was exposed as a courier between Vilnius' "Kedyw" and the general staff of the Polish [[Home Army]]. Early in January 1945 Sikorski's father Feliks was also arrested because he was a soldier of the 1st Polish Corps under the [[Poland|Polish]] general [[Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki]] in the ''Polish-Soviet War,'', but he was released after three months. Upon his release, Feliks made efforts to obtain Anna's release from prison, locate and take care of Jerzy and Maria, and reunite his family. Anna was released from prison camp in June 1946, and the family moved to Olsztyn. They chose Olsztyn based on the fact that most of the Vilnius board of education where Feliks once worked had been evacuated to Olsztyn, and Feliks could resume his position there.&lt;ref name=js2012&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (2012).

===Education===
Following World War II, Sikorski's mother was prevented from teaching due to political persecution. After Sikorski graduated from high school in 1953, he was repeatedly denied entry to university in spite of passing exams in [[Gdańsk]], [[Warsaw]], [[Toruń]], and [[Poznań]]. Each time, he received the characteristic preprinted postcard with "not accepted due to lack of space".   On the advice of a Polish studies specialist teacher (Polish [[philologist]]), Janina Kirkicka, Sikorski was able to enroll in a two-year teacher's college in Olsztyn, but after two weeks the director Bolesław Wytrążek instructed Sikorski to leave the college, due the decision of the local [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) in [[Olsztyn]].  Through [[:pl:Hieronim_Skurpski|Hieronim Skurpski]], who was the director at the Museum of [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]] located at [[Olsztyn Castle]], Sikorski obtained employment (1954–1955) at the [[:pl:Muzeum Mikołaja Kopernika we Fromborku|Nicolas Copernicus Museum in Frombork]], which was under the patronage of the regional museum in Olsztyn.  The work at Frombork’s museum and the person of the great Polish Astronomer [[Nicolas Copernicus]], who spent most of his life in Frombork and Warmia region, made a lasting impression on Sikorski. As a result, Copernicus and ''Copernicana'' research became the dominant subject in Sikorski's lifetime work and in his professional affiliations with various research centers. Ultimately, it led to Sikorski's discovery and publication of Copernicus' resting place at Frombork’s cathedral in 1973, which was confirmed archaeologically in 2005.

In the fall of 1955 Sikorski enrolled at the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń]], where he chose to study under professor [[:pl:Karol Górski|Karol Górski]], who among other scholarly pursuits studied and researched the life and politics of Copernicus' maternal uncle, Bishop [[Lucas Watzenrode]].&lt;ref name=gorski1973&gt;Górski Karol (1973). ''Łukasz Watzenrode. Życie i działalność polityczna (1447–1512).'' Wrocław 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sikorski wrote his master’s thesis on Watzenrode, and   subsequently wrote his doctoral dissertation "Polish monarchy and Warmia at the end of the 15th century:  Issues in systemic-law and politics".&lt;ref name=js1978&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1978).  ''Monarchia polska i Warmia u schyłku XV wieku. Zagadnienia prawno-ustrojowe i polityczne''. Olsztyn, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completing of his academic studies at the Nicolas Copernicus University in Toruń in 1960, Sikorski accepted a position at the Museum of Warmia at [[Lidzbark Warmiński Castle]], where Copernicus spent at least seven years (1503–1509). Copernicus had strong ties to the city of Lidzbark, and had visited there at the invitation of his maternal uncle Bishop Lucas Watzenrode in 1495. Sikorski worked at the museum from 1961 to 1962.

Lidzbark Warmiński Castle was of substantial significance for Jerzy Sikorski's ''Copernicana'' studies in terms of the history of astronomy; as well as because the castle was a strongly fortified seat of the bishops of Warmia and the administration center of their lands  from the second half of the 14th century. At that time, Lidzbark city had one of the largest populations in Warmia, similar to [[Braniewo]].  In Lidzbark, Sikorski researched historic documents pertaining to the history of Poland's [[Baltic Sea|Baltic seashore]] ([[Pomerania]], [[Warmia]], [[Mazury]], [[Prussia]]), and its extant architectural relics, documents, and other materials relating to Nicolaus Copernicus.  Following the death of bishop Watzenrode in Toruń on March 29, 1512, Copernicus only sporadically visited Lidzbark, either as an emissary of the Warmia Chapter, or as a personal medical doctor for the successive bishops: [[:pl:Fabian Luzjański|Fabian Luzjański]] (d. 1523), [[Mauritius Ferber]] (Polish: Maurycy Ferber 1471–1537), and [[Johannes Dantiscus]] (Polish: Jan Dantyszek; 1485–1548).&lt;ref name=js2012/&gt;

==Author==
An organized index of published books and articles by Sikorski is listed at [http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/lista-publikacji his web portal], covering four areas of research: 1. Copernicana; 2.  Cities and castles of Prussia; 3.  Historic tradition of the region; and, 4. The History of Science.

An additional indexed list of Sikorski's complete articles and papers is available online at the [http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/baza-artykulow Database of Articles] (in Polish), including two English language papers: "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/empirical-table-olsztyn-question-nicolaus-copernicus-scientific-workshop The Empirical Table of Olsztyn the Question of Nicolaus Copernicus' Scientific Workshop]", and "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/practice-bishops-burials-frombork-cathedral-and-question-grave-nicolaus-copernicus-s-uncle The Practice of Bishops' Burials in Frombork Cathedral and the Question of the Grave of Nicolaus Copernicus' Uncle Łukasz Watzenrode]".
       
In 1973, in time for the 500th anniversary of Nicolas Copernicus' birth, Sikorski authored a popular [[monograph]] on the astronomer's life, work, and times.&lt;ref name=js1973&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1973).

==Journalist==
Between 1966 and 2007 Jerzy Sikorski published a number of articles in ''Mazury-Warmian Communications'' (''[[:pl:Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie|Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie]]''), on the history of [[Poland]]'s ancestral [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seashore [[Pomerania]], and the Polish regions of [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]]. He also published articles on the life and activities of the Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].&lt;ref name=js1969&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1969).

===Copernicus' Polish nationality and descent===
[[File:Locationes mansorum desertorum Nicolaus Copernicus.JPG|thumb| Nicolaus [Nicolas] Copernicus' extant manuscript, 15 pages –  ''Locationes mansorum desertorum'' (''Allocation of abandoned fiefs'')]]
Reviewing the document ''Locationes mansorum desertorum'' (''Allocation of abandoned fiefs''), which was written by Copernicus in the region of Olsztyn Castle, Olsztyn, Poland, Jerzy Sikorski discovered that, out of the 136 names of allocation of fiefs, 60 were Polish names (peasants had only first names) written in phonetically correct Polish.&lt;ref name=js2011/&gt;{{rp|131}}  Sikorski also cites an extant document where Copernicus’ witness was Copernicus’ Polish servant: ''Wojciech Cebulski''.&lt;ref name=js2011/&gt;{{rp|128}} These documents indicate that Copernicus spoke and wrote Polish.

Copernicus to king Sigismund I of Poland 16-XI-1520 A.jpg|thumb|Letter of Warmia Chapter to King Sigismund I of Poland, handwritten by Nicolas Copernicus in Olsztyn Castle, November 16, 1520 ''(or. Staatliches Archivlager, Göttingen, OBA – 16 XI 1520 d); older signature: Aus D 641.'']]
In a letter to king Sigismund I of Poland handwritten by Nicolas Copernicus in Olsztyn Castle, the administrator, chancellor, and commander in chief of the defense of Olsztyn Castle Copernicus and Warmia Canons together affirm their Polish nationality as subjects to King Sigismund I of Poland against the enemy, the German Teutonic Order. The writers say that they are willing to die defending Olsztyn Castle, Warmia, and Poland from the Teutonic Knights.  Nicolas Copernicus is directly associated with Sigismund I of Poland in the wars against the Teutonic Order, the reform of royal mints and the minting of coins, in establishing modern market economy in 16th century Poland, in direct contacts with king's personal medical doctor, with Cracow (Kraków) and the Jagiellonian University, and with the Polish Roman Catholic Church in Cracow.

Sikorski wrote "the intellectual adventure of my life were my discoveries of Copernicus’ Polish ancestry and nationality".&lt;ref name=js2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=fedo2015&gt;Fedoniuk B. (2015).

===Copernicus’ resting place===
[[File:Jerzy Sikorski locates Copernicus’ grave in 1973.jpg|thumb|Photographs of Copernicus' 1735 and 1973 epitaphia, the altar of St. Wacław (altar of the Holy Cross), where his grave is located,&lt;ref name=js1973/&gt;{{rp|193}} and the 2010 monument to Copernicus]]

Copernicus was reportedly buried in [[Frombork Cathedral]], but archaeologists searched there in vain for centuries for his remains. Efforts to locate the remains in 1581, 1626, 1802, 1909, 1939 and 2004 came to nought. In 1973 Dr Jerzy Sikorski published the location of Copernicus' resting place in his book, including the photo of the Altar of Saint Wacław, today Altar of Saint Cross, with a subscription (English translation of Polish) "The remains of Mikołaj Kopernik rest unnamed next to this altar".&lt;ref name=js1973/&gt;{{rp|193}}

===Location of Copernicus’ observatories===

[[File:Frombork-Cathedral-Altars-Tower-Curia-4b-final.jpg|thumb|Photographs of Frombork Cathedral and defensive walls, Copernicus’ extant Canonic Curia inside the walls (''Curiae intra muros''), and the location of Copernicus’ no-longer-extant Canonic Curia outside walls (''Curiae extra muros'').]]

Sikorski discovered the location of Copernicus' Canonic Curia outside the walls of Frombork (the ''Curiae extra muros'').&lt;ref name=js1969/&gt;{{cn|reason=Need a reference to a reliable secondary source.|date=September 2018}}  The building is not extant, having been burned by Teutonic Knights on February 1, 1520, but the foundation remains. 

Sikorski searched the area nearby with instruments such as [[ground-penetrating radar]] in an effort to find Copernicus’ observatory "pavimentum", which was believed to have been nearby, but did not find it.
Sikorski was aided in the search by the notebook of Elias Olsen, who was sent by [[Tycho Brahe]] to Frombork in 1584 to use the still-extant ''pavimentum'' to obtain astronomic observations for comparison with those of Copernicus. {{As of|2011}} the ''pavimentum'' has still not been located. Its foundations may have been destroyed during extensive ground works near Copernicus’ external curia.  

Sikorski since 1973 researched and wrote on Copernicus' observatory in Olsztyn, which contains a still-extant plaster astronomical table that was used by Copernicus from 1516 to 1521.

==Recognition==
Sikorski has been awarded Polish presidential medals for his professional work as a historian and Copernicologist: the [[Gold Cross of Merit]] (1975) and Knight's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] (1986).&lt;ref&gt;Formal statement from the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland, BON – Department of Orders and Decorations, Reference: BON.0600.454.2.2017, July 27, 2017, Warsaw, addressed and forwarded by BON to Mr Artur Chojecki, the Province Region Governor of Warmia &amp; Mazury.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the fifteenth anniversary of the Warmia-Mazury Business Club, the President of Poland Lech Kaczyński gave presidential orders and awards to deserving club members. On March 28, 2008, the title "Personality of the Year 2008 in Warmia and Mazury" was awarded to Jerzy Sikorski for his research into the life and science of Nicolas Copernicus, and for his 1973 discovery of Copernicus's resting place.

In January 2017, the FDA approved the investigational new drug application, NanoLiposome, to assess the product as a form of treatment for solid tumors. Phase 1 trials will take place at the University of Maryland, University of Virginia, and the Medical University of South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Approves Investigational New Drug Application for Ceramide NanoLiposome|url=http://www.pharmacytimes.com/product-news/fda-approves-investigational-new-drug-application-for-ceramide-nanoliposome|website=Pharmacy Times|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compound ==
Keystone was recently approved to begin clinical trials to assess ceramide nanoliposome for possible use in treating cancer. It's known as an anticancer therapeutic agent, that targets tumors specifically. Once the compound penetrates the cellular lining of the tumor, and only then, it releases the chemotherapeutic cargo. This allows the compound to destroy cancer cells without impacting and healthy cells. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigational cancer compound receives FDA approval to begin human trials|url=http://news.psu.edu/story/473555/2017/06/29/research/investigational-cancer-compound-receives-fda-approval-begin-human|website=Penn State News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khibiny''' (L-175V) (Хибины) (Л-175В) is Soviet / Russian aircraft [[electronic countermeasures|electronic countermeasures (ECM)]] system.

The system is designed for [[radio direction-finding]] and probing signal source irradiation allowing it to distort reflected signal parameters. This helps to

*Delay aircraft detection;
*Mask the true subject against false reflections;
*Cause range finding difficulties, namely in speed and angular positions;
*Degrading Maintenance Mode "on the aisle" when scanning antenna beam radar;
*Increase the time and difficulty of capturing an object during real-time active scanning.

==History==
The first work related to the creation ECM "Khibiny" began in the Kaluga Research Institute of Radio Engineering (KRIRE; [[Russian language|Russian]]:'' Калужский научно-исследовательский радиотехнический институт'') in 1977. The plan was to create a unified set of electronic countermeasures for all the armed forces, where the tasks for KRIRE was to develop  [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]] blocks of equipment "Proran" and radio jammer ([[Radio jamming|RJ]]) "Regatta", which was successfully completed with protected of scientific research in 1980.&lt;ref name="КНИРТИ"&gt;{{cite book |author= Топорков, Никита Валентинович |title="Хибины" - автоматизированный комплекс защиты самолетов ("Khibiny" - automated complex aircraft protection) |chapter= 55. Мы не боялись быть первыми (We were not afraid to be the first) |location= [[Kaluga]] |publisher=Kaluga Research Institute of Radio Engineering |year=2012 |pages=136–141|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 KRIRE was entrusted with [[research and development]] activities, first with "Proran" and "Regatta", and after an ECM as a whole, which includes many developments on related topics (including the use of accumulated experience in the development of RJ " Sorption ", which was planned to be installed on the Su-27 ). When started research and development with new ECM, later named "Khibiny", it was intended to unite all the units, ensuring that they work closely with the Jets avionics.&lt;ref name="КНИРТИ" /&gt;

The first samples of "Khibiny" were far from ideal as to their weight and size parameters were not suitable for installation on the aircraft. To solve this problem KRIRE collaborated closely with Sukhoi, working under the direction of Rollan G. Martirosov. Collaborate on a plane integrated ECM (received code "product L-175V") bore little resemblance to the conventional practice in such cases. Typically, the manufacturer of equipment issues to aircraft design bureau specification for the placement of products that represent a complete set of design documents and makes recommendations on placement of its parts with the restrictions on the length of the connections between them. In this case, the equipment "Khibiny" was immediately inserted into the design of the aircraft under development. As a result of close co-operation by the end of the 1980s the first stage of [[R&amp;D]] was completed.&lt;ref name="КНИРТИ" /&gt; March 18, 2014 was adopted the fighter-bomber Su-34, equipped with electronic countermeasures complex L-175V "Khibiny".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.knirti.com/press/detail.php?ID=145&lt;/ref&gt; Upgraded Khibiny EW complexes join air units in course of modernization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armstrade.org/includes/periodics/news/2018/0619/095547280/detail.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

For over half of century, the technology of [[microelectronics]] has been advancing by [[miniaturization]], leading to significant increases in computing power and continuous decreases in manufacturing cost. In parallel, remarkable progress on enlarging system scale in recent years gives rise to a nascent field known as '''macroelectronics''', in which microelectronic devices are distributed yet integrated over large area substrates with sizes much bigger than [[semiconductor]] [[wafers]].

Currently, the macroelectronics industry is dramatically growing in the similar way as the microelectronics was in early ’90s. The most visible example of macroelectronics at present is [[flat-panel display]]s, which have been rapidly replacing cathode-ray tubes as the monitors of choice for computers and televisions since 2000. The flat-panel displays have enabled applications unimaginable for cathode-ray tubes. For example, the Dolphins Stadium in Miami will soon have the world's largest high definition video display, about 15 m high and 42 m wide, comprising more than 4.6 million [[light-emitting diode]]s, showing image of more than 1.5 million pixels.

While the commercial success of flat-panel display opens an era of large area electronics, other emerging applications, such as [[rollable display]], printable [[thin film solar cell]] and [[electronic skin]], demonstrate further desirable attributes for macroelectronic systems, including flexibility, portability and low-cost. To realize these attributes, a growing trend is to fabricate macroelectronic products directly on flexible substrates, such as [[polymer]]s. The flat-panel displays currently available in market are fabricated on glass substrates and are fragile. A case in recent news is the cracking of the screens of the [[iPod nano]], a music player that [[Apple Computer]] expects to be its best-selling portable device. By contrast, displays made on thin polymer substrates are rugged. Flexible displays of large areas will be lightweight and can be rolled up – they will be portable. For example, in Sept. 2005, [[Philips]] [[Polymer Vision]] has revealed the world's first prototype of a rollable electronic reader, which can unfold to a 5-inch display and roll back into a pocket-size (100×60×20&amp;nbsp;mm) device. Furthermore, such thin-film devices on flexible polymer substrates can lend themselves to low-cost fabrication process (i.e., [[roll-to-roll printing]]), resulting in lightweight, rugged and flexible macroelectronic products.

'''MicroImages''', Inc. is a [[software development]] company in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] founded in 1986.  MicroImages' software products include [[TNTmips]] and [[TNTlite]] for [[GIS]] and image processing.  The TNT products also support [[web mapping]] applications.  MicroImages serves professional clients in over 120 nations around the world.

==General Information==

{{Empty section|date=April 2013}}

==History==
MicroImages was founded in 1983 by Dr. Lee D. Miller, and Michael J. Unverferth, with its first software product, the Map and Image Processing System (MIPS). MIPS had been developed in a university setting for image processing on microcomputers. Since 1986, MicroImages has released over 50 consecutive upgrades to MIPS, which evolved into a broad, integrated system that includes features for image processing, GIS, CAD, TIN, desktop cartography, spatial database management and visualization. In 1993, MIPS was renamed TNTmips®, rewritten with a standard [[X Window System|X Window]] interface, and made available for all Windows and Mac computers.

==Purpose==
MicroImages operates solely for software development, manufacturing, distribution, and support. The company performs no service work, consulting, or data collection activities, since by so doing it would be in direct competition with its customers and resellers. MicroImages does not manufacture any computer equipment, although MicroImages does occasionally provide system integration assistance and other specialized consulting services.

MicroImages Press, a division of MicroImages, provides educational and training materials to support the integration of image processing, GIS, CAD, TIN, desktop cartography, spatial database management, visualization, and related objectives with the TNT products. The Press currently maintains and publishes color illustrated materials that include a series of free Tutorial booklets, Technical Guides, and Quick Guides. Documentation is available on the MicroImages web site in PDF format.

==Support==
MicroImages, Inc. maintains an experienced staff of technical support specialists with computer science or related degrees. These professionals provide direct world-wide support to MicroImages' clients without cost, and also manage the TNT products releases. MicroImages' phones are answered directly by real people and not by recorded messages or selection menus. Hundreds of international FAXes and email requests for assistance are also answered weekly.

==Authorized Resellers==

All MicroImages' independent Resellers actually use the TNT products. As a result, they have the experience to help you design your individual projects or a company or organization-wide geospatial solution.

From their own experience in the use of these products these Resellers can answer your questions with regard to what the TNT products can, and cannot do for you in your language. In the case where they are unable to answer your questions they will communicate them to MicroImages to get your answers.

You can get the TNT products either from our consultants, resellers, or directly from MicroImages, Inc.

A '''microbial electrolysis cell''' ('''MEC''') is a technology related to [[Microbial fuel cell]]s (MFC). Whilst MFCs produce an [[electric current]] from the microbial decomposition of organic compounds, MECs partially reverse the process to generate [[hydrogen]] or [[methane]] from organic material by applying an electric current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badwal|first1=SPS|title=Emerging electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies|journal=Frontiers in Chemistry|volume=2|doi=10.3389/fchem.2014.00079|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fchem.2014.00079/abstract|pmid=25309898|pmc=4174133|year=2014|page=79|bibcode=2014FrCh....2...79B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electric current would ideally be produced by a renewable source of power. The hydrogen or methane produced can be used to produce electricity by means of an additional PEM fuel cell or internal combustion engine.

==Microbial electrolysis cells==
MEC systems are based on a number of components:

'''Microorganisms''' – are attached to the anode. The identity of the microorganisms determines the products and efficiency of the MEC.

'''Materials''' – The anode material in a MEC can be the same as an MFC, such as carbon cloth, carbon paper, graphite felt, graphite granules or graphite brushes. Platinum can be used as a catalyst to reduce the [[overpotential]] required for hydrogen production. The high cost of platinum is driving research into biocathodes as an alternative. Or as other alternative for catalyst, the stainless steel plates were used as cathode and anode materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032113007715|title=Development of biohydrogen production by photobiological, fermentation and electrochemical processes: A review|first1=M.

==Generating hydrogen==
[[Exoelectrogen|Electrogenic microorganisms]] consuming an energy source (such as [[acetic acid]]) release electrons and protons, creating an [[voltage|electrical potential]] of up to 0.3 volts. In a conventional MFC, this voltage is used to generate electrical power. In a MEC, an additional voltage is supplied to the cell from an outside source. The combined voltage is sufficient to [[redox reaction|reduce]] protons, producing hydrogen gas. As part of the energy for this reduction is derived from bacterial activity, the total electrical energy that has to be supplied is less than for [[electrolysis of water]] in the absence of microbes. Hydrogen production has reached up to 3.12 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;d with an input voltage of 0.8 volts. The efficiency of hydrogen production depends on which organic substances are used. Lactic and acetic acid achieve 82% efficiency, while the values for unpretreated cellulose or glucose are close to 63%.&lt;br /&gt;
The efficiency of normal water electrolysis is 60 to 70 percent. As MEC’s convert unusable biomass into usable hydrogen, they can produce 144% more usable energy than they consume as electrical energy.&lt;br /&gt; Depending on the organisms present at the cathode, MECs can also produce methane by a related mechanism.

'''Calculations'''&lt;br /&gt;Overall hydrogen recovery was calculated as ''RH''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''R''&lt;sub&gt;Cat&lt;/sub&gt;. The Coulombic efficiency is ''C''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;=(''n''&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt;/''n''&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; is the moles of hydrogen that could be theoretically produced and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt; = ''C''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;/(2''F'') is the moles of hydrogen that could be produced from the measured current, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; is the total coulombs calculated by integrating the current over time, ''F'' is Faraday's constant, and 2 is the moles of electrons per mole of hydrogen. The cathodic hydrogen recovery was calculated as ''R''&lt;sub&gt;Cat&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;H2&lt;/sub&gt;/''n''&lt;sub&gt;CE&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;H2&lt;/sub&gt; is the total moles of hydrogen produced. Hydrogen yield (''Y''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was calculated as ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;H2&lt;/sub&gt; /''n''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is substrate removal calculated on the basis of chemical oxygen demand (22).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/47/18871.full.pdf+html|title=Sustainable and efficient biohydrogen production via electrohydrogenesis|date=20 November 2007|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=104|issue=47|pages=18871–18873|doi=10.1073/pnas.0706379104|pmid=18000052|pmc=2141869|author1=Shaoan Cheng|author2=Bruce E. Logan|bibcode=2007PNAS..10418871C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Hydrogen and methane can both be used as alternatives to fossil fuels in [[internal combustion engines]] or for power generation. Like MFCs or [[bioethanol]] production plants, MECs have the potential to convert waste organic matter into a valuable energy source. Hydrogen can also be combined with the nitrogen in the air to produce ammonia, which can be used to make ammonium fertilizer. Ammonia has been proposed as a practical alternative to fossil fuel for internal combustion engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.psu.edu/story/27233|title=Penn State Live|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53212">The '''nuclear fuel cycle''', also called '''nuclear fuel chain''', is the progression of [[nuclear fuel]] through a series of differing stages. It consists of steps in the ''front end'', which are the preparation of the fuel, steps in the ''service period'' in which the fuel is used during reactor operation, and steps in the ''back end'', which are necessary to safely manage, contain, and either [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocess]] or dispose of [[used nuclear fuel|spent nuclear fuel]]. If spent fuel is not reprocessed, the fuel cycle is referred to as an ''open fuel cycle'' (or a ''once-through fuel cycle''); if the spent fuel is reprocessed, it is referred to as a ''closed fuel cycle''.

==Basic concepts==

[[Nuclear power]] relies on fissionable material that can sustain a [[nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]] with [[neutron]]s. Examples of such materials include [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]]. Most nuclear reactors use a [[Neutron moderator|moderator]] to lower the [[kinetic energy]] of the neutrons and increase the probability that [[Nuclear fission|fission]] will occur. This allows reactors to use material with far lower concentration of [[fissile]] [[isotopes]] than are needed for [[nuclear weapon]]s.  [[Graphite]] and [[heavy water]] are the most effective moderators, because they slow the neutrons through collisions without absorbing them. [[Nuclear reactor technology|Reactors]] using [[Heavy water reactor|heavy water]] or graphite as the moderator can operate using [[natural uranium]].

A [[light water reactor]] (LWR) uses water in the form that occurs in nature, and requires fuel enriched to higher concentrations of fissile isotopes. Typically, LWRs use uranium [[Enriched uranium|enriched]] to 3–5% content of the less common isotope [[U-235]], the only fissile isotope that is found in significant quantity in nature. One alternative to this low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel are [[MOX fuel|mixed oxide]] (MOX) fuels produced by blending plutonium with natural or depleted uranium, and these fuels provide an avenue to utilize surplus [[weapons-grade]] plutonium. Another type of MOX fuel involves mixing LEU with [[Thorium fuel cycle|thorium]], which generates the fissile isotope [[Uranium-233|U-233]]. Both plutonium and U-233 are produced from the absorption of neutrons by [[irradiating]] [[fertile material]]s in a reactor, in particular the common uranium isotope [[Uranium-238|U-238]] and [[thorium]], respectively, and can be separated from spent uranium and thorium fuels in [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing plants]].

Some reactors do not use moderators to slow the neutrons. Like nuclear weapons, which also use unmoderated or "fast" neutrons, these [[fast-neutron reactor]]s require much higher concentrations of fissile isotopes in order to sustain a chain reaction. They are also capable of [[Breeder reactor|breeding]] fissile isotopes from fertile materials; a [[breeder reactor]] is one that generates more fissile material in this way than it consumes.

During the nuclear reaction inside a reactor, the fissile isotopes in nuclear fuel are consumed, producing more and more [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]], most of which are considered [[radioactive waste]]. The buildup of fission products and consumption of fissile isotopes eventually stop the nuclear reaction, causing the fuel to become a [[spent nuclear fuel]]. When 3% enriched LEU fuel is used, the spent fuel typically consists of roughly 1% U-235, 95% U-238, 1% plutonium and 3% fission products. Spent fuel and other high-level radioactive waste is extremely hazardous, although nuclear reactors produce relatively small volumes of waste compared to other power plants because of the high energy density of nuclear fuel. Safe management of these byproducts of nuclear power, including their storage and disposal, is a difficult problem for any country using nuclear power.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Exploration===
A deposit of uranium, such as [[uraninite]], discovered by geophysical techniques, is evaluated and sampled to determine the amounts of uranium materials that are extractable at specified costs from the deposit. Uranium reserves are the amounts of ore that are estimated to be recoverable at stated costs.

Naturally occurring uranium consists primarily of two isotopes U-238 and U-235, with 99.28% of the metal being U-238 while 0.71% is U-235, and the remaining 0.01% is mostly U-234. The number in such names refers to the [[isotope]]'s atomic [[mass number]], which is the number of [[proton]]s plus the number of [[neutron]]s in the [[atomic nucleus]].

The atomic nucleus of U-235 will nearly always fission when struck by a [[free neutron]], and the isotope is therefore said to be a "[[fissile]]" isotope. The nucleus of a U-238 atom on the other hand, rather than undergoing fission when struck by a free neutron, will nearly always absorb the neutron and yield an atom of the isotope U-239. This isotope then undergoes natural radioactive decay to yield Pu-239, which, like U-235, is a fissile isotope. The atoms of U-238 are said to be fertile, because, through neutron irradiation in the core, some eventually yield atoms of fissile Pu-239.

===Mining===
{{Main|Uranium mining}}
Uranium ore can be extracted through conventional mining in open pit and underground methods similar to those used for mining other metals. [[In-situ leach]] [[mining]] methods also are used to mine uranium in the [[United States]]. In this technology, uranium is leached from the in-place ore through an array of regularly spaced wells and is then recovered from the leach solution at a surface plant. Uranium ores in the United States typically range from about 0.05 to 0.3% uranium oxide (U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;). Some uranium deposits developed in other countries are of higher grade and are also larger than deposits mined in the United States. Uranium is also present in very low-grade amounts (50 to 200 parts per million) in some domestic [[phosphate]]-bearing deposits of marine origin. Because very large quantities of phosphate-bearing rock are mined for the production of wet-process [[phosphoric acid]] used in high analysis [[fertilizer]]s and other phosphate chemicals, at some phosphate processing plants the uranium, although present in very low concentrations, can be economically recovered from the process stream.

===Milling===
Mined uranium ores normally are processed by [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] the ore materials to a uniform particle size and then treating the ore to extract the uranium by chemical leaching. The milling process commonly yields dry powder-form material consisting of natural uranium, "[[yellowcake]]", which is sold on the uranium market as U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. Note that the material isn't always yellow.

===Uranium conversion===
Usually milled Uranium oxide, U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Triuranium octaoxide]]) is then processed into either of two substances depending on the intended use.

For use in most reactors U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is usually converted to [[Uranium hexafluoride]] (UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), the input stock for most commercial uranium enrichment facilities. A solid at room temperature, uranium hexafluoride becomes gaseous at 57&amp;nbsp;°C (134&amp;nbsp;°F). At this stage of the cycle the uranium hexafluoride conversion product still has the natural isotopic mix (99.28% of U-238 plus 0.71% of U-235).

For use in reactors such as [[CANDU]] which do not require enriched fuel, the U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; may instead be converted to [[uranium dioxide]] (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which can be included in [[ceramic]] fuel elements.

In the current nuclear industry the volume of material converted directly to UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is typically quite small compared to that converted to UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Enrichment===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Nuclear proliferation]] --&gt;
{{Main|Enriched uranium}}
[[Image:Nuclear Fuel Cycle.png|330px|thumb|'''Nuclear fuel cycle''' begins when uranium is mined, enriched and manufactured to nuclear fuel (1) which is delivered to a nuclear power plant. After usage in the power plant the spent fuel is delivered to a reprocessing plant (if fuel is recycled) (2) or to a final repository (if no recycling is done) (3) for geological disposition. In [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] 95% of spent fuel can be recycled to be returned to usage in a nuclear power plant (4).]]

The natural concentration (0.71%) of the fissionable isotope U-235 is less than that required to sustain a nuclear chain reaction in [[light water reactor]] cores.  Accordingly UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; produced from natural uranium sources must be enriched to a higher concentration of the fissionable isotope before being used as nuclear fuel in such reactors. The level of enrichment for a particular nuclear fuel order is specified by the customer according to the application they will use it for: light-water reactor fuel normally is enriched to 3.5% U-235, but uranium enriched to lower concentrations is also required. Enrichment is accomplished using any of several methods of [[isotope separation]]. [[Gaseous diffusion]] and [[gas centrifuge]] are the commonly used uranium enrichment methods, but new enrichment technologies are currently being developed.

The bulk (96%) of the byproduct from enrichment is [[depleted uranium]] (DU), which can be used for [[armor]], [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s, [[radiation shielding]] and [[Sailing ballast|ballast]]. As of 2008 there are vast quantities of depleted uranium in storage. The [[United States Department of Energy]] alone has 470,000 [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq16.cfm |title= How much depleted uranium hexafluoride is stored in the United States? |work= Depleted UF6 Management Information Network |accessdate= 2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 95% of depleted uranium is stored as [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Fabrication===
{{Main|Nuclear fuel}}
For use as nuclear fuel, enriched uranium hexafluoride is converted into [[uranium dioxide]] (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) powder that is then processed into pellet form. The pellets are then fired in a high temperature [[sintering]] [[furnace]] to create hard, [[ceramic]] pellets of [[enriched uranium]]. The cylindrical pellets then undergo a grinding process to achieve a uniform pellet size. The pellets are stacked, according to each [[nuclear reactor core]]'s design specifications, into tubes of corrosion-resistant metal [[alloy]]. The tubes are sealed to contain the fuel pellets: these tubes are called fuel rods. The finished fuel rods are grouped in special fuel assemblies that are then used to build up the nuclear fuel core of a power reactor.

The alloy used for the tubes depends on the design of the reactor. [[Stainless steel]] was used in the past, but most reactors now use a [[zirconium alloy]]. For the most common types of reactors, [[boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) and [[pressurized water reactor]]s (PWR), the tubes are assembled into bundles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pplweb.com/NR/rdonlyres/F63D7386-A57E-46C6-90A5-857D513B0254/0/seic_plantguide.pdf |format= PDF |title= Susquehanna Nuclear Energy Guide |publisher= PPL Corporation |accessdate= 2008-01-15 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071129121008/http://www.pplweb.com/NR/rdonlyres/F63D7386-A57E-46C6-90A5-857D513B0254/0/seic_plantguide.pdf |archivedate= 2007-11-29 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the tubes spaced precise distances apart. These bundles are then given a unique identification number, which enables them to be tracked from manufacture through use and into disposal.

==Service period==

===Transport of radioactive materials===
[[Transport]] is an integral part of the nuclear fuel cycle. There are nuclear power reactors in operation in several countries but uranium mining is viable in only a few areas. Also, in the course of over forty years of operation by the nuclear industry, a number of specialized facilities have been developed in various locations around the world to provide fuel cycle services and there is a need to transport nuclear materials to and from these facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnti.co.uk/media-centre/nuclear-fuel-cycle.aspx |title=Nuclear Fuel Cycle &amp;#124; World Nuclear Transport Institute |publisher=Wnti.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most transports of [[nuclear fuel]] material occur between different stages of the cycle, but occasionally a material may be transported between similar facilities. With some exceptions, nuclear fuel cycle materials are transported in solid form, the exception being [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) which is considered a gas. Most of the material used in nuclear fuel is transported several times during the cycle. Transports are frequently international, and are often over large distances. Nuclear materials are generally transported by specialized transport companies.

Since nuclear materials are [[radioactive]], it is important to ensure that radiation exposure of those involved in the transport of such materials and of the general public along transport routes is limited. Packaging for nuclear materials includes, where appropriate, [[radiation shielding|shielding]] to reduce potential radiation exposures. In the case of some materials, such as fresh uranium fuel assemblies, the radiation levels are negligible and no shielding is required. Other materials, such as spent fuel and high-level waste, are highly radioactive and require special handling. To limit the risk in transporting highly radioactive materials, containers known as [[spent nuclear fuel shipping cask]]s are used which are designed to maintain integrity under normal transportation conditions and during hypothetical accident conditions.

===In-core fuel management===
A [[nuclear reactor core]] is composed of a few hundred "assemblies", arranged in a regular array of cells, each cell being formed by a fuel or control rod surrounded, in most designs, by a [[neutron moderator|moderator]] and [[coolant]], which is water in most reactors.

Because of the [[nuclear fission|fission]] process that consumes the fuels, the old fuel rods must be replaced periodically with fresh ones (this is called a (replacement) cycle). During a given replacement cycle only some of the assemblies (typically one-third) are replaced since fuel depletion occurs at different rates at different places within the reactor core. Furthermore, for efficiency reasons, it is not a good policy to put the new assemblies exactly at the location of the removed ones. Even bundles of the same age will have different burn-up levels due to their previous positions in the core. Thus the available bundles must be arranged in such a way that the yield is maximized, while safety limitations and operational constraints are satisfied. Consequently, reactor operators are faced with the so-called '''optimal fuel reloading problem''', which consists of optimizing the rearrangement of all the assemblies, the old and fresh ones, while still maximizing the reactivity of the reactor core so as to maximise fuel burn-up and minimise fuel-cycle costs.

This is a [[discrete optimization]] problem, and computationally infeasible by current [[combinatorial]] methods, due to the huge number of [[permutation]]s and the complexity of each computation. Many [[numerical method]]s have been proposed for solving it and many commercial [[software]] packages have been written to support fuel management. This is an ongoing issue in reactor operations as no definitive solution to this problem has been found. Operators use a combination of [[computation]]al and [[empirical]] techniques to manage this problem.

====The study of used fuel====
{{Main|Post irradiation examination}}
Used nuclear fuel is studied in [[Post irradiation examination]], where used fuel is examined to know more about the processes that occur in fuel during use, and how these might alter the outcome of an accident. For example, during normal use, the fuel expands due to thermal expansion, which can cause cracking. Most [[nuclear fuel]] is uranium dioxide, which is a [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] solid with a structure similar to that of [[calcium fluoride]]. In used fuel the solid state structure of most of the solid remains the same as that of pure cubic uranium dioxide. SIMFUEL is the name given to the simulated spent fuel which is made by mixing finely ground metal oxides, grinding as a slurry, spray drying it before heating in hydrogen/argon to 1700 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.&lt;ref&gt;A good report on the microstructure of used fuel is Lucuta PG ''et al.'' (1991) ''J Nuclear Materials'' '''178''':48-60&lt;/ref&gt; In SIMFUEL, 4.1% of the volume of the solid was in the form of metal [[nanoparticle]]s which are made of [[molybdenum]], [[ruthenium]], [[rhodium]] and [[palladium]]. Most of these metal particles are of the ε phase ([[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]]) of Mo-Ru-Rh-Pd alloy, while smaller amounts of the α ([[Cubic crystal system|cubic]]) and σ ([[Tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]]) phases of these metals were found in the SIMFUEL. Also present within the SIMFUEL was a cubic [[perovskite]] phase which is a [[barium]] [[strontium]] [[zirconium|zirconate]] (Ba&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;ZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

Uranium dioxide is very insoluble in water, but after oxidation it can be converted to uranium trioxide or another uranium(VI) compound which is much more soluble. Uranium dioxide (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be oxidised to an oxygen rich hyperstoichiometric oxide (UO&lt;sub&gt;2+x&lt;/sub&gt;) which can be further oxidised to U&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and UO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

Because used fuel contains alpha emitters (plutonium and the [[minor actinides]]), the effect of adding an alpha emitter (&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu) to uranium dioxide on the leaching rate of the oxide has been investigated. For the crushed oxide, adding &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu tended to increase the rate of leaching, but the difference in the leaching rate between 0.1 and 10% &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu was very small.&lt;ref&gt;V.V. Rondinella VV ''et al.'' (2000) ''Radiochimica Acta'' '''88''':527-531&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration of [[carbonate]] in the water which is in contact with the used fuel has a considerable effect on the rate of corrosion, because [[uranium]](VI) forms soluble anionic carbonate complexes such as [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;. When carbonate ions are absent, and the water is not strongly acidic, the hexavalent uranium compounds which form on oxidation of [[uranium dioxide]] often form insoluble hydrated [[uranium trioxide]] phases.&lt;ref&gt;For a review of the corrosion of uranium dioxide in a waste store which explains much of the chemistry, see Shoesmith DW (2000) ''J Nuclear Materials'' '''282''':1-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Thin films of uranium dioxide can be deposited upon gold surfaces by ‘[[sputtering]]’ using uranium metal and an [[argon]]/[[oxygen]] gas mixture. These gold surfaces modified with uranium dioxide have been used for both [[cyclic voltammetry]] and [[AC impedance]] experiments, and these offer an insight into the likely leaching behaviour of uranium dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;Miserque F ''et al.'' (2001) ''J Nuclear Materials'' '''298''':280-90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fuel cladding interactions====
The study of the nuclear fuel cycle includes the study of the behaviour of nuclear materials both under normal conditions and under accident conditions. For example, there has been much work on how [[uranium dioxide]] based fuel interacts with the [[zirconium]] alloy tubing used to cover it. During use, the fuel swells due to [[thermal expansion]] and then starts to react with the surface of the zirconium alloy, forming a new layer which contains both fuel and zirconium (from the cladding). Then, on the fuel side of this mixed layer, there is a layer of fuel which has a higher [[caesium]] to [[uranium]] ratio than most of the fuel. This is because [[xenon]] isotopes are formed as [[fission products]] that diffuse out of the lattice of the fuel into voids such as the narrow gap between the fuel and the cladding. After diffusing into these voids, it decays to caesium isotopes. Because of the thermal gradient which exists in the fuel during use, the volatile fission products tend to be driven from the centre of the pellet to the rim area.&lt;ref&gt;Further reading on fuel cladding interactions: Tanaka K ''et al.'' (2006) ''J Nuclear Materials'' '''357''':58-68&lt;/ref&gt; Below is a graph of the temperature of uranium metal, uranium nitride and [[uranium dioxide]] as a function of distance from the centre of a 20&amp;nbsp;mm diameter pellet with a rim temperature of 200 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C. The uranium dioxide (because of its poor thermal conductivity) will overheat at the centre of the pellet, while the other more thermally conductive forms of uranium remain below their melting points.

[[File:Rim200pd1000rad1000fueltemp.png|center|thumb|450px|Temperature profile for a 20&amp;nbsp;mm diameter fuel pellet with a power density of 1 kW per cubic meter. The fuels other than uranium dioxide are not compromised.]]

====Normal and abnormal conditions====

The nuclear chemistry associated with the nuclear fuel cycle can be divided into two main areas; one area is concerned with operation under the intended conditions while the other area is concerned with maloperation conditions where some alteration from the normal operating conditions has occurred or (''more rarely'') an accident is occurring.

The releases of radioactivity from normal operations are the small planned releases from uranium ore processing, enrichment, power reactors, reprocessing plants and waste stores. These can be in different chemical/physical form from releases which could occur under accident conditions. In addition the isotope signature of a hypothetical accident may be very different from that of a planned normal operational discharge of radioactivity to the environment.

Just because a radioisotope is released it does not mean it will enter a human and then cause harm. For instance, the migration of radioactivity can be altered by the binding of the radioisotope to the surfaces of soil particles. For example, [[caesium]] (Cs) binds tightly to clay minerals such as [[illite]] and [[montmorillonite]], hence it remains in the upper layers of soil where it can be accessed by plants with shallow roots (such as grass). Hence grass and mushrooms can carry a considerable amount of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs which can be transferred to humans through the food chain. But &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is not able to migrate quickly through most soils and thus is unlikely to contaminate [[Water well|well]] water. Colloids of soil minerals can migrate through soil so simple binding of a metal to the surfaces of soil particles does not completely fix the metal.

According to Jiří Hála's [[text book]], the distribution coefficient K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is the ratio of the soil's radioactivity (Bq g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) to that of the soil water (Bq ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). If the radioisotope is tightly bound to the minerals in the soil, then less radioactivity can be absorbed by crops and [[grass]] growing on the soil.

* [[Cs-137]] K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 1000
* [[plutonium|Pu-239]] K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 10000 to 100000
* [[strontium|Sr-90]] K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 80 to 150
* [[Iodine|I-131]] K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.007 to 50

In dairy farming, one of the best countermeasures against &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is to mix up the soil by deeply ploughing the soil. This has the effect of putting the &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs out of reach of the shallow roots of the grass, hence the level of radioactivity in the grass will be lowered. Also after a nuclear war or serious accident, the removal of top few cm of soil and its burial in a shallow trench will reduce the long-term gamma dose to humans due to &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs, as the gamma photons will be attenuated by their passage through the soil.

Even after the radioactive element arrives at the roots of the plant, the metal may be rejected by the biochemistry of the plant. The details of the uptake of &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr and &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs into [[sunflower]]s grown under [[hydroponic]] conditions has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;P. Soudek, Š. Valenová, Z. Vavříková and T. Vaněk, ''Journal of Environmental Radioactivity'', 2006, '''88''', 236-250&lt;/ref&gt; The caesium was found in the leaf veins, in the stem and in the [[Apical meristem|apical]] leaves. It was found that 12% of the caesium entered the plant, and 20% of the strontium. This paper also reports details of the effect of [[potassium]], [[ammonium]] and [[calcium]] ions on the uptake of the radioisotopes.

In [[livestock]] farming, an important countermeasure against &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is to feed animals a small amount of [[Prussian blue]]. This [[iron]] potassium [[cyanide]] compound acts as an [[ion-exchanger]]. The cyanide is so tightly bonded to the iron that it is safe for a human to eat several grams of Prussian blue per day. The Prussian blue reduces the [[biological half-life]] (different from the [[half-life|nuclear half-life]]) of the caesium. The physical or nuclear half-life of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is about 30 years. This is a constant which can not be changed but the biological half-life is not a constant. It will change according to the nature and habits of the organism for which it is expressed. Caesium in humans normally has a biological half-life of between one and four months. An added advantage of the Prussian blue is that the caesium which is stripped from the animal in the [[feces|droppings]] is in a form which is not available to plants. Hence it prevents the caesium from being recycled. The form of Prussian blue required for the treatment of humans or animals is a special grade. Attempts to use the [[pigment]] grade used in [[paint]]s have not been successful. Note that a good{{According to whom|date=July 2012}} source of data on the subject of caesium in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] fallout exists at [http://www.uiar.org.ua/Eng/index.htm] (''Ukrainian Research Institute for Agricultural Radiology'').

=====Release of radioactivity from fuel during normal use and accidents=====

The IAEA assume that under normal operation the coolant of a water-cooled reactor will contain some radioactivity&lt;ref&gt;page 169 Generic Assessment Procedures for Determining Protective Actions During a Reactor Accident, IAEA-TECDOC-955, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; but during a reactor accident the coolant radioactivity level may rise. The IAEA states that under a series of different conditions different amounts of the core inventory can be released from the fuel, the four conditions the IAEA consider are ''normal operation'', a spike in coolant activity due to a sudden shutdown/loss of pressure (core remains covered with water), a cladding failure resulting in the release of the activity in the fuel/cladding gap (this could be due to the fuel being uncovered by the loss of water for 15–30 minutes where the cladding reached a temperature of 650-1250 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C) or a melting of the core (the fuel will have to be uncovered for at least 30 minutes, and the cladding would reach a temperature in excess of 1650 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C).&lt;ref&gt;page 173 Generic Assessment Procedures for Determining Protective Actions During a Reactor Accident, IAEA-TECDOC-955, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Based upon the assumption that a Pressurized water reactor contains 300 tons of [[water]], and that the activity of the fuel of a 1 GWe reactor is as the IAEA predicts,&lt;ref&gt;page 171 Generic Assessment Procedures for Determining Protective Actions During a Reactor Accident, IAEA-TECDOC-955, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; then the coolant activity after an accident such as the [[Three Mile Island accident]] (where a core is uncovered and then recovered with water) can be predicted.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=====Releases from reprocessing under normal conditions=====

It is normal to allow used fuel to stand after the irradiation to allow the short-lived and radiotoxic [[iodine]] isotopes to decay away. In one experiment in the USA, fresh fuel which had not been allowed to decay was reprocessed (the [[Green run]] [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=7296321] [http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/381/3733.html] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060508030806/http://archive.tri-cityherald.com/thyroid/history.html]) to investigate the effects of a large iodine release from the reprocessing of short cooled fuel. It is normal in reprocessing plants to scrub the off gases from the dissolver to prevent the emission of iodine. In addition to the emission of iodine the [[noble gas]]es and [[tritium]] are released from the fuel when it is dissolved. It has been proposed that by voloxidation (heating the fuel in a furnace under oxidizing conditions) the majority of the tritium can be recovered from the fuel.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060307211536/http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/pres/123514.pdf]

A paper was written on the radioactivity in [[oyster]]s found in the [[Irish Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Preston, J.W.R. Dutton and B.R. Harvey, ''Nature'', 1968, '''218''', 689-690.&lt;/ref&gt; These were found by gamma spectroscopy to contain &lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt;Ce, &lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Ce, &lt;sup&gt;103&lt;/sup&gt;Ru, &lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Ru, &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs, &lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Zr and &lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Nb. Additionally, a zinc activation product (&lt;sup&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt;Zn) was found, which is thought to be due to the corrosion of [[magnox]] fuel cladding in [[spent fuel pool]]s. It is likely that the modern releases of all these isotopes from the [[Sellafield|Windscale]] event is smaller.

===On-load reactors===
Some reactor designs, such as [[RBMK]]s or [[CANDU reactor]]s, can be refueled without being shut down. This is achieved through the use of many small pressure tubes to contain the fuel and coolant, as opposed to one large pressure vessel as in [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) or [[boiling water reactor]] (BWR) designs. Each tube can be individually isolated and refueled by an operator-controlled fueling machine, typically at a rate of up to 8 channels per day out of roughly 400 in CANDU reactors. On-load refueling allows for the '''optimal fuel reloading problem''' to be dealt with continuously, leading to more efficient use of fuel. This increase in efficiency is partially offset by the added complexity of having hundreds of pressure tubes and the fueling machines to service them.

===Interim storage===
After its operating cycle, the reactor is shut down for refueling. The fuel discharged at that time (spent fuel) is stored either at the reactor site (commonly in a [[spent fuel pool]]) or potentially in a common facility away from reactor sites. If on-site pool storage capacity is exceeded, it may be desirable to store the now cooled aged fuel in modular dry storage facilities known as Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSI) at the reactor site or at a facility away from the site. The spent fuel rods are usually stored in water or boric acid, which provides both cooling (the spent fuel continues to generate [[decay heat]] as a result of residual radioactive decay) and shielding to protect the environment from residual [[ionizing radiation]], although after at least a year of cooling they may be moved to [[dry cask storage]].

===Transportation===
{{Main|Spent nuclear fuel shipping cask}}

===Reprocessing===
{{Main|Nuclear reprocessing}}
{{See also|Spent nuclear fuel}}


Spent fuel discharged from reactors contains appreciable quantities of fissile (U-235 and Pu-239), fertile (U-238), and other [[radioactive]] materials, including [[nuclear poison|reaction poisons]], which is why the fuel had to be removed. These fissile and fertile materials can be chemically separated and recovered from the spent fuel. The recovered uranium and plutonium can, if economic and institutional conditions permit, be recycled for use as nuclear fuel. This is currently not done for civilian spent nuclear fuel in the [[United States]].

Mixed oxide, or [[MOX fuel]], is a blend of [[reprocessed uranium]] and plutonium and depleted uranium which behaves similarly, although not identically, to the enriched uranium feed for which most nuclear reactors were designed. MOX fuel is an alternative to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel used in the light water reactors which predominate nuclear power generation.

Currently, plants in Europe are reprocessing spent fuel from utilities in Europe and Japan. Reprocessing of spent commercial-reactor nuclear fuel is currently not permitted in the [[United States]] due to the perceived danger of [[nuclear proliferation]]. However, the recently announced [[Global Nuclear Energy Partnership]] would see the U.S. form an international partnership to see spent nuclear fuel reprocessed in a way that renders the plutonium in it usable for nuclear fuel but not for [[nuclear weapon]]s.

===Partitioning and transmutation===
As an alternative to the disposal of the [[PUREX raffinate]] in [[glass]] or [[Synroc]] matrix, the most [[radiotoxic]] elements could be removed through advanced reprocessing. After separation, the [[minor actinides]] and some long-lived [[fission product]]s could be converted to short-lived or stable [[isotope]]s by either [[neutron]] or [[photon]] irradiation. This is called [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]]. However, a strong and long-term international cooperation, many decades of research and huge investments remain necessary before to reach a mature industrial scale where the safety and the economical feasibility of partitioning and transmutation (P&amp;T) could be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Waste disposal===
{{actinidesvsfissionproducts}}
{{Main|Radioactive waste|Spent nuclear fuel}}
A current concern in the nuclear power field is the safe disposal and isolation of either [[Spent nuclear fuel|spent fuel from reactors]] or, if the reprocessing option is used, wastes from reprocessing plants. These materials must be isolated from the [[biosphere]] until the radioactivity contained in them has diminished to a safe level.&lt;ref&gt;M. I. Ojovan, W.E. Lee. An Introduction to Nuclear Waste Immobilisation, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., {{ISBN|0-08-044462-8}}, Amsterdam, 315pp. (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., under the [[Nuclear Waste Policy Act]] of 1982 as amended, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] has responsibility for the development of the waste disposal system for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. Current plans call for the ultimate disposal of the wastes in solid form in a licensed deep, stable geologic structure called a [[deep geological repository]]. The Department of Energy chose [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Yucca Mountain]] as the location for the repository. However, its opening has been repeatedly delayed. Since 1999 thousands of nuclear waste shipments have been stored at the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant]] in New Mexico.

[[Fast-neutron reactor]]s can fission all actinides, while the [[thorium fuel cycle]] produces low levels of [[transuranic]]s. Unlike LWRs, in principle these fuel cycles could recycle their [[plutonium]] and [[minor actinides]] and leave only [[fission product]]s and [[activation product]]s as waste. The highly radioactive [[medium-lived fission product]]s [[Cs-137]] and [[Sr-90]] diminish by a factor of 10 each century; while the [[long-lived fission product]]s have relatively low radioactivity, often compared favorably to that of the original uranium ore.

==Fuel cycles==
Although the most common terminology is ''fuel cycle,'' some argue that the term ''fuel chain'' is more accurate, because the spent fuel is never fully recycled. Spent fuel includes [[fission products]], which generally must be treated as [[radioactive waste|waste]], as well as uranium, plutonium, and other transuranic elements. Where plutonium is recycled, it is normally reused once in light water reactors, although fast reactors could lead to more complete recycling of plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Energy and the New Reality 2: Carbon-Free Energy Supply- section 8.4 |author=Harvey, L.D.D.|isbn=9781849710732|year=2010|publisher=Earthscan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Once-through nuclear fuel cycle===
[[Image:Oncethroughcycle.png|500px|thumb|right|A once through (or open) fuel cycle]]
Not a cycle ''per se'', fuel is used once and then sent to storage without further processing save additional packaging to provide for better isolation from the [[biosphere]]. This method is favored by six countries: the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Spain]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull401/article6.html |title= Management of Spent Fuel at Nuclear Power Plants |work= IAEA Bulletin |accessdate= 2008-01-15 |author1= Dyck, Peter |author2= Crijns, Martin J. |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071210032159/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull401/article6.html |archivedate= 2007-12-10 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries, notably Finland, Sweden and Canada, have designed repositories to permit future recovery of the material should the need arise, while others plan for permanent sequestration in a [[geological repository]] like the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] in the United States.

===Plutonium cycle===
{{See also|Nuclear power proposed as renewable_energy#Fuel supply}}
[[Image:Plutrecyclefuelcycle.png|500px|thumb|right|A fuel cycle in which plutonium is used for fuel]]
[[File:Ifr concept.jpg|thumb|375px|The [[integral fast reactor]] concept (color), with the reactor above and integrated [[pyroprocessing]] fuel cycle below.

Uploaded by - Nuclear Engineering at Argonne}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:IFR concept.png|thumb|375px|IFR concept (Black and White with clearer text)]]
Several countries, including Japan, Switzerland, and previously Spain and Germany,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} are using or have used the [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] services offered by [[BNFL]] and [[Areva NC|COGEMA]]. Here, the [[fission product]]s, [[minor actinides]], [[activation product]]s, and [[reprocessed uranium]] are separated from the reactor-grade [[plutonium]], which can then be fabricated into [[MOX fuel]]. Because the proportion of the non-[[fissile]] [[even and odd numbers|even]]-[[atomic mass|mass]] [[isotopes of plutonium]] rises with each pass through the cycle, there are currently no plans to reuse plutonium from used MOX fuel for a third pass in a [[thermal reactor]]. However, if [[fast reactor]]s become available, they may be able to burn these, or almost any other [[actinide]] [[isotope]]s.

The use of a medium-scale [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] facility onsite, and the use of [[pyroprocessing]] rather than the present day aqueous reprocessing, is claimed to considerably reduce the [[Nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] potential or possible diversion of fissile material as the processing facility is [[in-situ]]/integral. Similarly as plutonium is not separated on its own in the pyroprocessing cycle, rather all actinides are "[[electrowinning|electro-won]]" or "refined" from the spent fuel, the plutonium is never separated on its own, instead it comes over into the new fuel mixed with gamma and alpha emitting actinides, species that "self-protect" it in numerous possible thief scenarios.

===Minor actinides recycling===
It has been proposed that in addition to the use of plutonium, the [[minor actinide]]s could be used in a critical power reactor. Tests are already being conducted in which [[americium]] is being used as a fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nea.fr/html/pt/docs/iem/jeju02/session3/SessionIII-04.pdf |format= PDF |title= The Preparation of the EFTTRA-T5 Americium Transmutation Experiment |work= Seventh Information Exchange Meeting on Actinide and Fission Product Partitioning and Transmutation |author1=Warin D. |author2=Konings R.J.M |author3=Haas D. |author4=Maritin P. |author5=Bonnerot J-M. |author6=Vambenepe G. |author7=Schram R.P.C. |author8=Kuijper J.C. |author9=Bakker K. |author10=Conrad R. |accessdate= 2008-01-15 |date=October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of reactor designs, like the [[Integral Fast Reactor]], have been designed for this rather different fuel cycle. In principle, it should be possible to derive energy from the fission of any actinide nucleus. With a careful reactor design, all the actinides in the fuel can be consumed, leaving only lighter elements with short [[half-life|half-lives]]. Whereas this has been done in prototype plants, no such reactor has ever been operated on a large scale.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

It so happens that the [[neutron cross-section]] of many actinides decreases with increasing neutron energy, but the ratio of fission to simple activation ([[neutron capture]]) changes in favour of fission as the neutron energy increases. Thus with a sufficiently high neutron energy, it should be possible to destroy even curium without the generation of the transcurium metals. This could be very desirable as it would make it significantly easier to reprocess and handle the actinide fuel.

One promising alternative from this perspective is an [[accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor]] / [[subcritical reactor]]. Here a beam of either [[proton]]s (United States and European designs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.neutron.kth.se/publications/conference_papers/W_Gudowski_FR202_1.PDF |title= Why Accelerator-Driven Transmutation of Wastes Enables Future Nuclear Power? |last= Gudowski |first= W. |accessdate= 2008-01-15 |work= XX International Linac Conference |date= August 2000 |format= PDF |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071129121009/http://www.neutron.kth.se/publications/conference_papers/W_Gudowski_FR202_1.PDF |archivedate= 2007-11-29 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=10165253 |title= An overview of accelerator-driven transmutation technology| date= 1994-08-01 |last= Heighway |first= E.

In the case of protons, very fast neutrons will spall off the target, while in the case of the electrons, very high energy [[photon]]s will be generated. These high-energy neutrons and photons will then be able to cause the fission of the heavy actinides.

Such reactors compare very well to other neutron sources in terms of neutron energy:

* Thermal 0 to 100&amp;nbsp;eV
* Epithermal 100&amp;nbsp;eV to 100&amp;nbsp;keV
* Fast (from [[nuclear fission]]) 100&amp;nbsp;keV to 3&amp;nbsp;MeV
* DD [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] 2.5&amp;nbsp;MeV
* DT fusion 14&amp;nbsp;MeV

As an alternative, the curium-244, with a half-life of 18 years, could be left to decay into plutonium-240 before being used in fuel in a fast reactor.

[[Image:Twincyclefuelcycle.png|thumb|center|853px|A pair of fuel cycles in which uranium and plutonium are kept separate from the minor actinides. The minor actinide cycle is kept within the green box.]]

====Fuel or targets for this actinide transmutation====
To date the nature of the fuel (targets) for actinide transformation has not been chosen.

If actinides are transmuted in a [[Subcritical reactor]], it is likely that the fuel will have to be able to tolerate more thermal cycles than conventional fuel. An accelerator-driven sub-critical reactor is unlikely to be able to maintain a constant operation period for equally long times as a critical reactor, and each time the accelerator stops then the fuel will cool down.

On the other hand, if actinides are destroyed using a fast reactor, such as an [[Integral Fast Reactor]], then the fuel will most likely not be exposed to many more thermal cycles than in a normal power station.

Depending on the matrix the process can generate more transuranics from the matrix. This could either be viewed as good (generate more fuel) or can be viewed as bad (generation of more ''radiotoxic'' [[transuranic element]]s). A series of different matrices exists which can control this production of heavy actinides.

Fissile nuclei, like Uranium-235, Plutonium-239 and Uranium-233 respond well to [[delayed neutrons]] and are thus important to keep a critical reactor stable, and this limits the amount of minor actinides that can be destroyed in a critical reactor. As a consequence, it is important that the chosen matrix allows the reactor to keep the ratio of fissile to non-fissile nuclei high, as this enables it to destroy the long-lived actinides safely. In contrast, the power output of a sub-critical reactor is limited by the intensity of the driving particle accelerator, and thus it need not contain any uranium or plutonium at all. In such a system, it may be preferable to have an inert matrix that doesn't produce additional long-lived isotopes.

=====Actinides in an inert matrix=====
The actinides will be mixed with a metal which will not form more actinides, for instance an [[alloy]] of actinides in a solid such as [[zirconia]] could be used.

=====Actinides in a thorium matrix=====
[[Thorium]] will on neutron bombardment form [[uranium-233]]. U-233 is fissile, and has a larger fission cross section than both U-235 and U-238, and thus it is far less likely to produce higher actinides through neutron capture.

=====Actinides in a uranium matrix=====
If the actinides are incorporated into a uranium-metal or uranium-oxide matrix, then the neutron capture of U-238 is likely to generate new [[plutonium-239]]. An advantage of mixing the actinides with uranium and plutonium is that the large fission cross sections of U-235 and Pu-239 for the less energetic [[delayed-neutrons]] could make the reaction stable enough to be carried out in a critical [[fast reactor]], which is likely to be both cheaper and simpler than an accelerator driven system.

=====Mixed matrix=====
It is also possible to create a matrix made from a mix of the above-mentioned materials. This is most commonly done in fast reactors where one may wish to keep the breeding ratio of new fuel high enough to keep powering the reactor, but still low enough that the generated actinides can be safely destroyed without transporting them to another site. One way to do this is to use fuel where actinides and uranium is mixed with inert zirconium, producing fuel elements with the desired properties.

===Thorium cycle===
{{Main|Thorium fuel cycle}}
In the thorium fuel cycle [[thorium-232]] absorbs a [[neutron]] in either a fast or thermal reactor. The thorium-233 [[beta decay]]s to [[protactinium]]-233 and then to [[uranium-233]], which in turn is used as fuel. Hence, like [[uranium-238]], thorium-232 is a [[fertile material]].
:&lt;chem&gt;\overset{neutron}{n} + ^{232}_{90}Th -&gt; ^{233}_{90}Th -&gt;[\beta^-] ^{233}_{91}Pa -&gt;[\beta^-] \overset{fuel}{^{233}_{92}U}&lt;/chem&gt;
After starting the reactor with existing U-233 or some other [[fissile material]] such as [[Uranium-235|U-235]] or [[Pu-239]], a breeding cycle similar to but more efficient&lt;ref name="THFUELCYCLE"&gt;See [[thorium fuel cycle]]&lt;/ref&gt; than that with U-238 and plutonium can be created. The Th-232 absorbs a neutron to become Th-233 which quickly decays to [[protactinium]]-233. Protactinium-233 in turn decays with a half-life of 27 days to U-233. In some [[molten salt reactor]] designs, the Pa-233 is extracted and protected from neutrons (which could transform it to Pa-234 and then to [[Uranium-234|U-234]]), until it has decayed to U-233. This is done in order to improve the [[breeder reactor#Breeding ratio|breeding ratio]] which is low compared to [[fast reactor]]s.

[[Thorium]] is at least 4-5 times more abundant in nature than all of uranium isotopes combined; thorium is fairly evenly spread around Earth with a lot of countries&lt;ref&gt;See [[Thorium#Occurrence|Thorium occurrence]] for discussion of abundance.&lt;/ref&gt;
having huge supplies of it; preparation of thorium fuel does not require difficult
&lt;ref name="THFUELCYCLE" /&gt;
and expensive enrichment processes; the thorium fuel cycle creates mainly Uranium-233 contaminated with [[Uranium-232]] which makes it harder to use in a normal, pre-assembled nuclear weapon which is stable over long periods of time (unfortunately drawbacks are much lower for immediate use weapons or where final assembly occurs just prior to usage time); elimination of at least the [[transuranic]] portion of the nuclear waste problem is possible in [[Molten-salt reactor|MSR]] and other breeder reactor designs.

One of the earliest efforts to use a thorium fuel cycle took place at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in the 1960s. An experimental reactor was built based on [[molten salt reactor]] technology to study the feasibility of such an approach, using [[thorium fluoride]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] kept hot enough to be liquid, thus eliminating the need for fabricating fuel elements.  This effort culminated in the [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment]] that used &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th as the fertile material and &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U as the fissile fuel. Due to a lack of funding, the MSR program was discontinued in 1976.

===Current industrial activity===
Currently the only isotopes used as nuclear fuel are [[uranium-235]] (U-235), [[uranium-238]] (U-238) and [[plutonium-239]], although the proposed thorium fuel cycle has advantages. Some modern reactors, with minor modifications, can use [[thorium]]. Thorium is approximately three times more abundant in the [[crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] than uranium (and 550 times more abundant than uranium-235). However, there has been little exploration for thorium resources, and thus the [[proved resource]] is small. [[Thorium]] is more plentiful than [[uranium]] in some countries, notably [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.npcil.nic.in/nupower_vol11_1-3/chidambaram.htm |title= Towards an Energy Independent India |year= 1997 | author=  Chidambaram R. |work= Nu-Power |publisher= Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited |accessdate= 2008-01-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217050844/http://www.npcil.nic.in/nupower_vol11_1-3/chidambaram.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heavy water reactor]]s and graphite-moderated reactors can use [[natural uranium]], but the vast majority of the world's reactors require [[enriched uranium]], in which the ratio of U-235 to U-238 is increased. In civilian reactors, the enrichment is increased to 3-5% U-235 and 95% U-238, but in [[nuclear marine propulsion|naval reactors]] there is as much as 93% U-235.

The term ''[[nuclear fuel]]'' is not normally used in respect to [[fusion power]], which fuses [[isotope]]s of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]] to release [[energy]].

'''Pak Elektron Limited''' (PEL) is a [[Pakistan]]i [[engineering]] [[corporation]] which manufactures [[major appliance|major home appliance]]s and [[electrical equipment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/948427/corporate-results-pak-elektrons-earnings-increase-84/|title=Corporate results: Pak Elektron’s earnings increase 84%  - The Express Tribune|date=2015-09-01|newspaper=The Express Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PEL was founded in 1956 through technical collaboration with [[AEG]]. In 1978, PEL was acquired by [[Saigol Group]] and was taken public a decade later. Over the years, PEL has formed alliances with several international giants, including [[General Electric]], [[Fujitsu]] and [[Hitachi]]. The company also became the sole distributor of [[LG Corporation]]'s home appliances in 2009. PEL operates in two segments - power and appliances. The former includes manufacturing of transformers, grid stations and energy meters among other goods, while the latter division deals in making, assembling and distribution of home appliances like refrigerators and [[Air conditioner inverter|air conditioner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brecorder.com/company-news/235/1238501/|title=Pak Elektron Limited {{!}} Business Recorder|last=Recorder|first=Business|website=Business Recorder|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/950922/pak-elektron-a-story-of-recovery-after-years-of-frozen-growth/|title=A story of recovery after years of frozen growth - The Express Tribune|date=2015-09-05|newspaper=The Express Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appliances Division==
PEL’s Appliances Division is the flag carrier of the Saigol Group involved in home appliances manufacturing.

===PEL Air Conditioners===
PEL window-type air conditioners were introduced in 1981 in technical collaboration with General Corporation of [[Japan]]. Ever since their launch, PEL air conditioners have a leading position in the market. Recognizing the shift in consumers' preference from window-type to split-type air conditioners, PEL has focused its manufacturing efforts on split-type air conditioners.

===PEL Refrigerators===
The manufacturing of [[refrigerators]] started in 1986-87 in technical collaboration with M/s IAR-SILTAL of [[Italy]]. Like air conditioners, PEL's refrigerators are also in great demand. Today, PEL Crystal has 30% market share across Pakistan.

'''Samuel Garbett''' (1717– 5 December 1803&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;R. H. Campbell, ‘Garbett, Samuel (1717–1803)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40491, accessed 29 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a prominent citizen of [[Birmingham]] England, during the [[industrial revolution]], and a friend of [[Matthew Boulton]]. Historian [[Carl Chinn]] argues&lt;ref name="Chinn"&gt;{{Cite journal

{{Quote|stood alongside Boulton as one of the key figures responsible for Birmingham's rapid expansion into one of the world's leading industrial towns.}}

Garbett's education extended:

{{Quote|[no] further than writing and accounts; but he was a man of great acuteness of genius and extent of understanding.&lt;ref name="Carlyle"&gt;[[Alexander Carlyle]], autobiography, cited by Chinn&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Garbett was employed by a London merchant named Hollis, as his agent for purchasing goods in Birmingham.&lt;ref name="Chinn" /&gt; In that role, he came:

{{Quote|into notice and rank among his townsmen; and the more he was known, the more he was esteemed.&lt;ref name="Carlyle" /&gt;}}

He married Anne Clay (d. 1772) of [[Aston]] in August 1735.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

He then made his fortune as a merchant in his own right, before entering partnership with Dr [[John Roebuck]] to set up a laboratory in Steelhouse Lane where [[precious metal]]s were refined and [[assay]]ed; a manufacturing centre for [[sulphuric acid]] in [[Prestonpans]] in 1749; and, with others, the [[Carron Iron Works]], in Scotland, in 1760,&lt;ref name="Chinn" /&gt; in which the two Birmingham men each held a 25% share.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; He also chaired, from January 1788, a Birmingham committee against the [[slave trade]].&lt;ref name="Chinn" /&gt;

His eldest child and only daughter Mary married [[Charles Gascoigne]] in 1759, and in 1765 Gascoigne became a partner in the Carron works, having been manager of Garbett's nearby [[turpentine]] factory, Garbett &amp; Co., since 1763.

Garbett was involved in the creation of [[Birmingham Assay Office]] in 1773,&lt;ref name="Chinn" /&gt; and was the first chairman of Birmingham's Commercial Committee, forerunner of successive [[British Chambers of Commerce|Birmingham Chambers of Commerce]],&lt;ref name="Chinn" /&gt; as was a member of the committee that raised funds to create [[Birmingham General Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Chinn" /&gt;

He was declared[[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] in 1782.&lt;ref name="Chinn" /&gt; Boulton encouraged him to re-establish his business in Birmingham, which he did successfully.&lt;ref name="Chinn" /&gt;

At his death in 1803, his estate was over £12,000, albeit with some creditors not discharged.&lt;ref name="Chinn" /&gt; He was buried at [[St Philip's Cathedral, Birmingham|St Philip's Church]] (later Birmingham's cathedral), where he had been a [[church warden]].&lt;ref name="Chinn" /&gt; Matthew Boulton wrote of him:

{{Quote|I have always found his principles unfailingly just, honourable and liberal.&lt;ref&gt;M. Boulton to W. Davies, 12 Dec 1803; Matthew Boulton MSS&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout his life, Garbett played a prominent part in local politics and affairs, including police proposals and the development of [[Birmingham Canal Navigations|Birmingham's canals]].&lt;ref&gt;John Money, ''Experience and identity, Birmingham and the West Midlands 1760-1800'' (Manchester, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Priestley riots|Birmingham riots of 1791]], it was at his house in [[Newhall Street]] that the town and country gentry held their emergency meetings.&lt;ref&gt;TNA HO 42/19/109.&lt;/ref&gt;  His political lobbying in general, and correspondence with [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Shelburne]] in particular, make him a significant figure in national politics.&lt;ref&gt;John Money, ''op.cit.''; John Norris, ''Shelburne and reform'' (London, 1963); T M Norris, "Samuel Garbett and the early development of industrial lobbying in Great Britain," ''The Economic History Review'', 10(3) (1958), 450-460.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Magnus was born and raised in [[Belleville, Illinois]]. She earned degrees in [[physics]] and [[electrical engineering]] from the [[Missouri University of Science and Technology|University of Missouri–Rolla]] (now known as the Missouri University of Science and Technology) before earning a [[PhD]] in [[Materials science|materials science and engineering]] from the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in 1996.  Research for her [[dissertation]], entitled "An Investigation of the relationship between the [[thermochemistry]] and [[Thermionic emission|emission]] behavior of [[thermionic cathode]]s based on the BaO-Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ternary system," was supported by a fellowship from the [[Glenn Research Center|NASA Lewis Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/19625 |first=Sandra |last=Magnus  |title=An Investigation of the relationship between the thermochemistry and emission behavior of thermionic cathodes based on the BaO-Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ternary system |accessdate=2008-11-16 |work=SMARTech |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology |date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JSCbio" /&gt;

===Engineering career===
During the 1980s, Magnus worked on [[stealth aircraft]] design as an [[engineer]] for [[McDonnell Douglas]].  She worked on the propulsion system for the [[A-12 Avenger II]] until the project was canceled by the [[United States Navy|Navy]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="JSCbio" /&gt;

===NASA career===
[[File:Sandy Magnus in the Destiny Module.jpg|left|thumb|Sandra Magnus, STS-119 mission specialist, exercises on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation System (CEVIS) in the Destiny laboratory.]]

====STS-112====
Magnus was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1996 and flew her first space mission, [[STS-112]], in October 2002 as a mission specialist. The main objective of [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']]' mission was the installation of the S1 truss section on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) and consumables delivery. Magnus operated the space station's robotic arm during the three spacewalks required to install and activate the S1 truss. The flight duration was 10 days 19 hours 58 minutes and 44 seconds.

====Survival training====
From January 29–31, 2006, together with Oleg Artemiev and [[Michael Barratt (astronaut)|Michael Barratt]], Magnus took part in a two-day examination for the ability to survive in an uninhabited area in case of the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)#Reentry Module|Soyuz descent module]] making an emergency landing. She passed this examination in the forest near [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://suzymchale.com/ruspace/cosnews2006.html|title=Future cosmonauts learn to survive in freezing weather in the Moscow forests|author=|publisher=RuSpace|date=January 27, 2006|accessdate=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NEEMO 11====
From September 16–22, 2006, Magnus served as the commander of NASA's [[NEEMO#NEEMO 11: September 16–22, 2006|NEEMO 11]] mission, an undersea expedition at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s [[Aquarius (laboratory)|Aquarius laboratory]] located off the coast of [[Florida]].  With fellow astronaut/[[aquanaut]]s [[Timothy Kopra]], [[Robert Behnken]] and [[Timothy Creamer]], all of whom were training for possible assignment to missions to the International Space Station, Magnus imitated [[Moon landing|moonwalk]]s, tested concepts for mobility using various [[spacesuit]] configurations and weights to simulate lunar [[gravity]].  Techniques for communication, navigation, geological sample retrieval, construction and using remote-controlled [[robot]]s on the [[moon]]'s surface also were tested.  [[National Undersea Research Center]] support crew members Larry Ward and Roger Garcia provided [[engineering]] support inside the [[Underwater habitat|habitat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/NEEMO11/index.html|title=NASA - NEEMO 11|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expedition 18====
Magnus served as Flight Engineer on board the International Space Station as part of [[Expedition 18]].&lt;ref name="JSCbio"/&gt; Magnus was a Mission Specialist on [[STS-126]] for the trip to the station, which launched on November 14, 2008.&lt;ref name="sched"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |title=NASA's Shuttle and Rocket Missions |accessdate=2008-11-16 |date=2008-11-14 |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as Mission Specialist on [[STS-119]] when it returned on March 28, 2009.&lt;ref name="JSCbio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?id=19 |title=Cleared for Takeoff: Georgia Tech Graduate is Crewmember on Shuttle Mission to ISS |date=2002-08-06 |accessdate=2008-11-14 |work=News Room |publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520081117/http://www.gatech.edu/newsroom/release.html?id=19 |archivedate=2011-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She logged 133 days in orbit and received warm greetings from NASA on her return. Her replacement, [[JAXA]] astronaut [[Koichi Wakata]], was launched aboard ''Discovery'' on March 15, 2009.&lt;ref name="return" /&gt;

====STS-135====
[[File:STS-135 Sandy Magnus in the Cupola.jpg|right|thumb|Magnus in the [[Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola]] aboard the International Space Station during STS-135.]]
On September 14, 2010, NASA announced Magnus to be one of four astronauts assigned to the STS-135 "launch on need" crew that was, if needed, to fly a rescue mission for [[STS-134]], which was originally the last scheduled shuttle flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/sep/HQ_10-222_LON_Annc.html|title=NASA Assigns Crew for Final Launch on Need Shuttle Mission |author=NASA|date=September 14, 2010|accessdate=September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other members assigned to that crew were commander [[Christopher Ferguson]], pilot [[Douglas G. Hurley]], and fellow mission specialist [[Rex J. Walheim]]. In January 2011, NASA added [[STS-135]] to the manifest as the final space shuttle mission, scheduled to launch in July 2011; STS-134 was conducted successfully in May 2011, requiring no rescue flight. The mission launched successfully on 8 July 2011 and landed on July 21.

===AIAA===
Dr. Magnus left NASA Astronaut corps to become the Executive Director of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] (AIAA) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/SecondaryTwoColumn.aspx?id=13857 |title=AIAA Announces Sandra H.

'''Semiconductor memory''' is a [[digital electronics|digital electronic]] [[data storage]] device, often used as [[computer memory]], implemented with [[semiconductor device|semiconductor electronic devices]] on an [[integrated circuit]] (IC). There are many different types of implementations using various technologies.

Most types of semiconductor memory have the property of [[random access memory|random access]],&lt;ref name=FIFO&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lin|first1=Wen C.|title=CRC Handbook of Digital System Design, Second Edition|date=1990|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0849342724|page=225|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=3EYgfSsNwMUC&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;dq=fifo%20memory%20chip&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027130129/https://books.google.es/books?id=3EYgfSsNwMUC&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;dq=fifo%20memory%20chip&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that it takes the same amount of time to access any memory location, so data can be efficiently accessed in any random order.&lt;ref name="Dawoud"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with data storage media such as [[hard disk]]s and [[compact disk|CDs]] which read and write data consecutively and therefore the data can only be accessed in the same sequence it was written.  Semiconductor memory also has much faster [[access time]]s than other types of data storage; a [[byte]] of data can be written to or read from semiconductor memory within a few [[nanosecond]]s, while access time for rotating storage such as hard disks is in the range of milliseconds.  For these reasons it is used for main [[computer memory]] (primary storage), to hold data the computer is currently working on, among other uses.

[[Shift register]]s, [[processor register]]s, [[data buffer]]s and other small digital registers that have no [[address decoder|memory address decoding mechanism]] are not considered as memory although they also store digital data.

==Description==
In a semiconductor memory chip, each [[binary digit|bit]] of binary data is stored in a tiny circuit called a ''[[Memory cell (computing)|memory cell]]'' consisting of one to several [[transistor]]s.  The memory cells are laid out in rectangular arrays on the surface of the chip.  The 1-bit memory cells are grouped in small units called ''words'' which are accessed together as a single memory address. Memory is manufactured in [[word length]] that is usually a power of two, typically ''N''=1, 2, 4 or 8 bits.

Data is accessed by means of a binary number called a [[memory address]] applied to the chip's address pins, which specifies which word in the chip is to be accessed.  If the memory address consists of ''M'' bits, the number of addresses on the chip is 2&lt;sup&gt;''M''&lt;/sup&gt;, each containing an ''N'' bit word.   Consequently, the amount of data stored in each chip is ''N''2&lt;sup&gt;''M''&lt;/sup&gt; bits.&lt;ref name="Dawoud" /&gt;  The memory storage capacity for ''M'' number of address lines is given by 2&lt;sup&gt;''M''&lt;/sup&gt;, which is usually in power of two: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512  and measured in [[kibibit]]s, [[mebibit]]s, [[gibibit]]s or [[tebibit]]s, etc. {{as of | 2014 }} the largest semiconductor memory chips hold a few gibibits of data, but higher capacity memory is constantly being developed.    By combining several integrated circuits, memory can be arranged into a larger word length and/or address space than what is offered by each chip, often but not necessarily a [[power of two]].&lt;ref name="Dawoud" /&gt;

The two basic operations performed by a memory chip are "''read''", in which the data contents of a memory word is read out (nondestructively), and "''write''" in which data is stored in a memory word, replacing any data that was previously stored there.  To increase data rate, in some of the latest types of memory chips such as [[DDR SDRAM]] multiple words are accessed with each read or write operation.

In addition to standalone memory chips, blocks of semiconductor memory are integral parts of many computer and data processing integrated circuits.  For example, the [[microprocessor]] chips that run computers contain [[cache memory]] to store instructions awaiting execution.

==Types==
[[Image:RAM n.png|thumb|RAM chips for computers usually come on removable [[memory module]]s like these.  Additional memory can be added to the computer by plugging in additional modules. ]]
'''RAM''' (''[[Random-access memory]]'')  has become a generic term for any semiconductor memory that can be written to, as well as read from, in contrast to ROM ''(below)'', which can only be read.  All semiconductor memory, not just RAM, has the property of [[random access]].

[[Volatile memory]] loses its stored data when the power to the memory chip is turned off. However it can be faster and less expensive than non-volatile memory.  This type is used for the main memory in most computers, since data is stored on the [[hard disk]] while the computer is off.  Major types are:&lt;ref name="Godse"&gt;{{cite book

* '''DRAM''' (''[[Dynamic random-access memory]]'')  which uses memory cells consisting of one [[capacitor]] and one transistor to store each bit.  This is the cheapest and highest in density, so it is used for the main memory in computers.  However the [[electric charge]] that stores the data in the memory cells slowly leaks out, so the memory cells must be periodically [[memory refresh|refreshed]] (rewritten) which requires additional circuitry.  The refresh process is handled internally by the computer and is transparent to its user.
** '''FPM DRAM''' (''[[Dynamic RAM|Fast page mode DRAM]]'')  An older type of asynchronous DRAM  that improved on previous types by allowing repeated accesses to a single "page" of memory to occur at a faster rate.  Used in the mid-1990s.
** '''EDO DRAM''' (''[[Dynamic RAM|Extended data out DRAM]]'')  An older type of asynchronous DRAM which had faster access time than earlier types by being able to initiate a new memory access while data from the previous access was still being transferred.  Used in the later part of the 1990s.
** '''VRAM'''  (''[[Video RAM|Video random access memory]]'')  An older type of [[dual-ported RAM|dual-ported]] memory once used for the [[frame buffer]]s of [[video adapters]] (video cards).
** '''SDRAM''' (''[[Synchronous dynamic random-access memory]]'') This added circuitry to the DRAM chip which synchronizes all operations with a clock signal added to the computer's [[memory bus]].  This allowed the chip to process multiple memory requests simultaneously using ''[[pipelining]]'', to increase the speed. The data on the chip is also divided into ''banks'' which can each work on a memory operation simultaneously.  This became the dominant type of computer memory by about the year 2000.
*** '''DDR SDRAM''' (''[[DDR SDRAM|Double data rate SDRAM]]'') This could transfer twice the data (two consecutive words) on each clock cycle by [[double pumping]] (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock pulse).  Extensions of this idea are the current (2012) technique being used to increase  memory access rate and throughput.  Since it is proving difficult to further increase the internal clock speed of memory chips, these chips increase the transfer rate by transferring more data words on each clock cycle
**** '''[[DDR2 SDRAM]]''' transfers 4 consecutive words per internal clock cycle
**** '''[[DDR3 SDRAM]]''' transfers 8 consecutive words per internal clock cycle.
**** '''[[DDR4 SDRAM]]''' transfers 16 consecutive words per internal clock cycle.
*** '''RDRAM''' (''[[Rambus DRAM]]'') an alternate double data rate memory standard that was used on some Intel systems but ultimately lost out to DDR SDRAM.
*** '''SGRAM''' (''Synchronous graphics RAM'')  a specialized type of SDRAM made for [[graphics adaptor]]s (video cards).  It can perform graphics-related operations such as [[bit masking]] and block write, and can open two pages of memory at once.
*** '''PSRAM''' (''[[dynamic random access memory|Pseudostatic RAM]]'') This is DRAM which has circuitry to perform [[memory refresh]] on the chip, so that it acts like SRAM, allowing the external memory controller to be shut down to save energy.  It is used in a few [[game console]]s such as the [[Wii]]. 
* '''SRAM''' (''[[Static random-access memory]]'') which relies on several [[transistors]] forming a digital [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] to store each [[bit]].  This is less dense and more expensive per bit than DRAM, but faster and does not require [[memory refresh]].  It is used for smaller [[cache memory|cache memories]] in computers. 
* '''[[Content-addressable memory]]''' This is a specialized type in which, instead of accessing data using an address, a data word is applied and the memory returns the location if the word is stored in the memory.  It is mostly incorporated in other chips such as  [[microprocessor]]s where it is used for [[cache memory]].

[[Nonvolatile memory]] preserves the data stored in it during periods when the power to the chip is turned off.  Therefore, it is used for the memory in portable devices, which don't have disks, and for removable [[memory cards]] among other uses.  Major types are:&lt;ref name="Godse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arora" /&gt;
* '''ROM''' (''[[Read-only memory]]'') This is designed to hold permanent data, and in normal operation is only read from, not written to.   Although many types can be written to, the writing process is slow and usually all the data in the chip must be rewritten at once.  It is usually used to store [[system software]] which must be immediately accessible to the computer, such as the [[BIOS]] program which starts the computer, and the software ([[microcode]]) for portable devices and embedded computers such as [[microcontroller]]s.
** '''Mask programmed ROM''' In this type the data is programmed into the chip during manufacture, so it is only used for large production runs.  It cannot be rewritten with new data.
** '''PROM''' (''[[Programmable read-only memory]]'')  In this type the data is written into the chip before it is installed in the circuit, but it can only be written once.  The data is written by plugging the chip into a device called a PROM programmer.
** '''EPROM''' (''[[Erasable programmable read-only memory]]'')  In this type the data in it can be rewritten by removing the chip from the circuit board, exposing it to an [[ultraviolet light]] to erase the existing data, and plugging it into a [[PROM programmer]].  The IC package has a small transparent "window" in the top to admit the UV light.   It is often used for prototypes and small production run devices, where the program in it may have to be changed at the factory. [[Image:4Mbit EPROM Toshiba TC574200D (2).jpg|thumb|4M EPROM, showing transparent window used to erase the chip]]
** '''EEPROM''' (''[[Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory]]'')   In this type the data can be rewritten electrically, while the chip is on the circuit board, but the writing process is slow.  This type is used to hold [[firmware]], the low level microcode which runs hardware devices, such as the [[BIOS]] program in most computers, so that it can be updated.
* '''NVRAM ''([[Flash memory]])'''''   In this type the writing process is intermediate in speed between EEPROMS and RAM memory; it can be written to, but not fast enough to serve as main memory.    It is often used as a semiconductor version of a [[hard disk]], to store files.   It is used in portable devices such as PDAs,  [[USB flash drives]], and removable [[memory card]]s used in [[digital camera]]s and [[cellphone]]s.

The '''Army Research Laboratory''' ('''ARL''') is the [[U.S. Army]]'s corporate research laboratory. ARL is headquartered at the [[Adelphi Laboratory Center]] (ALC) in Adelphi, Maryland.  Its largest single site is at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], Maryland.  Other major ARL locations include [[Research Triangle Park]], North Carolina, [[White Sands Missile Range]], New Mexico, Orlando, Florida, and NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]], Ohio and [[Langley Research Center]], Virginia.

In addition to the Army Research Office, ARL has six technical directorates:
*Computational and Information Sciences
*Human Research and Engineering
*Sensors and Electron Devices
*Survivability/Lethality Analysis
*Vehicle Technology
*Weapons and Materials Research

==History==
Before the forming of the ARL, the United States Army had research facilities dating back to 1820 when the laboratory at [[Watertown Arsenal]], Massachusetts, studied pyrotechnics and waterproof paper cartridges. This facility would evolve into the Materials Technology Laboratory. Most pre-[[World War II|WWII]] military research occurred within the military by military personnel, but in 1945, the Army published a policy affirming the need for civilian scientific contributions in military planning and weapons production.&lt;ref name="ARL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arl.army.mil/www/DownloadedInternetPages/CurrentPages/AboutARL/ARL_History1992-2003.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |title=History of the Army Research Laboratory |work=Army Research Laboratory |publisher=United States Army |accessdate=2008-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112152506/http://www.arl.army.mil/www/DownloadedInternetPages/CurrentPages/AboutARL/ARL_History1992-2003.pdf |archive-date=2008-11-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-military involvement before this time was frequent; however, methods for contribution to warfare technology was on limited and incidental basis. 
On June 11, 1946, a new research and development division of the War Department General Staff was created; however, due to internal forces within the military which supported the traditional technical service structure the division was closed. A variety of reorganizations took place over the next four decades, which put many organizations in command of Army research and development.&lt;ref name="ARL" /&gt; Often commanders of these organizations were advocates of the reorganization, while some middle level management was opposed to the change.&lt;ref name="ARL" /&gt;

===Reorganization===
The ARL represents the realization of a memorandum dated January 6, 1989 from the LABCOM Commander recommending integrating the corporate laboratories into a single entity. As part of the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] of 1989/1991, the consolidated research facilities would be located primarily at Adelphi Laboratory Center and [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]. This would also relocate the majority of operations at MTL to APG. The Federal Advisory Commission reviewed and accepted the creation of ARL in 1992.

==Directorates==
===Army Research Office===
The ''Army Research Office'' (ARO), located in [[Research Triangle Park]], funds extramural basic research, that is, research in outside academic and industrial organizations, providing grants to both single investigators and university-affiliated research centers, as well as outreach programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Army Research Office|url=http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=29|publisher=U.S. Army Research Laboratory|date=6 July 2012|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational and Information Sciences===
The ''Computational and Information Sciences Directorate'' (CISD) is the foremost U.S. Army organization for research and development of modern electronic systems. This research supports capabilities in the analysis, distribution, and assimilation of real or simulated digitized battlefield information. In addition to the digitized war initiatives, [[high performance computing]] research is performed at a variety of centers under the ARL. The use of [[supercomputers]] for mathematical simulations instead of mass [[Manufacturing|fabrication]] can result in the conservation of human and physical resources. The directorate is a key player in the [[International Technology Alliance]] in conjunction with SEDD and HRED directorates.

===Human Research and Engineering===
The U.S. Army Research Laboratory's ''Human Research and Engineering Directorate'' (HRED) is the principal Army organization for research and development (R&amp;D) in the human dimension. HRED conducts a broad-based program of scientific research and technology directed toward optimizing Soldier performance and Soldier-machine interactions to maximize battlefield effectiveness. HRED also executes an analysis mission that provides the Army with human factors leadership to ensure that Soldier performance requirements are adequately considered in technology development and system design. HRED coordinates technologies within the Army, other services and their laboratories, industry, and academia to leverage basic and applied research opportunities for the benefit of the Army.

===Sensors and Electron Devices===
''Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate'' (SEDD) is a group dedicated to produce equipment from tiny chips to fully integrated systems. SEDD also helps develop [[sensors]] and electronic devices which become an important part of modern warfare. Other components of this directorate include: multifunction radio frequency equipment, autonomous sensing, [[power generation]] and management, and [[signal processing]] algorithms. One of the best ways to protect the soldier is to develop autonomous sensing systems for all activities, from intelligence gathering to waging warfare.

===Survivability/Lethality Analysis===
The ''Survivability/Lethality Analysis Directorate'' (SLAD) is the primary center for expertise in survivability, lethality, and vulnerability of all army systems, across the full range of battlefield threats:  ballistic, [[electronic warfare]], [[Information warfare|information operations]], and nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare.  SLAD's mission is to assist technology and system developers in optimizing system designs and to provide analytical data to evaluators and decision makers in the Army and the [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]].

===Vehicle Technology===
The U.S. Army Research Laboratory's ''Vehicle Technology Directorate'' (VTD) manages research and development of [[vehicle propulsion]] and structure. In addition, VTD conducts analytical and practical experiments in loads analysis, structural dynamics, aero-elasticity, structural acoustics, and [[vibration reduction]]. VTD makes ground combat vehicles lighter, more reliable, safer, and more fuel efficient. Air combat vehicles such as the [[helicopter]] are studied to decrease the vibrations caused by the rotors. [[Metal]]lic materials are engineered to increase strength and decrease [[corrosion]] through the use of [[Composite material|composites]]. The divisions of VTD are Loads &amp; Dynamics, Structural Mechanics, Engine &amp; Transmission Systems, Engine Components, and Unmanned Vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?Action=34&amp;Page=34 U.S. Army Research Laboratory, "Vehicle Technology" ''Vehicle Technology Directorate'' (VTD)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weapons and Materials Research===
The U.S. Army Research Laboratory ''Weapons and Materials Research Directorate'' (WMRD) is the principal U.S. Army organization for research and development in weapons and materials technologies. The directorate is charged with making bullets pierce farther and [[ballistic vest]]s stronger. Although these interests may seem opposed, the goal is to increase the survivability of the soldier. In the WMRD, traditional armaments are studied, as are advanced ballistic defense systems. This directorate is especially linked with VTD in order to produce safer vehicles, transports, and aircraft. One aspect of this directorate's analysis duty is to evaluate military technologies from an economical standpoint in order to reduce overall system costs.

==Federated Laboratories==
Beginning in 1996, the Army Research Laboratory entered into innovative cooperative agreements with industrial and academic partners to form "federated laboratories," or "FedLabs", to perform research in broad areas important to the U.S. Army where the ARL could extract significant leverage from work being performed in the commercial and academic arenas.  The first three FedLabs were in Advanced Displays, Advanced Sensors, and Telecommunications.  Each FedLab was a large consortium of companies, universities, and non-profit organizations, with both an overall industrial leader and an ARL leader. The cooperative agreements forming the FedLabs were somewhat unusual in that the ARL was not a mere funder of research, but an active consortium participant.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Edward (1998). Reinventing Government Research and Development: A Status Report on Management Initiatives and Reinvention Efforts at the Army Research Laboratory. Report ARL-SR-57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vassiliou, Marius (2007), "The Virtual Research Laboratory," Proc. 2007  IEEE Aerospace Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first three FedLabs won a National Performance Award in 1999 from then-Vice President [[Al Gore]].

==Collaborative Technology and Research Alliances==
Collaborative Technology and Research Alliances is a term for partnerships between Army laboratories and centers, private industry and academia for performing research and technology development intended to benefit the US Army. The partnerships are funded by the [[United States Army|US Army]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=93|title=Collaborative Alliances {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory|website=www.arl.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
