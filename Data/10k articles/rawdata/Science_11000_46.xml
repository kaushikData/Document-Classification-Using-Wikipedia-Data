}}

The '''A507''' is an A-class road in England, linking the [[M1 motorway]] near [[Milton Keynes]] to the [[A10 road (Great Britain)|A10]] at [[Buntingford]]. Beginning at junction 13 of the M1, the road heads east past [[Ridgmont]] to [[Ampthill]]. Here it passes between Ampthill and its close neighbour [[Flitwick]], essentially separating the two. After this it passes [[Flitton]] before encountering the [[A6 road (England)|A6]] at a roundabout. Passing [[Shefford, Bedfordshire|Shefford]] the road briefly multiplexes with the [[A600 road|A600]] before crossing the A6001 and bypassing [[Stotfold]]. Crossing the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] at junction 10 of the A1(M), where the motorway becomes a normal A-road, the A507 then heads south east through [[Baldock]]. After bridging over the [[A505 road|A505]] (here being the recently opened Baldock north-south bypass) it terminates at a roundabout with the [[A10 road (Great Britain)|A10]] at Buntingford.

==Ridgmont Bypass==

In 2008, a bypass opened alongside the M1 at Ridgmont. Prior to this the A507 formerly passed through [[Husborne Crawley]] and [[Ridgmont]], where it met the [[A4012 road]]. The bypass includes three roundabouts and a bridge over the [[Marston Vale Line]].

"'''A calorie is a calorie'''" is a tautology used to convey the speaker's conviction that the concept of the "calorie" is in fact a sufficient way to describe energy content of food.

The [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]] phrase means that regardless of the form of [[food calorie]] a person consumes (whether a carbohydrate, protein or fat calorie) the energetic value of such a calorie, is identical to any other. One dietary calorie contains 4,184 joules of [[energy]]. With this knowledge, it is easy to assume that all calories have equal value.&lt;ref name="A calorie is NOT a calorie"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://authoritynutrition.com/6-reasons-why-a-calorie-is-not-a-calorie/|title=A calorie is NOT a calorie|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Authority Nutrition|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, good [[human nutrition]] measures foods for other values than just energy in calories.{{Cite web|url=Richard_D{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== History ==
In 1878, German nutritionist [[Max Rubner]] crafted what he called the "isodynamic law".&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Taubes|first=Gary|title=What Really Makes Us Fat|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/opinion/sunday/what-really-makes-us-fat.html|accessdate=25 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law claims that the basis of nutrition is the [[Conservation of energy|exchange of energy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biochmeical Journal, Volume 16|year=1922|publisher=Biochemical Society|page=751|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxMkAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=isodynamic+law}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was applied to the study of obesity in the early 1900s by [[Carl von Noorden (pathologist)|Carl von Noorden]]. Von Noorden had two theories about what caused people to develop obesity. The first simply avowed Rubner's notion that "a calorie is a calorie". The second theorized that [[obesity]] development depends on how the body partitions calories for either use or storage.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;   Since 1925, a calorie has been defined in terms of the joule. The definition of a calorie changed in 1948, which became one calorie is equal to approximately 4,2 joules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andrews|first=A.|date=2015|title=Calorie|url=http://ipacez.nd.edu.au/login?url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/acbvet/calorie/0|journal=Black's Veterinary Dictionary|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related concept of "calorie in, calorie out" is contested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taubes|first=Gary|title=The Scientist and the Stairmaster|url=http://nymag.com/news/sports/38001/index3.html|accessdate=8 May 2013|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite having become a commonly held and frequently referenced belief in [[nutritionism]], the implications associated with "a calorie is a calorie" are still being debated.&lt;ref name=Health.com&gt;{{cite news|last=Sass|first=Cynthia|title=Why Calorie Counts are Wrong: 6 Diet Myths, Busted|url=http://news.health.com/2013/02/07/why-calorie-counts-are-wrong-6-diet-myths-busted/|accessdate=25 April 2013|newspaper=health.com|date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gann|first=Carrie|title=For Calories, It's All About Quality Over Quantity, Harvard Study Says|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/calorie-calorie-harvard-study-compares-popular-weight-loss/story?id=16654506|work=ABC News|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NOVA&gt;{{cite web|last=Nesheim|first=Malden|title=Is a Calorie a Calorie?|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/is-a-calorie-a-calorie.html|work=NOVA|publisher=PBS|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wisdom and [[Starvation response|effects of skipping meals]] in an attempt to limit caloric intake is also still largely debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeratsky |first=Katherine|title=Breakfast: How does it help weight control?|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-and-nutrition/AN01119|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Breakfast is 'most important meal'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2824987.stm|accessdate=28 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reinagel |first=Monica|title=Is Skipping Breakfast Bad For You?|url=http://nutritiondiva.quickanddirtytips.com/is-skipping-breakfast-bad-for-you.aspx|publisher=Nutrition Diva|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calorie counting ==
Calorie amounts found on food labels are based on the [[Atwater system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Leonard|date=1944|title=The Atwater system of calculating the caloric value of diets|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/28/6/443.extract|journal=440 - 443|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy of the system is disputed, despite no real proposed alternatives. For example, a 2012 study by a USDA scientist concluded that the measured energy content of a sample of almonds was 32% lower than the estimated Atwater value.&lt;ref name="Nuts"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nesheim, Nestle|first=Malden, Marion|title=Is a Calorie a Calorie?|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/is-a-calorie-a-calorie.html|accessdate=2013-05-08|newspaper=PBS NOVA|date=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is known that some calories are lost in waste, without ever having been chemically converted or stored. The driving mechanism behind caloric intake is absorption, which occurs largely in the [[Digestion#Small intestine|small intestine]] and distributes nutrients to the circulatory and lymphatic capillaries by means of [[osmosis]], [[diffusion]] and [[active transport]]. Fat, in particular is emulsified by [[bile]] produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder where it is released to the small intestine via the [[bile duct]]. A relatively lesser amount of absorption, composed primarily of water, occurs in the [[Digestion#Large intestine|large intestine]].

== Research ==

=== Wake Forest University Research ===
In 2007, a group of [[Wake Forest University]] researchers published a report from a six-year [[longitudinal study]] in which they fed two groups of monkeys the same number of calories and dietary levels of fat, with the only difference being that one group was fed foods higher in [[trans fat]]. The high trans fat group gained 30% more [[belly fat]] compared to their lower trans fat counterparts.&lt;ref name=Monkeys&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kavanagh|first=Kylie|author2=Kate L. Jones |author3=Janet Sawyer |author4=Kathryn Kelley |author5=J. Jeffrey Carr |author6=Janice D. Wagner |author7=Lawrence L. Rudel|title=Trans Fat Diet Induces Abdominal Obesity and Changes in Insulin Sensitivity in Monkeys|journal=Obesity|date=July 2007|volume=15|issue=7|pages=1675–1684|doi=10.1038/oby.2007.200|pmid=17636085}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that the type of calories consumed do affect [[body weight]].&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt;

The physical activities of the monkeys were not taken into account during this study.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The sample size was 38.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Harvard University Research ===
In 2011, a group of [[Harvard University]] researchers published the results of a study in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] that followed 120,877 highly educated men and women over a period of 12 to 20 years. The study focused on factors that influence [[weight gain]] including diet, exercise, sleep, smoking, alcohol intake and television watching. Participants began the study as healthy adults. Every two years, they would complete detailed questionnaires about their eating and other habits. The results found that an array of factors influenced the fluctuation of a person's weight. The average participant gained about one pound per year. Among the results of the study, it was found that the types of foods people ate had a larger effect on weight gain than physical activity.&lt;ref name=Nurse&gt;{{cite news|last=Brody|first=Jane E.|title=Still County Calories? Your Weight-Loss Plan May Be Outdated|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/health/19brody.html|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the researchers "Consumption of processed foods that are higher in starches, refined grains, fats, and sugars can increase weight gain." and "These results suggest that future policies and research efforts to prevent obesity should consider food structure and processing as potentially relevant dietary metrics."&lt;ref name=Journal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mozaffarian |first=Dariush|author2=Tao Hao |author3=Eric B. Rimm |author4=Walter C. Willett |author5=Frank B. Hu |title=Changes in Diet and Lifestyle and Long-Term Weight Gain in Women and Men|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1014296|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1014296?query=TOC#t=articleTop|accessdate=7 May 2013|volume=364|issue=25|pages=2392–404|pmid=21696306|pmc=3151731|date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead author of the study concluded in an interview that trying to count calories, in an effort to lose weight, would be futile unless one is examining the kinds of calories being consumed.&lt;ref name="Nurse"/&gt;

== Facts ==
One dietary Calorie contains 4184 joules of energy. The human body is a highly complex biochemical system that undergoes processes which regulate energy balance. The metabolic pathways for protein are less efficient than the metabolic pathways for carbohydrates and fat.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Protein contains four calories per gram, although a large part of the calories are lost as heat when metabolised by the body.&lt;ref name="A calorie is NOT a calorie"/&gt;

It may be easy to consume 500 calories worth of ice cream or chocolate in one sitting, although it may be difficult to eat 500 calories of eggs or carrot in one sitting.&lt;ref name="A calorie is NOT a calorie"/&gt;

=== Boston Children's Hospital Clinical Trial ===
In 2012, the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] published the results of a [[clinical trial]] performed by a group of researchers that investigated whether dietary composition affected weight loss.&lt;ref name=JAMA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ebbeling |first=Cara|author2=anis F. Swain |author3=Henry A. Feldman |author4=William W. Wong |author5=David L. Hachey |author6=Erica Garcia-Lago |author7=David S. Ludwig |title=Effects of Dietary Composition on Energy Expenditure During Weight-Loss Maintenance|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=307|issue=23|pages=2627–2634|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.6607|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1199154#COMMENT|accessdate=25 April 2013|pmid=22735432|pmc=3564212|date=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study tracked 21 individuals. The individuals first lost at least 12.5% of their body weight, and were then placed on one of three different dietary regimens:

# A diet high in protein and fat, but with fewer carbohydrates
# A diet low in fat, emphasizing whole grains, fruit and vegetables
# A diet with a low [[glycemic index]], focusing on the type of carbohydrates consumed

The results showed that the first group burned the most calories, but also displayed increased markers of [[Oxidative stress|stress]] and [[inflammation]] in the body, which can lead to [[cardiovascular disease]], among [[Diseases of affluence|other health problems]]. The second group burned fewer calories than the other two groups, and also displayed certain metabolic indicators that typically precede weight gain. The third group burned a reasonable number of calories, but notably did not display increased markers of disease-causing stress. The researchers concluded that the type of calories consumed does affect the number of calories burned by an individual. This conclusion is in direct contrast to what the commonly held belief implies.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOVA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1762">An '''Aragoscope''' is a theoretical design for a telescope, based on diffraction around the edge of an occluding disc, named after French scientist [[Francois Arago]].

==Concept==
The light diffracted around the edge of a perfectly circular occluder interferes constructively at the central axis, and the resolution at that point would be equal to the resolution of conventional lens with the same size of the occluder. Only light intensity would be lower.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2014_phase_i_webster_cash_the_aragoscope.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis it would be possible to create a telescope by placing a suitable disc in space accompanied by a separate telescope some distance away along its axis. This concept has been explored by NASA and received Phase One funding in June 2014 by the [[NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts]] (NIAC) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Aragoscope: Ultra-High Resolution Optics at Low Cost|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/the-aragoscope-ultra-high-resolution-optics-at-low-cost/#.U5givlKSz8s|website=NASA|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/today/2015/01/23/new-space-telescope-concept-could-image-objects-far-higher-resolution-hubble|website=CU Bolder Today|accessdate=9 February 2017|title=New space telescope concept could image objects at far higher resolution than Hubble}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is important to note that this is a very different approach from that taken by another NASA project, the [[New Worlds Mission]], which aims to use an occluder with "petals", otherwise known as a starshade, specifically designed to ''avoid'' diffraction onto the central axis.

{{Regions of Arkansas}}
The '''Arkansas River Valley''' (usually shortened to '''River Valley''') is a region in [[Arkansas]] defined by the [[Arkansas River]] in the western part of the state. Generally defined as the area between the [[The Ozarks|Ozark]] and [[Ouachita Mountains]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |title= Arkansas Tour Guide |year= 2013 |publisher= [[Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism]] |page= 142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the River Valley is characterized by flat lowlands covered in fertile farmland and lakes periodically interrupted by high peaks. [[Mount Magazine]], [[Mount Nebo (Arkansas)|Mount Nebo]], and [[Petit Jean Mountain]] compose the '''Tri-Peaks Region''', a further subdivision of the River Valley popular with hikers and outdoors enthusiasts. In addition to the outdoor recreational activities available to residents and visitors of the region, the River Valley contains Arkansas's wine country as well as hundreds of historical sites throughout the area.It is one of six natural divisions of Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |title= Arkansas Tour Guide |year= 2013 |publisher= Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism |page= 141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The Arkansas River Valley is not formally defined along county boundaries, including all of [[Logan County, Arkansas|Logan]] and [[Sebastian County, Arkansas|Sebastian]] counties and portions of [[Conway County, Arkansas|Conway]], [[Franklin County, Arkansas|Franklin]], [[Johnson County, Arkansas|Johnson]], [[Perry County, Arkansas|Perry]], [[Pope County, Arkansas|Pope]], and [[Yell County, Arkansas|Yell]] counties.

===Subdivisions===
* Arkansas Valley Hills - North and east of the Arkansas River, sometimes associated with the Ozarks
* Bottomlands - Low swamps and prairies along the Arkansas River itself, {{convert|10|mi|km}} wide in some places
* [[Fort Smith metropolitan area]] - Sebastian, Crawford, and Franklin counties in Arkansas (also includes [[Le Flore County, Oklahoma|Le Fore]] and [[Sequoyah County, Oklahoma|Sequoyah]] counties in [[Oklahoma]])
* [[Ozark National Forest]] - a small, discontinuous portion of the federally protected area is within the region
* Tri-peaks Region - Region punctuated by three steep mountains: Mount Magazine, Mount Nebo and Petit Jean Mountain
* Valley - south of the Arkansas River, level plains and gently rolling hills
* [[Altus AVA|Wine Country]] - [[American Viticultural Area]] near Altus

==History==
[[File:Rock House Cave, Petit Jean State Park 002.jpg|right|thumb|Anthropomorphic cave art in Rock House Cave at [[Petit Jean State Park]]]]
In the [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Colonial era]], the River Valley was inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, including [[Caddo]], [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Tunica people|Tunica]], and [[Quapaw]] tribes. Most first encounters describe scattered villages and individual farmsteads in the River Valley, unlike the organized "towns" and groves and orchards encountered in eastern Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Sabo III |first= George |title= Native Americans |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=408 |work=[[Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture]] |publisher=[[Butler Center for Arkansas Studies]] at the [[Central Arkansas Library System]] |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2016-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of what is known about these early societies has been uncovered by the [[Arkansas Archaeological Survey]] and the [[Arkansas Archaeological Society]] at [[Carden Bottoms]] in [[Yell County, Arkansas|Yell County]] near the Arkansas and [[Petit Jean River]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Stewart-Abernathy |first= Leslie C. |title= Carden Bottom |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=5245 |work=Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture |publisher=Butler Center for Arkansas Studies at the Central Arkansas Library System |date=2015-10-01 |accessdate=2016-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research at the site has linked artifacts to cave art (pictured at right) in a cave on Petit Jean Mountain, as well as establishing links to the Caddo, Osage, and Quapaw tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |first= Sunnie |last= Clahchischiligi |title= Osages participate in Carden Bottoms excavation in western Arkansas |work=Osage News |url= http://osagenews.org/en/article/2011/06/16/Osages-participate-carden-bottoms-excavation-western-arkansas/ |date= 2011-06-16 |location= Pawhuska, Oklahoma |accessdate= 2016-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hernando de Soto]] became the first European explorer to enter Arkansas in 1541. His expedition of 600 Spanish explorers searching for gold and riches crossed into Arkansas across the [[Mississippi River]], and explored the state for the next two years. The expedition traveled to Tanico, an important city somewhere in the River Valley, in September 1542. The following month, the expedition fought with a tribe referred to as the Tula somewhere near Fort Smith. This fighting apparently caused de Soto to turn the expedition back east, leaving the River Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Mitchem |first= Jeffrey M. |title= Route of the De Soto Expedition |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=7679 |work=Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture |publisher=Butler Center for Arkansas Studies at the Central Arkansas Library System |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2016-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War===

===Reconstruction through New South===
[[File:FT. SMITH'S BELLE GROVE HISTORIC DISTRICT.jpg|right|thumb|Fort Smith began to develop following Reconstruction, including the [[Belle Grove Historic District|Belle Grove Neighborhood]]. Pictured here is the {{circa|1840}} John Rogers House]]
{{See also|Reconstruction Era|New South}}
Following the war, the Southern economy was in shambles, including Arkansas. The cost of the war effort, loss of [[human capital]], and Confederate currency losing value were serious issues for the South in addition to the destruction of property, infrastructure, and crops. Many parts of Arkansas had descended into lawlessness and violence between [[whitecapping]] groups (including the [[Ku Klux Klan]]), [[freedmen]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], and unaffiliated bandits taking advantage of the chaos. Indicative of the disarray, [[Radical Republican]] [[Governors of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Powell Clayton]] declared [[martial law]] in ten counties following [[Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1868|reelection in 1868]].&lt;ref name="harvp|History|2002|p= 224"&gt;{{harvp|"History"|2002|p= 224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no River Valley counties were initially subject to the proclamation, Claytdded four more counties, including one partial-River Valley county, Conway County.&lt;ref name="harvp|History|2002|p= 224" /&gt; Since settlement, the River Valley had been a largely cashless society with significantly less reliance on slave labor compared to [[plantation agriculture]] areas like the Arkansas Delta and elsewhere in the [[Deep South]]. The Klan had limited support, and much of the area was viewed steadily Re
Due to its relatively strong position following the Civil War, the River Valley attracted new settlement throughout Reconstruction. Populations of [[Catholic Church in Austria|Austrian Catholics]], [[Catholic Church in Germany|German Catholics]], and [[Catholic Church in Germany|German Catholics]] and [[Lutheranism by region#Europe|Lutherans]] were relocating to the River Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|"Immigration"|1966|p= 354}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some immigrated directly from Europe, but most came from early settlements in the [[Ohio River Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|"Immigration"|1966|p= 355}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lutherans generally immigrated in organized companies, where the Catholics came independently, although some Catholic settlements like Clarksville and [[Subiaco Academy|Subiaco]] were founded by organized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|"Immigration"|1966|pp= 355-356}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These settlements received support from existing immigrant populations in Little Rock and Fort Smith, and groups of Protestant settlers also establishing settlements in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|"Immigration"|1966|pp= 356-357}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the River Valley's small towns were founded by these groups, beginning as small clusters of immigrants and evolving into cohesive communities.

Many immigrants came to the River Valley searching for agricultural prosperity, particularly by farming cotton, which could [[king cotton|fetch high prices at market]] and quickly turn a farm into a profitable enterprise. Upon arriving in the region, many found only densely forested upland to be the only property they could afford.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|"Immigration"|1966|p= 360}}.&lt;/ref&gt; River Valley soil and climate are much less conducive to cotton cultivation than the [[Arkansas Delta]], and many settlers struggled. Eventually, a preference for mixed farming emerged, including potatoes and other garden vegetables, to protect against a poor cotton crop sending a farm into economic ruin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|"Immigration"|1966|pp= 360-361}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coal Mining====
Coal mining was an important industry in the River Valley's early history. Dangerous and demanding, the industry attracted Swiss and German immigrants who were unable to establish productive farms. Mining became prominent by 1873, especially around the Altus area. The Swiss and German immigrants found the rolling hills similar to the topography of their homeland. Due to the climate, fertile soil and immigrants accustomed to wine with their meals, several wineries were established in the River Valley. The German community thrived with coal mining and railroad work driving the local economy. The Central Collegiate Institute was established in Altus in 1876 (now known as [[Hendrix College]] in [[Conway, Arkansas|Conway]]) and Hiram and Lydia College in 1890 (which went defunct in 1906). However, the railroad's prominence declined during the [[Great Depression]], shrinking Altus's economy and population.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |title= Altus (Franklin County) |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=5599 |first= Lola |last= Shropshire |work= Encyclopedia of Arkansas History &amp; Culture |publisher= Butler Center for Arkansas Studies at the Central Arkansas Library System |date= December 22, 2015 |accessdate= August 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the [[Altus Area Coal Miner's Memorial]] is a series of five sculptures paying homage to area coal miners, with the names of over 2,500 local miners engraved at the site. Greenwood also has a Coal Miner's Memorial near the town square, with a restored coal railroad car and names of Sebastian County coal workers engraved on site.

Elsewhere in the county, cotton and timber had given way to strawberry, hay, and cattle. However, competition introduced into the market by the railroads allowed farmers in Texas and other states to undercut the prices offered by River Valley farmers. An exploration period for a new regional crop tested beans, legumes, and tomatoes before settling on [[mustard greens]] and [[spinach]]. The spinach and greens products allowed Alma to leverage its existing fruit canning facility owned by the Alma Canning and Evaporating Company, which had been in the area since 1888. In 1987, Alma claimed the title of "Spinach Capital of the World" and erected a [[Popeye]] statue in front of the Chamber of Commerce building.&lt;ref name="alma" /&gt;

==Geography==

===Geology===

===Cities===
The most populous city within the River Valley is [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], the principal city of the [[Fort Smith metropolitan area]] that also includes [[Van Buren, Arkansas|Van Buren]] and [[Alma, Arkansas|Alma]]. Fort Smith is the second-largest city in Arkansas, and serves as a regional hub for culture, health care and transportation. Approximately {{convert|84|mi|km}} east, Russellville was the 16th largest city in Arkansas at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate= 2016-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is an important economic, education and population center in the state. Other cities in the River Valley are mostly of county-level significance, gateways to nearby recreational sites or small rural settlements. Cities such as [[Booneville, Arkansas|Booneville]], [[Clarksville, Arkansas|Clarksville]], [[Morrilton, Arkansas|Morrilton]], [[Paris, Arkansas|Paris]], and [[Perryville, Arkansas|Perryville]] serve as cultural and economic centers within the rural counties of the River Valley.&lt;ref name="tg"&gt;{{ cite book |title= Arkansas Tour Guide |year= 2013 |publisher= Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism |page= 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
The River Valley has generally mild winters and hot, humid summers. Temperatures are generally warmer than in the Ozarks and cooler than Central Arkansas, although the wide variance in elevation in the River Valley can create locally different climactic conditions. The western portion of the River Valley (i.e., around Fort Smith) is situated near an area known as [[Tornado Alley]] in the central United States.

&lt;!-- ===Cultivation===
Although no data are recorded specifically for the River Valley region, estimates can be derived from [[United States Department of Agriculture]] county-level statistics. The following statistics are for the 2014-15 crop year totals for Conway, Franklin, Logan, Perry, Pope, Sebastian, and Yell counties. &lt;ref name=AgStats&gt;{{cite web|title= National Agricultural Statistics Service County Level Data |url= https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/8E963929-4E9F-3C9A-99E0-87EC981A0760 |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture |accessdate= 2016-05-09 |year= 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{See also|Culture of Arkansas}}
Vineyards and wineries around Altus have been in the same family for generations. The River Valley's first wineries date to the postbellum era, when they were founded to produce wine for the Swiss and German immigrants relocating to the area to work in coal mines. This culture lives on today in the five vineyards still in operation. The Chateau Aux Arc Vineyards and Winery is the largest US [[Chardonnay]] producer outside of [[California]], and the largest [[Zinfandel]] producer in Arkansas. Mount Bethel Winery has been in operation for over 100 years, and offers a tasting, tour and gift shop for visitors. The Post Winery has been in the Post family for five generations. Visitors can buy wines, tour the winery and watch the production process.

===Arts===
The [[Alma Performing Arts Center]] is the largest and most popular performing arts venue in the River Valley.&lt;ref name="alma" &gt;{{ cite web |title= Alma (Crawford County) |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4405 |first1= Debbie Walden |last1= Davis |author2= Staff of the Encyclopedia of Arkansas History &amp; Culture |work= Encyclopedia of Arkansas History &amp; Culture |publisher= Butler Center for Arkansas Studies at the Central Arkansas Library System |date= January 27, 2014 |accessdate= August 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russellville, the Arkansas River Valley Arts Center offers visual arts as well as art classes and infrequent performances. The Greenwood Performing Arts Center has over 1,000 seats and is used for various performances in the city. In Clarksville, the Walton Fine Arts Center on the campus of the [[University of the Ozarks]] offers university theater, performers, and speakers to patrons. The Stephens Gallery hosts exhibits of glass and ivory carvings. In Van Buren, the King Opera House is a restored 1880s opera house, now holding various events throughout the year.

===Annual cultural events===

===Protected areas===
The River Valley contains a large quantity of protected areas, with broad diversity across the region and several different managing agencies.

Near Booneville, [[Blue Mountain Lake (Arkansas)|Blue Mountain Lake]] offers a variety of recreational opportunities. The Blue Mountain Wildlife Demonstration Area is a bird-dog field training center of international renown. The Jack Creek Recreation Area and Knopper's Ford Recreation Area offer well-known Arkansas [[swimming hole]]s as well as hiking, camping and fishing.

Near Clarksville, the Spadra Waterfront Marina offers RV camping, boat rentals, and guided trips along Spadra Creek. North of Clarksville, Lake Ludwig offers swimming, boating and fishing to visitors.

South of Dardanelle, the [[Holla Bend National Wildlife Refuge]] protects over {{convert|7000|acre|ha}} of bottomland and wetland surrounded by a cutoff meander of the Arkansas River. Wintering waterfowl and other migrating species use the area as a safe haven during their journey. The NWR offers a driving tour with interpretative signs.

On the Fourche LaFave River near Ola, the [[Nimrod Lake]] is managed by the USACE as a crappie fishing destination and camping area.

The consortium is head by the National Library of Sweden which negotiate and administrate license agreements for e-resource packages. The participating institutions sign a power of attorney which allows the National Librarian to sign contracts with the e-resource providers.

==History and Scope==
Bibsam Consortium was formed in 1996 in order to negotiate license agreements for electronic resources on behalf of Swedish Universities, research institutes and government agencies in Sweden. The total turnover of the agreements in 2015 was € 33 million and was  € 35 million in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweden stands up for open access – cancels agreement with Elsevier|url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/kungliga_biblioteket/pressreleases/sweden-stands-up-for-open-access-cancels-agreement-with-elsevier-2508242|website=Mynewsdesk|accessdate=21 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Out of this, 73% of the turnover is from the ten large universities of Sweden.  There are six members in National Library of Sweden to negotiate and administrate the 100 license agreements for approximately 40 e-resource packages &lt;ref name=bibsam/&gt;.

==Negotiation with Elsevier==
In 2018, Bibsam Consortium terminated its agreement with [[Elsevier]] publishers in order to stop rising prices of publishing and to support open access publishing &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweden to open source digital science journals and boycotts Elsevier|url=https://goodereader.com/blog/digital-education/sweden-to-open-source-digital-science-journals-and-boycotts-elsevier|website=Good e-Reader|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If the termination takes into effect by 1 July 2018, Swedish Universities and colleges will not have access to 2100 e-journals published by Elsevier. However, all articles published between 1 January 1995 and 30 June 2018 will still be available &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweden makes a stand for open access – terminates Elsevier agreement Karolinska Institutet Universitetsbiblioteket|url=https://kib.ki.se/en/whatsup/news/sweden-makes-stand-open-access-terminates-elsevier-agreement|website=kib.ki.se|accessdate=21 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  [[Astrid Söderbergh Widding]], President of [[Stockholm University]], Chairman of the Bibsam consortium steering committee and Head of the negotiation team, said:
{{quote|Increasing costs of scientific information are straining university budgets on a global scale while publishers operate on high profit margins. An alternative to the current publishing and pricing model is 'open access', where institutions pay to publish their articles and the articles become open for everyone to read, immediately upon publication. We need to monitor the total cost of publication as we see a tendency towards a rapid increase of costs for both reading and publishing. The current system for scholarly communication must change and our only option is to cancel deals when they don’t meet our demands for a sustainable transition to open access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweden stands up for open access – cancels agreement with Elsevier|url=http://openaccess.blogg.kb.se/2018/05/16/sweden-stands-up-for-open-access-cancels-agreement-with-elsevier/|website=OpenAccess.se|accessdate=21 May 2018|language=sv-SE|date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements that Bibsam Consortium asks for are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The agreement with Elsevier is cancelled – Sweden stands up for Open Access  - Mälardalen University Sweden |url=http://www.mdh.se/avtalet-med-elsevier-sags-upp-sverige-tar-stallning-for-oppen-tillgang-1.111854?l=en_UK |accessdate=12 June 2018 |work=www.mdh.se |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Reading access for participating organisations to all articles in Elsevier’s journals.
* A sustainable price model that enables a transition to open access.

==Privacy for research participants==
{{Main|Privacy for research participants|Genetic privacy}}
There is broad consensus that when a person donates a specimen for research then that person has a [[right to privacy]] thereafter.  To this end, researchers balance the need for specimens to be [[Anonymity|anonymous]] or de-identified from [[protected health information]] with the need to have access to data about the specimen so that researchers can use the sample without knowing the identity of the donor.&lt;ref name="whoowns"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkins|first=Alice K.|author2=Kieran C. O'Doherty|title="Who owns your poop?": insights regarding the intersection of human microbiome research and the ELSI aspects of biobanking and related studies.|journal=BMC Medical Genomics|date=7 October 2011|volume=4|pages=72|accessdate=|pmid=21982589|doi=10.1186/1755-8794-4-72|pmc=3199231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, for example, the [[Office for Human Research Protections]] often promotes a traditional system wherein data which could identify a participant is coded, and then elsewhere stored away from the data is key which could decipher the identities in special circumstances when required outside of usual research.&lt;ref name="underpinnings"/&gt;

Complications arise in many situations, such as when the identity of the donor is released anyway or when the researchers want to contact the donor of the sample.&lt;ref name="whoowns"/&gt; Donor identities could become known if the data and decipher key are unsecure, but more likely, with rich datasets the identities of donors could be determined only from a few pieces of information which were thought unrelated to disturbing anonymity before the advent of computer communication.&lt;ref name="underpinnings"/&gt;

Among the concerns which participants in biobanks have expressed are giving personal information to researchers and having data used against them somehow.&lt;ref name="Public Opinion"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Murphy-Bollinger | first2 = J. | last3 = Scott | first3 = J. | last4 = Hudson | first4 = K.

Scientists have demonstrated that in many cases where participants' names were removed from data, the data still contained enough information to make identification of the participants possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ohm|first=Paul|title=Broken Promises of Privacy: Responding to the Surprising Failure of Anonymization|journal=UCLA Law Review|date=17 August 2009|volume=57|pages=1701|ssrn=1450006|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the historical methods of protecting confidentiality and anonymity have become obsolete when radically more detailed databases became available.&lt;ref name ="underpinnings"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Greely | first1 = H.

There have been problems deciding what safeguards should be in place for storing medical research data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Gostin | first2 = L. O. | doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.958 | title = Ethical Collection, Storage, and Use of Public Health Data: A Proposal for a National Privacy Protection | journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 302 | issue = 1 | pages = 82–4 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19567443| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, some researchers have made efforts to describe what constitutes sufficient security and to recognize what seemingly anonymized information can be used to identify donors.&lt;ref name="identifiability"/&gt;

==Ownership of specimens==
When a person donates a specimen to a researcher, it is not easy to describe what the participant is donating because ownership of the specimen represents more rights than physical control over the specimen.&lt;ref name="whoowns"/&gt;

The specimens themselves have commercial value, and research products made from specimens can also.  Fundamental research benefits all sectors, including government, non-profit, and commercial, and these sectors will not benefit equally.  Specimens may be subject to [[biological patent]]ing or research results from specimen experimentation may lead to the development of products which some entity will own.  The extent to which a specimen donor should be able to restrict the way their specimen is used is a matter of debate.&lt;ref name="whoowns"/&gt;

Some researchers make the argument that the specimens and data should be publicly owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rodwin | first1 = M. A. | doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.965 | title = The Case for Public Ownership of Patient Data | journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 302 | issue = 1 | pages = 86–8 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19567445| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers say that by calling for donations and branding the process as altruistic the entities organizing biobank research are circumventing difficult ethical questions which participants and researchers ought to address.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Andreas Brekke | first1 = O. | last2 = Sirnes | first2 = T. | doi = 10.1017/S1745855206004029 | title = Population Biobanks: The Ethical Gravity of Informed Consent | journal = BioSocieties | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 385–398 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return of results==
{{Main|Return of results}}

There is broad consensus that participants in clinical research have a right to know the results of a study in which they participated so that they can check the extent to which their participation delivered beneficial results to their community. The right to justice in the [[Belmont Report]] is a part of this idea.&lt;ref name="whoowns"/&gt; Despite the consensus that researchers should return some information to communities, there is no universally recognized authoritative policy on how researchers should return results to communities, and the views and practices of researchers in the field vary widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Haga | first1 = S. | last2 = Beskow | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2660(07)00418-X | chapter = Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications of Biobanks for Genetics Research | title = Genetic Dissection of Complex Traits | series = Advances in Genetics | volume = 60 | pages = 505–544 | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780123738837 | pmid = 18358331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning results can be problematic for many reasons, such as increased difficulty of tracking participants who donated a sample as time passes, the conflict with the participant's right to privacy, the inability of researchers to meaningfully explain scientific results to participants, general disinterest of participants to study results, and deciding what constitutes a return of results.&lt;ref name="whoowns"/&gt;

If genetic testing is done, then researches may get health information about participants, but in many cases there is no plan in place for giving participants information derived from their samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Avard | first1 = D. | last2 = Knoppers | first2 = B. | doi = 10.1186/gm25 | title = Genomic medicine: Considerations for health professionals and the public | journal = Genome Medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 25 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19341496| pmc =2664958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informed consent==
{{main|Informed consent}}
Because donating a specimen involves consideration of many issues, different people will have different levels of understanding of what they are doing when they donate a specimen.  Since it is difficult to explain every issue to everyone, problems of giving informed consent arise when researchers take samples.&lt;ref name="whoowns"/&gt;

A special informed consent problem happened historically with biobanks. Previous to the advent of biobanks, researchers would ask specimen donors for consent to participate in a single study, and give participants information about that study. In a biobank system, a researcher may have many specimens collected over many years and then long after the donors gave the sample, that researcher may want to conduct a new study using those samples but have no good way to give donors information about that study and collect their consent. This problem was first identified in widespread publication in 1995&lt;ref name="underpinnings"/&gt; when an article on this topic was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clayton | first1 = E. W. | last2 = Steinberg | first2 = K. K. | last3 = Khoury | first3 = M. J. | last4 = Thomson | first4 = E. | last5 = Andrews | first5 = L. | last6 = Kahn | first6 = M. J. | last7 = Kopelman | first7 = L. M. | last8 = Weiss | first8 = J. O. | title = Informed consent for genetic research on stored tissue samples | journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 274 | issue = 22 | pages = 1786–1792 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7500511 | doi=10.1001/jama.274.22.1786| citeseerx = 10.1.1.465.863 }} This is the article which first discussed the issue&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people have the opportunity to donate samples to medical research in the course of their regular medical care, but there are ethical problems in having one's own doctor request specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lurie | first1 = N. | last2 = Fremont | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1001/jama.2009.959 | title = Building Bridges Between Medical Care and Public Health | journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 302 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–86 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19567444| pmc = 3747986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers support biobanking despite risk to participants because the benefit is high, it pays respect to people's wishes to involve themselves in research, current practices and culture support this kind of research, and consensus is that the risk of participation is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hofmann | first1 = B. | title = Broadening consent--and diluting ethics? | doi = 10.1136/jme.2008.024851 | journal = Journal of Medical Ethics | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–129 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19181887| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donors to biobanks frequently do not have a good understanding of the concept of a biobank or the implications of donating a specimen to one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Barr | first1 = M. | title = 'I'm not Really Read up on Genetics': Biobanks and the Social Context of Informed Consent | doi = 10.1017/S1745855206060029 | journal = BioSocieties | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 251–262 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cipriano Targioni''' (1672&amp;ndash;1748) was an [[Italy|Italian]] scientific instrument maker.

Born in [[Florence]], Targioni studied [[medicine]] at the [[University of Pisa]]. On returning to his native town, he was named supervisor of the observations and physical experiments carried out in the [[Galleria Medicea]] by order of the [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]], [[Cosimo III de' Medici]]. He developed methods for preserving animal corpses for anatomical dissection. Targioni also conducted meteorological observations on a systematic basis beginning in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;Dechambre, Amédée.

'''The context-based model of the counterintuitiveness effect''' &lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2010). "An Alternative View of the Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect", ''Journal of Cognitive Systems Research'', 11(2), 194-203.&lt;/ref&gt; is a cognitive model of [[The Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect]] (or MCI-effect for short) i.e., the finding by many cognitive scientists of religion that minimally counterintuitive concepts are more memorable for people than intuitive and maximally counterintuitive concepts &lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal. ''The Naturalness of Religious Ideas'' University of California Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, P., &amp; Ramble, C. (2001). "Cognitive templates for religious concepts". ''Cognitive Science'', 25, 535–564.&lt;/ref&gt; The context-based model emphasizes the role played by the context in which a concept appears in making it counterintuitive. This is in contrast to the traditional (also called ''content-based'') accounts of the MCI-effect which underscore the role played by context.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. L., &amp; Nyhof, M. (2001). "Spreading non-natural concepts: the role of intuitive conceptual structures in memory and transmission of cultural materials". Journal of Cognition and Culture, 1, 69–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. L. (2008) Coding and Quantifying Counterintuitiveness in religious concepts: Theoretical
and methodological reflections. Method and Theory in the Study of Religion, 20,308-338.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barrett &amp; Nyhoff (2001) claim that this is necessary in order to explain cross-cultural success of religious concepts.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although research on schemas and scripts suggests the possibility that incongruent concepts may be better remembered thus contributing to their transmission, these conceptual structures are culturally variable to a large extent and will not provide an explanation for cross-culturally prevalent classes of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. L., &amp; Nyhof, M. (2001). "Spreading non-natural concepts: the role of intuitive conceptual structures in memory and transmission of cultural materials". Journal of Cognition and Culture, 1, 69–100.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The context-based model was first proposed by cognitive scientist [[Afzal Upal]] in 2005 &lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2005). Role of context in memorability of intuitive and counterintuitive concepts. In B. Bara, L.
Barsalou, &amp; M. Bucciarelli (Eds.). Proceedings of the 27th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 2224–2229). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been subsequently elaborated in a number of publications.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Upal, L. Gonce, R. Tweney, and J. Slone (2007) Contextualizing counterintuitiveness: How context affects comprehension and memorability of counterintuitive concepts, Cognitive Science, 31(3), 415-439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2011) From Individual to Social Counterintuitiveness: How layers of innovation weave together to form tapestries of human cultures, Mind and Society, 10(1), 79-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the context-based model, counterintuitiveness of a concept depends on the mental knowledge activated in the mind of a reader at the time at which the reader processes the concept in question.  Since this mental knowledge clearly varies from person to person, a concept that is counterintuitive to one person may not be so for another person.  Furthermore, a concept may be counterintuitive to a person at one time but not at another time.  In fact the context-based model predicts that since people learn, their conceptual representations change over time.  When people encounter a minimally counterintuitive concept for the first time, they are forced to make sense out of it (Upal (2005) labelled it as the ''postdiction'' process).  The postdiction process results in the formation of new knowledge structures and in strengthening of existing knowledge structures.  Because of these new knowledge structures, when the same concept is encountered again, it does not seem as counterintuitive as it did in the past.  The context-based model predicts that over time the counterintuitive concepts come to lose their very counterintuitiveness (and the memory advantages it confers upon the concept).

'''Davorin Dolar''' (January 1, 1921 – November 12, 2005) was a [[Slovenia]]n [[chemist]] at the [[University of Ljubljana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fkkt.uni-lj.si/en/?598 |title=Two professors at the Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology awarded Zois awards for 2004 |publisher=University of Ljubljana |accessdate=2013-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425053114/http://www.fkkt.uni-lj.si/en/?598 |archivedate=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Physical chemistry|physical chemist]] who studied [[polyelectrolyte]] solutions. He is regarded as a founder of modern physical chemistry teaching in Slovenia.&lt;ref name="in memory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fkkt.uni-lj.si/en/?822 |title=In Memory of the Academician, Prof. Dr. Davorin Dolar (1921-2005) |publisher=University of Ljubljana |accessdate=2013-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714020421/http://www.fkkt.uni-lj.si/en/?822 |archivedate=July 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a member of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

==Education and career==
In 1939 Dolar began studying chemistry at the University of Ljubljana and then graduated in 1944. In 1947 he enrolled at the University of Leningrad and continued studying physical chemistry. In 1952 he became an assistant professor of physical chemistry in Ljubljana. In 1954 he moved to Brooklyn to work under Professor Greogr{{clarify|date=July 2015}} at the Polytechnic Institute. In 1957, after returning to Ljubljana, he obtained his PhD. He was appointed an associate professor in 1960, and a professor in 1965. In 1960, while working at the Chair in Physical Chemistry, he started doing research in thermodynamic and transport properties of polyelectrolytic solutions, eventually gaining notability in the field. In 1978 he became a full member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He received the Boris Kidrič Award in 1979 and the Order of Slovenia in 1988. After retiring from Ljubljana in 1989, he was named a professor emeritus and received a golden plaque from the university in 1993. In 2004, he received the Zois Award for Lifetime Achievement.&lt;ref name="in memory"/&gt;

==Personal life==
When deciding what to study at the university, Dolar was torn between mathematics, physics, and chemistry.&lt;ref name="acta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acta.chem-soc.si/53/Mem-Dolar.pdf |title=In Memory of the Academician, Prof. Dr. Davorin Dolar (1921 – 2005) |publisher=Acta Chimica Slovenica |accessdate=2013-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716191454/http://acta.chem-soc.si/53/Mem-Dolar.pdf |archivedate=July 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended up choosing chemistry because he wanted to stay near the mountains and there was a factory nearby in need of chemical engineers. Known in his prime as a master mountain climber and mountain rescuer, he continued to hike his entire life.

His father was Simon Dolar, a popular mathematics professor, who was responsible for inspiring Davorin's love of the sciences.&lt;ref name="acta"/&gt;
From his retirement in 1989 to his death in 2005, Dolar remained highly active in the academic community, continuing to advise aspiring chemists until the end of his life.&lt;ref name="acta"/&gt;

[[Disease]]s, both real and fictional, play a significant role in fiction, with certain diseases like [[Huntington's disease in popular culture|Huntington's disease]] and [[Tuberculosis in human culture|tuberculosis]] appearing in many books and films. [[Pandemic]] plagues threatening all human life, such as ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'', are among the many [[List of fictional diseases|fictional diseases]] described in literature and film.

Genuine plagues have formed the central elements of books from [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s c. 1353 ''[[The Decameron]]'' onwards. Bocaccio tells the tales of ten people of Florence who escape from the [[Black Death]] in their city. The book inspired [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s 14th century ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', which similarly tells the stories of people on pilgrimage in a time of plague.&lt;ref name="Dugdale2014"/&gt; [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s 1957 film ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' ({{lang-sv|Det sjunde inseglet}}) is set in Denmark during the Black Death, and features a game of chess with [[Death (personification)|Death]] personified as a monk-like figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bragg |first=Melvyn |authorlink=Melvyn Bragg |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oahZAAAAMAAJ |title=The Seventh Seal (Det Sjunde Inseglet) |publisher=BFI Publishing |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tuberculosis]] was a common disease in the 19th century, and it appeared in several major works of [[Russian literature]]. [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] used the theme of the consumptive [[nihilist]] repeatedly, with Katerina Ivanovna in ''[[Crime and Punishment]]''; Kirillov in ''[[The Possessed (novel)|The Possessed]]'', and both Ippolit and Marie in ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]].'' [[Turgenev]] did the same with Bazarov in ''[[Father and Sons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor |first=Terry |title=Tuberculosis:Overview |work=International Encyclopedia of Public Health |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAnpCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA6-PA241 |year=2016 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-803708-9 |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[English literature]] of the [[Victorian era]], major tuberculosis novels include [[Charles Dickens]]'s 1848 ''[[Dombey and Son]]'', [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s 1855 ''[[North and South (Gaskell novel)|North and South]]'', and [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mrs. Humphry Ward]]'s 1900 ''Eleanor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawlor|first1=Clark|title=Katherine Byrne, Tuberculosis and the Victorian Literary Imagination|url=http://www.bsls.ac.uk/reviews/romantic-and-victorian/katherine-byrne-tuberculosis-and-the-victorian-literary-imagination/|publisher=British Society for Literature and Science |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Byrne, Katherine |title=Tuberculosis and the Victorian Literary Imagination |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-107-67280-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Camus]]'s 1947 ''[[The Plague]]'', probably based on [[cholera]] in 19th century France, was seen both as fable about the need for people to help each other in the meaningless world seen by [[existentialism]], and as alluding to the German invasion of France, fresh in Camus's mind.&lt;ref name="Dugdale2014"/&gt;

[[Huntington's disease]] appears [[Huntington's disease in popular culture#Books|in many novels]], such as  [[Ian McEwan]]'s 2005 ''[[Saturday (novel)|Saturday]]''. It was criticised as prejudiced in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' for its negative portrayal of the protagonist with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Prejudice in a portrayal of Huntington's disease | author=Nancy S Wexler and Michael D Rawlins | url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673605674053/ | journal=The Lancet | volume=366 | year=2005 | issue=9491 | pages=1069–1070 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67405-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decision making ==

Eisenhardt &amp; Bourgeois (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhardt, K. M., &amp; Bourgeois III, L. J. 1988. Politics of decision making in high velocity environments: Towards a midrange theory. Academy of Management Journal, 31(4): 737-770.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the concept of environmental velocity when studying strategic decision making in the micro-computer industry. They argued that this particular industry could be characterized as having a high-velocity environment, because it exhibited rapid and discontinuous change in demand, competition, technology and regulations. In a number of subsequent studies, it has been determined that success in high-velocity environments is related to fast, formal strategic decision-making processes&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhardt, K. M. 1989. Making fast strategic decisions in high-velocity environments. Academy of Management Journal, 32(3): 543-576.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhardt, K. M., &amp; Bourgeois III, L. J. 1988. Politics of decision making in high velocity environments: Towards a midrange theory. Academy of Management Journal, 31(4): 737-770.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judge, W. Q., &amp; Miller, A. 1991. Antecedents and outcomes of decision speed in different environmental contexts. Academy of Management Journal, 34(2): 449-463.&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of heuristic reasoning processes.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, D., &amp; Roos, J. 2005. Decision making in high-velocity environments: The importance of guiding principles. Organization Studies, 26(6): 889-913.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Innovation and organizational change ==
In line with [[contingency theory]], an organization’s environmental velocity dictates the rate at which high performing organizations should adapt. In a study that examined the link between [[product innovation]] and [[change management|organizational change]], Eisenhardt and Tabrizi (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhardt, K. M., &amp; Tabrizi, B. N. 1995. Accelerating adaptive processes: Product innovation in the global computer industry. Administrative Science Quarterly, 40(1): 84-110.&lt;/ref&gt; show that rapid product development facilitates fast organizational change and thus gives firms the capability to keep pace with fast changing environments. Similarly, it has been found that the management of multiple-product innovation projects by firms induces improvisation and experimentation behaviors within these firms.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, S. L., &amp; Eisenhardt, K. M. 1997. The art of continuous change: Linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations. Administrative Science Quarterly, 42(1): 1-34.&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors help firms to consistently succeed in high-velocity environments.

== Cognition ==
In the context of environmental velocity, research has examined the link between firm collective [[cognition]] and perceived environmental velocity. That is, how do the collective beliefs and associated practices of a firm shape how members of the firm perceive the velocity conditions of the environment? In a study of firms in the aircraft and semiconductor industries, it was found that environmental velocity is not simply an external and objective condition to which firms react; rather, firms collectively construct their environmental velocity through their [[social networks]], collective assumptions, and [[environmental scanning]] approaches (Nadkarni and Narayanan, 2007). Furthermore, firms should employ adaptive scanning and [[sensemaking]] approaches to effectively understand and deal with the dynamism in high-velocity environments.&lt;ref&gt;Bogner, W. C., &amp; Barr, P. S. 2000. Making sense in hypercompetitive environments: A cognitive explanation for the persistence of high velocity competition. Organization Science, 11(2): 212–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Velocity regimes ==
In a key review of some of the major studies in this area, McCarthy et al. (2010)&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, I.P., Lawrence, T.B., Wixted, B., and Gordon, B. 2010. A Multidimensional conceptualization of environmental velocity. Academy of Management Review, 35(4), 604-626 &lt;/ref&gt; found that researchers and managers often focus on the rate or speed of change only, treating velocity as a single, latent aspect of the environment, characterized simply as being “high” or “low”. However, the original definition of environmental velocity (Eisenhardt and Bourgeois 1988)&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhardt, K. M., &amp; Bourgeois III, L. J. 1988. Politics of decision making in high velocity environments: Towards a midrange theory. Academy of Management Journal, 31(4): 737-770.&lt;/ref&gt; defines and describes it as a vector quality, composed of both rate and direction of change across multiple dimensions (e.g., regulations, demand, product, technology, and competition).

McCarthy et al. (2010)&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, I.P., Lawrence, T.B., Wixted, B., and Gordon, B. 2010. A Multidimensional conceptualization of environmental velocity. Academy of Management Review, 35(4), 604-626 &lt;/ref&gt; developed a framework that describes the relationships between these multiple velocity dimensions, noting that they may each have a distinct and often different velocity. They define “velocity homology” as the degree to which velocity dimensions have similar rates and directions of change and “velocity coupling” as the degree to which the velocities of different dimensions affect one another. This multidimensional treatment of environmental velocity results in four “velocity regimes” - simple, divergent, conflicted and integrated - based on the patterns of velocity homology and velocity coupling. A key implication of the framework is that firms should not necessarily focus on being uniformly fast (or slow) to suit industry conditions. Each of the four velocity regimes requires firms to maintain different forms of temporal fit (i.e., the [[Entrainment (physics)|entrainment]] of multiple organizational paces) and temporal coordination (i.e., managing the interdependences between organizational paces).

== Temporal orientations ==
McCarthy et al. (2010)&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, I.P., Lawrence, T.B., Wixted, B., and Gordon, B. 2010. A Multidimensional conceptualization of environmental velocity. Academy of Management Review, 35(4), 604-626 &lt;/ref&gt; explain that each of the velocity regimes they propose is suited to a different temporal orientation, which they define as “how individuals and teams conceive of time". Specially, they argue that when velocity dimensions are tightly coupled to each (i.e., “the relationship between the velocities of different dimensions involve significant immediate, direct causal effects”), an organization’s capabilities would benefit from a [[Chronemics|polychronic]] orientation. In contrast, when velocity regimes are loosely coupled (i.e., “changes in the velocity of one dimension have relatively little immediate, direct impact on the velocities of other dimensions”) an organization’s capabilities would benefit from a [[Chronemics|monochronic]] orientation.

An '''equatorial mount''' is a mount for instruments that compensates for [[Earth's rotation]] by having one rotational axis parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.astrogea.org/soldevilla/las_monturas.htm | title = LAS MONTURAS | publisher = Observatorio J. A. Soldevilla}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oarval.org/LXD55PolAlign.htm | title = Observatorio ARVAL - Polar Alignment for Meade LXD55/75 Autostar telescopes | publisher = Observatorio ARVAL}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of mount is used for astronomical [[telescope mount|telescopes]] and [[camera]]s. The advantage of an equatorial mount lies in its ability to allow the instrument attached to it to stay fixed on any [[celestial object]] with [[diurnal motion]] by driving one axis at a constant speed. Such an arrangement is called a sidereal or [[clock drive]].

[[File:Equatorial mount principle.svg|thumb|90px|The green equatorially mounted telescope rotates at the same rate as the earth but in the opposite direction, while the red telescope is not driven.]]

==Astronomical telescope mounts==
In astronomical [[telescope mount]]s, the equatorial axis (the ''[[right ascension]]'') is paired with a second [[perpendicular]] [[coordinate axis|axis]] of motion (known as the ''[[declination]]''). The equatorial axis of the mount is often equipped with a motorized "''[[clock drive]]''", that rotates that axis one revolution every 23 hours and 56 minutes in exact sync with the apparent diurnal motion of the sky.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PexKTfPy3voC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=%22called+a+clock+drive%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=etnITMabMIH_8Aa8v8StDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22called%20a%20clock%20drive%22&amp;f=false Turn left at Orion: a hundred night sky objects to see in a small telescope ...  By Guy Consolmagno, Dan M. Davis, Karen Kotash Sepp, Anne Drogin, Mary Lynn Skirvin, page 204]&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be equipped with [[setting circles]] to allow for the location of objects by their [[celestial coordinates]]. Equatorial mounts differ from mechanically simpler [[altazimuth mount]]s, which require variable speed motion around both axes to track a fixed object in the sky. Also, for [[astrophotography]], the image does not rotate in the [[focal plane]], as occurs with altazimuth mounts when they are guided to track the target's motion, unless a rotating erector prism or other field-derotator is installed.

Equatorial telescope mounts come in many designs. In the last twenty years motorized tracking has increasingly been supplemented with computerized object location. There are two main types. Digital setting circles take a small computer with an object database that is attached to encoders. The computer monitors the telescope's position in the sky.  The operator must push the telescope. Go-to systems use (in most cases) servo motors and the operator need not touch the instrument at all to change its position in the sky. The computers in these systems are typically either hand-held in a control "paddle" or supplied through an adjacent laptop computer which is also used to capture images from an electronic camera. The electronics of modern telescope systems often include a port for autoguiding.  A special instrument tracks a star and makes adjustment in the telescope's position while photographing the sky.  To do so the autoguider must be able to issue commands through the telescope's control system.  These commands can compensate for very slight errors in the tracking performance, such as periodic error caused by the worm drive that makes the telescope move.

In new observatory designs, equatorial mounts have been out of favor for decades in large-scale professional applications.  Massive new instruments are most stable when mounted in an alt-azimuth (up down, side-to-side) configuration.  Computerized tracking and field-derotation are not difficult to implement at the professional level. At the amateur level, however, equatorial mounts remain popular, particularly for astrophotography.

=== German equatorial mount === &lt;!-- If changing this heading please adjust redirect at [[German equatorial mount]] to suit --&gt;
[[File:Maksutov-Cassegrain Intes M703 mounted.jpg|thumb|right|100px|German equatorial mount]]
In the '''German equatorial mount''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathis-instruments.com/fork_german.html |title=German and Fork Equatorial Mounts |publisher=2002-2007 Mathis-Instruments |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102184846/http://mathis-instruments.com/fork_german.html |archivedate=2009-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes called a "'''GEM'''" for short) the primary structure is a '''T'''-shape, where the lower bar is the ''right ascension'' axis (lower diagonal axis in image), and the upper bar is the ''declination'' axis (upper diagonal axis in image). The mount was developed by Joseph von Fraunhofer for the Great Dorpat Refractor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kX_DAEsOWssC&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Firefly Astronomy Dictionary |publisher=Firefly Books Ltd. 2003 |deadurl=no|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that was finished in 1824. The telescope is placed on one end of the declination axis (top left in image), and a suitable counterweight on other end of it (bottom right). The right ascension axis has bearings below the T-joint, that is, it is not supported above the declination axis.

=== Open fork mount ===
[[Image:Warszawskie Obserwatorium Południowe Teleskop.jpg|thumb|left|75px|Open fork mount]]
The '''Open Fork''' mount has a ''Fork'' attached to a right ascension axis at its base. The telescope is attached to two pivot points at the other end of the fork so it can swing in declination. Most modern mass-produced [[catadioptric]] reflecting telescopes (200&amp;nbsp;mm or larger diameter) tend to be of this type.  The mount resembles an [[Altazimuth mount]], but with the azimuth axis tilted and lined up to match earth rotation axis with a piece of hardware usually called a "wedge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.universetoday.com/guide-to-space/telescopes/telescope-mount/ | title = Telescope Mount | publisher = [[Universe Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mid-size professional telescopes also have ''equatorial forks'', these are usually in range of 0.5-2.0 meter diameter.

=== English or Yoke mount ===
[[Image:100inchHooker.jpg|thumb|right|75px|English mount on the [[Mount Wilson Observatory#100 inch (2.5 m) Hooker Telescope|Hooker telescope]]]]
The '''English mount''' or '''Yoke''' mount&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/museum/esim.asp?c=202501 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100808021549/http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/museum/esim.asp?c=202501 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-08-08 |title=IMSS - Multimedia Catalogue - Glossary - Telescope mounts |publisher=1995-2006 IMSS  Piazza dei Giudici 1  50122 Florence   ITALY }}&lt;/ref&gt; has a frame or "''yoke''" with ''right ascension'' axis bearings at the top and the bottom ends, and a telescope attached inside the midpoint of the yoke allowing it to swing on the ''declination'' axis. The telescope is usually fitted entirely inside the fork, although there are exceptions such as the [[Mount Wilson Observatory|Mt. Wilson 2.5 m reflector]], and there are no counterweights as with the ''German mount''.

The original ''English fork'' design is disadvantaged in that it does not allow the telescope to point too near the north or south celestial pole.

===Horseshoe mount===
[[File:Palomar arp 600pix.jpg|thumbnail|left|120px|Horseshoe mount on the Hale telescope]]
The '''Horseshoe mount''' overcomes the design disadvantage of English or Yoke  mounts by replacing the polar bearing with an open "horseshoe" structure to allow the telescope to access Polaris and stars near it. The [[Hale telescope]] is the most prominent example of a Horseshoe mount in use.&lt;ref name="savard"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.quadibloc.com/science/opt03.htm | title = Telescope Mountings | publisher = 2001, 2004 John J. G. Savard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-axis mount===
[[Image:Zeiss di Merate - incrocio assi.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Cross-axis mount.]]
The '''Cross-axis'''&lt;ref name="savard" /&gt; or '''English cross axis''' mount is like a big "plus" sign ('''+'''). The ''right ascension'' axis is supported at both ends, and the ''declination'' axis is attached to it at approximately midpoint with the telescope on one end of the declination axis and a counter weight on the other.

===Equatorial platform===
{{main|Equatorial platform}}
An '''[[equatorial platform]]''' is a specially designed platform that allows any device sitting on it to track on an equatorial axis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2lIwU313wgkC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=equatorial+platform&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6k5-TZGVK6uI0QG57sDXAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=equatorial%20platform&amp;f=false  Philip S. Harrington, Star Ware: The Amateur Astronomer's Guide to Choosing, Buying, and Using Telescopes and Accessories, page 168]&lt;/ref&gt; It achieves this by having a surface that pivots about a "virtual polar axis". This gives equatorial tracking to anything sitting on the platform, from small cameras up to entire observatory buildings. These platforms are often used with [[altazimuth mount]]ed [[Amateur astronomy|amateur astronomical]] telescopes, such as the common [[Dobsonian telescope]] type, to overcome that type of mount's inability to track the night sky.

'''Functional zoning''' or functional city [[zoning]] is a method used for dividing [[land use]] by its function.&lt;ref name="Dubrova, Podlipskiy,Kurilenko, Siabato"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270002179_Functional_city_zoning_Environmental_assessment_of_eco-geological_substance_migration_flows|title=Functional city zoning.

'''Gemini spacecraft No. 2''' (officially known as "'''Gemini SC-2'''", for "space capsule 2") was the second NASA [[Project Gemini]] full-up [[space capsule]] built. This [[McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell]] Gemini capsule was the first ever [[spacecraft]] to be reused, flying twice into suborbital space. No.2 flew on missions [[Gemini-Titan 2]] and [[Gemini-B|Manned Orbiting Laboratory Gemini-B]] flight. The capsule is currently on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], in [[Washington, D.C.]].

==Spacecraft history==
The capsule is part of the collection of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name= NMUSAF-GeminiSpacecraft/&gt;

On 19 January 1965, the Gemini-Titan 2 suborbital test mission was launched, with the second prototype Gemini capsule.&lt;ref name=USAFSMM-GeminiCapsule/&gt;&lt;ref name= HSS-1996-09&gt;{{cite magazine |url= http://www.space1.com/pdf/news1096.pdf |title= Gemini-B: NASA-Gemini’s Air Force Twin |magazine= Historic Space Systems Infosheet |publisher= Historic Space Systems |number= 1 |date= September 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1965, NASA approved the transfer of the Gemini 2 capsule to the USAF for modification into the first prototype of the Gemini B capsule.&lt;ref name=PopSci-2015-11-03&gt;{{cite magazine |url= https://www.popsci.com/manned-orbiting-laboratory-air-force-failed-to-launch |title= The Manned Orbiting Laboratory the Air Force Failed to Launch |date= 3 November 2015 |author= Amy Shira Teitel |publisher= Popular Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 1965, the first [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL) and Gemini B suborbital test mission was launched.&lt;ref name=PopSci-2015-11-03/&gt; Thus, it became the only Mercury, Gemini, or Apollo, capsule to be reflown,&lt;ref name=FloridaToday-2016-11-03&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2016/11/03/50-years-ago-air-force-mol-program-launched-only-mission/93122028/ |title= 50 years ago, Air Force 'MOL' program launched only mission |author= James Dean |publisher= Florida Today |date= 3 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first capsule to ever be space-reflown.&lt;ref name=OrlandoRising-2016-11-03&gt;{{cite news |url= http://orlando-rising.com/air-force-celebrates-50th-anniversary-of-gemini-launch/ |title= Air Force celebrates 50th anniversary of Gemini launch |author= Terry Roen |date= 3 November 2016 |publisher= Orlando Rising }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capsule was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution, as part of the National Air and Space Museum collection.&lt;ref name= NMUSAF-GeminiSpacecraft/&gt;

The capsule was put on display in the Allan and Malcolm Lockheed and Glenn Martin Space Gallery at the [[National Museum of the USAF]] in 2016.&lt;ref name= NMUSAF-GeminiSpacecraft&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/198109/gemini-spacecraft/ |title= Gemini Spacecraft |date= 4 April 2016 |publisher= National Museum of the U.S. Air Force |author= USAF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capsule was put on display in the exhibit hall of the [[Air Force Space and Missile Museum]] of the USAF in 2017.&lt;ref name=USAFSMM-GeminiCapsule&gt;{{cite web |url= http://afspacemuseum.org/displays/GeminiCapsule/ |title= Gemini Capsule |date= 2017 |publisher= Air Force Space and Missile Museum |author= USAF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vitis vinifera 2.jpg|220px|thumb|A bud of [[Vitis vinifera]], the Grape Vine]]
[[Image:Ilex 1.jpg|220px|thumb|Young shoots of [[Ilex aquifolium]], Holly]]
'''Gemmotherapy''' [from Lat. ''gemma'', bud, and New Lat. ''therapīa'', Grk. ''therapeia'', medical treatment] is a form of [[herbalism|herbal medicine]] that uses remedies made principally from the embryonic tissue of various [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s (the [[bud]]s and emerging [[shoots]]), but also from the reproductive parts (the [[seed]]s and [[catkin]]s) and from newly grown tissue (the [[root]]lets and the [[root#root structure|cortex]] of rootlets).  In two instances, remedies are also made from the [[plant sap|sap]].

This raw material is taken  at the peak time of the tree or shrub’s annual [[germination]], in the spring for buds or the autumn for seeds. Certain plant hormones and enzymes are released during this process, and in some cases are only present in the plant at this time.

== Development and spread of gemmotherapy ==

The therapeutic effects of remedies made from the embryonic material of plants were first investigated in the late 1950s by a Belgian homeopath, Pol Henry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uygAyfa5Au8C&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=pol%20henry%20Gemmotherapie&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q=pol%20henry |page=80 |title=Soigner le stress par l'homéopathie et la phytothérapie |author=Bernard Chemouny |publisher=Odile Jacob |date=2012 |isbn= 9782738178237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1918–88), working with a group of French [[homeopath]]s and biotherapists including Max Tétau (1927-2012) and O.A. Julian (1910–84). They conducted the first experiments as well as human and animal clinical trials that elucidated the effects of gemmotherapy and summarized their clinical findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bases Biologiques de la Gemmothérapie|last = Henry|first = Pol|publisher = Saint-Norbert|year = 1959|isbn = |location = Tongerlo, Belgium|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Conception de la Gemmotherapie|last = Tétau|first = Max|date = January 1959|journal = Archives Homéopathiques de Normandie |issn=0518-3391 |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Observation clinique de Gemmotherapie|editor-last = Julian|editor-first = O.A.|date = January 1961|journal = Archives Homéopathiques de Normandie |doi = |pmid =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry initially called the new type of medicine, phytoembryotherapy, but it was Tetau that later coined the phrase gemmotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Treatise on Gemmotherapy|last = Andrianne|first = Philippe|publisher = Editions Amyris SPRL|year = 2012|isbn = 978-2-8755-2012-8|location = Brussels, Belgium|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gemmotherapy was included in herbal therapies in France in the ''Pharmacopée Francaise''&lt;ref&gt;''Pharmacopée Francaise'', 8th edition, Ministère de la Santé, Gouvernement Français, Paris 1965&lt;/ref&gt; in 1965.

'''Infologs''' are independently designed [[Artificial gene synthesis|synthetic genes]] derived from one or a few genes where substitutions are systematically incorporated to maximize information. Infologs are designed for perfect diversity distribution to maximize search efficiency.

Typical [[protein engineering]] methods rely on screening a high number (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; or more) of gene variants to identify individuals with improved activity using a surrogate high throughput screen (HTP) to identify initial hits.  Unfortunately, results are defined by what is screened for, thus the “hit” from the HTP screen often has very little real activity in a lower throughput assay more indicative of the improved functionality for which the protein is being developed. By adapting the standard algorithms for engineering complex systems to work with biological systems, the resulting process enables researchers to deconvolute how substitutions within a protein sequence modify its function. Combining these algorithms with an integrated query and ranking mechanism allows the identification of appropriate sequence substitutions.&lt;ref&gt;This technology is covered by [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=8,005,620.PN.&amp;OS=PN/8,005,620&amp;RS=PN/8,005,620 United States issued patent US 8,005,620]&lt;/ref&gt; Infologs refers to the set of designed genes, singular use Infolog describes an individual variant.

== Ancestry ==

[[Homology (biology)|Homology]] between protein or DNA sequences is defined in terms of shared ancestry. Two segments of DNA can have shared ancestry because of either a speciation event (orthologs) or a duplication event (paralogs).

Homologs are similar genes and/or proteins which are related by ancestry.

[[Homology (biology)#Orthology|Orthologs]] are the 'same' gene, but from different organisms. Homologous sequences are orthologous if they were separated by a speciation event: when a species diverges into two separate species, the copies of a single gene in the two resulting species are said to be orthologous. Orthologs, or orthologous genes, are genes in different species that originated by vertical descent from a single gene of the last common ancestor. The term "ortholog" was coined in 1970 by Walter Fitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Walter M. |last1=Fitch |year=1970 |title=Distinguishing Homologous from Analogous Proteins |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=99–113 |doi=10.2307/2412448 |jstor=2412448 |pmid=5449325}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
[[Homology (biology)#Paralogy|Paralogs]] are related genes originating from one gene that through duplication ended up as two genes that over time has evolved for two separate functions (or, according to a recent Science paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1226521 |title=Real-Time Evolution of New Genes by Innovation, Amplification, and Divergence |year=2012 |last1=Nasvall |first1=J. |last2=Sun |first2=L. |last3=Roth |first3=J. R. |last4=Andersson |first4=D. I. |journal=Science |volume=338 |issue=6105 |pages=384–7 |pmid=23087246|bibcode = 2012Sci...338..384N |pmc=4392837 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a promiscuous starting gene that duplicated and each copy evolved towards different functions). Paralogs typically have the same or similar function, but sometimes do not: due to lack of the original selective pressure upon one copy of the duplicated gene, this copy is free to mutate and acquire new functions. Paralogs usually occur from within the same species.
 
[[Homology (biology)#Xenology|Xenologs]] are homologs resulting from horizontal gene transfer between two organisms. Xenologs can have different functions, if the new environment is vastly different for the horizontally moving gene. In general, though, xenologs typically have similar function in both organisms.

'''Infologs''' are similar genes and/or proteins which are related by synthetic ancestry to approach perfect diversity distribution.

== Features ==

* Optimize directly for function in the final application
* Does not require high-throughput (HTP) screens
* Screen small numbers of variants (50-200) directly for the desired function
* Decreased false positives: variants identified by HTP screens that do not retain activity in 'real' assay
* Decreased loss of potential positive hits due to screening error or poor correlation between HTP screen and 'real' assay
* No biodiversity collections required, everything is synthesized as needed
* Sequence-function relationships provide the basis for strong composition-of-matter patent claims.

'''Transforming Protein engineering with Infologs:'''

Using independently designed [[Artificial gene synthesis|synthetic genes]] where substitutions are systematically incorporated (Infologs) leads to uniform sampling, systematic variance and unrestricted information rich results.  Wheat [[Glutathione S-transferase]]s (GST) with the ability to detoxify a panel of common herbicides was designed using this patented bioengineering method. The relative functional contribution of 60 amino acid substitutions against 14 herbicides was quantified using only 96 Infologs and dramatically improved by a small set (16) of 2nd generation Infologs. In addition, highly predictable GST sequence-function models against two commercially relevant herbicides were created with quantification of relative functional contribution of 60 amino acid substitutions in two dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dna20.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/EnzEngrXXI_2011_Final.pdf Enzyme Engineering Conference Presentation: "Using Infologs to Engineer Biological Systems" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rational design of proteins ==

{{main|Protein design}}

In rational protein design, the scientist uses detailed knowledge of the structure and function of the protein to make desired changes. This generally has the advantage of being technically easy and inexspensive, since [[site-directed mutagenesis]] techniques are well-developed. However, its major drawback is that detailed structural knowledge of a protein is often unavailable, and even when it is available, it can be extremely difficult to predict the effects of various mutations.

Computational protein design [[algorithms]] seek to identify novel amino acid sequences that are low in energy when folded to the pre-specified target structure. While the sequence-conformation space that needs to be searched is large, the most challenging requirement for computational protein design is a fast, yet accurate, energy function that can distinguish optimal sequences from similar suboptimal ones.

Millikan]] among its members.{{Sfn |Pernet|2014}}{{Sfn |Grandjean|2016a}}{{Sfn |Grandjean|2014b}} The Committee was the predecessor to [[UNESCO]], and all of its properties were transferred to that organisation in 1946.

==The International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (Geneva)==
The International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (CICI) was formally established in August 1922.{{Sfn |Grandjean|2017}} Having started out with 12 members, its membership later grew to 19 individuals. The first session was held on August 1st 1922, under the chairmanship of [[Henri Bergson]]. During its lifetime, the committee attracted a variety of prominent members, for instance [[Albert Einstein]], [[Marie Curie]], [[Kristine Bonnevie]], [[Jules Destrée]], [[Robert Andrews Millikan]], [[Alfredo Rocco]], [[Paul Painlevé]], [[Gonzague de Reynold]], [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]]. Einstein resigned in 1923, protesting publicly the committee's inefficacy; he rejoined in 1924 to mitigate the use German chauvinists made of his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein, ''Ideas and Opinions'' (New York: Bonanza/Crown, 1954), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The body was successively chaired by:
* [[Henri Bergson]] (1922–1925)
* [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1925–1928)
* [[Gilbert Murray]] (1928–1939).
The CICI maintained a number of sub-committees (e.g. Museums, Arts and Letters, Intellectual Rights or Bibliography) which also worked with figures such as [[Béla Bartók]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Salvador de Madariaga]] and [[Paul Valéry]].

The CICI worked closely with the International Educational Cinematographic Institute created in Rome in 1928 by the [[Italian government]] under [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]].

The last session took place in 1939, but the CICI was only formally dissolved in 1946, like the League of Nations.

==The International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation (Paris)==
[[File:Sap01 mh0092807 p - IMG 20140526 1501390000.tif|thumb|A side of the [[Palais-Royal]] ([[Paris]]), where the IIIC was installed in 1926.]]In order to support the work of the commission in [[Geneva]], the organization was offered assistance from France to establish an executive branch, the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC), in Paris in 1926. However, the IIIC had an autonomous status and was almost only financed by the French Government. It maintained relations with the League's member states, which established national commissions for intellectual cooperation and appointed delegates to represent their interests at the Institute in Paris. While being an [[international organisation]], each of the IIIC's three successive directors was French:
* [[Julien Luchaire]] (1926–1930)
* [[Henri Bonnet]] (1931–1940)
* [[Jean-Jacques Mayoux]] (1945–1946)
From 1926 to 1930, [[Alfred Zimmern]] – the well-known British classicist and a pioneering figure in the discipline of international relations – served as the IIIC's Deputy Director. 

As a result of the Second World War, the Institute was closed from 1940 to 1944.  It re-opened briefly from 1945 to 1946.  When it closed for good in 1946, [[UNESCO]] inherited its archives and some parts of its mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atom.archives.unesco.org/ag-1-international-institute-of-intellectual-co-operation-iiic;isad?sf_culture=en|title=UNESCO Archives|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn |Renoliet|1999}}

[[File:Kaitai shinsyo01.jpg|thumb|A copy of ''Kaitai Shinsho'' at [[Tekijuku]]]]
{{nihongo|'''''Kaitai Shinsho'''''|解体新書||[[Wiktionary:Kyūjitai|Kyūjitai]]: {{lang|ja|解體新書}}, roughly meaning "New Text on Anatomy"}} is a medical text translated into [[Japanese language|Japanese]] during the [[Edo period]]. It is based on the [[Dutch language|Dutch-language]] translation ''Ontleedkundige Tafelen'', often known in Japan as {{nihongo|''Tafel Anatomie''|ターヘル・アナトミア|Tāheru Anatomia}}, of [[Johann Adam Kulm|Kulmus]]’ German ''Anatomische Tabellen''. As a full-blown translation from a [[Western culture|Western]] [[language]], it was the first of its kind in [[Japan]]. It was written by [[Sugita Genpaku]], and was published by Suharaya Ichibee ({{lang|ja|須原屋市兵衛}}) in 1774, the third year of [[An'ei]]. The body comprises four volumes, the illustrations, one. The contents are written [[kanbun]]-style.

==Background==
On 4 March 1771, the eighth year of [[Meiwa]], the students of [[Rangaku]] medicine [[Sugita Genpaku]], [[Maeno Ryōtaku]], [[Nakagawa Jun'an]], ''et al.'', by studying performing autopsies on criminals executed at the [[Kozukappara execution grounds]] (now, there is a possibility that [[Katsuragawa Hoshū]] was at this facility as well, but from the description in {{nihongo|''[[Rangaku Koto Hajime]]''|蘭学事始|}}, it seems more likely that he was not). Both Sugita and Maeno had the book ''Ontleedkundige Tafelen'', imported from [[Holland]]. Sugita, marveling at the accuracy of the work while comparing it by eye with his autopsies, proposed to Maeno that it be translated. For some time, Sugita had a desire to translate something from Dutch; now he would get approval for this. He met with Maeno the very next day (5 March) and began translation. The one who recommended ''Kaitai Shinsho'' to the ''[[shōgun]]'' was [[Katsuragawa Hosan]].

At first, Sugita and Nakagawa could not actually read [[Dutch language|Dutch]]; even with Maeno who could, their Dutch vocabulary was inadequate. It would have been difficult for them to consult with the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translations and translators ([[Tsūji]]) in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], and naturally there were no dictionaries at the time. A translation from any other Western language would have been out of the question, as the government of the time did not allow contact with any other Western nation. Therefore, in a process comparable to [[cryptanalysis]], they progressed with translation work. In his later years, Sugita would detail the process in ''Rangaku Koto Hajime''.

In the second year of [[An'ei]] (1773), as they arrived at a translation goal, in order to ascertain society’s response, they released the {{nihongo|"Anatomical Diagrams"|解体約図|Kaitai Yakuzu}}, a five-page flyer.

In 1774, ''Kaitai Shinsho'' was published.

==Influences==
Maeno Ryōtaku was at the center of the translation work, but there is not a name as to the author of the ''Kaitai Shinsho''. By one account, Maeno was on the way to study at Nagasaki; when he prayed at a [[Tenman-gū]] for the fulfillment of his studies, he vowed not to study in order to raise his own name, so he abstained from submitting it. By another account, since he knew that the completed works were not completely perfect, the academic Maeno could not submit his name in good conscience.  [[Sugita Genpaku]] said, "I am sickly and numbered in years as well. I do not know when I will die." While he knew the translation was imperfect in places, he rushed to publish. The publication of "Anatomic Illustrations" was also Sugita’s design; in regard to this, Maeno is said to have had shown dislike for it. However, the man would actually go on to live an extremely long life for the time (he lived to the age of eighty-five). Unsure of when he would die and unsure of whether the government would approve the distribution of the Western ideas, it could be said this was a risky but important move.

[[Nakagawa Jun'an]], after ''Kaitai Shinsho''’s publication, also continued his study of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], along with [[Katsuragawa Hoshū]], and took on the [[natural history]] of [[Sweden]] according to [[Carl Peter Thunberg|Thunberg]].  Katsuragawa Hosan was a same-generation friend of Sugita's. With his status as a [[hōgen (title)|hōgen]], he served as a [[court physician]] to the ''[[shōgun]]''. He was not a direct influence on the translation work itself, though his son Hoshū did participate. Also, he provided for the  supplementary materials that amounted to three volumes of [[Holland|Dutch]] medical texts. Upon the publishing of ''Kaitai Shinsho'', since there was a possibility that it encroached on the Bakufu’s taboos, Katsuragawa was the one who ran it by the [[Ōoku]].  [[Katsuragawa Hoshū]] was the son of the hōgen Katsuragawa Hosan, and would become a hōgen himself later on. He is said to have been involved with the translation work from early on. Afterwards, he would serve to develop [[rangaku]] along with [[Ōtsuki Gentaku]].

There are others that had to do with the translation work, like [[Ishikawa Genjō]], whose name appears in the opening pages, [[Toriyama Shōen]], &lt;!-- this reading of 鳥山松圓 may be completely off-base --&gt; [[Kiriyama Shōtetsu]], and [[Mine Shuntai]] (among others) whose names appear in ''Rangaku Koto Hajime''.  [[Yoshio Kōgyū]] (posthumously Yoshio Nagaaki) was a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] [[tsūji]]. He wrote the preface to ''Kaitai Shinsho'', and admired what he felt to be Sugita and Maeno’s masterpiece.  [[Hiraga Gennai]], on [[Japanese New Year|Shōgatsu]] of the third year of [[An'ei]], visited the home of Sugita Genpaku. The translation of ''Kaitai Shinsho''’s text was nearly complete, and he was informed that they were looking for an artist for the dissection figures.  [[Odano Naotake]] was a ''[[Samurai#Etymology of samurai and related words|bushi]]'' from [[Kakunodate]] in the [[Akita Domain]], and the artist. By [[Hiraga Gennai]]'s referral, he got to drawing ''Kaitai Shinsho''{{'}}s figures off the original pictures. Until ''Kaitai Shinsho''{{'}}s first edition, it took the short time of half a year. It was his first time working in Edo, and yet it was historical record-setting work for Japanese science.

==Content==
[[File:First Japanese treatise on Western anatomy.jpg|thumb|The ''Kaitai Shinsho'', published in 1774]]
[[File:Kaitai01.jpg|thumb|''Kaitai shinsho''. From the National Library of Medicine.]]
''Kaitai Shinsho'' is generally said to be a translation of ''Ontleedkundige Tafelen''. However, other than the work itself, &lt;!-- I can’t determine whose works these are! Help out if you are experienced in the field ;_; --&gt;[[Thomas Bartholin|Bartholini]]'s, [[Stephanus Blancardus|Blankaart]]'s, [[Caspar Schamberger|Schamberger]]’s, [[Volcher Coiter|Koyter]]’s, &lt;!--『[[アンブル外科書解体篇]]』, --&gt;[[Johann Vesling|Veslingius]]', [[Jan Palfijn|Palfijn]]'s, &lt;!-- [[バルシトス解体書]],『[[ミスケル解体書]]』,--&gt; and others' works were also consulted; the cover is based on [[Juan Valverde de Amusco|Valuerda]]'s. Of course, Asian sources and opinions also had an influence.

The book is not a mere translation; the translation was done mostly by doctors like Sugita, who had to decipher and reconstruct the contents. There are notes in various places left by Sugita, as leftovers from the work.

The contents are split into four volumes:

;Volume I
:General remarks; forms and [[name]]s; [[body plan|parts of the body]]; [[Skeleton|skeletal structure]]: general remarks about [[joint]]s; skeletal structure: detailed exposition about joints.
;Volume II
:The [[head]]; the [[mouth]]; the [[brain]] and [[nerve]]s; the [[eye]]s; the [[ear]]s; the [[human nose|nose]]; the [[tongue]].
;Volume III
:The [[chest]] and the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]; the [[lung]]s; the [[heart]]; [[artery|arteries]]; [[vein]]s; the [[hepatic portal vein|portal vein]]; the [[abdomen]]; the [[intestine|bowels]] and [[stomach]]; the [[mesentery]] and [[lacteal]]s; the [[pancreas]].
;Volume IV
:The [[spleen]]; the [[liver]] and [[gall bladder]]; the [[kidney]]s and the [[urinary bladder|bladder]]; the [[genitalia]]; [[pregnancy]]; the [[muscles]].

The illustrations only comprise one volume.

==Effect afterwards==
After the publication of the ''Kaitai Shinsho'', there was besides the development in medical science, the progress of the comprehension of the Dutch language. Also, it is important to note that Japan, even under its extreme isolationist policies, still had some foundation to understand the products of Western culture. It also helped to give a chance for promotion for such talents as those of Ōtsuki Gentaku.

In translation, some words had to be coined (that is, there were no Japanese words that existed for them prior to the work). Some of them, such as the terms for {{nihongo|"[[nerve]]"|神経|shinkei}}, {{nihongo|"[[cartilage]]"|軟骨|nankotsu}}, and {{nihongo|"[[artery]]"|動脈|dōmyaku}} are still used to this day as a result.

The fact that this was a first translation means that minor misunderstandings were practically unavoidable. There are many mistranslations in the ''Kaitai Shinsho''; later on, Ōtsuki Gentaku retranslated it and released the {{nihongo|''Authoritative and Revised New Text on Anatomy''|重訂解体新書|Chōtei Kaitai Shinsho}} in the ninth year of [[Bunsei]] (1826).

In his last years, Sugita Genpaku would write about the work on ''Kaitai Shinsho'' in {{nihongo|''The Beginnings of [[Rangaku]]''|蘭学事始|Rangaku Koto Hajime}}.

[[Image:Mandelpart2 red.png|right|thumb|upright=1.4|This image illustrates part of the [[Mandelbrot set]] [[fractal]]. Simply storing the 24-bit color of each pixel in this image would require 1.62 million bytes, but a small computer program can reproduce these 1.62 million bytes using the definition of the Mandelbrot set and the coordinates of the corners of the image. Thus, the Kolmogorov complexity of the raw file encoding this bitmap is much less than 1.62 million bytes in any pragmatic model of computation.]]

In [[algorithmic information theory]] (a subfield of [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]]), the '''Kolmogorov complexity''' of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of the shortest [[computer program]] (in a predetermined [[programming language]]) that produces the object as output. It is a measure of the [[computation]]al resources needed to specify the object, and is also known as '''descriptive complexity''', '''Kolmogorov–[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]] complexity''', '''algorithmic complexity''', '''algorithmic entropy''', or '''program-size complexity'''. It is named after [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], who first published on the subject in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Andrey Kolmogorov|first=Andrey|last=Kolmogorov|year=1963|title=On Tables of Random Numbers| journal=Sankhyā Ser. A.|volume=25|pages=369–375|mr=178484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Andrey Kolmogorov|first=Andrey|last=Kolmogorov|year=1998|title=On Tables of Random Numbers| journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=207|issue=2|pages=387–395|doi=10.1016/S0304-3975(98)00075-9 |mr=1643414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of Kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and [[Proof of impossibility|prove impossibility]] results akin to [[Cantor's diagonal argument]], [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], and [[halting problem|Turing's halting problem]].
In particular, for almost all objects, it is not possible to compute even a [[lower bound]] for its Kolmogorov complexity ([[#Chaitin's incompleteness theorem|Chaitin 1964]]), let alone its exact value.

==Definition==
Consider the following two [[string (computer science)|strings]] of 32 lowercase letters and digits.

: Example 1: &lt;code&gt;abababababababababababababababab&lt;/code&gt;
: Example 2: &lt;code&gt;4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7&lt;/code&gt;

The first string has a short English-language description, namely "&lt;tt&gt;ab 16 times&lt;/tt&gt;", which consists of '''11''' characters. The second one has no obvious simple description (using the same character set) other than writing down the string itself, which has '''32''' characters.

More formally, the [[complexity]] of a string is the length of the shortest possible description of the string in some fixed [[Turing complete|universal]] description language (the sensitivity of complexity relative to the choice of description language is discussed below). It can be shown that the Kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be more than a few bytes larger than the length of the string itself. Strings like the ''abab'' example above, whose Kolmogorov complexity is small relative to the string's size, are not considered to be complex.

The Kolmogorov complexity can be defined for any mathematical object, but for simplicity the scope of this article is restricted to strings. We must first specify a description language for strings.  Such a description language can be based on any computer programming language, such as [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], or [[Java virtual machine]] bytecode.  If '''P''' is a program which outputs a string ''x'', then '''P''' is a description of ''x''. The length of the description is just the length of '''P''' as a character string, multiplied by the number of bits in a character (e.g. 7 for [[ASCII]]).

We could, alternatively, choose an encoding for [[Turing machine]]s, where an ''encoding'' is a function which associates to each Turing Machine '''M''' a bitstring &lt;'''M'''&gt;. If '''M''' is a Turing Machine which, on input ''w'', outputs string ''x'', then the concatenated string &lt;'''M'''&gt; ''w'' is a description of ''x''. For theoretical analysis, this approach is more suited for constructing detailed formal proofs and is generally preferred in the research literature. In this article, an informal approach is discussed.

Any string ''s'' has at least one description. For example, the second string above is output by the program:

  '''function''' GenerateExample2String()
     '''return''' "4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7"

where the first string is output by the (much shorter) pseudo-code:

  '''function''' GenerateExample1String()
     '''return''' "ab" * 16

If a description ''d''(''s'') of a string ''s'' is of minimal length (i.e. it uses the fewest bits), it is called a '''minimal description''' of ''s''.  Thus, the length of ''d''(''s'') (i.e. the number of bits in the description) is the '''Kolmogorov complexity''' of ''s'', written ''K''(''s''). Symbolically,

:''K''(''s'') = |''d''(''s'')|.

The length of the shortest description will depend on the choice of description language; but the effect of changing languages is bounded (a result called the ''invariance theorem''). The standard textbook is authored by [[Ming Li]] and [[Paul Vitanyi]]  
in the references.

==Invariance theorem==

===Informal treatment===
There are some description languages which are optimal, in the following sense: given any description of an object in a description language, said description may be used in the optimal description language with a constant overhead. The constant depends only on the languages involved, not on the description of the object, nor the object being described.

Here is an example of an optimal description language. A description will have two parts:

* The first part describes another description language.
* The second part is a description of the object in that language.

In more technical terms, the first part of a description is a computer program, with the second part being the input to that computer program which produces the object as output.

'''The invariance theorem follows:''' Given any description language ''L'', the optimal description language is at least as efficient as ''L'', with some constant overhead.

'''Proof:''' Any description ''D'' in ''L'' can be converted into a description in the optimal language by first describing ''L'' as a computer program ''P'' (part 1), and then using the original description ''D'' as input to that program (part 2). The
total length of this new description ''D&amp;prime;'' is (approximately):

:|''D&amp;prime;''| = |''P''| + |''D''|

The length of ''P'' is a constant that doesn't depend on ''D''. So, there is at most a constant overhead, regardless of the object described. Therefore, the optimal language is universal [[up to]] this additive constant.

===A more formal treatment===
'''Theorem''': If ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the complexity functions relative to [[Turing complete]] description languages ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then there is a constant ''c''&amp;nbsp;– which depends only on the languages ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; chosen&amp;nbsp;– such that

:∀''s''.  −''c'' ≤ ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') − ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') ≤ ''c''.

'''Proof''': By symmetry, it suffices to prove that there is some constant ''c'' such that for all strings ''s''

:''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') ≤ ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') + ''c''.

Now, suppose there is a program in the language ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which acts as an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

   '''function''' InterpretLanguage('''string''' ''p'')

where ''p'' is a program in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The interpreter is characterized by the following property:

: Running &lt;code&gt;InterpretLanguage&lt;/code&gt; on input ''p'' returns the result of running ''p''.

Thus, if '''P''' is a program in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is a minimal description of ''s'', then &lt;code&gt;InterpretLanguage&lt;/code&gt;('''P''') returns the string ''s''. The length of this description of ''s'' is the sum of

# The length of the program &lt;code&gt;InterpretLanguage&lt;/code&gt;, which we can take to be the constant ''c''.
# The length of '''P''' which by definition is ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'').

This proves the desired upper bound.

==History and context==
[[Algorithmic information theory]] is the area of computer science that studies Kolmogorov complexity and other complexity measures on strings (or other [[data structure]]s).

The concept and theory of Kolmogorov Complexity is based on a crucial theorem first discovered by [[Ray Solomonoff]], who published it in 1960, describing it in "A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Ray Solomonoff | last=Solomonoff |first= Ray | url=http://world.std.com/~rjs/rayfeb60.pdf |format=PDF | title=A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference | journal= Report V-131 | date= February 4, 1960 }} [http://world.std.com/~rjs/z138.pdf revision], Nov., 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his invention of [[algorithmic probability]]. He gave a more complete description in his 1964 publications, "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference," Part 1 and Part 2 in ''Information and Control''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Andrey Kolmogorov later [[multiple discovery|independently published]] this theorem in ''Problems Inform. Transmission''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=1 |issue=1 |year=1965 |pages=1–7 |title=Three Approaches to the Quantitative Definition of Information |url=http://www.ece.umd.edu/~abarg/ppi/contents/1-65-abstracts.html#1-65.2 |journal=Problems Inform.

Gregory Chaitin also presents this theorem in ''J. ACM''&amp;nbsp;– Chaitin's paper was submitted October 1966 and revised in December 1968, and cites both Solomonoff's and Kolmogorov's papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chaitin | first1 = Gregory J. | title = On the Simplicity and Speed of Programs for Computing Infinite Sets of Natural Numbers| url=http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/acm69b.pdf| journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 16 | pages = 407–422| year = 1969 | doi = 10.1145/321526.321530 | issue = 3| citeseerx = 10.1.1.15.3821 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem says that, among algorithms that decode strings from their descriptions (codes), there exists an optimal one. This algorithm, for all strings, allows codes as short as allowed by any other algorithm up to an additive constant that depends on the algorithms, but not on the strings themselves. Solomonoff used this algorithm, and the code lengths it allows, to define a "universal probability" of a string on which inductive inference of the subsequent digits of the string can be based. Kolmogorov used this theorem to define several functions of strings, including complexity, randomness, and information.

When Kolmogorov became aware of Solomonoff's work, he acknowledged Solomonoff's priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kolmogorov | first1=A. | title=Logical basis for information theory and probability theory | journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory | volume=14|issue=5 | pages=662–664 | year=1968 | doi =10.1109/TIT.1968.1054210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, Solomonoff's work was better known in the Soviet Union than in the Western World. The general consensus in the scientific community, however, was to associate this type of complexity with Kolmogorov, who was concerned with randomness of a sequence, while Algorithmic Probability became associated with Solomonoff, who focused on prediction using his invention of the universal prior probability distribution. The broader area encompassing descriptional complexity and probability is often called Kolmogorov complexity. The computer scientist Ming Li considers this an example of the [[Matthew effect (sociology)|Matthew effect]]: "…to everyone who has more will be given…"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-49820-1_1 |chapter=Preliminaries |title=An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and its Applications |pages=1–99 |series=Texts in Computer Science |year=2008 |last1=Li |first1=Ming |last2=Vitányi |first2=Paul |isbn=978-0-387-33998-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several other variants of Kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information. The most widely used one is based on [[self-delimiting program]]s, and is mainly due to [[Leonid Levin]] (1974).

An axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity based on [[Blum axioms]] (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by Andrey Kolmogorov.&lt;ref name=Burgin1982&gt;Burgin, M. (1982), "Generalized Kolmogorov complexity and duality in theory of computations", ''Notices of the Russian Academy of Sciences'', v.25, No. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;19–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic results==
In the following discussion, let ''K''(''s'') be the complexity of the string ''s''.

It is not hard to see that the minimal description of a string cannot be too much larger than the string itself&amp;nbsp;— the program &lt;code&gt;GenerateFixedString&lt;/code&gt; above that outputs ''s'' is a fixed amount larger than ''s''.

'''Theorem''': There is a constant ''c'' such that

:∀''s''. ''K''(''s'') ≤ |''s''| + ''c''.

===Uncomputability of Kolmogorov complexity===

'''Theorem''': There exist strings of arbitrarily large Kolmogorov complexity. Formally: for each ''n'' ∈ ℕ, there is a string ''s'' with ''K''(''s'') ≥ ''n''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;However, an ''s'' with ''K''(''s'') = ''n'' need not exist for every ''n''. For example, if ''n'' is not a multiple of 7 bits, no [[ASCII]] program can have a length of exactly ''n'' bits.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof:''' Otherwise all of the infinitely many possible finite strings could be generated by the finitely many&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are 1 + 2 + 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 different program texts of length up to ''n'' bits; cf. [[geometric series]]. If program lengths are to be multiples of 7 bits, even fewer program texts exist.&lt;/ref&gt; programs with a complexity below ''n'' bits.

'''Theorem''':  ''K'' is not a [[computable function]]. In other words, there is no program which takes a string ''s'' as input and produces the integer ''K''(''s'') as output.

The following [[indirect proof|indirect '''proof''']] uses a simple [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-like language to denote programs; for sake of proof simplicity assume its description (i.e. an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]) to have a length of {{val|1400000}} bits.
Assume for contradiction there is a program

   '''function''' KolmogorovComplexity('''string''' s)

which takes as input a string ''s'' and returns ''K''(''s''); for sake of proof simplicity, assume the program's length to be {{val|7000000000}} bits.
Now, consider the following program of length {{val|1288}} bits:

   '''function''' GenerateComplexString()
      '''for''' i = 1 '''to''' infinity:
         '''for each''' string s '''of''' length exactly i
            '''if''' KolmogorovComplexity(s) &gt;= 8000000000
               '''return''' s

Using &lt;code&gt;KolmogorovComplexity&lt;/code&gt; as a subroutine, the program tries every string, starting with the shortest, until it returns a string with Kolmogorov complexity at least {{val|8000000000}} bits,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;By the previous theorem, such a string exists, hence the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop will eventually terminate.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. a string that cannot be produced by any program shorter than {{val|8000000000}} bits. However, the overall length of the above program that produced ''s'' is only {{val|7001401288}} bits,&lt;ref group=note&gt;including the language interpreter and the subroutine code for &lt;code&gt;KolmogorovComplexity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which is a contradiction. (If the code of &lt;code&gt;KolmogorovComplexity&lt;/code&gt; is shorter, the contradiction remains. If it is longer, the constant used in &lt;code&gt;GenerateComplexString&lt;/code&gt; can always be changed appropriately.)&lt;ref group=note&gt;If &lt;code&gt;KolmogorovComplexity&lt;/code&gt; has length ''n'' bits, the constant ''m'' used in &lt;code&gt;GenerateComplexString&lt;/code&gt; needs to be adapted to satisfy {{nobreak|''n'' + {{val|1400000}} + {{val|1218}} + 7·log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'') &lt; ''m''}}, which is always possible since ''m'' grows faster than log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'').&lt;/ref&gt;

The above proof uses a contradiction similar to that of the [[Berry paradox]]: "&lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|1}}&lt;/sub&gt;The &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|2}}&lt;/sub&gt;smallest &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|3}}&lt;/sub&gt;positive &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|4}}&lt;/sub&gt;integer &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|5}}&lt;/sub&gt;that &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|6}}&lt;/sub&gt;cannot &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|7}}&lt;/sub&gt;be &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|8}}&lt;/sub&gt;defined &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|9}}&lt;/sub&gt;in &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|10}}&lt;/sub&gt;fewer &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|11}}&lt;/sub&gt;than &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|12}}&lt;/sub&gt;twenty &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|13}}&lt;/sub&gt;English &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|14}}&lt;/sub&gt;words". It is also possible to show the non-computability of ''K'' by reduction from the non-computability of the halting problem ''H'', since ''K'' and ''H'' are [[turing degree#Turing equivalence|Turing-equivalent]].&lt;ref&gt;Stated without proof in: [http://www.daimi.au.dk/~bromille/DC05/Kolmogorov.pdf "Course notes for Data Compression - Kolmogorov complexity"], 2005, P. B. Miltersen, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a corollary, humorously called the "[[full employment theorem]]" in the programming language community, stating that there is no perfect size-optimizing compiler.

==== A naive attempt at a program to compute ''K'' ====

At first glance it might seem trivial to write a program which can compute ''K''(''s'') for any ''s'' (thus disproving the above theorem), such as the following:

   '''function''' KolmogorovComplexity('''string''' s)
      '''for''' i = 1 '''to''' infinity:
         '''for each''' string p '''of''' length exactly i
            '''if''' isValidProgram(p) '''and''' evaluate(p) == s
               '''return''' i

This program iterates through all possible programs (by iterating through all possible strings and only considering those which are valid programs), starting with the shortest. Each program is executed to find the result produced by that program, comparing it to the input ''s''. If the result matches the length of the program is returned.

However this will not work because some of the programs ''p'' tested will not terminate, e.g. if they contain infinite loops. There is no way to avoid all of these programs by testing them in some way before executing them due to the non-computability of the halting problem.

:''K''(''X'',''Y'') ≤ ''K''(''X'') + ''K''(''Y''|''X'') + ''O''(log(''K''(''X'',''Y''))).

It states that the shortest program that reproduces ''X'' and ''Y'' is [[Big-O notation|no more]] than a logarithmic term larger than a program to reproduce ''X'' and a program to reproduce ''Y'' given ''X''. Using this statement, one can define [[Mutual information#Absolute mutual information|an analogue of mutual information for Kolmogorov complexity]].

==Compression==
It is straightforward to compute upper bounds for ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;– simply [[data compression|compress]] the string ''s'' with some method, implement the corresponding decompressor in the chosen language, concatenate the decompressor to the compressed string, and measure the length of the resulting string&amp;nbsp;– concretely, the size of a [[self-extracting archive]] in the given language.

A string ''s'' is compressible by a number ''c'' if it has a description whose length does not exceed |''s''| − ''c'' bits. This is equivalent to saying that ''K''(''s'') ≤ |''s''| − ''c''.  Otherwise, ''s'' is incompressible by ''c''. A string incompressible by 1 is said to be simply ''incompressible''&amp;nbsp;– by the [[pigeonhole principle]], which applies because every compressed string maps to only one uncompressed string, [[incompressible string]]s must exist, since there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; bit strings of length ''n'', but only 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 shorter strings, that is, strings of length less than ''n'', (i.e. with length 0, 1, …, ''n&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref group=note&gt;As there are {{nobr|1=''N''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''L''&lt;/sup&gt;}} strings of length ''L'', the number of strings of lengths {{nowrap|1=''L'' = 0, 1, …, ''n'' − 1}} is {{nobr|''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + … + ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{nobr|2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + … + 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is a finite [[geometric series]] with sum {{nobr|2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + … + 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} = {{nobr|1 = 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; × (1 − 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) / (1 − 2) = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the same reason, most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be significantly compressed&amp;nbsp;– their ''K''(''s'') is not much smaller than |''s''|, the length of ''s'' in bits. To make this precise, fix a value of ''n''. There are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; bitstrings of length ''n''. The [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform]] [[probability]] distribution on the space of these bitstrings assigns exactly equal weight 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to each string of length ''n''.

'''Theorem''': With the uniform probability distribution on the space of bitstrings of length ''n'', the probability that a string is incompressible by ''c'' is at least 1 − 2&lt;sup&gt;−''c''+1&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

To prove the theorem, note that the number of descriptions of length not exceeding ''n'' − ''c'' is given by the geometric series:

: 1 + 2 + 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + … + 2&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − ''c''&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−''c''+1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1.

There remain at least

: 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−''c''+1&lt;/sup&gt; + 1

bitstrings of length ''n'' that are incompressible by ''c''.  To determine the probability, divide by 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Chaitin's incompleteness theorem==
[[File:Kolmogorov complexity and computable lower bounds.gif|thumb|right|500px|Kolmogorov complexity {{color|#800000|''K''(''s'')}}, and two computable lower bound functions &lt;code&gt;{{color|#808000|prog1(s)}}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{{color|#008000|prog2(s)}}&lt;/code&gt;. The horizontal axis ([[logarithmic scale]]) enumerates all [[string (computer science)|strings]] ''s'', ordered by length; the vertical axis ([[linear scale]]) measures Kolmogorov complexity in [[bit]]s. Most strings are incompressible, i.e. their Kolmogorov complexity exceeds their length by a constant amount. 17 compressible strings are shown in the picture, appearing as almost vertical slopes. Due to Chaitin's incompleteness theorem (1974), the output of any program computing a lower bound of the Kolmogorov complexity cannot exceed some fixed limit, which is independent of the input string ''s''.]]
We know that, in the set of all possible strings, most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be described in any significantly "compressed" way. However, it turns out that the fact that a specific string is complex cannot be formally proven, if the complexity of the string is above a certain threshold. The precise formalization is as follows. First, fix a particular [[axiomatic system]] '''S''' for the [[natural number]]s. The axiomatic system has to be powerful enough so that, to certain assertions  '''A''' about complexity of strings, one can associate a formula '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sub&gt; in '''S'''. This association must have the following property:

If '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sub&gt; is provable from the axioms of '''S''', then the corresponding assertion '''A''' must be true. This "formalization" can be achieved, either by an artificial encoding such as a [[Gödel numbering]], or by a formalization which more clearly respects the intended interpretation of '''S'''.

'''Theorem''': There exists a constant ''L'' (which only depends on the particular axiomatic system and the choice of description language) such that there does not exist a string ''s'' for which the statement

:''K''(''s'') ≥  ''L'' (as formalized in '''S''')

can be proven within the axiomatic system '''S'''.

Note that, by the abundance of nearly incompressible strings, the vast majority of those statements must be true.

The proof of this result is modeled on a self-referential construction used in [[Berry's paradox]]. The proof is by contradiction. If the theorem were false, then

:'''Assumption (X)''': For any integer ''n'' there exists a string ''s'' for which there is a proof in '''S''' of the formula "''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n''" (which we assume can be formalized in '''S''').

We can find an effective enumeration of all the formal proofs in '''S''' by some procedure

   '''function''' NthProof('''int''' ''n'')
which takes as input ''n'' and outputs some proof. This function enumerates all proofs. Some of these are proofs for formulas we do not care about here, since every possible proof in the language of '''S''' is produced for some ''n''. Some of these are complexity formulas of the form ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n'' where ''s'' and ''n'' are constants in the language of '''S'''. There is a program

   '''function''' NthProofProvesComplexityFormula('''int''' ''n'')

which determines whether the ''n''th proof actually proves a complexity formula ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''L''. The strings ''s'', and the integer ''L'' in turn, are computable by programs:

   '''function''' StringNthProof('''int''' ''n'')

   '''function''' ComplexityLowerBoundNthProof('''int''' ''n'')

Consider the following program

   '''function''' GenerateProvablyComplexString('''int''' ''n'')
      '''for''' i = 1 to infinity:
         '''if'''  NthProofProvesComplexityFormula(i) '''and''' ComplexityLowerBoundNthProof(i) ≥ ''n''
            '''return''' StringNthProof(''i'')

Given an ''n'', this program tries every proof until it finds a string and a proof in the [[formal system]] '''S''' of the formula ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''L'' for some ''L''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n''. The program terminates by our '''Assumption (X)'''. Now, this program has a length ''U''. There is an integer ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''U''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''C''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''C'' is the overhead cost of

    '''function''' GenerateProvablyParadoxicalString()
       '''return''' GenerateProvablyComplexString(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)

(note that ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is hard-coded into the above function, and the summand log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) already allows for its encoding). The program GenerateProvablyParadoxicalString outputs a string ''s'' for which there exists an ''L'' such that ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''L'' can be formally proved in '''S''' with ''L''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is true. However, ''s'' is also described by a program of length ''U''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''C'', so its complexity is less than ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  This contradiction proves '''Assumption (X)''' cannot hold.

Similar ideas are used to prove the properties of [[Chaitin's constant]].

==Minimum message length==
{{Main|Minimum message length}}
The minimum message length principle of statistical and inductive inference and machine learning was developed by [[Chris Wallace (computer scientist)|C.S. Wallace]] and D.M. Boulton in 1968. MML is [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] (i.e. it incorporates prior beliefs) and information-theoretic. It has the desirable properties of statistical invariance (i.e. the inference transforms with a re-parametrisation, such as from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates), statistical consistency (i.e. even for very hard problems, MML will converge to any underlying model) and efficiency (i.e. the MML model will converge to any true underlying model about as quickly as is possible). C.S. Wallace and D.L. Dowe (1999) showed a formal connection between MML and algorithmic information theory (or Kolmogorov complexity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |citeseerx=10.1.1.17.321 |title=Minimum Message Length and Kolmogorov Complexity |journal=Computer Journal |volume=42 |pages=270–283 |year=1999 |last1=Wallace |first1=C. S. |last2=Dowe |first2=D. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kolmogorov randomness==
{{See also|Algorithmic randomness}}
''Kolmogorov randomness'' defines a string (usually of [[bit]]s) as being [[randomness|random]] if and only if it is shorter than any [[computer program]] that can produce that string.  To make this precise, a [[Universal Turing machine|universal computer]] (or universal Turing machine) must be specified, so that "program" means a program for this universal machine. A random string in this sense is "incompressible" in that it is impossible to "compress" the string into a program whose length is shorter than the length of the string itself.  A [[counting argument]] is used to show that, for any universal computer, there is at least one algorithmically random string of each length.  Whether any particular string is random, however, depends on the specific universal computer that is chosen.

This definition can be extended to define a notion of randomness for ''infinite'' sequences from a finite alphabet. These [[algorithmically random sequence]]s can be defined in three equivalent ways. One way uses an effective analogue of [[measure theory]]; another uses effective [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingales]].  The third way defines an infinite sequence to be random if the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity of its initial segments grows quickly enough&amp;nbsp;— there must be a constant ''c'' such that the complexity of an initial segment of length ''n'' is always at least ''n''−''c''.  This definition, unlike the definition of randomness for a finite string, is not affected by which universal machine is used to define prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0019-9958(66)80018-9 |title=The definition of random sequences |journal=Information and Control |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=602–619 |year=1966 |last1=Martin-Löf |first1=Per }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For dynamical systems, entropy rate and algorithmic complexity of the trajectories are related by a theorem of Brudno, that the equality K(x;T) =  h(T) holds for almost all x.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Stefano Galatolo, Mathieu Hoyrup, Cristóbal Rojas |title=Effective symbolic dynamics, random points, statistical behavior, complexity and entropy | journal=Information and Computation | volume=208 | pages=23–41 | year=2010| url=http://www.loria.fr/~hoyrup/random_ergodic.pdf | doi=10.1016/j.ic.2009.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |author=Alexei Kaltchenko |title=Algorithms for Estimating Information Distance with Application to Bioinformatics and Linguistics  |year=2004 |eprint=cs.CC/0404039}}&lt;/ref&gt; that for the output of [[Markov information source]]s, Kolmogorov complexity is related to the [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] of the information source. More precisely, the Kolmogorov complexity of the output of a Markov information source, normalized by the length of the output, converges almost surely (as the length of the output goes to infinity) to the [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] of the source.

==Applications==
The notion of Kolmogorov complexity has been used to evaluate the complexity of geographical areas from maps or from field observations.&lt;ref name=Papadimitriou2002&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1470-160X(02)00052-3 |title=Modelling indicators and indices of landscape complexity: An approach using G.I.S |journal=Ecological Indicators |volume=2 |pages=17–25 |year=2002 |last1=Papadimitriou |first1=F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditional versions==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
The conditional Kolmogorov complexity of two strings &lt;math&gt;K(x|y)&lt;/math&gt; is, roughly speaking, defined as the Kolmogorov complexity of ''x'' given ''y'' as an auxiliary input to the procedure.&lt;ref name="Rissanen2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jorma Rissanen|title=Information and Complexity in Statistical Modeling|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-68812-1|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ming Li|author2=Paul M.B.

There is also a length-conditional complexity &lt;math&gt;K(x|L(x))&lt;/math&gt;, which is the complexity of ''x'' given the length of ''x'' as known/input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ming Li|author2=Paul M.B.

{{List missing criteria|date=November 2013|discuss=Talk:List of chemical compounds with unusual names#Inclusion criteria}}
[[IUPAC nomenclature|Chemical nomenclature]], replete as it is with [[chemical compound|compounds]] with complex names, is a [[wikt:repository|repository]] for some very peculiar and sometimes startling names. A browse through the ''Physical Constants of Organic Compounds'' in the ''[[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]'' (a fundamental resource) will reveal not just the whimsical work of [[chemist]]s, but the sometimes peculiar compound names that occur as the consequence of simple [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtaposition]]. Some names derive legitimately from their chemical makeup, from the geographic region where they may be found, the plant or animal species from which they are isolated or the name of the discoverer.

Some are given intentionally unusual [[trivial name]]s based on their structure, a notable property or at the whim of those who first isolate them. However, many trivial names predate formal naming conventions. Trivial names can also be ambiguous or carry different meanings in different industries, geographic regions and languages.

Godly noted that "Trivial names having the status of [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] are carefully tailor-made for their field of use and are internationally accepted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Godly | first = E.W. | title = Chemical Nomenclature | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | year = 1998 | page = 20 | isbn = 0-7514-0475-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his preface to ''Chemical Nomenclature'', Thurlow wrote that "Chemical names do not have to be deadly serious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thurlow | first = Kevin | title = Chemical Nomenclature | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | year = 1998 | pages = xii | isbn = 0-7514-0475-6 | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt; A website in existence since 1997&lt;ref name=MayWeb&gt;{{cite web |title=Molecules with Silly or Unusual Names |first=Paul |last=May|url=http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/sillymolecules/sillymols.htm |date=28 May 2013 |publisher=Bristol University |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained at the [[University of Bristol]] lists a selection of "molecules with silly or unusual names" strictly for entertainment. These so-called silly or funny trivial names (of course depending on culture) can also serve an educational purpose. In an article in the ''[[Journal of Chemical Education]]'', Dennis Ryan argues that students of organic nomenclature (considered a "dry and boring" subject) may actually take an interest in it when tasked with the job of converting funny-sounding chemical trivial names to their proper systematic names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Old MacDonald Named a Compound: Branched Enynenynols|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|year=1997|first=Dennis|last=Ryan|volume=74|issue=7|page=782|id= |url=http://www.jce.divched.org/Journal/Issues/1997/Jul/PlusSub/V74N07/p782.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-08-16|doi=10.1021/ed074p782|bibcode = 1997JChEd..74..782R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection listed below presents a sample of trivial names and gives an idea how chemists are inspired when they coin a brand new name for a chemical compound outside of systematic naming. It also includes some examples of systematic names and acronyms that accidentally resemble English words.

== Elements ==

[[Glenn Seaborg]] told his students that he proposed the chemical symbol Pu (from [[wikt:P U|P U]])  instead of the conventional "Pl" for [[plutonium]] as a joke, only to find it officially adopted.&lt;ref name="Peggy House"&gt;[http://www.nmu.edu/seaborg/node/9 Glenn T. Seaborg, Citizen-Scholar], By Peggy House, Reprinted from The Seaborg Center Bulletin, April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
Unununium (Uuu) was the former temporary name of the chemical element number 111, a synthetic transuranium element. This element was named [[roentgenium]] (Rg) in November 2004.

'''Mahābhūta''' is [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]] for "great element."&lt;ref&gt;Or, more literally, "Great Natures." See Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 507, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3646.pali entry for "Bhūta."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{Further|The 36 tattvas}}

In Hinduism's sacred literature, the "great" or "gross" elements (''mahābhūta'') are fivefold: space (or "ether"), air, fire, water and earth.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Monier-Williams]] Sanskrit Dictionary where ''Mahābhūta'' is defined as: "a great element, gross el[ement] (of which 5 are reckoned, viz. ether, air, fire, water, earth ..., as distinguished from the subtle el[ement] or ''Tanmātra''...)."  Monier-Williams (1899), p. 798, entry for "Mahā-," retrieved 24 Dec 2008 from "U. Cologne" at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0798-mahApheTkArIya.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 79|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the [[Taittiriya Upanishad|{{IAST|Taittirīya Upaniṣad}}]] describes the five "sheaths" of a person (Sanskrit: ''[[purusha|puru{{IAST|ṣ}}a]]''), starting with the grossest level of the five evolving great elements:
:From this very self (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|{{IAST|ā}}tman]]'') did space come into being; from space, air; from air, fire; from fire, the waters, from the waters, the earth; from the earth, plants; from plants, food; and from food, man.... Different from and lying within this man formed from the essence of food is the self (''{{IAST|ā}}tman'') consisting of lifebreath....  Different from and lying within this self consisting of breath is the self (''{{IAST|ā}}tman'') consisting of mind.... Different from and lying within this self consisting of mind is the self (''{{IAST|ā}}tman'') consisting of perception.... Different from and lying within this self consisting of perception is the self (''{{IAST|ā}}tman'') consisting of bliss....&lt;ref&gt;[[Taittiriya Upanishad|TU]] 2.1–2.5, trans. Olivelle (1996), pp. 185–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad|{{IAST|Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad}}]], God is identified as the source of the great elements:
:Some wise men say it is inherent nature, while others say it is time – all totally deluded.  It is rather the greatness of God present in the world by means of which this wheel of ''[[brahman]]'' goes around.  Who always encompasses this whole world – the knower, the architect of time, the one without qualities, and the all-knowing one – it is at his command that the work of creation, to be conceived of as earth, water, fire, air, and space, unfolds itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shvetashvatara Upanishad|SU]] 6.1–6.2, trans. Olivelle (1996), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same Upanishad also mentions, "When earth, water fire, air and akasa arise, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death." (Verse 2.12).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/upanishads/svetasvatara_upanishad.php Shvetashvatara Upanishad]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
In Buddhism, the four Great Elements (Pali: ''cattāro mahābhūtāni'') are earth, water, fire and air.  Mahābhūta is generally synonymous with '''catudhātu''', which is Pāli for the "Four Elements."&lt;ref&gt;Note that the Pāli word ''dhātu'' is used in multiple contexts in the [[Pali canon|Pāli canon]].  For instance, Bodhi (2000), pp. 527–8, identifies four different ways that ''dhātu'' is used including in terms of the "eighteen elements" and, as in this article, in terms of "the four primary elements."&lt;/ref&gt;  In early [[Buddhism]], the Four Elements are a basis for understanding that leads one through unbinding of 'Rupa' or materiality to the supreme state of pure 'Emptiness' or Nirvana.

===Definitions===

In the [[Pali canon]],&lt;ref&gt;These elaborations on the elements can be found in the [[Majjhima Nikaya]] discourses nos. 28, 62, 140.  See below for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; the most basic elements are usually identified as four in number but, on occasion, a fifth and, to an even lesser extent, a sixth element may be also be identified.

====Four primary elements====

In canonical texts, the four Great Elements refer to elements that are both "external" (that is, outside the body, such as a river) and "internal" (that is, of the body, such as blood).  These elements are described as follows:

*'''Earth element''' (''pru{{IAST|ṭ}}havī-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Earth element represents the quality of solidity or attractive forces. Any matter where attractive forces are in prominence (solid bodies) are called earth elements. Internal earth elements include head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bone, organs, intestinal material, etc.&lt;ref&gt;The traditional list of body parts associated with the earth element are the first 19 of 31 body parts – from head hair to feces – identified in the Pali Canon with the contemplation of [[Patikulamanasikara]], with the catch all phrase of "or whatever else internal, within oneself, is hard, solid, &amp; sustained" (trans. [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.028.than.html Thanissaro, 2003b)] added.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Water (or liquid) element''' (''āpa-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Water element represents the quality of Liquidity or relative motion. Any matter where relative motion of particles is in prominence are called water elements. Internal water elements include bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, nasal mucus, urine, semen, etc.&lt;ref&gt;The traditional list of water-element body parts are the latter twelve of 31 body parts – from bile to urine – identified in [[Patikulamanasikara]] contemplations, with the catch all phrase of "or whatever else internal, within oneself, is liquid, watery, &amp; sustained" (trans. [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.028.than.html Thanissaro, 2003b)] added.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Fire element''' (''teja-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Fire element represents the quality of heat or energy. Any matter where energy is in prominence are called fire elements. Internal fire elements include those bodily mechanisms that produce physical warmth, ageing, digestion, etc.
*'''Air (or wind) element''' (''vāyu-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Air element represents the quality of expansion or repulsive forces. Any matter where repulsive forces are in prominence are called air elements. Internal air elements includes air associated with the pulmonary system (for example, for breathing), the intestinal system ("winds in the belly and ... bowels"), etc.

Any entity that carry one or more of these qualities (attractive forces, repulsive forces, energy and relative motion) are called matter (''rupa''). The material world is considered to be nothing but a combination of these qualities arranged in space (''akasa''). The result of these qualities are the inputs to our five senses, color (''warna''), smell (''ghandda''), taste (''rasa'') and sensation of body (''ojha''). The matter that we perceive in our mind are just a mental interpretation of these qualities.

====Fifth and sixth elements====

In addition to the above four elements of underived matter, two other elements are occasionally found in the Pali Canon:&lt;ref&gt;The "space element" is encountered more frequently in the canonical discourses than is the "consciousness element."  Examples of discourses that include both of these latter elements are [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 33 (Walshe, 1995, p. 500, para. 16), [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 140 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.140.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997c)], and [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 27.9 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn27/sn27.001-010.than.html#sn27.009 (Thanissaro, 1994).]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Space element''' (''ākāsa-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Internal space elements includes bodily orifices such as the ears, nostrils, mouth, anus, etc.
{{see also|Prayer flag#Colour and order}}

*'''Consciousness element''' (''[[Vijñāna|viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a]]-dhātu'')&lt;br&gt;Described as "pure and bright" (''parisuddha{{IAST|ṃ}} pariyodāta{{IAST|ṃ}}''), used to cognise the three feelings (''[[vedana]]'') of pleasure, pain and neither-pleasure-nor-pain, and the arising and passing of the sense contact (''[[phassa]]'') upon which these feelings are dependent.

According to the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]], the "space element" is identified as "secondary" or "derived" (''upādā'').&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (2001), pp. 5, 35 ''n''. 9.  For more information regarding "primary/underived" and "secondary/derived" matter, see the article [[Rupa (Buddhism)|Rupa]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensory qualities, not substances===

[[Rūpa]] (matter) means both materiality and sensibility—it signifies, for example, a tactile object both insofar as that object is tactile and that it can be sensed. Rūpa is never a materiality which can be separated or isolated from cognizance; such a non-empirical category is incongruous in the context of early Buddhism. Rūpa is not a substratum or substance which has sensibility as a property. It functions in early Buddhist thought as perceivable physicality. Matter, or rūpa, is defined in its function; what it does, not what it is.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Chʼeng Wei-shih Lun.'' Routledge, 2002, page 183.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the four great elements are conceptual abstractions drawn from the sensorium. They are sensorial typologies, and are not metaphysically materialistic.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Chʼeng Wei-shih Lun.'' Routledge, 2002, page 184.&lt;/ref&gt; They are not meant to give an account of matter as constitutive of external, mind-independent reality.&lt;ref&gt;Noa Ronkin, ''Early Buddhist Metaphysics the Making of a Philosophical Tradition.'' Routledge, 2005, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soteriological uses===

The Four Elements are used in [[Buddhist]] texts to both elucidate the concept of suffering (''[[dukkha]]'') and as an object of meditation. The earliest Buddhist texts explain that the four primary material elements are the sensory qualities solidity, fluidity, temperature, and mobility; their characterisation as earth, water, fire, and air, respectively, is declared an abstraction – instead of concentrating on the fact of material existence, one observes how a physical thing is sensed, felt, perceived.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Lusthaus]], "What is and isn't Yogacara." He specifically discusses early Buddhism as well as Yogacara. {{cite web|url=http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331102337/http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm |archivedate=31 March 2010 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Understanding suffering====

The Four Elements pertinence to the Buddhist notion of suffering comes about due to:

:* The Four Elements are the primary component of "form" (''[[rūpa]]'').

:* "Form" is first category of the "Five Aggregates" (''[[khandhas]]'').

:* The Five Aggregates are the ultimate basis for suffering (''dukkha'') in the "[[Four Noble Truths]]."

Schematically, this can be represented in reverse order as:

:Four Noble Truths → Suffering → Aggregates → Form → Four Elements

Thus, to deeply understand the Buddha's Four Noble Truths, it is beneficial to have an understanding of the Great Elements.

====Meditation object====

In the [[Mahasatipatthana Sutta]] ("The Greater Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness," [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 22), in listing various bodily meditation techniques, the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] instructs:

:"...Just as if a skilled butcher or his assistant, having slaughtered a cow, were to sit at a crossroads with the carcass divided into portions, so a monk reviews this very body ... in terms of the elements: 'There are in this body the earth-element, the water-element, the fire-element, the air-element.' So he abides contemplating body in body internally...."&lt;ref&gt;Walshe (1995), p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Visuddhimagga's well-known list of forty meditation objects (''[[Kammaṭṭhāna|kamma{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hāna]]''), the great elements are listed as the first four objects.

[[B. Alan Wallace]] compares the Theravada meditative practice of "attending to the emblem of consciousness" to the practice in [[Mahamudra]] and [[Dzogchen]] of "maintaining the mind upon non-conceptuality", which is also aimed at focusing on the nature of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;B. Alan Wallace, ''The bridge of quiescence: experiencing Tibetan Buddhist meditation.'' Carus Publishing Company, 1998, page 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MoEDAL''' ('''Monopole and Exotics Detector at the LHC''') is a [[particle physics]] experiment at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC).

==Experiment==
MoEDAL shares the cavern at Point 8 with [[LHCb]], and its prime goal is to directly search for the [[magnetic monopole]] (MM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=Giacomelli |first1=G. |last2=Sioli |first2=M. |year=2002 |title=Astroparticle Physics |eprint=hep-ex/0211035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=Giacomelli |first1=G.  |last2=Patrizii |first2=L. |year=2001 |title=Magnetic Monopoles |eprint=hep-ex/0112009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kalbfleisch |first1=G.

To detect these particles, the project uses [[Solid-state nuclear track detector|nuclear track detectors]] (NTDs), which suffer characteristic damage due to highly ionizing particles. As MMs and SMPs are highly ionizing, NTDs are perfectly suited for the purpose of detection.

It is an international research collaboration whose spokesperson is the [[University of Alberta]]'s James Pinfold. It is the seventh experiment at the LHC, was approved and sanctioned by the [[CERN]] research board on May 2010, and started its first test deployment in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pinfold |first=J. |date=5 May 2010 |title=MoEDAL becomes the LHC's magnificent seventh |url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/42329 |work=[[CERN Courrier]] |accessdate=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 MoEDAL accuracy surpassed accuracy of similar experiments. A new detector was installed in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acharya |first1=B. |display-authors=etal. |collaboration=MoEDAL Collaboration |year=2016 |title=Search for magnetic monopoles with the MoEDAL prototype trapping detector in 8 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC |arxiv=1604.06645 |doi=10.1007/JHEP08(2016)067 |volume=2016 |issue=8 |pages=67 |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|bibcode=2016JHEP...08..067A }}&lt;/ref&gt; but as of 2017 it also did not find any magnetic monopoles, setting new limits on their production cross section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.061801 |doi-access=free| pmid=28234515|title = Search for Magnetic Monopoles with the MoEDAL Forward Trapping Detector in 13&amp;nbsp;TeV Proton-Proton Collisions at the LHC| journal=Physical Review Letters| volume=118| issue=6| pages=061801|year = 2017|last1 = Acharya |first1 = B. |collaboration=MoEDAL Collaboration | displayauthors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Technicians carefully position an Orion flight test crew module.jpg|thumb|Technicians carefully position an Orion flight test crew module to be airlifted. This module will be used for the Orion Launch Abort System Pad Abort-1 flight test.]]

[[NASA]]'s newest spacecraft, the [[Orion spacecraft|Orion]] Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), will be the first American spacecraft since [[Project Apollo]] to use an escape system in the event of a launch abort, something its predecessor, the [[Space Shuttle]], had for only its first four orbital test flights in 1981-1982.  Like the [[Apollo Command-Service Module]] (CSM), the Orion CEV will use the [[Launch escape system]] (LES), a solid-fueled tractor rocket that will be able to pull the Orion crew module away from a malfunctioning [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) rocket during the initial launch phase.  Based on the launch escape system found on the [[Soviet]]/[[Russia]]n [[Soyuz spacecraft]], the LAS, designed and manufactured by [[Alliant Techsystems|ATK]] for the Orion CEV, will be larger than the Soyuz version and will have more thrust than the [[Friendship 7|Atlas 109-D]] booster that carried astronaut [[John Glenn]] into orbit in 1962.

The earlier Apollo system had various [[Apollo abort modes|abort modes]] depending on altitude, velocity, and other circumstances. Likewise the Orion will have similar modes of operation for its launch performance aborts. Some of these may not use the LAS itself, but would use the second stage of the Ares I, or even the Orion vehicle's own propulsion system (the [[Aerojet]] [[AJ-10]] engine) instead.

Initially designed to land on solid ground, like that of the early and current Soviet and Russian manned spacecraft ([[Vostok spacecraft|Vostok]], [[Voskhod spacecraft|Voskhod]], and Soyuz), with a water landing as a backup, in August 2007, NASA tentatively redesigned the Orion for water landings ([[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]]s) as the primary mode of landing, with ground landings as the emergency backup [https://web.archive.org/web/20120322014743/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news%2FAirbag061908.xml&amp;headline=Orion%20Landing%20Airbag%20In%20Works&amp;channel=space].  Under the advice of the [[Exploration Systems Architecture Study]] (ESAS) report, NASA will most likely develop abort procedures that resemble the abort procedures used on Apollo, but with some procedures carried over from the Shuttle.

== Modes ==
The method of abort, either using the LAS or the second stage of the [[Space Launch System]] booster, will depend on how far into the flight the spacecraft and crew are traveling.

===Prelaunch===
NASA has acquired several [[MRAP]]s to station near the launch pad, should there be time for the crew to evacuate the vehicle. One will be occupied by emergency rescue personnel, while the other will stand empty behind a [[blast shelter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/feature/mrap-rolls-through-pad-evacuation-runs-0 MRAP Rolls Through Pad Evacuation Runs]&lt;/ref&gt; Pad emergency egress enables astronauts and engineers to quickly escape the perimeter of the rocket. Both zip-lines and roller coasters were at one time studied for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/09/future-pad-escape-options-slidewires-roller-coasters/ nasaspaceflight.com], September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mode one ===
During the first 120 seconds of flight, up to the jettisoning of the solid-fueled boosters at {{convert|300000|ft|km}}, the Orion Crew Module (CM) will separate from the rest of the rocket propelled by the LAS.  Unlike the Apollo Launch Escape System, which used a pair of [[canard (aeronautics)|canards]] and the weight of the spacecraft to flip the vehicle over for landing, the Orion LAS has a set of steering rockets that will steer the spacecraft away from the malfunctioning [[Space Launch System|SLS]], as well as prepare the spacecraft for both separation and splashdown.  The tower will then be jettisoned 14 seconds later and the [[hypergolic]] fuel on the Orion CM would be automatically released at a pre-determined altitude.

=== Mode two ===
After the LAS is jettisoned, the Orion Crew and Service Modules (CSM) will separate as a whole from the SLS and either use its large AJ-10 engine or smaller control engines to maneuver from the rocket. Similar to a Space Shuttle [[Space Shuttle abort modes|trans-Atlantic]] (TAL) abort profile, the Orion will use the AJ-10 engine to propel the spacecraft to a desired separation point, in which then the Orion CM would land in either western [[Spain]] or [[Morocco]] on "due east" (i.e., lunar) flights, or in [[Ireland]] or the [[United Kingdom]] on [[International Space Station|ISS]]-bound flights. A splashdown in the eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]] would only be a contingency.

=== Mode three ===
The SLS would propel the Orion CSM into an initial orbit, upon which the spacecraft will immediately separate, and then perform a retrofire that will allow the Orion CM to splashdown in the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the U.S. West Coast, or make a ground landing at either [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in California or [[White Sands Space Harbor]] in New Mexico.  This is similar in profile to the Shuttle's ''Abort Once Around'' (AOA) profile.

=== Mode four ===
If the SLS suffers less-than-ideal performance during the initial orbit insertion, it can be restarted 45 minutes later to place the Orion CSM into a less than ideal orbit that can be corrected with the on-board propellant reserves later in the flight.  This is similar to the Shuttle's ''Abort To Orbit'' (ATO) profile, but depending upon the stable orbit reached, it may require NASA to end the mission with a landing at either Edwards or White Sands within a 24-hour period.

The four abort modes would also be used if the [[Max Launch Abort System]] (MLAS), a proposed alternative to the LAS, is flown in place of the LAS.  The MLAS, which resembles the LAS, but without the Soyuz-like rocket tower, uses a strengthened boost protective cover, but with the main rockets placed inside of the BPC itself.

'''Planctobacteria''' is a [[taxon]] created by [[Cavalier-Smith]], specifically a [[Division (botany)|division]] ([[phylum]]).&lt;ref group=note&gt;Historically bacteria were considered plants consequently the usage of "division" over "phylum" was brought over when the kingdom [[Monera]] was established. The [[bacteriological code]] has since imposed that the rank should be phylum and not division. Nevertheless, Cavalier-Smith adopts the term division.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not followed by the larger scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series=Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology|volume=4|title=The Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, Tenericutes (Mollicutes), Acidobacteria, Fibrobacteres, Fusobacteria, Dictyoglomi, Gemmatimonadetes, Lentisphaerae, Verrucomicrobia, Chlamydiae, and Planctomycetes|editor=George M.

==Molecular signatures==
These three groups in the [[Bacterial phyla|traditional molecular phylogeny view]] are considered as phyla and also cluster together in what is referred to as the '''PVC superphylum''', along with the [[candidate phyla]] OP3 and the Poribacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wagner | first1 = M. | last2 = Horn | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2006.05.005 | title = The Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, Chlamydiae and sister phyla comprise a superphylum with biotechnological and medical relevance | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–249 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16704931 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important molecular marker in the form of a [[conserved signature indel|conserved signature protein]] has been found to be consistently shared by PVC members, with the exception of [[Poribacteria]].

Recent studies have characterized this protein and it has been attributed to play an important housekeeping function in DNA/RNA binding.&lt;ref name=pmid24185849&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lagkouvardos I, Jehl MA, Rattei T, Horn M |title= Signature protein of the PVC superphylum |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=80|issue=2|pages=440–445 |date=2014|pmid=24185849 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02655-13|pmc=3911108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This observation not only provides a means to demarcate the PVC superphylum, but it supports strongly supports an evolutionary relationship shared by this clade that is distinct from other bacteria.&lt;ref name=Gupta2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gupta RS, Bhandari V, Naushad HS |title=Molecular Signatures for the PVC Clade (Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, Chlamydiae, and Lentisphaerae) of Bacteria Provide Insights into Their Evolutionary Relationships |journal=Front Microbiol |volume=3 |issue= |pages=327 |year=2012 |pmid=23060863 |pmc=3444138 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2012.00327 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid27279642&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gupta RS |title=Impact of genomics on the understanding of microbial evolution and classification: the importance of Darwin's views on classification |journal= FEMS Microbiol Rev |volume=40|issue=4|pages=520–53 |date=2016|pmid=27279642 |doi=10.1093/femsre/fuw011 |url=http://femsre.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/07/femsre.fuw011.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putrefying bacteria use [[amino acid]]s or [[urea]] as an energy source to decompose dead organisms. In the process, they produce [[ammonium]] ions.

'''Research Papers in Economics''' ('''RePEc''') is a collaborative effort of hundreds of volunteers in many countries to enhance the dissemination of [[research]] in [[economics]]. The heart of the project is a decentralized database of working papers, [[Preprint|preprints]], [[Academic journal|journal]] articles, and software components. The project started in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/p/bng/wpaper/11005.html A brief business history of an on-line distribution system for academic research called NEP, 1998-2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Its precursor NetEc dates back to 1993.

== Overview ==
Sponsored by the Research Division of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]] and using its IDEAS database, RePEc provides links to over 1,200,000 full text articles. Most contributions are freely downloadable, but copyright remains with the author or copyright holder. It is among the largest internet repositories of academic material in the world.

Materials to RePEc can be added through a department or institutional [[archive]] or, if no institutional archive is available, through the Munich Personal RePEc Archive. Institutions are welcome to join and contribute their materials by establishing and maintaining their own RePEc archive.

Leading publishers, such as [[Elsevier]] and [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], have their economics material listed in RePEc. RePEc collaborates with the [[American Economic Association]]'s [[EconLit]] database to provide content from leading universities' working paper or preprint series to EconLit. Over 1500 journals and over 3300 working paper series have registered, for a total of over 1.2 million articles, the majority of which are online.

The information in the database is used to rank the more than 50,000 registered economists. [[Andrei Shleifer]] is currently the highest ranked economist, followed by [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[James Heckman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html Top authors]&lt;/ref&gt; The economics department of [[Harvard University]] is ranked first, followed by the [[World Bank]] and the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.inst.all.html Top institutions]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]] is the top region, followed by the [[United Kingdom]] and [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.country.all.html Country and state rankings]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also rankings by country and sub-discipline.

RePEc also indexes worldwide economics institutions through its Economic Departments, Institutes and Research Centers in the World (EDIRC) database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edirc.repec.org/ EDIRC database]&lt;/ref&gt;

RePEc promotes [[Open Access journal]]s and also benefits from [[Open Access]] for its own [[citation analysis]] efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.repec.org/2012/10/26/about-open-access/ About Open Access - The RePEc Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15584">The '''Science Communication Observatory''' ({{lang-ca|Observatori de la Comunicació Científica}}, {{lang-es|Observatorio de la Comunicación Científica}}, OCC) is a Special Research Centre attached to the Department of Communication of the [[Pompeu Fabra University]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], set up in 1994. This centre is specialized in the study and analysis of the transmission of scientific, medical, environmental and technological knowledge to society. The journalist [[Vladimir de Semir]], associated professor of Science Journalism at the Pompeu Fabra University, was the funder and is the current director of the centre. A multidisciplinary team of researchers coming from different backgrounds (i.e. journalists, biologists, physicians, linguists, historians, etc.) is working on various lines of research: science communication; popularization of sciences, risk and [[crisis communication]]; science communication and knowledge representation; journalism specialized in science and technology; scientific discourse analysis; health and medicine in the daily press; relationships between science journals and mass media; history of science communication; public understanding of science; gender and science in the mass media, promotion of scientific vocations, science museology, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/rtdinfo/special_comm/03/article_3221_en.html "Between fast thinking and genuine culture"] Interview with V. de Semir in RTD Info - Magazine on European Research, November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== PCST Network &amp; Academy ==

The Science Communication Observatory is linked to the international network on '''Public Communication of Science &amp; Technology''' ([http://www.upf.edu/pcstacademy/_docs/PCSTleaflet.pdf PCST]), which includes individuals from around the world who are active in producing and studying PCST through science journalism, science museums and science centers, academic researchers in social and experimental sciences, scientists who deal with the public, public information officers for scientific institutions and others related to science in society issues. The PCST Network sponsors international conferences, [http://www.upf.edu/pcstacademy/PCST_Network/e_discussion.htm electronic discussions], and other activities to foster dialogue among the different groups of people interested in PCST, leading to cross-fertilization across professional, cultural, international, and disciplinary boundaries. The PCST Network seeks to promote new ideas, methods, intellectual and practical questions and perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upf.edu/pcstacademy/_docs/fayard.pdf The International Public Communication of Science and Technology Network]  Pierre Fayard, Paola Catapano and Bruce Lewenstein, June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The first conference held by the PCST Network was at Poitiers, France in 1989.  Since then biennial conferences have been held in Madrid (1991), Montreal (1994), Melbourne (1996), Berlin (1998), Geneva (2000), Cape Town (2002), Barcelona (2004), Seoul (2006), Malmo/Copenhagen (2008) and New Delhi (2010).  The 2012 conference is scheduled for Florence in 2012.

With events in Melbourne, Beijing, Seoul and Cape Town, the Network expanded from its European origins to become a truly international network.  The Scientific Committee managing the organisation is drawn from 19 different countries ranging across the globe. The Committee is chaired by Mr Toss Gascoigne (Australia).

The Science Communication Observatory hosts the '''PCST Academy'''. The [http://www.pcstacademy.org PCST Academy] is responsible for the creation of the documentary basis of the Public Communication of Science and Technology network (PCST) and its main task is the selection and organized collection of articles, reports and resources on particular topics in the field of communication and social understanding of sciences. As stated by the Chair of the Network from 2004 to 2006, Vladimir de Semir, the Academy looks for the necessary resources at international level to guarantee the access to the network of representatives from those countries that currently have to face more difficulties: “The main aim is to represent and include the multiplicity of identities existing in the world, because the study and practice of science communication should respect the different cultural contexts and integrate the knowledge coming from all continents.”

== Teaching, publishing and collaborative projects ==

The Science Communication Observatory runs a [http://www.idec.upf.edu/master-in-scientific-medical-and-environmental-communication Master in Science, Medical and Environmental Communication] in Barcelona (Spain) since 1995&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/08/01/Jcom0801%282009%29C01/Jcom0801%282009%29C02/Jcom0801%282009%29C02.pdf Master in Scientific, Medical and Environmental Communication] ''Journal of Science Communication'', March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and a Diploma in Science Communication in Buenos Aires (Argentina) since 2008 and other courses and workshops about science communication and the popularization of science. The Science Communication Observatory also publishes '''''Quark''''', [http://www.prbb.org/quark a journal] about “Science, Medicine, Communication and Culture”, and  also carries on researches and analysis in the Science in Society field, working with other European institutions and academic groups on several European projects such as:

•	'''PLACES''' - [http://www.openplaces.eu/ '''Platform of Local Authorities and Communicators Engaged in Science'''], a four-year European project establishing and developing the concept of the European City of Scientific Culture. [http://www.occ.upf.edu/img/imatges_cms/places_summary.pdf The project] focuses on developing and strengthening City Partnerships, bringing together 67 science centres, museums, festivals and events, each partnering with local authorities, and 10 European regional networks. The project facilitates cooperation among these alliances to structure their science communication activities, sharing tools, resources and results.

•	'''KiiCS''' - '''Knowledge Incubation in Innovation and Creation for Science''', the project aims to build bridges between arts, science and technology by giving evidence of the positive impacts of their interaction for creativity as well as for triggering interest in science. The project will stimulate co-creation processes involving creators and scientists, and nurture youth interest in science in a creative way. (KiiCS starts 15 February 2012)

•	'''MASIS''' - [http://www.masis.eu/ '''Monitoring Policy and Research Activities on Science in Society in Europe'''], project to develop structural links and interaction between scientists, policy-makers and society at large, therefore an instrumental tool in relation to stimulating further cooperation in Europe and reducing fragmentation through the identification of common resources, common trends, common interests, and common challenges.

•	'''ESCITY''' - [http://www.escity.org/ '''Europe, Science and the City: promoting scientific culture at local level'''], an initiative to create the core of a network for the exchange of information and best practices in the area of promoting scientific culture, with two particular characteristics; focusing on local and regional action and emplacing strategies that situate the promotion of scientific culture under the umbrella of cultural policies.

•	'''ESConet''' - [http://www.esconet.org/ '''European Science Communication Network'''], which brings together experienced science communication lecturers, researchers and practitioners from across Europe to train natural scientists and technologists to communicate effectively with the media, policy-makers and the general public. As well as delivering these core communication skills, [http://www.upf.edu/pcstacademy/_docs/ESConet2010.pdf ESConet workshops] encourage scientists to reflect critically on the social, cultural, and ethical dimensions of their scientific work.

•	'''E-KNOWNET''' -  [http://www.e-knownet.eu/ '''Network for ICT-enabled non-formal science learning'''], a project supported by the Lifelong Learning Programme of the European Commission to develop an innovative and viable ICT-enabled mechanism for fast and efficient sharing of new knowledge among larger non-expert segments of society, in forms suitable for non-formal learning.

•	'''STEPE''' - [http://www.stepe.eu '''Sensitive Technologies and European Public Ethics'''] project is innovative in contributing to the early identification of potentially controversial technological developments and related public ethics, by systematically considering both the view of key stakeholders in technological, political and societal life and the perceptions of European citizens in 25 European member states, thereby contextualising the findings by a systematic analysis of policy developments both on national and European levels. The interdisciplinary and multi-method approach will aim at establishing an integrated European Map of Public Ethics. It is the aim to stimulate new, empirically grounded, thinking on public ethics as a contribution to wider debates and policy making on responsible technological innovation. As a key data source, the proposal is based on the triennial Eurobarometer survey on the Biotechnology and the Life Sciences.

•	[http://www.upf.edu/pcstacademy/_docs/Benchmarking_the_promotion_of_RTD_culture_and_PUS.pdf '''Benchmarking the Promotion of RTD culture and Public Understanding of Science''']  to establish the current state of RTD culture in Member States, to provide a survey of the ongoing activities, and to recommend measures to be followed to improve the present situation. In order to clarify the meaning behind the vocabulary used in different Member States, our introduction also contains an analysis of the concepts behind
“Public Understanding of Science”, “Public Understanding of Science and the Humanities (Wissenschaft)” and “Culture Scientifique”.

==Scientific Knowledge and Cultural Diversity==

The Science Communication Observatory was responsible of the organization of the [http://www.barcelona2004.org/www.barcelona2004.org/eng/banco_del_conocimiento/dialogos/fichac1c7.html?IdEvento=153 8th International Conference of the PCST Network] in Barcelona (Spain), June 2004. The main theme of the conference was "Scientific Knowledge and Cultural Diversity" which opened up a field to debate on the global discourse of science in a range of local culture and knowledge environments. When talking about various cultures we are referring to the different groups sharing the same language, same traditions, ideology or religion, inhabiting in a specific geographical environment, having the same job, or being a man or a woman, a young, a child, an elder… All this rich cultural diversity also reflects its stamp on scientific knowledge, in its creation and application as well as in the whole process of public communication of science and technology.
The main theme of "Scientific Knowledge and Cultural Diversity", included 3 subthemes or discussion subjects.

'''Native Knowledge &amp; Modern Science'''
Cultural diversity. Traditional knowledge. Local wisdom. Regional identity and globalization. Indigenous knowledge system. Citizenship participation on scientific decisions. Popular culture and scientific culture. Possibilities of native knowledge facing with new technologies. Science ethics and believes. Religion or morality influence in knowledge construction. Cohabitation between medicines with different evaluation systems. Knowledge, religion and beliefs. Parasciences. Science as a universal knowledge Intellectual property. Gender and cultural approach. New models, trends and concepts in PCST.

'''Science Communication: Historical Perspectives And New Trends'''
Influences of historical processes on science communication. The greatest science communicators. The role of the mass media. The role of science centres and museums. Main initiatives in the promotion of scientific culture. Results analysis methodology. International networks. New models, trends and concepts in PCST.

'''Science Communication &amp; Social Participation'''
Peripheral science and science in the outskirts. Science culture and cooperation with illiterate population and marginal groups. Social inclusion. Public engagement with science policy (consensus conferences, citizen juries, deliberative polling). Science vocations in the changing world. Media impact on science opinion. Science festivals. Ethics of science communication. Public policies in scientific culture. Citizen participation on scientific decisions. Informal science education. Science centers and museums. Science communication training. New models, trends and concepts in PCST.

==European Forum on Science Journalism==

In December 2007, the Science Communication Observatory organized with the European Commission the '''European Forum on Science Journalism''' ([http://ec.europa.eu/research/conferences/2007/bcn2007/index_en.htm EFSJ]) where leading science journalists and editors of national newspapers and specialised science publications from across Europe and the world met in Barcelona to discuss the challenges in reporting on science, the impact of new technologies on the profession and importance of linking science to society and everyday life together with leading scientists and top science communication professionals from across Europe, the US, Canada, China and Australia.  A '''Special Eurobarometer on scientific research in the media''' and a '''European Guide to Science Journalism Training''' were presented in this forum.
How to strengthen science coverage in the European press? How to convince editors to run science stories? How to assess the trustworthiness of scientific research? How to explain science in an understandable fashion? How to stimulate public interest in science news?... These were among the key questions addressed at the first European Forum on Science Journalism.

== Media for Science Forum ==

In May 2010, the Science Communication Observatory was member of the scientific committee of the '''Media for Science Forum''' organised by the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology with the collaboration of the European Commission in the context of the Spanish Presidency of Europe 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occ.upf.edu/img/imatges_cms/2010_mfsf_metareview.pdf Science Communication &amp; Science Journalism] - Fecyt, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SS ''Mission San Fernando''''' was a [[Type T2-SE-A2 tanker|Type T2-SE-A2]] [[tank ship|tanker]] built for the [[United States Maritime Commission]] during World War II. After the war she was acquired by the [[United States Navy]] as '''USS ''Mission San Fernando'' (AO-122)'''. Later the tanker transferred to the [[Military Sea Transportation Service]] as '''USNS ''Mission San Fernando'' (T-AO-122)'''. She was a member of the {{sclass-|Mission Buenaventura|oiler||ship}} and was named for [[Mission San Fernando Rey de España]] in Los Angeles.  She was later renamed '''USNS ''Muscle Shoals'' (T-AGM-19)''' (after [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]]), and, later, '''USNS ''Vanguard'' (T-AG-194)'''.

==Service history==
===As oiler, 1943&amp;ndash;1957===
''Mission San Fernando'' was laid down on 26 August 1943 under a Maritime Commission contract by Marine Ship Corporation, [[Sausalito, California]]; launched on 25 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Ruth B. Krohn; and delivered on 29 February 1944. Chartered to Pacific Tankers Inc., for operations, she served the remainder of the War carrying fuel to Allied forces in the western [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] (during which time she was twice awarded the [[Battle Efficiency Award]] as well as the [[National Defense Service Medal]]). She remained in service until 10 May 1946 when she was returned to the Maritime Commission and laid up in the Reserve Fleet at [[Olympia, Washington]]. 

Acquired by the Navy on 21 October 1947 she was chartered to the [[Union Oil Company]] for operations and placed in service under the operational control of the Naval Transportation Service as ''Mission San Fernando'' (AO-122). Transferred to the operational control of the newly created Military Sea Transportation Service on 1 October 1949 she was redesignated USNS ''Mission San Fernando'' (T-AO-l22). She served in MSTS until 24 May 1955 when she was returned to the Maritime Administration and laid up in the Maritime Reserve Fleet at Olympia. She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 22 June 1955. 

Reacquired by the Navy on 21 June 1956 she was placed in service with MSTS and operated, under charter, by Marine Transportation Lines. She served with MSTS until she was returned to the Maritime Administration on 4 September 1957 and laid up in the Maritime Reserve Fleet at [[James River, Virginia]].

===As tracking and navigational test ship, 1964&amp;ndash;1999===
[[Image:USNS Vanguard.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Vanguard'' (T-AGM-19) seen here as a [[NASA]] Skylab tracking ship. Note the SatCom tracking radar and telemetry antennas.]]
Reacquired by the Navy on 28 September 1964 she was taken in hand by [[General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division]] for extensive modernization and rebuilding at its [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] yard.  This included adding 80 feet to her length. While under conversion to a [[Missile Range Instrumentation Ship|missile-range instrumentation ship]], she was renamed for [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]] and reclassified, becoming ''Muscle Shoals'' (AGM-19). Renamed ''Vanguard'' on 1 September 1965, she was placed in service with MSTS on 28 February 1966 as USNS ''Vanguard'' (T-AGM-19). Designed to be a seagoing missile tracking station, she participated in the [[Apollo Project]] test series and into 1969 had continued in these duties.  She then participated in the [[Skylab]] program and the joint US/Soviet [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]].

In September 1980, she was reconfigured and the large missile tracking antennas were removed.  She replaced the {{USS|Compass Island}} and reclassified as T-AG-194. Her role became that of a Navigational Test Ship and she was used to check submarine navigation systems. She steamed over 250,000 miles in support of [[UGM-73 Poseidon|Poseidon]] and [[UGM-96 Trident I|Trident I]] navigation subsystems and in development of the [[UGM-133 Trident II|Trident II]] navigation subsystem. She was stricken again on 12 December 1999 after being replaced by [[USNS Waters (T-AGS-45)|USNS ''Waters'' (T-AGS-45)]].&lt;ref name="SSP_facts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssp.navy.mil/about/history_facts_3.shtml |title=Functional Elements of the FBM System |work=Strategic Systems Programs Facts |publisher=Navy.mil |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803084643/http://www.ssp.navy.mil/about/history_facts_3.shtml |archivedate=3 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disposal===
On 29 November 2001 she was transferred to the [[United States Maritime Administration]] (MARAD). On 16 March 2005 MARAD issued a "Request for Comments" for public input on the historical significance of the ''Vanguard''.&lt;ref name="marad20050316"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marad.dot.gov/Headlines/announcements/2005/Public+Comment+on+Historic+Significance+of+Vessels/Grp4PAOdescription+ewk+rev.htm |title=Ships for Which we are Soliciting Comments from the Public |publisher=MARAD.dot.gov |date=16 March 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050526211438/http://marad.dot.gov/Headlines/announcements/2005/Public+Comment+on+Historic+Significance+of+Vessels/Grp4PAOdescription+ewk+rev.htm |archivedate=26 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following historical review, the vessel was cleared for disposal by the Virginia State Historic Preservation Office on 15 November 2006.

As of January, 2014 she is being recycled [http://navy.memorieshop.com/Vanguard/index.html] at Marine Metal Inc. recycle slip in Brownsville, Texas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7922">'''University spin-offs''' transform technological [[invention]]s developed from [[university]] [[research]] that are likely to remain unexploited otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Shane (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, university/academic spin-offs are a [[subcategory]] of [[research spin-off]]s. Prominent examples of university spin-offs are [[Genentech]], [[Crucell]], [[Lycos]] and [[Plastic Logic]]. In most countries, universities can claim the [[intellectual property]] (IP) rights on technologies developed in their [[Laboratory|laboratories]]. In the United States, the [[Bayh–Dole Act]] permits universities to pursue ownership of inventions made by researchers at their institutions using funding from the federal government, where previously federal research funding contracts and grants obligated inventors (wherever they worked) to assign the resulting IP to the government. This IP typically draws on [[patents]] or, in exceptional cases, [[copyrights]]. Therefore, the process of establishing the spin-off as a new [[Incorporation (business)|corporation]] involves transferring the IP to the new corporation or giving the latter a [[license]] on this IP. Most [[research universities]] now have [[Technology Licensing Office]]s (TLOs) to facilitate and pursue such opportunities.

== Critical steps in developing a spin-off ==

University spin-offs typically go through a number of critical steps to develop the initial invention into a successful business venture. The following steps are critical in creating a successful spin-off (not necessarily in this order).&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Vohora et al. (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Developing a [[proof of concept]], or [[proof of principle]], that demonstrates that the invented method or new [[theory]] is probably useful in a particular application - for example a new [[product (business)|product]].
* Developing a fully functioning [[prototype]] of this new product; the prototype also serves to learn about how to produce, use and sell the new product.
* Attracting startup funding to finance the development of prototypes and new products; this may involve acquiring financial resources from [[venture capital]] firms, [[angel Investors]], [[bank]]s, or other providers of early-stage [[financial capital]].
* Developing a successful [[business model]] for the spin-off; a business model depicts the rationale of how the spin-off will create, deliver and capture value.
* Acquiring the first [[customers]]. The first customer, also called an [[early adopter]], can provide candid feedback to help the spin-off refine future product releases and also provide access to a [[distribution channel]] or other forms of support.

== Conditions for spin-off creation ==

Some universities generate substantially higher numbers of spin-offs than others.&lt;ref&gt;Di Gregorio &amp; Shane (2003); Klofsten &amp; Jones-Evans (2000); Kondo (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Universities with high numbers of successful spin-offs …
* draw on university-wide [[awareness]] of entrepreneurial [[wiktionary:opportunity|opportunities]] and/or benefit from a strong entrepreneurship culture at the national or regional level;
* have developed a university culture that thrives on entrepreneurial [[role model]]s among their [[alumni]] and academic staff as well as successful spin-offs that serve as inspiring examples (e.g. [[Lycos]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]);
* actively stimulate the development of entrepreneurial talent and help founders of spin-offs obtain access to [[investors]], [[consultants]] and other forms of support; these activities are particularly critical in (e.g. continental European) countries that suffer from an entrepreneurial culture that is weaker than elsewhere (e.g. USA).&lt;ref&gt;Clarysse et al. (2005); Van Burg et al. (2008); Wright et al. (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other issues ==

University spin-off activity may give rise to potential [[conflict of interest]] between commercial and academic work. In addition, the university’s [[reputation]] may be at risk if founders of spin-offs act inappropriately.&lt;ref&gt;Bird et al. (1993); Shane (2004); Slaughter &amp; Rhoades (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the antagonism between academic research and technology commercialization by way of spin-offs is likely to create fairness issues, for example regarding the distribution of [[royalties]] or [[equity (finance)|equity]]. This antagonism can be managed by installing [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]] procedures for the spin-off formation process that enhance fair [[wiktionary:treatment|treatment]] of all participants.&lt;ref&gt;Van Burg et al. (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vasili Vasilyevich Pronchishchev''' ({{lang-ru|Василий Васильевич Прончищев}}) (1702–{{OldStyleDate|9 September|1736|29 August}}) was a [[Russia]]n explorer.

In 1718, Vasili Pronchishchev graduated from [[Moscow School of Mathematics and Navigation]] and was promoted to naval cadet. In 1733, he was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant]] and appointed head of one of the units of the [[Second Kamchatka Expedition]], the purpose of which was to map the shores of the [[Arctic Ocean]] from the mouth of the [[Lena River|Lena]] to the mouth of the [[Yenisey]]. 

In 1735, Vasili Pronchishchev went down the Lena River (from [[Yakutsk]]) on his [[sloop]] ''Yakutsk'', doubled its delta, and stopped for wintering at the mouth of the [[Olenek River]]. Many members of the crew fell ill and died, mainly owing to [[scurvy]]. Despite the difficulties, in 1736, he reached the eastern shore of the [[Taymyr Peninsula]] and went north along its coastline. Finally Pronchishchev and [[Maria Pronchishcheva|his wife Maria]] (also referred to as Tatyana Feodorovna) succumbed to scurvy and died on the way back.       

Despite the death toll, the expedition was successful regarding the fulfillment of its goals. During his journey, Vasili Pronchishchev discovered a number of islands off the northeastern coast of the Taymyr Peninsula ([[Faddey Islands]], [[Komsomolskoy Pravdy Islands]], [[Saint Peter Islands]]). His expedition was the first to accurately map the Lena River from Yakutsk to its estuary and the Laptev seacoast from the Lena's mouth to the Gulf of Faddey. Pronchishchev's wife '''Maria Pronchishcheva''' (died September 12(23), 1736), who took part in his expedition, is considered the first female polar explorer. After their deaths, both of them were interred at the mouth of the Olenek River.       

A part of the eastern coastline of the Taymyr Peninsula  and a ridge between the mouths of the Olenek and [[Anabar River]]s bear Vasili Pronchishchev's name.  Icebreaker ''Vasili Pronchishchev'', built in 1961 in Leningrad, was also named after this pioneering Arctic explorer. 

[[Maria Pronchishcheva Bay]] in the [[Laptev Sea]] is named after his wife Maria.
