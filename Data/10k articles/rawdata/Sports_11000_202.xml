'''Borough Park''' is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Workington]], [[England]]. The home ground of [[Workington A.F.C.]], it has a capacity of 3,101, of which 500 is seated.

==History==
Borough Park was built with the assistance of the local council, and opened in 1937, with Workington moving from their previous [[Lonsdale Park]] ground, which was next to Borough Park. The ground initially consisted of a 1,000-seat main stand on the western touchline, and banking around the remainder of the pitch, but by 1951 the embankments had been converted to terracing, and two more stands erected in the north-west and south-west corners of the ground.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Paul Smith &amp; Shirley Smith (2005) ''The Ultimate Directory of English &amp; Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005'', Yore Publications, p26, {{ISBN|0954783042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workington were elected to [[the Football League]] in 1951, and the first League match at Borough Park saw them defeat [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] 3–1 in front of 11,000 spectators. The ground underwent further expansion during the 1950s as the main stand was extended and the terracing on the eastern side of the pitch was roofed in 1956. The record attendance of 21,000 was set on 4 January 1958 for an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. The League record attendance of 18,628 was set for a local derby against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] on 26 December 1963.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

Workington were voted out of the League in 1977. The main stand was closed and the roof removed in 1988.&lt;ref name=UD/&gt;

Borough Park was also the home of the town's rugby league club [[Workington Town]] from when they formed after the [[Second World War]] in 1945 until they moved out in 1956 and into their own new ground nearby, [[Derwent Park]], where they remain today.

'''Broncos Stadium at Mile High''', previously known as '''Invesco Field at Mile High''' and '''Sports Authority Field at Mile High''', and commonly known as '''Mile High''', '''New Mile High''' or '''Mile High Stadium''', is an [[American football]] [[stadium]] in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]], named ''Mile High'' due to the city's elevation of {{convert|5,280|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stadium Elevation|url=http://www.sportsauthorityfieldatmilehigh.com/stadium-information/about-us/elevation-5280'|publisher=Sports Authority Field at Mile High|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary tenant is the [[Denver Broncos]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL).  It opened in 2001 to replace [[Mile High Stadium]] and was largely paid for by taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Chuck|title=Tax off books, but not registers|url=http://www.denverpost.com/murphy/ci_19832010?IADID=Search-www.denverpost.com-www.denverpost.com|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Denver Post|date=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfsd.com/aboutus.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018222123/http://mfsd.com/aboutus.html |archivedate=2013-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Invesco]] paid $120&amp;nbsp;million for the original naming rights, before [[Sports Authority]] secured them in 2011.&lt;ref name="ANewHome"&gt;{{cite news|last=Caldwell|first=Gray|title=A New Home|url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/A-New-Home/14d4a137-b809-4347-9eef-bfdf909b6106|publisher=Denver Broncos|date=August 16, 2011|accessdate=September 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908035605/http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/A-New-Home/14d4a137-b809-4347-9eef-bfdf909b6106|archive-date=2017-09-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its sponsor's [[liquidation]] and closure in 2016, the Sports Authority name remained on the stadium for two years afterward because of regulatory hurdles. Nevertheless, the Broncos announced on January 2, 2018 that the stadium's exterior signage would be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DiLalla|first=Aric|title=Broncos to remove Sports Authority signage from stadium in coming weeks|url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Broncos-to-remove-Sports-Authority-signage-from-stadium-in-coming-weeks/76176de0-7491-4219-91af-6748bb10aeb2|publisher=Denver Broncos|date=January 2, 2018|accessdate=January 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109183301/http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Broncos-to-remove-Sports-Authority-signage-from-stadium-in-coming-weeks/76176de0-7491-4219-91af-6748bb10aeb2|archive-date=2018-01-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium took on its current name on a temporary basis on June 20, 2018 after the city's stadium authority approved the change, hoping to resell naming rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DiLalla|first=Aric|title='Broncos Stadium at Mile High' approved as temporary name for stadium|url=https://www.denverbroncos.com/news/broncos-stadium-at-mile-high-approved-as-temporary-name-for-stadium|publisher=Denver Broncos|date=June 20, 2018|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Renck|first1=Troy E.|last2=Miller|first2=Blair|title=Denver Broncos' stadium temporarily renamed 'Broncos Stadium at Mile High'|url=https://www.thedenverchannel.com/sports/broncos/denver-broncos-request-new-temporary-name-for-stadium|website=TheDenverChannel.com|date=June 20, 2018|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming rights controversy==
Many fans opposed a [[naming rights|corporate name]] and wished to retain the previous venue's name, "Mile High Stadium."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poynter.org/dg.lts/id.5015/content.content_view.htm|title=A Mile High Controversy|first=Gregory E.|last=Favre|date=August 10, 2006|accessdate=September 25, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127001741/http://www.poynter.org/dg.lts/id.5015/content.content_view.htm|archivedate=November 27, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Denver Post]]'' initially refused to use the [[Invesco]] label and referred to it as Mile High Stadium for several years before changing its policy and adding Invesco to articles.

On August 16, 2011, the Metropolitan Stadium District announced Invesco would immediately transfer the naming rights to [[Englewood, Colorado]]-based [[Sports Authority]] in a 25-year agreement worth $6&amp;nbsp;million per year.&lt;ref name="ANewHome" /&gt; In August of 2016, the Denver Broncos paid $3,601,890 to the Metropolitan Football Stadium District to purchase the naming rights to the stadium.&lt;ref name="SportsAuthorityBankruptcy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zellinger|first1=Marhsall|date=May 31, 2016|title=Denver Broncos awarded Mile High Stadium naming rights during Sports Authority bankruptcy case|url=https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/denver-broncos-awarded-mile-high-stadium-naming-rights-during-sports-authority-bankruptcy-case/|publisher=''The Denver Channel''|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101101045/http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/denver-broncos-awarded-mile-high-stadium-naming-rights-during-sports-authority-bankruptcy-case|archive-date=1 November 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, several Colorado legislators attempted to pass a bill in the [[Colorado State Legislature]] that would require the "Mile High" moniker regardless of any naming rights deal, citing the large public contribution to the stadium's construction;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bunch |first=Joey |date=August 23, 2016 |title=Bill would forever preserve "Mile High" in Broncos' stadium name |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_29816233/bill-would-forever-preserve-mile-high-broncos-stadium |newspaper=The Denver Post |accessdate=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bill failed to pass out of a Senate Committee in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bunch |first=Joey |date=May 5, 2016 |title=Senate Republicans kill bill to retain "Mile High" in stadium's name |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_29855852/senate-republicans-kill-bill-retain-mile-high-stadiums |newspaper=The Denver Post |accessdate=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The stadium is used primarily for [[American football]] games. It is the home field for Denver's [[National Football League]] team, the [[Denver Broncos]]. The stadium also hosts the city's [[Major League Lacrosse]] team, the [[Denver Outlaws]]. In college football it has hosted the [[Rocky Mountain Showdown|rivalry game]] between the [[Colorado State University]] [[Colorado State Rams football|Rams]] and the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Buffaloes]]. It is also used for the [[Colorado High School Activities Association|CHSAA]] class 4A and 5A Colorado high school football state championship games, and has been used for the CBA Marching Band Finals.

In addition, it has been used for the [[Drum Corps International]] (DCI) Championships in 2004 and the annual Drums Along the Rockies competition. It is also used for concerts, music festivals and other events, and was home to the city's [[Major League Soccer]] franchise, the [[Colorado Rapids]], before that team built and moved into [[Dick's Sporting Goods Park]] in suburban [[Commerce City, Colorado|Commerce City]].

On the 23rd June 2018 England defeated New Zealand 36-18 in [[Rugby League]].

==Location==
The construction of the stadium marked the completion of a six-year sporting venue upgrade program in Denver, including the construction of [[Coors Field]] and of [[Pepsi Center]]. As with the other venues, the stadium was constructed to be easily accessible. It sits along [[Interstate 25]] near the [[Colfax Avenue]] and 17th Avenue exits. It is also bordered by Federal Boulevard, a major Denver thoroughfare, on the west side. A dedicated [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High (RTD)|light rail station]] also serves the stadium. The stadium is located in the [[Sun Valley, Denver|Sun Valley neighborhood]].

==Stadium culture and traditions==

A home game tradition (carried over from the original [[Mile High Stadium]]) is the "Incomplete Chant." At Bronco home games, when the opposing team throws an incomplete pass, the stadium announcer will state "Pass thrown by [the opposing quarterback] intended for [the opposing intended receiver] is..." at which time the fans complete the sentence by shouting "IN-COM-PLETE!!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/footer/faq.html |title=FAQ |work=Denver Broncos |access-date=2014-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819010506/http://www.denverbroncos.com/footer/faq.html |archive-date=2014-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium has sold out every [[Denver Broncos]]' home game since its inception in {{nfly|2001}}, extending the "sold-out" streak that began during the team's tenure at Mile High Stadium, where every home game had been sold out since {{nfly|1970}} (though due to [[National Football League|NFL]] policy, local TV broadcasts of sold-out games did not start until {{nfly|1973}}). In a tradition carried over from Mile High Stadium, the stadium's public-address announcer will give the final official attendance for the game, including the number of unused tickets; in response, Broncos fans "boo" the no-shows.

During the stadium's first years, in another tradition was carried over from Mile High, Broncos fans on one side of the stadium would chant "Go" and fans on the other side would respond "Broncos," back and forth chanting for several minutes. That tradition has since died out. Another long-term tradition is famed rowdiness of fans seated in the "South Stands,"  although this tradition has diminished significantly as well.

Finally, especially in the upper two decks, the fans create their own 'Mile High Thunder' (and warm themselves) by stamping their feet on the stadium's floors. The old Mile High Stadium was built with bare metal, and the 'Thunder' reverberated readily. The new stadium was built with steel floors to preserve this unique acoustic feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The New And Improved Mile High |url=http://www.stadiumjourney.com/stadiums/sports-authority-field-at-mile-high-s66/ |work=Stadium Journey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2012, the Broncos announced a [[Dollar|$]]30&amp;nbsp;million renovation project prior to the start of the [[2013 Denver Broncos season|2013]] season, including a new high-definition [[Light emitting diode|LED]] video board on the stadium's south end zone that triples the size of the old video board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Klis, Mike |title=Broncos, Stadium District to spend $30 million on Mile High improvements |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_22241443/broncos-stadium-district-spend-30-million-stadium-improvements |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=December 21, 2012 |accessdate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, it was revealed that a [[Neil Smith (American football)|Neil Smith]] [[Kansas City Chiefs]] jersey was buried somewhere near the 50-yard line by a couple of out-of-state contractors during renovations, despite Smith's play on the Broncos' [[Super Bowl XXXII]] and [[Super Bowl XXXIII|XXXIII]]-winning teams. The curse the contractors hoped to create did not occur as the Broncos won another Super Bowl two years later, [[Super Bowl 50]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefox.com/pages/LandF.html?article=11830461|title=Troy claims a secret lies beneath the 50 yard line... {{!}} The Rick Lewis Show {{!}} 103.5 The Fox|website=103.5 The Fox|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101080916/http://www.thefox.com/pages/LandF.html?article=11830461|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium has hosted other sports events. The first football game held was the [[Rocky Mountain Showdown]], when the [[2001 Colorado Buffaloes football team|University of Colorado Buffaloes]] defeated the [[Colorado State Rams football|Colorado State University Rams]] 41–14. On July 2, 2005, it hosted the 2005 [[Major League Lacrosse All-Star Game]]. In 2006, [[Major League Lacrosse]] placed the expansion [[Denver Outlaws|Outlaws]] in Denver.

In August 2004, it hosted the [[Drum Corps International]] (DCI) World Championships, and every July hosts [[Drums Along the Rockies]], which is a major competition in the annual DCI summer tour. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dci.org/about/champions|title=Drum Corps International Past Champions and Locations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ascendperformingarts.org/events/datr/|title=Drums Along The Rockies|date=2014-08-13|work=Ascend Performing Arts|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denver Broncos Ring of Fame==
The Denver Broncos Ring of Fame was created in 1984 by team owner Pat Bowlen to honor former players and administrators who played significant roles in the franchise's history. The names and years of service (and in most cases, jersey numbers) of the men inducted into the ring are displayed on the Level 5 facade of the stadium.  There is no specific number of new members that may be chosen for induction in any given year; in many years, no new members were inducted.

While the Ring of Fame was carried over from the old stadium to the new, the names were re-ordered to separate the inductees who served the team during the pre-[[Pat Bowlen]] (the team's current owner and founder of the Ring) era from those who served during Bowlen's ownership. One of the most noticeable changes was the move of [[John Elway]]'s name to the center of the ring, located directly between the goalposts of the north end zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denver-rmn.com/invesco/bowlen.shtml|title=Kickoff: Birth of a Stadium|first=Kyle|last=Ringo|accessdate=November 30, 2006|newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060722000424/http://www.denver-rmn.com/invesco/bowlen.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=July 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Butcher's Arms Ground''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Droylsden]], [[Tameside]], [[Greater Manchester]], [[England]].  It is currently used mostly for [[Association football|football]] matches and is the home ground of [[Droylsden F.C.]]. The stadium has a capacity of 3,000 people both seated and standing and is nicknamed "The Slaughterhouse" or "Abattoir" by fans. The ''Butchers'' reference is celebrated at a designated home game once a year, when the stadium floor is sprinkled with saw dust and fans are invited to wear white overalls and hairnets. During Droylsden's recent F.A. Cup tie against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], broadcast live on ESPN, two fans invaded the pitch at the end of the match dressed as butchers. It has partial or full cover on three sides of the pitch, terracing on four sides and seating along the centre of one side, plus a [[public house]].

The ground is named after the Butcher's Arms public house, whose landlord in 1892 instigated the formation of Droylsden FC to play on land behind the pub, which became the ground. After the [[Second World War]] the lease of the Butchers Arms was sold to Belle Vue F.C., who renamed themselves Droylsden United. And that club took over playing at the ground, forcing Drolysden to move to the nearby [[Moorside, Oldham|Moorside]] Trotting Stadium. However, the town wasn't big enough for two clubs, especially with bad feeling between them, and after the local council bought the ground, a merger was negotiated and Drolysden returned to the Butcher's Arms ground in 1952, after it had been renovated and the pitch had been rotated to its present position, finally eradicating a long-standing drainage problem.

The record attendance is 4,250 for an [[FA Cup]] first round match between Droylsden and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in 1976.

The '''Canadian Association for Stock Car Auto Racing''' ('''CASCAR''') was the governing body for amateur and professional [[Stock car racing|stock car]] racing in [[Canada]].

==History==
Established in 1981 by President Anthony Novotny, CASCAR boasted the highest level of stock car racing in Canada and sanctioned Canada's only national stock car racing series, the [[CASCAR Super Series]].

On November 16, 2004, CASCAR announced it had entered a multi-year operational and marketing agreement with [[NASCAR]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar/news/nascar-enters-alliance-with-cascar/|title=CASCAR enters agreement with NASCAR|publisher=motorsport.com|accessdate=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; after NASCAR had formed [[NASCAR Canada]] earlier in the year.

This also opened the way for NASCAR's purchase of CASCAR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060214230927/http://www.autonet.ca/Motorsports/story.cfm?story=/Motorsports/NASCAR/2005/11/26/1325184-sun.html]
Jim Cressman, [[London Free Press]] "NASCAR close to buying CASCAR", accessed January 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2006, NASCAR completed its purchase of CASCAR and announced the [[NASCAR Canadian Tire Series]], a series of 10–12 races from May–October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tsn.ca/auto_racing/news_story/?ID=177222&amp;hubname= TSN.ca staff, "NASCAR launches series in Canada" September 12, 2006, Retrieved January 1, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2015, it was announced that Pinty's Delicious Foods Inc. was the new sponsor of the series after Canadian Tire announced on February 17, 2015 that they were not renewing their sponsorship after the 2015 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pappone|first=Jeff|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/news/motorsports/canadian-tire-looking-to-end-partnership-with-canadian-nascar-series/article23023894/|title=Canadian Tire ending partnership with Canadian NASCAR series|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=February 17, 2015|accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://hometracks.nascar.com/ncats/story/pintys-sponsor-canadian-series_12072015|title = Pinty's To Sponsor Canadian Series|date = December 7, 2015|accessdate = December 7, 2015|publisher = NASCAR Media Group|website = NASCAR.com|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211113543/http://hometracks.nascar.com/ncats/story/pintys-sponsor-canadian-series_12072015|archivedate = December 11, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automobiles==
Unlike NASCAR, which mandates the use of steel-bodied shells, CASCAR-approved cars consisted of fiberglass bodyshells covering custom-made tube-frame racing chassis.

However, as in NASCAR, CASCAR cars' engines were [[Carburetor|normally aspirated]], pushrod [[V8 engine|V8]] units producing approximately {{convert|500|hp}}.

==Race courses==
CASCAR events were held on [[Short track motor racing|short track]] ovals, permanent road courses, temporary road courses and street courses.

Founded in [[1943 in sports|1943]], it competed in the [[Tunisian Men's Volleyball League]] where it enjoyed some success, especially in the 1980s and 1990s.

'''''Dear Hank &amp; John''''' is a [[podcast]] hosted by the [[Green brothers]]: musician and [[YouTube]] entrepreneur [[Hank Green]] and [[Young adult fiction|young-adult]] novelist and [[film producer]], [[John Green (author)|John Green]]. The podcast is produced and edited by Nicholas Jenkins with additional help from [[Rosianna Halse Rojas]]. First released in June 2015, Hank and John Green answer questions e-mailed by listeners, give "dubious" advice and talk about the weekly news for the planet [[Mars]] and the 3rd tier [[Football in England|English football]] club [[AFC Wimbledon]]. Episodes are typically around 45 minutes in length.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dear-hank-john/id1002937870?mt=2|title=Dear Hank &amp; John by Hank Green and John Green on iTunes|website=iTunes|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/06/19/vlogbrothers-launch-their-own.html|title=Vlogbrothers launch their own podcast|date=2015-06-19|website=Boing Boing|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the podcast's debut, it reached the number 4 position on the [[United States|US]] [[iTunes]] performance chart and hit a peak position of number 2 two days later. ''Dear Hank &amp; John'' has also been charted on iTunes in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]], [[Australia]] and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itunescharts.net/us/artists/podcast/dear-hank-john/podcasts/dear-hank-john/|title=iTunesCharts.net: 'Dear Hank &amp; John' by Dear Hank &amp; John (American Podcasts iTunes Chart)|website=www.itunescharts.net|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The podcast is primarily funded through the crowdfunding website [[Patreon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.patreon.com/dearhankandjohn?ty=h|title=Dear Hank and John is creating Dubious Advice {{!}} Patreon|website=Patreon|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the majority of the  pledges go towards the video production budget of [[Complexly]]. Since November 2018, the podcast is a co-production of Complexly and [[WNYC Studios]].

The podcast follows a general format which starts with an opening section. It usually changes every two or three months. As of now (ep. 148), John tries to give good news and Hank tells a “dad joke”. The main portion of the show then has the brothers offering comedic advice to questions received from listeners. Usually, at some point in the question segment, the brothers 'plug' various 'sponsors' of the show in a humorous manner that references topics from that week. The show then moves to the news segment, with Hank delivering the news about [[Mars]] and John the news about the [[AFC Wimbledon]] football club. Finally, the brothers discuss 'what they learned today', before reading the credits at the show's close.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dear Hank and John|title=Dear Hank and John 001 - The Debut: Do You Pee on Your Own Head?|date=2016-01-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYcyYh-sTj0|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers' schedule has sometimes led them to miss several episodes (notably for John during the summer of 2015 due to the ''[[Paper Towns (film)|Paper Towns]]'' publicity tour, and for Hank in late 2016 for his paternity leave); various friends of the brothers have filled in for each missing host on those occasions.

In March 2017, a 'bonus' supplemental podcast, titled ''This Week in Ryans'', started to become available for those who support the podcast on [[Patreon]] at the $5/month level or higher. In each episode, a person or thing named Ryan is selected to be discussed and analyzed by the hosts in a short segment.

An exclusive Dear Hank &amp; John episode has been made as a perk for the annual [[Project for Awesome]] fundraising campaign&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypable.com/project-for-awesome-2015/|title=The Project for Awesome 2015 kicks off today|date=2015-12-11|website=Hypable|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2015/12/03/john-green-dftba-p4a-nerdfighters-tfios-podcast-indianapolis/76721118/|title=Annual 'Awesome' fundraiser on deck for John Green|website=Indianapolis Star|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; each year since 2015.

== Live Performances ==

On John's book tour for ''[[Turtles All the Way Down (novel)|Turtles All the Way Down]]'' (October 10 - November 2, 2017) the Green brothers put on about a two hour long performance filled with monologues, silly songs, and a live version of Dear Hank &amp; John.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.turtlesallthewaydownbook.com/#tour|title=Turtles All The Way Down Tour|last=|first=|date=|website=www.turtlesallthewaydownbook.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This live production of their podcast included taking real questions from real Nerdfighters who were in attendance in the audience at that particular stop of the tour. Segments that were recorded across the tour were later edited into a single podcast, and released as its 114th episode.

== Platforms ==

Dear Hank and John is available to listeners on a multitude of platforms. Most commonly streamed on [[iTunes]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the podcast also has thousands of "views" on the Dear Hank and John [[YouTube]] page&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCldoL0vMV7hkUPIauUY4IjA|title=Dear Hank and John Youtube Channel|last=|first=|date=|website=www.YouTube.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they upload episodes several days after the initial release on iTunes. The podcast has also been released on audio websites like [[SoundCloud]], PodBay.fm, and many other podcast related websites.

==League History==

The league was started in 1979, when Doc Cody and Ron McCartney petitioned the City for a more permanent baseball facility for amateur players over the age of 18. At that time, the three original teams in the league: the Cardinals, Caseys &amp; Odeons played out of Optimist Park before it was decided they needed to do something about the need for more playing space.

In true Calgary form, volunteers from the community stepped forward and offered to construct a major league size park on City land. The main sponsor and benefactor was Jim Wilfley, with able assistance from other sports enthusiasts such as Hank Bassen, Gem-Sod, [[Alberta Treasury Branch]], [[Coca-Cola]], Conmac and others. The park was built on traditional ball park lines with wooden fences, stands and a press box. The project was started in the Fall of 1982 and finished in August 1984. The entire facility was built with donated labor and funding. The league opened for play, debt free, thanks to the dedicated generosity of its sponsors.

The first president was Ron McCartney. Glen Hansen took over in 1982. Many people over the years have contributed their volunteer efforts to keep the league going.

In 1991, the facility was partially destroyed by a fire set by vandals. The reconstruction work that followed changed the appearance of the park radically as all the wooden fences and structures were removed in favor of vandal-proof facilities. The present facility was reconstructed under the presidency of Ray Brisson with funds from the fire insurance and a generous grant from the Saddledome Foundation.

'''Geoffrey Norman Blainey''' {{postnominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|AC|FAHA|FASSA}} (born 11 March 1930) is an Australian historian, academic, philanthropist and commentator with a wide international audience. He is noted for having written authoritative texts on the economic and social [[history of Australia]], including ''[[The Tyranny of Distance: How Distance Shaped Australia's History|The Tyranny of Distance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/68731/Geoffrey-Blainey Encyclopædia Britannica Online – ''Geoffrey Blainey'']; web 22 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He has published over 35 books, including wide-ranging histories of the world and of Christianity. He has  often appeared in newspapers and on television.&lt;ref name="BBC: Professor Geoffrey Blainey"&gt;[http://www.bbcentertainment.com.au/artist-detail390/professor-geoffrey-blainey/ BBC: ''Professor Geoffrey Blainey''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511010859/http://www.bbcentertainment.com.au/artist-detail390/professor-geoffrey-blainey/ |date=11 May 2013 }}; 22 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="australianoftheyear.org.au"&gt;[http://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/honour-roll/?view=fullView&amp;recipientID=198 Australian of the Year Awards Honour Roll]; State Finalist Senior Australian of the Year 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.gov.au/funding/awards/pmla/2012/shortlists/non-fiction/short-history-of-christianity Prime Minister's Literary Awards – 2012 Shortlist] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426210609/http://arts.gov.au/funding/awards/pmla/2012/shortlists/non-fiction/short-history-of-christianity |date=26 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He held chairs in economic history and history at the [[University of Melbourne]] for over 20 years.&lt;ref name="BBC: Professor Geoffrey Blainey"/&gt; In the 1980s, he was visiting professor of [[Australian Studies]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="australianoftheyear.org.au"/&gt; He received the 1988 Britannica Award for dissemination of knowledge and was made a [[Companion of the Order of Australia]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="australianoftheyear.org.au"/&gt;

He was once described by Professor Graeme Davison as the "most prolific, wide-ranging, inventive, and, in the 1980s and 1990s, most controversial of Australia's living historians".&lt;ref&gt;Essay on "Blainey" by Professor Graeme Davison, "The Oxford Companion to Australian History", Oxford Univ. Press, 1998, p. 74)&lt;/ref&gt; He has been chairman or member of a wide range of Australian Government and other institutional councils, boards and committees, including the [[Australia Council]], the [[University of Ballarat]], the Australia-China Council, the [[Commonwealth Literary Fund]] and the [[Australian War Memorial]].&lt;ref name="BBC: Professor Geoffrey Blainey"/&gt; He chaired the National Council for the Centenary of Federation.&lt;ref name="BBC: Professor Geoffrey Blainey"/&gt; His name sometimes appears in lists of the most influential Australians, past or present.&lt;ref&gt;"100 Most Influential Australians" in Sydney Morning Herald, 22 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Bulletin, Sydney, 26 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Australia's 100 Living National Treasures", National Trust of NSW, 1997, 2004, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust]] lists Blainey as one of Australia's "[[Australian Living Treasures|Living Treasures]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/11/17/1069027042698.html ''Our Living Treasures'']; [[the Age]], 18 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He currently serves on the boards of philanthropic bodies, including the [[Ian Potter Centre|Ian Potter Foundation]] since 1991 and the Deafness Foundation Trust since 1993, and is patron of others.

Biographer Geoffrey Bolton argues that he has played multiple roles as an Australian historian:
::He first came to prominence in the 1950s as a pioneer in the neglected field of Australian business history....He produced during the 1960s and 1970s a number of surveys of Australian history in which explanation was organized around the exploration of the impact of the single factor (distance, mining, pre-settlement Aboriginal society).... Blainey next turned to the rhythms of global history in the industrial period.... Because of his authority as a historian, he was increasingly in demand as a commentator on Australian public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey  Bolton,  "Geoffrey Blainey" in Kelly Boyd, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol 1'' (1999) pp 93-95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Blainey was born in [[Melbourne]] and raised in a series of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n country towns before attending [[Wesley College, Melbourne|Wesley College]] and the [[University of Melbourne]]. While at university he resided at [[Queen's College (University of Melbourne)|Queen's College]], and was editor of ''[[Farrago (newspaper)|Farrago]]'', the newspaper of the [[University of Melbourne Student Union]].

===Writing===
After graduating from university, Blainey took a free-lance writing assignment and travelled to the Mount Lyell mining field in Tasmania.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/68731/Geoffrey-Blainey Encyclopædia Britannica Online – ''Geoffrey Blainey''; web 22 Apr 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; This first major project in the 1950s was, as an author and researcher working on the history of the [[Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company]], at [[Queenstown, Tasmania]], when a significant number of the older residents could remember the beginnings of the community. The resultant book is the only  local and regional history in Australia to achieve six editions, each being updated.&lt;ref&gt;St. David’s Park Publishing in Hobart acquired the rights from Melbourne University Press in 1993 and produced two more editions, the last of which sold out in 2011. See 1993 edition for details.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Blainey published his first book, ''[[The Peaks of Lyell]]''.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; He then wrote a history of his university: ''The University of Melbourne: A Centenary Portrait'' (1956).&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

Blainey has published over 35 books,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/gadfly-geoffrey-blainey-comes-to-praise-christianity-not-to-bury-it/story-e6frg8n6-1226179886632 ''Gadfly Geoffrey Blainey comes to praise Christianity, not to bury it '']; [[The Australian]]; 29 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; including his highly acclaimed ''[[A Short History of the World (Geoffrey Blainey)|A Short History of the World]]''. His works have ranged from sports and local histories to interpreting the motives behind the British settlement of Australia in ''[[The Tyranny of Distance: How Distance Shaped Australia's History|The Tyranny of Distance]]''; covering over two centuries of human conflict in ''The Causes of War'' (1973); examining the optimism and pessimism in Western society since 1750 in ''The Great See-Saw''; Aboriginal Australia in ''Triumph of the Nomads'' (1975) and ''A Land Half Won'' (1980); and his exploration of the history of Christianity in ''A Short History of Christianity'' (2011). He has also written general histories of the world and the "tempestuous" 20th century.

Throughout the course of his career, Blainey has also written for newspapers and television. ''The Blainey View'' was a history of Australia shown in ten episodes on ABC television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbcentertainment.com.au/artist-detail390/professor-geoffrey-blainey/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511010859/http://www.bbcentertainment.com.au/artist-detail390/professor-geoffrey-blainey/ |archivedate=11 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
In 1961, he began teaching economic history at the University of Melbourne, was made a professor in 1968, and was given the Ernest Scott chair in history in 1977.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; In 1982 he was appointed dean of Melbourne's Faculty of Arts. From 1994 to 1998, Blainey was foundation Chancellor of the [[University of Ballarat]].&lt;ref name="UBH"&gt;{{cite web | last = Wickham | first = Dorothy | year = 2005 | url = http://www.ballarat.edu.au/fdp/history/honour-roll/honourroll_Blainey,Geoffrey.shtml | title = Professor Emeritus Geoffrey Blainey (1930–); Historian and author; Foundation Chancellor of the University of Ballarat | work = UB Honour Roll | publisher = University of Ballarat | accessdate = 11 February 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060914193821/http://ballarat.edu.au/fdp/history/honour-roll/honourroll_Blainey,Geoffrey.shtml | archive-date = 14 September 2006 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was visiting professor of Australian Studies at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the academic field, he was on the board of the [[Melbourne University Press]] in the early 1960s, deputy dean of the Economics Faculty in the early 1970s, president of the council of Queen's College in the University of Melbourne from 1971 to 1989, and on the national selection committee for the [[Harkness Fellowship]]s from 1977 to 1989 (chairman 1983–89).&lt;ref&gt;Who’s Who in Australia, 2013, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy and public service===
Blainey was invited by Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]] in 1967 to sit on the advisory board of the Commonwealth Literary Fund, serving until its abolition in 1973 (chairman 1971–73). He then became inaugural chairman of the Literature Board of the Australia Council for the Arts (Later called Australia Council), set up by the [[Whitlam government]]. He served on the Council from 1977–1981.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; Following Whitlam's election promise to introduce a Public Lending Right Scheme for authors, Blainey was appointed chairman of the committee representing authors, publishers and librarians that, in 1973, recommended the scheme adopted by the government a year later. Australia's scheme differed from the pioneering scheme adopted in Denmark in 1946. Blainey represented writers on the small group instructed to find the new national anthem that Whitlam had promised. From that initiative came a public poll supporting the long-standing Australian patriotic song, "[[Advance Australia Fair]]".&lt;ref&gt;Australian Council for the Arts: First Annual Report, Jan.-Dec. 1973, and linked press releases&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1973, Blainey was an Australian delegate to the first [[UNESCO]] conference held in Asia, in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Java]]; it recommended cultural policies for Asia.

Blainey was deputy chairman in 1974 and 1975 of the Whitlam government's Inquiry into Museums and National Collections, whose report ultimately led to the completion in Canberra, in 2001, of the [[National Museum of Australia]] with its emphasis on indigenous history.&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in Australia, various editions since 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Inquiry's report had been drafted by Blainey and his colleague, Professor JD Mulvaney.
 
In 1976, he became an inaugural commissioner on the Australian Heritage Commission, set up by the Fraser government to decide on conservation and environmental matters. On the first council of the National Museum set up by the [[Hawke Government]] in 1984 he was a short-term member.

He was chairman of the [[Australia Council]] for four years and Chairman of the [[Australia-China Council]] from its inception in 1979 until June 1984. In 2001, he was the Chairman of the National Council for the Centenary of Federation. From 1994 to 1998, he was the Foundation Chancellor of the [[University of Ballarat]].&lt;ref name="UBH"/&gt;

In 2001, Blainey presented the [[Boyer Lectures]] on the theme ''This Land is all Horizons: Australian Fears and Visions''.&lt;ref name="Boyer"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/boyerlectures/stories/2001/1715576.htm | title = This Land is all Horizons: Australian Fears and Visions| work = Boyer Lectures | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate = 11 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Howard government]], he served as a member of the council of the [[Australian War Memorial]] in Canberra from 1997 to 2004, an appointment initially criticised in parliament by [[Laurie Brereton]] of the Labor opposition but approved  in other circles. There was no opposition when his first three-year term was renewed. 
 
At the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)#1998 convention|Constitutional Convention]], held in Canberra for 10 days in February 1998 to debate and vote on whether Australia should become a republic (and if so what kind of a republic), he was a non-elected delegate. He argued that Australia was already a "de facto republic" and that any further change should be made only if the case was very powerful. With his ally, [[George Mye]] from the [[Torres Strait Islands]], he was the leading critic of the adopted proposal that any citizen whose name was on the general electoral roll, even a migrant of only two years' standing, should automatically be eligible to be president of the proposed republic of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Constitutional Convention, Canberra, 1998, vol. 3, pp. 221–3)&lt;/ref&gt; After the decisive failure in 1999 of the referendum to make Australia a republic, Blainey and the constitutional lawyer, Professor Colin Howard, were singled out by the Australian republicans' leader, [[Malcolm Turnbull]], as deserving a special share of the blame. He alleged that the pair had unduly shaped the official information posted to all electors. In their defence, it was contended that their influence was fair, for they operated in an official committee chaired by the neutral Sir [[Ninian Stephen]], lawyer and former governor general.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Turnbull, Fighting for the Republic, Hardie Grant, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Blainey served on the National Council for the Centenary of Federation from 1997 to 2002 (chairman from May 2001, succeeding Archbishop [[Peter Hollingworth]]), and chairman of the Council of the [[Centenary Medal]] from 2001–03. Later appointments included membership of the History Summit in Canberra in 2006 and the federal committee set up in 2007 to recommend a national curriculum for teaching Australian history.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} 
 
He sat, from 1997 to 2004, on the Council of the [[Royal Humane Society of Australasia]] which recommended awards for acts of civilian bravery. 
 
In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, he was a weekly or fortnightly columnist for ''[[The Australian]]'', the ''[[Melbourne Herald]]'', or the ''[[Melbourne Age]]''; he also wrote often for the ''[[Sydney Bulletin]]'', the ''[[Australian Business Monthly]]'' and other national journals. Booklets listing these articles and other works have been published by the library of [[Monash University]]. The latest booklet was last updated in about 2001. As a book reviewer, he has written for many Australian, UK and US publications. His ten-part series on Australian history, "The Blainey View", appeared on ABC television in 1982–83, the ABC's most ambitious venture so far on Australian history. [[Graham Kennedy]], the television star, narrated the continuity script.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Blundell, King: The Life and Comedy of Graham Kennedy, Pan Macmillan, 2003, pp. 124, 356–70&lt;/ref&gt;

Blainey is well known for speeches, often without notes, on historical and contemporary topics. In most anthologies of notable Australian speeches, present and past, one of his addresses is reprinted.&lt;ref&gt;"Great Australian Speeches", edited by Pamela Robson, Murdoch Books, 2009, pp. 180–90&lt;/ref&gt; On television and stage in later years, [[Max Gillies]] the comedian cleverly mimicked some speeches.

He currently serves on the boards of philanthropic bodies, including the [[Ian Potter Foundation]] since 1991 and the [[Deafness Foundation Trust]] since 1993, and is patron of others.

Blainey has, at times, been a controversial figure too. In the 1980s, he queried the level of Asian immigration to Australia and the policy of [[multiculturalism]] in speeches, articles and a book ''[[All for Australia]]''. He was said by leftist critics to be closely aligned{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} with the former [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|National]] Coalition government of [[John Howard]] in Australia, with Howard shadowing Blainey's conservative views on some issues, especially the view that Australian history has been hijacked by social liberals. As a result of these stances, Blainey is sometimes associated with right-wing politics.&lt;ref name="titleAustralian Parliamentary Library - Research Paper 5 1997-98"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9798/98RP05 |title=Different Perspectives on Black Armband History |work= Research Papers 1997–98 |publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library |accessdate=19 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404113845/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RP/1997-98/98rp05.htm |archivedate=4 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blainey himself is a member of no political party.

==Views on Asian immigration==
On 17 March 1984, Blainey addressed a major Rotary conference in the Victorian city of [[Warrnambool]]. He regretted that the [[Hawke Government|Hawke Labor Government]] in "a time of large unemployment" was bringing many new migrants to the areas of high unemployment, thus fostering tension. He blamed the government, not the migrants themselves. Criticising what he viewed as disproportionately high levels of Asian immigration, then running at 40 per cent of the annual intake, he added: "Rarely in the history of the modern world has a nation given such preference to a tiny ethnic minority of its population as the Australian Government has done in the past few years, making that minority the favoured majority in its immigration policy".&lt;ref&gt;The Age, and Warrnambool Standard, 19 March 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days later, in response to the prediction of the "increasing Asianisation" of Australia made by Labor's Immigration Minister [[Stewart West]], Blainey argued: "I do not accept the view, widely held in the Federal Cabinet, that some kind of slow Asian takeover of Australia is inevitable. I do not believe that we are powerless. I do believe that we can with good will and good sense control our destiny.... As a people, we seem to move from extreme to extreme. In the past 30 years the government of Australia has moved from the extreme of wanting a white Australia to the extreme of saying that we will have an Asian Australia and that the quicker we move towards it the better".&lt;ref&gt;Source: The Age, 20 March 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Blainey's speech, along with subsequent articles and a book on the subject, ignited nationwide controversy, especially in the Australian federal parliament which had not debated the principles of the immigration policy for many years. Most critics argued that Blainey's views were moderate and not racist. "All peoples of the world are worthy and deserve respect": that was the prime principle set out in the book, ''[[All for Australia]]'', which he wrote on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, Geoffrey. ''All for Australia'', Sydney, 1984, p.164&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in ''All for Australia'' he criticised the belief that "immigration policy should primarily reflect the truth that all 'races' are equal. On the contrary, an immigration policy should not, any more than a trade or tariff policy, be designed primarily to reflect that fact". According to Blainey, the Australian government's immigration policy was increasingly being influenced by multicultural ideology to the detriment of the national interest and the majority of Australians. He argued: "We are surrendering much of our own independence to a phantom opinion that floats vaguely in the air and rarely exists on this earth. We should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world". Blainey also warned that the "crimson thread of kinship" invoked by [[Sir Henry Parkes]] was being undermined, stating: "The cult of the immigrant, the emphasis on separateness for ethnic groups, the wooing of Asia and the shunning of Britain are part of this thread-cutting."

His views were to receive the support of a majority of Australian voters, both Labor and non-Labor voters, as a national Gallup poll confirmed in August.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Herald, 27 August 1984 citing an Australian Public Opinion Polls survey of 2182 voters&lt;/ref&gt; Victorians especially disapproved of the University's conduct in this matter.

In contrast, while Blainey was briefly in Europe in May, a professor and 23 other history teachers from the University of Melbourne distributed a public letter distancing themselves from what they called his "racialist" views.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to the Age of 19 May 1984 signed by 24 historians&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Hugh (2006). "Can Australia Survive the 21st Century?". The Wilfred Brookes Memorial Lecture. Deakin University&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians, including lecturers in Asian history, refused the request to sign the letter.

After a crowd of left-wing students and marchers, mostly from outside the University of Melbourne, broke into the heavily guarded building where Blainey was conducting a tutorial in historical research, he was advised by the university on security grounds that it must cancel all his future addresses within the University for the rest of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Sun News Pictorial&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ABC TV, 19 June 1984&lt;/ref&gt; In Brisbane on 5 July, when he gave a memorial address in honour of a deceased Queensland businessman in the [[Mayne Hall]] at the [[University of Queensland]] and chaired by the chancellor Sir James Foots, noisy protesters tried to dislocate the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Courier Mail 6 July 1984&lt;/ref&gt; These and similar protests were major items in the national television news. Blainey continued to express his views periodically on television, radio and his own newspaper columns but not in his own university. He retained his main position as Dean of the Faculty of Arts.

Blainey and his family were subject to threats of violence, prompting him at the police's request to remove his name and address from the public telephone book and organise security for his home. According to fellow historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]: "The immediate consequence of all this was that Blainey, easily Australia's best and most prolific living historian, was effectively silenced from speaking at his own university.... This violation of academic freedom, clearly the worst in Australian history, provoked no protest at all from the university's academic staff association, nor from the university council, let alone his own departmental colleagues."&lt;ref name="quadrant.org.au"&gt;Windschuttle, Keith.

On the so-called "Blainey affair", Australian prime minister [[John Howard]] would remark: "Nowhere, I suggest, have the fangs of the left so visibly been on display as they were in a campaign based on character assassination and intellectual dishonesty through their efforts to trash the name and reputation of that great Australian historian Geoffrey Blainey."&lt;ref name="quadrant.org.au"/&gt;

In December 1988, Blainey resigned from the University of Melbourne and resumed his former career as a freelance historian.&lt;ref&gt;Blainey's comments in interview with Frank Devine of Quadrant published in October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the Victorian government appointed him to the honorary position of foundation chancellor of the new University of Ballarat.

Subsequently, in December 2007, the University of Melbourne granted a Doctor of Laws to Blainey&lt;ref&gt;Press Release from University of Melbourne {{cite web | last = Smith | first = Katherine | year = 2007 | url = http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/articleid_4836.html | title = University of Melbourne honours Geoffrey Blainey's contribution to Australian history | publisher = University of Melbourne | accessdate = 14 December 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227220630/http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/articleid_4836.html | archive-date = 27 December 2007 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and declared that he was, in Australia, probably a unique professional historian, noting that he had fostered wide public interest in history. The citation observed that "few graduates of this University have exerted greater influence on national life".

==Blainey and the "History Wars" ==
Blainey has been an important contributor to the debate over Australian history, often referred to as the [[History Wars]].

In his 1993 ''Sir John Latham Memorial Lecture'', Blainey coined the phrases "[[History wars#Black armband debate|Black armband view of history]]" versus the contrasting "three cheers" view (see [[History wars]]). The phrase "Black armband view of history" began to be used, [[pejorative]]ly or otherwise, by some Australian commentators and intellectuals about historians and journalists, judges and clergymen, whom they viewed as having presented an unfairly critical portrayal of [[history of Australia|Australian history]] since European settlement.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Blainey coined the term the "Black armband view of history" to refer to those historians and academics, usually leftist, who denigrated Australia's past to an unusual degree and even accused European Australians of genocide against Aborigines. Former Liberal Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] described the Australian history wars as a branch of the "[[culture wars]]" and attributed Blainey with having initiated the wider wars in his immigration speeches of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Fraser and Margaret Symons, Fraser: the Political Memoirs, Melbourne University Publishing, 2011, see index and pp. 616–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the [[Australian Bicentenary]] in 1988, Blainey accused some academics and journalists of depicting Australian history since British settlement as essentially a "story of violence, exploitation, repression, racism, sexism, capitalism, colonialism, and a few other 'isms'." Blainey also accused multiculturalists of having "little respect for the history of Australia between 1788 and 1950," claiming that in their eyes "Australia was a desert between 1788 and 1950 because it was populated largely by people from the British Isles and because it seemed to have a cultural unity, a homogeneity which is the very antithesis of multiculturalism."&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, Geoffrey. ''Eye on Australia : Speeches and Essays of Geoffrey Blainey'', Schwartz Books, Melbourne, Vic., 1991, 272 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blainey referred to the contrasting positive histories as the "three cheers" school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Michael | last= Gordon | url= http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/05/1062549019737.html?from=storyrhs | title= Going down in history | work= | publisher= The Age | date= 6 September 2003 | accessdate= 11 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|To some extent my generation was reared on the Three Cheers view of history. This patriotic view of our past had a long run. It saw Australian history as largely a success. While the convict era was a source of shame or unease, nearly everything that came after was believed to be pretty good. There is a rival view, which I call the Black Armband view of history. In recent years it has assailed the optimistic view of history. The black armbands were quietly worn in official circles in 1988. The multicultural folk busily preached their message that until they arrived much of Australian history was a disgrace. The past treatment of Aborigines, of Chinese, of Kanakas, of non-British migrants, of women, the very old, the very young, and the poor was singled out, sometimes legitimately, sometimes not.... The Black Armband view of history might well represent the swing of the pendulum from a position that had been too favourable, too self congratulatory, to an opposite extreme that is even more unreal and decidedly jaundiced.|Geoffrey Blainey, ''In Our Time'', Melbourne, 1999}}

Critics of Blainey's article claimed that it was anti-Aboriginal. Yet, Blainey applauded the "many distinctive merits" of the traditional Aboriginal way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, In our Time, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Blainey's earlier book ''Triumph of the Nomads'',&lt;ref&gt;Triumph of the Nomads, Macmillan, Melbourne, 1975, and Outlook Press, NY, 1976 and subsequent Sun Books editions&lt;/ref&gt; was highly sympathetic to Aboriginal people, as the title indicates. It is still said to be the only narrative history of Aboriginal Australia before 1788, and a pioneering work. It was listed by the National Book Council in 1984 as one of the ten most significant Australian books of the previous 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report of National Book Council, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the launch of his 2015 book ''The Story of Australia's People Volume 1: The Rise and Fall of Ancient Australia'', Blainey predicted the History Wars would continue in the public arena for some time as "it is in the nature of history and of most intellectual activities, and the more so in a nation where the main strands of history — Aboriginal and European — are utterly different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Geoffrey | last= Blainey | url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/geoffrey-blainey-i-can-see-parts-of-our-history-with-fresh-eyes/story-e6frg8h6-1227222554300 | title= Geoffrey Blainey: "I can see parts of our history with fresh eyes" | work= | publisher= The Australian | date= 21 February 2015 | accessdate= 13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Geoffrey Blainey was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Historical Society of Victoria]] in 1967. In 1975 he was made an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] for his contribution to Australian literature. He was awarded a [[Companion of the Order of Australia]] in the [[Australia Day]] Honours list of 2000 for his service to academia, research and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1129635&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true It's an Honour] – Companion of the Order of Australia&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he was awarded a [[Centenary Medal]] for his services to the Centenary of Federation, of which he was Council chairman in 2001 and previously a member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1124723&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true It's an Honour] – Centenary Medal&lt;/ref&gt;

At the United Nations in New York in 1988, he was one of five intellectuals, including the American economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and the Mexican poet [[Octavio Paz]], who were awarded gold medals for "excellence in the dissemination of knowledge for the benefit of mankind". Blainey's book ''The Causes of War'', much read in military academies and American universities, was said to be one reason for the award.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]],"Book of the Year, 1988", Chicago, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

He is an emeritus professor of the [[University of Melbourne]], and a fellow of the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]] and of the [[Academy of Social Sciences in Australia]].

In 2002 the degree of Doctor of Letters was conferred on Professor Blainey in recognition of his contribution to the [[University of Ballarat]] and the community in general.&lt;ref&gt;http://federation.edu.au/about-feduni/our-university/history/art-and-historical-collection/honour-roll/b/professor-emeritus-geoffrey-blainey-1930-, accessed 23 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Blainey was Victorian State finalist for [[Senior Australian of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/honour-roll/?view=fullView&amp;recipientID=198&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Practical Shooting Confederation''' ('''IPSC''') is the world's second largest [[shooting sport]] association and the largest and oldest within [[practical shooting]]. Founded in 1976, the IPSC nowadays affiliates over 100 regions from [[Africa]], [[Americas]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name ="regions"&gt;[https://www.ipsc.org/ipsc/regions.php IPSC.org :: Regions]&lt;/ref&gt; Competitions are held with [[pistol]], [[revolver]], [[rifle]] and [[shotgun]], and competitors are divided into different divisions based on firearm and equipment features. While everyone in a division competes in the Overall category, there are also own separate awards for the categories Lady (female competitors), Junior (under 18 years), Senior (over 50 years) and Super Senior (over 60 years).

IPSC's activities include international regulation of the sport by approving firearms and equipment for various divisions, administering competition rules and education of range officials ([[referee]]s) through the [[International Range Officers Association]] who are responsible for conducting matches safely, fair and according to the rules. IPSC organizes the World Championships called the [[IPSC Handgun World Shoots|Handgun World Shoot]], [[IPSC Rifle World Shoots|Rifle World Shoot]] and [[IPSC Shotgun World Shoots|Shotgun World Shoot]] with three year intervals for each discipline.

== History ==
[[File:Combat masters A1.jpg|right|thumb|Five of the most famous shooters from the beginning of [[practical shooting]] in [[California]] during the late Fifties. Left to right: [[Ray Chapman (marksman)|Ray Chapman]], [[Elden Carl]], [[Thell Reed]], [[Jeff Cooper]] and [[Jack Weaver]]. (The sixth "Combat Master", [[John Plahn]], is missing from this photograph.)]]
The sport of practical shooting originated from competitions in [[California]] in the 1950s with the goal of developing handgun skills for defensive use, but quickly evolved into a pure sport with little grounding in the original purpose. The sport soon expanded to [[Europe]], [[Australia]], [[South America]] and [[Africa]]. IPSC was founded in May 1976 when practical shooting enthusiasts from around the world participated at a conference held in [[Columbia, Missouri]], creating a constitution and establishing the rules governing the sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspsa.org/document_library/IPSC%201976%20Columbia%20Conference%20Minutes.pdf Columbia Conference Minutes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ipsc.org/whatipsc.htm What Is IPSC] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021019025941/http://www.ipsc.org/whatipsc.htm |date=2002-10-19 }}", accessed August 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Cooper]] served as the first IPSC President. Today there are over 100 active IPSC regions,&lt;ref name ="regions"/&gt; making practical shooting a major international sport which emphasizes [[Gun safety|firearms safety]] highly. Through international rules concerning firearms, equipment and organizing of matches one tries to unite the three elements precision, power and speed, which is also the motto of IPSC that is "Diligentia, Vis, Celeritas" (DVC), Latin for "precision, power, speed". Only full caliber firearms are used, i.e. for handguns [[9x19 mm]] is the smallest caliber, and the competitors try to achieve most points in the shortest time possible.

== Scoring system ==
[[File:Stage brief at the 2017 IPSC Rifle World Shoot.jpg|thumb|right|A squad of shooters get their stage brief by an [[International Range Officers Association|IROA]] Range Officer on stage 11 of the [[2017 IPSC Rifle World Shoot]] in Russia.]]
Accuracy and speed is reflected by the comstock scoring method, while power is reflected by the minimum [[Power factor (shooting sports)|power factor]] requirement. Competitors fire the stages one at a time, and the scoring system is based on achieving most possible points in the shortest time.

=== Comstock ===
The scoring method is called comstock, named after its inventor Walt Comstock, which means that the competitor has unlimited time to complete the stage and can fire an unlimited number of rounds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://americanhandgunner.com/retro-remembering-competition/ Retro-Remembering: Competition | American Handgunner]&lt;/ref&gt; The time is measured from the start signal until the last shot fired using special [[shot timer]]s with microphones, and this way the competitor can influence the total stage time. Since the number of rounds is unlimited, the competitor can re-engage the same target in order to get more points, but at the cost of using more time. Usually the two best scoring hits count for each target.

Competitors are ranked for each stage by their hit factor, which is the ratio of points per second. The hit factor is calculated by summing the points (target scores minus penalties) and dividing by the time used.

&lt;math&gt;hit\ factor={points \over seconds}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if a stage has 12 paper targets, requires two scoring hits per paper taget, and since an A-hit gives 5 points, the stage will have 12 × 2 × 5 = 120 points available. If a competitor scores 115 points and uses 25.00 seconds he will get a hit factor for that stage of {{frac|115 points|25.00 s}} = 4.6. The competitor with the highest hit factor wins the stage and gets all the available stage points (in this case 120 stage points), while other competitors are given stage points based on their hit factor percentage compared to the winner. For the overall match score, stage points are added for all stages, which means that each stage is weighted by how many stage points that are available.

The scoring method allows for a precise gradation of performances across the match, but requires a computer and software to do in a timely fashion. Matches can either be scored on paper and manually transferred to the official [http://www.ipsc.org/matches/winmss.php IPSC Match Scoring System (WinMSS)], or can be scored directly on electronic devices like [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]] with the WinMSS Electronic Score Sheet (ESS) app or third party scoring systems like [http://shootnscoreit.com Shoot'n Score It] or [https://practiscore.com/ PractiScore].

=== Power factor ===
[[File:Bullet coming from S&amp;W.jpg|thumb|right|A [[high-speed photography]] of a [[.38 Special]] bullet fired out of a [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 686]] revolver.]]
The [[power factor (shooting sports)|power factor]] is the [[momentum]] of the fired bullet as it's moving through the air, which contribute to the [[recoil]] of the firearm (together with the propellant gases stemming from the amount of gunpowder). Thus, the power factor in a way reflects recoil. The power factor must exceed certain thresholds, and is calculated by measuring the ''bullet speed'' using a [[Gun chronograph|chronograph]] and measuring another of the competitors bullets on a [[weighing scale]] to find the ''bullet mass'', thereafter calculating the ''power factor'' by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;{power \; factor} = {mass} \cdot {velocity}&lt;/math&gt;

The official unit used for the power factor is the [[Imperial units|imperial]] unit '''"kilo grain feet per second"''' (kgr·ft/s). "Grain feet per second" (gr·ft/s) can be obtained by measuring the ''mass'' in '''[[grain (mass)|grain]] (gr)''' (equal to {{frac|1|7000}} [[pound (mass)|pound]]), and ''velocity'' in '''[[foot per second|feet per second]] (ft/s)''', but since their product yields a very large number it is common to multiply by a factor of {{frac|1|1000}}, obtaining the power factor in "''kilo'' grain feet per second" instead.

:&lt;math&gt;kgr \cdot ft/s = \frac{grain \cdot ft/s}{1000}&lt;/math&gt;

To measure the [[muzzle velocity]] the competitor's ammunition must be fired in the competitor's firearm, since velocities can vary slightly from one firearm to another. In for instance handgun competitions the ammunition must exceed 125 kgr·ft/s for minor scoring, and at least 160 or 170 kgr·ft/s for major scoring (depending on division). Extra scoring is not given for exceeding the threshold. A competitor declaring major, but who fails the threshold, have their score re-calculated at minor. A competitor who fails the threshold of minor is given a score of zero for the match.

=== Targets ===

To achieve a varied, challenging and exciting sport there are no fixed target arrangements, distances or shooting programs, making every match unique. Paper and steel targets can be mixed in the same stage, and may be static, moving or partially covered by targets called no-shoots that give minus points if hit.

Paper targets have the three scoring zones A, C and D with points per hit varying slightly depending on power factor. A center hit for both minor or major is five points, but hits in lesser scoring areas are rewarded more for major than minor with the A-C-D zones being scored 5-4-2 for major and 5-3-1 for minor (see table below). A competitor who has declared minor must therefore either shoot more "A" hits or shoot faster than one who has declared major in order to make up the scoring disadvantage.

Some typical examples moving target setups are swingers, bobbers, clamshells, movers and drop turners.

Steel targets score 5 points and must fall to be scored. (For rifle some steel targets may score 10 points).

For paper targets, the octagonal IPSC Target in typical cardboard color is used throughout all the disciplines, and a 2/3 scaled down IPSC Mini Target is used to simulate a full size target placed at a greater distance. Additionally the Universal Target can be used for rifle or shotgun, while the A3 and A4 paper targets are approved for shotgun matches only.

For steel targets, there are two standardized knock down targets, the IPSC Popper (85&amp;nbsp;cm tall) and the 2/3 scaled down IPSC Mini Popper (56&amp;nbsp;cm tall). Metal plates are often circles between 20–30&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter or squares between 15x15 cm to 30x30 cm for handgun, and circles between 15–30&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter or squares between 15x15 cm to 30x45 cm for rifle and shotgun.

== Disciplines and divisions ==
For many years IPSC was fired with whatever firearm the competitors chose, but as equipment became more and more specialized various equipment classes was introduced. The equipment classes in IPSC are called "divisions". All divisions fire the same stages, on the same days, as all other divisions, in a match. However, when calculating match standings, only divisional stage scores are compared. Thus, the top competitor in Open on a stage is the measure for all other Open competitors, the best Standard competitor is the measure for all other Standard competitors and likewise for all other divisions.

=== Handgun ===

 }}
In handgun there are currently one division for optical sights and four divisions for iron sights. The minimum caliber is 9x19 mm for all handgun divisions. During competition the handgun must be worn in a [[handgun holster|holster]] securely attached to the competitor's [[Belt (clothing)|belt]]. The holster needs to cover the [[trigger guard]], the heel of the gun needs to be above the top of the belt and the belt has to be attached through at least three belt loops. Men must wear the holster, magazine holders etc. in the belt at waist level, while female competitors may choose to wear their equipment either at hip or waist level. During competition the position of the holster, magazine holders etc. can not be moved or adjusted from stage to stage. For all divisions except Open and Revolver the foremost portion of the handgun and all magazines must be placed behind the hip bone. Race holsters are permitted in all divisions

; Open:
Open division is the handgun equivalent to the [[Formula One|Formula 1]] race car{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} where most modifications are permitted to achieve a faster and more accurate gun. It's the only division which permits optical and electronic sights (such as [[red dot sight]]s) and recoil reducing [[muzzle brake]]s (also called compensators).&lt;ref name="HGdiv"&gt;[http://www.ipsc.org/rules/divlistP.php IPSC :: The Handgun Divisions List]&lt;/ref&gt; The division facilitates the highest magazine capacity, placing a restriction of 170&amp;nbsp;mm  maximum overall length measured at the rear of any magazine. Shorter magazines, i.e. 140&amp;nbsp;mm, are also popular because of easier handling and often more reliable feeding, leaving the competitor a choice of equipment according to the stage at hand.

Open and Revolver are the only two divisions where 9&amp;nbsp;mm [[bullet]]s (.355") can be used to achieve major scoring, and hence [[.38 Super]] (or some variant) or [[9×19mm Parabellum|9x19 mm]] loaded to major [[Power factor (shooting sports)|power factor]] of 160 kgr·ft/s are popular [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] for the pistols in Open. The 9&amp;nbsp;mm [[caliber]] cartridges provides higher gas pressures and better magazine capacity over [[10 mm caliber]]s. Open handguns are often expensive custom builds with parts and features specifically designed for competition, and with the maximum magazine length of 170&amp;nbsp;mm some 9&amp;nbsp;mm/ .38 Super magazines can hold up to 28 or 29 rounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infinityfirearms.com/1101.php?indx=15 Infinity Firearms - Magazines]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Open division was formally adopted at the General Assembly following the 1992 [[IPSC European Handgun Championship|European Handgun Championship]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], and became a recognized division starting in 1993.&lt;ref name = "CanadaNo2"&gt;[http://www.ipsc-canada.org/diligentia/Diligentia_1992_2.pdf Diligentia - Officiel Newsletter of IPSC Canada, No 2 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; Any handguns complying with the previous rules were included, for instance there was placed no restriction on handgun size or type of sights. Later {{When|date=August 2016}} the 170&amp;nbsp;mm maximum length was introduced.

; Standard:
Standard division allows any handgun that fits inside the IPSC box, and most modifications are permitted (except optical sights or compensators). Light match triggers are common, and modifications such as slide rackers, thumb rests ("gas pedals") and grip tape on the [[Pistol slide|slide]] can sometimes also be seen. The IPSC box has internal dimensions of 225 x 150 x 45&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;ref name="HGdiv"/&gt; in length × height × depth with a tolerance of +1&amp;nbsp;mm, -0&amp;nbsp;mm (approximately 8.86 x 5.91 x 1.77 inches). The handgun must fit with the slide parallel to the longest side of the box and [[Hammer (firearms)|hammer]] cocked if applicable. The handgun must fit the box with any of its magazines inserted, which means that for instance on 2011 pattern pistols either 124 or 126&amp;nbsp;mm magazines usually will give the maximum capacity and still fit the box.

Minimum caliber for minor scoring is 9x19 mm loaded to a power factor of 125 kgr·ft/s while minimum caliber for major scoring is a 10&amp;nbsp;mm (.40") cartridge loaded to a power factor of 170 kgr·ft/s, making for an interesting choice between minor and major scoring taken in mind the differences in recoil, magazine capacity and scoring points. An example of differences in magazine capacity depending on caliber can be seen when comparing stock 126&amp;nbsp;mm STI 2011 double stack magazines, which according to the manufacturer yields a capacity of either 12 rounds for [[.45 ACP]], 14 rounds for [[.40 S&amp;W]] or 17 rounds for [[9x19 mm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stiguns.com/mag-capacity/ Mag Capacity « STI Guns]&lt;/ref&gt; Magazine capacity can be further increased using aftermakert springs, followers and basepads as long as they still fit the box. For a 2011 pattern handgun, aftermarket parts and magazine tuning can increase capacity from 12 to 16 rounds for .45 ACP, from 14 to 19 rounds for .40 S&amp;W and from 17 to 21 rounds for 9x19 mm. It is common belief that major scoring using the .40 S&amp;W will give better scores for most competitors over the 9x19 mm, but at the cost of more expensive ammunition.

The Standard division was formally adopted at the General Assembly following the 1992 [[IPSC European Handgun Championship|European Handgun Championship]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], and became a recognized division starting in 1993.&lt;ref name="CanadaNo2"/&gt; One of the intentions of the Standard division was to create an own division for more "stock" firearms, since it up to then had been no equipment divisions, and the sport had started to become dominated by custom built race guns with compensators and optical sights. However, the Standard division was later criticized for also having become a "race division" somewhat like Open, dominated by custom built guns and specialized gear. Major caliber .40 S&amp;W dominates, since it is seen as a much better alternative scoring-wise, but is more expensive than regular minor scoring 9x19 mm (price difference varies, but usually 50-60% more expensive{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}). Also, from a practical standpoint, the .40 S&amp;W can be difficult to obtain when travelling to international matches, while the 9x19 mm round on the contrary is perceived as affordable and available all around the world. This made way for the Production division starting in 2000, which has minor scoring only, allows fewer modifications and has a common magazine limit of 15 rounds.

; Production:

Production division is the most popular division as of 2016. The division allows very few modifications and is limited to typical "off the shelf" [[service pistol]]s which has to be explicitly approved and listed on the [http://www.ipsc.org/rules/proddiv.php IPSC Production Division List]. Maximum barrel length is 127&amp;nbsp;mm (5 inches). The handgun must be double-action ([[Trigger (firearms)#Traditional double-action|DA/ SA]], [[Trigger (firearms)#Double-action only|DAO]] or [[Trigger (firearms)#Pre-set .28striker or hammer.29|striker]] fired), and is required to have a minimum trigger pull weight. Striker fired handguns have a minimum trigger pull of 1.36&amp;nbsp;kg for every trigger pull, while DA/SA handguns are required to have a minimum trigger pull of 2.27&amp;nbsp;kg only for the first double action trigger pull (no weight limit for subsequent single action trigger pulls).

Production is the only division with minor scoring only, which means that anyone can be competitive with affordable and readily available 9x19 mm factory ammunition, without having to worry about [[handloading]] to make major. Together with (in general) affordable handguns, Production therefore makes for a popular division. Different models of handguns have variance in magazine capacity, but this is evened out by limiting competitors to load their magazines to a maximum of 15 rounds (15 in each magazine plus 1 in the chamber).

Permitted modifications are limited to the application of grip tape in limited areas around the grip, replacement of sights that do not require gunsmithing to be installed (i.e. [[Milling (machining)|milling]] to the slide) and the replacement of internal components only available as a factory option from the original manufacturer. After-market magazines are allowed. Minor polishing and fitting of trigger components is permitted. Note that there are differences in approved handguns for IPSC Production division and USPSA Production division, as well as permitted modifications.

From 2019 the Production division has been divided into '''Production''', '''Production Optics''' and '''Production Optics Lite'''. Production Optics is based on the Production rules, but with an optical sight allowed.The optical sight can only be mounted to the un-modified slide. Racking handles or other protuberances from the optical sight or its mounting is not permitted. Regular Production handguns without optical sights can also compete in this division. Production Optics Lite is similar, except that the complete handgun must satisfy a weight limit of 1000 grams

The Production division was introduced at the General Assembly after the [[1999 IPSC Handgun World Shoot|1999 Handgun World Shoot]] in Cebu, Philippines,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsc.org/pdf/genasm23.pdf Twenty-Third IPSC General Assembly Cebu, Philippines, October 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; and became a recognized division starting in 2000. Production Optics was accepted as a trial division in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsc.org/pdf/genasm41.pdf Forty-First  IPSC General Assembly Chateauroux, France, August, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and both Production Optics and Production Optics Lite were definitively accepted in 2018.

; Classic:
Introduced in 2011, the Classic division was modelled after the USPSA Single Stack division and is limited to handguns visually resembling the single stack [[M1911 pistol|1911]] form. The handgun with any of its magazines inserted has to fit inside the IPSC box. The competitor can choose between maximum 8 rounds per magazine for major scoring or 10 rounds per magazine for minor scoring. Minor scoring can be achieved with a 9&amp;nbsp;mm projectile loaded to a power factor of 125 kgr·ft/s, while major scoring requires a 10&amp;nbsp;mm or larger projectile loaded to a power factor of 170 kgr·ft/s.&lt;ref name="HGdiv"/&gt;

Handguns must have a one piece metal frame, slide with stirrup cuts and the [[Dust cover (firearms)|dust cover]] (with or without an [[Picatinny rail|accessory rail]]) can have a maximum length of 75&amp;nbsp;mm from the leading edge to the rear of the [[slide stop]] pin. Magazine wells cannot exceed a maximum outside width of 35&amp;nbsp;mm. Permitted modifications are shaped slides (i.e. flat-top or tri-top), shaped trigger guards (i.e. squared or undercut), bob-tail backstraps, bull or coned barrels, external extractors, finger-grooves (machined, add-on, wrap-around etc.), custom magazine release buttons, triggers, hammers, single/ ambidextrous thumb safeties, any iron sights, extended slide lock levers and thumb shields provided they do not act as a thumb rest. Cosmetic modifications are permitted.

Prohibited modifications / parts are slide lightening cuts, weak hand thumb rests and slide rackers.

; Revolver:
In the Revolver division double action revolvers in caliber 9x19 mm or larger of any capacity can be used. Muzzle brakes or optical sights are not permitted. Competitors may declare major with a 9&amp;nbsp;mm (.355") bullet loaded to a power factor of 170,&lt;ref name="HGdiv"/&gt; but a maximum of 6 rounds can be fired before a reload is required. From 2017, there is no limit on rounds fired number of rounds fired before a reload is required, but revolvers with a capacity of 7 rounds or more will automatically be scored as Minor power factor. It is common to use [[moon clip]]s for faster reloads. The Revolver division was introduced at the General Assembly after the [[1999 IPSC Handgun World Shoot|1999 Handgun World Shoot]] in [[Cebu]], [[Philippines]], and was a recognized division starting in 2000, initially under the name "Revolver Standard" before it was renamed to "Revolver" around 2009.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

; Modified:
Now obsolete, the Modified division was a mix between Open and Standard. Handguns were allowed to have compensators and optical sights as long as they would fit in the IPSC box with any of its magazine inserted. The Modified division was formally adopted at the General Assembly following the 1992 [[IPSC European Handgun Championship|European Handgun Championship]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], and became a recognized division starting in 1993.&lt;ref name="CanadaNo2"/&gt; The division saw some use in southern Europe, but was otherwise not very widespread, and was retired after the 2011 World Shoot XVI in [[Rhodes]], [[Greece]]. Competitors with Modified handguns would then afterwards compete in Open.

=== Rifle ===
Important elements in rifle include the use of [[Prone position|prone]], off hand and supported shooting positions. Starting position is usually with the butt of the rifle touching the hip. Knowledge of the firearms [[External ballistics|ballistics]] is a key element to succeed at the [[Long range shooting|long range]] targets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jprifles.com/bulletin/propost_july_2017_01_01.html JP Enterprises BULLETin - Know Your Basic Ballistics]&lt;/ref&gt; The recommended balance of target distances is that 30 percent of the targets are placed closer than 60 meters, 50 percent of the targets between 60 and 150 meters and 20 percent of the targets between 150 and 300 meters. Most competitors zero their sights at 200 meters. Being an outdoor sport, the weather can have a profound effect on competitor scores due to wind or different lighting conditions, especially on long range targets. Therefore, top ranked competitors are often squadded together in order to achieve the most similar conditions.

There is no minimum caliber, but the ammunition has to make a power factor of 150 kgr·ft/s for minor or 320 kgr·ft/s for major scoring (formerly 160 and 340 kgr·ft/s respectively).&lt;ref&gt;IPSC Rifle Rules 3rd Edition - October, 1996, 7.25 Power Ratings: Major 340, Minor 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2002 IPSC Rifle Rules, Appendix J: Major 320, Minor 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Since two hits per target is normally required, rifles with minor power factor calibers dominate on the shorter ranges in most of the divisions due to less recoil and shorter recoil impulse. Minor ammunition being most common means that anyone can be competitive with affordable and readily available .223 Remington factory ammunition, without having to worry about handloading to make major. Ammunition loaded to major power factor has more recoil and a longer recoil impulse, but have the advantage of better ballistics at [[Long range shooting|long range]] targets. Major scoring may be more competitive in the manual divisions since normally only one hit is required per target, lessening the importance of a small recoil impulse.

In the beginning competitions were fired with whatever rifle the competitors chose, and while the type of rifles mostly have remained the same sighting systems have changed a lot. For a while rifles equipped with optics and iron sights competed side by side, but were divided somewhere around the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} into an Open division for optic sights and a Standard division for iron sights. Open and Standard were the only two rifle divisions until the 2004 season when similar divisions were introduced for manually operated mechanisms. The Open and Standard division was then renamed to Semi Auto Open and Semi Auto Standard, while the new manual divisions was named Manual Action Open and Manual Action Standard. Around 2011 a provisional division named "Manual Action Standard 10" was approved for evaluation as a testing ground for development of the Manual divisions.

[[semi-automatic rifle|Self-loading rifles]] are used in the Semi Auto Open and Semi Auto Standard division, while the manual divisions are limited to manual [[Action (firearms)|action type]]s.

;Semi Auto Open (Open):
Semi Auto Open, usually simply referred to as the "Open divison", is the most popular rifle division. Optical sights are allowed together with bipods and muzzle brakes.&lt;ref name="Rdiv"&gt;[http://www.ipsc.org/rules/divlistR.php IPSC :: The Rifle Divisions List]&lt;/ref&gt; Bipods can be taken on and off during a stage, and on some stages it can even be advantageous to switch between different bipod sizes. Many top competitors use rifles with 46&amp;nbsp;cm (18") barrels in order to run the longer rifle length gas system and achieve a softer recoil impulse. An adjustable gas system is popular. Some also use low mass bolt carriers and buffer weights, which may however cause reliability issues if not tuned correctly.

Low power [[Telescopic sight|scope sights]] with a variable magnification starting at 1x are popular, with day time bright illuminated 1-6x or 1-8x scopes being the most popular. Usually only the center of the reticle is illuminated. Some [[reticle]]s have [[milliradian]] based wind holds or holdover marks to compensate for wind and bullet drop on long range targets, while others prefer reticles with a simple dot and crosshair and choose to dial long range adjustments on the turrets instead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/03/07/champions-opinion-swarovski-z8i-ld-brt-reticles/ A champion's opinion on the Swarovski Z8i LD-I and BRT-I reticles -The Firearm Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; Turrets are often exposed and lockable, having ballistic drop compensation (BDC) and a zero stop, while some competitors choose to use capped turrets for the wind adjustment. Important optical characteristics&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.burrisoptics.com/blog/scopes/what-to-look-for-in-an-lpvo What to look for in a Low Power Variable Optic | Burris Optics]&lt;/ref&gt; are true 1x or 1.1x low end magnification, while on higher magnification it is important with a large field of view and a large exit pupil. Some other important scope qualities are weight and [[stray light]] performance.

To avoid having to adjust magnification up and down when transitioning between several long and short range targets during the same stage, some combine a scope with a 45 degree side mounted red dot optic, but the effectiveness of this is debated and there are both top competitors who use it and not. For instance [[Raine Peltokoski]] uses only one optical sight, and in such situations instead uses a technique called "Occluded Eye Aiming" where one blocks the objective (i.e. with a lens cover or by hand) so that one only sees the illuminated dot with one eye and the target with the other eye.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luckygunner.com/lounge/occluded-eye-aiming/ Lucky Gunner Lounge - Occluded Eye Aiming - Using Your Scope Like a Red Dot]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rifles with non-magnified [[red dot sight]]s as the primary optic also compete in Open and are very competitive at short ranges, but the lack of magnification is a big disadvantage at longer ranges.

;Semi Auto Standard (Standard):
[[File:Target coverage by front sight width.png|thumb|right|Table of different front sight post sizes in [[milliradian|mil]] and at what distances the full width of a target would be covered. A sight post that appears wider than the target can make precise aiming difficult, but this can be solved by adjusting the sights up and aiming below the target.]]
The Semi Auto Standard division usually simply referred to as the "Standard division", tests the added skill of using iron sights only. Also, bipods are not allowed and muzzle brakes have to be within the maximum dimensions of 30x90 mm (approx. 1x3.5 inches).&lt;ref name="Rdiv"/&gt; A long sight radius is desirable as it helps even target and sight focus due to larger [[depth of field]], and thus iron sighted rifles often have longer [[Gun barrel|barrel]]s with the front sight attached to the end of it. Many Standard top competitors use the longer 50&amp;nbsp;cm (20") barrel over the 46&amp;nbsp;cm (18") to achieve longer sight radius. Any [[iron sights]] can be used, and both "[[Globe sight|globe]]" and "post" front sights are popular, as well as [[Aperture sight|aperture]], ghost ring or [[diopter sight|diopter]] rear sights.

;Manual Action Open (Manual Open):
The manual divisions test the added skill of using a manual action, meaning that the rifles must be operated by physical manipulation, with some examples being [[bolt action|bolt]], [[pump action|pump]] or [[Straight-pull rifles|straight pull]] actions. Manual Action Open, usually simply referred to as the "Manual Open division", allows optical sights, muzzle brakes and bipods.&lt;ref name="Rdiv"/&gt; Turn bolt actions require the competitor to perform both rotational and linear motions during the loading cycle, while pump and straight pull actions can be cycled back and forward without rotation of the bolt handle by the competitor. This reduces the number of movements from four to two, but comes at the cost of often having either poor or no primary extraction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forgottenweapons.com/swiss-straight-pull-first-impressions/ Swiss Straight-Pull First Impressions – Forgotten Weapons]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2017/05/11/break-case-visceral-illustration-primary-extraction-bloke-range/ Break That Case: A Visceral Illustration of Primary Extraction, with Bloke on the Range - The Firearm BlogThe Firearm Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; increasing the risk of malfunctions.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} A turn bolt action on the other hand has a mechanical advantage used during chambering and primary extraction, which makes for more reliable feeding and extraction. Both types of mechanisms have won championships. Bolt action rifles usually also have a much shorter [[lock time]] than hammer fired pump and straight pull actions, which can play a significant role in accuracy on long range targets.

;Manual Action Standard (Manual Standard):
Manual Action Standard, usually simply referred to as the "Manual Standard division",  is limited to iron sights only, and no muzzle brakes or bipods are allowed.&lt;ref name="Rdiv"/&gt; Manual Action Standard 10 (MAS10) (between 2012 and 2017) was a trial division that allowed iron sights only, a magazine capacity of 11 rounds (10 in the magazine plus 1 in the chamber) and factory fitted muzzle brakes only.&lt;ref name="Rdiv"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Shotgun ===
[[File:Daniel Horner at a match in South Carolina 2017.jpg|thumb|right|[[Daniel Horner]] firing his shotgun at a flying clay target during a match in [[South Carolina]], [[United States|USA]] in 2017.]]
Starting position is usually with the shotgun in one hand and the butt of the shotgun touching the hip. There is only one power factor of 480 kgr·ft/s, and all targets are scored as major which means that anyone can be competitive with affordable and readily available [[Gauge (bore diameter)|12 gauge]] 70&amp;nbsp;mm (2-3/4") ammunition. Different options on [[Choke (firearms)|shotgun chokes]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.practical-shotgun.com/chokes Chokes for Practical Shotgun - Practical-Shotgun.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shotgun shell|ammunition]] (from different [[Shot (pellet)|pellet]] sizes and up to [[Shotgun slug|slugs]]) makes for interesting choke and ammunition choices based on the stage at hand where the competitor has to consider the spread of the choke relative to the distance. All divisions have limits of the number of shells loaded at the beginning of the stage, but the limits are removed after the start signal. For instance some may choose to run 10 or 11 round tubes in the Standard division which is limited to 9 rounds in the tube at the start signal.

;Open:
The Open division allows optical sights, muzzle brakes, and is the only division which permits detachable magazines or the use of speed loaders for tube magazines. The maximum overall length of the shotgun is 1320&amp;nbsp;mm (approximately 52 in) measured parallel to the barrel.&lt;ref name="SGdiv"&gt;[http://www.ipsc.org/rules/divlistS.php IPSC :: The Shotgun Divisions List]&lt;/ref&gt; Detachable magazines must not contain more than 10 rounds at the start signal, while shotguns with fixed magazines may have an initial load of 14 rounds. After the start signal detachable magazines can be loaded up 12 rounds, while there is no limit for tube magazines.

;Modified:
The Modified division allows muzzle brakes and optical sights, but is limited to internal tube magazines. The maximum overall length of the shotgun is 1320&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="SGdiv"/&gt; Modifications of the floor plate to facilitate loading is permitted, given that the  modification doesn't exceed 75&amp;nbsp;mm in length or protrudes more than 32&amp;nbsp;mm from the shotgun frame in any direction. Maximum 14 rounds can be loaded at the start signal (13+1, 13 in the tube plus 1 in the chamber), but more can be loaded after the start signal. Until 2017 the division was limited to iron sights, but from 2018 optical sights are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.practical-shotgun.com/proposed-shotgun-rule-changes-2017 Shotgun rule changes passed by vote at 2017 IPSC General Assembly - Practical-Shotgun.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipsc.org/pdf/RulesShotgun.pdf IPSC Shotgun Competition Rules - Jan 2018 Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Standard:
The standard division is the most popular division as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rem870.com/2016/11/26/practical-shotgun-shooting-for-beginners-part-1-divisions-ready-conditions-basic-upgrades/ Practical Shotgun Shooting (IPSC) for Beginners, Part 1 (Divisions, Ready Conditions, Basic Upgrades)]&lt;/ref&gt; The division is limited to iron sights and internal tube magazines, and muzzle brakes are not allowed. The shotgun model has to be factory produced of at least 500 units.&lt;ref name="SGdiv"/&gt; Maximum 9 rounds can be loaded at the start signal (8+1, 8 in the tube plus 1 in the chamber), but more can be loaded after the start signal.

;Standard Manual (Manual):
The Standard Manual division, usually simply referred to as the "Manual divison", is the only shotgun division limited to manual actions. Limited to iron sights, internal tube magazines and no muzzle brakes, the shotgun model has to be factory produced of at least 500 units.&lt;ref name="SGdiv"/&gt; Maximum 9 rounds can be loaded at the start signal (8+1, 8 in the tube plus 1 in the chamber), but more can be loaded after the start signal.

=== Other ===
* Tournaments are [[multi gun|2 or 3-Gun]] matches which can include any combination of the three disciplines handgun, rifle and shotgun in the same match. There are default Grand Tournament divisions, but match organizers may also declare their own specific Grand Tournament divisions. In addition to the main disciplines (handgun, rifle and shotgun) there are also some supplemental disciplines:
* Mini-Rifle is for small caliber rifles ([[.22 Long Rifle|.22 LR]] only) with minor power factor scoring only, and competitions are mostly held indoor in the winter as training in the off-season.
* Pistol Caliber Carbine (PCC) is for pistol caliber rifles only ([[9×19mm Parabellum|9×19 mm]], [[.40 S&amp;W]], [[.45 ACP]], etc,) with minor power factor scoring only. The Carbine division can be held up to level 3, and either as a standalone match or as a separate division in a regular Handgun, Rifle or Mini Rifle matches.
* [[IPSC Action Air|Action Air]] is for airsoft handguns, and enjoys popularity in countries where civilian ownership of firearms are restricted. Minor power factor scoring only. Action Air is also used in the off-season in other countries as an affordable and easily available training tool because there is no need for a [[shooting range]] (competitions can for instance be held at an ordinary [[gym]])

== Safety ==
{{multiple image
 | width = 150
 | footer = [[Eye protection|Eye]] and [[ear protection]] is mandatory for both competitors and spectators.

 | image2 = DIN 4844-2 D-M003.svg
 }}
The safety of all competitors, officials and spectators are always of the highest importance in competitions. Eye and ear protection is mandatory for both competitors and spectators. Firearms are kept unloaded until on the firing line under the direct supervision of a Range Officer, and can otherwise only be handled in designated [[safety area]]s. The safety area contain a direction with a secure backstop where competitors can handle unloaded firearms for example for packing or unpacking, holstering, cleaning or repair, dry firing or training with empty magazines. Handling of ammunition is expressively prohibited within the safety areas, including any dummy rounds. Outside the safety area ammunition can be handled freely to load magazines, but firearms may only be handled under the direct supervision of a Range Officer. The strict separation of firearms and ammunition prevents accidents like [[accidental discharge]] (AD). Violations result in disqualification from the competition.

== Matches ==
=== Types of courses ===
[[File:Shooting area for an IPSC stage at the 2017 IPSC Rifle World Shoot.jpg|thumb|right|Walls and Fault Lines on the ground are used to define the boundary of the shooting area used during the Course of Fire.]]

A match consists of a mix between short courses (lowest number of targets), medium and long courses (highest number of targets). The approved balance for a match is a ratio of 3 short courses to 2 medium courses and 1 long course (i.e. 6 short, 4 medium and 2 long courses for a level 3 match). Since the number of targets dictate the available points for that stage, and therefore Long courses potentially can have a have great impact on the overall standings. Short courses have fewer points available, and tend not to be as critical for the overall standings. Short courses are often more technical, offer many different stage solutions, or include challenging elements such as "empty chamber" or "empty magazine well" starts, or "non-freestyle shooting" elements such as strong or weak hand only. Medium courses are something in between, while long courses will have the highest round count. Long courses tend to be more freestyle and straightforward as far as different stage solutions. The shooting challenges may still not necessarily be easy, and a match can be lost or won at a long course since there are so many points available.

=== Match levels ===
[[File:Opening Ceremony 2017 IPSC Rifle World Shoot.jpg|thumb|right|The opening ceremony at the [[2017 IPSC Rifle World Shoot]] in [[Russia]].]]
Competitions are held at all levels from club matches and up to the world championships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsc.org/matches/ratings.php IPSC :: IPSC Match Ratings]&lt;/ref&gt; Level 3 matches and up require official IPSC pre-approved match level sanctioning in regards to courses, IROA-range official etc.

* Level 1: Club matches
* Level 2: Matches open to participants from different clubs
* Level 3: Regional matches, i.e. [[national championship]]s or  other large matches such as the [[Extreme Euro Open]]
* Level 4: Continental championships, i.e. the European or Pan-American Championship
* Level 5: The [[IPSC World Shoots (disambiguation)|World Shoots]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;

The World Shoots are the highest level shooting matches within IPSC. Held since 1975,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsc.org/results/hoc.php IPSC :: History of Champions]&lt;/ref&gt; it is a multi-day match where the best IPSC shooters from around the world compete for the World Champion title.

=== Match officials ===
The [[International Range Officers Association]] (IROA) is a part of IPSC with the responsibility to train and certify their own dedicated range officials, who are responsible for conducting matches [[firearm safety|safely]], fair and according to the rules. In addition, each IPSC region have their own National Range Officers Institute (NROI) under the IROA. In a match range officials from IROA and NROI can work alongside in the ranks:

* '''Range Officer (RO)''' - The Range Officer gives the competitors stage briefings, issue range commands and follows the competitor through the conduction of the stage to monitor time, scores and safe firearms handling.
* '''Chief Range Officer (CRO)''' - In case there are several Range Officers, a Chief Range Officer will be assigned to have the primary authority over the particular course. Like the RO, the CRO will oversee fair and consistent application of the rules.
* '''Range Master (RM)''' - The Range Master has the overall authority over the entire range during the match, including all Match Officials and the overall safety.
* '''Match Director (MD)''' handles the overall match administration before and during the match, including registration, squadding, scheduling, range construction and coordination of the staff. The Match Director doesn't have to be an NROI or IROA Official. 
* '''Stats Officer (SO)''' is another important role with the responsibility to collect, sort and verify the final results.

The official '''ICS''' classification system ('''I'''PSC '''C'''lassification '''S'''ystem) allows athletes to be ranked both nationally and internationally based on previous results. Competitors are ranked from top to bottom as either Grand Master, Master, A, B, C or D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsc.org/classification/ IPSC.org :: Classifications]&lt;/ref&gt; This way, shooters can measure progress and compare themselves with other shooters of the same classification in the match results. A classification is division specific, and an athlete may therefore have different classifications in different divisions.

In order to be classified, you must first [http://www.ipsc-tech.org/ics/hq/embdAliasReg.aspx#TopOfPage register an ICS alias] which must be used when signing up for matches. An athlete is then classified within a division after the 4 first classification results. A classification result can be achieved in three ways:
* By shooting a standardized '''CLS''' stage ('''Cl'''assifier '''S'''tage), for example on a club training.
* By competing in a match containing a standardized CLS stage.
* By competing in a "classification match", which means a level 3 match with at least 10 participants within the division, and where at least 30% of the participants in that division already are classified. (A classification match does not have to contain a CLS stage.)

Once initial classification has been achieved, the classification will be updated based on the average of the 4 best of the 8 last results. The ICS system is dynamic, and can change based on the results being reported. For example, a result from a CLS stage will at any given time be calculated based on the highest hit factor ever shot for that particular CLS stage. In order to maintain their classification, an athlete each calendar year at least have to achieve a result in either one classification match or two CLS stages.

'''La Plata Rugby Club''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[rugby union]] club from the city of [[La Plata]] in [[Buenos Aires Province]].&lt;ref name="URBA club sheet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.urba.org.ar/clubes/guia-de-clubes/club/34/la-plata-rugby-club/ |title=URBA club sheet | publisher=''[[URBA|www.urba.org.ar]]'' |language=Spanish |date=21 May 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club currently plays in Primera División A, the second division of the [[Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires]] league system.

==History==
In 1924, members of the [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] section of multi-sports [[Club Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata]] decided to try a new sport, so they could stay fit during the winter period. After a visit from players of [[Club Atlético San Isidro|CASI]], rugby was chosen.

The rugby section of CGE La Plata officially opened and registered with the [[Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires]] in 1925. Eight years later, [[association football|football]] became professional in [[Argentina]] and URBA decided that rugby teams could not be part of professional clubs as rugby is an amateur sport in Argentina.

In 1934, the rugby section of Club Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata unmerged to become an independent club. Five years later the club would change its name to "La Plata Rugby Club" and severe all remaining ties with Gimnasia y Esgrima.

La Plata Rugby Club is the leading rugby club in [[La Plata]] with more than 1,000 players and 4,500 members. Many players have gone on to play for [[Argentina national rugby union team|the national team]] and professional clubs in Europe.

Nowadays the club plays at the highest level of URBA's league system, fielding teams at all levels.

This '''list of Australian cruiserweight boxing champions''' is a table showing the [[Boxing|boxers]] who have won the [[Australian]] professional [[cruiserweight (boxing)|cruiserweight]] championship.

The title has been administered by the [[Australian National Boxing Federation]] (previously the Australian Boxing Federation) since 1965, and prior to that by [[Stadiums Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anbf.org.au/history-of-anbf/|title=HISTORY OF ANBF – ANBF|website=anbf.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A champion will often voluntarily relinquish the title in order to fight for a higher-ranked championship, such as the [[List of current world boxing champions|world]]. Where the date on which a champion relinquished the title is unclear, the date of his final defence is shown.

&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ndash; Champion relinquished title.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ndash; Champion stripped of title.&lt;br/&gt;

==Medical uses==
Methyltestosterone is or has been used in the treatment of [[delayed puberty]], [[hypogonadism]], [[cryptorchidism]], and [[erectile dysfunction]] in males, and in low doses to treat [[menopause|menopausal symptom]]s (specifically for [[osteoporosis]], [[hot flash]]es, and to increase [[libido]] and [[energy (psychological)|energy]]), [[postpartum]] [[breast pain]] and [[breast engorgement|engorgement]], and [[breast cancer]] in women.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebadi2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manuchair Ebadi|title=Desk Reference of Clinical Pharmacology, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ihxyHbnj3qYC&amp;pg=PA434|date=31 October 2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-4744-8|pages=434–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YagielaDowd2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1= John A.

The dosages of methyltestosterone used are 10 to 50&amp;nbsp;mg/day in men for common medical uses like hypogonadism and delayed puberty as well as physique- and performance-enhancing purposes and 2.5&amp;nbsp;mg/day in women for menopausal symptoms.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Micromedex"&gt;http://www.micromedexsolutions.com/micromedex2&lt;/ref&gt; Higher dosages of 50 to 200&amp;nbsp;mg/day have been used to treat women with inoperable breast cancer that has failed to respond to other therapies, although such dosages are associated with severe irreversible virilization.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Micromedex" /&gt;

{{Androgen replacement therapy formulations and dosages used in women}}

==Non-medical uses==
Methyltestosterone is used for [[performance-enhancing drug|physique- and performance-enhancing purpose]]s by [[competition|competitive]] [[athlete]]s, [[bodybuilder]]s, and [[powerlifter]]s, although it is not commonly used relative to other AAS for such purposes.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;

==Contraindications==
Methyltestosterone should be used with caution in women and children, as it can cause irreversible virilization.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt; Due to its estrogenicity, methyltestosterone can also accelerate [[epiphyseal closure]] and thereby produce [[short stature]] in children and adolescents.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt; It can worsen symptoms in men with [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]].&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt; Methyltestosterone should not be used in men with [[prostate cancer]], as androgens can accelerate [[tumor progression]].&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt; The drug should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing [[hepatotoxicity]], due to its own potential for hepatotoxicity.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

[[Adverse effect]]s of methyltestosterone include [[androgen]]ic side effects like [[oily skin]], [[acne]], [[seborrhea]], increased [[facial hair|facial]]/[[body hair]] [[hair growth|growth]], [[pattern hair loss|scalp hair loss]], increased [[aggressiveness]] and [[sex drive]], and [[spontaneous erection]]s, as well as [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]ic side effects like [[breast tenderness]], [[gynecomastia]], [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]], and [[edema]].&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; In women, methyltestosterone can cause partially irreversible [[virilization]], for instance [[voice deepening]], [[hirsutism]], [[clitoromegaly]], [[breast atrophy]], and [[muscle hypertrophy]], as well as [[menstrual irregularity|menstrual disturbance]]s and reversible [[infertility]].&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; In men, the drug may also cause [[hypogonadism]], [[testicular atrophy]], and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;

Methyltestosterone can sometimes cause [[hepatotoxicity]], for instance [[elevated liver enzymes]], [[cholestatic jaundice]], [[peliosis hepatis]], [[hepatoma]]s, and [[hepatocellular carcinoma]], with extended use.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aronson2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey K.

==Interactions==
[[Aromatase inhibitor]]s can be used to reduce or prevent the [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]ic effects of methyltestosterone and [[5α-reductase inhibitor]]s can be used to prevent its potentiation in so-called "androgenic" tissues and thereby improve its ratio of [[anabolic]] to [[androgen]]ic activity and reduce its rate of androgenic [[side effect]]s.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt; [[Antiandrogen]]s like [[bicalutamide]] and [[cyproterone acetate]] can block both the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS like methyltestosterone.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
As an AAS, methyltestosterone is an [[agonist]] of the [[androgen receptor]] (AR), similarly to [[androgen]]s like [[testosterone]] and [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT).&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kicman |first1=A T |title=Pharmacology of anabolic steroids |journal=British Journal of Pharmacology |volume=154 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=502–521 |doi=10.1038/bjp.2008.165|pmid=18500378 |pmc=2439524}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for [[5α-reductase]] like testosterone, and so is potentiated analogously in so-called "androgenic" tissues like the [[skin]], [[hair follicle]]s, and [[prostate gland]] via [[biotransformation|transformation]] into the more [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] AR agonist [[mestanolone]] (17α-methyl-DHT).&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; As such, methyltestosterone has a relatively low ratio of [[anabolic]] to [[androgen]]ic activity, with a similar ratio to that of testosterone (close to 1:1), and this makes it among the most androgenic AAS.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; Due to efficient [[aromatization]] into the potent and [[metabolic stability|metabolism-resistant]] [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] [[methylestradiol]] (17α-methylestradiol), methyltestosterone has relatively high [[estrogen]]icity and hence potential for [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]ic [[side effect]]s such as [[gynecomastia]] and [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]].&lt;ref name="ThiemeHemmersbach2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Genazzani2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrea R. Genazzani|title=Postmenopausal Osteoporosis: Hormones &amp; Other Therapies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7tzqD9J7TgC&amp;pg=PA243|date=17 January 2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|isbn=978-1-84214-311-7|pages=243–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug possesses negligible [[progestogen]]ic activity.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt;

Due to its combined disadvantages of a relatively poor ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, unusually high estrogenicity, and the potential for [[hepatotoxicity]] (as with other 17α-alkylated AAS), methyltestosterone has not been used as commonly as many other AAS either in medicine or for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;

===Pharmacokinetics===
Methyltestosterone has dramatically improved [[oral administration|oral]] [[bioavailability]] and [[metabolic stability]] relative to testosterone.&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; This difference is due to the C17α methyl group, which results in [[steric hindrance]] and prevents [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name="Llewellyn2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kicman2008" /&gt; The oral bioavailability of methyltestosterone is about 70%, and it is [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|well-absorbed]] from the [[gastrointestinal tract]].&lt;ref name="LemkeWilliams2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas L.

The '''points classification in the Vuelta a España''' is a secondary classification in the [[Vuelta a España]], in which the cyclists are ranked in a [[points classification]] based on the finish of each rider every stage.

==History ==
For the first time, a points classification was calculated in 1945, sponsored by Pirelli. It was calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1945/03/22/pagina-1/656447/pdf.html|title=25000 pesetas de la Case Pirelli para la Vuelta Ciclista a España|language=Spanish|date=22 March 1945|accessdate=9 May 2014|work=El Mundo Deportivo|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The winner of a stage received 100 points, the second 99, and so on. If cyclists arrived in a group that was given the same time, they all received the same number of points.
*The first five cyclists in a stage received 12 points for every minute that they arrived ahead of the number six of the stage.
*For every point scored for the [[mountains classification in the Vuelta a España|mountains classification]], two points were given for this points classification.
*On intermediate sprints, points could be won: 8 for the winner, 6 for the second, 4 and 2 for the next.

Although the sponsor said that the classification was a great success,&lt;ref name="elm1945"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1945/06/02/pagina-11/33092141/pdf.html|title=V Vuelta Ciclista a España Pirelli|language=Spanish|date=22 March 1945|accessdate=9 May 2014|work=El Mundo Deportivo|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; it did not return [[1946 Vuelta a España|the next edition]].

The next time that a points classification was calculated, was in 1955. Then it used the method of adding the stage ranks, in the same way as the [[points classification in the Tour de France]] did then; just like in the Tour de France, the leader of the points classification (with the fewest points) wore a green jersey. In 1963, the points system changed such that from now on points were given to the first cyclists to reach the finish, and the cyclist with the most points was the leader.

[[Sean Kelly (cyclist)|Seán Kelly]] and [[Laurent Jalabert]], with 4 titles each, share the record of victories.

==Current system==
Points are awarded according to placement at the finish line and at intermediate points of every stage and the rider with the most points wears the jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://inrng.com/2013/08/vuelta-jerseys/|title=The Jerseys of the Vuelta a España|website=inrng.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Intermediate sprint||4||3||2|| || || || || || || || || || || ||
|}

This system unlike the Tour de France &amp; the Giro d'Italia, gives equal amount of points in the mountains compared to the flats, this paired with the high number of summit finishes at the Vuelta means there’s a correlation between the overall classification and the points jersey. A good example from 2012 when sprinter John Degenkolb won five stages but only finished fourth in the points competition with Alejandro Valverde well ahead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1761">In England, "'''prawn sandwich brigade'''" is a derogatory term for the people who attend [[Association football]] matches primarily to enjoy [[luxury box]]es and corporate hospitality, rather than support a team or enjoy the sport.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041025002004/http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/Kind=128/newsId=248342.html uefa.com - Magazine] &lt;/ref&gt;

The term originated from a media comment by [[Manchester United]] captain [[Roy Keane]] who felt certain sections of the crowd had not been vocal enough in their support, and at times too quick to criticise minor mistakes, during the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] game against [[Dynamo Kyiv]] in November 2000:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/1014868.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; CHAMPIONS LEAGUE &amp;#124; Angry Keane slates Man Utd fans |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-11-09 |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Away from home our fans are fantastic, I'd call them the hardcore fans. But at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch.}}

The term is often attributed to a direct Keane quote; in fact the term originated in the print media in reaction to Keane's comments.

The 2009 film ''[[The Damned United]]'' depicts [[Brian Clough]] castigating the directors of [[Derby County F.C.]] for luxuriating in corporate hospitality suites with "prawn sandwiches", but failing to understand the game of football. The scene is set in 1973, but Clough's tirade in the film was probably inspired by Roy Keane's comments of 2000.

'''Ross Memorial Park and Alexandre Stadium''' is a combined multi-purpose outdoor athletic facility in [[North Franklin Township, Pennsylvania]] owned by [[Washington &amp; Jefferson College]].

Located adjacent to [[CONSOL Energy Park]], the facility accommodates two full soccer and lacrosse fields.&lt;ref name=athletics /&gt; In the fall, Alexandre Stadium is home to the college’s men’s and women’s soccer teams; in the spring, the men’s lacrosse team.&lt;ref name=athletics /&gt;

The facility also is home to the Ross Locker Room facility, providing an official home for baseball, men's and women's soccer, and men's and women's lacrosse.&lt;ref name=ross /&gt; The facility, adjacent to the fields, houses three full-sized locker rooms, an athletic training room, an officials' locker room, and an equipment and laundry room.&lt;ref name=ross /&gt; The locker room facility was dedicated on April 19, 2008 in honor of James David Ross, thanks to a generous gift from the Ross family.&lt;ref name=ross /&gt; Ross was a manager of the [[Lower Burrell, Pennsylvania|Lower Burrell]] American Legion baseball team for 22 years, amassing over 600 wins leading the program to 17 league championships and eight [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]] titles.&lt;ref name=ross&gt;{{cite web| title = Ross Locker Rooms | publisher = Washington&amp; Jefferson College| date = | url = http://www.washjeff.edu/content.aspx?section=648&amp;menu_id=163&amp;crumb=200&amp;id=11659| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sri Lanka]]n cricket team was touring Pakistan in January and February 2009. The series was the first Test tour of Pakistan since South Africa visited in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/298999.html Cricinfo – South Africa in Pakistan Test Series, 2007/08]&lt;/ref&gt; The tour was arranged as a replacement for the scheduled tour of India which was cancelled by [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]] following [[2008 Mumbai attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/383401.html|title=Sri Lanka have confirmed tour – Pakistan board|date=10 December 2008|work=Cricinfo Pakistan|accessdate=3 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour included 3 [[One Day International|ODI]]s and 2 [[Test (cricket)|Tests]].

The safety of touring cricket teams in Pakistan had long been in issue.

The geography and geology of the [[Kalahari Desert]] and this part of Africa, create unique conditions for [[thermal]]s, which allow the naturally powered gliders to fly at higher altitudes, for longer length of time, at various velocities. For record flights established a [[tree]] is planted in the area, traditionally a [[Arecaceae|palm tree]] with plate.

[[File:TowelTablet.jpg|thumb|photo of towel tablet]]
A '''towel tablet''' is a fiber [[towel]] that is compressed into the shape and size of a small [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]].{{clarify|date=January 2011}} The towel tablet expands when [[water]] is added to the tablet. Typically the expanded towel size is approximately 26&amp;nbsp;cm by 20&amp;nbsp;cm (10" x 8"). Typical uses are for [[travel]], large events, and other situations where [[Disposable towel|disposable hygiene towels]] are needed.

The compressed toilet tablet is made from 100% natural viscose rayon, which is a fiber of regenerated cellulose. It is a β-D-glucose polymer having the [[empirical formula]] (C6H10O5)n.

[[Cellulose fiber|Cellulose]] is structurally similar to cotton and is generally derived from various plants like Soy, Bamboo or Sugarcane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blognox.com/compressed-toilet-paper-tablet/|title=Compressed toilet paper tablet {{!}} Revolutionize your camping experience|date=2017-09-15|work=BlogNox|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6987">A '''transposition''' in [[chess]] and other chess-like games is a sequence of moves that results in a position which may also be reached by another, more common sequence of moves.  Transpositions are particularly common in the [[chess opening|opening]], where a given position may be reached by different sequences of moves. Players sometimes use transpositions deliberately in order to avoid variations they dislike, lure opponents into unfamiliar or uncomfortable territory or simply to worry opponents.&lt;ref name="AboutDotComIntroTo1d4"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chess.about.com/od/improveyouropenings/ss/aa03c15_9.htm | title=Chess Opening Tutorial : Introduction to 1.d4 | author=Mark Weeks | publisher=about.com | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125081835/http://chess.about.com/od/improveyouropenings/ss/aa03c15_9.htm | archivedate=2008-01-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SoltisTranspoTricks"&gt;{{cite book | title=Transpo Tricks in Chess | author=Soltis, A. | publisher=Batsford | year=2007 | isbn=0-7134-9051-9 | authorlink=Andrew Soltis }} See review at {{cite web | url=http://www.chessville.com/reviews/TranspoTricks.htm | title=Transpo Tricks in Chess - review | publisher=chessville.com | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418115252/http://www.chessville.com/reviews/TranspoTricks.htm | archivedate=2008-04-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chess the verb "'''transpose'''" means to shift the game onto a different opening track from that on which it started.

[[Transposition table]]s are an essential part of a [[computer chess]] program.

==Examples==

===Positions reached by different routes===

|Position can arise from Queen's Gambit or English Opening.
}}

For instance, the first position can be obtained from the [[Queen's Gambit]]:

:'''1. d4 d5'''
:'''2. c4 e6'''
:'''3. Nc3 Nf6'''

But this position can also be reached from the [[English Opening]]:

:'''1. c4 Nf6'''
:'''2. Nc3 e6'''
:'''3. d4 d5'''
so the English Opening has transposed into the Queen's Gambit.
This position is the [[Blackmar–Diemer Gambit]]:

:'''1. d4 d5'''
:'''2. e4'''

But this position can also be reached from the [[Scandinavian Defence]]:

:'''1. e4 d5'''
:'''2. d4'''

The second position shows another example.  The position can arise from the [[French Defence]]:
:'''1. e4 e6'''
:'''2. d4 d5'''
:'''3. exd5 exd5'''
:'''4. Nf3 Nf6'''
The identical position can also be reached, with two extra moves played by each side, from the [[Petrov Defense]]:

:'''1. e4 e5'''
:'''2. Nf3 Nf6'''
:'''3. Nxe5 d6'''
:'''4. Nf3 Nxe4'''
:'''5. d3 Nf6'''

|''[[Isolani]]'' position which can arise from the Queen's Gambit, Nimzo-Indian and Caro-Kann among other openings.
}}
The position on the right, featuring an ''[[isolani]]'' can be reached by many different openings and move orders.  For example, there's the [[Nimzo-Indian Defence]]:
:'''1. d4 Nf6'''
:'''2. c4 e6'''
:'''3. Nc3 Bb4'''
:'''4. e3 0-0'''
:'''5. Bd3 c5'''
:'''6. Nf3 cxd4'''
:'''7. exd4 d5'''
:'''8. 0-0 dxc4'''
:'''9. Bxc4 Nc6'''
:'''10. a3 Be7'''

[[Caro–Kann Defence]]:

:'''1. e4 c6'''
:'''2. d4 d5'''
:'''3. exd5 cxd5'''
:'''4. c4 Nf6'''
:'''5. Nc3 e6'''
:'''6. Nf3 Bb4'''
:'''7. Bd3 dxc4'''
:'''8. Bxc4 0-0
:'''9. 0-0 Nc6
:'''10. a3 Be7

===Transposition possibilities of some openings===
Some openings are noted for their wide range of possible transpositions, for example the [[Catalan Opening]] and  [[Sicilian Defence]].&lt;ref name="SoltisTranspoTricks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FineIdeasBehind"&gt;{{cite book | author=Fine, R. | title=Ideas Behind the Chess Openings | publisher=Random House | isbn=0-8129-1756-1 | year=1990|origyear=1943 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a simple example, the opening moves 1.d4 e6 can transpose very quickly into a wide range of openings, including:

'''Waverley Park''' (originally '''VFL Park''') was an [[Australian rules football]] [[stadium]] in [[Mulgrave, Victoria]],  [[Australia]]. For most of its history, its purpose was as a neutral venue and used by all Victorian based [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League/Australian Football League]] clubs. However, during the 1990s it became the home ground of both the [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] football clubs. It ceased to be used for AFL games from the 2000 season, following the opening of [[Docklands Stadium]]. It is currently used as a training venue by Hawthorn. The main grandstand and oval are listed on the [[Victorian Heritage Register]].&lt;ref name="heritagedatabase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/vhd/heritagevic#detail_places;6059|title=Victorian Heritage Database|publisher=Hertitige Victoria|accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[seating capacity]] is now 8,000, down from a peak of 72,000.

==Origins==
Waverley Park (then VFL Park) was first conceived in 1959 when delegates from the 12 [[Australian Football League|VFL]] clubs requested the league to find land that was suitable for the building of a new stadium. In September 1962, the VFL had secured a 212-acre (860,000&amp;nbsp;m²) block of grazing and market garden land in [[Mulgrave, Victoria|Mulgrave]]. This area was chosen because it was believed that with the effects of [[urban sprawl]] and the proposed building of the South-Eastern (later called [[Monash Freeway|Monash]]) freeway, the area would become the [[demographic]] centre of [[Melbourne]]. The VFL reportedly lobbied the state government to construct a train connection to the stadium, but this never occurred.

The original plans were for a stadium catering for up to 157,000 patrons, which would have made it one of the biggest stadiums in the world. To accommodate the large number of patrons the members' stand was to be extended around the whole ground. However, in 1982 and/or 1983 when the extensions were due to commence, the [[Government of Victoria]] (led by [[Premier of Victoria|Victorian Premier]] [[John Cain (junior)|John Cain]] who was a member of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]] (MCC)) refused to approve the plans for the upgrade because it would have threatened the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]'s right to host the [[AFL Grand Final|VFL Grand Final]] (the league owned VFL Park had originally been built with the intent of replacing the MCG as the permanent home of the grand final, but the Victorian government, with interests in the MCG, refused to allow its capacity upgrade). Hence, no further development ever occurred and the capacity was set at just over 100,000 patrons (later reduced to 72,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bednall|first1=Jai|title=The 157,000-seat super stadium that never was|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/the-157000seat-super-stadium-that-never-was/news-story/2c031a2774cc7e2353cf3857f3985723|website=news.com.au|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The playing surface of 200&amp;nbsp;metres long and 160&amp;nbsp;metres wide was the biggest in the league. This caused some controversy and the boundary lines were repainted and goals were relocated to make the playing area a similar size to the MCG's playing surface {{When|date=December 2017}} {{Ambiguous|date=December 2017}} {{Clarify|date=December 2017}} .

==Construction==
Under the direction of architect Reginald E. Padey, work was started at the site on 5 January 1966 when the VFL President [[Sir Kenneth Luke]] turned the first sod.  On construction of the stadium, a total of {{convert|378000|cuyd|m3|abbr=off}} of topsoil was excavated and the surface of the oval was lowered to a depth of {{convert|27|ft|m|abbr=off}} from the surrounding area.  The soil was used to form the banks for some sections of the stadium.

The foundations for the K.G. Luke stand were laid in 1969 and more than {{convert|12|miles|km|abbr=off}} of solid concrete terracing was laid around the ground. Finally, on 18 April 1970, [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] and [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] played the first game at Waverley Park, to a crowd of 25,887.  However, the stadium was far from completed.  In fact the only section of the actual grandstand that was built was the first level of the K.G. Luke Stand. The rest of the stadium had only been completed on the ground level.

The Public Reserve Stands encircling the rest of the stadium were finished at a cost of $4.5&amp;nbsp;million in 1974 and the car parking was extended to fit a total of 25,000 cars. Lighting was added in May 1977, at a cost of $1.2&amp;nbsp;million, for the first of the 1977 night series televised matches. In 1982 a monochrome video matrix scoreboard was in operation at Waverley Park for the first time in VFL history, displaying instant replay highlights. In 1984 the arena was re-turfed and the drainage system upgraded.  Two years later a mosaic mural perpetuating many great names of VFL football was installed on the grandstand facade above the members' entrance. During the 1988 season automatic turnstiles were introduced at the members' entrance.

==Memorable events==
* The first ever final played at the ground was also the first ever elimination final played in AFL history, played between St Kilda and Essendon in 1972.
* During the 1973 season, 42,610 attended the first interstate match at the ground (between [[Victoria Australian rules football team|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia Australian rules football team|Western Australia]]) and a record 60,072 attended the second semi-final between [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] and [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]].
* Essendon and Carlton contested a once-off match on [[Anzac Day]] in 1975 (which Essendon won) in front of a crowd of 77,770.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.essendonfc.com.au/club/history.asp | title = Club History | work = [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon FC]] | accessdate = 2007-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The record attendance was 92,935 for Collingwood versus Hawthorn in 1981.
* In 1977 Fitzroy played [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] in the first night match at the stadium in the Amco-Herald Cup. The game started 55 minutes late after the State Electricity Commission's supply to the $1 million lighting system failed just ten minutes before the game was due to begin. A fuse was thought to have blown in the feeder pole to the ground. All power to the ground was turned off for 18 minutes while it was repaired.
* In 1977 VFL Park played host to the first 'Supertest' of Kerry Packer's [[World Series Cricket]].  It was also host to the first ever day-night cricket game.
* On November 15, 1980 [[KISS (band)]] played for a crowd of over 40,000 on their first tour of Australia.
* In 1987 Fitzroy played [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] in the first night match at the stadium for premiership points in the major competition. A total of 183,383 people watched the three finals games at VFL Park and the preliminary final attendance of 71,298 was the largest since 1984. The game was between [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] and Hawthorn and the game was described as the most epic played at VFL Park, with Hawthorn winning from a goal kicked after the siren, by [[Gary Buckenara]] after a 15-metre penalty was awarded against [[Jim Stynes]].
* In 1989 a match was played for premiership points on a Sunday at VFL Park for the first time.
* The ground hosted its first and only [[1991 AFL Grand Final|AFL Grand Final]] in 1991, which was contested by Hawthorn and the [[West Coast Eagles]] because the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] at the time was undergoing construction of the [[Great Southern Stand]]. Hawthorn defeated West Coast by 53 points in front of a crowd of 75,230.
* In 1996 an unexpected [[pitch invasion]] occurred when the lights went out at the stadium in a night game between Essendon and St Kilda, during the third quarter due to a car hitting a transmission tower nearby. After declaring the match finished for the evening the AFL commission held an emergency meeting to decide what should happen as there was no provision in the official rules for an event like this.  They decided to continue the match three days later. Essendon kept their winning position comfortably, starting with a 20-point lead and winning with a 22-point margin.  Controversially, the Bombers made five changes to their line-up between the two parts of the match.&lt;ref name="round 10 1996"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.vicnet.net.au/~brad/96/round10.htm|title=Round 10, 1996|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Essendon players, James Hird, managed to pick up match votes in some of the media awards.  Prior to the match, St Kilda coach Stan Alves complained about the situation and stated that his team is "not going to go kamikaze" and risk an injury when they did not have much chance of winning. The AFL subsequently decided on a set of rules to be applied for incidents of this kind, those being that if a game is not started the league in control of the match shall determine the result. Games that start but are interrupted prior to half time are deemed to be drawn if the game can not recommence within 30 minutes, while if the game is interrupted after half time the scores at the time are deemed to be final.&lt;ref name="laws2014p31"&gt;{{cite book|title=Laws Of Australian Football 2014|publisher=Australian Football League|location=Melbourne, Australia|pages=31–32|chapter=Part D: Pre-Match and Match Provisions|accessdate=15 June 2014|url=http://www.afl.com.au/staticfile/AFL%20Tenant/AFL/Files/Images/2212%20LawsAusFootball_Web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football records==
In its history, 732 AFL/VFL matches were played at Waverley Park, 70 of which were finals and one a grand final.
* Highest score: [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]]: 36.22 (238) v Melbourne: 6.12 (48) in round 17, 1979

==Closure==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
Perhaps the beginning of the end for Waverley Park was in 1988 when [[Alkali–silica_reaction|concrete cancer]] was discovered in the Southern Stand at the MCG. This provided the opportunity to replace the 50-year-old stand with a state of the art facility that was completed in 1992 at a cost of $150 million, subsequently named the Great Southern Stand. This affected Waverley Park's attendances as the ground once hosted many blockbuster games and finals, they were then mostly moved to the more modern, larger and more centrally located Melbourne Cricket Ground where the ground could handle up to 100,000 spectators compared to 72,000 at Waverley.

In 1999 the Australian Football League announced that it would not schedule any further matches at Waverley Park. Instead it would aim to
sell the ground and its surrounding land, hoping to raise a sum of $30 – $80 million to go towards the construction of a new stadium under construction at Docklands at the western end of the Melbourne central business district.&lt;ref name=Whither&gt;Hay, R., Lazenby, C., Haig-Muir, M. and Mewett, P. (2002) [http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30004696/hay-whithersportingheritage-2001.pdf 'Whither Sporting Heritage: reflections on debates in Victoria about Waverley Park and the Melbourne Cricket Ground]', in Dr David S Jones (ed.), 20th Century Heritage&amp;nbsp;– Our Recent Cultural Legacy: Proceedings of the [[Australia ICOMOS]] National Conference 2001, pp. 367-370, University of Adelaide, Adelaide.&lt;/ref&gt; Later the League would also argue that a portion of the income from the sale of Waverley
would provide further finance for the development of AFL football as a national code in Australia.&lt;ref name=Whither/&gt; The last official AFL game was played in 1999 between [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] in front of a sell-out crowd of 72,130.

After the decision to close the venue was made by the AFL, the ground's drawbacks were highlighted. Despite an excellent playing surface and its own water storage, focus shifted to its unfavourable position, and its antiquated corporate and spectator facilities, such as the 17-year-old sepia-toned video screen. Even though Waverley Park was only 20 minutes from the Melbourne CBD and was serviced by the [[Monash Freeway|Monash]] Freeway, successive governments had failed to provide adequate public transport to the venue. The stadium's car park was large enough to service its crowds, but the access roads were incapable of dispersing them, and long delays for driving spectators were common. Spectators felt distanced from the game in the huge arena,&lt;ref name="austadiums"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/stadiums.php?id=133|title=Waverley Park|date=12 March 2006|publisher=Austadiums.com|accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seating was only partly undercover  giving it the unflattering nickname "Arctic Park"&lt;ref name=Whither/&gt; which was due to its location on an exposed site, with the prevailing south-westerly winds bringing rain to Melbourne's eastern suburbs directly from [[Port Phillip]].

In 2000, AFL pre-season cup matches were played at the venue, and Victorian Football League games also took place there, including finals and the grand final.  Melbourne's Eastern Football League also played division 1 and division 2 Grand Finals at the venue at the conclusion of the 2000 season. The 2000 VFL Grand Final was the last official game of football played at the venue. After the 2000 VFL Grand Final, Waverley Park was not maintained and vandals broke onto the site smashed windows, sprayed graffiti on walls and one of the super boxes got trashed. The playing surface, once one of the best in Australia, was reduced to a field of weeds. Victorian MP [[Mary Delahunty]] called on the AFL to mow the dilapidated stadium, as it was still under their control.&lt;ref name="austadiums" /&gt;

On 10 December 2001 the AFL confirmed that the land was sold to housing developer [[Mirvac]] to assist in financing the construction of the now complete [[Docklands Stadium]].  The ground was demolished starting on 11 December 2002.&lt;ref name="austadiums" /&gt; While often seen as something of a failure, Waverley Park actually served an important strategic purpose for the VFL/AFL. With a viable alternative venue for the Grand Final and other events, the AFL possessed a critical bargaining chip in negotiations with the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]] over [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] access.

==Current status==
[[File:Waverley park mural.jpeg|thumb|150px|right|Waverley Park Members Stand Mural]]Following its cessation as a venue for AFL football, the stadium fell into a state of disrepair, and anticipating complete demolition, the City of Greater Dandenong, on behalf of football patrons in southeast Victoria,  moved quickly to nominate the whole of the facility and its grounds for heritage listing.  The basis for the nomination is that the stadium was the first major stadium purpose built for Australian rules football, that its construction and ownership by the VFL provided the basis on which the league built its power base and eventual evolution to become the AFL,  that it hosted the 1991 AFL Grand Final, that night time cricket games were first held at the ground, and that the members' (or K.G. Luke) stand features a mural of football legends by noted artist Harold Freedman.  The state level heritage listing of Waverley Park has been cited by the Executive Director of Heritage Victoria as the seminal case for an understanding of the cultural heritage significance of 20th century places.

Successful lobbying saw [[Heritage Victoria]] grant legislative protection to the site and, beginning in December 2002, portions of the stadium were demolished except for the members' stand and the members' stand mural.&lt;ref name="heritagedatabase" /&gt; The surrounding car park has been replaced by suburban housing, including 1400 new dwellings for 3500 people.  In homage to the original place and its purpose, the street layout mirrors the original car park and street names honour Waverley's patron Sir Kenneth Luke, architect Reginald Padey and other associations with football and cricket. The members' stand is visible from the nearby [[Monash Freeway]], however due to new noise walls being installed on the freeway alignment, the stand's visibility from the freeway has been significantly reduced.

The oval itself and the remaining section of the members stand have been redeveloped into a state-of-the-art training and administrative facility for the [[Hawthorn Football Club]] and the local community.  The facility incorporates an MCG-dimension oval, the size of the playing arena having been reduced from its original size, and includes a 25-metre heated indoor swimming pool, four refrigerated ice tanks, a gymnasium with a 60-metre running track and a warm-up area with projection and screen facilities to simulate match-day conditions. The grandstand has seating for around 2000 patrons with the seating in the top level of the grandstand having been retained.
