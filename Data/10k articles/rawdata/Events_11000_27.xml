The '''United States Army 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne),''' abbreviated as the 160th SOAR (A) and also known as '''Night Stalkers''', or within [[JSOC]] as '''Task Force Brown''',&lt;ref name="RelentStrike"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naylor|first1=Sean|title=Relentless Strike|location=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[special operations force]] of the [[United States Army]] that provides [[helicopter]] aviation support for general purpose forces and special operations forces. 

Its missions have included attack, assault, and reconnaissance, and are usually conducted at night, at high speeds, low altitudes, and on short notice. The 160th SOAR is headquartered at [[Fort Campbell]], [[Kentucky]].

==Overview==
The 160th SOAR (A) consists of the Army's best-qualified [[aviator]]s, crew chiefs, and support soldiers. Officers volunteer while enlisted soldiers volunteer or are assigned by the [[United States Army Human Resources Command|U.S. Army Human Resources Command]]. Until 2013, only men were allowed to be pilots in the 160th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/04/18/us-military-to-open-6200-new-jobs-to-women.html |title = US Military to open 6200 new jobs to women }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon joining the 160th, all soldiers are assigned to "Green Platoon", in which they receive intensive training in "advanced methods of the five basic combat skills: first responder, land navigation, combatives, weapons and teamwork".&lt;ref name="laudano2006" /&gt; The weapons training includes firing hundreds of rounds with the M9 pistol, M4 carbine, and AK-47 rifle. Soldiers who fail to pass the course a first time may retake it, but there is no guarantee that anyone assigned to Green Platoon will pass and continue on with the 160th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campbell.army.mil/newinternet/UnitPages/SpecialForces/greenplatoon.htm |title=160th SOAR(A) Green Platoon Train-up program |work=160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment |publisher=United States Army |accessdate=21 November 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531170029/http://www.campbell.army.mil/newinternet/UnitPages/SpecialForces/greenplatoon.htm  |archivedate = 31 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic Night Stalker course for enlisted soldiers lasts five weeks;&lt;ref name="laudano2006"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.fortcampbellcourier.com/news/article_d025cc07-8843-5b6d-b0bd-502f43edc167.html |title=Green Platoon — first step to SOAR |last=Laudano |first=Kimberly |date=Sep 28, 2006 |work=Fort Campbell Courier |access-date=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the officer course lasts 20 to 28 weeks.

A new Night Stalker arrives to a unit Basic Mission Qualified (BMQ). After a series of skills test qualifications, experience, leadership, and oral review boards lasting up to three years, the Night Stalker is designated Fully Mission Qualified (FMQ). After three to five years as an FMQ, the Night Stalker may try out for flight lead qualification.

==History==
===1980s and 1990s===
After the 1980 [[Operation Eagle Claw]] attempt to rescue [[Iran hostage crisis|American hostages]] held in [[Tehran]], Iran, failed, President [[Jimmy Carter]] ordered former [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Adm. [[James L. Holloway III]] to figure out how the U.S. military could best mount another attempt. At the time there were no U.S. helicopter units trained in this kind of stealthy, short-notice Special Operations mission.

The Army looked to the 101st Aviation Group, the air arm of the [[101st Airborne Division]] (Air Assault), which had the most diverse operating experience of the service's helicopter units, and selected elements of the 158th Aviation Battalion, 101st Aviation Battalion, 229th Aviation Battalion, and the 159th Aviation Battalion. The chosen pilots immediately entered intensive training in night flying.

This provisional unit was dubbed Task Force 158, since most of its pilots were Blackhawk aviators detached from the 158th. Their distinctive 101st "Screaming Eagle" patches remained on their uniforms. The Blackhawks and Chinooks continued to operate around Campbell Army Airfield at the north of post, and Saber Army Heliport at the south. The [[OH-6 Cayuse]]s, aircraft that had vanished from the division's regular inventory after Vietnam, were hidden on base in an ammunition holding area still known as the "SHOC Pad", for "Special Helicopter Operations Company".

As the first batch of pilots completed training in the fall of 1980, a second attempt to rescue the hostages was planned for early 1981. Dubbed [[Operation Honey Badger]], it was called off when the hostages were [[October Surprise|released]] on the morning of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s inauguration.

Task Force 158 was the Army's only special operations aviation unit, and its members had already become recognized as the Army's premier aviation night fighters. Their capability was judged too useful to lose, and so instead of returning to the 101st, the pilots and modified aircraft became a new unit. (Original members of the Night Stalkers refer to it as "the day the Eagles came off".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}) The unit was officially established on 16 October 1981, when it was designated as the 160th Aviation Battalion.

The 160th first saw combat during 1983's [[Operation Urgent Fury]], the U.S. invasion of [[Grenada]].

[[File:S64-Crew.gif|thumb|Super 6-4 one month before the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]. From left: Winn Mahuron, Tommy Field, Bill Cleveland, Ray Frank and [[Michael Durant]].]]

In 1986, it was renamed the 160th Aviation Group (Airborne); and in May 1990, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne). As demand for highly trained special operations aviation assets bloomed, the regiment activated three battalions, a separate detachment, and incorporated one [[Army National Guard]] unit, the 1st Battalion, 245th Aviation (OK ARNG).

In 1987 and 1988, its pilots took part in [[Operation Earnest Will]], the protection of re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. They flew from [[United States Navy|US Navy]] warships and leased oil barges in a secret sub-part called [[Operation Prime Chance]], and became the first helicopter pilots to use [[night vision device|night vision goggles]] and [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) devices in night combat.

In June 1988, the unit executed [[Operation Mount Hope III]]. Two MH-47 crews flew {{convert|490|mi|km}} deep into [[Chad]] to retrieve a crashed [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-24 Hind]] medium-attack helicopter.

The Night Stalkers spearheaded [[Operation Just Cause]], the 1989 invasion of [[Panama]], and they were also used in [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.

In October 1993 in [[Somalia]], Night Stalkers became involved in the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]], which later became the subject of the book ''[[Black Hawk Down (book)|Black Hawk Down]]'', and its [[Black Hawk Down (film)|film adaptation]]. Two Night Stalker Black Hawks, Super 6-1 (piloted by Cliff Wolcott), and Super 6-4 (piloted by [[Mike Durant]]), were shot down in the battle. Five of the eighteen men killed (not counting a nineteenth post-operation casualty) in the Battle of Mogadishu were members of the Night Stalkers team, who were lost along with the two Black Hawks.

===Global War on Terrorism===
====2001–2005====
During the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]], the Night Stalkers from 2nd Battalion supported two task forces established in early October 2001: [[United States invasion of Afghanistan#Command Structure|Dagger]] and [[United States invasion of Afghanistan#Command Structure|Sword]]. (Their unit in TF Sword was designated Task Force Brown.)&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh, ''Special Forces in the War on Terror'' (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.25, p.29, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; In the evening of 18 October into 19 October 2001, two SOAR [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|MH-47E]] helicopters, escorted by MH-60L DAPs (Direct Action Penetrators), airlifted U.S. troops from the [[Karshi-Khanabad Air Base]] in [[Uzbekistan]]&lt;ref name="specialops"&gt;{{cite web|title=Task Force Dagger - Operation Enduring Freedom |url=http://www.americanspecialops.com/operations/sof-afghanistan/task-force-dagger.php|accessdate=13 January 2012}} page 127ff&lt;/ref&gt; more than {{convert|300|km|sp=us}} across the {{convert|16000|ft||adj=on}} [[Hindu Kush]] mountains into Afghanistan. 

The pilots of the Chinooks, flying in zero-visibility conditions, were refueled in flight three times during the 11-hour mission, establishing a new world record for combat rotorcraft. The troops — two 12-man [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] teams from the [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th Special Forces Group]] dubbed Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 555 and 595&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh, ''Special Forces in the War on Terror'' (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.29, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; plus four [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|Air Force Combat Controllers]] — linked up with the CIA and Northern Alliance. Within a few weeks, the Northern Alliance, assisted by U.S. ground and air forces, captured several key cities from the Taliban.&lt;ref name="army.mil"&gt;[http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/go0610.pdf Units Credited With Assault Landings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gresham&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gresham|first1=John|title=The Campaign Plan – Special Operations Forces and Operation Enduring Freedom|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/operation-enduring-freedom-the-first-49-days-2/|accessdate=11 September 2015|date=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001,  Night Stalker AH-6J Little Birds took part in [[United States invasion of Afghanistan#Objective Wolverine, Raptor and Operation Relentless Strike|Objective Wolverine and Raptor missions and Operation Relentless Strike]].&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh, ''Special Forces in the War on Terror'' (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, Night Stalker crews resupplied more than 150 [[Delta Force]], British [[Special Boat Service]], and CIA [[Special Activities Division]] operatives as they [[Battle of Tora Bora|hunted]] for [[Osama bin Laden]] in the [[Tora Bora]] mountain complex.&lt;ref&gt;Fury, Dalton. Kill Bin Laden. St Martin's, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2002, in Afghanistan, Task Force Sword was renamed Task Force 11 and was composed of a DEVGRU and a company of Rangers, and was supported by a company of helicopters from the 160th SOAR. 

On 21 February 2002, while scouting Islamist terrorists on [[Basilan Island]] as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines]] and seeking to rescue a nurse and an American missionary couple, a MH-47 crashed at sea in the southern [[Philippines]]' [[Cebu Strait|Bohol Strait]], killing 10 servicemen (eight from E company, 160th SOAR and two from the [[353rd Special Operations Group]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/02/24/phil.us.crash/index.html |title='No survivors' in U.S. chopper crash |publisher=CNN  |date=24 February 2002 |accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icasualties.org/OEF/Fatalities.aspx |title=Operation Enduring Freedom casualties |publisher=iCasualties |date=24 December 2016 |accessdate=24 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203121759/http://icasualties.org/OEF/Fatalities.aspx |archivedate=3 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=sh&amp;GRid=10525501&amp;|title=Sgt Thomas Ferrell Allison (1979 - 2002) - Find A Grave Memorial|work=findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2002, Night Stalkers from B Company, 2nd Battalion, 160th SOAR supported coalition troops during [[Operation Anaconda]], particularly at the [[Battle of Takur Ghar]] on March 4, where one of their MH-47Es, callsign Razor 03, was damaged by rocket-propelled grenades and crash-landed carrying Mako 30. A second MH-47E, callsign Razor 01, responded to the shootdown with a [[Quick reaction force|Quick Reaction Force]]; it was damaged by small arms and rocket-propelled grenades, and crash-landed. One Night Stalker was killed in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh, ''Special Forces in the War on Terror'' (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, pp.29, 50, 58–59, 64–65, 185&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June 2002 in the Philippines, Night Stalker MH-47Es were involved in the operation that killed [[Abu Sabaya]], a senior leader in [[Abu Sayyaf|Abu Sayyef]]. A U.S. Predator drone marked the person with an infrared laser as he tried to escape in a smuggler's boat. The MH-47Es trained searchlights on the boat while operators from the Philippine [[Naval Special Operations Group]] opened fire, killing the terrorist leader and capturing four other terrorists with him.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh, ''Special Forces in the War on Terror'' (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, pp.29, 50, 58–59, 64–65, 185&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], 3rd Battalion, 160th SOAR, deployed as the Joint Special Operations Air Detachment-West under CJSOTF-West (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-West/Task Force Dagger). It was equipped with eight MH-47E Chinooks, four MH-60L DAPs, and two MH-60M Black Hawks. At 9 p.m. on 19 March 2003, the first strike of Operation Iraqi Freedom was carried out by members of the 160th SOAR, on Iraqi visual observation posts along the southern and western borders of Iraq. The strike groups included one flight of MH-60L DAPs and four "Black Swarm" flights, each consisting of a pair of AH-6M Little Birds; a FLIR-equipped, target-spotting MH-6M; and a pair of U.S. Air Force A-10As.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh, ''Special Forces in the War on Terror'' (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, pp. 90, 97, 130–134&lt;/ref&gt;

In seven hours, more than 70 sites were destroyed, effectively depriving the Iraqi military of any early warning of the coming invasion. As the sites were eliminated the first heliborne SOF teams launched from H-5 airbase in Jordan, including vehicle-mounted patrols from the British and Australian special forces, who were transported by the MH-47Es of the 160th SOAR. Nightstalkers from 1st Battalion 160th SOAR were tasked with supporting [[2003 invasion of Iraq#Initial infiltration|Task Force 20]] with its MH-60M Blackhawks, MH-60L DAPs, MH-6M transport and AH-6M Little Birds; they were based at [[Arar, Saudi Arabia|Ar'Ar]]. On March 26, the 160th SOAR took part in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq#|Objective Beaver]] mission, a raid by DEVGRU on a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre that was suspected to have stocks of chemical and biological weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh, ''Special Forces in the War on Terror'' (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, pp. 90, 97, 130–134&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2003, the 160th SOAR took part in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq#Jessica Lynch rescue|rescue mission]] of [[Private first class|PFC]] [[Jessica Lynch]] who was taken prisoner during the [[Battle of Nasiriyah]]. On April 2, a Delta Force squadron operating in Iraq was ambushed by a half-dozen armed technicals from an anti-special forces [[Fedayeen Saddam|Fedayeen]]. Two MH-60K Black Hawks carrying a parajumper medical team and two MH-60L DAPs of the 160th SOAR responded and engaged the Iraqis, which allowed the Delta operators to move their two casualties to an emergency HLZ. However, one Delta Force operator succumbed to his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh, ''Special Forces in the War on Terror'' (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, pp. 90, 97, 130–134&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of December 13, 2003, [[Saddam Hussein]] was captured by U.S. forces in [[Operation Red Dawn]], he was exfiltrated by a MH-6 Little Bird from the 160th SOAR and he was taken into custody at Baghdad International Airport.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh, ''Special Forces in the War on Terror'' (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.195-197&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2004 they took part in the rescue of three Italian contractors and one Polish businessman held for ransom by Iraqi insurgents.

In Afghanistan in 2005: Eight Night Stalkers (four from [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company (United States)|HHC]] and four from Bravo company of 3rd Battalion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soldiers.dodlive.mil/2014/02/honoring-the-u-s-army-heroes-of-operation-red-wings/|title=HONORING THE U.S. ARMY HEROES OF OPERATION RED WINGS|publisher=soldiers.dodlive.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;) were killed along with eight [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]] on a rescue mission for [[Marcus Luttrell]], after their [[CH-47 Chinook|MH-47 Chinook]] helicopter was hit by an RPG ([[rocket propelled grenade]]). They were sent out to look for Luttrell after [[Operation Red Wings]], in which he was involved with three other SEALs, was compromised and Luttrell's teammates killed.

====2006–2009====
In March 2006, SEALs from DEVGRU and Rangers were flown by the 160th SOAR into in [[North Waziristan]], [[Pakistan]], to assault an al-Qaeda training camp. In this Operation Vigilant Harvest, the assaulters killed as many as 30 terrorists including the camps commandant.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, Mark, ''Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq '', St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 {{ISBN|978-1250006967}}, p.232-233&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 14 May 2006, helicopters from the 160th SOAR brought operators from Delta Force's B Squadron to [[Yusufiyah]], Iraq, to fight al-Qaeda fighters in several buildings. As the operators disembarked their helicopters, they came under fire from a nearby house, and more al-Qaeda fighters soon joined the firefight. The door gunners of the 160th's Black Hawks fired at the insurgents; a pair of AH-6M Little Birds carried out strafing runs. One Little Bird from the 16oth's 1st Battalion, B Company, was shot down. An estimated 25 al-Qaeda fighters were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, Mark, ''Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq '', St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 {{ISBN|978-1250006967}}, p.154-156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2006, a pair of MH-47Es from 160th SOAR attempted to insert a combined strike element of DEVGRU, Rangers, and Afghan commandos in [[Helmand Province]], Afghanistan, to attack a compound. With some troops on the ground, a large insurgent force ambushed them. Both helicopters were struck by small arms fire. One MH-47E pilot put his aircraft in the line of fire to protect the other MH-47E as its assault team disembarked. An RPG hit the shielding MH-47E, whose pilot crash-landed with no serious injuries to operators or aircrew. The Ranger commander and an attached [[Australian commandos|Australian Commando]] organized an all-round defence while the other MH-47E held back the advancing insurgents until its miniguns ran out of ammunition. An [[AC-130]] Spectre joined the battle and kept the down crew and passengers safe until a British Immediate Response Team helicopter recovered them. The AC-130 then destroyed the MH-47E wreck, denying it to the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.236-237&lt;/ref&gt;

The assault force (4 AH-6M Little Birds and 4 MH-60L Blackhawks) carried in DEVGRU operators to kill or capture the leader. AH-6Ms strafed the two-vehicle convoy, killing the leader along with three other [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] terrorists, then carried out an overwatch while DEVGRU cleared the vehicles and recovered the body.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.243, p.282-284&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–====
In May 2011, the Night Stalkers provided insertion and cover for the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|raid on Osama bin Laden's compound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burns |first=Robert |date=6 May 2011 |title=Stealth chopper secrets may have been exposed |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/987241--stealth-chopper-secrets-may-have-been-exposed |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2012, [[List of operations conducted by SEAL Team Six#Operation Jubilee|Operation Jubilee]] took place: Blackhawks from the 160th SOAR flew in a teams from the British 22nd SAS Regiment and DEVGRU into [[Badakhshan Province]], Afghanistan so they could rescue a British aid worker, a Kenyan NGO worker and 2 Afghans who were taken hostage by Bandits in the province.

One American was wounded, no hostages were found, but a substantial number of terrorists were killed. CENTCOM mistakenly posted a video on the internet of a flight of four MH-60Ms of the 160th SOAR conducting a mid-air refueling over Iraq in October 2014, the video has hastily taken down. On November 26, 2014, MH-60s flown by Nightstalkers took part in the first raid in the [[2014 hostage rescue operations in Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, pp. 302, 307, 310&lt;/ref&gt;

The Night Stalkers continue to be deployed to Afghanistan as part of NATOs [[Resolute Support Mission]] after Operation Enduring Freedom-Afghanistan ended in late 2014 and was replaced with [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)#Post ISAF phase|Operation Freedom's Sentinel]]. Throughout that night of 5 December 2015, a group of Rangers engaged in a firefight with enemy troops near the Afghan-Pakistan border; after about 5 a.m. their commander called for an extraction after they learned of a larger enemy group approaching. A helicopter from the 160th SOAR arrived and began receiving heavy fire from the enemy, an AH-64 Apache helicopter from the 1st Battalion [[101st Aviation Regiment (United States)|101st Aviation Regiment]] escorting the helicopter, put their Apache directly between the U.S. troops, the helicopter and the enemy forces to draw the fire. As a result, the extraction was a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/story/military/2016/06/02/2-fort-campbell-soldiers-receive-distinguished-flying-cross/85304848/|title=2 Fort Campbell soldiers receive Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher=army times|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Washington Post'' reported that 160th SOAR took part in the [[Yakla raid]] in Yemen on 29 January 2017, distinguishing itself when its helicopters flew repeatedly into heavy enemy fire to support U.S. Navy SEALs pinned down on the ground. On 25 August 2017, a Black Hawk helicopter flown by the 160th SOAR crashed off the coast of Yemen while conducting hoist training when it lost power and crashed into the sea, six servicemen survived, one US service member remained missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/08/26/american-service-member-missing-after-black-hawk-helicopter-crash-off-yemen/ |title=Black Hawk helicopter that crashed off Yemen belonged to elite Special Operations air unit|publisher=Washington Post|date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''CNN'' reported that on 27 October 2017, a US helicopter from 4th Battalion 160th SOAR crashed in Logar province, Afghanistan, killing one and injuring 6 more US servicemembers, the crash was not a result of enemy action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/28/asia/afghanistan-chopper-crash/index.html|title=Pentagon identifies US service member killed in Afghanistan copter crash|publisher=CNN|date=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2015 Karachi traffic accident''' occurred on 10 January 2015, when a passenger bus in transit from [[Karachi]] to [[Shikarpur, Sindh|Shikarpur]] crashed into an oil tanker killing up to 62 people including 6 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/820038/bus-oil-tanker-collision-in-karachi-leaves-35-people-dead/|title=62 people die in Pakistan bus accident|publisher=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=11 January 2015|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bus was carrying up to 80 people, with 62 inside the bus and 10 on top, due to overcrowding. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1156334/fatal-crash-between-bus-oil-tanker-leaves-57-dead-near-karachi|title=62 die in Pakistan road accident|publisher=DAWN|date=January 11, 2015|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling in the morning, most of the passengers were asleep when the bus crashed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=62 killed in bus-oil tanker collision in southern Pakistan; police blame drivers|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-others/57-killed-in-bus-oil-tanker-collision-in-southern-pakistan/|publisher=The Indian Express|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Only traveling a small distance, the bus crashed in the outskirts of Karachi on a single track road that connects to the [[M-9 Super Highway|Super Highway]]. The crash occurred because of careless driving, as the driver of the tanker was speeding on the wrong side of the road, and poor conditions on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dozens die in bus crash near Pakistani city of Karachi|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30766412|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the crash, a gas cylinder ignited causing the bus to catch on fire.

==Background==
Transportation in [[Pakistan]] has been poor in recent years. According to the [[Pakistan Bureau of Statistics]] there are an average of 9,000 crashes and 4,500 deaths on the road each year.

==Aftermath==
After the crash, the driver of the oil tanker fled the scene. According to Dr. Seemi Jamali, the 62 bodies were taken to [[Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre]]. Chief minister of Sindh, [[Qaim Ali Shah]], ordered that there be an investigation into the crash.

==Notable events==
At the L.A.Con I masquerade, one of the contestants, artist [[Scott Shaw (artist)|Scott Shaw!]], came on stage wearing only a bathing suit, with his body completely covered with crunchy [[peanut butter]].  The name of his costume was "The Turd." from an underground comic story Shaw wrote and illustrated.  Since some of the peanut butter tended to drip off of him, making the floor sticky for other contestants, a rule was passed that forever after at science fiction convention masquerades, no peanut butter costumes would be allowed.  This masquerade rule is universally known among [[Science fiction fandom|science fiction fans]] as the "no peanut butter rule."&lt;ref name="nopb"/&gt; 

The first video game competition at a science fiction convention was held, and a science fiction fan named Kevan Pritchard from [[Lawndale, California]], won the world championship contest in the game ''[[Spacewar!]]''.

'''''Alice Cooper and Friends''''' was a [[live music]] [[television special]] starring [[Alice Cooper]]. Broadcast in the [[United States]] in September 1977, it was released on [[VHS]] in 1978. This rare video has a [[running time]] of 52 minutes, of which 25 minutes feature Cooper. It also features live footage of [[The Tubes]], [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]] and [[Sha Na Na]].

''Alice Cooper and Friends'' was filmed in concert on 19 June 1977 at the [[Anaheim Stadium]] in [[California]].&lt;ref name=collectors&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherman|first=Dale |title=The Illustrated Collector's Guide to Alice Cooper, 10th Anniversary Edition|publisher=Collector's Guide Publishing, Inc.|date=177|pages=172|isbn=978-1-894959-93-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first night of Cooper's "King of the Silver Screen" tour, in support of his album ''[[Lace and Whiskey]]''.&lt;ref name=collectors /&gt; The special captured a very [[drunken]] and lethargic performance by Cooper, which he himself has dismissed as his worst performance. The video does include the infamous ''Chickens with Machine Guns'' sequence during the song "Lace and Whiskey". This special was the only commercially released video footage from that tour.

The video of the special has been discontinued since its original release, and has not been issued on [[DVD]]. Used copies regularly appear for sale online.

The '''Associazione Agraria Subalpina''' (Subalpine Agrarian Association), was founded on 31 May 1842, under the sponsorship of [[Carlo Alberto]], king of [[Piedmont-Sardinia]], by a group of 36 intellectuals, landowners and politicians belonging to the [[Piedmont]]ese [[nobility]] and [[bourgeoisie]]. They included [[Camillo Benso di Cavour]], [[Carlo Ilarione Petitti di Roreto]], [[Cesare Alfieri di Sostegno]] (its first president) and [[Giovenale Vegezzi Ruscalla]] (its first [[secretary]]). Its primary aim was the promotion of efficient agricultural practices in Piedmont, but in the absence of effective political organisation in the kingdom—where there was no parliament, no political parties, no elections and no free press prior to the [[Statuto Albertino]] of 1848—it also provided a focus for passionate political debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paginecattoliche.it/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=916 Pagine cattoliche – Libro III Cap. 19 – La riunificazione italiana (I)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biederman's Cabin''', also called '''Biederman's Fish Camp''', is a privately owned cabin on the [[Yukon River]] in [[Alaska]]. Located within the [[Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve]], it is maintained as a historic site representing the subsistence lifestyle employed by [[Interior Alaska]] residents during the early years of the 20th century and is one of the few structures within the preserve.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service. [http://www.nps.gov/yuch/historyculture/historicsites.htm "Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve: Historic sites"], NPS.gov. August 8, 2006. Accessed March 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
The cabin was built in 1916 by Max Adolphus "Ed" Biederman for his family. Biederman was an immigrant to the United States from [[Bohemia]], and was attracted to Alaska in 1899 by the [[Nome Gold Rush]]. After failing to strike it rich, Biederman became a [[sled dog]] driver instead. In 1912, he began running the [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]] to [[Circle, Alaska|Circle]] mail route along the Yukon River. In 1916, he constructed the {{convert|31|ft|m|0}}-long log cabin and roofed it with [[sod]]. That year, his first daughter, Nellie Biederman, was born in the building.

Between 1916 and 1938, the Biederman family used the cabin as their summer residence after spending winters in Eagle while Ed ran his dog team and used the cabin as a waypoint between the two locations. Because other winter travelers needed a place to stay during the winter, Biederman constructed a small bunk house away from the cabin. To provide food for the many dogs Biederman owned as a result of the mail route, the family used the cabin as a fish camp and installed two [[fish wheel]]s to catch salmon swimming upstream during the spawning season. Other additions were made to the cabin, including a tin roof to replace the sod and an [[Arctic entry]]. In 1938, the dog sled mail route was discontinued, and in 1945, Ed Biederman died.

==Use as shelter==
After Biederman's death, the cabin fell into relative disuse by the family, though winter travelers continued to seek shelter in it. In 1984, the [[Yukon Quest]], a 1,000-mile sled dog race between [[Fairbanks, Alaska]], and [[Whitehorse, Yukon]], chose the cabin as an official rest area along the trail. Though the cabin's official status has been superseded by nearby [[Slaven's Cabin]], which is run by the [[National Park Service]], it continues to serve as an informal hospitality stop for competitors in the race.

A nearby wildfire threatened the cabin in 2007, and the National Park Service installed temporary sprinklers at the site as a preventative measure.&lt;ref&gt;Fire and Aviation Management.

'''Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin''' ({{lang-rus|Бори́с Никола́евич Е́льцин|a=ru-Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.ogg|p=bɐˈrʲis nʲɪkɐˈlaɪvʲɪtɕ ˈjelʲtsɨn}}; 1 February 1931 – 23 April 2007) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Russia]]n politician and the first [[President of Russia|President]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], serving from 1991 to 1999. Originally a supporter of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], Yeltsin emerged under the [[perestroika]] reforms as one of Gorbachev's most powerful political opponents. During the late 1980s, Yeltsin had been a candidate member of the [[Politburo]], and in late 1987 tendered a letter of resignation in protest. No one had resigned from the Politburo before. This act branded Yeltsin as a rebel and led to his rise in popularity as an anti-establishment figure.

On 29 May 1990, he was elected the chairman of the [[Russian Supreme Soviet]]. On 12 June 1991 he was [[Russian presidential election, 1991|elected]] by popular vote to the newly created post of President of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR). Upon the resignation of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] on 25 December 1991, the RSFSR became the sovereign state of the Russian Federation, and Yeltsin remained in office as president. He was reelected in the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|1996 election]], in which critics widely claimed pervasive corruption; in the second round he defeated [[Gennady Zyuganov]] from the revived [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]] by a margin of 13.7%. However, Yeltsin never recovered his early popularity after a series of economic and political crises in Russia in the 1990s.

Much of the Yeltsin era was marked by widespread corruption, and as a result of persistent low oil and commodity prices during the 1990s, Russia suffered inflation and [[economic collapse]]. Within a few years of his presidency, many of Yeltsin's initial supporters had started to criticize his leadership, and Vice President [[Alexander Rutskoy]] even denounced the reforms as "economic genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yeltsin Deputy calls reforms Economic Genocide|date=February 1992|accessdate=23 September 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/09/world/yeltsin-deputy-calls-reforms-economic-genocide.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|work=The New York Times|first=Celestine|last=Bohlen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing confrontations with the Supreme Soviet climaxed in the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993|1993 Russian constitutional crisis]] in which Yeltsin ordered the unconstitutional dissolution of the Supreme Soviet parliament, which as a result attempted to remove him from office.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Youth of Eltsin.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Yeltsin {{small|(second from left)}} with childhood friends]]
{{Yeltsin sidebar}}
Boris Yeltsin was born in the village of [[Butka, Russia|Butka, Talitsky District]], [[Sverdlovsk Oblast|Sverdlovsk]], [[Russian SFSR|USSR]], on 1 February 1931.&lt;ref name="Leon Aron 2000. page 739"&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. pg. 739; {{ISBN|0-00-653041-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, after the state took away the entire harvest from the recently collectivised Butka peasants, the Yeltsin family moved as far away as they could, to [[Kazan]], more than 1,100 kilometres from Butka, where Boris' father, Nikolai, found work on a building site. Growing up in rural Sverdlovsk, he studied at the [[Ural State Technical University]] (now Urals Polytechnic Institute), and began his career in the construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Nikolai Yeltsin was convicted of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|anti-Soviet agitation]] and sentenced to hard labour in a [[gulag]] for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/newsinreview/oct98/russia/timeline.htm|title=Timeline of a Leader|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=October 1998|accessdate=17 April 2007|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016142813/http://cbc.ca/newsinreview/oct98/russia/timeline.htm|archivedate =16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his release in 1936 after serving two years, Nikolai took his family to live in [[Berezniki]] in [[Perm Krai]], where his brother Ivan, a blacksmith, had been exiled the previous year for failing to deliver his grain quota.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Nikolai remained unemployed for a period of time and then worked again in construction. His mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Yeltsina, worked as a seamstress. Boris studied at [[Pushkin High School]] in Berezniki. He was fond of sports (in particular skiing, gymnastics, volleyball, track &amp; field, boxing and wrestling) despite losing the thumb and index finger of his left hand when he and some friends furtively entered a [[Red Army]] supply depot, stole several grenades, and tried to disassemble them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/magazinemonitor/2007/04/10_things_we_didnt_know_last_w_21.shtml|title=10 things we didn't know last week|publisher=BBC|date=27 April 2007|accessdate=29 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, he was admitted to the [[Ural State Technical University|Ural Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]], majoring in construction, and he graduated in 1955. The subject of his degree paper was "Construction of a Mine Shaft".&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1955-57 he worked as a foreman with the building trust Uraltyazhtrubstroy. From 1957-63, he worked in Sverdlovsk, and was promoted from construction site superintendent to chief of the Construction Directorate with the Yuzhgorstroy Trust. In 1963, he became chief engineer, and in 1965, head of the Sverdlovsk House-Building Combine, responsible for sewerage and technical plumbing. He joined the ranks of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] ''[[nomenklatura]]'' in 1968 when he was appointed head of construction with the Sverdlovsk Regional Party Committee. In 1975, he became secretary of the regional committee in charge of the region's industrial development. In 1976, the [[Politburo of the CPSU]] promoted him to the post of the First Secretary of the CPSU Committee of [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]] (effectively he became the head of one of the most important industrial regions in the USSR); he remained in this position until 1985. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Communist Party membership==
Yeltsin was a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) from 17 March 1961&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; to 13 July 1990,&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. p. 740.&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''[[nomenklatura]]'' member from 1968.

In 1977, as a party official in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]], Yeltsin was ordered by Moscow to destroy the [[Ipatiev House]] where the [[Nicholas II of Russia|last Russian tsar]] and his family [[Execution of the Romanov family|had been killed]] by [[Bolshevik]] troops. The Ipatiev House was demolished in one night on 27 July 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchfoundationinc.org/Chronology.html |title=Chronology |publisher=Searchfoundation |accessdate=3 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119160700/http://www.searchfoundationinc.org/Chronology.html |archivedate=19 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during Yeltsin's time in Sverdlovsk, a CPSU palace was built which was named "White Tooth" by the residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.ru/works/oe/yeltsine.html|title=Yeltsin Boris Nikolayevich|publisher=Panorama|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Yeltsin developed connections with key people in the Soviet power structure. In January 1981 Yeltsin was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]], the Soviet Union's highest medal, for "the service to the Communist Party and the Soviet State and in connection with the 50th birthday".&lt;ref name="Leon Aron 2000. page 739"/&gt; In March 1981 Yeltsin was elected as a full member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Leon Aron 2000. page 739"/&gt;

==Moscow==
On 11 March 1985, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] was elected General Secretary of the CPSU by the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] after the death of [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. Gorbachev's primary goal was to revive the [[Soviet economy]]; however, he came to believe that fixing the Soviet economy would be nearly impossible without reforming the political and social structure of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/ussr/ussr_state/gorbachev.php|title=Михаил Сергеевич Горбачёв (Mikhail Sergeyevič Gorbačëv)|accessdate=3 April 2009|date=27 March 2009|publisher=Archontology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; To begin implementation of these reforms, he immediately began gathering a younger and more energetic governing team of Communist Party members in [[Moscow]]. On 4 April 1985, Yeltsin received a call from Gorbachev's leading protege [[Yegor Ligachev]] summoning him to Moscow to take up position as Head of the Construction Department of the Party's Central Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. page 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than three months later, he was promoted to be Secretary for Construction of the Central Committee, a position within the powerful [[Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Central Committee Secretariat]].&lt;ref name="Leon Aron 2000. page 739"/&gt;

On 23 December 1985, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] appointed Yeltsin as First Secretary of the [[Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Moscow City Committee]], effectively "Mayor" of the Soviet capital, and as a result, on 18 February 1986, Yeltsin was invited to become a Candidate (non-voting) Member of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]].&lt;!-- ref name="StrangeDeath77"&gt;''The Strange Death of the Soviet Empire'', page 77; ISBN 0-8050-4154-0&lt;/ref --&gt; As a politburo member, Yeltsin was also given a country house ([[dacha]]) which was previously occupied by Gorbachev, who now moved to a much bigger and more luxurious purpose-built dacha nearby. During this period, Yeltsin portrayed himself as a reformer and a [[Populism|populist]] (for example, he took a [[trolleybus]] to work), firing and reshuffling his staff several times. He became popular among Moscow residents for firing corrupt Moscow party officials.

==Resignation==
On 10 September 1987, after a lecture from hard-liner [[Yegor Ligachev]] at the Politburo for allowing two small unsanctioned demonstrations on Moscow streets, Yeltsin wrote a letter of resignation to Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea.&lt;ref name="oclery"&gt;Conor O'Clery, ''Moscow 25 December 1991: The Last Day of the Soviet Union''. pgs 71, 74, 81. Transworld Ireland (2011); {{ISBN|978-1-84827-112-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Gorbachev received the letter he was stunned – nobody in Soviet history had voluntarily resigned from the ranks of the Politburo. Gorbachev phoned Yeltsin and asked him to reconsider.

On 27 October 1987 at the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]], Yeltsin, frustrated that Gorbachev had not addressed any of the issues outlined in his resignation letter asked to speak. He expressed his discontent with both the slow pace of reform in society, the servility shown to the general secretary, and opposition to him from Ligachev making his position untenable, before requesting to resign from the Politburo, adding that the City Committee would decide whether he should resign from the post of [[First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="oclery"/&gt; Aside from the fact that no one had ever before quit the Politburo, no one in the party had ever addressed a leader of the party in such a manner in front of the Central Committee since [[Leon Trotsky]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="oclery"/&gt; In his reply, Gorbachev accused Yeltsin of "political immaturity" and "absolute irresponsibility". Nobody in the Central Committee backed Yeltsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gorbachev Accuses Former Ally of Putting Ambition Above Party|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/13/world/gorbachev-accuses-former-ally-of-putting-ambition-above-party.html|website=NYtimes|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RIAN archive 37106 Boris Yeltsin and Raisa Gorbachev.jpg|thumb|right|196px|Yeltsin with [[Raisa Gorbachova|Raisa Gorbacheva]]]]
Within days, news of Yeltsin's actions leaked and rumours of his "secret speech" at the Central Committee spread throughout Moscow. Soon fabricated ''[[samizdat]]'' versions began to circulate – this was the beginning of Yeltsin's rise as a rebel and growth in popularity as an anti-establishment figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/world/critic-of-gorbachev-offers-to-resign-his-moscow-party-post.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Yeltsin&amp;st=nyt|work=The New York Times|first=Bill|last=Keller|title=CRITIC OF GORBACHEV OFFERS TO RESIGN HIS MOSCOW PARTY POST|date=1 November 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorbachev called a meeting of the Moscow City Party Committee for 11 November 1987 to launch another crushing attack on Yeltsin and confirm his dismissal. On 9 November 1987, Yeltsin apparently tried to kill himself and was rushed to hospital bleeding profusely from self-inflicted cuts to his chest. Gorbachev ordered the injured Yeltsin from his hospital bed to the Moscow party plenum two days later where he was ritually denounced by the party faithful in what was reminiscent of a [[Stalinist show trial]] before he was fired from the post of [[First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party]]. Yeltsin said he would never forgive Gorbachev for this "immoral and inhuman" treatment.&lt;ref name="oclery"/&gt;

Yeltsin was demoted to the position of First Deputy Commissioner for the [[State Committee for Construction]]. At the next meeting of the Central Committee on 24 February 1988, Yeltsin was removed from his position as a Candidate member of the Politburo. He was perturbed and humiliated but began plotting his revenge.&lt;ref name="StrangeDeath86"&gt;''The Strange Death of the Soviet Empire'', p. 86; {{ISBN|0-8050-4154-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His opportunity came with Gorbachev's establishment of the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]].&lt;ref name="StrangeDeath90"&gt;''The Strange Death of the Soviet Empire'', p. 90; {{ISBN|0-8050-4154-0}}&lt;!-- author's name? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He recovered, and started intensively criticizing Gorbachev, highlighting the slow pace of reform in the Soviet Union as his major argument.

Yeltsin's criticism of the Politburo and Gorbachev led to a smear campaign against him, in which examples of Yeltsin's awkward behavior were used against him. Speaking at the CPSU conference in 1988, Yegor Ligachev stated: "[[Boris, you are wrong]]". An article in ''[[Pravda]]'' described Yeltsin as drunk at a lecture during his September 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6yfUkxkQWI|title=Boris Yeltsin Visits Johns Hopkins – 1989|date=12 January 2011|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; visit to the United States, an allegation which appeared to be confirmed by a TV account of his speech. However, popular dissatisfaction with the regime was very strong, and these attempts to smear Yeltsin only added to his popularity. In another incident, Yeltsin fell from a bridge. Commenting on this event, Yeltsin hinted that he was helped to fall from the bridge by the enemies of [[perestroika]], but his opponents suggested that he was simply drunk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=60792 В России появились запретные темы] // [[Коммерсантъ]], № 186 (409), 29 сентября 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 1989, Yeltsin [[Soviet Union legislative election, 1989|was elected]] to the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union]] as the delegate from Moscow district with a decisive 92% of the vote&lt;ref name="Leon Aron 2000. page 739"/&gt; and on 29 May 1989, was elected by the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] to a seat on the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]. On 19 July 1989, Yeltsin announced the formation of the radical pro-reform faction in the Congress of People's Deputies: the [[Inter-Regional Group]] of Deputies, and on 29 July 1989 was elected one of the five co-Chairman of the Inter-Regional Group.&lt;ref name="Leon Aron 2000. page 739"/&gt;

On 16 September 1989, Yeltsin toured a medium-sized grocery store ([[Randall's Food Markets|Randall's]]) in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chron.com/neighborhood/bayarea/news/article/When-Boris-Yeltsin-went-grocery-shopping-in-Clear-5759129.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430073303/https://www.chron.com/neighborhood/bayarea/news/article/When-Boris-Yeltsin-went-grocery-shopping-in-Clear-5759129.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 April 2018|title=When Boris Yeltsin went grocery shopping in Clear Lake|work=Houston Chronicle|access-date=30 April 2018|date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leon Aron, quoting a Yeltsin associate, wrote in his 2000 biography, ''Yeltsin, A Revolutionary Life'' (St. Martin's Press): "For a long time, on the plane to Miami, he sat motionless, his head in his hands. 'What have they done to our poor people?' he said after a long silence." He added, "On his return to Moscow, Yeltsin would confess the pain he had felt after the Houston excursion: the ‘pain for all of us, for our country so rich, so talented and so exhausted by incessant experiments.’”

He wrote that Mr. Yeltsin added, “I think we have committed a crime against our people by making their standard of living so incomparably lower than that of the Americans.” An aide, Lev Sukhanov was reported to have said that it was at that moment that “the last vestige of Bolshevism collapsed” inside his boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/23/world/europe/23cnd-yeltsin.html|title=Boris Yeltsin, Russia’s First Post-Soviet Leader, Is Dead|date=23 April 2007|work=The New York Times|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his autobiography titled ''Against The Grain: An Autobiography'' written and published in 1990, however, Yeltsin hinted in a small passage that after his tour, he made plans on opening his own line of grocery stores and planned to fill it with government subsidized goods in order to alleviate the countries problems.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic==
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2017}}

On 4 March 1990, Yeltsin was elected to the [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia]] representing Sverdlovsk with 72% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. page 739-740.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 1990, he was elected chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR|Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR), in spite of the fact that Gorbachev personally pleaded with the Russian deputies not to select Yeltsin.&lt;ref name=dob30may&gt;{{cite news|last=Dobbs|first=Michael|title=Yeltsin Wins Presidency of Russia|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/russiagov/stories/pres053090.htm|accessdate=31 March 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=30 May 1990|location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was supported by both democratic and conservative members of the Supreme Soviet, which sought power in the developing political situation in the country.

A part of this power struggle was the opposition between power structures of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]]. In an attempt to gain more power, on 12 June 1990, the Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR adopted a declaration of sovereignty. On 12 July 1990, Yeltsin resigned from the CPSU in a dramatic speech before party members at the [[28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], some of whom responded by shouting "Shame!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/12/newsid_4493000/4493177.stm|newspaper=BBC|title=1990: Yeltsin resignation splits Soviet Communists|date=12 July 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991 presidential election===
{{Main article|Boris Yeltsin presidential campaign, 1991}}

On 12 June 1991, Yeltsin won 57% of the popular vote in the democratic [[Russian presidential election, 1991|presidential elections for the Russian republic]], defeating Gorbachev's preferred candidate, [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], who got just 16% of the vote, and four other candidates. In his election campaign, Yeltsin criticized the "dictatorship of the center", but did not suggest the introduction of a market economy. Instead, he said that he would put his head on the railtrack in the event of increased prices. Yeltsin took office on 10 July, and reappointed [[Ivan Silayev]] as [[List of heads of government of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Council of Ministers – Government]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]].
On 18 August 1991, a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup against Gorbachev]] was launched by the government members opposed to perestroika. Gorbachev was held in [[Crimea]] while Yeltsin raced to the [[White House of Russia]] (residence of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR) in Moscow to defy the coup, making a memorable speech from atop the turret of a tank onto which he had climbed. The White House was surrounded by the military but the troops defected in the face of mass popular demonstrations. By 21 August most of the coup leaders had fled Moscow and Gorbachev was "rescued" from [[Crimea]] and then returned to Moscow. Yeltsin was subsequently hailed by his supporters around the world for rallying mass opposition to the coup.
[[File:Boris Yeltsin 22 August 1991-1.jpg|thumb|left|Yeltsin on 22 August 1991]]
Although restored to his position, Gorbachev had been destroyed politically. Neither union nor Russian power structures heeded his commands as support had swung over to Yeltsin.  Taking advantage of the situation, Yeltsin began taking what remained of the Soviet government, ministry by ministry—including the Kremlin. On 6 November 1991, Yeltsin issued a decree banning all Communist Party activities on Russian soil. In early December 1991, Ukraine voted for independence from the Soviet Union. A week later, on 8 December, Yeltsin met Ukrainian president [[Leonid Kravchuk]] and the leader of Belarus, [[Stanislav Shushkevich]], in [[Belovezhskaya Pushcha]]. In the [[Belavezha Accords]], the three presidents announced the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] and the formation of a voluntary [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) in its place.&lt;ref&gt;Прайс М.

[[File:RIAN archive 848095 Signing the Agreement to eliminate the USSR and establish the Commonwealth of Independent States.jpg|thumb|[[Republics of the Soviet Union|Leaders of the Soviet Republics]] sign the [[Belovezha Accords]] which eliminated the USSR]]
According to Gorbachev, Yeltsin kept the plans of the Belovezhskaya meeting in strict secrecy and the main goal of the dissolution of the Soviet Union was to get rid of Gorbachev, who by that time had started to recover his position after the events of August. Gorbachev has also accused Yeltsin of violating the people's will expressed in the referendum in which the majority voted to keep the Soviet Union united. On 12 December, the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR ratified the Belavezha Accords and denounced the 1922 [[Union Treaty]]. It also ordered the Russian deputies in the [[Soviet of the Union|Council of the Union]] to cease their work, leaving that body without a quorum. In effect, the largest republic of the Soviet Union had seceded.

On 17 December, in a meeting with Yeltsin, Gorbachev accepted the ''fait accompli'' and agreed to dissolve the Soviet Union. On 24 December, the Russian Federation, by mutual agreement of the other CIS states (which by this time included all of the remaining republics except Georgia) took the Soviet Union's seat in the United Nations. The next day, Gorbachev resigned and [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union ceased to exist]]—thereby ending the world's oldest, largest and most powerful Communist state. Economic relations between the former Soviet republics were severely compromised. Millions of ethnic Russians found themselves in the newly formed foreign countries.&lt;ref name="apn.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apn.ru/publications/article16977.htm|title=Исполнитель.

====Radical reforms====
Just days after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Boris Yeltsin resolved to embark on a programme of radical economic reform. Unlike Gorbachev's reforms, which sought to expand democracy in the socialist system, the new regime aimed to completely dismantle socialism and fully implement capitalism; converting the world's largest command economy into a free-market one. During early discussions of this transition, Yeltsin's advisers debated issues of speed and sequencing, with an apparent division between those favouring a rapid approach and those favoring a gradual or slower approach.

On 2 January 1992, Yeltsin, acting as his own [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]], ordered the liberalisation of [[foreign trade]], [[prices control|price]]s, and currency. At the same time, Yeltsin followed a policy of "macroeconomic stabilisation", a harsh austerity regime designed to control inflation. Under Yeltsin's stabilisation programme, [[interest rate]]s were raised to extremely high levels to tighten [[Russian rouble|money]] and restrict [[credit (finance)|credit]]. To bring state spending and revenues into balance, Yeltsin raised new taxes heavily, cut back sharply on government subsidies to industry and construction, and made steep cuts to state welfare spending.

In early 1992, prices skyrocketed throughout Russia, and a deep credit crunch shut down many industries and brought about a protracted depression. The reforms devastated the living standards of much of the population, especially the groups dependent on Soviet-era state subsidies and [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] entitlement programmes.&lt;ref name="Peter Nolan 1995. pp. 17"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Nolan |title=China's Rise, Russia's Fall |location=London |publisher=Macmillan Press |year=1995 |pages=17–18 |isbn=0-333-62265-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1990s, Russia's GDP fell by 50%, vast sectors of the economy were wiped out, inequality and unemployment grew dramatically, whilst incomes fell.

Some economists argue that in the 1990s, Russia suffered an economic downturn more severe than the [[United States]] or [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] had undergone six decades earlier in the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="Peter Nolan 1995. pp. 17"/&gt; Russian commentators and even some Western economists, such as [[Marshall Goldman]], widely blamed Yeltsin's economic programme for the country's disastrous economic performance in the 1990s. Many politicians began to quickly distance themselves from the programme. In February 1992, Russia's vice president, [[Alexander Rutskoy]] denounced the Yeltsin programme as "economic genocide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Celestine |last=Bohlen |title=Yeltsin Deputy Calls Reforms 'Economic Genocide' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 February 1992 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/09/world/yeltsin-deputy-calls-reforms-economic-genocide.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993, conflict over the reform direction escalated between Yeltsin on the one side, and the opposition to radical economic reform in Russia's parliament on the other.

====Confrontation with parliament====
{{Main|1993 Russian constitutional crisis}}
Also throughout 1992, Yeltsin wrestled with the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] and the Congress of People's Deputies for control over government, government policy, government banking and property. In the course of 1992, the speaker of the Russian Supreme Soviet, [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], came out in opposition to the reforms, despite claiming to support Yeltsin's overall goals. In December 1992, the 7th Congress of People's Deputies succeeded in turning down the Yeltsin-backed candidacy of Yegor Gaidar for the position of [[Prime Minister of Russia|Russian Prime Minister]]. An agreement was brokered by [[Valery Zorkin]], chairman of the Constitutional Court, which included the following provisions: a national referendum on the new constitution; parliament and Yeltsin would choose a new head of government, to be confirmed by the Supreme Soviet; and the parliament was to cease making constitutional amendments that change the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches. Eventually, on 14 December, [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]], widely seen as a compromise figure, was confirmed in the office.

The conflict escalated soon, however, with the parliament changing its prior decision to hold a referendum. Yeltsin, in turn, announced in a televised address to the nation on 20 March 1993, that he was going to assume certain "special powers" in order to implement his programme of reforms. In response, the hastily called 9th Congress of People's Deputies attempted to remove Yeltsin from presidency through [[Impeachment in Russia|impeachment]] on 26 March 1993. Yeltsin's opponents gathered more than 600 votes for impeachment, but fell 72 votes short of the required two-thirds majority.&lt;ref name="nationel"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/yeltsin-father-democracy/|title=Yeltsin–Father of Democracy?|last=vanden Heuvel|first=Katrina|date=2007|website=|publisher=The Nation|ssrn=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127223356/https://www.thenation.com/article/yeltsin-father-democracy/|archive-date=2017-01-27|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:President Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin sign the Start II Treaty at a Ceremony in Vladimir Hall, The... - NARA - 186462.tif|thumb|Yeltsin during the signature ceremony of the [[START II]] in [[Moscow]], January 1993]]
During the summer of 1993, a situation of [[dual power]] developed in Russia. Since July, two separate administrations of the [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]] functioned side by side, after Yeltsin refused to accept the newly elected pro-parliament head of the region. The Supreme Soviet pursued its own foreign policies, passing a declaration on the status of [[Sevastopol]]. In August, a commentator reflected on the situation as follows: "The President issues decrees as if there were no Supreme Soviet, and the Supreme Soviet suspends decrees as if there were no President." ([[Izvestiya]], 13 August 1993).&lt;ref&gt;Executive decree authority, by John M. Carey &amp; Matthew Soberg, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2k9iI91GVt4C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=yeltsin+decree+1400+1993&amp;ei=tZG3Sa3RGZaQyAST9rnXBA p. 76]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 1993, Yeltsin, in breach of the constitution; announced in a televised address his decision to disband the Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies by decree. In his address, Yeltsin declared his intent to rule by decree until the election of the new parliament and a referendum on a new constitution, triggering the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993|constitutional crisis of October 1993]]. On the night after Yeltsin's televised address, the Supreme Soviet declared Yeltsin removed from presidency, by virtue of him having breached the constitution, and Vice-President [[Alexander Rutskoy]] was sworn in as acting president.&lt;ref name="nationel"/&gt;

Between 21 and 24 September, Yeltsin was confronted by popular unrest. The demonstrators were protesting the new and terrible living conditions under Yeltsin. Since 1989, GDP had declined by half. Corruption was rampant, violent crime was skyrocketing, medical services were collapsing, food and fuel were increasingly scarce and life expectancy was falling for all but a tiny handful of the population; moreover, Yeltsin was increasingly getting the blame. By early-October, Yeltsin had secured the support of Russia's army and ministry of interior forces. In a massive show of force, Yeltsin called up tanks to shell the [[Russian White House]], Russian parliament building.&lt;ref name="nationel"/&gt;

As the Supreme Soviet was dissolved, elections to the newly established parliament, the [[State Duma]], were held in December 1993. Candidates associated with Yeltsin's economic policies were overwhelmed by a huge anti-Yeltsin vote, the bulk of which was divided between the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]] and ultra-nationalists. The referendum, however, held at the same time, approved the new constitution, which significantly expanded the powers of the president, giving Yeltsin a right to appoint the members of the government, to dismiss the [[Prime Minister]] and, in some cases, to dissolve the Duma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/ch4.html |title=Russian Constitution SECTION ONE Chapter 4 |publisher=Departments.bucknell.edu |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chechnya====
{{Main|First Chechen War}}
In December 1994, Yeltsin ordered the military invasion of [[Chechnya]] in an attempt to restore Moscow's control over the republic. Nearly two years later, Yeltsin withdrew federal forces from the devastated Chechnya under a 1996 peace agreement brokered by [[Alexander Lebed]]; Yeltsin's then-security chief. The peace deal allowed Chechnya greater autonomy but not full independence. The decision to launch the war in Chechnya dismayed many in the West. [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then, what was to be made of Boris Yeltsin? Clearly he could no longer be regarded as the democratic hero of Western myth. But had he become an old-style communist boss, turning his back on the democratic reformers he once championed and throwing in his lot with militarists and ultranationalists? Or was he a befuddled, out-of-touch chief being manipulated, knowingly or unwittingly, by—well, by whom exactly? If there was to be a dictatorial coup, would Yeltsin be its victim or its leader?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982323-1,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=Death Trap |date=16 January 1995 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Privatization and the rise of "the oligarchs"====
{{Main|Privatization in Russia}}
[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumb|right|Yeltsin and [[Bill Clinton]] share a laugh in October 1995]]
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yeltsin promoted [[privatization in Russia|privatisation]] as a way of spreading ownership of shares in former state enterprises as widely as possible to create political support for his economic reforms. In the West, privatisation was viewed as the key to the transition from Communism in Eastern Europe, ensuring a quick dismantling of the Soviet-era command economy to make way for "free market reforms". In the early-1990s, [[Anatoly Chubais]], Yeltsin's deputy for economic policy, emerged as a leading advocate of privatisation in Russia.

In late 1992, Yeltsin launched a programme of free vouchers as a way to give mass privatisation a jump-start. Under the programme, all Russian citizens were issued vouchers, each with a nominal value of around 10,000 roubles, for the purchase of shares of select state enterprises. Although each citizen initially received a voucher of equal face value, within months the majority of them converged in the hands of intermediaries who were ready to buy them for cash right away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sps.ru/?id=234112 |title=Олег Наумов, Андрей Нечаев: Пройдет время, и в школьных учебниках истории о Борисе Ельцине будет записано, что это президент, заложивший основы новой демократической России |access-date=8 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109100134/http://www.sps.ru/?id=234112 |archive-date=9 January 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, as Yeltsin struggled to finance Russia's growing foreign debt and gain support from the Russian business elite for his bid in the 1996 presidential elections, the Russian president prepared for a new wave of privatisation offering stock shares in some of Russia's most valuable state enterprises in exchange for bank loans. The programme was promoted as a way of simultaneously speeding up privatisation and ensuring the government a cash infusion to cover its operating needs.'&lt;ref name="apn.ru"/&gt;

However, the deals were effectively giveaways of valuable state assets to a small group of tycoons in finance, industry, energy, telecommunications, and the media who came to be known as "[[Business oligarch|oligarchs]]" in the mid-1990s. This was due to the fact that ordinary people sold their vouchers for cash. The vouchers were bought out by a small group of investors. By mid-1996, substantial ownership shares over major firms were acquired at very low prices by a handful of people. [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], who controlled major stakes in several banks and the national media, emerged as one of Yeltsin's most prominent supporters. Along with Berezovsky, [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], [[Vladimir Potanin]], [[Vladimir Bogdanov]], [[Rem Viakhirev]], [[Vagit Alekperov]], [[Alexander Smolensky]], [[Victor Vekselberg]], [[Mikhail Fridman]] and a few years later [[Roman Abramovich]], were habitually mentioned in the media as [[Russia's oligarchs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://izvestia.ru/news/397903|title=Двойник Ельцина выразил соболезнования|work=Известия|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Korean Air Lines Flight 007====
{{Main|Korean Air Lines Flight 007}}
On 5 December 1991, [[Jesse Helms|Senator Jesse Helms]], ranking member of the Minority on the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, wrote to Yeltsin concerning U.S. servicemen who were POWs or MIAs. "The status of thousands and thousands of American servicemen who are held by Soviet and other Communist forces, and who were never repatriated after every major war this century, is of grave concern to the American people."&lt;ref name="Moscow Bound 1993"&gt;Moscow Bound: Policy, Politics, and the POW/MIA Dilemma, John M. G. Brown, Veteran Press, Eureka Springs, California, US (1993), Chapter 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeltsin would ultimately respond with a statement made on 15 June 1992, whilst being interviewed onboard his presidential jet en route to the United States, "Our archives have shown that it is true&amp;nbsp;— some of them were transferred to the territory of the USSR and were kept in labour camps... We can only surmise that some of them may still be alive."&lt;ref name="Moscow Bound 1993"/&gt; On 10 December 1991, just five days after Senator Helms had written to Yeltsin regarding American servicemen, he again wrote to Yeltsin, this time concerning [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] (KAL 007) requesting information concerning possible survivors, including Georgia Congressman [[Larry McDonald]], and their whereabouts.

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the greatest tragedies of the Cold War was the shoot-down of the Korean Airlines Flight 007 by the Armed Forces of what was then the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983... The KAL-007 tragedy was one of the most tense incidences of the entire Cold War. However, now that relations between our two nations have improved substantially, I believe that it is time to resolve the mysteries surrounding this event. Clearing the air on this issue could help further to improve relations.
:— Sen. Jesse Helms, writing to Yeltsin, 10 December 1991.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 1992, Yeltsin would hand over KAL 007's black box without its tapes to South Korean President [[Roh Tae-Woo]] at the end of the plenary session of the Korean National Assembly with this statement, "We apologise for the tragedy and are trying to settle some unsolved issues." Yeltsin released the tapes of the KAL 007's "Black Box" (its [[Digital data|Digital]] [[Flight Data Recorder]] and [[Cockpit Voice Recorder]]) to the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) on 8 January 1993.&lt;ref&gt;ICAO State Letter LE 4/19.4 – 93/68 (Summary of Findings and Conclusions)&lt;/ref&gt; For years the Soviet authorities had denied possessing these tapes. The openness of Yeltsin about POW/MIA and KAL 007 matters may also have signalled his willingness for more openness to the West. In 1992, which he labelled the "window of opportunity", he was willing to discuss biological weapons with the United States and admitted that the [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak]] of 2 April 1979 (which Yeltsin had originally been involved in concealing) had been caused as the result of a mishap at a military facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Evans|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB61|title=Anthrax at Sverdlovsk, 1979|publisher=Gwu.edu|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.

[[File:Red belt in Russian 1996 presidential elections.svg|thumb|left|The results of the second round of the 1996 elections. Grey highlighted regions where Yeltsin won]]
In February 1996, Yeltsin announced that he would seek a second term at the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|1996 Russian presidential election]] in the summer. The announcement followed weeks of speculation that Yeltsin was at the end of his political career because of his health problems and growing unpopularity in Russia. At the time, Yeltsin was recuperating from a series of heart attacks. Domestic and international observers also noted his occasionally erratic behaviour. When campaigning began in early 1996, Yeltsin's popularity was close to being non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/pivotal.elections/1996/russia/candidate.html CNN, Russian presidential candidate profiles, 1906]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310043516/http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/pivotal.elections/1996/russia/candidate.html |date=10 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the opposition [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]] had already gained ground in parliamentary voting on 17 December 1995, and its candidate, [[Gennady Zyuganov]], had a strong grassroots organisation, especially in the rural areas and small towns, and appealed effectively to memories of the old days of Soviet prestige on the international stage and the domestic order under state socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9602/russia_zyuganov|title=Gennady Zyuganov candidate profile, 1996|publisher=CNN|date=7 February 1996|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panic struck the Yeltsin team when opinion polls suggested that the ailing president could not win; some members of his entourage urged him to cancel the presidential elections and effectively rule as a dictator from then on.&lt;ref name="wsj240407"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/article/SB117736605879579568-search.html?KEYWORDS=russia&amp;COLLECTION=wsjie/6month Россия Ельцина]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417215945/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117736605879579568-search.html?KEYWORDS=russia&amp;COLLECTION=wsjie%2F6month |date=17 April 2012  }} // The Wall Street Journal, 24 апреля 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Yeltsin changed his campaign team, assigning a key role to his daughter, [[Tatyana Dyachenko]], and appointing Chubais as campaign manager. Chubais, acting as both Yeltsin's campaign manager and adviser on Russia's privatisation programme, used his control of the privatisation programme as an instrument of Yeltsin's re-election campaign.

In mid-1996, Chubais and Yeltsin recruited a team of a handful of financial and media oligarchs to bankroll the Yeltsin campaign and guaranteed favourable media coverage to the president on national television and in leading newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Treisman, "Blaming Russia First", ''Foreign Affairs'', November/December 2000. {{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20001101fareviewessay946/daniel-treisman/blaming-russia-first.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 July 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803112056/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20001101fareviewessay946/daniel-treisman/blaming-russia-first.html |archivedate=3 August 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Chubais allowed well-connected Russian business leaders to acquire majority stakes in some of Russia's most valuable state-owned assets.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite journal |first=Pekka |last=Sutela |title=Insider Privatization in Russia: Speculations on Systemic Changes |journal=Europe-Asia Studies |volume=46 |issue=3 |year=1994 |pages=420–21 |doi=10.1080/09668139408412171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by the efforts of [[Mikhail Lesin]], the media painted a picture of a fateful choice for Russia, between Yeltsin and a "return to totalitarianism." The oligarchs even played up the threat of civil war if a Communist was elected president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inosmi.ru/text/stories/07/04/24/3509/234270.html Борис-боец]{{dead link|date=April 2016}} // [[The New York Times]], 30 апреля 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeltsin campaigned energetically, dispelling concerns about his health, and maintained a high media profile. To boost his popularity, Yeltsin promised to abandon some of his more unpopular economic reforms, boost welfare spending, end the war in Chechnya, and pay wage and pension arrears. Yeltsin had benefited from the approval of a US$10.2 billion [[International Monetary Fund]] loan to Russia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/23/world/russia-and-imf-agree-on-a-loan-for-10.2-billion.html|title=The New York Times: RUSSIA AND I.M.F.

[[File:PreobrazhenskaiaPloshad96.JPG|thumb|Yeltsin presidential campaign]]
Zyuganov, who lacked Yeltsin's resources and financial backing, saw his strong initial lead whittled away. After the first round on 16 June, Yeltsin appointed a highly popular candidate [[Alexander Lebed]], who finished in third place in the first round, Secretary of the [[Security Council of Russia]], sacked at the latter's behest defence minister [[Pavel Grachev]] and on 20 June sacked a number of his ''[[siloviki]]'', one of them being his chief of presidential security [[Alexander Korzhakov]], viewed by many as Yeltsin's [[éminence grise]]. In the run-off on 3 July, with a turnout of 68.9%, Yeltsin won 53.8% of the vote and Zyuganov 40.3%, with the rest (5.9%) voting "[[blank vote|against all]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/russiagov/stories/premier070596.htm|title=Lee Hockstader, Washington Post Foreign Service|work=The Washington Post|date=5 July 1996|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeltsin underwent emergency [[Coronary artery bypass surgery#Number of bypasses|quintuple heart bypass surgery]] in November 1996, and remained in the hospital for months. During his presidency, Russia received US$40,000,000,000 in funds from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and other international lending organisations. However, his opponents allege that most of these funds were stolen by people from Yeltsin's circle and placed into foreign banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/articles/?a=1999/7/26/125259|title=Where Is the IMF Money to Russia Really Going?|author=Stanislav Lunev|publisher=[[NewsMax.com]]|date=27 July 1999|accessdate=17 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829105751/http://www.newsmax.com/articles/?a=1999%2F7%2F26%2F125259|archive-date=29 August 2005|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-spark.net/csart264.html|title=Yeltsin, "The Family" and the Bureaucratic Mafia|author=the-spark.net|date=19 July 2003|accessdate=17 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/c-asia/AI11Ag01.html|title=Checkmate nears for Yeltsin|work=[[Asia Times]]|date=10 September 1999|accessdate=17 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a political and economic crisis emerged when Yeltsin's government defaulted on its debts, causing financial markets to panic and the [[Russian ruble|rouble]] to collapse in the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]]. During the 1999 [[Kosovo war]], Yeltsin strongly opposed the [[NATO]] military campaign against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and warned of possible Russian intervention if NATO deployed ground troops to Kosovo. In televised comments he stated: "I told NATO, the Americans, the Germans: Don't push us towards military action. Otherwise there will be a European war for sure and possibly a world war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yeltsin Warns of European War Over Kosovo|agency=Reuters|date=9 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yeltsin warns of possible world war over Kosovo|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9904/09/kosovo.diplomacy.02|publisher=CNN|date=9 April 1999|accessdate=23 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 1999, Yeltsin fired his Prime Minister, [[Sergei Stepashin]], and for the fourth time, fired his entire Cabinet. In Stepashin's place, he appointed [[Vladimir Putin]], relatively unknown at that time, and announced his wish to see Putin as his successor. In late 1999, Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton openly disagreed on the war in Chechnya. At the November meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Clinton pointed his finger at Yeltsin and demanded he halt bombing attacks that had resulted in many civilian casualties. Yeltsin immediately left the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Charles Babington|title=Clinton Spars With Yeltsin on Chechnya, President Denounces Killing of Civilians|work=The Washington Post|date=19 November 1999|page=A01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vladimir Putin with Boris Yeltsin-5.jpg|thumb|right|Yeltsin with [[Patriarch Alexy II]] and Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]]]]
In December, whilst visiting China to seek support on Chechnya, Yeltsin replied to Clinton's criticism of a Russian ultimatum to citizens of Grozny. He bluntly pronounced: "Yesterday, Clinton permitted himself to put pressure on Russia. It seems he has for a minute, for a second, for half a minute, forgotten that Russia has a full arsenal of nuclear weapons. He has forgotten about that." Clinton dismissed Yeltsin's comments stating: ''"I didn't think he'd forgotten that America was a great power when he disagreed with what I did in Kosovo."'' It fell to Putin to downplay Yeltsin's comments and present reassurances about U.S. and Russian relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Laris|title=In China, Yeltsin Lashes Out at Clinton Criticisms of Chechen War Are Met With Blunt Reminder of Russian Nuclear Power|work=The Washington Post |page=A35|date=10 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempted 1999 impeachment====
On 15 May 1999, Yeltsin survived another attempt of impeachment, this time by the [[Democracy|democratic]] and [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|communist]] opposition in the [[State Duma]]. He was charged with several unconstitutional activities, including the signing of the [[Belavezha Accords]] dissolving the [[Soviet Union]] in December 1991, the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|coup-d'état in October 1993]], and initiating the [[First Chechen War|war]] in [[Chechnya]] in 1994. None of these charges received the two-thirds majority of the Duma which was required to initiate the process of [[impeachment]] of the president.

====Mabetex corruption====

With [[Pavel Borodin]] as the Kremlin property manager, Swiss construction firm [[Mabetex]] was awarded many important Russian government contracts. They were awarded the contracts to reconstruct, renovate and refurbish the former [[White House, Moscow|Russian Federation Parliament]], the Russian Opera House, [[State Duma]] and the [[Moscow Kremlin]].
[[File:Boris Yeltsin 31 December 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Yeltsin on the day of his resignation, together with Putin and [[Alexander Voloshin]]]]
In 1998, Prosecutor General of Russia [[Yuri Skuratov]] opened a bribery investigation against Mabetex, accusing [[Mabetex]] CEO Mr. Pacolli of bribing President Boris Yeltsin and his family members. Swiss authorities issued an international arrest warrant for Pavel Borodin, the official who managed the Kremlin's property empire.&lt;ref name="guardian2" /&gt;  Admitting publicly that bribery was usual business practice in Russia, Mr. Pacolli confirmed in early-December 1999 that he had guaranteed five credit cards for Mr. Yeltsin's wife, Naina, and two daughters, Tatyana and Yelena.&lt;ref name="guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/28/russia.iantraynor|title=Swiss investigators order arrest of top Yeltsin aide|author=Ian Traynor, Peter Capella|date=February 2000|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher=guardian.co.uk|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Yeltsin resigned a few weeks later on 31 December 1999, appointing Vladimir Putin as his successor. President Putin's first decree as president was lifelong immunity from prosecution for Mr. Yeltsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transcripts of 'Insight' on CNN|publisher=CNN|date=7 October 2002|accessdate=17 July 2007|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0210/07/i_ins.01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resignation====

On 31 December 1999, in an announcement aired at 12:00&amp;nbsp;pm MSK on Russian television and taped in the morning of the same day, Yeltsin said he had resigned and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin had taken over as acting president, with elections due to take place on 26 March 2000. Yeltsin asked for forgiveness for what he acknowledged were errors of his rule, and said Russia needed to enter the new century with new political leaders. Yeltsin said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to ask for your forgiveness, that many of our dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I felt in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yeltsin's Resignation Speech|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6584973.stm|website=www.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By some estimates, his approval ratings when leaving office were as low as 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transcripts of 'Insight' on CNN|publisher=CNN|date=7 October 2002|accessdate=17 July 2007|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0210/07/i_ins.01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeltsin suffered from heart disease during his first term as President of the Russian Federation, probably continuing for the rest of his life. He is known to have suffered heart problems in March 1990, just after being elected as a member of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/08/98/russia_crisis/202193.stm|title=BBC News – Russia crisis – Yeltsin's health record|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was common knowledge that in early 1996 he was recuperating from a series of heart attacks and, soon after, he spent months in hospital recovering from a quintuple bypass operation (see above). His death in 2007 was recorded as due to congestive heart failure.
[[File:Boris Yeltsin 24 September 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Boris Yeltsin with tennis player Dmitry Tursunov in 2006]]
According to numerous reports, Yeltsin was alcohol dependent. The subject made headlines abroad during Yeltsin's visit to the U.S. in 1989 for a series of lectures on social and political life in the Soviet Union. A report in the Italian newspaper ''[[La Repubblica]]'', reprinted by ''[[Pravda]]'', reported that Yeltsin often appeared drunk in public. His alleged alcoholism was also the subject of media discussion following his meeting with U.S. [[Deputy Secretary of State]] [[Strobe Talbott]] following Clinton's inauguration in 1993 and [[Boris Yeltsin circling over Shannon diplomatic incident|an incident]] during a flight stop-over at [[Shannon Airport]], Ireland, in September 1994 when the waiting Irish prime minister [[Albert Reynolds]] was told that Yeltsin was unwell and would not be leaving the aircraft. Reynolds tried to make excuses for him in an effort to offset his own humiliation in vainly waiting outside the plane to meet him. Speaking to the media in March 2010, Yeltsin's daughter [[Tatyana Yumasheva]] claimed that her father had suffered a heart attack on the flight from the United States to Moscow and was therefore not in a position to leave the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7052415.ece|accessdate= 7 March 2010|title=The sober truth behind Boris Yeltsin's drinking problem|work=The Times|location=London, UK|date=7 March 2010|author=Mark Franchetti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia [[Boris Nemtsov]], the bizarre behavior of Yeltsin resulted from "strong drugs" given to him by Kremlin doctors, which were incompatible even with a small amount of alcohol. This was discussed by journalist [[Yelena Tregubova]] from the "[[Kremlin pool]]" in connection with an episode during Yeltsin's visit to [[Stockholm]] in 1997 when Yeltsin suddenly started talking nonsense (he allegedly told his bemused audience that Swedish meatballs reminded him of [[Björn Borg]]'s face),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article6849472.ece|work=The Times|location=London, UK|title=Understanding the news this week 26 September 2009|date=25 September 2009|accessdate=26 April 2010|author=Tom Whipple}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/02/17/office-party-the-top-ten-drunk-politicians-115875-21131145|title=Office party: The top ten worse for wear politicians|work=Daily Mirror|location=UK|accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; lost his balance, and almost fell down on the podium after drinking a single glass of champagne.&lt;ref name=digger&gt;[[Yelena Tregubova]] ''Tales of a Kremlin Digger'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Елена Трегубова.

Yeltsin, in his memoirs, claimed no recollection of the event but did make a passing reference to the incident when he met Borg a year later at the World Circle Kabaddi Cup in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], where the pair had been invited to present the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Yeltsin, ''Midnight Diaries'', New York, p. 344&lt;!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He made a hasty withdrawal from the funeral of King [[Hussein of Jordan]] in February 1999.&lt;ref name=digger /&gt;

After Yeltsin's death, a Dutch neurosurgeon, Michiel Staal, said that his team had been secretly flown to Moscow to operate on Yeltsin in 1999. Yeltsin suffered from an unspecified neurological disorder that affected his sense of balance, causing him to wobble as if in a drunken state; the goal of the operation was to reduce the pain {{clarify|what pain?|date=April 2018}}.&lt;ref name=digger /&gt;

According to author and historian [[Taylor Branch]]'s interviews with [[Bill Clinton]], on a 1995 visit to Washington D.C., Yeltsin was found on Pennsylvania Avenue, drunk, in his underwear and trying to hail a taxi cab in order to find pizza.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Page, [https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-09-21-clinton-tapes_N.htm "Secret interviews add insight to Clinton presidency"], ''USA Today'', 21 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeltsin's personal and health problems received a great deal of attention in the global press. As the years went on, he was often viewed as an increasingly drunk and unstable leader, rather than the inspiring figure he was once seen as. The possibility that he might die in office was often discussed. Starting in the last years of his presidential term, Yeltsin's primary residence was the ''Gorki-9'' presidential dacha west of Moscow. He made frequent stays at the nearby government sanatorium in [[Barvikha]].&lt;ref name=digger /&gt;

In October 1999 Yeltsin was hospitalized with flu and a fever, and in the following month he was hospitalized with [[pneumonia]], just days after receiving treatment for [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/542017.stm|title=BBC News – EUROPE – Yeltsin rushed to hospital|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after resignation==
[[File:Boris Yeltsin 1 February 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Yeltsin with his wife [[Naina Yeltsina|Naina]] on his 75th birthday, 2006]]
Yeltsin maintained a low profile after his resignation, making almost no public statements or appearances. He criticized his successor &lt;!-- Putin --&gt;in December 2000 for supporting the reintroduction of the Soviet-era national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1059784.stm|title=BBC News – EUROPE – Yeltsin attacks Putin over anthem|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2001 he was hospitalized for six weeks with [[pneumonia]] resulting from a viral infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1215204.stm|title=BBC News – EUROPE – Yeltsin leaves hospital|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 September 2004, following the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]] and nearly concurrent terrorist attacks in Moscow, Putin launched an initiative to replace the election of regional governors with a system whereby they would be directly appointed by the president and approved by regional legislatures. Yeltsin, together with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], publicly criticized Putin's plan as a step away from democracy in Russia and a return to the centrally-run political apparatus of the Soviet era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/1218131/posts?page=207|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116170033/http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/1218131/posts?page=207|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 January 2017|title=Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin Speak out Against Putin's Reforms|publisher=MosNews.com|date=16 September 2004|accessdate=17 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Constitution permitted us to begin building a truly effective Federation. ... We knew him as a brave and a warm-hearted, spiritual person. He was an upstanding and courageous national leader. And he was always very honest and frank while defending his position. ... [Yeltsin] assumed full responsibility for everything he called for, for everything he aspired to. For everything he tried to do and did do for the sake of Russia, for the sake of millions of Russians. And he invariably took upon himself, let it in his heart, all the trials and tribulations of Russia, peoples' difficulties and problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/04/23/2207_type82912_125079.shtml Vladimir Putin`s Address on the Occasion of Boris Yelstin’s Passing]{{dead link|date=April 2016}} Kremlin, 23 April 2007.

It is based on the concept of association of time ([[prahar]]) with the ragas. 2011 saw the inception of this festival. It usually takes place in the month of September every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/music-for-the-dusk-and-after/999630/|title=Music for the Dusk and After - Indian Express|website=www.indianexpress.com|accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The festival started in 2011 at NCPA, Mumbai. It explores various ragas associated with different times of the day. Singing these ragas at their particular times brings out the most in them.

The '''Chicago Opera House''', was a theater complex in [[Chicago, Illinois]], designed by the architectural firm of [[Cobb and Frost]].&lt;ref name=condit&gt;{{cite book| first=Carl W.| last=Condit| title=The Chicago School of Architecture| publisher=University of Chicago Press| date=15 November 1998|  pages=59–60| isbn=978-0226114552}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago Opera House building took the cue provided by the [[Metropolitan Opera]] of New York as a mixed-used building: it housed both a theater and unrelated offices, used to subsidize the cost of the theater building. The theater itself was located in the middle of the complex and office structures flanked each side.&lt;ref name="condit"/&gt; The entire complex was known as the "Chicago Opera House Block," and was located at the Southwest corner of West Washington Avenue and North Clark Street.

The Chicago Opera House was opened to the public on August 18, 1885. The first performance in the new theater was of ''[[Hamlet]]'' starring  Thomas W. Keene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The New Chicago Opera House| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=August 19, 1885| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1885/08/19/archives/the-new-chicago-opera-house.html| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1887 to 1890, the Chicago Opera House served as the official observation location for recording the climate of the city of Chicago by the [[National Weather Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=History of the Chicago and Rockford weather observation sites| url=http://www.weather.gov/lot/observation_history| publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]| accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater suffered a fire in December 1888, which mainly damaged portions of the roof. However, the roof was repaired, and most of the exterior of the building remained undamaged. During its existence, the Chicago Opera House was the site of the premiere of several successful musicals such as ''[[Sinbad (1891 musical)|Sinbad]]'' and ''[[The Arabian Nights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=A Big Theatre Burning| work=The New York Times| date=December 13, 1888| subscription=yes| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1888/12/13/archives/a-big-theatre-burning-the-chicago-opera-house-threatened-with.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last performance at the building was the stage play ''The Escape'' by Paul Armstrong (later made into a film, now lost, by D.W. Griffith in 1914). Demolition on The Chicago Opera House began May 5, 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The Chicago Opera House Closed| work=[[Chicago Tribune|The Chicago Daily Tribune]]| date=May 4, 1913| page=4, Part 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is currently occupied by the [[Burnham Center]] (formerly known as the Conway Building), completed in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Burnham Center| url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=116837| publisher=[[Emporis]]| accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The idea for the Chicago Opera House came from Scottish-born newspaperman and financier David Henderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1244.html| title=Theater| work=[[The Encyclopedia of Chicago]]| last=Adler| first=Tony| year=2005| isbn=978-0226310152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson "planned the scheme and the stock – 550,000 – was subscribed in six weeks. Thus Chicago had the first fireproof, steel constructed, electric lighted theatre in the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Who's who on the Stage| editor1-first=Walter| editor1-last=Browne| editor2-first=Frederick Arnold| editor2-last=Austin| year=1908| page=232| publisher=B.W. Dodge| location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the Chicago Opera House was one of the earliest examples of [[General contractor|general contracting]], run by [[George A. Fuller]]. Upon completion, the [[masonry]]-clad building was 10 stories and {{convert|140|ft|m}} tall.&lt;ref name=randall&gt;{{cite book| first=Frank Alfred| last=Randall| editor-first=John D.| editor-last=Randall| title=History of the Development of Building Construction in Chicago| publisher=University of Illinois Press| year=1999| page=110| isbn=978-0252024160| quote=The practice of general contracting is said to have been first employed here by George A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23632">Throughout the industrial world, cities were hit hard during the [[Great Depression]], beginning in 1929 and lasting through most of the 1930s. Worst hit were port cities (as world trade fell) and cities that depended on heavy industry, such as steel and automobiles. Service-oriented cities were hurt less severely. Political centers such as Canada, Texas, Washington, London and Berlin flourished during the Great Depression, as the expanded role of government added many new jobs.

==British Commonwealth and Empire==
{{see also|Great Depression in Australia|Great Depression in India|Great Depression in South Africa}}
===Canada===
{{Main article|Great Depression in Canada}}
Canada's economy at the time was just starting to industrialize primary industries (agriculture, fishing, mining and logging) to manufacturing. Exports and prices of raw materials plunged, and employment, prices and profits fell in every sector. Canada was the worst-hit (after the United States) because of its economic position. It was further affected as its main trading partners were the U.S. and Britain.

The hardest-hit cities were the heavy industry centers of [[Southern Ontario]].  They included [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] (Canada's largest steel center), [[Toronto]], [[Tilbury, Ontario|Tilbury]], and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], an automotive manufacturing center linked to its larger neighbour, Detroit.  In Ontario, unemployment skyrocketed to roughly 45%.&lt;ref&gt;http://data4.archives.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s2=&amp;s4=&amp;s3=&amp;s1=kingston&amp;s6=y+and+gif&amp;s8=&amp;Sect4=AND&amp;l=0&amp;Sect1=IMAGE&amp;Sect2=THESOFF&amp;Sect4=AND&amp;Sect5=FOTOPEN&amp;Sect6=HITOFF&amp;d=FOTO&amp;p=1&amp;u=http://www.archives.ca/02/02011503_e.html&amp;r=123&amp;f=G Public works projects at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prairie Provinces and [[Western Canada]] were among the hardest-hit; they fully recovered after 1939. The fall of wheat prices drove many farmers to the towns and cities, such as [[Calgary, Alberta]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], and [[Brandon, Manitoba]].

Women held 25-30% of the jobs in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;In Toronto women held 28%; in Winnipeg 26%; in Montreal 25%.  Canada, Bureau of the Census, ''Occupations and Industries'' Vol. VII (Ottawa 1931), pp 226, 250, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Few women were employed in heavy industry, railways or construction. Many were household workers or were employed in restaurants and family-owned shops. Women factory workers typically handled clothing and food. Educated women had a narrow range of jobs, such as clerical work and teaching.  It was expected that a woman give up a good job when she married.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Hobbs and Alice Kessler-Harris, "Rethinking Antifeminism in the 1930s: Gender Crisis or Workplace Justice? A Response to Alice Kessler-Harris," ''Gender and History,'' (April 1993) 5#1 pp 4-15&lt;/ref&gt;  Srigley emphasizes the wide range of background factors and family circumstances, arguing that "gender" itself was typically less important than race, ethnicity, or class.&lt;ref&gt;Katrina Srigley, "'In Case You Hadn't Noticed!' Race, Ethnicity, and Women's Wage-earning in a Depression-era City." ''Labour'' 2005 (55): 69-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
Singapore, at the time of British colony, was integrated into the world economy and suffered economic declines like other trading cities.  However the people of Singapore were resilient in coping. Those who remained in the city used complex relationships among Chinese kinfolk; they shared food, housing, and clothing, and minimized the negative impacts. They spread work around, and provided an intelligence network to assist relatives in finding temporary employment. The safety valve of emigration to rural areas reduced the overall negative impact.&lt;ref&gt;Kah Seng Loh, "Records and Voices of Social History: The Case of the Great Depression in Singapore," ''Tonan Ajia Kenkyu: Japanese Journal of Southeast Asian Studies''. (2006) 44#1 pp 31-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Huff, "Entitlements, destitution, and emigration in the 1930s Singapore great depression," ''Economic History Review'' (2001) 54#2 pp 290-323&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Great Depression in the United Kingdom}}
Although the impact of the Great Depression on Great Britain was less severe than elsewhere, the industrial cities of the Midlands, the North, and Scotland were very hard-hit.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Gray, ''Worst of Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression in Britain'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Liverpool and Manchester with years of high unemployment had already acquired a reputation as highly depressed areas. City leaders fought back, have promoted a series of reforms and innovations in the infrastructure that made them leaders in the new urban redevelopment.  Grandiose projects included the [[Wythenshawe Estate]], the [[Mersey Tunnel]] and the [[Manchester Central Library]].  They created jobs and boosted local economies and morale. Promoters strongly emphasized how the redevelopment projects presented new images of Liverpool and Manchester. One goal was to integrate the newly enfranchised voters, a strategy also employed by the Conservative party to engage with the mass electorate.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Wildman, "Urban Transformation in Liverpool and Manchester, 1918–1939," ''Historical Journal'' (2012) 55#1 pp 119-143.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==France ==
The worldwide Great Depression had a moderate impact on the French economy, which proved resilient.  Conditions worsened  in 1931 bringing hardships and a more somber mood. Unemployment rose, and hours of work were cut; however the price of food sharply declined, offsetting some of the hardship.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Jackson, ''The Politics of Depression in France 1932-1936'' (2002) pp 23-27&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Paris declined slightly from its all-time peak of 2.9 million in 1921 to 2.8 million in 1936. The arrondissements in the center lost as much as twenty percent of their population, while the outer neighborhoods, gained ten percent. The low birth rate of Parisians was compensated by a new wave of immigration from Russia, Poland, Germany, eastern and central Europe, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Political tensions mounted in Paris with strikes, demonstrations and confrontations between the Communists and [[Popular Front (France)|''Front populaire'']] on the extreme left and the [[Action Française]] on the extreme right.&lt;ref&gt;Yvan Combeau, ''Histoire de Paris'' (Paris, 2013),  p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
{{further information|Economy of Nazi Germany}}
In Germany, the depression had reached its worst in 1932, with 6 million unemployed, spread throughout every city. From 1928 to 1932 unemployment in Berlin soared from 133,000 to 600,000. In [[Hamburg]], a port city, the numbers went from 32,000 to 135,000.  In [[Dortmund]], in the [[Ruhrgebiet|Ruhr industrial region]], it went from 12,000 to 65,000. Berlin verged on political chaos as Communist and Nazi paramilitary forces fought for control of the streets. Overall the Nazis were weakest in the largest cities, which were controlled by Socialist and Communist parties (and in Catholic areas, the Center party). After 1933, the Nazi government greatly expanded arms production, which reduced unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Panikos Panayi, "Everyday Life in a German Town," ''History Today'' (2002) 52#9 pp p31-37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Tooze, ''The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin, and the other cultural centers, were especially hard-hit. The publicly subsidized city and state theaters that were the center of cultural life took heavy cuts. After 1933, the Nazis imposed a new, heavily subsidized cultural order that glorified Nazi ideals and ridiculed the artistic achievements of the Weimar era.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Christian Führer, "German Cultural Life and the Crisis of National Identity During the Depression, 1929-1933," ''German Studies Review'' (2001) 24#3 pp 461-486.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Union==
The Soviet Union was largely cut off from world affairs, and during the 1930s was engaged in a very large scale maneuver to force peasants off the land and relocating them in industrial cities. Many factories, electrical plants, and transportation facilities were built along these lines. The most dramatic showpiece was the Moscow subway. The [[Moscow Metro]] opened in 1935 and immediately became the centerpiece of the transportation system. More than that it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. [[Lazar Kaganovich]] was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example,  the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new "Homo Sovieticus." (Soviet man).&lt;ref&gt;Isabel Wünsche, "Homo Sovieticus: The Athletic Motif in the Design of the Dynamo Metro Station," ''Studies in the Decorative Arts'' (2000) 7#2 pp 65-90&lt;/ref&gt;  The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order—a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jenks, "A Metro on the Mount," ''Technology &amp; Culture'' (2000) 41#4 pp 697-723p&lt;/ref&gt;  Soviet workers did the labor and the art work, but the main engineering designs, routes, and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the London Underground.  The Britons called for tunneling instead of the "cut-and-cover" technique, the use of escalators instead of lifts, and designed the routes and the rolling stock.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Robbins, "London Underground and Moscow Metro," ''Journal of Transport History,'' (1997) 18#1 pp 45-53.&lt;/ref&gt;  The paranoia of Stalin and the NKVD was evident when the secret police arrested numerous British engineers for espionage—that is for gaining an in-depth knowledge of the city's physical layout. Engineers for the Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company were given a show trial and deported in 1933, ending the role of British business in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon W. Morrell, "Redefining Intelligence and Intelligence-Gathering: The Industrial Intelligence Centre and the Metro-Vickers Affair, Moscow 1933," ''Intelligence and National Security'' (1994) 9#3 pp 520-533.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
U.S. larger cities in the 1920s enjoyed strong growth. With the end of large-scale immigration, populations stabilized and the plentiful jobs in the cities pulled families upwards in terms of social mobility. Investment in office buildings, stores, factories, utilities, streets, and, especially, apartments and single-family homes, added substantially to the infrastructure, and contributed to the notion that better times lay ahead. However, after 1929, the optimism ebbed away, overwhelmed by a deepening pessimism that made long-term private investment seem inadvisable.

The Depression's damage to large cities, suburbs, towns and rural areas varied according to the economic base.  Most serious in larger cities was the collapse of the construction industry with new starts falling to less than 10% of the norm of the late 1920s.  Although much needed work was deferred, maintenance and repair of existing structures comprised over a third of the private sector construction budget in the 1930s. Devastating was the disappearance of 2 million high paying jobs in the construction trades, plus the loss of profits and rents that humbled many thousands of landlords and real estate investors.

Second came the general downturn in industry, especially heavy manufacturing. Steel in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], and automobiles in [[Detroit]] took the heaviest hits, along with railroads and [[coal mining]]. In these sectors, the largest cities suffered somewhat less than smaller mill towns, mining camps and railroad centers.  Unemployment was a problem everywhere, but it was less severe among women than men, among workers in non-durable industries (such as food and clothing), in services and sales, and in government jobs.  A sharp educational gradient meant that the less skilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates than the high-school and college educated men who lived in outer zones and suburbs.

Although suburbia stopped growing, it did not suffer nearly as much as the central cities.  While some unemployed came to the cities looking for relief, it appears that even larger numbers of unemployed returned to family farms. For the first time ever, the movement of native population was away from cities and toward rural America.

The fiscal soundness of city and county governments was challenged by the rise in relief expenditures and the sharp fall in tax collections. The [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] Administration had encouraged state and local governments to expand public works projects, which they did in 1930 and 1931. While this expansion may have slowed the rise in unemployment, the spending was a luxury that could not be borne in the face of falling tax revenues and the unwillingness of investors to put more money into municipal bonds. After 1933, new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress.

===Relief===
While local relief before 1932 focused on providing small sums of cash or baskets of food and coal for the neediest, the federal programs launched by Hoover and greatly expanded by the [[New Deal]] tried to use massive construction projects with prevailing wages to jumpstart the economy and solve the unemployment crisis.  ERA, [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|FERA]], [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] and [[Public Works Administration|PWA]] built and repaired the public infrastructure in dramatic fashion but did little to foster the recovery of the private sector. In sharp contrast to Britain, where private housing construction pulled the country out of depression, American cities saw little private construction or investment, and so they languished in the economic doldrums even as their parks, sewers, airports and municipal buildings were enhanced. The problem in retrospect was that the New Deal's investment in the public infrastructure had only a small "multiplier" effect, in contrast to the high multiplier for jobs that private investment might have created.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Jensen]], "The Causes and Cures of Unemployment in the Great Depression." There were also small camps called hoovervilles that had very poor people living in them.
, ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (1989) 19:553-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Deal politics===
[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] had a magnetic appeal to the city dwellers&amp;mdash;he brought relief and recognition of their ethnic leaders and ward bosses, as well as labor unions. Taxpayers, small business and the middle class voted for Roosevelt in 1936 but turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937-38 seemed to belie his promises of recovery. Roosevelt's [[New Deal Coalition]] discovered an entirely new use for city machines in his three reelection campaigns of the [[New Deal]] and the [[Second World War]]. Traditionally, local bosses minimized turnout so as to guarantee reliable control of their wards and legislative districts. To carry the [[electoral college]], however, Roosevelt needed to carry the entire state, and thus needed massive majorities in the largest cities to overcome the hostility of suburbs  and towns.

With [[Harry Hopkins]] his [[majordomo]], Roosevelt used the WPA as a national political machine.  Men on relief could get WPA jobs regardless of their politics, but hundreds of thousands of well-paid supervisory jobs were given to the local Democratic machines.  The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% of their ballots for Roosevelt. The vibrant labor unions, heavily based in the cities, likewise did their utmost for their benefactor, voting 80% for him, as did [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[Jewish American|Jewish]] voters. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere. Roosevelt won reelection in 1940 thanks to the cities.  In the [[Northern United States|North]], the cities over 100,000 gave Roosevelt 60% of their votes, while the rest of the North favored Willkie 52%-48%. It was just enough to provide the critical electoral college  margin. With the start of full-scale war mobilization in the  summer of 1940, the cities revived. The new war economy pumped  massive investments into new factories and funded round-the-clock  munitions production, guaranteeing a job to anyone who showed up at the factory gate.&lt;ref&gt;Voting information on groups from Hadley Cantril and Mildred Strunk, eds. ''Public Opinion, 1935-1946'' (1951) and George Horace Gallup, ed.

(1981) pp 219-225,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organized crime===
The [[American mafia]] and some other [[organized crime]] syndicates, which had emerged during Prohibition, usually retained power despite heavy pressure from the FBI and federal authorities.  Those mob figures that had not been shut down by the authorities often already ran powerful business empires and, though the declining economy severely challenged them, the desperation of the unemployed and underemployed working class often increased their power and influence. Gambling, prostitution, and loansharking provided substitutes for illegal liquor.

Some cities managed to thrive during the Depression because of the economic activity generated by criminal enterprises. [[Atlantic City]], long an established resort town, struggled during the Depression but managed to maintain a strong economy in large part due to illegal gambling activities with an unlimited supply of customers from Philadelphia and New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Johnson, ''Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Galveston, Texas]] was one of the most successful examples; the island city, [[Free State of Galveston]], run by the Maceo syndicate, became a major resort town due to its lavish, illegal casino districts enabled by a corrupt law enforcement environment.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Cartwright,  ''Galveston: A History of the Island'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The small, desert town of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] began to develop based on vice businesses during this period with the added advantage that laws there were much less strict.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene P. Moehring, ''Resort City in the Sunbelt: Las Vegas, 1930-2000'' (U of Nevada Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manila===
In the American colony of the Philippines, the Main political dispute over independence was settled by 1934 with the decision that the Philippines would become independent in 1946. The Great Depression was much less severe than in the United States, primarily because the sharp drop in the cost of food work to the benefit of the working class in the city. Washington provided much of the funding for a large middle-class bureaucracy and for major construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel F. Doeppers, "Metropolitan Manila in the Great Depression: Crisis for Whom?" ''Journal of Asian Studies'' (1991) 50#3 pp 511-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Claude Robert Eatherly''' (October 2, 1918 &amp;ndash; July 1, 1978) was an officer in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]], and the pilot of a weather reconnaissance aircraft [[Straight Flush (B-29)|''Straight Flush'']] that supported the dropping of the [[atomic bomb]] on [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]], August 6, 1945.

==Early life and education==
Claude Eatherly was born in [[Van Alstyne, Texas|Van Alstyne]], Texas, fifty miles northeast of [[Dallas]]. His parents, James E. “Bud” Eatherly and Edna Bell George, were both farmers, and Eatherly himself dropped out of North Texas State Teachers’ College in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]] in his senior year to join the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] in December, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.0700432|title=Eatherly, Claude Robert (1918-1978), U.S. Army Air Force pilot|first=Mark T.|last=Gilderhus|date=1 February 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=9 October 2018|doi=10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.0700432}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from bomber school and was commissioned a second lieutenant in August, 1941.

==Career and the bombing of Hiroshima==
{{main|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}
Eatherly was the pilot of [[Straight Flush]], one of seven [[B-29]]s of the [[393d Bomb Squadron]] of the [[509th Operations Group|509th Composite Group]] that took part in the Hiroshima mission, which was the culmination of ten months of training during [[World War II]]. It departed [[North Field (Tinian)|Tinian Island]] at approximately 0137 hours on the morning of August 6, 1945, a little more than an hour ahead of the [[Enola Gay]] (which carried the bomb) and flew over Hiroshima with the task of reporting the weather conditions.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} After reporting the weather was good over the target, Eatherly turned Straight Flush for home, and was over {{convert|300|mi}} from ground zero when the bomb exploded.

==Later life==
Eatherly desperately wanted to remain in the air force, but assigned to meteorology training, he was caught cheating on coursework and was forced to take an honorable discharge. He left the Air Force in 1947 as a [[major]], and worked at an oil company in Houston, Texas where he became a sales manager for a [[Mobil]] gasoline station.{{clarify|date=May 2013}} Consumed by guilt, he attempted suicide by drugs in a hotel in New Orleans, but he survived and was treated in Waco, Texas in a psychiatric hospital for soldiers. His mental condition slowly deteriorated.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Jerome Klinkowitz, in ''Pacific Skies: American Flyers in World War II'', writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shortly after leaving the Air Force in 1947, Eatherly took part in arrangements for a raid on Cuba by American adventurers hoping to overthrow the government; here the former weather pilot's responsibilities would involve a flight of bomb-laden P-38 Lightnings obtained as war surplus. The plot was uncovered, and Eatherly was arrested and prosecuted, serving time in jail for this offense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eatherly claimed to have become horrified by his participation in the Hiroshima bombing, and hopeless at the possibility of repenting for or earning forgiveness for willfully extinguishing so many lives and causing so much pain. He tried speaking out with pacifist groups, sending parts of his paycheck to Hiroshima, writing letters of apology, and once or twice may have attempted suicide. At one point "he set out to try to discredit the popular myth of the war hero [by] committing petty crimes from which he derived no benefit: he was tried for various forgeries and forged a check for a small amount and contributed the money to a fund for the children of Hiroshima. He held up banks and broke into post offices without ever taking anything."&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, p ?&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2013}} He was convicted of [[forgery]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and served one year between 1954 and 1955 for the crime. He was also convicted of [[burglary|breaking and entering]] in West Texas. He then became a salesman in a garage and might have attempted suicide again by drug. In 1959 he avoided prosecution for robbery by entering the [[Veterans Administration Hospital]] in Waco, Texas for many months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|date=December 20, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some think he committed antisocial acts because of [[schizophrenia]] or [[anxiety disorder]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

It was in this hospital that he began to correspond with [[Günther Anders]], an Austrian philosopher and pacifist, who became his friend in a battle to promote the abolition of nuclear weapons. Eatherly wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whilst in no sense, I hope, either a religious or a political fanatic, I have for some time felt convinced that the crisis in which we are all involved is one calling for a thorough re-examination of our whole scheme of values and of loyalties. In the past it has sometimes been possible for men to "coast along" without posing to themselves too many searching questions about the way they are accustomed to think and to act — but it is reasonably clear now that our age is not one of these. On the contrary I believe that we are rapidly approaching a situation in which we shall be compelled to re-examine our willingness to surrender responsibility for our thoughts and actions to some social institution such as the political party, trade union, church or State. None of these institutions are adequately equipped to offer infallible advice on moral issues and their claim to offer such advice needs therefore to be challenged.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Bradford Huie]], in ''The Hiroshima Pilot'', cast doubt on the Eatherly story, pointing out that Eatherly continued to practice for potential future nuclear bombing missions in the years following the war. He believes that pacifist and anti-nuclear activists created or exaggerated elements of Eatherly’s story for propaganda purposes, and that Eatherly cooperated in this mythmaking from desire for fame or attention. Some of this skepticism was disputed in ''Dark Star'' by [[Ronnie Dugger]]. No other persons involved with the bombing of Hiroshima expressed guilt in the way that Eatherly did. ''Enola Gay'' pilot and commanding officer of the 509th Composite Group, Colonel Paul Tibbets, said in his autobiography "Flight of the Enola Gay" that he couldn’t understand why Eatherly felt so guilty. While Eatherly did command the weather B-29 that scouted Hiroshima about an hour ahead of Tibbet's B-29 (which was carrying the "Little Boy" atomic bomb), "Buck" Eatherly had already turned back for their Tinian Island base by the time the bomb was dropped. To quote Tibbets: "Actually, Major Eatherly did not take part in the attack and did not see the bomb blast that was supposed to have haunted him through many sleepless nights."{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Contrary to popular opinion, one of Eatherly's Straight Flush crewmen has suggested that Eatherly was actually upset that the Hiroshima raid had not made him famous, and was only too eager to play to the journalists that came to get the story of the "distraught pilot".

The '''''Concordia''''' was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] sailing ship that left [[Jakarta|Batavia]] on 15 January 1708 with two other vessels, ''Zuiderburg'' and ''Mercurius''. ''Concordia'' had 130 people on board and was bound for the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and then the Netherlands. She was last sighted by ''Mercurius'' in open seas to the south of [[Sunda Strait]] on 5 February 1708, in bad weather.

== History ==

Built in 1696, ''Concordia'' was a large ship for her day, being approximately 900 tons.
On 15 January 1708, under the command of Joris Vis, the ''Concordia'' set out from Batavia on a return trip to the Netherlands with two other VOC ships; ''Zuiderberg'' and ''Mercurius''.&lt;ref name=Institute&gt;Instituut voor Nederlandse Geschiedenis (2008). [http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/DAS/detailVoyage/97069 Details of voyage 6183.3 from Batavia]. Retrieved on 10 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 130 passengers and crew on board, there were several women returning home and some [[Balinese people|Balinese]] being deported from the [[Dutch East Indies]] to the Cape of Good Hope, due to bad conduct.&lt;ref name=Tom&gt;Ammerlaan, Tom (2004). [http://www.ammerlaan.demon.nl/EARLY.HTM ''Early Dutch emigrants to Australia: Chapter 8'']. Retrieved on 10 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the ''Mercurius'' reached the Cape of Good Hope. The Captain of ''Mercurius'' reported that ''Concordia'' and ''Zuiderburg'' had last been sighted together in open seas to the south of Sunda Strait on 5 February 1708, in bad weather. On 22 February, the crew of ''Mercurius'' found floating debris. They saw several goods in the water, some firewood, a chest of tea, a Chintz piece of cotton, a carpenters boor, white candles, and the staves for barrels.&lt;ref name=Tom/&gt; The ''Concordia'' was officially listed as being lost somewhere near [[Mauritius]] in 1708.&lt;ref name=Dutch&gt;[http://www.lifeonperth.com/dutchshipwrecks.htm Dutch Shipwrecks on the Western Australian Coastline] (2008).

One known passenger aboard the ''Concordia'' was Mr Constantijn van Baerle, a VOC official.&lt;ref name=Tom/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constantijn van Baerle (2008). [http://members.chello.nl/m.schaap11/stamboom/html/constantijn_van_baerle.html Constantijn van Baerle]. Retrieved on 10 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mystery ==

In 1832, a covert English expedition to inland Australia commanded by a Lieutenant Nixon reportedly discovered a group of white Dutch people (80 men and 10 females) living in a desert [[oasis]] believed to be [[Palm Valley (Northern Territory)|Palm Valley]] in the [[Northern Territory]].  The existence was first reported in February 1834, in an English newspaper called ''The Leeds Mercury''.&lt;ref name=VOC&gt;VOC Historical Society (2008). [http://www.voc.iinet.net.au/palmv.html ''What happened to the white settlers at Palm Valley?''] Retrieved online 12 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; There were other articles in a Dutch scientific journal, and the ''[[Perth Gazette]]'' of 1837.&lt;ref name=Tom/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dutch/&gt;

The ''Leeds Mercury'' story claimed that Lt. Nixon had spoken to the settlers in a broken form of old Dutch and the leader or chief of the group, was a descendant of an officer whose name was "van Baerle". The party remained with the group for eight days.

Nixon stated:

{{Cquote| ... ''their fathers were compelled by famine, after the loss of their great vessel, to travel towards the rising sun, carrying with them as much of the stores as they could, during which many died; and by the wise advice of their ten sisters they crossed a ridge of land, and meeting with a rivulet on the other side, followed its course and were led to the spot they now inhabit, where they have continued ever since''.&lt;ref name=Tom/&gt;&lt;ref name=VOC/&gt;}}

Despite extensive research, no trace or direct evidence of the settlers has ever been found.  Historians now believe the original 1834 ''Leeds Mercury'' story was a [[hoax]].&lt;ref name=Dutch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VOC Historical Society (2006).

The '''Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union''' ({{lang-ru|'''Съезд народных депутатов СССР'''|''Sʺezd narodnykh deputatov SSSR''}}) was the highest body of state authority of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1989 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e9CPy7ukI9gC&amp;pg=PA369 1977 USSR Constitution (as amended on 1988)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union was created as part of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[Perestroika|reform agenda]], and was enabled by Gorbachev's first constitutional change.

On 1 July 1988, the fourth and last day of the [[19th All-Union Conference of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Conference]], Gorbachev won the backing of the delegates for his last minute proposal to create a new supreme legislative body called the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union. Frustrated by the 'old guard's resistance to his attempts to liberalise Gorbachev had changed tack and embarked upon a set of constitutional changes to try and separate party and state, and thereby isolate his conservative opponents. Detailed proposals for the new Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union were published for public consultation on 2 October 1988,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/02/world/government-in-the-soviet-union-gorbachev-s-proposal-for-change.html?scp=4&amp;sq=NEW+SOVIET+CONGRESS&amp;st=nyt&lt;/ref&gt; and to enable the creation of the new legislature the Supreme Soviet, during its 29 November to 1 December 1988 session, implemented the amendments to the [[1977 Soviet Constitution]], enacted a law on electoral reform, and set the date of the election for 26 March 1989.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipu.org/english/parline/reports/arc/2263%5F89.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The Congress consisted of 2,250 deputies elected in three different ways:
* 750 deputies were elected according to the system used in [[Soviet of the Union]] elections in the 1936–1989 period.
* 750 deputies were elected according to the system used in [[Soviet of Nationalities]] elections in the 1936–1989 period.
* 750 deputies representing "public organizations", such as the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], [[Komsomol]] and the [[trade union]]s. The election law would allocate a fixed number of seats to organizations.

The congress would gather twice a year and would then elect the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] consisting of a smaller number of deputies. The Supreme Soviet would then serve as a permanent legislature, deciding all but the most important issues, such as amendments to the Soviet constitution, which were left to the full Congress only.

==Electoral Process==
[[File:Boris Yeltsin 1 February 1989-1.jpg|thumb|Boris Yeltsin during his electoral campaign on 1 February 1989]]
The month-long nomination of candidates for the Congress of People's Deputies of the USSR (CPD) lasted until 24 January 1989. For the next month, selection among the 7,531 districts nominees took place at meetings organized by constituency-level electoral commissions. On 7 March, a final list of 5,074 candidates (one in 399 constituencies, two in 953 constituencies and three or more in 163 constituencies) was published; approximately 85% of these were members of the ruling Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and 17% were women.

In the two weeks prior to the 1,500 districts polls, elections to fill 750 reserved seats of public organizations, contested by 880 candidates, were held. Of these seats, 100 were allocated to the CPSU, 100 to the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, 75 to the Communist Youth Union (Komsomol), 75 to the Soviet Women's Committee, 75 to the War and Labour Veterans' Organization, and 325 to other organizations such as the Academy of Sciences. The selection process was ultimately completed in April.

In the 26 March general elections, voter participation was reported at 89.8%. With this polling, 1,958 – including 1,225 district seats – of the 2,250 CPD seats were filled. In the district races, run-off elections were held in 76 constituencies on 2 and 9 April and fresh elections were organized on 20 April and 14 to 23 May in the 199 remaining constituencies where the required absolute majority was not attained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipu.org/english/parline/reports/arc/2263%5F89.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congress Sessions==

At its first session commencing on 25 May, the CPD proceeded to choose the 542 Supreme Soviet members from among 573 candidates. Final results were announced on 27 May. The Supreme Soviet, a "permanent legislative, administrative and central body of state authority of the USSR", is to be convened annually by its Presidium for its recurrent spring and autumn sessions to last, as a rule, three to four months each.

The Supreme Soviet was convened for its first session on 3 June. On 21 July, the composition of the new Council of Ministers, headed by [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], was announced.

Only one Congress [[Soviet Union legislative election, 1989|was elected, in March 1989]]. The fundamental difference from previous elections in Soviet Union was that elections were actually competitive. Instead of one Communist Party-approved candidate for each seat, multiple candidates were allowed. A variety of different political positions, from Communist to pro-Western, were represented in the Congress, and lively debates took place with different viewpoints expressed.

As a result of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'etat attempt|attempted coup in August 1991]], the Congress dissolved itself on 5 September 1991, handing on its powers to the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] and newly created [[State Council of the Soviet Union|USSR State Council]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://pravo.levonevsky.org/baza/soviet/sssr0036.htm Soviet Union law from 5 September 1991 #2392-I «On State authorities of the Soviet Union during transitional period»]&lt;/ref&gt; which (Soviet and State Council) ceased to exist on 26 December 1991, along with the Soviet Union itself.

The '''DFW Writers Conference''', also known as '''DFWCon''', is an American annual professional conference for writers in multiple genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Shaw Guides |title=DFW Writers Conference |url=http://writing.shawguides.com/dfwwritersconference |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401215916/http://writing.shawguides.com/dfwwritersconference |archive-date= April 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It always takes place in a city within the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]], normally in the spring months.

==Plot==
An aphrodisiac peddler, Cheng Yong is in financial trouble. His store has not been making profits for a long time and his father urgently needs a large sum of money for brain surgery.

One day a man wearing thick layers of surgical masks comes to his shop. He asks Cheng to bring a cheap drug from India in return for a large sum of money. The Swiss drug Geliening is very expensive in China, due to patent protection, causing many patients to not be able to afford the treatments, but, a very inexpensive generic version of it is available in India.

Desperate for money, Cheng agrees to risk smuggling the drug into China. As more CML patients buy drugs from him, Cheng becomes rich. His motivation starts to change after he witnesses devastated patients whose family has been pushed into poverty by costly cancer treatments, walk away with hope for the future.
At the same time, Chinese law enforcement agencies notices the availability of the contraband Geliening and vows to crackdown on the unlicensed generic drug as the originator company of the drug begins to sue the Indian government for infringing its patent.

==Critical reception==
Pang-Chieh Ho of SupChina wrote that ''Dying to Survive'' "might be China's best movie of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ho |first=Pang-Chieh |title='Dying to Survive,' a comedy about illegally importing drugs, might be China's best movie of the year |url=https://supchina.com/2018/07/06/dying-to-survive-might-be-chinas-best-movie-of-the-year/ |accessdate=July 6, 2018 |work=SupChina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film sparked debate about the cost of medical care among Chinese people. Chinese Premier [[Li Keqiang]] cited the film in an appeal to regulators to "speed up price cuts for cancer drugs" and "reduce the burden on families".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1K80TH|title=Cancer drug movie strikes nerve in China, becomes box-office hit|website=Reuters|date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in December 2002 by [[SPH Magazines]], the magazine was &lt;!-- still? update verb tense if possible --&gt;the only [[Singapore]]an publication entirely about movies. Each issue contains reviews of films and [[DVD]]s, as well as collectibles such as posters and postcards. The magazine also includes movie news, early buzz about upcoming films and exclusive interviews. The magazine focuses mostly on [[Hong Kong cinema|films from Hong Kong]] and [[American cinema|the U.S.]] Often, freebies such as double-sided posters, postcard packs or A4-sized posters are enclosed.

'''Formula Challenge Japan''' is an [[open wheel racing]] series based in Japan. The first season was in 2006 and carried on from the defunct [[Formula Dream]] series. It is promoted as a young driver development project jointly by [[Honda]], [[Toyota]] and [[Nissan]] and is positioned as an intermediate level of the domestic motorsport in Japan, lower than the [[All-Japan Formula Three Championship]], but above F4.

Formula Challenge Japan ended after the 2013 season, and was replaced by [[Japan Formula 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honda.co.jp/news/2013/c130628.html|title=「フォーミュラチャレンジ・ジャパン」休止にともなう「Hondaフォーミュラ・ドリーム・プロジェクト」参戦カテゴリーについて|date=2013-06-28|accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Being backed by the three major automobile manufacturers in Japan, the driver of the series generally consists of the drivers graduating from the racing schools managed by those three, plus a number of privateers meeting the prerequisites.

To participate in the FCJ series,&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-nippon.co.jp/fcj/whats/ |title=Formula Challenge Japan Official Website: Philosophy of FCJ |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2009-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027033302/http://www.f-nippon.co.jp/fcj/whats/ |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a driver needs to be younger than 26 years old and possess a National A racing license, but not having raced in [[Formula Three]] or above to participate, with a year's subscription fee of around 7.5 million yen.&lt;ref name="recruitment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-nippon.co.jp/fcj/fcnap/app/cNList02.dll/?No=NS013416 |title=2010年フォーミュラチャレンジ・ジャパン募集 (終了) (Japanese text) |accessdate=2009-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615233656/http://www.f-nippon.co.jp/fcj/fcnap/app/cNList02.dll/?No=NS013416 |archivedate=June 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a series primarily catering the upcoming Japanese drivers, as of 2009 there were foreign drivers competing in the series.

The cars are [[open wheel car|open wheeler]]s, running on a Tatuus chassis 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tatuus.it/racecars/fc106.html |title=Tatuus Formula FC106 |accessdate=2009-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329082812/http://www.tatuus.it/racecars/fc106.html |archivedate=March 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and is mated to a 2.0&amp;nbsp;L 200&amp;nbsp;hp engine and a six-speed sequential gearbox, similar to a [[Formula Renault]] 2.0 car. The engine is a Renault F4R unit badged as FCJ and maintained by Nismo. The tires are manufactured by Dunlop. To ensure parity of the cars, the engine and gearbox are both sealed prior to being delivered to the competitors so that no private tuning could be carried out in between. Moreover, the cars are centrally maintained by the organizers for this purpose.

As of 2009 the series is run on the same weekends as the Formula Nippon race weekend, and visits the major circuits in Japan like [[Fuji Speedway]], [[Suzuka Circuit]], [[Twin Ring Motegi]] and [[Sportsland Sugo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-nippon.co.jp/fcj/race/2009/race_top.shtml |title=Formula Challenge Japan official website: Race Calendar |accessdate=2009-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405195828/http://www.f-nippon.co.jp/fcj/race/2009/race_top.shtml |archivedate=April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IFRS 10''', '''IFRS 11''' and '''IFRS 12''' are three [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) promulgated by the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) providing accounting guidance related to [[Consolidated financial statement|consolidation]] and [[joint venture]]s.  The standards were issued in 2011 and became effective in 2013.&lt;ref name=ey&gt;{{cite web|title=IASB issues three new standards: Consolidated Financial Statements, Joint Arrangements, and Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities|url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/IFRS_Developments_Issue_1/$File/IFRS_Developments_Issue_1_GL_IFRS.pdf|publisher=[[Ernst &amp; Young]]|accessdate=2014-08-31|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IFRS 10 addresses [[consolidated financial statements]], IFRS 11 addresses joint ventures and IFRS 12 address disclosures of interests in other entities.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;  The standards were developed in part in response to the [[financial crisis of 2008]].&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;&lt;ref name=dt&gt;{{cite web|title=Insights into IFRS Insurance: IFRS 10, 11 and 12 and Insurers|url=http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Global/Local%20Content/Articles/Financial%20Services/Insurance%20IFRS/6%20%20Fact%20Sheet%20-IFRS%2010%2011%20and%2012%20and%20Insurers.pdf|publisher=[[Deloitte]]|accessdate=2014-08-31|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the crisis, accounting rules were criticized for permitting certain risky arrangements to be excluded from company [[balance sheet]]s.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;  IFRS 10 revised the definition of having "control" of another entity, and thus requiring that entity to be consolidated onto the controlling entity's balance sheet.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;  The revised definition is expected to increase the likelihood that an entity is deemed to have control over another.&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;&lt;ref name=ey2/&gt;  IFRS 11 largely retained previous accounting guidance for joint ventures, but adopted the IFRS 10 definition of "control," meaning that "joint control" would be deemed to exist in some circumstances where it wasn't previously, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;&lt;ref name=ey2&gt;{{cite web|title=IFRS 10, 11 and 12 on consolidation and joint arrangements|url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Consolidation_and_joint_arrangements_IFRS_10_11_12/$FILE/Consolidation_and_joint_arrangements_IFRS_10_11_12.pdf|publisher=[[Ernst &amp; Young]]|date=2011|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IFRS 12 requires the disclosures related to [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]], joint ventures and interests in other entities which are not consolidated to be combined into a single disclosure.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;  It also requires disclosures about judgements used to determine whether control exists, why it determined that control did not exist and its relationship with entities it did not consolidate.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;  These extra disclosures were also in response of criticism of the previous accounting guidance in light of the financial crisis.&lt;ref name=dt/&gt;

The [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB), which promulgates accounting standards in the United States, also revised its consolidation rules in response to the financial crisis, although its revised guidance is not identical to IFRS 10, 11 and 12.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;  However, IFRS 11 is very close to the FASB guidance for joint ventures.&lt;ref name=ey/&gt;

'''Internet hunting''' is the practice of [[hunting]] via remotely controlled [[firearms]] that can be aimed and shot using online [[webcams]]. The first internet hunting website, Live-Shot.com, was created in 2005 by John Lockwood, who saw it as a way to provide an authentic hunting experience for disabled persons.&lt;ref name=Axtman&gt;{{cite news | author = Kris Axtman | title =  Hunting by remote control draws fire from all quarters | work = [[The Christian Science Monitor]] | date = April 5, 2005 | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0405/p01s02-ussc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[The Humane Society of the United States|Humane Society]], the operation consisted of "a fenced pen stocked with animals [where Lockwood] set up a tripod with a camera and a firearm". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Drew Sandholm | title = Internet Hunting: Click &amp; Kill | work = KSFY Action News | date = February 2, 2008 | url = http://www.ksfy.com/news/local/15148431.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost as soon as internet hunting was introduced in the U.S. state of [[Texas]], strong opposition to the practice developed among pro-gun and pro-hunting organizations, including the [[National Rifle Association]] and [[Safari Club International]], as well as among animal rights and environmental groups. The majority of hunters do not consider the practice to be hunting, as it does not conform to the rules of a "[[fair chase]]".&lt;ref name=Axtman/&gt;&lt;ref name=HSUS-FactSheet&gt;Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, [http://www.hsus.org/wildlife_abuse/campaigns/internet/fact_sheet_internet_hunting.html Fact Sheet on Internet Hunting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028202802/http://www.hsus.org/wildlife_abuse/campaigns/internet/fact_sheet_internet_hunting.html |date=2008-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2008, forty U.S. states had enacted laws or regulations to ban internet hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Humane Society, [http://www.hsus.org/web-files/PDF/internethunting_map.pdf Map of Internet Hunting Bans] (Aug. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; These bans were supported by a Humane Society campaign, and according to the organization, internet hunting is no longer being practiced.&lt;ref name=HSUS-FactSheet/&gt; Critics say Internet hunting never existed as a viable industry, making much of the legislation curtailing it "a testament to public alarm over Internet threats and the gilded life of legislation that nobody opposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Zachary M. Seward | title = Internet Hunting Has Got to Stop -- If It Ever Starts | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = August 10, 2007 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118668766176893323?mod=hps_us_pageone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates see the legislation as a proactive measure that may yet curb the practice, which could easily spring up in states or other countries where it is not prohibited.

He was a senior [[Political consulting|advisor]] to and [[spokesman]] for [[Mitt Romney]]'s [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012|2012 U.S. presidential campaign]].

== Professional history ==

After graduating from college in 1994, Madden went to work for the [[Yonkers City Council]], working for Councilman Carlo DiNota. He soon became the spokesman for family friend [[John Spencer (mayor)|John Spencer]]'s successful 1996 [[Yonkers]] mayoral [[political campaign|campaign]].&lt;ref name="Chronicle20050808"&gt;"New DeLay spokesman at ease in a battle zone" by Samantha Levine, ''Houston Chronicle'', August 8, 2005, [http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/New-DeLay-spokesman-at-ease-in-a-battle-zone-1558387.php Retrieved 2012-08-29]&lt;/ref&gt; After helping Spencer win re-election, Madden moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] and, beginning in 2001, became senior policy advisor and chief spokesman for [[United States Congress|Congressman]] [[John E. Sweeney]].&lt;ref name="Morrisville2005"&gt;"Class Notes: Class of 1992", ''Morrisville State College Alumni News, Vol 79, Issue 02'', Winter 2005, page 5, [http://www.morrisville.edu/documents/alumni/alumninews/winter2005.pdf Retrieved 2012-08-29, Approx 1.9MB download]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 2000s, Madden had had several public relations positions for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], including as [[press secretary]] for [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[Leaders of the United States House of Representatives#Party leaders|Republican leadership]] (including then-[[Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]]&lt;ref name="Chronicle20050808"/&gt; and then-Majority Leader [[John Boehner]]); as [[news media|press]] spokesman for the [[George W.

Retrieved on 22 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Since many had to live in darkness due to supply cuts in electricity, gas, and water, the idea of putting up lights acted as a symbol of hope, recovery, and renovation.&lt;ref name="Modern Met"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lights"/&gt; Though it was only supposed to take place once, strong popularity and demand from citizens encouraged the continuation of luminarie to become an annual event.&lt;ref name="Official Site"/&gt;

Silent prayers to victims of the earthquake takes place in the opening ceremony, and a memorial naming those who were killed is posted during the night.&lt;ref name="Lights"/&gt;

=== Tohoku Initiative ===

In the 2011 luminarie, the same year as the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tohoku earthquake and tsunami]], a special exhibition was held to raise money for its victims. In the 2012 luminarie, drawings by children from that region were used to make lanterns displayed at the event.&lt;ref name="Going Global"/&gt;

== Tourist attraction ==

The Hanshin earthquake left Kobe at a slump with tourist attractions for obvious reasons. One of the factors that brought tourism back to Kobe was the sincerity of the luminarie event in honoring the victims of the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/1022963721?accountid=8555 “Recovery of japan tourism”], ''[[McClatchy - Tribune Business News]]'', 2012, July 02. Retrieved on 22 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event attracts around 4 million people to Kobe every year and raises $1.3 million in donations and $6.1 million in sponsorship and merchandise sales.&lt;ref name="Lights"/&gt;

The '''London Design Festival (LDF)''' is a citywide design event that takes place over nine days every September. Conceived by [[Sir John Sorrell]] and Ben Evans in 2003, the concept was to create an annual event to promote the city’s creativity, drawing in the country's thinkers, practitioners, retailers and educators to a deliver a diverse celebration of design.

== About ==
London Design Festival's vision is to celebrate and promote London as the design capital of the world. The Festival programme is made up of over 400 events and exhibitions staged by over 300 partner organisations across the design spectrum and from around the world. The Festival also commissions its own projects and produces a Guide every year, containing information about all activity.

Festival audiences are significant, with an estimated direct audience of over 450,000 people from over 75 countries in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts and Figures from the London Design Festival 2015|url=http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=4a7adb928b5af626420a06774&amp;id=61ec7d2d21|website=London Design Festival|publisher=London Design Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over 2,000 international design businesses took part in the 2017 London Design Festival including exhibitors at five Design Destinations: 100% Design, Decorex International, designjunction, Focus/18, and [[London Design Fair]] (previously known as ''Tent London'').

In 2018 ten Design Districts will participate in the Festival - Bankside, Brompton, Clerkenwell, Fitzrovia, Marylebone, Mayfair, Pimlico Road, Regent St &amp; St James's, Shoreditch and West Kensington - offering a programme of events, [[exhibitions]], talks and tours. 

The V&amp;A Museum is the official residency and hub of the Festival, with 2018 seeing the celebration of 10 years in partnership together.

==  Location  == 
[[File:You Know You Cannot See Yourself So Well As By Reflection.png|thumb|300px|'You Know You Cannot See Yourself So Well As By Reflection' at the V&amp;A, 2015.]]
Since 2009 the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] has acted as the central Hub location for the London Design Festival.

In 2017, London Design Festival helped drive a total of 173,250 visits to the V&amp;A over the Festival period with 22% of those surveyed saying they had never visited the museum before and were driven there by the Festival. Flynn Talbot’s Reflection Room and Ross Lovegrove’s Transmission installations were particularly popular.

For the nine days of the Festival, visitors to the V&amp;A will explore a range of special displays and installations throughout the museum, complemented by an extensive programme of events, daily tours, and workshops from Global Design Forum, which in 2017 drew 45 speakers from 13 countries, and 2,800 visitors.

Celebrating ten years with the V&amp;A as the official London Design Festival hub, this unique collaboration sees iconic spaces within the Museum transformed each year by an extraordinary collection of specially-commissioned installations and displays by international contemporary designers.

== Awards ==
[[File:British Land Celebration of Design Winners 2015.png|thumb|right|300px|Winners of the British Land Celebration of Design 2015.]]
Each year a Jury composed of established designers, industry commentators and previous winners choose recipients of ''The [[British Land]] Celebration of Design'' across four categories. Winners are chosen from a wide range of design disciplines and awards for their exceptional contribution to their field.

The London Design Medal categories include:
* Panerai London Design Medal
* Design Innovation Medal
* Emerging Talent Medal
* Lifetime Achievement Medal

“While there are no shortage of design awards, we wanted to do it differently: not just a big dinner that everyone has to buy tables for,” says Festival Director Ben Evans. “So we took the Nobel Prize route – there’s no shortlist, just a winner. So that means there’s no losers either.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Ben|title=British Land Celebration of Design|url=http://www.londondesignfestival.com/british-land-celebration-of-design-2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317051440/http://www.londondesignfestival.com/british-land-celebration-of-design-2015|archivedate=2016-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London Design Medal is designed each year by jewellery designer Hannah Martin. The medals feature a London bird, the Cockney Sparrow, in flight. Previous winners include [[Ken Adam|Sir Ken Adam]], [[Peter Saville (graphic designer)|Peter Saville]], [[Marc Newson]], [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Sir Paul Smith]], Dame [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Thomas Heatherwick]], [[Sir Terence Conran]] and [[Ron Arad (industrial designer)|Ron Arad.]]

'''Melodifestivalen 2009''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] song contest held between February and March 2009. It was the selection for the 49th song to represent [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest]], and was the 48th edition of [[Melodifestivalen]]. Five semi-finals were held in the Swedish cities of [[Gothenburg]], [[Skellefteå]], [[Leksand]] and [[Malmö]], with [[Norrköping]] hosting the final ''Andra Chansen'' (Second Chance) round.

After the five semi-finals 11 songs had qualified to the final of the contest, contested in the Swedish capital of [[Stockholm]], at the [[Ericsson Globe|Globe Arena]]. After the voting of 12 juries and a public televote had been revealed, the final winner was [[opera]] singer [[Malena Ernman]] with pop/opera song "[[La voix (song)|La voix]]", which received top marks from the public televote, despite only placing eighth after the votes of the 12 juries.

The 2009 edition of Melodifestivalen implemented a number of new rules which changed the dynamics of the contest, including an increase in the number of people allowed on stage, the allowance of pre-recorded backing vocals, and a new international jury who selected an eleventh finalist, and voted in the final.

==Rules==
{{See also|History of Melodifestivalen|Voting at Melodifestivalen}}
The current rules for Melodifestivalen were first implemented in [[Melodifestivalen 2002|2002]] – the format consists of five semi-finals held every year: the first four semi-finals each consist of eight songs, in which the top two songs directly qualify to the final of the contest, while the third and fourth-placed songs qualify to the final semi-final, the ''Andra Chansen'' (Second Chance) round. Eight songs compete in the Second Chance round, competing in a knock-out format until two songs are left, which qualify to the final. These songs are chosen by a public televote held on the night of the contest. The final consisted of 10 songs, who are awarded marks by 11 regional juries of Sweden, alongside televoting, with each constituting 50% of the total result.&lt;ref name="Rules EBU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=1240|title=Swedish national final to change!|last=Schacht|first=Andreas|date=2008-08-26|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

28 songs are selected from a public call for songs by SVT. These are chosen from a large number of entries, with over 3000 entries being received by SVT in past contests. These songs are reduced by the Swedish Music Publishers Association (''Svenska musikförläggareföreningen''; SMFF), who reduce this large number to around 1200 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=3969 |title=One month left for Melodifestivalen entries |last=Fisher |first=Luke |date=2008-08-25 |publisher=''Oikotimes'' |accessdate=2008-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301050602/http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=3969 |archivedate=2009-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sixteen-person jury reduce this number once again to the final 28 competing songs. These 28 songs are then joined by compositions by four songwriters invited by SVT, who each submit a song into the competition.

For the 2009 contest a number of changes were implemented to this format: the first four semi-finals now include a duel format, with the top four songs competing against each other for a place in the final - the 1st and 4th-placed songs and the 2nd and 3rd-placed songs battled against each other, with the winning songs, as decided by another public televote, qualifying to the final, while the losing songs take part in the Second Chance round.&lt;ref name="Rules EBU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.104594/1.1416221/regler_-_nytt_for_i_ar |title=Regler - nytt för i år |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=2009-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526215927/http://svt.se/2.104594/1.1416221/regler_-_nytt_for_i_ar |archivedate=2009-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2009 contest a maximum of eight people were allowed on stage, an increase from the previous maximum of six. As well as this pre-recorded backing vocals were now allowed to be included on the songs' backing tracks, however the main vocals were still required to be performed on stage.&lt;ref name="Rules EBU" /&gt;

This year also marked the introduction of an "international jury". The jury consists of 12 members, who all work within the music industry, with many involved in Eurovision.&lt;ref name="IJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.104594/1.1444596/internationella_juryn_-_ny_for_i_ar |title=Internationella juryn - ny för i år |date=2009-02-14 |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |accessdate=2009-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525185929/http://svt.se/2.104594/1.1444596/internationella_juryn_-_ny_for_i_ar |archivedate=2009-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The international jury selected one song from each semi-final that did not qualify to the final, focusing their decision on their suitability for Eurovision. After the Second Chance round had finished, the jury selected their preferred song from the remaining entries, which qualified to the final, becoming the 11th finalist. The international jury also voted during the final of the contest, becoming the 12th jury, alongside the 11 regional juries of Sweden.&lt;ref name="Rules EBU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new" /&gt;

The logo for the Contest, the now-familiar five spotlights, has not been altered since its interception in 2002, and remained in use for the 2009 Contest. The first details of the stage for this year's contest were released on 29 January 2009, a week before the first semi-final in Gothenburg. The first plans of the stage were made during the summer of 2008 and was, for the third time, designed by [[Viktor Brattström]], with the intention to provide a feeling of endlessness: "The audience will get the feeling of not knowing where the stage starts or ends, not knowing what's coming up around the corner".&lt;ref name="visual1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/13075|title=Sweden: Melodifestivalen - Fantasy and movement|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2009-01-29|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="visual2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=79613&amp;a=1424444&amp;lid=puff_1424493&amp;lpos=lasMer |title=Det blir extravaganza i år |date=2009-01-29 |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=2009-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201135905/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=79613&amp;a=1424444&amp;lid=puff_1424493&amp;lpos=lasMer |archivedate=2009-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The green room, where the artists rested after their performances, was altered from previous contests. Instead of competing artists and composers sitting together at tables, artists sat together on sofas beside the stage, while composers sat together in the front rows of the audience.&lt;ref name="visual1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="visual2" /&gt;

===Wild cards===
The wild card (''joker'') system was introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured in the competition.&lt;ref name="2007faq"&gt;[http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=64781&amp;lid=puff_759306&amp;lpos=extra_0 Melodifestivalen 2007—FAQ in English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226155242/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=64781&amp;lid=puff_759306&amp;lpos=extra_0 |date=2009-02-26 }}. SVT.se. Retrieved on 1 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Four artists, one in each semifinal, are invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules.

In a change from previous years, the names of the wild card entries were released alongside the submitted entries instead of the usual method of releasing the wild cards after the other 28 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12531 |title=Melodifestivalen: 1st wildcard announced tomorrow |last=Viniker |first=Barry |date=2008-11-18 |publisher=ESCToday |accessdate=2008-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109181856/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12531 |archivedate=2009-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first wild card entry was released on 19 November, with Melodifestivalen producer [[Christer Björkman]], Jennifer Brown and Måns Zelmerlöw featuring on ''Godmorgon Sverige''.

The four semi-finals were held between 7 and 28 February, with the Second Chance round being held on 7 March.

===Semi-final 1===
The first semi-final was held on 7 February at the [[Scandinavium]] in [[Gothenburg]].

The show began with host [[Petra Mede]] introducing the eight competing acts, with a number of skits being shown with former winners [[Charlotte Perrelli]] and [[Martin Stenmarck]].

The first song on stage was [[Nina Söderquist]] with "Tick Tock", a powerful rock song. Söderquist performed in a black leather outfit, joined by four male backing dancers and two male backing singers, all in black. Fire was used frequently during the performance. Second on stage was [[Jonathan Fagerlund]], performing "[[Welcome to My Life (Jonathan Fagerlund song)|Welcome to My Life]]". Fagerlund, dressed in a grey top and jeans, was joined on stage by an all-female backing band for his performance of the light pop/rock song. Next on stage was [[Melodifestivalen 2004]] runner-up [[Shirley Clamp]], performing the first [[Swedish language]] song of the contest, "Med hjärtat fyllt av ljus" (With my heart full of light). Clamp performed the ballad alone on stage, dressed in a long blue dress. The stage was also bathed in blue light, and wind machines were later used in the performance. The fourth act on stage was [[dansband]] the Scotts, performing "Jag tror på oss" (I believe in us). The quartet, performing in black and silver suits, were joined by three female backing singers, dressed in short black dresses.&lt;ref name="semi1ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/13187|title=Sweden: Melodifestivalen 2009 First Heat|last=Lewis|first=Daniel|date=2009-02-07|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="semi1ref2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5046 |title=Sweden: Live from Gothenburg, the first Melodifestivalen semifinal |last=Konstantopoulos |first=Fotis |date=2009-02-07 |publisher=''Oikotimes'' |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211131637/http://oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5046 |archivedate=2009-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="semi1ref3"&gt;''Melodifestivalen 2009: Semi-final 1''.

The fifth act on stage was [[Emilia Rydberg|Emilia]], singing "[[You're My World (Emilia Rydberg song)|You're My World]]", an up-tempo pop song with jazz elements. Emilia was dressed in a sparkling gold dress, joined on stage by four female backing singers, a pianist, drummer and bassist, all dressed in [[Big band]] era inspired outfits. Pyrotechnics were later used towards the end of the song. Next on stage was twice third-placers [[Alcazar (band)|Alcazar]], composed of [[Andreas Lundstedt]], [[Therese Merkel|Tess Merkel]] and [[Lina Hedlund]]. Their song "[[Stay the Night (Alcazar song)|Stay the Night]]", a energetic disco song, began with violet light shining on the band members, dressed in pink and blue. The group were joined by three backing dancers, with dancing featured throughout the song by the trio. The penultimate song was [[Caroline af Ugglas]] with "Snälla snälla" (Please, please), an emotional ballad. Caroline, dressed in a short white dress with bright blue [[Wellington boot|wellies]], gave an emotional performance, with anger and frustration prominent. Last on stage was the semi-finals wild card entry, [[Marie Serneholt]] with "Disconnect Me". Serneholt performed the energetic pop song in a short white dress, joined by four male dancers, and later by two female backing singers, all in black.&lt;ref name="semi1ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="semi1ref2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="semi1ref3" /&gt;

==International Jury==
[[File:Caroline Af Ugglas.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Caroline af Ugglas]], performing "Snälla snälla".]]
The international jury had the task of selecting a song from each heat which they think was the most suitable for the Eurovision Song Contest. The jury were only able to pick songs that had not passed to the final. If they pick a song which qualifies to the final through the Second Chance round, that song became ineligible for the jury's choice. The international jury were also given the right to vote during the final of the contest, becoming the 12th jury, alongside the 11 regional juries.&lt;ref name="Rules EBU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IJ" /&gt;

The first song to receive the international jury wildcard was [[Caroline af Ugglas]], who passed to Second Chance from the Gothenburg heat on 7 February with "Snälla, snälla". [[Amy Diamond]] was the second qualifier, however, shortly after the show it was rumoured that the announcement of Diamond as the jury choice was incorrect, and that the true choice was [[Jennifer Brown (singer)|Jennifer Brown]], who had placed 7th in the televote. This rumour however was revealed to be false by SVT, with Diamond as the correct choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5127 |title=False rumours about Melodifestivalen error |last=van Tongeren |first=Mario |date=2009-02-15 |publisher=''Oikotimes'' |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331225536/http://oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5127 |archivedate=2009-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leksand wildcard selected was [[Sofia (Swedish singer)|Sofia]] with "Alla". This song was the only jury wilcard selected that failed to qualify to Second Chance, coming 7th in the televote.&lt;ref name="semi3results1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="semi3results2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5213 |title=A Swedish who sings in Greek |last=Fantis |first=Giorgos |date=2009-02-21 |publisher=''Oikotimes'' |accessdate=2009-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228101641/http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5213 |archivedate=2009-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final wildcard, coming from the Malmö qualifier, was [[Sarah Dawn Finer]] with "Moving On", another Second Chance qualifier.&lt;ref name="semi4results1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="semi4results2" /&gt;

As Sarah Dawn Finer and Caroline af Ugglas had qualified from the Second Chance round to the final this made them ineligible to be chosen for the international jury qualifier. This left two songs left to compete for the 11th final place: either [[Amy Diamond]], who had already been knocked out of Second Chance in the first round, or [[Sofia (Swedish singer)|Sofia]]. The final choice by the jury was for Sofia with "Alla".&lt;ref name="acresults1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="acresults2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="acresults3" /&gt;

==Final==
The final of Melodifestivalen 2009 was held at the [[Ericsson Globe|Globen]] arena in [[Stockholm]] on 14 March 2009.

The run-up to the final began shortly after the [[#Second Chance|Second Chance]] round had been completed, when the running order for the final was revealed – [[#Semi-final 2|semi-final 2]] qualifier [[Måns Zelmerlöw]] would open proceeding on the night, while [[#Semi-final 4|semi-final 4]] qualifier and wild card [[Malena Ernman]] would finish the performances for the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.79613/1.1471775/startordning_melodifestivalfinalen_2009?lid=senasteNytt_741385&amp;lpos=rubrik_1471775 |title=Startordning Melodifestivalfinalen 2009 |date=2009-03-08 |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613005125/http://svt.se/2.79613/1.1471775/startordning_melodifestivalfinalen_2009?lid=senasteNytt_741385&amp;lpos=rubrik_1471775 |archivedate=2011-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The favourites to win the contest were Zelmerlöw and Ernman, with the [[#International Jury|international jury]] wild card [[Sofia (Swedish singer)|Sofia]] predicted as most likely to finish last, according to [[bookmaker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5328 |title=Malena and Måns favourites across the board |last=Fisher |first=Luke |date=2009-03-14 |publisher=''Oikotimes'' |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418055429/http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5328 |archivedate=2009-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Måns Zelmerlöw took the stage first on the night, repeating his performance from the semi-final of "[[Hope &amp; Glory (song)|Hope &amp; Glory]]". Second Chance qualifier [[Caroline af Ugglas]] followed Zelmerlöw on stage with "Snälla snälla", repeating her emotional performance alone on stage. [[Agnes Carlsson|Agnes]] was next on stage, performing "[[Love Love Love (Agnes song)|Love Love Love]]", now with a new hairstyle, but no major changes were made to the performance since the semi-final. [[H.E.A.T]] followed with their rock song "1000 Miles", who were then followed by [[Emilia Rydberg|Emilia]] with "You're My World".&lt;ref name="finalref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/13517 |title=Live: National final in Sweden |last=Klier |first=Marcus |date=2009-03-14 |publisher=ESCToday |accessdate=2009-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317055628/http://esctoday.com/news/read/13517 |archivedate=2009-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finalref2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5331|title=Live from Stockholm, Melodifestivalen Final|last=Fisher|first=Luke|date=2009-03-14|publisher=''Oikotimes''|accessdate=2009-03-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317072517/http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=5331|archivedate=2009-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finalref3"&gt;''Melodifestivalen 2009: Final''.

Two-time participant [[Alcazar (band)|Alcazar]] were the sixth act to take the stage at Globen, performing disco/pop number "[[Stay the Night (Alcazar song)|Stay the Night]]", who were followed by the second Second Chance qualifier [[Sarah Dawn Finer]], performing "Moving On". Boyband [[E.M.D.]], now performing in white tuxedos, were eighth on stage with "[[Baby Goodbye (E.M.D. song)|Baby Goodbye]]". International jury selection [[Sofia (Swedish singer)|Sofia]] followed on stage, singing the Greek ethno number "[[Alla (song)|Alla]]". She was followed by 16-year-old [[Molly Sandén]] with "[[Så vill stjärnorna]]", and finally by [[Malena Ernman]] with "[[La voix]]".&lt;ref name="finalref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="finalref2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="finalref3" /&gt;

At the final vote [[Malena Ernman]] was the winner: despite only coming 8th in the jury vote, she was able to win the televote and guarantee victory with "[[La voix]]". The runner-up was Caroline af Ugglas with "Snälla snälla", while [[E.M.D.]] came third with "[[Baby Goodbye (E.M.D. song)|Baby Goodbye]]".

===Voting===
The voting in the final was made up of both televoting/SMS voting and jury voting. 12 juries – 11 regional juries from around Sweden, along with the international jury – gave 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 points to their favourite songs. This was joined by televoting, with the total votes being converted into a set number of points – 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 points were given to the most-popular songs of the total televote from around Sweden.

The International jury results were announced immediately after all the entries were performed, while the televoting was still taking place. These results were announced on stage by [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] winner and International Jury member [[Marija Šerifović]].

[[Måns Zelmerlöw]] was the favourite with the juries, receiving a total of 96 points. [[Sarah Dawn Finer]] came second with the juries, gaining 75 points, while [[Alcazar (band)|Alcazar]] came third with 67. However the televoting completely contradicted this, with the televoting favourite [[Malena Ernman]] coming only eighth in the jury vote, while runner-up [[Caroline af Ugglas]] came only 5th in the jury.

==Relationship==
Shana had met Michael Lane in 2015 when they both worked at Brighton Fire Alarms.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/shana-grice-murder-latest-michael-lane-guity-ex-boyfriend-teenager-lewes-crown-court-sussex-police-a7643666.html|title=Shana Grice: Ex-boyfriend found guilty of murdering teenager after police fined her for wasting their time|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=22 March 2017|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane was from Thornhill Road, Portslade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-39331297|title=Shana Grice murder trial: Accused 'lied repeatedly'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=20 March 2017|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formed a relationship and Lane had become obsessed with her.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; He refused to accept the breakup and said to a friend “She’ll pay for what she’s done."&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt;
==Stalking==
Michael Lane stalked her after she broke up with him and returned to her previous boyfriend, Ashley Cooke.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; Lane put a tracker device on her car which notified via his mobile phone every time the car moved.&lt;ref name=guardian-shana-grice-trial-judge-criticises-sussex-police-for-failing-her/&gt;

On 8 February 2016, Grice complained to police about being stalked by Lane after receiving unwanted flowers and damage to her car.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-timeline-of-stalking-and-abuse&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-39268428|title=Shana Grice murder: Jury hears timeline of 'stalking and abuse'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=14 March 2017|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt;

On 24 March, Lane snatched her phone and grabbed her hair.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-timeline-of-stalking-and-abuse/&gt; He was arrested on suspicion of assault but later released and Grice was issued with a fixed penalty notice by the police for wasting their time by not disclosing she had been in a relationship with him.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-timeline-of-stalking-and-abuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-shana-grice-trial-judge-criticises-sussex-police-for-failing-her/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt;

On 9 July, Lane used a stolen key to let himself into her home and watch her while she was apparently sleeping.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-timeline-of-stalking-and-abuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; She was actually awake, had heard his footsteps and hid under the duvet.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; She heard a man breathing in her room.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; Shortly afterwards, the man left, and when Grice looked out her window she saw Lane walking away.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; He was arrested for theft, given a police caution and told to stay away from Shana.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-timeline-of-stalking-and-abuse/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt;

The following day, she received around seven phone calls from a blocked number, including one with heavy breathing.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; She was told there were no further lines of inquiry and the case would be left on file.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt;

On 12 July, she reported to police that she was being followed by Lane.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; Police treated the case as "low risk", but that the investigating officer would be made aware.

On 4 August, she saw Lane loitering outside her home.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; She confided in her friend Joann Pumphrey that she was afraid that police wouldn't believe her because of her previous fine for wasting police time.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; Although Joann was a witness to this, Shana didn't report the incident to the police.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt;

==Murder==
On 25 August, Lane waited until Grice was alone at home, then let himself in, slit her throat and set fire to her bedroom.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; She was just 19 years old at the time of her murder and her killer was 27 years old.&lt;ref name=guardian-shana-grice-trial-judge-criticises-sussex-police-for-failing-her/&gt; Her body was found by Ian Cooke, her boyfriends' father, in her home at Chrisdory Road, [[Portslade]], [[East Sussex]].&lt;ref name=guardian-shana-grice-trial-judge-criticises-sussex-police-for-failing-her/&gt;

Michael Lane was arrested the same day at his then workplace in [[Burgess Hill]].&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; He initially lied to police about his movements that day, before admitting that he had gone to Shana Grices' home.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; He claimed that he had found the front door open, then found Shanas' body in her bedroom.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; He claimed that he panicked, then left the scene without dialling 999, checking Shanas' vital signs or telling his family what he had found.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt; He claimed that he only kept quiet about what he had seen because he was afraid of being accused of her murder.&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-guilty/&gt;

==Trial==
The trial lasted two weeks in [[Lewes Crown Court]].&lt;ref name=guardian-shana-grice-trial-judge-criticises-sussex-police-for-failing-her/&gt; After being found guilty Lane was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 25 years.&lt;ref name=guardian-shana-grice-trial-judge-criticises-sussex-police-for-failing-her/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Shana Grices' parents Sharon Grice and Richard Green said their daughter would still be alive if [[Sussex Police]] had acted on her complaints.&lt;ref name=guardian-shana-grice-trial-judge-criticises-sussex-police-for-failing-her/&gt; The judge, Justice Green, also criticised police.&lt;ref name=guardian-shana-grice-trial-judge-criticises-sussex-police-for-failing-her/&gt; During sentencing he said "There was seemingly no appreciation on the part of those investigating that a young woman in a sexual relationship with a man could at one and the same time be vulnerable and at risk of serious harm. The police jumped to conclusions and Shana was stereotyped."&lt;ref name=guardian-shana-grice-trial-judge-criticises-sussex-police-for-failing-her/&gt;

Sussex Police apologised to Shanas' parents and referred themselves to the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]], which has launched an inquiry.&lt;ref name=guardian-shana-grice-trial-judge-criticises-sussex-police-for-failing-her/&gt;

In late April 2017, Sussex Police accepted six recommendations from the IPCC to improve the way the force dealt with stalking.&lt;ref name=bbc-shana-grice-killer-stalked-13-more-women&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-39745848|title=Shana Grice killer Michael Lane 'stalked 13 more women|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-sussex-police&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/shana-grace-sussex-police-stalker-girl-murdered-boyfriend-waste-police-time-watchdog-criticise-a7708006.html|title=A teenager was murdered by ex-boyfriend after police fined her for wasting their time.

Sussex police also revealed that Michael Lane had been the subject of complaints from 13 other women.&lt;ref name=bbc-shana-grice-killer-stalked-13-more-women/&gt; Most of the complaints related to the three years before Shana Grices' murder, except for one which dealt with the ten years before her murder.&lt;ref name=bbc-shana-grice-killer-stalked-13-more-women/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent-shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-ex-boyfriend-stalking-other-women&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/shana-grice-murder-michael-lane-ex-boyfriend-stalking-other-women-sussex-police-ipcc-a7709636.html|title=Ex-boyfriend who murdered Shana Grice 'stalked 13 other young women and girls but police took no action'|publisher=[[The Independent]]|last=Roberts|first=Rachael|date=29 April 2017|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Sister Eileen''''' is an [[United States|American]] comedy stage production, written by [[Joseph A. Fields]] and [[Jerome Chodorov]], based on [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] short stories by [[Ruth McKenney]]. The stories were originally published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and then collected and published as the book ''My Sister Eileen'' (1938).

The plot focuses on Ruth and Eileen Sherwood, sisters from Ohio who relocate to [[New York City]] in search of fame and fortune. Witty Ruth aspires to be a published writer, while pretty Eileen dreams of success as an actress. Their financial circumstances force them to rent a dingy basement studio apartment in a [[Greenwich Village]] building owned by Mr. Appolpolous, one of many colorful characters who cross their path.

The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway production]], produced by [[Max Gordon (producer)|Max Gordon]] and directed by [[George S. Kaufman]], opened 26 December 1940 at the [[Samuel J. Friedman Theatre|Biltmore Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/reference/theatre_info/2151.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060412000414/http://www.playbill.com/reference/theatre_info/2151.html |archivedate=2006-04-12 |df= }} ''Samuel J. Friedman Theatre (Broadway)''&lt;/ref&gt; It transferred three times during its run of 864 performances: to the [[Al Hirschfeld Theatre|Martin Beck Theatre]], opening 4 August 1942; to the [[Walter Kerr Theatre|Ritz Theatre]], opening 23 November 1942; and to [[The Broadway Theatre]], opening 13 December 1942.

The original cast included [[Shirley Booth]] as Ruth Sherwood, [[Jo Ann Sayers]] as Eileen Sherwood, [[Morris Carnovsky]] as Mr. Appolpolous, and [[Richard Quine]] as Frank Lippencott, a drugstore [[soda jerk]] with an eye for Eileen. [[Peggy Knudsen]] replaced Sayers in June 1942 (when she left to be married), and Quine was replaced by [[Henry Jones (actor)|Henry Jones]], who in turn was replaced by [[Max Showalter]].

[[Eileen McKenney]], an executive assistant to [[Walt Disney]] and the inspiration for the play's title character, and her husband, novelist and screenwriter [[Nathanael West]], were killed in an automobile accident in [[El Centro, California]] four days before the Broadway opening (they were driving to the Los Angeles Airport to board a plane for New York, to attend the play's premiere).  Her sister Ruth consequently did not attend the premiere and never saw the play.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/21/realestate/sister-eileen-to-daughter-eileen-a-state-judge.html ''New York Times'', 21 December 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fields and Chodorov adapted their play for the [[My Sister Eileen (1942 film)|1942 film]] that opened while the play was still running on Broadway, as well as the 1953 [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Wonderful Town]]''. It also served as the basis for the 1960 [[My Sister Eileen (TV series)|television sitcom of the same title]].

The Declaration "'''On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia'''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=75539&amp;mode=DOC Latvijas Padomju Sociālistiskās Republikas – Augstākās Padomes Deklarācija: Par Latvijas Republikas neatkarības atjaunošanu]. Likumi – Latvijas Republikas Tiesību Akti.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-lv|Deklarācija par Latvijas Republikas neatkarības atjaunošanu}}) was adopted on 4 May 1990, by the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia|Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR]]. The Declaration stated that, although Latvia had ''[[de facto]]'' lost its independence in 1940, when it was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]], the country had ''[[de jure]]'' remained a sovereign country as the annexation had been unconstitutional and against the will of the people of [[Latvia]]. Therefore it resolved that the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and the [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940]] were illegal, and annulled the declaration on the accession of Latvia to the Soviet Union of 21 July 1940, re-instituted the [[Constitution of Latvia]] of 1922, which was thereupon partly suspended, and set a period of transition to ''de facto'' independence, which would end upon the first session of [[Saeima]]. It also ruled that during the transitional period the Constitution of the Latvian SSR and other laws would remain applicable as long as they did not contradict articles 1, 2, 3 and 6 of the Constitution of Latvia, which were reinforced by the declaration. It was provided that a committee to elaborate a new edition of the [[Constitution of Latvia]] should be created. Social, economic, cultural and political rights were granted to citizens and residents of Latvia in accordance with international [[human rights]]. The declaration also stated that Latvia would form its relationship with the Soviet Union on the basis of the [[Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty]] of 1920, in which the Soviet Union had recognized the independence of Latvia as inviolable "for all future time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Overview==
===Historical and juridical background===
In its beginning the Declaration establishes several historical facts and on the basis of these facts concludes that the Republic of Latvia ''de jure'' is a sovereign country. It observes that the Republic of Latvia proclaimed independence on 18 November 1918, and was internationally recognized in 1920, and that Latvia was admitted to membership in the [[League of Nations]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="dec"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first country to recognize the independence of Latvia ''de jure'' was [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] on 11 August 1920, when the Soviet-Latvian Peace treaty was signed (it is generally considered that the independence of Latvia ''de jure'' was internationally recognized on 26 January 1921, when it was recognized by the [[Allies of World War I]]).&lt;ref name="Freibergs J."&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration notes that in April 1920 the Latvian nation followed the principle of [[self-determination]] by electing a [[Constitutional Assembly of Latvia]], which adopted the [[Constitution of Latvia]] on 15 February 1922, in general, equal and direct elections, based on [[proportional representation]].&lt;ref name="dec"/&gt;

On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and [[Nazi Germany]] signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which included a secret protocol dividing [[Eastern Europe]] into [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. Latvia was apportioned to the Soviet sphere and on 5 October 1939, signed a mutual assistance pact. On 16 June 1940, the Soviet Union issued an [[ultimatum]] to Latvia accusing it of not carrying out the treaty, namely of forming a [[Baltic Entente|military alliance against the USSR]], and requested a new government to be formed and to guarantee Soviet military free entrance in Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.historia.lv/alfabets/L/la/okupac/dokumenti/1940.06.16.ultim.htm
|title= Ultimatum of Soviet government to Latvian government
|accessdate= 2008-01-05
|date= 1940-06-16
|language= Latvian
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latvian government decided to give in to the ultimatum and on 17 June 1940, Soviet forces entered Latvia.&lt;ref name="Freibergs J."/&gt; The Declaration states that the Soviet ultimatum and military aggression on 17 June 1940, should be viewed as an international crime, which led to the occupation of Latvia and loss of its sovereignty and points out that the new government was formed as dictated by the [[Soviet Union]] and by [[international law]] should not be viewed as executive of Latvia as it represented Soviet, not Latvian, interests.&lt;ref name="dec"/&gt;

On 14–15 July 1940 a [[parliament]] called the "People's Saeima of Latvia" was elected, which on 21 July 1940, declared accession to the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Freibergs J."/&gt; The declaration states that the election of the People's Saeima took place on the basis of unconstitutional and illegally adopted election law in a state of political terror and notes that out of 17 lists submitted for the [[election]] only one was allowed to participate in the [[election]], which had not stated prior to the election that Soviet power should be established in Latvia and it should join the [[Soviet Union]] and that results of the [[election]] were falsified. The declaration observes that the People's Saeima was formed by misleading the people and therefore did not express the sovereign will of people of Latvia. It also notes that the People's Saeima had no right to change the [[political system]] in Latvia and liquidate its sovereignty as only the people have such right and the issue was never submitted to a national referendum. Therefore the Declaration rules that, in accordance with [[international law]], the annexation of [[Latvia]] to the Soviet Union was not valid and the Republic of Latvia is still ''de jure'' subject to international [[law]] as recognized by more than 50 countries.&lt;ref name="dec"/&gt;

===Basis===
After concluding that the Republic of Latvia ''de jure'' is a sovereign country the Declaration makes note of previously adopted documents and explains that the Supreme Soviet is acting according to the will of inhabitants of Latvia. First it notes two previous declarations of the Supreme Soviet — "On sovereignty of state of Latvia" of 28 July 1989, which declared that the Latvian SSR will act as a sovereign state and that laws adopted by the Soviet Union will come in force in the territory of Latvian SSR only if the Supreme Soviet has ratified them and "In question of independence of Latvia" of 15 February 1990, in which the Supreme Soviet condemns declaration "On accession of Latvia to Soviet Union" of 21 July 1940, however none of these explicitly called for secession from the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly it notes Appeal of All-Latvian congress of people deputies of 21 April 1990, which called for restoration of independence. Then it is stated that the Supreme Soviet is acting in accordance with the will of inhabitants of Latvia, which had been clearly expressed by electing as a majority those deputies, who had stated that they will restore independence of the Republic of Latvia in their reelection programme.&lt;ref name="dec"/&gt;

=== Act ===
After establishing that the Republic of Latvia ''de jure'' is a sovereign country and that by the will of its people it should be independent, the Supreme Soviet ruled:&lt;br /&gt;
1. To recognize the priority of international laws over national laws. To hold to be illegitimate the treaty between the USSR and Germany of 23 August 1939, and the consequent liquidation of independence of Latvia resulting from Soviet military aggression on 17 June 1940.&lt;br /&gt;
2. To proclaim the declaration "On accession of Latvia to Soviet Union" of 21 July 1940, to be void from the moment of adoption.&lt;br /&gt;
3. To re-establish the authority of the [[Constitution of Latvia]]. The official name of the state of Latvia is the Republic of Latvia, in short Latvia.&lt;br /&gt;
4. To suspend the Constitution of Latvia until a new edition is adopted, except for the articles, which in accordance with the 77 article of the Constitution can only be amended if submitted to a national referendum:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. ''Latvia is an independent democratic republic.''&lt;br/&gt;2. ''The sovereign power of the State of Latvia is vested in the people of Latvia.''&lt;br/&gt;3. ''The territory of the State of Latvia, within the borders established by international agreements, consists of [[Vidzeme]], [[Latgale]], [[Courland|Kurzeme]] and [[Semigallia|Zemgale]].''&lt;br/&gt;6. ''The Saeima shall be elected in general, equal and direct elections, and by secret ballot based on proportional representation.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Article 6 shall be applied when the governmental institutions of independent Latvia have been restored, which grant free elections.&lt;br /&gt;
5. To set a period of transition to de facto independence until the first session of the new Saeima. During the transitional period the highest power of the state shall be the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia]].&lt;br /&gt;
6. During the transitional period the Constitution of the Latvian SSR and other laws of the Latvian SSR in force at the time when the declaration was made may be applicable as long as they do not contradict articles 1, 2, 3 and 6 of the Constitution of Latvia. Disputes over the applicability of laws shall be resolved by the Constitutional Court. During the transitional period laws shall be made or amended only by the Supreme Council.&lt;br /&gt;
7. To constitute a committee, which will elaborate a new edition of the Constitution of Latvia, suitable to the current political, economic and social state of Latvia.&lt;br /&gt;
8. In accordance with international [[human rights]], to grant social, economic and cultural rights, as well as political freedoms, to the citizens of Latvia and other countries, who reside in the territory of Latvia. This shall fully apply to those citizens of the Soviet Union who chose to reside in Latvia without its citizenship.&lt;br /&gt;
9. To build Latvian-Soviet relationships upon the Latvian-Soviet peace treaty of 11 August 1920, in which the Soviet Union recognizes eternal independence for Latvia and which is still in force. To constitute a committee for negotiations with USSR.&lt;ref name="dec"/&gt;

==Adoption== 
The Supreme Soviet was [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1990|elected on 18 March 1990]]; it was the first election in Soviet Latvia in which multiple parties were allowed to participate. 201 deputies were elected.&lt;ref name="Supreme Soviet"&gt;{{cite web

==Response==
On 4 May 1990, after the declaration was adopted, the [[Communist Party of Latvia]] resolved that it was unconstitutional, contained notable contradictions and historical inaccuracies, and noted that such issues should be decided by referendum. The Communist Party deemed that the declaration might trigger the [[President of the Soviet Union]] to take countermeasures, therefore the party should launch a propaganda campaign against the declaration and ask the President of the Soviet Union to annul the declaration of the Supreme Soviet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 1990, the President of the Soviet Union [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] issued a decree stating that the declaration violated the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]] and the Constitution of the Latvian SSR and thus stood void from the moment of adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Supreme Council answered that the Constitution of the Soviet Union did not grant the president the right to annul acts adopted by Supreme Soviets of Soviet republics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the Supreme Council announced that the Supreme Soviet, as the legal successor of the People's Saeima, had the right to annul its decisions which contradicted the [[Constitution of Latvia]] which was in force at the time these decisions were made and as the [[1977 Soviet Constitution|Constitution of the Soviet Union]] ruled that the Soviet Union was founded upon principles of [[self-determination]], but Latvia was forcibly annexed, reference to it had no juridical basis regarding the Latvian SSR. 

It also noted that the law of the Soviet Union regarding secession from the Soviet Union to which the decree also referred was not in force in the territory of the Latvian SSR as the Supreme Soviet had not ratified it and that the law contradicted the Constitution of the Soviet Union and the Constitution of Latvian SSR, which provided that Soviet republics can freely secede from the Soviet Union. It was stated that the call for a referendum on secession from the Soviet Union to take place has neither a legal or a political basis, because Latvia had been annexed by the Soviet Union without holding a referendum, which was required by the Constitution of Latvia and Latvia was not seceding from the Soviet Union, but restoring its independence.  

It was noted that the Constitution of the Latvian SSR did not call for a referendum as it had been stated in the decree, but recommended two alternatives – either a referendum or a public debate which had ''de facto'' taken place as it had been discussed in the press and several public opinion polls had taken place showing that a majority of the public supported independence. Similarly in the All-Latvian congress of people deputies of 21 April 1990, 8003 had voted for restoration of independence and the declaration had been adopted by a vote of two thirds of members of the Supreme Soviet which was required for constitutional amendments. Furthermore, the Supreme Council referred to the result of elections of Supreme Soviet as a clear indicator of public opinion that supporters of independence had won the election.  The Supreme Council stated that by 28 May 1990, it had received letters and telegrams from 646,726 residents of the Republic supporting the declaration and only 8,993 people had expressed opposition. Given these provisions, the Supreme Council stated that the Declaration was legitimate and in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Further developments==
On 21 August 1991, during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|Soviet coup d'état attempt]], the Supreme Council adopted a Constitutional law, "On the statehood of the Republic of Latvia", repealing Article 5 of the Declaration, thus ending the transitional period and restoring ''de facto'' independence. However, some elements defining the transitional period remained in force until the first session of the 5th Saeima on 6 July 1993 – The Supreme Council remained the highest power of the state and the constitution was suspended.&lt;ref name="5th saeima"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 July 1990, the Supreme Council formed a work group of 22 deputies, which had to elaborate a new edition of the Constitution before 1 January 1990, though a new edition was never drafted and the Constitution was restored unamended. The Constitutional Court, which was intended to resolve Constitutional disputes during the transitional period, was only founded in 1996. To comply with international human rights as indicated in Article 8, the Supreme Council adopted a declaration of human rights immediately after the Declaration of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''OSAID''' (Ontario Students Against Impaired Driving) is an anti-impaired driving initiative which is found across the province of [[Ontario, Canada]], aimed primarily at youth involvement in combating [[impaired driving]]. It was founded in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://niagara.cioc.ca/record/NIA2481|title=Ontario Students Against Impaired Driving (OSAID)|work=Niagara Community Information Database|accessdate=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and encourages the student population to practice responsible choices and to never to drive while impaired. OSAID chapter members regularly hold awareness raising activities, such as [[mocktail]] sales or events aimed at raising awareness about the dangers of driving while impaired.

OSAID describes itself as: "... a provincial youth driven organization peer education, health promotion and injury prevention program that strives to promote smart healthy choices through education and public awareness to prevent tragedies caused by impaired and [[distracted driving]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OSAID – Ontario Students Against Impaired Driving – Home|url=https://www.osaid.org/|publisher=OSAID|accessdate=20 February 2014|author=&lt;!--staff editor(s);no by-line--&gt;|quote=OSAID is a provincial youth driven organization peer education, health promotion and injury prevention program that strives to promote smart healthy choices through education and public awareness to prevent tragedies caused by impaired and distracted driving.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
OSAID's mission statement, as described in an introductory meeting: "OSAID is about teens helping teens to consider safe alternatives and new perspectives to the perceived norms about [[Alcoholic beverage|Alcohol]], [[Illicit drugs|Illicit Drugs]], and [[Dangerous driving|Dangerous Driving]]."&lt;ref name="Prezi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gandhi|first=Arjun|title=OSAID Introductory Meeting by Arjun Gandhi on Prezi|url=http://prezi.com/9hdmktwijrd2/osaid-introductory-meeting/|work=Prezi.com|publisher=Prezi|date=1 August 2013|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OSAID by the numbers:
* OSAID positively impacts over {{1/2}}&amp;nbsp;million families every year&lt;ref name="Prezi" /&gt;
* OSAID reaches more than 300,000 students annually&lt;ref name="Prezi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MoT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impaired Driving – Programs and Campaigns|url=http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/safety/impaired/programs.shtml|publisher=Ministry of Transportation|accessdate=16 February 2014|date=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OSAID ~ Ontario Students Against Impaired Driving|url=http://www.youthforroadsafety.org/network/organisations/organisations_item/t/osaid_ontario_students_against_impaired_driving|publisher=Youth For Road Safety|accessdate=17 February 2014|author=&lt;!--staff editor(s);no by-line--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The organization was started in 1988 as a collaboration between students, teachers, and police to raise awareness to youth about the dangers of [[driving while impaired]].&lt;ref name="OSAID history"&gt;{{cite web|title=OSAID – Ontairo Students Against Impaired Driving – OSAID History|url=https://www.osaid.org/index.php/osaid-corporate-6/osaid-history.html|publisher=OSAID|accessdate=20 February 2014|author=&lt;!--staff editor(s);no by-line--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the logo was designed and the name ''OSAID'' was chosen.&lt;ref name="OSAID history" /&gt; A newsletter was created and distributed among about 200 students involved with the project.

The organization began holding workshops and launching various media campaigns to get its message out. Scholarships have been awarded to youth shown to be exemplary in raising awareness of driving while under the influence, and continue today.&lt;ref name="OSAID history" /&gt;

=== Media campaigns ===
{{Expand section|1=details about the "Meet the Challenge" project|date = February 2014}}
OSAID's media campaigns have consisted of short films, public service announcements, newsletters, and a DVD. They have received funding by a varying number of organizations, including The Ministry of Transportation, The Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services, The Ministry of Health Promotion and Sport, insurance companies such as OTIP/RAEO (Ontario Teachers' Insurance Plan) and the Ontario Mutual Insurance Association, and individual sponsors to their programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OSAID – Ontairo Students Against Imparied Driving – Sponsors and Supporters|url=https://www.osaid.org/index.php/osaid-corporate-6/sponsors-and-supporters.html|publisher=OSAID|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 a short film entitled ''Life of the Party'' was produced by OSAID and nominated for best short education film at Canada's Short Film Festival,{{thirdparty-inline|date=February 2014}} and in 1996 was selected as one of the top ten videos as a resource for educators by the Driver Education Advisory Committee. [[Public service announcement]]s aired on television in 1991 for six months.&lt;ref name="OSAID history" /&gt; In 1993 [[Ministry of Transportation of Ontario|The Ministry of Transportation]] collaborated in the poster ''Santa Rides with Deers, Not Beers''. OSAID teamed with the Attorney General D/D Countermeasures Office to offer ''Arrive Alive'' video dances in Ontario high schools.

The 2009 [[iDrive]] Road Stories DVD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OSAID – Ontario Students Against Impaired Driving – iDrive Road Stories|url=https://www.osaid.org/index.php/school-events-projects-campaigns-community-connections/idrive-road-stories/idrive-road-stories.html|publisher=OSAID|accessdate=17 February 2014|author=&lt;!--staff editor(s);no by-line--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 23-minute video created to educate youth about safe, sober driving, was produced with input from the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iDRIVE – Transport Canada|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/motorvehiclesafety/roadsafety-1247.htm|publisher=Transport Canada|accessdate=17 February 2014|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OSAID newsletters, such as ''OSAID Speaks'' (began in 2010) have been distributed as an online resource through the OSAID website.

2012's "Meet the Challenge" project, produced in partnership with the [[Ministry of Health Promotion and Sport (Ontario)|Ministry of Health Promotion and Sport]], took place across the province.

OSAID developed and released online cards ("Call Me" cards) to serve as a promise that teens would call a sober driver, if needed, rather than try to drive themselves, with an accompanying contract.

'''''Politian''''' (1835) is the only [[play (theatre)|play]] known to have been written by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], composed in 1835, but [[unfinished work|never completed]].

The play is a fictionalized version of a true event in [[Kentucky]]: the murder of [[Solomon P. Sharp]] by [[Jereboam O. Beauchamp]] in 1825. The so-called "[[Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy|Kentucky Tragedy]]" became a national headline and attracted several fictional representations. Poe, however, chose to set his version in 16th-century [[Rome]]. Poe wrote the play during his time with the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'' and during some personal crises. The first installment of ''Politian'' was published in that journal in December 1835 as "Scenes from an Unpublished Drama". A second installment was issued in January 1836, but the play was never completed.

''Politian'' did not receive good reviews. Its failure prompted Poe to stop writing longer works and instead focus on [[short story|short stories]]. ''Politian'' remains unfinished and is the only play written by Poe.

==Plot summary==
The play takes place in 16th-century [[Rome]]. Castiglione, the son of a duke, becomes engaged to his cousin Alessandra, inciting the jealousy of his father's ward, the orphan Lalage. Lalage meets Politian, the Earl of Leicester, and, after some flirtation, convinces him to take revenge on Castiglione. In the drama, Politian recites the poem "[[Poems by Edgar Allan Poe#The Coliseum (1833)|The Coliseum]]", which Poe had previously published in 1833.

==Analysis==
''Politian'' was written in [[blank verse]]&lt;ref name=Sova197&gt;Sova, 197&lt;/ref&gt; and styled after [[Jacobean era|Jacobean-era]] tragedies.&lt;ref name=Meyers76&gt;Meyers, 76&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of Poe's tales, ''Politian'' questions the finality of death or what happens when life is over. Politian proposes a [[suicide pact]] to an orphan named Lalage so that they can meet in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The title character is named after a 15th-century Italian poet, scholar and teacher named [[Poliziano]].&lt;ref name=Sova197/&gt;

==Inspiration==
[[File:Beauchamp kills Sharp.jpg|thumb|right|''Politian'' is a fictionalized version of a true event known as "The Kentucky Tragedy".]]
Poe was dramatizing a murder which occurred on November 7, 1825, in [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas &amp; Jackson, 65&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Cooke of [[Frankfort, Kentucky]] gave birth to the child of the state [[attorney general|solicitor general]] [[Solomon P. Sharp]] but married [[Jereboam O. Beauchamp]] in 1824. Cooke asked Beauchamp to [[murder]] Sharp as part of the agreement for marriage. He kept his promise, stabbing Sharp to death on November 5, 1825. He pleaded not guilty during his murder trial but was sentenced to be executed. Cooke attempted [[suicide]] by overdosing on [[laudanum]] on the eve of Beauchamp's execution by hanging on July 7, 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Sova, 24&lt;/ref&gt; The story was widely reported in the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Bittner, William. ''Poe: A Biography''. Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1962: 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Poe's story also utilized other real-life historical figures; the [[Earl of Leicester]] stands in as Beauchamp and the character [[Baldassare Castiglione]] represents Sharp.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The true event, labeled "[[Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy|The Kentucky Tragedy]]", was fictionalized in many other works, including ''Conrad and Eudora'' (1834) by [[Thomas Holley Chivers]], ''Beauchampe'' (1842) by [[William Gilmore Simms]], and ''World Enough and Time'' (1950) by [[Robert Penn Warren]].&lt;ref name=Meyers76/&gt; Poe would later fictionalize another murder story that became a national headline in his short story "[[The Mystery of Marie Rogêt]]".&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 183. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and performance history==
Poe met [[John P. Kennedy]], an author himself, very early in his writing career. Kennedy admired Poe's writing and encouraged him and promoted his work to publishers.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 93&lt;/ref&gt; In 1835 Kennedy wrote to the owner of the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'' in [[Richmond, Virginia]]: "He is at work upon a tragedy", and he suggested that Poe be allowed to contribute something to the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Bittner, William. ''Poe: A Biography''. Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1962: 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher, [[Thomas Willis White]], agreed, and Poe's first contribution to the ''Messenger'' was "[[Berenice (short story)|Berenice]]" in April.&lt;ref name=PoeLog149&gt;Thomas &amp; Jackson, 149&lt;/ref&gt; Poe was then hired as a staff writer and critic beginning in August.&lt;ref name=Sova225&gt;Sova, 225&lt;/ref&gt; Between March and November of that year, Poe contributed six new tales as well as the tragedy that Kennedy mentioned, ''Politian''.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 109&lt;/ref&gt;

As ''Politian'' and other works were being prepared for print, Poe had difficulty in wooing his future wife [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]]. Emotionally distressed, he turned to drinking and White fired him in late September 1835.&lt;ref name=Sova225/&gt; White wrote to his friend Lucian Minor, an advocate of [[temperance movement|temperance]]: "[Poe] is unfortunately rather dissipated... He is in addition the victim of melancholy. I should not be at all astonished to hear that he has been guilty of suicide".&lt;ref name=Meyers73&gt;Meyers, 73&lt;/ref&gt; White's exaggeration may have started the rumor amongst literary figures that Poe was not sane.&lt;ref name=Meyers73/&gt; After his dismissal, Poe went to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] with the Clemm family.

White showed sincere concern for Poe's well-being and rehired him in October when Poe's personal crisis had passed. White wrote to Poe, "I should think there was hope of you... If you should come to Richmond again, and again should be an assistant in my office, it must be especially understood by us that all engagements on my part would be dissolved, the moment you get drunk."&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 74&lt;/ref&gt; Poe returned to work in October; his dismissal had caused the cancellation of the October issue of the ''Southern Literary Messenger'' and the November issue was delayed to December.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 108&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this delayed issue that the first installment of ''Politian'' was published under the title "Scenes from an Unpublished Drama".&lt;ref name=PoeLog149/&gt; Another installment was published in January 1836,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas &amp; Jackson, 185&lt;/ref&gt; though it was never fully completed, possibly because he considered the play unsuccessful&lt;ref&gt;Stashower, Daniel. ''The Beautiful Cigar Girl: Mary Rogers, Edgar Allan Poe, and the Invention of Murder''. New York: Dutton, 2006: 245. {{ISBN|0-525-94981-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because Kennedy insisted Poe focus on "drudging upon whatever may make money".&lt;ref name=Peeples29&gt;Peeples, Scott. ''Edgar Allan Poe Revisited''. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1998: 29. {{ISBN|0-8057-4572-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entirety of the unfinished work was included in Poe's collection ''The Raven and Other Poems'' in 1845.&lt;ref name=Sova197/&gt;

Plans were made in 1923 to stage a French translation of ''Politian'' by the [[Grand Guignol]] players; though an article about the project was published in the ''New York Times'', the project was never completed.&lt;ref name="guignol"&gt;{{cite news
|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1923/11/11/archives/a-first-night-for-edgar-allan-poe-his-only-tragedy-never-before.html?sq=poe+politian&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p

==Critical response==
''Politian'' did not get many good reviews. [[Nathaniel Beverley Tucker|Beverley Tucker]] wrote for the ''Washington Telegraph'' that he was disappointed after Poe "had taught us to expect much, for his prose is often very high wrought poetry".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas &amp; Jackson, 187&lt;/ref&gt; One critic for the ''Lynchburg Virginian'' wrote: 
{{quote|"Scenes from Politian", like the prose productions from the same pen (Mr. Poe) evince great powers, wasted on trifles. Why, (to adopt the catechetical style of his own criticism,) why does Mr. Poe throw away his strength on shafts and columns, instead of building a temple to his fame? Can he not execute as well as design?&lt;ref&gt;Thomas &amp; Jackson, 187–188&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Poe biographer Jeffrey Meyers faults Poe for not knowing enough about Renaissance Italy and for presenting a wooden hero in a melodramatic plot in an archaic style which "did not do justice to this tragic story".&lt;ref name=Meyers76/&gt; Despite the play being a tragedy, [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] wrote that "''Politian'' will make you laugh".&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

After reading ''Politian'', Kennedy recommended Poe return to writing poetry and [[short story|short stories]].&lt;ref name=Sova197/&gt; Poe took the advice and went on to focus on shorter works after the failure of both ''Politian'' and his only novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'', which also led to his abandonment of ''[[The Journal of Julius Rodman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 100&lt;/ref&gt; He chose to adapt to the literary marketplace, which then included a bustling newspaper and magazine industry in the 1830s. As Poe described years later, he joined in the effort of "Magazine literature—to the curt, the terse, the well-timed, and the readily diffused, in preference to the old forms of the verbose and ponderous &amp; the inaccessible".&lt;ref name=Peeples29/&gt;

In 1845, Poe accused [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] in print for stealing a quote from ''Politian'' for his own play ''[[The Spanish Student]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Smelser|year=1963|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vbh-AAAAMAAJ|pages=360–362}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such revolutions are usually associated with particular [[nation]]s.

==China==
The [[Generations of Chinese leadership#First generation|first political generation of leaders]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] are part  of the revolutionary generation in China, such as [[Mao Zedong]], [[Zhu De]] and [[Zhou Enlai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mAajBOatchIC|page=34|title=China under Hu Jintao|year=2006|author1=Tun-jen Cheng |author2=Jacques Delisle |author3=Deborah Brown |isbn=978-981-256-347-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuba==
The [[Cuban revolution|revolutionaries of 1959 in Cuba]] were known as the ''Generation of the Centenary'' after the [[centenary|100 year anniversary]] of the birth of [[José Martí]] in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The origins of the Cuban Revolution reconsidered|author=[[Samuel Farber]]|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hmdifpVk3SoC|isbn=978-0-8078-3001-7|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
The ''Université'' [[state education]] system established by [[Napoleon]] created a post-revolutionary generation in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KDh0NU6s3PEC|pages=149–150|title=The post-revolutionary self|author=[[Jan E. Goldstein]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-674-01680-4|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The 1840s were a decisive decade which culminated in the events of 1848 which defined a generation of Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQGMYLJRdXoC|chapter=ch. 3 A Revolutionary Generation|title=A history of modern Germany since 1815|author=Frank B. Tipton|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8264-4910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel==
The [[Second Aliyah]] generation was arguably the most important and influential [[aliyah]]. It took place between 1904 and 1914, during which approximately 40,000 Jews immigrated into Ottoman Palestine, mostly from Russia and Poland, some from Yemen. They were the generation that created the social, political and cultural foundations of the [[State of Israel]].

==Romania==
In [[Romania]], people who were born in 1989 are called the Revolution Generation, in reference to the [[Romanian Revolution]] of 1989 that ended the brutal Communist regime of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] and brought [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]] to Romania.

==United States of America==
Evarts Boutell Greene dated the generation of the [[American revolution]] as being from 1763 to 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xYp2AAAAMAAJ|title=The revolutionary generation, 1763-1790|author=Evarts Boutell Greene|year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yugoslavia==
The generation that came of age during or immediately after World War II and subsequent rise of communism. It is a generation marked by greater social mobility in comparison to previous period of Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which permitted the large section of population to obtain education. It was also marked by rapid urbanization and industrialization of the country, with a big population shift from rural to urban areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17756">'''Ritual slaughter''' is the practice of [[Slaughter (livestock)|slaughtering]] livestock for meat in the context of a [[ritual]]. Ritual slaughter involves a prescribed method of slaughtering an animal for food production purposes. This differs from [[animal sacrifice]]s that involve slaughtering animals, often in the context of rituals, for purposes other than mere food production.

Ritual slaughter as a mandatory method of slaughter for food production is practiced by Muslim and Jewish communities totaling nearly 25% of the world population. Both communities have similar religious philosophies in this regard.&lt;ref name=europarl/&gt; [[Temple Grandin]] has researched Ritual Slaughter practices and says that [[Slaughterhouse|abattoirs]] which use recommended methods cause livestock little pain; she calls the UK debate over Halal slaughterhouses misguided,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grandin.com/ritual/rec.ritual.slaughter.html&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that inhumane treatment of animals happens in poorly run slaughterhouses regardless of their halal status.&lt;ref&gt;https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/we-spoke-to-temple-grandin-about-the-uk-halal-slaughterhouse-controversy&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Farm Animal Welfare Committee|Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC)]], which advises British government on how to avoid cruelty to livestock, on the other hand, says the way Jewish Kosher and Muslim Halal meat is produced causes severe suffering to animals.&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt; Ritual slaughter is in many EU countries the only exception from the standard requirement, guarded by criminal law, to render animal unconscious before slaughter (before any cutting). While the Jews accept absolutely no stunning (rendering unconscious prior to cutting), many Muslims have accepted it as long as it can be shown that the animal could be returned to normal living consciousness (so that stunning does not kill an animal but is intended to render following procedure painless).&lt;ref name=europarl&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2012/120375/LDM_BRI(2012)120375_REV2_EN.pdf Religious slaughter of animals in the EU]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|animal sacrifice}}
[[Walter Burkert]] in ''[[Homo Necans]]'' discusses animal sacrifice as arising from the anthropological transition to [[hunting]]. With the domestication of livestock, the hunt was gradually replaced by the slaughter of livestock, and hunting rituals were consequently transformed to the context of slaughter.

In antiquity, ritual slaughter and animal sacrifice was one and the same. Thus, as argued by Detienne et al. (1989), for the [[Greeks]], consumption of meat not slaughtered ritually was unthinkable, so that beyond being a tribute to the gods, Greek animal sacrifice marked a cultural boundary, separating "Hellenes" from "[[barbarians]]". Greek animal sacrifice was [[christianized]] into slaughter ceremonies involving Greek Orthodox Christian ritual, known as ''[[kourbania]]''.

[[Ancient Egypt]]ian slaughter rituals are frequently depicted in tombs and temples from the [[Old Kingdom]] onward. The standard iconography of the ritual involves a bull lying fettered on the ground with the butcher standing over it cutting its [[foreleg of ox|foreleg]]. The scene is attended by a woman and two priests.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard Otto, ''An Ancient Egyptian Hunting Ritual'', Journal of Near Eastern Studies (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish and Islamic ritual slaughter==
{{see also|Animal sacrifice#Abrahamic traditions}}
[[Kashrut|Jewish]] and [[Islamic dietary laws|Islamic]] dietary laws require [[Comparison of Islamic and Jewish dietary laws|similar procedures]] for slaughtering animals. Ritual slaughter with a sharp knife is classified in the U.S. as 'humane' under the [[Humane Slaughter Act]] and practiced with no restrictions; in Europe, some countries have outlawed the practice as inhumane (see below).

According to Jewish and Muslim law, "slaughter is carried out with a single cut to the throat, rather than the more widespread method of stunning with a bolt into the head before slaughter."&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2977086.stm Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end'], [[BBC News]], June 10, 2003, accessed September 18, 2006 BBC article from June 10, 2003 reporting that the FAWC thought that ritual slaughter in Britain should be banned. These recommendations were rejected by the government.&lt;/ref&gt; The animal must be alive when its throat is cut and die from loss of blood.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11378667/Sharp-rise-in-halal-abattoirs-slaughtering-animals-without-stunning-them-first.html|title=Sharp rise in halal abattoirs slaughtering animals without stunning them first|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=fao7/&gt; Any kind of prestunning for livestock to be slaughtered according to the Jewish Kosher method has not yet been accepted.&lt;ref name=fao7&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/X6909E/x6909e09.htm Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific: ''Guidelines for Humane Handling, Transport and Slaughter of Livestock'', chapter 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish Shechita===
{{Main article|Shechita}}
[[File:Schect.jpg|thumb|15th c. depiction of Jewish ritual slaughter of animals for consumption]]

''[[Shechita]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|שחיטה}}) is the Jewish ritual slaughter for poultry and cattle for food according to [[Halakha]].&lt;ref&gt;Deut. 12:21; Deut. 14:21; Num. 11:22&lt;/ref&gt; Talmud – Tractate ''Hulin'' Shulkhan Arukh ''Yore De'ah''. The method of slaughter of animals for food is the same as was used for Temple sacrifices, but since the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jewish Temple]] in Jerusalem, sacrifices are prohibited. The Jewish Bible explains that animals not sacrificed must be slaughtered by the same method, and today ''Shechita'', kosher slaughtering does not include any religious ceremony, although the slaughtering method may not be deviated from, if the meat is to be consumed by Jews.

The act is performed by drawing a very sharp knife across the animal's throat making a single incision incising the trachea and esophagus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/222240/jewish/What-is-Shechita.htm|title=What is Shechita?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carotid arteries are also cut, allowing the blood to drain out. The knife must also be perfectly smooth, and free of any nicks.

The animal must be killed by a ''shochet'' - religious slaughterer also known in Hebrew as ''shochet ubodek'' (slaughterer and inspector). An inspection is mandatory and the animal is rejected for Jewish consumption if certain imperfections are discovered. A ''shochet'' must be a Jew in good standing in the community. The training period for a shochet varies, depending on the skill of the trainee. Qualifying as a slaughterer of only chickens can be achieved with a shorter period of study.

===Islamic Ḏabīḥah===
{{Main article|Ḏabīḥah}}
''Ḏabīḥah'' ({{lang|ar|ذَبِيْحَة}}) is the method prescribed in Islam for slaughtering all halal animals (goats, sheep, cattle, chickens), only excluding fish and most sea-life, according to [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. This means that unlawful animals (pig, dog, lion) may not be slaughtered (dabihah). This method of slaughtering halal animals needs several conditions to be fulfilled:
#the butcher must follow an Abrahamic religion (ie. to be Muslim, Christian, or Jew);
#the name of god/"ALLAH" should be called while slaughtering each halal animal separately;
#the killing should consist of complete drainage of blood from the whole body by a swift, deep incision with a very sharp knife on the throat, cutting the [[wind pipe]], [[jugular vein]]s and [[carotid arteries]] of both sides but leaving the [[spinal cord]] intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mufti Taqi Usmani|title=The Islamic Laws of Animal Slaughter|publisher= White Thread Press, CA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of this technique is to drain the body of the animal's blood more effectively, resulting in more hygienic meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isnahalal.ca/info.html Halal/Haram/Zabiha], ISNA Halal Certification Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;

==High-volume ritual slaughter==
Religious  slaughter  brings  extra challenges for large, high-volume slaughterhouses where focus is on fast, cost-effective throughput. There has been reports that 3.2 cuts are in practice required for   Jewish and 5.2 for Halal slaughter. It was also reported that for 1 in 10 animals arteries of an animal are not correctly severed resulting in prolonged death.&lt;ref name=europarl/&gt;

== European restrictions on ritual slaughter ==

{{Legend|#E6E6FA|No data}}]]
{{Main article|Legal aspects of ritual slaughter|}}
A number of countries in Europe (as well as [[Australia]]) have issued restrictions or outright bans on ritual slaughter. As of 2018, [[Slovenia]] is the only European country which has prohibited ritual slaughter altogether. A number of other countries, most notably in Scandinavia, has introduced legal requirements for animals to be stunned either before or just after having their throats cut during ritual slaughter. The question whether animals should be stunned or not remains a hotly contested issue, where animal welfare concerns regularly clash with religious concerns.&lt;ref name="Rawlinson"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Rawlinson |first1=Mary |last2=Ward |first2=Caleb |date=2016 |title=The Routledge Handbook of Food Ethics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUyTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA306 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=305–306 |isbn=9781317595502 |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bans on ritual slaughter have been proposed or enacted in a number of [[Europe|European countries]], from the 1840s onward. Most of them have been removed. Although ostensibly introduced for reasons of animal welfare, the consistent involvement of [[antisemites]] in the campaigns from the outset in the 1840s has, among other things led Pascal Krauthammer in a doctoral dissertation to conclude that the aim of the Swiss  anti-Semitic campaign, that included elements from blood libel accusations in neighbouring countries, was to  reimpose restrictions on Jews at a time when they were just beginning to achieve enfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Krauthammer. "Das Schächtverbot in der Schweiz 1854 - 2000. Die Schächtfrage zwischen Teirschutz, Politik und Fremdenfeindlichkeit  Zurich: Schulthess" (The Prohibition of Ritual Slaughter in Switzerland 1854-2000. The Ritual Slaughter Question from the Aspects of Animal Protection, Politics and Xenophobia) (Includes a Summary in English)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[Denmark]] ruled that Islamic and Jewish slaughter practices are inhumane, requiring that all animals be stunned before being killed for food,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/04/09/291887381/banning-traditional-animal-slaughter-denmark-stokes-religous-ire|title=Banning Traditional Animal Slaughter, Denmark Stokes Religious Ire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sparking a debate on religious freedom and the relative harms of different methods.

==Ethnic and regional traditions==

===Tauromachy===
{{Main article|Bullfighting}}
''Bullfighting'' and [[Running of the Bulls]] is still widely practiced in Spain, Portugal and many Spanish influenced areas of the Northern Mediterranean and Latin America. It is a modern adaptation of ancient ritual slaughter supposedly imported by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] soldiers who worshiped [[Mithras]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Bali===
{{Main article|Bali Sacrifice}}
''Bali'' (pronounced Bal-ee) or [[Bali Sacrifice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=O.P. Radhan |title=Encyclopaedia of Political Parties |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Encyclopaedia-Political-Parties-O-P-Radhan/dp/8174888659/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1280147889&amp;sr=1-1 |volume=33–50 |date=Sep 2002 |publisher=Anmol, India |isbn=81-7488-865-9 |page=854}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes known as ''Jhatka Bali'') is the ritual killing of an animal in [[Hinduism]]. [[Jhatka]] is the prescribed method for Hindu ritual sacrifice, however other methods such as strangulation and the use of a wooden spile (''sphya'') driven into the heart is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nripendr Kumar Dutt |title=Origin and Growth of Caste in India (C. B.C. 2000-300)|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Origin-Growth-Caste-India-2000-300/dp/1443735906/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1280148341&amp;sr=1-1 |accessdate=26 July 2010 |date=4 Nov 2008 |isbn=1-4437-3590-6 |page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that priests saw the animal making a noise as a bad omen. Jhatka requires the instant killing of the animal in a single [[decapitation|decapitating]] blow with an axe or sword. Those Hindus who do eat meat prescribe jhatka.

===Jhatka goat sacrifice in Sikhism===
{{Main article|Animal sacrifice in Sikhism}}
Ritual [[jhatka sacrifice of goats]] is also practiced by some sections of Sikhs such as Hazuri Sikhs and [[Nihang]]s on certain events of religious significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=A Nihang carries out 'Chatka' on a 'Chatanga' (a specially selected goat for sacrifice) |title=The Multifarious Faces of Sikhism throughout Sikh History |url=http://www.sarbloh.info/htmls/article_samparda_kartar17.html |website=sarbloh.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahaprashad"&gt;''"The most special occasion of the Chhauni is the festival of Diwali which is celebrated for ten days. This is the only Sikh shrine at Amritsar where Maha Prasad (meat) is served on special occasions in Langar"'', The Sikh review, Volume 35, Issue 409 – Volume 36, Issue 420, Sikh Cultural Centre., 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sikh Goat Sacrifice"&gt;''"The tradition traces back to the time of Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji who started the tradition of hunting for Sikhs ... The tradition of ritually sacrificing goats and consuming Mahaparshad remains alive not only with the Nihang Singh Dals, but also at Sachkhand Sri Hazoor Sahib and Sachkhand Sri Patna Sahib (two of the Sikhs holiest shrines)."'' [http://www.nihangsingh.org/website/trad-jhatka.html Panth Akali Budha Dal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sikh Goat Sacrifice2"&gt;''"Another noteworthy practice performed here is that a goat is sacrificed on Dussehra night every year. This ceremony was performed on Diwali day this year (Oct 28, 2008). The fresh blood of the sacrificed goat is used for tilak on the Guru’s weapons."'', SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS OF THE SIKH COMMUNITY, Dr Madanjit Kaur, Institute of Sikh Studies [http://sikhinstitute.org/apr_2009/10-madakaur.html Institute of Sikh Studies, Madan Kaur]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is to be noted that certain sections of Sikh society are opposed to this ritual and there exists a debate about its religious roots within Sikh society.&lt;ref&gt;Sacrifice at Hazur Sahib – Myth &amp; Truth, Nanak Singh Nishter, World Sikh News, 21 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sikh Bulletin"&gt;''"Sacrifice of a goat within precints of Gurudwara on a number of occasions, apply its blood to arms/armaments kept inside the shrine, distribute its meat as Prasad among devotees at their home."'' The Sikh Bulletin, July–August 2009, Volume 11, Number 7 &amp; 8, pp. 26, Khalsa Tricentenneal Foundation of N.A. Inc&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Ritual slaughter is practiced in various [[African traditional religions]]. [[Zulu people|Zulu]] slaughter rituals have led to controversy in South Africa.

Monica Hunter in her 1936 study of the [[King Faku|Mpondo people]] of the [[Transkei]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwxzAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=reaction+to+conquest+monica+hunter&amp;dq=reaction+to+conquest+monica+hunter&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnqdenpvbYAhWRnlMKHZtJD7AQ6AEIJzAA|title=Reaction to Conquest: Effects of Contact with Europeans on the Pondo of South Africa|last=Wilson|first=Monica Hunter|date=1979-01-01|publisher=David Philip|isbn=9780949968791|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the ritual:
{{quote|"When speaking to the ancestors was finished Sipopone [one of Hunter's informants] took the sacrificial spear of the umzi [homestead], passed it between the forelegs of the animal, and between its back legs, which were tied, then stabbed it in the stomach over the aorta muscle. The beast bellowed horribly, and lay in agony for about five minutes before it died."}}

The bellowing of the animal is supposed to represent communication with the ancestors. ([[David Welsh]] 2007)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ever-fasternews.com/index.php?php_action=read_article&amp;article_id=363&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2973">'''Round-tripping''', also known as round-trip transactions or "Lazy Susans", is defined by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as a form of [[barter]] that involves a company selling "an unused [[asset]] to another company, while at the same time agreeing to buy back the same or similar assets at about the same price."  Swapping assets on a round-trip produces no net [[economic substance]], but may be fraudulently reported  as a series of productive sales and beneficial purchases on the books of the companies involved, violating the [[substance over form]] accounting principle.  The companies appear to be growing and very ''busy'', but the round-tripping ''business'' does not generate profits.  Growth is an attractive factor to speculative investors, even if profits are lacking; such investment benefits companies and motivates them to undertake the illusory growth of round-tripping.

Round trips are characteristic of the [[New Economy]] companies. They played a crucial part in temporarily inflating the [[market capitalization]] of energy traders such as [[Enron]], [[CMS Energy]], [[Reliant Energy]], and [[Dynegy]]. 

In international scenarios, round tripping is used for tax evasion&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Hanlon, Edward L. Maydew, and Jacob R. Thornock: Taking the Long Way Home: Offshore Investments in U.S. Equity and Debt Markets and U.S. Tax Evasion; presented at 2010 National Tax Association meeting, EIASM 2011 Workshop on Current Research on Taxation at the University of Münster, 1 Sep.2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and money laundering as well.&lt;ref&gt;Aswath Rau and Pallabi Ghosal: “Entering the Tiger’s Den: Foreign Investment in India through Mauritius or Singapore”; ''Singapore Law Gazette'', Feb.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies making unconventional round-tripping deals include [[AOL]] with [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Global Crossing]] with [[Qwest Communications]]. It is alleged that when some telecommunications companies swapped capacity, they booked the value of the incoming capacity as revenue and the value of the outgoing capacity as an [[investment]]. These transactions had the effect of inflating profits. The [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] ruled that booking revenues from swaps in telecommunications capacity was improper.

Many such companies have used round-tripping to distort the market by establishing false [[revenue recognition|revenue benchmarks]], aiming to meet or beat the numbers put out by [[Wall Street]] stock analysts. As a result of abusive round trips, barter between publicly held companies has become discredited among professional investors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1284">A '''tactical event''' (Also known as a "Private Battle" in the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere) is a type of [[historical reenactment]], not usually open to the public,&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 224 "Sometimes they are closed events, in which the public is not invited to observe."&lt;/ref&gt; which is fought like a real battle with each side devising strategies and tactics to defeat their opponent(s). Tactical events have no script, a basic set of agreed-upon rules (physical boundaries, time limit, victory conditions, etc.), and onsite judges or referees,&lt;ref&gt;Hadden. p 23&lt;/ref&gt; and so could be considered a form of [[live action role-playing game]]. Tactical battles might also be considered a form of [[experimental archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hadden. p 23 "By living like the soldiers did, even for just a short time, the reenactors gain better understanding of how to wear the uniform and use the equipment."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Casey Jones}}
"'''The Ballad of Casey Jones'''" is a traditional song about [[railroad engineer]] [[Casey Jones]] and his death at the controls of the train he was driving.  It tells of how Jones and his fireman Sim Webb raced their locomotive to make up for lost time, but discovered another train ahead of them on the line, and how Jones remained on board to try to stop the train as Webb jumped to safety.  It is song number 3247 in the [[Roud Folk Song Index]].

The song helped preserve the memory of Jones' feat down through the years in its 40 plus versions and enhanced Casey’s legendary status to the extent that he has even become something of a [[myth]]ological figure like [[Pecos Bill]] or [[Paul Bunyan]] to the uninformed.  Books and pulp magazines about the [[railroad]] and its heroes helped to perpetuate his memory as well.

Soon after Casey’s death, the song was first sung by [[Wiper (occupation)|engine wiper]] and friend of Casey’s named Wallace Saunders to the tune of a popular song of the time known as "Jimmie Jones."&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, John A. and Alan Lomax. ''American Ballads and Folk Songs''. (1934; reprint, New York: Dover, 1994), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  He was known to sing and whistle as he went about his work cleaning the steam engines.  In the words of Casey’s wife: "Wallace's admiration of Casey was little short of idolatry. He used to brag mightily about Mr. Jones even when Casey was only a freight engineer." But Saunders never had his original version copyrighted, and thus there is no way of knowing precisely what words he sang.

As railroaders stopped in Canton, Mississippi, they would pick up the song and pass it along. Soon it was a hit up and down the [[Illinois Central|I.C. line]].  But it was up to others with a profit motive to take it and rework it for a nationwide audience.  Illinois Central Engineer William Leighton appreciated the song's potential enough to tell his brothers [[Frank Leighton]] and Bert Leighton, who were [[vaudeville]] performers, about it. They took it and sang it in theaters around the country with a chorus they added. But apparently even they neglected to get it copyrighted.

Reportedly, Saunders received a bottle of gin for the use of the song. Nothing more was heard from him after this time and he passed into history as the man who helped to make Casey Jones an integral part of American folklore.

Finally, with vaudeville performers T. Lawrence Seibert credited with the lyrics and Eddie Newton with the music, it was published and offered for sale in 1909 with the title "Casey Jones, The Brave Engineer". As their intent was to entertain, it was hailed on the cover of the sheet music as the "Greatest Comedy Hit In Years" and "The Only Comedy Railroad Song." This version was the one that was strenuously objected to by Casey's wife for making her appear to have been unfaithful to Casey. The offending lines read: "Mrs. Jones sat on her bed a sighing/Just received a message that Casey was dying/ Said go to bed children and hush your crying/Cause you got another papa on the Salt Lake line." This is similar to a line in the song "Duncan and Brady".  She spent her remaining years refuting those lines, once saying "That devil hasn't shown up in 58 years!"

By World War I, dozens of versions had been published and millions of copies were sold, securing the memory of a new American folk hero. Poet [[Carl Sandburg]] called the song "Casey Jones, the Brave Engineer" the "greatest ballad ever written".  Casey Jones figures in many railroad songs, such as "Freight Train Boogie", by [[the Delmore Brothers]].

'''''The New Adventures of Hitler''''' was a [[comics|comic]] series written by [[Grant Morrison]] and drawn by [[Steve Yeowell]] which first appeared in ''Cut'', a Scottish arts magazine in 1989 before being reprinted in the [[comics anthology|anthology]] ''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'' in 1990.

==Publication history==
''The New Adventures of Hitler'' was a [[satirical]] and [[Surrealism|surreal]] (one scene has Hitler opening a cupboard to find [[Morrissey]] singing "[[Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now]]") strip based on the claims of Hitler's sister-in-law [[Bridget Dowling]] that Hitler had lived with her, her husband Alois Hitler, Jr., and her son [[William Patrick Hitler]] in [[Liverpool]] from 1912 to 1913. It first appeared in ''Cut'', a Scottish arts and culture magazine and became instantly controversial, and some accused Morrison of being a [[Nazism|Nazi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barbelith.com/old/interviews/interview_1.shtml |title=Barbelith Interviews: An Interview with Grant Morrison |publisher=Barbelith.com |date=2002-09-02 |accessdate=2010-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219204742/http://www.barbelith.com/old/interviews/interview_1.shtml |archive-date=2011-02-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to his use of Hitler in what was essentially a humorous story. 

''Cut'' ceased publication before the entire strip was published, but ''The New Adventures of Hitler'' was printed in its entirety in ''Crisis'' in 1990.

''Crisis'' was a spin-off from ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' which printed more adult-oriented work and ''The New Adventures of Hitler'' fit in with the themes of the magazine. However the controversy which had surrounded the story in ''Cut'' continued with the strip's reprinting in ''Crisis''. The story ran from ''Crisis'' in issues 46-49 and a proposed collected edition by IPC never appeared. Morrison himself had planned to set up his own imprint to self-publish some of his work, including ''The New Adventures of Hitler'', but nothing came of the idea. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popimage.com/profile/morrison/012501_grant3.html |title=PopImage |publisher=PopImage |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525231539/http://www.popimage.com/profile/morrison/012501_grant3.html|archive-date=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, [[Derek Goldby]] was engaged as the show's director.  During out-of-town tryouts, he was replaced by [[Michael Kidd]].&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Dick. "'The Producer' by Christopher Davis" (book review), ''The New York Times'', March 5, 1972, p. BR4&lt;/ref&gt;  After thirteen previews, the Broadway production, produced by [[Emanuel Azenberg]] and directed and [[choreographed]] by Kidd, opened on October 19, 1970 at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]], where it ran for 505 performances. The cast included [[Hal Linden]] as Mayer Rothschild, Leila Martin as Gutele, [[Jill Clayburgh]] as Hannah Cohen, [[Keene Curtis]] in the multiple roles of the various national leaders doing business with the Rothschild family (Prince William of Hesse, Joseph Fouché, Herries, and Prince Metternich), [[Paul Hecht]] as Nathan Rothschild, [[Chris Sarandon]] as Jacob Rothschild, and [[Robby Benson]] as young Solomon Rothschild. [[Reid Shelton]] replaced Curtis later in the run.  The show enjoyed a second production in [[San Francisco]]. 

An Off-Broadway revival directed by [[Lonny Price]] and choreographed by Michael Arnold opened on February 10, 1990 at the American Jewish Theatre, where it ran for 435 performances. The cast included [[Mike Burstyn]] as Mayer, Leslie Ellis as Hannah, Allen Fitzpatrick in the multiple roles of  Prince William of Hesse, Joseph Fouché, Herries, and Prince Metternich, [[Robert Cuccioli]] as Nathan, and [[David Cantor (actor)|David Cantor]] as Amshel.&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Stephen.

==Synopsis==
In 1772 [[Frankfurt, Germany]], [[Jew]]s are restricted to living in the [[ghetto]] and frequently are the victims of violence (“Pleasure and Privilege”). [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] returns from [[Hanover]], where he was an apprentice [[bank]]er, to make his fortune in his home town. Because only twelve Jewish marriages are permitted in a given year, he is forced to come up with a plan in order to marry his fiancée Gutele (“One Room”). He reopens his shop, carrying goods and rare coins. At the Frankfurt Fair, he entices [[Prince William of Hesse]] with fanciful tales about rare coins (“He Tossed A Coin”), then bribes the prince in order to marry Gutele. Later, Mayer becomes agent for the court bankers, but he wants more. 

By 1778, Mayer and Gutele have five “Sons”, each of whom enters the business as soon as he is old enough. As they age, they and their father chafe at the many restrictions and indignities heaped upon Jews (“Everything”). In 1804, their success and their [[chutzpah]] take them to [[Denmark]] as superior court agents to the Danish king when Hesse must loan money to him to help fight a war (“Rothschilds and Sons”). However, Hesse is overthrown by Napoleon, and Minister of Police Joseph Fouché takes over (“Allons”). When Mayer and his sons return to Germany, they find no court for which they can be agents. Mayer sends his older sons off to collect Hesse's debts before the French can get them, and sends his younger son, [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild|Nathan]], to London to invest the money (“Sons" (reprise)).

Initially awkward in England, Nathan soon displays considerable investing talents (“This Amazing London Tower”). He falls in love with Hannah Cohen, an aristocratic English "Jewish Joan of Arc" devoted to charitable works (“I’m in Love! I’m in Love!”). He eventually wins her over by pledging to loan money to England to help win their war against Napoleon if the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] Herries pledges to make Germany and Austria lift their restrictions on Jews. In Germany, [[Prince Metternich]] promises roughly the same thing if the Rothschilds make the loan (“Have You Ever Seen a Prettier Congress”). In 1818, Metternich reneges on his bargain, and old Mayer dies, broken-hearted (“In My Lifetime”). His sons scheme to force Metternich to come to terms by continually undercutting his price for peace bonds, although the plan brings them to the brink of bankruptcy (“Bonds”). Metternich not only concedes but is forced to guarantee that all state bonds will be handled by the [[House of Rothschild]]. The ghetto walls are torn down, and Mayer's dream is realized.

Each year, Trop Jr has a theme of a "signature item", an item or action being incorporated in the entry films to ensure that they are unique and are made specifically for Trop Jr. The films must be seven minutes or less. The prize includes a digital camera, an ABC3 educational filmmaking experience and film and television short courses.

'''''Wayne's World 2''''' is a 1993 American [[comedy film]] starring [[Mike Myers]] and [[Dana Carvey]] as hosts of a [[public-access television]] [[cable television]] show in [[Aurora, Illinois]]. The film is the sequel to ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992), which was adapted from a [[Wayne's World|sketch]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

==Plot==
[[Rock and roll]] fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar now host their [[public-access television]] show, ''Wayne's World,'' from an abandoned factory in [[Aurora, Illinois]]. After an [[Aerosmith]] concert, Wayne has a dream in which he meets [[Jim Morrison]] and a "weird naked [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]" in a desert. Morrison convinces Wayne that his destiny is to organize a major music festival. Wayne and Garth dub the concert "Waynestock" and hire Morrison's former roadie, Del Preston. Their early attempts to sign bands and sell tickets fail, and Wayne wonders if the endeavor is futile.

Wayne's girlfriend Cassandra, singer of the band Crucial Taunt, has a new producer, Bobby Cahn, who tries to pull her away from Wayne and Illinois. Garth meets a beautiful woman, Honey Hornée. After Wayne admits spying on her due to his suspicion of Bobby's ulterior motives, Cassandra breaks up with him and becomes engaged to Bobby. Honey Hornée attempts to manipulate Garth into killing her ex-husband, but Garth ends the relationship.

Tickets are sold for Waynestock but no bands arrive. Leaving Garth to keep the rowdy crowd in check, Wayne disrupts Cassandra's wedding before escaping the ceremony with her and they get back together, in a scene closely resembling the finale of ''[[The Graduate]]''. Meanwhile, Garth has [[stage fright]] during the concert. Wayne returns to find the bands have still not arrived.

In the dream desert, Wayne and Garth consult Morrison, who says that the bands will not come and that all that matters is they tried. They become lost in the desert. Finding this unacceptable, Wayne and Garth reenact the ending of ''[[Thelma &amp; Louise]]'', driving their car off a cliff while trying to find the bands. Finally, Wayne and Garth stage an ending in which the bands arrive and Waynestock is a success. Bobby arrives to Waynestock to get Cassandra but is not allowed inside.

After the concert, the park is covered with trash and [[Keep America Beautiful|the "weird naked Indian" cries]]. Wayne and Garth begin to remove the litter, promising to clean the entire park.

==Production==
[[Penelope Spheeris]], who directed the [[Wayne's World (film)|first film]] believes that Myers encouraged the studio not to have her back for the sequel due to personality conflicts with Myers during the making of the first film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rottenberg |first=Josh |date=June 16, 2008 |title=Mike Myers: Man of Mystery |publisher=ew.com |url=http://ew.com/article/2008/06/16/mike-myers-man-mystery/ |accessdate=May 26, 2017 |quote="I hated that bastard for years," says Spheeris, who believes Myers dissuaded Paramount from hiring her for Wayne's World 2. "But when I saw Austin Powers, I went, 'I forgive you, Mike.'" She pauses, voice choked with emotion. "'You can be moody, you can be a jerk, you can be things that others of us can't be—because you are profoundly talented. And I forgive you.'"}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to direct another TV to big screen adaptation, ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies (film)|The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' instead and was replaced by Stephen Surjik for the sequel.

Myers' original script for ''Wayne's World 2'' had Wayne and Garth forming their own country and seceding from the US after finding an ancient scroll, in a story taken from the 1949 British comedy ''[[Passport to Pimlico]].''  This version was well into pre-production before it came to light that the studio had no idea the script was based on a previous film and thus had not obtained the rights to ''Passport to Pimlico''.  Production was immediately halted—director Surjik said: "I could hear the chainsaws literally chopping the sets down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Melnychuk |first=Mark |date=March 3, 2017 |title=Making Wayne's World 2 was 'traumatic' for director Stephen Surjik |publisher=[[Regina Leader-Post]] |url=http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/making-waynes-world-2-was-traumatic-for-director-stephen-surjik |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studio executive [[Sherry Lansing]] was reportedly furious with Myers and threatened to ruin his life and career if he didn't immediately produce a new script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=THR Staff |date=April 21, 2017 |title=Why Sherry Lansing Threatened Mike Myers: 'I'll Take Your F—ing House' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-sherry-lansing-threatened-mike-myers-ill-take-your-f-king-house-994864 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Wayne's World 2'' received mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Wayne's World 2': It's Not as Good, but Still Worthy |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 11, 1992 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-11/news/mn-255_1_wayne-s-world |first=Rone |last=Tempest |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 61% approval rating, based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The characters are still endearing, but the jokes in ''Wayne's World 2'' are more hit-and-miss the second time around".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/waynes_world_2/ |title=Wayne's World 2 (1993) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, and wrote that Wayne and Garth are "impossible to dislike".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 10, 1993 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/waynes-world-2-1993 |work=RogerEbert.com |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |title=Wayne's World 2 |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was intended to be a [[Christmas season]] blockbuster, ''Wayne's World 2'' did not receive the box office intake or positive fan reaction that the first film did. Its final North American gross was $48 million, slightly more than its $40 million production budget, but much less than the original film's gross of over $100 million. ''Wayne's World 2'' also suffered from competition from other holiday season [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s such as ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', ''[[Schindler's List]]'', and ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Wayne, Garth Party On at the Box Office Movies: 'Wayne's World' sequel pulls in an estimated $14.2 million to push "Mrs. Doubtfire" into second place.

'''''What's Cookin' Doc?''''' is a 1944 [[Warner Bros.]] [[animated film|cartoon]] in the [[Merrie Melodies]] series, directed by [[Bob Clampett]] and starring [[Bugs Bunny]]. The title is a variant on Bugs' catch-phrase "What's up Doc?". It also hints at one of the scenes in the picture.

== Plot ==
The plot centers on the [[Academy Awards]] presentation. The action begins with live action color film footage of various [[Hollywood]] scenes (edited from ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]''), narrated by [[Robert C. Bruce]]. It leads up to the Big Question of the evening: Who will win "the" Oscar? The film shows the stereotypical [[red carpet]] arrivals of stars, as well as a human [[Master of Ceremonies|emcee]] starting to introduce the Oscar show.

At this point the film switches to animation, with the shadow of a now-animated emcee (and now voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]) continuing to introduce the Oscar, and Bugs (also Mel Blanc's voice, as usual) assuring the viewer that "it's in da bag; I'm a cinch to win". Bugs is stunned when the award goes instead to [[James Cagney]] (who had actually won in the previous year's ceremony, for Warner's ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]''). Shock turns to anger as Bugs declares the results to be "[[Sabotage|sa-bo-TAH-gee]]" and demands a recount.

Bugs then tries to make his case by showing clips from ''[[Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt]]'' (which includes a clip of Hiawatha attempting to "cook" the rabbit) as proof of his allegedly superior acting (an inside joke, as the cartoon had actually been nominated for an Oscar and lost). He hurls a set of film cans off-screen and tells someone named "Smokey" to "roll 'em!"&lt;ref&gt;According to IMDB, [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037457/trivia this] is a reference to Schlesinger cameraman/projectionist Henry "Smokey" Garner. Director [[Bob Clampett]] later confirmed this in a 1969 ''Funnyworld'' [[magazine]] [[interview]]. That small clip is now used frequently in the special features for the first volume of the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Bugs tells the audience that these are some of his "best scenes". Immediately a "[[Pornographic film|stag reel]]" (with the title card depicting a grinning stag) starts to roll, and the startled Bugs quickly stops it and switches to the right film.  The clip starts with a title card of "BUGS BUNNY" in very large letters, as a brassy orchestral fanfare plays, and ends with an end title card of Bugs bending over to show his cotton tail and giving his toothy grin as a comically sped up version of the Merrie Melodies end theme ([[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]) is heard. There is then a parody of aggressive salesmanship. Bugs beats a big bass drum and parades across the stage with signs like “ Let Bugs Have It” and “Give It To Bugs”. Cigars are then quickly passed out en masse to the audience.

Finally, Bugs pleads with the audience, "What do you say, folks? Do I get it? Or do I get it?" (echoing [[Fredric March]]'s drunken appeal to the Academy Award banquet audience in ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]''). The emcee asks the audience (in an affected nasal voice), "Shall we give it to him, folks?" and they yell, "Yeah, let's give it to him!" whereupon they pelt Bugs with fruits and vegetables (enabling him to briefly do a [[Carmen Miranda]] impression)... and an [[ersatz]] Oscar labeled "[[booby prize]]", which is actually a gold-plated rabbit statue. Bugs is so pleased at winning it, he remarks, "I'll even take youse to bed wit' me every night!" The statue suddenly comes alive, asks in a voice like that of radio character, [[Bert Gordon (comedian)|Bert Gordon]], "Do you ''mean'' it?", smooches the startled bunny, and takes on an effeminate, hip-swiveling pose. The screen fades out, Clampett's famous vocalized "Bay-woop!" is heard, and the "That's all, Folks!" card appears.

==Analysis==
The subtext of the short is the self-consciousness of [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] about their then-lack of success at the Academy Awards. The studio had yet to win an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]].&lt;ref name="Crafton"&gt;Crafton (1998), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The clips from ''[[Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt]]'' (1941) allude to this subtext. It was a former nominee for the award and had lost to ''[[Lend a Paw]]'' (1941).&lt;ref name="Crafton"&gt;Crafton (1998), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

The live-action film footage derive from the film ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1937).&lt;ref name="Crafton"&gt;Crafton (1998), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Footage depict the footprints of the stars at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Chinese Theatre]], and nightlife at the [[Trocadero (Los Angeles)|Trocadero]] and the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cocoanut Grove]].&lt;ref name="Crafton"&gt;Crafton (1998), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

The premise of the film is that [[Bugs Bunny]] is competing for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. He demonstrates his acting ability by transforming into [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], and [[Edward G. Robinson]].&lt;ref name="Crafton"&gt;Crafton (1998), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; As the announcer lists the winner's traits, Bugs transforms to illustrate that they all apply to him: dramatic acting, refined comedy, skill at character roles, and prowess as a screen lover. He demonstrates his character acting by becoming [[Frankenstein's monster]] and his romantic acting by changing into [[Charles Boyer]] and romancing a carrot.&lt;ref name="Crafton"&gt;Crafton (1998), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Bugs campaigns for the award by addressing the people in the movie audience. His methods of campaigning include dispensing cigars, drum beating, and glad-handing. He thus earns a [[booby prize]], a second-class award reminiscent of the miniature Oscars awarded to ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937).&lt;ref name="Crafton"&gt;Crafton (1998), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The implication is that awards are not won by the most talented and deserving, but those capable of lobbying.&lt;ref name="Crafton"&gt;Crafton (1998), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

The short includes a subtle reference to World War II. There is a newspaper headline announcing the Academy Awards. A sub-headline on the same page reads "Jap [Japanese] [[Cruiser]] Blown Up". This is a reference to the contemporary [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].&lt;ref name="Shull"&gt;Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Another sub-headline notes, "[[Adolf Hitler|Adolph Hitler]] commits suicide". Ironically, that '''did''' happen, sixteen months after the film's original release.

==Availability==
* The short occurs in its entirety in the documentary ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]] Part 1'', which is available as a special feature on Discs 1 and 2 of the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 4]]'', although it has not been remastered or released independently in that series. 
* It also appears as a bonus short on two DVD releases; ''[[Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection]]'' (Disc 3), and on ''[[Captains of the Clouds]]'', both in their 1995 dubbed versions.
