[[Image:Amada Front.JPG|thumb|right|The facade of Amada temple]]
The Temple of '''Amada''', the oldest [[Egyptian temple]] in [[Nubia]], was first constructed by Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] of the [[18th dynasty]] and dedicated to [[Amun]] and Re-Horakhty.&lt;ref&gt;Lorna Oakes, Pyramids, Temples and Tombs of Ancient Egypt: An Illustrated Atlas of the Land of the Pharaohs, Hermes House:Anness Publishing Ltd, 2003. p.204&lt;/ref&gt; His son and successor, [[Amenhotep II]] continued the decoration program for this structure. Amenhotep II's successor, [[Thutmose IV]] decided to place a roof over its forecourt and transform it into a pillared or hypostyle hall.&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.204"&gt;Oakes, p.204&lt;/ref&gt; During the Amarna period, [[Akhenaten]] had the name Amun destroyed throughout the temple but this was later restored by [[Seti I]] of Egypt's 19th dynasty.&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.205"&gt;Oakes, p.205&lt;/ref&gt; Various 19th dynasty kings especially Seti I and [[Ramesses II]] also "carried out minor restorations and added to the temple's decoration."&lt;ref&gt;John Baines &amp; Jaromír Málek, Atlas of Ancient Egypt, Facts on File Publications New York, 1982. p.182&lt;/ref&gt; The stelas of the Viceroys of Kush [[Setau]], Heqanakht and Messuy and that of [[Chancellor Bay]] describe their building activities under Ramesses II, [[Merneptah]] and [[Siptah]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.205" /&gt;

==Temple interior==
[[Image:Amada relief of Thutmose III.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Relief of Thutmose III before the gods at Amada]]
The original building plan for the structure featured a pylon, forecourt and a portico which led to a sanctuary.&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.204" /&gt; However, when Thutmose IV roofed the open forecourt, the pillars and walls "were decorated with offering scenes, with those involving Thutmosis IV on the left" and Thutmose III and Amenhotep II on the right.&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.204"&gt;Oakes, p.204&lt;/ref&gt; Although the temple has a dull and crumbling exterior, its interior features enjoy some of the most finely cut reliefs with bright and vibrant colours.&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.204" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PlanetLee2018"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lonely Planet|author2=Jessica Lee|author3=Anthony Sattin|title=Lonely Planet Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkljDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT463|date=1 July 2018|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-78701-904-1|pages=463–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The finest painted reliefs are in the innermost section of the temple where Thutmose III and Amenhotep II are shown being embraced or making offerings to various Egyptian gods.&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.204"&gt;Oakes, p.204&lt;/ref&gt; The left hand side of the vestibule shows Amenhotep II being crowned by Horus and Thoth and running with an oar and a ''hap'' (or navigational instrument).&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.204" /&gt; The cult room at the side of the sanctuary contains some interesting foundation and consecration scenes for the temple which depict "the ritual of the 'stretching of the cord', the ceremonial making and laying of bricks, and the offering of the temple to its gods."&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.204" /&gt;

==Historical records==
There are two important historical inscriptions from Amada temple. The earliest, dated to Year 3 of Amenhotep II, "is on a round topped stelae at the rear (eastern) wall of the sanctuary."&lt;ref name="Baines &amp; Málek, p.182"&gt;Baines &amp; Málek, p.182&lt;/ref&gt; Its text describes this pharaoh's ruthless military campaign in Asia: 
{{cquote|His Majesty returned in joy to his father Amun after he had slain with his own mace the seven chiefs in the district of ''Takhesy'' (Syria) who were then hung upside down from the prow of the boat of His Majesty.&lt;ref name="Baines &amp; Málek, p.182" /&gt;}} 

Amenhotep II goes on to describe how he hanged six of the dead chiefs "on the walls of Thebes" while the seventh was hung on the walls of [[Napata]] (a Nubian frontier city near the [[Fourth Cataract]]).&lt;ref name="Oakes, p.205" /&gt; This was done as a clear warning to the subject Nubians of the dangerous consequences of rebellion during Amenhotep's reign. The second historical text, "on a stela engraved on the left (northern) thickness of the entrance doorway" mentions the defeat of an invasion from Libya in Year 4 of Merneptah.&lt;ref name="Baines &amp; Málek, p.182"&gt;Baines &amp; Málek, p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple was described by early travellers and first published by Henri Gauthier&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, Discovering Ancient Egypt, Facts on File, 1993. p.104&lt;/ref&gt; in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Gauthier, Le temple d'Amada (Cairo 1913)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1964 and 1975, the temple was moved from its original location to a new site "some 65 m higher and 2.5 km away from its original site".&lt;ref name="Baines &amp; Málek, p.182" /&gt; Chopping it into blocks, as was being done with the other temples, was not an option; the paintings would not have survived. Seeing that all seemed resigned to see the temple flooded by the silty waters of Lake Nasser, [[Christiane Desroches Noblecourt]] announced that France would save it. She asked two architects to propose a method for moving the temple in one piece. Their idea was to put the temple on rails and transport it hydraulically to a site a few kilometers away that was more than 60 meters higher.

The rock-cut [[Temple of Derr]] was also moved to the new site of Amada.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hobson, Exploring the World of the Pharaohs: A complete guide to Ancient Egypt, Thames &amp; Hudson 1993 paperback, p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anaisa Pye''' (alternatively, '''Anaisa Pie''', '''Anaisa Pie Danto''', or '''Anaisa La Chiquita''') is a very popular [[loa]] within [[Religion in the Dominican Republic#Afro-Caribbean religions|Dominican Vodou]].  She is considered the [[patron saint]] of love, money, and general happiness within the [[Religion in the Dominican Republic#Afro-Caribbean religions|21 Divisions]].  She is often considered extremely flirtatious, generous, and playful by her devotees.  She, as well as other worshipers, are concerned for other female Loas, as they consider themselves able to provide for anything a person could request.  In [[Roman Catholicism]], she is [[Syncretism#Religious_syncretism|syncretized]] with [[Saint Anne]] and her altars are often decorated with pictures and statues of Saint Anne and [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|the child Mary]].   She is said to work very well with [[Belie Belcan]], another popular Loa who is associated with [[St. Michael: Roman Catholic traditions and views|Saint Michael the Archangel]].  Therefore, one will always find icons of Saint Anne next to icons of Saint Michael in Vodou households and temples.  Her [[feast day]] is celebrated on 26 July and her favorite colors are yellow and pink.  Some people consider [[Our Lady of Charity|Cachita]] to be one of her "puntos" (or incarnations).

{{UgariticText}}

'''Anat''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑ:|n|ɑ:|t}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|æ|t}}), classically '''Anath''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|n|ə|θ|,_|ˈ|eɪ|ˌ|n|æ|θ}}; {{lang-he|עֲנָת}} ''ʿĂnāth''; {{lang-phn|𐤏𐤍𐤕}} ''ʿAnōt''; {{lang-uga|𐎓𐎐𐎚}} ''ʿnt''; {{lang-el|Αναθ}} ''Anath''; [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''Antit'', ''Anit'', ''Anti'', or ''Anant'') is a major northwest [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] goddess.

==In Ugarit==
In the [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] ''[[Baal Cycle]]'', ‘Anat is a violent war-goddess, a maiden (''btlt ‘nt'') who is the sister and, according to a much disputed theory, the lover of the great god [[Baal|Ba‘al]] [[Hadad]]. Ba‘al is usually called the son of [[Dagon|Dagan]] and sometimes the son of [[El (deity)|El]], who addresses ‘Anat as "daughter". Either relationship is probably figurative.

‘Anat's titles used again and again are "virgin ‘Anat" and "sister-in-law of the peoples" (or "progenitress of the peoples" or "sister-in-law, widow of the Li’mites").

In a fragmentary passage from [[Ugarit]] (modern '''Ras Shamra'''), [[Syria]]&lt;ref&gt;''CTA'' '''3 B''' (= UT 'nt II)&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Anat appears as a fierce, wild and furious warrior in a battle, wading knee-deep in blood, striking off heads, cutting off hands, binding the heads to her torso and the hands in her sash, driving out the old men and townsfolk with her arrows, her heart filled with joy. "Her character in this passage anticipates her subsequent warlike role against the enemies of Baal".&lt;ref&gt;[[P. C. Craigie]], "A Reconsideration of Shamgar Ben Anath (Judg 3:31 and 5:6)", ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' '''91'''.2 (June 1972:239–240), p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baal epic mp3h8973.jpg|left|200px|thumb|''[[Cuneiform script]]'', ([[Louvre]]) "Then Anat went to El, at the source of the rivers, in the middle of the bed of the two oceans. She bows at the feet of El, she bows and prosternates and pays him respects. She speaks and says: "the very mighty Ba'al is dead. The prince, lord of the earth, has died"" (...) "They fight like heroes. Môt wins, Ba'al wins. They bit each other like snakes. Môt wins, Ba'al wins. They jump like horses. Môt is scared. Ba'al sits on his throne".]]
’Anat boasts that she has put an end to [[Yam (god)|Yam]] the darling of El, to the seven-headed serpent, to Arsh the darling of the gods, to Atik 'Quarrelsome' the calf of El, to Ishat 'Fire' the bitch of the gods, and to Zabib 'flame?' the daughter of El. Later, when Ba‘al is believed to be dead, she seeks after Ba‘al "like a cow&lt;ref&gt;A ''wild'' cow, Albright clarifies, in ''Yahweh and the Gods of Canaan''.&lt;/ref&gt; for its calf" and finds his body (or supposed body) and buries it with great sacrifices and weeping. ‘Anat then finds [[Mot (Semitic god)|Mot]], Ba‘al Hadad's supposed slayer and she seizes Mot, splits him with a sword, winnows him with a sieve, burns him with fire, grinds him with millstones and scatters the remnants to the birds.

Text ''CTA'' '''10''' tells how ‘Anat seeks after Ba‘al who is out hunting, finds him, and is told she will bear a steer to him. Following the birth she brings the new calf to Ba‘al on Mount Zephon. Nowhere in these texts is ‘Anat explicitly Ba‘al Hadad's consort. To judge from later traditions [[Astarte|‘Athtart]] (who also appears in these texts) is more likely to be Ba‘al Hadad's consort. Complicating matters is that northwest Semitic culture permitted more than one wife and [[forms of nonmonogamy|nonmonogamy]] is normal for deities in many pantheons.

In the North Canaanite story of ''Aqhat'',&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Ginsberg, "The North-Canaanite myth of Anath and Aqhat", ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' '''97''' (February 1945:3-10).&lt;/ref&gt; the protagonist Aqhat son of the judge [[Danel]] (Dn'il) is given a wonderful bow and arrows which was created for ‘Anat by the craftsman god [[Kothar-wa-Khasis]] but which was given to Danel for his infant son as a gift. When Aqhat grew to be a young man, the goddess ‘Anat tried to buy the bow from Aqhat, offering even immortality, but Aqhat refused all offers, calling her a liar because old age and death are the lot of all men. He then added to this insult by asking 'what would a woman do with a bow?'

Like [[Inanna]] in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', ‘Anat complained to El and threatened El himself if he did not allow her to take vengeance on Aqhat. El conceded. ‘Anat launched her attendant Yatpan in hawk form against Aqhat to knock the breath out of him and to steal the bow back. Her plan succeeds, but Aqhat is killed instead of merely beaten and robbed. In her rage against Yatpan, (text is missing here) Yatpan runs away and the bow and arrows fall into the sea. All is lost. ‘Anat mourned for Aqhat and for the curse that this act would bring upon the land and for the loss of the bow. The focus of the story then turns to Paghat, the wise younger sister of Aqhat. She sets off to avenge her brother's death and to restore the land which has been devastated by drought as a direct result of the murder. The story is incomplete. It breaks at an extremely dramatic moment when Paghat discovers that the mercenary whom she has hired to help her avenge the death is, in fact, Yatpan, her brother's murderer. The parallels between the story of ‘Anat and her revenge on Mot for the killing of her brother are obvious. In the end, the seasonal myth is played out on the human level.

{{Ancient Near East mythology}}

Gibson (1978) thinks Rahmay ('The Merciful'), co-wife of El with [[Asherah|Athirat]], is also the goddess ‘Anat, but he fails to take into account the primary source documents. Use of dual names of deities in Ugaritic poetry are an essential part of the verse form, and that two names for the same deity are traditionally mentioned in parallel lines. In the same way, Athirat is called Elath (meaning "The Goddess") in paired couplets. The poetic structure can also be seen in early Hebrew verse forms.

==In Egypt==
Anat first appears in [[Egypt]] in the 16th dynasty (the [[Hyksos]] period) along with other northwest [[Semitic deities]]. She was especially worshiped in her aspect of a war goddess, often paired with the goddess [[`Ashtart]]. In the ''Contest Between Horus and Set'', these two goddesses appear as daughters of [[Ra|Re]] and are given as allies to the god [[Set (mythology)|Set]], who had been identified with the [[Ancient Semitic religion|Semitic]] god [[Hadad]].

During the [[Hyksos]] period Anat had temples in the [[Hyksos]] capital of [[Avaris]] and in [[Beth-Shan]] ([[Israel]]) as well as being worshipped in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. On inscriptions from Memphis of 15th to 12th centuries &lt;small&gt;BCE&lt;/small&gt;, Anat is called "Bin-Ptah", Daughter of [[Ptah]]. She is associated with Reshpu (''Canaanite'': [[Resheph]]) in some texts and sometimes identified with the native Egyptian goddess [[Neith]]. She is sometimes called "[[Queen of heaven (Antiquity)|Queen of Heaven]]". Her [[iconography]] varies. She is usually shown carrying one or more weapons.
{{Middle Eastern deities}}
The name of [[Anat-her]], a shadowy Egyptian ruler of this time, is derived from "Anat".

In the [[New Kingdom]] [[Ramesses II]] made ‘Anat his personal guardian in battle and enlarged Anat's temple in [[Pi-Ramesses]]. Ramesses named his daughter (whom he later married) Bint-Anat 'Daughter of Anat'. His dog appears in a carving in Beit el Wali temple with the name "Anat-in-vigor" and one of his horses was named ''‘Ana-herte'' 'Anat-is-satisfied'.

==In Mesopotamia==
In [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], the form one would expect ''Anat'' to take would be ''Antu'', earlier ''Antum''. This would also be the normal feminine form that would be taken by ''Anu'', the Akkadian form of [[Anu|An]] 'Sky', the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] god of heaven. Antu appears in Akkadian texts mostly as a rather colorless [[:wikt:consort|consort]] of [[Anu]], the mother of [[Ishtar]] in the [[Gilgamesh]] story, but is also identified with the northwest Semitic goddess ‘Anat of essentially the same name. It is unknown whether this is an equation of two originally separate goddesses whose names happened to fall together or whether Anat's cult spread to Mesopotamia, where she came to be worshipped as Anu's spouse because the Mesopotamian form of her name suggested she was a counterpart to Anu.

It has also been suggested that the parallelism between the names of the Sumerian goddess, [[Inanna]], and her West Semitic counterpart, Ishtar, continued in Canaanite tradition as Anath and [[Astarte]], particularly in the poetry of [[Ugarit]]. The two goddesses were invariably linked in Ugaritic scripture and are also known to have formed a triad (known from sculpture) with a third goddess who was given the name/title of [[Qetesh|Qadesh]] (meaning "the holy one").
==In Israel==
The goddess name, ‘Anat is preserved in the city names [[Beth-Anath]] and [[Anathoth]]. Anathoth seems to be a plural form of the name, perhaps a shortening of ''bêt ‘&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;nātôt'' 'House of the ‘Anats', either a reference to many shrines of the goddess or a plural of intensification.

The ancient hero [[Shamgar]], son of ‘Anat, is mentioned in [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 3.31 and 5:6, which raises the idea that this [[Biblical judges|judge]] or hero may have been understood as a demi-god, a mortal son of the goddess. But John Day (2000) notes that a number of [[Canaan]]ites known from non-Biblical sources bore that title and theorizes that it was a military designation indicating a warrior under ‘Anat's protection. [[Asenath]], "holy to Anath", was the wife of the Hebrew patriarch [[Joseph (Bible)|Joseph]].

In [[Elephantine]] (modern [[Aswan]]) in Egypt, the 5th century BCE [[Elephantine papyri]] make mention of a goddess called Anat-Yahu (Anat-Yahweh) worshiped in the temple to [[Yahweh]] originally built by Jewish refugees from the Babylonian conquest of Judah. These suggest that "even in exile and beyond the worship of a female deity endured."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gnuse|first=Robert Karl|title=No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel|year=1997|publisher=T&amp;T Clark|isbn=978-1850756576|page=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBSJNDndGjwC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=Anat-Yahu++Yahweh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9lt2UcP7Goi5O-blgYAN&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Anat-Yahu%20%20Yahweh&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The texts were written by a group of Jews living at Elephantine near the [[Nubia]]n border, whose religion has been described as "nearly identical to Iron Age II Judahite religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noll|first=K.L.|title=Canaan and Israel in Antiquity: An Introduction|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|location=2001|page=248|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rnyjxLHy-QC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=Anat-Yahu++Yahweh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QFt2UbePKY6R0QXK84DYCQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Anat-Yahu%20%20Yahweh&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papyri describe the Jews as worshiping Anat-Yahu (or AnatYahu).

==Athene==
In a [[Cyprian]] inscription (''KAI.'' 42) the Greek goddess [[Athena|Athêna]] Sôteira [[Nike (mythology)|Nikê]] is equated with ‘Anat (who is described in the inscription as the strength of life : ''l‘uzza hayim'').{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Anat is also presumably the goddess whom [[Sanchuniathon]] calls [[Athena|Athene]], a daughter of El, mother unnamed, who with [[Hermes]] (that is [[Thoth]]) counselled El on the making of a sickle and a spear of iron, presumably to use against his father [[Uranus (god)|Uranus]]. However, in the Baal cycle, that rôle is assigned to [[Asherah]] / [[Asherah|‘Elat]] and ‘Anat is there called the "Virgin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Myth of Baal &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt; |url=http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Lofts/2938/mythobaal.htm |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kn1OLEE1?url=http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Lofts/2938/mythobaal.htm |archivedate=2009-10-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed| reason=the source is not scholarly or academic.|date=April 2018}}

==Possible late transfigurations==
The goddess ‘Atah worshipped at [[Palmyra]] may possibly be in origin identical with ‘Anat. ‘Atah was combined with ‘Ashtart under the name ''Atar'' into the goddess ‘Atar‘atah known to the [[Hellenes]] as [[Atargatis]]. If this origin for ‘Atah is correct, then Atargatis is effectively a combining of ‘Ashtart and ‘Anat.

It has also been proposed that [[Indo-Iranian languages|(Indo-)Iranian]] [[Aredvi Sura Anahita|Anahita]] meaning 'immaculate' in [[Avestan]] (''a'' 'not' + ''ahit'' 'unclean') is a variant of ''‘Anat''. It is however unlikely given that the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] roots of the term are related to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] ones and although—through conflation—Aredvi Sura Anahita (so the full name) inherited much from [[Ishtar]]-[[Inanna]], the two are considered historically distinct.

In the Book of Zohar, ‘Anat is numbered among the holiest of angelic powers under the name of Anathiel.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2007}}
An '''archpriest''' is an ecclesiastical title for certain [[priest]]s with supervisory duties over a number of [[parish]]es. The term is most often used in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and may be somewhat analogous to a [[monsignor]] in the [[Latin Church]], but in the Eastern Churches an archpriest wears an additional vestment and, typically, a [[pectoral cross]], and one becomes an archpriest via a liturgical ceremony.

The term may be used in the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] instead of [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] or ''vicar forane''.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, during the [[persecution of Catholics]] in [[Kingdom of England|England]], an archpriest appointed from [[Holy See|Rome]] had authority over all of the church's [[secular clergy]] in the country. In the present-day [[Church of England]], a [[Rural Dean|rural or area dean]] resembles an archpriest. In the Catholic [[Latin Rite]] traditionally a priest's first Mass has an archpriest assisting the newly ordained priest, functioning as the deacon otherwise does, but this is only for that event.

== Antiquity ==
In ancient times, the [[archdeacon]] was the head of the diaconate of a diocese, as is still the case in the Eastern Orthodox Church, while the archpriest was first the chief of the [[presbyterium]] of the diocese. His duties included deputising for the [[Bishop]] in spiritual matters when necessary.

== Western Christianity ==

=== Latin Catholic Church ===
{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}
In the western church, by the [[Middle Ages]], the title had evolved and was that of the priest of the principal [[parish]] among several local parishes. This priest had general charge of worship in this archpresbyterate, and the parishioners of the smaller parishes had to attend Sunday [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and hold [[baptism]]s at the principal parish while the subordinate parishes instead held daily mass and homilies.

Exceptionally, the Pope could elevate one to the rank of archipresbyterate nullius, detached from any prelature, yet under a non-prelate, as happened in 1471 with the future abbacy (1583) and (since 1828) bishopric of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Guastalla|Guastalla]].

By the time of the [[Council of Trent]] the office of archpriest was replaced by the office of [[vicar forane]], also known in English as "dean". The first recorded use of this meaning of the title comes from [[Charles Borromeo|St Charles Borromeo]]'s reforms in his own diocese. Unlike [[vicar general|vicars general]] and vicars episcopal, vicars forane are not [[prelate]]s, which means they do not possess [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] power. Their role is entirely supervisory, and they perform visitations for the bishop and report to the bishop or vicar general any problems in their vicariate.

From late [[Elizabethan England]] until 1623, an Archpriest was appointed from [[Rome]] to oversee the Roman Catholic Church's mission in England, with authority over all [[secular clergy]] in the country.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Archpriest|volume=2|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of archpriest has survived in [[Rome]], in [[Malta]] and elsewhere, where it is now held by the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]s of the major [[basilica]]s. However, the title is entirely honorary, reflecting the fact that these churches held archpriestly status in the past.

There are four archpriests, for each of the four papal [[major basilica]]s in Rome, all of whom presently are bishops :
* [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]]
* [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]]
* [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]]
* [[St. Peter's Basilica]]

Many churches (thousands) in the world, other than basilicas, have the right to be governed by an archpriest, according to the specific historical tradition. Hence, the title is mostly honorary. Today, the archpriest has no control over the subordinate clergy. The use of "archpriest" in Roman Catholicism should not be confused with "[[protopriest]]", the senior [[Cardinal-Priest]] in the [[College of Cardinals]].

=== Church of England ===
In the [[Church of England]] there is at least one archpriest, the Archpriest of [[Haccombe]]. The appointment was first made in AD 1315 and has been held ever since. It was confirmed by an Order in Council on 1 April 1913 under King George V&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=28706|date=1 April 1913|page=2357-2360}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The title reflects the fact that the archpriest has the right to sit beside the bishop and acknowledges no authority below that of the Archbishop of Canterbury, although today, it is more appropriate to go through the usual channels of the church's hierarchy. Haccombe is a [[village]] in [[Devon]], near [[Newton Abbot]] where the parish is combined with that of Stoke-in-Teignhead with Combe-in-Teignhead. There is an hereditary patron for the Church of St Blaise, Haccombe. The modern office most closely resembling that of archpriest is the role of [[rural dean]] (rural dioceses) or [[area dean]] (urban dioceses). Like the archpriest of old, these officers have supervisory duties, but not ordinary jurisdiction, and are entitled to carry out visitations of subordinate parishes when so commissioned. With this in mind, although the Archpriest of Haccombe holds a unique role in the Church of England, it must be considered analogous with certain incumbencies which bear the title "Dean" regardless of whether or not their incumbent is the actual rural or area dean. One example of this historical oddity is the office of Dean of Bocking in Essex.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Archpriest''', also '''protopope''' ({{lang-grc-gre|πρωτοπαπᾶς}}, ''protopapas'') or '''protopresbyter''' ({{lang-grc-gre|πρωτοπρεσβύτερος}}, ''protopresbyteros''), is a clerical rank, a title of honor given to non-monastic priests&lt;ref name="Ware"&gt;{{Citation |last=Ware |first=Timothy

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Among monastic clergy in many places, the equivalent of being made an archpriest is to be given the rank of [[archimandrite]] as an honorary title (by original definition, an archimandrite is the abbot of a large monastery).&lt;/ref&gt; and is conferred by a bishop with the [[laying on of hands]] and prayer.&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;{{Citation |last=Sokolof |first=Archpriest Dimitrii

}}&lt;/ref&gt; An archpriest typically wears an [[epigonation]], a vestment originally worn only by bishops; however, details vary locally, and in some places being given the epigonation is an honor that typically precedes being made an archpriest and in other places, it is an honor that is given to only some archpriests.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
And, in the Russian Church, the last situation is always true with the added complexity of, as a step before being made an archpriest, being awarded another vestment peculiar to the Russian tradition, the [[nabedrennik]]; numerous other local customs exist.
&lt;/ref&gt; An archpriest also wears a [[pectoral cross#Eastern Catholic and Orthodox practice|pectoral cross]] both as part of his street clothes and when vested.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
In the Russian tradition, every priest wears a pectoral cross and being given a gold pectoral cross and then a jeweled one typically precede being made an archpriest and protopresbyter, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ceremony for making an archpriest is analogous to other clerical promotions bestowed with cheirothesia: at the [[Entrance (liturgical)#Little Entrance|little entrance]]  of the [[Divine Liturgy|divine liturgy]], the candidate is conducted to the [[Ambon (liturgy)|ambo]] in the middle of the church where the bishop is at the time, and the bishop blesses him and says a prayer&lt;ref name="DS"/&gt; addressed to Christ asking to "... endue our brother (name) with Thy Grace, and adorn him with virtue to stand at the head of the Presbyters of Thy people, and make him to be a good example to them that are with him ..."&lt;ref name="GBN"&gt;{{Citation |title=The Great Book of Needs: Expanded and Supplemented (Volume 1): The Holy Mysteries (v. 1) |year=2000 | publication-date=2000

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Russian tradition, protopresbyter is a higher rank than archpriest, as explained in a translation by the [[Orthodox Church in America]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Although entitled "for the making of a Protopresbyter" it is clear that what is now known as an "Archpriest" is what is usually meant.  The rank of "Protopresbyter" as a distinction higher than "Archpriest" is a later addition. The same Order, naturally, is used for what is now called "Protopresbyter".&lt;ref name="GBN"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7357">The '''Association of German National Jews''' (German: ''Verband nationaldeutscher Juden'') was a [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] organization during the [[Weimar Republic]] and the early years of [[Nazi Germany]] that eventually came out in support of [[Hitler]].

==History, goals, outcome==
It was founded in 1921 by [[Max Naumann]] who was chairman until 1926 and again from 1933 to 1935 when the association was dissolved.&lt;ref name="Gordon47"&gt;Sarah Ann Gordon, ''Hitler, Germans, and the "Jewish question"'', p.47&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, the association was close to the [[National conservatism|national conservative]] and [[Monarchism|monarchist]] [[German National People's Party]] which, however, refused affiliation with the association.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} M. Hambrock, ''Die Etablierung der Aussenseiter. Der Verband nationaldeutscher Juden 1921-1935'', p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the Association was the total assimilation of Jews into the German Volksgemeinschaft, self eradication of Jewish identity, and the expulsion from Germany of the Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Wistrich177"&gt;Robert S. Wistrich, ''Who's who in Nazi Germany'' (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1982), p.177. {{ISBN|0-297-78109-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naumann was especially opposed to [[Zionists]] and [[Eastern European Jews]], the former he considered a threat to Jewish integration and to be carriers of a "racist" ideology serving British imperial purposes, while he saw the latter as racially and spiritually inferior.&lt;ref name="Wistrich177"/&gt;

The association's official organ was the monthly ''Der nationaldeutsche Jude'' edited by Max Naumann. The magazine had a circulation of 6000 in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} M. Zimmermann, ''Geschichte des deutschen Judentums 1914 - 1945'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the activities of this group was the fight against the [[Jewish boycott of German goods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} M. Hambrock, ''Die Etablierung der Aussenseiter. Der Verband nationaldeutscher Juden 1921-1935'', p. 590ff.&lt;/ref&gt; They also issued a manifesto that stated that the Jews were being fairly treated.

In 1934 the group made the following statement:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=N. Stoltzfus |title=Resistance of the heart. Intermarriage and the Rosenstrasse protest in Nazi Germany |year= |publisher= |location= |page=315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have always held the well-being of the German people and the fatherland, to which we feel inextricably linked, above our own well-being. Thus we greeted the results of January, 1933, even though it has brought hardship for us personally."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A possible reason why some German Jews supported Hitler may have been that they thought that his antisemitism only was for the purpose of "stirring up the masses".&lt;ref name="Gordon47"/&gt;

The seemingly ironic fact that a Jewish association advocated loyalty to the Nazi programme gave rise to a contemporary joke about Naumann and his followers ending their meeting by giving the Nazi salute and shouting "Down With Us!".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gessner, ''[http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/1930s_antisemitism_pdf Some of my best friends are Jews]'' (New York, 1936), p. 81; Matthias Hambrock&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Die Etablierung der Aussenseiter. Der Verband nationaldeutscher Juden 1921-1935|last = M. Hambrock|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 578|jstor = 20741334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their extreme patriotism, the German government did not accept their goal of assimilation. The Association of German National Jews was declared illegal and dissolved on 18 November 1935. Max Naumann, was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] the same day and imprisoned at the [[Columbia concentration camp]]. He was released after a few weeks, and died of cancer in May 1939.&lt;ref name="Wistrich177"/&gt;

==Another similar group==
A similar contemporary Jewish group in Germany included the '''German Vanguard''' (''Der deutsche Vortrupp''), the German-Jewish followers of Hitler led by [[Hans-Joachim Schoeps]],&lt;ref name="Gordon47"/&gt; also referred to as "Nazi Jews". Schoeps went into exile in Falun/Sweden in 1938, just before the persecutions began in earnest. His two sons were born there. Schoeps returned to Germany after the war and was made professor of religious history at the university of [[Erlangen]] in northern [[Bavaria]], ten miles north of [[Nuremberg]]. He remained a monarchist and wanted to re-introduce monarchy in post-war Germany. His involvement in the ''Vortrupp'' and his personal engagement for the success of the Nazi movement did not become known at Erlangen while he was a professor there until 1970. He was firmly opposed to the liberal-socialist student movement after [[History of Germany (1945–90)#The Sixties: a time for reform|1967]], and published a book in 1972 in which he claimed that Germany was threatened by anarchy. Schoeps was a member of the [[Germany Foundation|Deutschland-Stiftung]], in which former Nazis were active.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

==Initial Nazi policy towards German Jews==
The policy of the German government was to promote Jewish emigration from Germany, and as a consequence it promoted and encouraged the activities of [[Zionist]] organisations while at the same time repressing anti-Zionist organisations such as the German National Jews, especially as they were among those who advocated Jewish assimilation in Germany.&lt;ref name="Nicosia118ff"&gt;F. R. Nicosia, ''Zionism and anti-semitism in Nazi Germany'', p. 118ff&lt;/ref&gt; The Zionists were commended in the SS newspaper by [[Heydrich]] for what he interpreted as their racialist position, and Jewish assimilationists were chastised for denying their race.&lt;ref name="Nicosia118ff"/&gt;

[[File:Bathouism flag.svg|thumb|200px|Bathou flag.]]
'''Bathouism''' (बाथौ)  is the traditional religion of the [[Bodo people]] or [[Kachari people]]. The name ''Bathou'' in [[Bodo language|Bodo]] means ''five principles''.  The five principles are: ''bar'' (air), ''orr'' (fire), ''ha'' (earth), ''dwi'' (water) and ''okhrang'' (sky).  The chief deity, called ''Bathoubwrai'' (''bwarai'': "the Elder")&amp;mdash;omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent&amp;mdash;is said to have created the five principles.  Though there are other minor gods and goddesses, Bathoubwrai  is considered the Supreme God.  Bathoubwrai is unseen. The second most important deity is ''Mainao'', the consort of Bathoubwrai, who is considered as the "protector of the rice fields".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Endle|1911|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sijou plant==
The ''sijou'' plant, a woody species of ([[Euphorbia neriifolia|E. neriifolia]] ) is considered the living embodiment of  Bathoubwrai.  Families that follow Bathouism plant a sijou shrub at the northeast corner of their courtyard, in an altar called ''sijousali''.  Bodo communities that follow Bathouism generally plant a sijou shrub at a community land, fenced with eighteen pairs of bamboo strips with five fastenings.  Each pair symbolizes a pair of minor god-goddess.  The five fastenings signify, from bottom: birth, pain, death, marriage and peace/pleasure.  The bottom three fastenings, called ''bando'', are those that one cannot escape in life; whereas the top two one could.

==Gods, goddesses and gurus==
{{harv|Endle|1911}} differentiates between household gods and community gods.  Of the household gods Bathoubwrai, Mainao, Song Bwrai/Burai and Bura Bah Raja are considered prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Endle|1911|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice of representing Bathoubwrai by the sijou tree was more common in among Boro kachari and more in Darrang.  Song Raja is usually represented inside the house in an altar called ''dham'', a deity who obtains devotion from women, and receives offerings during women's menses; but these offerings are eventually brought out and laid at the sijou tree representing Bathou.

The eighteen pairs of gods-goddesses are: 1 Mwnsinsin bwrai-Mwnsinsin burwi, 2 Si Bwrai-Si Burwi, 3 Aham Bwrai-Aham Burwi, 4 Khuria Bwrai-Khuria Burwi, 5 Eheo  Bwrai-Eheo Burwi 6 Mainao Bwrai-Mainao-Burwi, 7 Bwlli Bwrai-Bwlli Burwi, 8 Deva Bwrai-Devi Burwi, 9 Gongar Bwrai-Gongar Burwi, 10 Joumwn Bwrai-Joumwn Burwi, 11 Song Raja-Song Rani, 12 Hasung Bwrai-Hasung Burwi, 13 Rajong Bwrai-Rajong burwi, 14 Agrang Bwrai-Agrang Burwi, 15 Hazw Bwrai-Hazw Burwi, 16. Emao Bwrai-Emao Burwi 17. Mohela Bwrai-Mohela Burwi and 18. Hafao Bwrai-Hafao Burwi.

==Worship==

===Traditional===
Traditional Bathouism does not have any written scripture or religious book, nor temples. The worship is performed at the sijousali, and constituted offering animals and fowls for sacrifice and rice beer. Notable religious festivals were Kherai, Garja and others. These ceremonies are performed by priests called Douri (male priest) and Doudini (female priest). This religion was not organized.

===Revivalism/Reformation===
''All Bathou Religious Union'', an organization, was constituted in 1992; and it has begun reviving and reforming the traditional religion.  The traditional role of the ''Douri'' and ''Doudini'' are replaced by the ''Gwthari Asari'' appointed by the organization, and a band of singers who sing in a practice called ''Bathou Aroj''.  The construction of temples, resembling churches or mosques called ''Thansali'', have come into being.  Bathou aroj is performed on Tuesdays in Thansalis.  Sacrifices of animals and fowls, and offering of rice beer as modes of worship has been replaced by offering of flowers, fruits and the burning of incense.  The partaking of ''prasad'' has also become popular

'''Baxian Caves''' ({{zh|c=八仙洞|p=Bāxiān Dòng}}) are [[sea cave]]s located in the east coast of [[Changbin, Taitung|Changbin Township]], [[Taitung County]], [[Taiwan]].

==History==
Recently, the caves have been occupied and used as temples or places to place cremation ashes. However since 10 years ago, the Cultural Heritage Preservation Act was promulgated, subsequently the Taitung County Government, East Coast National Scenic Area and Changbin Township Office had been trying to take over the caves. On 22 November 2017, they finally managed to take back the last cave and completed the reclamation of all 30 saves in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3304059|date=22 November 2017|title=Taiwan’s Taitung County reclaims the last occupied cave of the country’s oldest prehistoric site|publisher=Taiwan News|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
Baxian Cave possesses a distinctive eroded look and is famous for ruins dating from the [[Old Stone Age]]. There are 10-plus caves on the {{convert|328|ft|m|disp=flip}} high precipice, each of a different size and depth. Originally the caverns were below sea level, allowing waves to shape them, but now they are located on a high cliff—proof of the East Coast's changing surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastcoast-nsa.gov.tw/en-us/Attractions/Detail/70 |title=Baxian Cave |work=East Coast National Scenic Area |publisher=ECNSA Headquarters |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321182756/http://www.eastcoast-nsa.gov.tw/en-us/Attractions/Detail/70 |archivedate=2016-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benjamin Franklin Johnson''' (July 28, 1818 – November 18, 1905)&lt;ref&gt;Date of death from {{Harvnb|LeBaron|1966|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an early member of [[Latter Day Saint Movement]], and a member of the [[Council of Fifty]] and a formerly private secretary to [[Joseph Smith]].  He served fourteen terms in the [[Utah State Legislature]] and was also a brickmaker, merchant, tavern keeper, leatherworker, farmer, nurseryman, and beekeeper.&lt;ref name=JSP&gt;[http://josephsmithpapers.org/person?name=Benjamin+F.+Johnson Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104215453/http://josephsmithpapers.org/person?name=Benjamin+F.+Johnson |date=January 4, 2012 }} of Benjamin F. Johnson, The Joseph Smith Papers (accessed January 10, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born to Ezekiel Johnson and Julia Hills at Pomfret, New York, he moved to Kirtland, Ohio in 1833. He married Melissa Bloomfield LeBaron on Christmas Day, December 25, 1841.

==Latter Day Saint Movement==
Johnson was baptized into the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of the Latter Day Saints]]&lt;!-- in from 1834 to 1838 this was the name of this Church --&gt; at Kirtland by Lyman E. Johnson in the spring of 1835. Heber C. Kimball ordained him an elder March 10, 1839 at Far West, Missouri and John Smith ordained him a  high priest in 1843 at Ramus, Illinois. He served as a missionary for his new faith to the eastern United States and Upper Canada between 1840 and 1842. He was appointed to Joseph Smith's Council of Fifty in 1843.&lt;ref name = JSP/&gt;

In 1838 he moved to [[Adam-ondi-Ahman]], Missouri where he was arrested and kept under guard for eight days in intensely cold weather before an open campfire. While he was sitting on a log, a "brute" came up to him with a rifle in his hands and said, "You give up Mormonism right now, or I'll shoot you." Benjamin decisively refused, upon which the ruffian took deliberate aim at him and pulled the trigger. The gun failed to discharge. Cursing fearfully, the man declared that he had "used the gun 20 years and it had never before missed fire." Examining the lock, he reprimed the weapon and again aimed and pulled the trigger—without effect.
Following the same procedure he tried a third time, but the result was the same. A bystander told him to "fix up his gun a little" and then "you can kill the cuss all right." So for a fourth and final time the would-be murderer prepared, even putting in a fresh load. However, Benjamin declared, "This time the gun bursted and killed the wretch upon the spot." One of the Missourians was heard to say, "You'd better not try to kill that man."  &lt;ref&gt;E. Dale LeBaron, "Benjamin  Franklin Johnson:  colonizer, public servant and Church leader" (Master's thesis Brigham Young University, 1966), 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to [[Springfield, Illinois]] in 1839, Ramus (later Webster) in 1842, Nauvoo in 1845, and Bonaparte, Iowa Territory in 1846. In 1848 he arrived in the Salt Lake Valley with [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and served in the Utah territorial legislature from 1855 to 1867. Johnson left Utah for the [[Arizona Territory]] in 1882, settling in Tempe before going to [[Colonia Diaz]], Chihuahua, Mexico in 1890 and returning to Arizona in 1892. He died at Mesa.&lt;ref name=JSP/&gt;

==Plural marriage==
{{Copy section to Wikisource}}
[[Plural Wives of Joseph Smith Jr.|Johnson's sister]] married [[Joseph Smith]] as a [[plural marriage]].  Johnson records the event where Joseph Smith approached Johnson about the arrangement:&lt;ref&gt;From E. Dale LeBaron, ''Benjamin Franklin Johnson: Friend to the Prophets'' (Provo, UT: Grandin Book Company, 1997), 219–234&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It was Sunday morning, April 3rd or 4th, 1843, that the Prophet was at my home in Ramus, and after breakfast he proposed a stroll together, and taking his arm, our walk led toward a swail, surrounded by trees and tall brush and near the forest line not far from my house. Through the swail ran a small spring brook, across which a tree was fallen and was clean of its bark. On this we sat down and the Prophet proceeded at once to open to me the subject of plural and eternal marriage and he said that years ago in Kirtland the Lord had command him then to take another wife, and that among his first thoughts was to come to my mother for some of her daughters. And as he was again required of the Lord to take more wives, he had come to ask me for my sister Almira.

His words astonished me and almost took my breath. I sat for a time amazed and finally, almost ready to burst with emotion, I looked him straight in the face and said: "Brother Joseph, this is something I did not expect, and I do not understand it. You know whether it is right, I do not. I want to do just as you tell me, and I will try, but if I ever should know that you do this to dishonor and debauch my sister, I will kill you as sure as the Lord lives." And while his eyes did not move from mine, he said with a smile, in a soft tone: "But Benjamin you will never know that, but you will know the principle in time, and will greatly rejoice in what it will bring to you." "But how," I asked, "can I teach my sister what I myself do not understand, or show her what I do not myself see?" "But you will see and understand it," he said, "and when you open your mouth to talk to your sister, light will come to you and your mouth will be full and your tongue loose, and I will today preach a sermon to you that none but you will understand." Both of these promises were more than fulfilled. The text of his sermon was our use of the "one, five and ten talents," and as God had now commanded plural marriage, and was exaltation and dominion of the saints depended upon the number of their righteous posterity, from him who was then but with one talent, it would be taken and given him that had ten, which item of doctrine seems now to be somewhat differently constructed.

But my thought and wish is to write of things just as they occurred, and I now bear an earnest testimony that his other prediction was more than fulfilled, for when with great hesitation and stammering I called my sister to a private audience, and stood before her shaking with fear, just so soon as I found power to open my mouth, it was filled, for the light of the Lord shone upon my understanding, and the subject that had seemed so dark now appeared of all subjects pertaining to our gospel the most lucid and plain; and so both my sister and myself were converted together, and never again did I need evidence or argument to sustain that high and holy principle. And within a few days of this period my sister accompanied me to Nauvoo, where at our sister Delcena's, we soon met the Prophet with his brother Hyrum and Wm. Clayton, as his private secretary, who always accompanied him. Brother Hyrum at once took me in hand, apparently in fear I was not fully converted, and this was the manner of his talk to me: "Now Benjamin, you must not be afraid of this new doctrine, for it is all right. You know Brother Hyrum don't get carried away by worldly things, and he fought this principle until the Lord showed him it was true. I know that Joseph was commanded to take more wives, and he waited until an angel with a drawn sword stood before him and declared that if he longer delayed fulfilling that command he would slay him." This was the manner of Brother Hyrum's teaching to me, which I then did not need, as I was fully converted." }}

==History==
The earliest reference to Bhojas is found in rock edits of Ashoka as well as [[Bhavishya Purana]].&lt;ref name=bhojaka&gt;{{cite book|last=Arora|first=Raj Kumar|title=Historical and cultural data from the Bhaviṣya purāna|year=1972|publisher=Sterling Publishers|location=the University of Virginia|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are connected to the [[Yadava]]s of [[Vidarbha]] and [[Dvārakā|Dwaraka]],and are believed to have descended from them.
Though their history is very obscure,copper-plates and other literary historical sources shed light on their history. While ruling ''Chandramandala'' area from Chandraura,their territory might have extended Goa,parts of [[North Canara]] and [[Belgaum]] districts of [[Karnataka]].Some sources say that they might have been feudatories of the Satavahana.&lt;ref name=gaz&gt;{{cite book|title=Goa gazetteer|publisher=Government of Goa|location=Panajim|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were known for overseas trade,and the organisations of traders were highly ordered. Egyptian geographer [[Ptolemy]], and the unknown author of [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]] has named this tract of the Bhojas as ''Arieke'' (Sodon).Their territory is also mentioned as a pirate coast of Satavahanas as well.&lt;ref name=goa&gt;{{cite book|last=De Souza|first=Teotonio R.|title=Goa Through the Ages: An economic history, Volume 2|date=Jan 1990|publisher=Concept Publishing Company, - Economic history -|isbn= 9788170222590|pages=117–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genealogy==
A number of Copper-plates found in Goa assigned to 4th to 7th century A.D. reveal names of Bhoja Kings.The relationship between these rulers and the names of earlier rulers are not known.The names  are as follows:
*Devaraja
*Asankita
*Asankitavarman
*Kapalivarman
*Prithvimallavarman

[[File:Le christianisme dévoilé.png|thumb|The original version of the book]]
'''''Christianity Unveiled, or examination of the principles and effects of the Christian religion''''' (''Le christianisme devoile, ou examination of principes et des effets de la religion chrétienne'') is a book that [[Criticism of Christianity|criticizes Christianity]] attributed to [[Baron d'Holbach]], probably published in 1766.&lt;ref&gt;''(in German) ''Naumann, Manfred: Zur Publikationsgeschichte des "Christianisme dévoilé" », dans Werner Krauss, Walter Dietze, Neue Beiträge zur Literatur der Aufklärung, p.155.  Ruetten &amp; Loening, Berlin 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

In his religious criticism, Holbach focuses on aspects of the [[Christian]] faith which he considers inconsistent, and is particularly critical of the moral and political influence of the Christian religion. The findings of the book are numerous correspondences in Holbach's later works, however, contain only latent atheistic utterances and are mainly focused at Christianity than to religion in general.

Unlike previous publications critical of religion, the book has no analysis of the historical origins of religions or the project of a deistic religion alternative to the content, but is seen as an outspoken anti-Christian propaganda piece. The book sparked in philosophical and enlightened circles and the lively reaction it received caused it to be seized immediately after its release by the French authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Charles Kors: D'Holbach's Coterie: An Enlightenment in Paris, S.  241st  Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1976, {{ISBN|0-691-05224-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12170">[[File:玫瑰聖母主教座堂.JPG|thumb|[[Holy Rosary Cathedral, Kaohsiung|Holy Rosary Cathedral]] in [[Kaohsiung]].]]

The [[Republic of China]], commonly known as Taiwan, has a Christian minority, making up about 4.5% of its population. Roughly half of Taiwan's Christians are Catholic, and half Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tw.html#People CIA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its minority status, Christianity has had a disproportionate influence on the island's culture and development, as illustrated by such exemplary figures as [[George Leslie Mackay]] (Presbyterian) and [[Nitobe Inazō]] (Methodist, later Quaker).

Several [[President of the Republic of China|Presidents]] have been at least nominal Christians, including the country's founder [[Sun Yat-sen]] ([[Congregationalist church|Congregationalist]]), [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] (both are Methodists) as well as [[Lee Teng-hui]] (Presbyterian). Former president, [[Ma Ying-jeou]], apparently received a Catholic baptism in his early teens, but does not identify with the religion. At the same time, the [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]] has been a key supporter of human rights and the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], a stance opposed to many of the politicians listed above.

==History==
Early Protestantism was driven out of Taiwan by the [[Ming Dynasty]] loyalist [[Koxinga]] in 1661, leaving no permanent religious influence. The 1860s saw the return of the Spanish Dominicans (via the Philippines), as well as the arrival of Presbyterian missionaries from England and Canada. One particular missionary, [[George Leslie Mackay]], founded the island's first university and hospital.

During the Japanese era (1895-1945), no new missions were allowed, with the result that Catholicism and Presbyterianism remain the largest Christian denominations. The development of Christianity took a whole new turn after 1949, when Christians of various denominations followed the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist]] army in its retreat to Taiwan. During the dictatorships of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], the [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]] became outspoken in its defense of democracy, human rights, and a Taiwanese identity. The number of denominations, and independent churches (often [[Evangelical]] or [[Charismatic]]), skyrocketed with the political liberalization and economic success of the 1980s.

Today, ROC government statistics estimate that Christians comprise some 4.5 percent of Taiwan's population, a figure which is about evenly divided between Protestants and Catholics. Nearly all of [[Formosan Aboriginals|Taiwan's aborigines]] profess Christianity (some 70 percent Presbyterianism, the remainder mostly Catholicism).

==Catholicism==
{{Main|Roman Catholicism in Taiwan}}
Taiwan has been part of a missionary jurisdiction since 1514, when it was included in the [[Diocese of Funchal]] (Portugal). In 1576, the first Chinese diocese was established in Macau, covering most of mainland China as well as Taiwan. The diocese was divided several times from the 16th century through the 19th; in chronological order, Taiwan belonged to the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nanking|Nanking]] (1660), Fukien (1696) and Amoy (1883). In 1913, the [[Apostolic Vicariate]] of the Island of Formosa (Taiwan) was established, being detached from the Diocese of Amoy. It was renamed for Kaohsiung in 1949.

Before the end of World War II, the Catholic Church had a very minor presence in Taiwan, based mainly in the south of the island and centered on Spanish Dominican priests who arrived from the Philippines in the 1860s. The following years saw a mass migration of religious communities from mainland China as Communist persecution began to take effect. As a result, the Catholic Church has many Mandarin-speaking postwar mainland immigrants and is under-represented among the native Taiwanese.

Since 1952, the [[Holy See–Taiwan relations|Papal Internuncio to China]] has been stationed in Taiwan, and now constitutes one of the last significant formal [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|diplomatic ties of the ROC]].

==Presbyterianism==
{{Main|Presbyterian Church in Taiwan}}
The first Presbyterian mission started in 1865, with the arrival of [[James Laidlaw Maxwell]] of the [[Presbyterian Church of England]] in Taiwan-fu ([[Tainan]]). His colleague [[George Leslie Mackay]] of the [[Presbyterian Church in Canada]] arrived in 1871, settling in [[Danshui]]. Mackay traveled widely throughout the island, and founded numerous churches. He also founded Tamsui Oxford College (now [[Aletheia University]]) in 1882, and [[Mackay Memorial Hospital]] (which NB, is named for a different Mackay) in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;MacKay, George Leslie. ''From Far Formosa''. 1895, 316.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] joined these northern and southern jurisdictions together as the [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]] (PCT). The PCT doubled its membership between 1955 and 1965, perhaps as a result of its outspoken support for democratization, human rights, and [[Taiwan independence]] (against the view of the [[Kuomintang]] regime that as a notional province of the [[Republic of China]], democratic elections in Taiwan would have to await the military reconquest of the mainland).

==Other Protestant==
A number of denominations (including the Baptist, Methodists, Episcopalians, Lutherans, and Adventists) arrived on the island in the wake of the expulsion of foreign missionaries from China, and the 1949 retreat of Nationalist troops to Taiwan. The same is true of [[Witness Lee]], protégé and co-worker of [[Watchman Nee]], founder of [[The Local Churches]] or [[Church Assembly Hall]] movement.

The [[Chinese Baptist Convention]] and its predecessors had been planning a Taiwan mission since 1936; its first missionary arrived in 1948. Activity swelled in the 1950s. Baptist churches being congregationally governed, the CBC is not so much a denomination as a cooperative association of independent churches. It supports Taiwan Baptist Theological Seminary (f. 1952).

Taiwan Methodists erected a Taipei church in 1953. The national organization gained autonomy in 1972, and installed its first bishop in 1986.

The [[Episcopal Diocese of Taiwan]] (est. 1954) belongs to Province VIII of the U.S. Episcopal Church.

The [[Taiwan Lutheran Church]] began meeting in 1951, and received formal recognition in 1954. One of several Lutheran denominations in Taiwan, it claims 18,000 baptized members.

The Adventists founded Taiwan Adventist College in 1951, and Taiwan Adventist Hospital in 1955. 
Taiwan Conservative Baptist Association in 1960
The [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]] arrived in 1963. It now claims a membership of approximately 2300 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmalliance.org/field/taiwan&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fellowship of [[Mennonite]] Churches in Taiwan (f. 1962) emerged from medical and relief projects carried out among Taiwan aborigines from 1948 (notably Hualian's [[Mennonite Christian Hospital]], f. 1954).  In 2004, it claimed 1658 adherents, concentrated in three major urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mennonitemission.net/OurWork/Partners/Pages/FellowshipofMennoniteChurchesinTaiwan.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224181557/http://www.mennonitemission.net/OurWork/Partners/Pages/FellowshipofMennoniteChurchesinTaiwan.aspx |archivedate=2015-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unification Church==
[[Moon Sun Myung]], founder of the [[Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity]], apparently visited Taiwan in 1965. A missionary was sent in 1967. The church received government recognition in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/fprint?ID=4264{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; only to be banned in 1975, then finally permitted again in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tparents.org/library/unification/talks/yong/Yong-111000.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern Orthodoxy==
{{Main|Eastern Orthodoxy in Taiwan}}
The history of [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity in Taiwan can be divided into three distinct phases. The first corresponds to the period of Japanese rule (1895-1945), when the first believers arrived on the island from Japan, and petitioned St. [[Nicholas of Japan]] to send them a priest. A Taiwan parish, named for Christ the Savior, was created in 1901.

The second period begins in 1949, with the arrival of some 5000 Russian emigres fleeing the [[Chinese Civil War]]. A House Church of St. John the Baptist was organized, and visited by various Orthodox dignitaries. At its height, this community numbered one or two hundred believers, and grew inactive during the 1980s. Sources differ as to whether these Russian believers had any contact with their Japanese coreligionists from the earlier period.

The third period begins in 2000, with the arrival of Fr. Jonah (Mourtos) to the island as a missionary priest under the [[Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia]] (itself under the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]]). Fr. Jonah established Taipei's Holy Trinity Orthodox Church, which formally registered with the government in 2003. Its congregation—a mixture of Russians and East Europeans, as well as Chinese and Western converts—numbers about 30 (rising to more than 100 at Christmas and Easter).

In 2012, the [[Moscow Patriarchate]], apparently in response to petitions from local Russians, "reactivated" the 1901 parish, and established (in Taipei) the Church of the Elevation of the Cross, with Fr. Kirill (Shkarbul) as its first priest. OMHKSEA Bishop Nektarios (Tsilis) of Hong Kong responded by objecting to what he sees as an uncanonical attempt to extend the territory of Moscow beyond its canonical jurisdiction, and by excommunicating Fr. Kirill and a parishioner. (The Moscow-affiliated church has not reciprocated.)

The '''Dutch Reformed Church of Surinam''' was founded in 1667 - 1668 by Rev Basselieres. It was a church of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] colonists. Now members are white settlers and ransomed slaves. Most church activities were in [[Paramaribo]]. Until 1850 the church was the State Church. The church opoened itself to the African slaves. The church has 15,000-12,000 members and 3 congregations and 5 house fellowships. The church subscribes the [[Apostles Creed]], [[Heidelberg Catechism]] and the [[Canons of Dort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecclesia-suriname.com/churches-in-suriname.php|title=The Ecclesia Suriname|publisher=|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=13296&amp;lg=de|title=Adressdatenbank reformierter Kirchen und Einrichtungen|first=Christoph|last=Fasse|publisher=|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In religion, a '''false prophet''' is one who falsely claims the gift of [[prophecy]] or [[Revelation|divine inspiration]], or who uses that gift for [[evil]] ends. Often, someone who is considered a "true [[prophet]]" by some people is simultaneously considered a "false prophet" by others, even within the same religion as the "prophet" in question. The term is sometimes applied outside religion to describe someone who fervently promotes a theory that the speaker thinks is false.

{{Christian Eschatology}}
[[File:B Facundus 220v.jpg|250px|thumb|''Fate of The False Prophet'', [[Events of Revelation#Chapter 16|Revelation 16]], Beatus de Facundus, 1047]]

Throughout the [[New Testament]], there are warnings of both false prophets and [[false Messiah]]s, and believers are adjured to be vigilant. The following verses ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|7:15-20|RSV}}) are from the [[Sermon on the Mount]]:

:"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit. A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will know them by their fruits."

The New Testament addresses the same point of a false prophet predicting correctly and Jesus predicted the future appearance of [[false Christ]]s and false prophets, affirming that they can perform great signs and miracles. The following verses are from the [[Olivet Discourse]]:

:"Take heed that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, ''I am the Christ'', and they will lead many astray. [...] Then if any one says to you, ''Lo, here is the Christ!'' or ''There he is!'', do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. Lo, I have told you beforehand. So, if they say to you, ''Lo, he is in the wilderness'', do not go out; if they say, ''Lo, he is in the inner rooms'', do not believe it." (Matthew {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|24:4-5|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|24:23-26|RSV}})

In the [[Gospel of Luke]], Jesus brought out an ethical application for his disciples using the analogy of false prophets in the Old Testament:

:"Woe to you, when all men speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets." ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Luke|6:26|RSV}})

In the [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Apostle Paul|Paul]] and [[Barnabas]] encountered a false prophet named [[Elymas|Elymas Bar-Jesus]] on the island of [[Cyprus]]:

:"When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus. He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith. But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him and said, “You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.” Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord." ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:6-12|RSV}})

This particular story likewise best matches the model found in [[Deuteronomy]]. The claim here is that Elymas is trying to turn [[Sergius Paulus]] from the true faith, just like the false prophet described in the preceding verses. In these verses, we do not see Elymas prophesying as the term is popularly understood, so the model seems to fit this scenario best.

The [[Second Epistle of Peter]] makes a comparison between false teachers and false prophets and how the former will bring in false teachings, just like the false prophets of old:

:"But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their licentiousness, and because of them the way of truth will be reviled. And in their greed they will exploit you with false words; from of old their condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction has not been asleep." ([[2 Peter]] {{Bibleverse-nb||2 Peter|2:1-3|RSV}})

The [[First Epistle of John]] warns those of the Christian faith to test every spirit because of these false prophets:

:"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God. This is the spirit of antichrist, of which you heard that it was coming, and now it is in the world already." ([[1 John]] {{Bibleverse-nb||1 John|4:1-3|RSV}})

===The false prophet of ''Revelation''===
One well-known New Testament false prophet is the false prophet mentioned in the [[Book of Revelation]]. The Apocalypse's false prophet is the agent of the [[The beast (Revelation)#Beast from the sea|Beast]], the [[Antichrist]], and he is ultimately cast with the Beast into the [[Lake of Fire#Christianity|lake of "fire and brimstone"]] ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|19:20|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|20:10|RSV}}). Another mention of a false prophet in the New Testament is an [[Antichrist|antichrist spirit]] which denies the Son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunny|first=Ahmad|date=19 Apr 2011|title=Prophet Muhammad in French and English Literature: 1650 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rE0xCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|location=|publisher=The Islamic Foundation|page=94|isbn=0860374785|author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|editor-last=Tolan|editor-first=John Victor|date=15 September 2000|title=Medieval Christian Perceptions of Islam: A Book of Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RAtEAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PG121|location=|publisher=Routledge|page=99|isbn=0415928923|author-link=John V.

==Islam==
{{See also|Islamic eschatology|List of Mahdi claimants|Prophets of Islam}}
The [[Quran]] portrays [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] as the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin|Seal of the Prophets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|33|40|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is understood by mainstream [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] Muslims to mean that anyone who claims to be a new prophet after him is a [[False messiah|false prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|128|e=129|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; All mainstream Muslim scholars' perspectives from both Sunni and Shia denominations do not see the second coming of the [[Messiah]] as the coming of a new prophet, as the Islamic Messiah [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] had already been an existing prophet, and will rule by the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah]] of [[Muhammad]], bringing no new revelation or prophecy.

Thawban ibn Kaidad narrated that Muhammad said;
{{Quote|"There will be 30 dajjals among my Ummah. Each one will claim that he is a prophet; but I am the last of the Prophets (Seal of the Prophets), and there will be no Prophet after me."|Related by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] as a sound hâdith.}}

[[Abu Hurairah]] narrated that Muhammad said;
{{Quote|"The Hour will not be established until two big groups fight each other whereupon there will be a great number of casualties on both sides and they will be following one and the same religious doctrine, until about 30 dajjals appear, and each of them will claim that he is Allah's Apostle..."|[[Sahih al-Bukhari]], Volume 9, Book 88: Afflictions and the End of the World, Hâdith Number 237.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|9|88|237}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Muhammad also stated that the last of these Dajjals would be the [[False Messiah]], [[Masih ad-Dajjal|al-Masih ad-Dajjal]] ([[Antichrist]]):

[[Samra ibn Jundab]] reported once Muhammad (while delivering a ceremonial speech at an occasion of a solar eclipse) said;
{{Quote|"Verily by Allah, the Last Hour will not come until 30 dajjals will appear and the final one will be the One-eyed False Messiah."|Related by [[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Imam Ahmed]] and [[Al-Tabarani|Imam Tabarani]] as a sound hâdith.}}

[[Anas ibn Malik]] narrated that Muhammad said;
{{Quote|1="There is never a prophet who has not warned the Ummah of that one-eyed liar; behold he is one-eyed and your Lord is not one-eyed.&lt;ref name="muslim1"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|41|7007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dajjal is blind of one eye&lt;ref name="muslim2"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|41|7009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his forehead are the letters [[K-F-R|k. f. r.]] ([[Kafir]])&lt;ref name="muslim1"/&gt; between the eyes of the Dajjal&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|41|7008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which every Muslim would be able to read."&lt;ref name="muslim2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=1704 |title=The Signs Before the Day of Judgment by Ibn Kathîr |publisher=Qa.sunnipath.com |date=2005-07-03 |accessdate=2012-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315191536/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=1704 |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;|2=[[Sahih Muslim]], Book 41: The Book Pertaining to the Turmoil and Portents of the Last Hour, Chapter 7: The Turmoil Would Go Like The Mounting Waves of the Ocean, Ahâdith 7007-7009.}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
Muslims believe that both Jesus and Mahdi will rid the world of wrongdoing, injustice and tyranny, ensuring peace and tranquility.&lt;ref name="Momen"&gt;Momen 1985: 166-8&lt;/ref&gt;

:"If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and announces to you a miraculous sign or wonder, and if the sign or wonder of which he has spoken takes place, and he says, 'Let us follow other gods' (gods you have not known) 'and let us worship them,' you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The Lord your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul. It is the Lord your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him. That prophet or dreamer must be put to death, because he preached rebellion against the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; he has tried to turn you from the way the Lord your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among you" ([[Deuteronomy]] 13:1–5 [[New International Version|NIV]]).

The [[Books of Kings]] records a story where, under duress from [[Ahab]], the prophet [[Micaiah]] depicts God as requesting information from his heavenly counsel as to what he should do with a court of false prophets. This depiction is recorded in [[1 Kings]] 22:19–23:
: "Micaiah continued, 'Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left.' And the Lord said, 'Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?'"
: "One suggested this, and another that. Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord and said, 'I will entice him.'"
: "'By what means?' the Lord asked."
: "'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said."
: "'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the Lord. 'Go and do it.'"
: "So now the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you" ([[1 Kings]] 22:19–23 [[New International Version|NIV]]).

It is possible that Micaiah meant to depict the false prophets as a test from YHWH. It is also possible that it was meant as a slur on Ahab's prophets, such as Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Cogan, 1 Kings: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary, Anchor Bible Commentaries, Yale 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The penalty for false prophecy, including speaking in the name of a god other than YHWH or speaking presumptuously in YHWH's name, [[List of capital crimes in the bible|is capital punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Deut|18:20|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, if a prophet makes a [[prophecy]] in the name of YHWH that does not come to pass, that is another sign that he is not commissioned of YHWH and that the people need not fear the false prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Deut|18:22|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jewish Koine Greek]] term ''pseuoprophetes'' occurs in the [[Septuagint]] Jeremiah 6:13, 33:8,11 34:7, 36:1,8, Zechariah 13:2, Josephus' Antiquities 8-13-1,10-7-3, War of the Jews 6-5-2, and Philo Specific Laws 3:8. Classical pagan writers use the term ''pseudomantis''.

==Use outside religion==
The term ''false prophet'' is sometimes applied outside religion, to describe promoters of scientific, medical, or political theories which the author of the phrase thinks are false. [[Paul Offit]]'s 2008 book ''[[Autism's False Prophets]]'' applied the phrase to promoters of unproven theories and therapies such as the [[thiomersal controversy]] and [[chelation therapy]]. [[Ronald Bailey]]'s 1993 book ''Ecoscam: The False Prophets of Ecological Apocalypse'' applied the phrase to promoters of the [[global warming]] hypothesis; however, by 2005 Bailey had changed his mind, writing "Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Reason |author= Bailey R |title= We're all global warmers now |date=2005-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Felix Nussbaum''' (11 December 1904 – 9 August 1944) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Jewish]] [[surrealist]] [[Painting|painter]]. Nussbaum’s artwork gives a rare glimpse into the essence of one individual among the victims of the [[Holocaust]].

== Early life and education ==
Nussbaum was born in [[Osnabrück]], [[Germany]], as the son of Rahel and Philipp Nussbaum.  Philipp was a [[World War I]] veteran and [[Germany|German]] patriot before the rise of the [[Nazis]].  He was an amateur painter when he was younger, but was forced to pursue other means of work for financial reasons.  He therefore encouraged his son’s artwork passionately.

Nussbaum was a lifelong student, beginning his formal studies in 1920 in [[Hamburg]] and [[Berlin]], and continuing as long as the contemporary political situation allowed him.  In his earlier works, Nussbaum was heavily influenced by [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Henri Rousseau]] and he eventually paid homage to [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and [[Carlo Carrà]] as well.  [[Carl Hofer]]’s [[expressionist]] painting influenced Felix’s careful approach to color.

In 1933, Nussbaum was studying under a scholarship in [[Rome]] at the Berlin Academy of the Arts when the [[Nazi]]s gained control of Germany.  [[Adolf Hitler]] sent his Minister of Propaganda to Rome in April to explain to the artist elites how a Nazi artist was to develop, which entailed promoting heroism and the [[Aryan]] race. Nussbaum realised at this point that, as a Jew, he could not remain at the academy.

== Deportation to death camps ==
[[Image:Berlin GTafel Nussbaum.jpg|thumb|Plaque in front of former residence in [[Berlin-Wilmersdorf]]]]

[[File:Felix Nussbaum, Stazione ferroviaria di Alassio, 1933.jpeg|thumb|Alassio railway station. In this painting Nussbaum shows the sadness which afflicts him during the forced exile caused by the persecution of the Nazis.]]
The next decade of Nussbaum's life was characterised by fear, which is reflected in his artwork. In 1934 he took {{Interlanguage link multi|Felka Platek|de}}, a painter whom he had met while studying in Berlin and would later marry during their exile in [[Brussels]] in 1937, to meet his parents in [[Switzerland]]. Felix's parents eventually grew homesick for Germany and, against his fierce objections,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/nussbaum/about_nussbaum.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki Felix Nussbaum&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www1.yadvashem.org&lt;/ref&gt; they returned. This was the last time Felix would see his mother and father — the source of his spiritual and financial support. Felix and Felka would spend the next ten years in exile, mostly in Belgium, a period of emotional and artistic isolation for him but also one of the most artistically productive in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts in Exile|url=http://kuenste-im-exil.de/KIE/Content/EN/Persons/nussbaum-felix-en.html|work=Arts in Exile|publisher=German National Library|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nazi Germany attacked Belgium in 1940, Nussbaum was arrested by Belgian police as a "hostile alien" German, and was subsequently taken to the [[Saint-Cyprien, Pyrénées-Orientales|Saint-Cyprien]] camp in [[Vichy France|France]]. The desperate circumstances in the camp influenced his pictures of that time. He eventually signed a request to the French camp authorities to be returned to Germany. On the train ride from Saint Cyprien to Germany, he managed to escape and rendezvous with Felka in [[Brussels]], and they began a life in hiding. Without residency papers, Nussbaum had no way of earning an income, but friends provided him with shelter and art supplies so that he could continue his craft. The darkness of the next four years of his life can be seen in the expression of his artwork from that period.

1944 was the year in which the plans of Nazi Germany had the greatest impact on the Nussbaum family. Philipp and Rahel Nussbaum were killed at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] in February. In July, Nussbaum and his wife were found hiding in an attic by German armed forces. They were arrested, sent to the [[Mechelen transit camp]] and given the numbers XXVI/284 and XXVI/285. On August 2 they arrived at Auschwitz, and a week later Felix was murdered at the age of 39. On September 3, Nussbaum’s brother was sent to Auschwitz, and on September 6 his sister-in-law and niece were also murdered there. In December, his brother – the last of the family – died from exhaustion in the [[Stutthof concentration camp|camp at Stutthof]]. Within one year, the entire Nussbaum family had been murdered.

==Major works==
In this time period, Nussbaum created two of his best-known works: ''Self Portrait with Jewish Identity Card'' (1943), and ''Triumph of Death'' (1944).

=== ''Triumph of Death'' ===

[[File:'Triumph des Todes (Die Gerippe spielen zum Tanz)', 1944 by Felix Nussbaum.jpg|thumb|''{{lang|de|Triumph des Todes (Die Gerippe spielen zum Tanz)}}'' ("Triumph of Death (The skeletons play to the dance)"), 1944]]

''Triumph of Death'' shows Nussbaum's attention to detail. According to his biography, ''Felix Nussbaum: Art Defamed; Art in Exile; Art in Resistance'', the crumpled music score has the first several bars of "[[The Lambeth Walk]]", a popular song from the musical ''[[Me and My Girl]]''. The words that would normally accompany the music are "Ev'rythin' free and easy / Do as you darn well please".

== Legacy ==
[[Image:FelixNussbaumHaus.jpg|thumb|[[Felix Nussbaum Haus]] in [[Osnabrück]]]]

Felix Nussbaum’s artwork affords a rare glimpse into the mind of one individual among the victims of the [[Holocaust]]. In 1998, the [[Felix Nussbaum Haus]] in Osnabrück opened its doors to exhibit the artworks of Felix Nussbaum.

He was featured alongside fellow concentration camp survivors and artists [[Jan Komski]] and [[Dinah Gottliebova]] in the 1999 documentary film ''[[Eyewitness (1999 film)|Eyewitness]]'', which was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/300861/Eyewitness/details |title=NY Times: Eyewitness |accessdate=2008-12-06|work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=7thart&gt;{{cite web|title=Eyewitness|url=http://www.7thart.com/films/Eyewitness|publisher=Seventh Art Releasing|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Art and Remembrance: The Legacy of Felix Nussbaum]]'' is a 1993 documentary directed by Barbara Pfeffer.

The '''Four Books and Five Classics''' ({{zh|t=四書五經|p=Sìshū wǔjīng}}) are the authoritative books of [[Confucianism]] in [[China]] written before 300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historia Religionum, Volume 2 Religions of the Present|author=Bleeker, C. J. and G. Widengren|publisher=BRILL|year=1971|isbn=90-04-02598-7|page=478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four Books==
The '''Four Books''' ({{zh|t=四書|p=Sìshū|labels=no}}) are [[Chinese classic texts]] illustrating the core value and belief systems in [[Confucianism]]. They were selected by [[Zhu Xi]] in the [[Song dynasty]] to serve as general introduction to Confucian thought, and they were, in the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, made the core of the official curriculum for the [[Imperial examination|civil service examinations]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, translated and edited, ''The Four Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  They are:

;''[[Great Learning]]''
:Originally one chapter in the ''[[Book of Rites]]''. It consists of a short main text attributed to [[Confucius]] and nine commentary chapters by [[Zeng Zi]], one of the [[disciples of Confucius]].  Its importance is illustrated by Zeng Zi's foreword that this is the gateway of learning. &lt;br&gt;It is significant because it expresses many themes of Chinese philosophy and political thinking, and has therefore been extremely influential both in classical and modern Chinese thought. Government, self-cultivation and investigation of things are linked. 
&lt;!-- (can be devoted to the respective articles instead)
It links together individual action in the form of self-cultivation with higher goals such as ultimate world peace as well as linking together the spiritual and the material.  In addition, by defining the path of learning (dao) in governmental and social terms, ''the Great Learning'' both links the spiritual with the practical, and creates a vision of [[Tao|dao]] that is radically different from that presented by [[Daoism]].  In particular, ''the Great Learning'' sets Confucianism as being this-worldly rather than other-worldly.  Finally, ''the Great Learning'' also creates a conservative political discourse.  Instead of basing its authority on an external deity, the Great Learning bases its authority on the practices of ancient kings.
--&gt; 
;''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]''
:Another chapter in ''[[Book of Rites]]'', attributed to [[Confucius]]' grandson [[Zisi]]. The purpose of this small, 33-chapter book is to demonstrate the usefulness of a golden way to gain perfect virtue. It focuses on the [[Tao|Way]] (道) that is prescribed by a heavenly mandate not only to the ruler but to everyone. To follow these heavenly instructions by learning and teaching will automatically result in a Confucian virtue. Because Heaven has laid down what is the way to perfect virtue, it is not that difficult to follow the steps of the holy rulers of old if one only knows what is the right way.
;''[[Analects]]''
:A compilation of speeches by [[Confucius]] and his disciples, as well as the discussions they held. Since Confucius's time, the ''Analects'' has heavily influenced the philosophy and moral values of [[China]] and later other [[East Asia]]n countries as well. The [[Imperial examinations]], started in the [[Sui dynasty]] and eventually abolished with the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], emphasized Confucian studies and expected candidates to quote and apply the words of Confucius in their essays.
&lt;!--
A particular point of interest lies in Chapter X of the book, which contains detailed descriptions of Confucius's behaviors in various daily activities. This has been pointed at by [[Voltaire]] and [[Ezra Pound]] to show how much Confucius was a mere human. [[Simon Leys]], who recently translated ''Analects'' into French and English, said that the book may well have been the first in human history to describe the life of a man.
--&gt;
;''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]''
:A collection of conversations of the scholar [[Mencius]] with kings of his time. In contrast to the sayings of [[Confucius]], which are short and self-contained, the ''Mencius'' consists of long dialogues with extensive prose.
&lt;!--
Mencius argued that human beings are born with an innate moral sense, but that society corrupted it through lack of a positive cultivating influence. Therefore, the goal of moral cultivation is to return to the people's innate morality. Consistent with his belief in the individual, Mencius contended that it was permissible for people to overthrow or kill a ruler who ignored the public's needs or ruled harshly.
--&gt;

==Five Classics==
The '''Five Classics''' ({{zh|t=五經|p=Wǔ Jīng|labels=no}}) are five pre-[[Qin dynasty|Qin]] Chinese books that form part of the traditional Confucian canon. Several of the texts were already prominent by the [[Warring States period]]. [[Mencius]], the leading Confucian scholar of the time, regarded the ''Spring and Autumn Annals'' as being equally important as the semi-legendary chronicles of earlier periods. During the [[Han dynasty|Western Han dynasty]], which adopted Confucianism as its official ideology, these texts became part of the state-sponsored curriculum. It was during this period that the texts first began to be considered together as a set collection, and to be called collectively the "Five Classics".&lt;ref&gt;Nylan, Michael. [https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205031/http://yalepress.yale.edu/YupBooks/pdf/0300081855.pdf (Internet Archive Copy) ''The Five "Confucian" Classics'']. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Classics are:

;''[[Classic of Poetry]]''
:A collection of 305 poems divided into 160 folk songs, 105 festal songs sung at court ceremonies, and 40 hymns and eulogies sung at sacrifices to heroes and ancestral spirits of the royal house. 
;''[[Book of Documents]]''
:A collection of documents and speeches alleged to have been written by rulers and officials of the early Zhou period and before. It is possibly the oldest Chinese narrative, and may date from the 6th century BC.  It includes examples of early Chinese prose.
;''[[Book of Rites]]''
:Describes ancient rites, social forms and court ceremonies. The version studied today is a re-worked version compiled by scholars in the third century BC rather than the original text, which is said to have been edited by Confucius himself. 
;''[[I Ching]]'' (''Book of Changes'')
:The book contains a [[divination]] system comparable to Western [[geomancy]] or the West African [[Ifá]] system. In [[Western world|Western]] cultures and modern East Asia, it is still widely used for this purpose.
;''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''
:A historical record of the [[State of Lu]], Confucius's native state, 722–481 BC.

The ''[[Classic of Music]]'' is sometimes considered the sixth classic but was lost in the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|Burning of the Books]].

Up to the Western Han, authors would typically list the Classics in the order Poems-Documents-Rituals-Changes-Spring&amp;Autumn. However, from the Eastern Han the default order instead became Changes-Documents-Poems-Rituals-Spring&amp;Autumn.

Authors and editors of later eras have also appropriated the terms "Book" and "Classic" and applied them ironically to compendia focused on patently low-brow subject matter. Examples include the ''Classic of Whoring'' (''Piao jing'' 嫖經) and Zhang Yingyu's ''A New Book for Foiling Swindles'' (''Du pian xin shu'' 杜騙新書, ca. 1617), which is known colloquially as ''[[The Book of Swindles]]'' or ''The Classic of Swindles''.

==Authorship of the Classics==
Traditionally, it was thought that Confucius himself had compiled or edited the texts of the Five Classics. The scholar Yao Hsin-chung allows that there are good reasons to believe that Confucian classics took shape in the hands of Confucius, but that “nothing can be taken for granted in the matter of the early versions of the classics.” From the time of the Western Han dynasty, Yao continues, most Confucian scholars believed that Confucius re-collected and edited the prior works, thereby “fixing” the versions of the ancient writings which became the Classics. In the twentieth century, many Chinese scholars still held to this tradition. The [[New Confucianism|New Confucian]] scholar, [[Xiong Shili]] (1885 -1968), for instance, held that the Six Classics were the final versions "fixed up" &lt;!-- "fixed up" is Yao's term --&gt; by Confucius in his old age. Other scholars had and have different views. The [[Old Texts|Old Text School]], for instance, relied on versions found in the Han dynasty which supposedly survived the Qin dynasty [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|burning of the books]] but many of them held that these works had not been edited by Confucius but survived directly from the [[Zhou dynasty]].

For quite different reasons, mainly having to do with [[Doubting Antiquity School|modern textual scholarship]], a greater number of twentieth century scholars both in China and in other countries hold that Confucius had nothing to do with editing the classics, much less writing them. Yao Hsin-chung reports that still other scholars hold the “pragmatic” view that the history of the Classics is a long one and that Confucius and his followers, although they did not intend to create a system of classics,  “contributed to their formation.”&lt;ref&gt;Hsin-chung Yao, An Introduction to Confucianism (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000), pp. 52-54.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, it is undisputed that for most of the last 2,000 years, Confucius was believed to have either written or edited these classics.

The most important events in the textual career of these classics were the adoption of Confucianism as state orthodoxy in the [[Han dynasty]], which led to their preservation, and the “renaissance” of Confucianism in the [[Song dynasty]], which led to their being made the basis of Confucian orthodoxy in the [[Imperial examinations|imperial examination system]] in the following dynasties. The [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] sage [[Zhu Xi]] (1130-1200) fixed the texts of the Four Books and wrote commentaries whose new interpretations became accepted as being those of Confucius himself.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel K. Gardner. ''The Four Books: The Basic Teachings of the Later Confucian Tradition''. Indianapolis: Hackett, 2007. {{ISBN|9780872208261}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hinduism in Israel''' refers to the [[Hindu]] population in [[Israel]].  
== Hare Krishnas ==
A group of devotees is living in [[Katzir-Harish]]. Another Vaishnava community in Israel is in [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]]. It is spearheaded by Jagadish and his wife, Jugala-Priti, and serves a growing community of devotees from Russia who immigrated to Israel to escape the severe economic oppression in the CIS. Jugala-Priti joined the ISKCON center in Tel Aviv, in 1996 guided by Gunavatar and Varshabhanavi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wavesofdevotion.com/journal/2002/05/|title=Waves of Devotion - Journals: May 2002 Archives|website=www.wavesofdevotion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu festivals in Israel==
===Krishna Janmashtami===
Hindus are able to practice freely in the country. This is notably shown by the celebrations of [[Krishna Janmashtami]]. Plays are staged revolving around stories of Krishna's childhood, besides singing and dancing. The event is accompanied with a feast of 108 dishes, a number that has come to be identified as pious by the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=6636&amp;sec=28&amp;con=35|title=Janmashtami celebrated in Israel with fanfare|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisers said they were inspired by Kumbh and started the event in Israel three years ago. Many of the visitors at the festival have been to India or are planning to visit. A number of youngsters could be seen taking [[Yoga]] classes and attending Hare Krishna lectures. Long queues were to be found outside the Indian ‘[[dhaba]]’ serving boiled rice and lentil soup. Middle aged couples, draped in Indian clothes, strolled the beach, young boys and girls drew circles on the soft sand while others surfed the morning sea.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=13390&amp;sec=51&amp;con=35 Impressed by the Kumbh, Israelis organise [[Boombamela]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sai Organisation in Israel==
Sai Organisation was officially established in Israel in 2001.[http://www.sathyasai.org.il/index.htm]

== Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Organisation in Israel ==
The center is a branch of Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre International, founded by [[Vishnudevananda Saraswati|Swami Vishnudevananda]], a direct disciple of [[Sivananda Saraswati|Sri Swami Sivananda]], of Rishikesh, India.

The center opened in 1971 and since then the center has been the largest and most comprehensive school in Israel for the study and practice of classical yoga in all its branches, including:
* Practice Asanas (Yoga Postures)
* Pranayama (breathing yoga)
* Science of yogic stress management
* Yogic vegetarian diet
* Positive thinking
* And classical meditation

=== Centres ===
Since 1971, their activities have expanded significantly and more centers are now operating in the following cities
* [[Jerusalem]]
* [[Pardes Hanna-Karkur|Pardes]]
* [[Eilat]]
* [[Tivon]]
Thousands of Israelis have been trained as yoga teachers on behalf of the international organization and are working and teaching throughout the country.

=== Sivananda Yoga Center in Tel Aviv ===
The Sivananda Yoga Center in Tel Aviv is no longer a yoga studio. 

The school is located in a three-story building designed for:
* Classical yoga classes for children, pregnant women, special needs and more
* Workshops and yoga courses in a variety of levels
* Workshops and meditation courses
* Positive thinking courses
* Sub-conscious tutorials and working with guided imagery
* Cooking workshops Yogi vegetarian
* With healthy stress management and relaxation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1818">The '''International UFO Congress''' is an organization in [[Arizona]] dedicated to the dissemination of information related to many aspects of [[ufology]]. It was established in 1991 and hosts an annual conference. Previously held in [[Laughlin, Nevada]], the conference moved to the [[Phoenix, Arizona]] area in 2011. It features presentations given by authors, researchers, experts, enthusiasts, and those who claim to have witnessed [[paranormal]] or anomalous phenomena from all over the world. This week-long event usually has over thirty speakers, a film festival, vendors, and "experiencer" and findings-discussion sessions. Topics generally covered are [[alien abduction]], UFO sightings, UFO crashes, [[crop circle]]s, paranormal experiences, and government conspiracy.

==Congress history==
The International UFO Congress was owned by the Brown family{{which?|date=May 2017}}, who in 2010 turned over the conference to [[Open Minds Production]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufocongress.com/pdf/2010_IUFOC_Brochure.pdf UFO Congress 2010 UFO congress 2010 Brochure]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{islam by country}}
The earliest presence of '''[[Islam]] in [[Chad]]''' can be traced back to the legendary [[Uqba ibn Nafi]], whose descendants can be found settled in the [[Lake Chad]] region to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://san.beck.org/1-12-Africato1500.html|title=Africa to 1500|last1=Sanderson|first1=Beck}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time [[Arab]] migrants began arriving from the east in the fourteenth century in sizeable numbers, the creed was already well established. Islamization in Chad was gradual, the effect of the slow spread of Islamic civilization beyond its political frontiers.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;Library of Congress., and Thomas Collelo. Chad, a country study. 2nd ed. Washington D.C.: Federal Research Division Library of Congress  ;For sale by the Supt. of Docs.  U.S. G.P.O, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the majority of Chadians are Muslims (55.7%), the vast majority of whom are [[Sunni]] of [[Maliki]] [[madhhab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/the-worlds-muslims-full-report.pdf | title=The World's Muslims: Unity and Diversity | accessdate=August 14, 2012 | date=August 9, 2012 | publisher=Pew Forum on Religious &amp; Public life}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chad, 55% of Muslims belong to a Sufi [[Tariqah]] (order).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Muslims: Unity and Diversity|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Muslim/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation.aspx|publisher=The Pew Forum: On Religion and Public Life|accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Islam in Chad was not influenced much by the great mystical movements of the Islamic [[Middle Ages]], nor the fundamentalist upheavals that affected other countries. Consistent contact with [[West Africa]]n Muslim traders and pilgrims may be the reason Chadian Muslims identify with the [[Tijaniyya]] order. Similarly, in the mid-nineteenth century, the [[Sanusiyya]] brotherhood was founded in Libya, which benefited from economic and political influence in the [[Lake Chad Basin]] around 1900. An Islamic revival movement, feared by some French, led by [[Senussi|Sanusi]] fanatics, Chadian adherents, limited to the Awlad Sulayman Arabs and the [[Toubou]] of eastern [[Tibesti]], have never been numerous.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt;{{rp|72}}

Higher Islamic education in Chad is sparse; thus, serious Islamic students and scholars must travel to other countries.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt;{{rp|72}} Scholars travel abroad to places such as [[Khartoum]] and [[Cairo]], where Chadians attend [[Al Azhar]].&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt;{{rp|72}}

Chadians observe the five pillars of the faith differently than the orthodox version. Prayer, both public and communal, occur more than once a week, but often not in a [[mosque]]. Chadian Muslims likely make the pilgrimage less often than [[Hausa people|Hausans]] in northern [[Nigeria]]. Some Chadian Muslims follow the Ramadan fast stricter than typical, with some refusing to swallow their saliva during the day.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt;{{rp|72}}

[[Image:Togo Mosque.jpg|thumb|left|Mosque in northern Togo]]
'''[[Muslims]] in [[Togo]]''' represent between 12 and 20% of the national population. [[Islam]] came to Togo about the same time as it did much of [[West Africa]]. The vast majority of Muslims in Togo are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] of [[Maliki]] school of [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;CIA=Togo&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Islam was first introduced into West Africa south of the [[Sahara]], across the salt and gold trade routes. Islamicized [[Berber people|Berber]] and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] merchants traveled the trans-Saharan trade routes. As time passed, Muslim clerics and scholars — teaching their beliefs and setting up places of worship along the routes — accompanied traders on their journeys. The [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and the [[Fulani people|Fulani]], a traditionally nomadic group, traveled all over West Africa, taking their Muslim beliefs to places such as present-day [[Guinea]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Liberia]].

==Demographics==
Estimates on the number of Muslims in Togo vary depending on the source. The [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/to.html#People CIA World Factbook] puts the figure is 20%. A survey by the [[Pew Research Center]] gives an estimate of 12.2% of the population or 809,000 individuals as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|editor-last=Miller |editor-first=Tracy |date=October 2009 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |title=Mapping the Global Muslim Population: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World’s Muslim Population |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |url=http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |accessdate=2013-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010050756/http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kamakhya'''  ({{lang-as|কামাখ্যা দেৱী}}), also known as '''Siddha Kubjika''', is an important Hindu [[Tantra|Tantric]] goddess of desire who evolved in the Himalayan hills. She is worshiped as Siddha Kubjika, and is also identified as [[Kali]] and Maha [[Tripura Sundari]]. According to the Tantric texts (''[[Kalika Purana]]'', ''[[Yogini Tantra]]'') that are the basis for her worship at the [[Kamakhya temple]], a 16th-century temple in the [[Kamrup Rural district|Kamrup]] district of [[Assam]]. The earlier manifest of the goddess sanctified at the [[Garo hills]] is destroyed, although the [[Vatsayana]] priests are said to have carried away the manifest of the goddess to the Hindu kingdom in Kashmir and later sanctified in a remote hill forest in Himachal. Her name means "renowned goddess of desire," and she resides at the presently rebuilt [[Kamakhya Temple]] in 1645 C. The temple is primary amongst the 51 [[Shakti Peethas]] related to the sect that follows [[Dakshayani|Sati]], and remains one of the most important [[Shakta]] temples and [[Hindu]] pilgrimage sites in the world.

== Origins ==

The origin of worship 'Shakti' at the site is associated with the legend of [[Dakshayani|Sati]], who was the wife of the ascetic god [[Shiva]] and daughter of the [[Purana|Puranic]] god-king [[Daksha]]. Daksha was unhappy with his daughter's choice of husband, and when he performed a grand [[Yajna]] for all the deities, he did not invite [[Shiva]] or [[Dakshayani|Sati]]. In a rage, Sati threw herself onto the fire, knowing that this would make the sacrifice impure. Because she was the all-powerful mother goddess, Sati left her body in that moment to be reborn as the goddess [[Parvati]]. Meanwhile, [[Shiva]] was stricken with grief and rage at the loss of his wife. He put Sati's body over his shoulder and began his ''[[tandava]]'' (dance of cosmic destruction) throughout the heavens, and vowed not to stop until the body was completely rotted away. The other Gods, afraid of their annihilation, implored [[Vishnu]] to pacify Shiva. Thus, wherever Shiva wandered while dancing, Vishnu followed. He sent his discus Sudarshana to destroy the corpse of Sati. Pieces of her body fell until Shiva was left without a body to carry. Seeing this, Shiva sat down to do ''Mahatapasya'' (great penance). Despite the similarity in name, scholars do not generally believe that this legend gave rise to the practice of sati or the voluntary giving of the wife's body on the pyre of her husband .&lt;ref&gt;J.S. Hawley, ''Sati, the Blessing and the Curse.'' Oxford University Press (New York: 1994). p. 50-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to various myths and traditions, there are 51 pieces of Sati's body scattered across the Indian subcontinent. These places are called shakti peethas and are dedicated to various powerful goddesses. [[Kamarupa]] ("form of desire") is the region in which the ''yoni'' ("vulva," "womb," or "source") is said to have fallen to earth, and the Kamakhya temple was said to have been constructed on this spot.

== Identity ==

Kamakhya is mentioned in the ''[[Kalika Purana]]'' as the most important goddess of Tantric worship, and is referred to in the text as ''Mahamaya'', the "great goddess of illusion", who takes on many forms depending on her mood. Devotees also call her Kameshwari ("beloved goddess of desire"), and consider her a form of Maha [[Tripura Sundari]], also called Shodashi. She is identified with Kali in the ''Kalika Purana'', Yoginitantra'' and ''Kamakhya Tantra'', each of which echoes this verse:&lt;ref&gt;B. Shastri. ''Kamakhya Tantra.'' Bharatiy Vidya Prakash (Delhi, Varanasi: 1990). p. 20. &lt;br /&gt;
yā devi kālikā mātā sarva vidyāsvarūpinī |&lt;br /&gt;
kāmākhyā saiva vikhyātā satyam devi nacānyathā ||&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is certainly well known that Kamakhya is truly none other than that mother goddess Kali, who is in all things the form of wisdom."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kamakhya is associated with the Dasa [[Mahavidyas]], who each have temples dedicated to them at the Kamakhya temple complex in Assam. She is also closely associated with [[Durga]].

'''Four Adi Shakti Peethas'''

The great mythological texts including the Kalika Purana (the Asthashakti) and various Tantras recognize the four major Shakti Peethas as Adi Shakti Peethas. Like ([[Bimala]], Pada Khanda) inside the Jagannath Temple, Puri, Odisha, ([[Tara Tarini]]) Sthana Khanda (Breasts), near Brahmapur, Odisha, (Kamakhya, Yoni khanda) in Guwahati, Assam and ([[Dakhina Kalika]], Mukha khanda) in Kolkata, West Bengal originated from the limbs of the Corpse of Mata Sati. In a hymn, the Kalika Purana (Asthashakti) clearly says:

[[“Vimala Pada khandancha,

Stana khandancha Tarini (Tara Tarini),

Kamakhya Yoni khandancha,

Mukha khandancha Kalika (Kali)

Anga pratyanga sangena

Vishnu Chakra Kshate nacha……”]]

'''Peetha	    Body Part	Place

Vimala	        Pada khanda	Puri, Odisha

Tara Tarini	Stana khanda	Brahmapur, Odisha

Kamakhya	Yoni khanda	Guwahati, Assam

Dakshina Kalika	Mukha khanda	Kolkata, West Bengal
'''

Mantras for general worship of the Mahavidyas at the Kamakhya temple complex reveal a close identity with Kamakhya herself. Several of these goddesses are worshipped as forms of Kamakhya explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;''Viswa Shanti Devi Yajna.'' Viswa Shanti Devi Yajna Committee. Mandala Communications (Guwahati: 2004). pp. 22-8.&lt;/ref&gt;
Devi Kamakhya's 'Ashtashaktis' or eight incarnations are Guptakama,Srikama,Vindhyavasini,Kotishvari,Vanadurga,Padadurga,Dirgheshvari and Bhuvaneshvari.

==Legend==
Once [[Narakasura]], motivated by his carnal desire, wanted to marry Devi Kamakhya. When proposed, the Goddess playfully put a condition before him that if he would be able to build a staircase from the bottom of the Nilachal Hill to the temple within one night before the cock crows to indicate Dawn, then she would surely marry him.
Naraka took it as a challenge and tried all with his might to do this huge task. He was almost about to accomplish the job before it was dawn. When Kamakhya Devi got this news, she playfully strangled a cock and made it crow untimely to give the impression of Dawn to Naraka. Duped by the trick even Naraka thought that it was a futile job and left it halfway through. Now the place is known as Kukurakata situated in the district of Darrang. The incomplete staircase is known as Mekhelauja Path.&lt;ref&gt;Kāmarūpa Anusandhān Samiti (2007),''Journal of the Assam Research Society - Volume 38'',p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Drunk with power, as he knew himself to be unrivalled in prowess, he brought all the kingdoms on earth under his control. Next, he turned his eyes towards [[Svarga|Swargaloka]]. Even the mighty [[Indra]] could not withstand the assault of this son of [[Vishnu]] and had to flee the heavens. 
Narakasura had become the overlord of both the heavens and earth. Addicted to power, he stole the earrings of [[Aditi]], the heavenly mother goddess, and usurped some of her territory, while also kidnapping [[Junior wives of Krishna|16000 women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swami|first=Parmeshwaranand|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of the Puranas|year=2001|publisher=Sarup and Sons|location=New Delhi|isbn=8176252263|page=941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], led by [[Indra]], went to Vishnu to ask him to deliver them from Narakasura. Vishnu promised them that he would attend to this matter, when he would be incarnated as [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;B. K. Chaturvedi (2017), ''Vishnu Puran''&lt;/ref&gt;

As promised to Mother Earth, Narakasura was allowed to enjoy a long reign. At last Vishnu was born as Krishna. Aditi, who was a relative of Krishna's wife [[Satyabhama]] (believed to be an Avatar of [[Bhudevi]] - Narakasura' mother), approached Satyabhama for help. When Satyabhama heard of the Narakasura's ill treatment of women and his behaviour with Aditi, she was enraged. Satyabhama approached Lord Krishna for permission to wage a war against Narakasura. As promised to the Devas and Aditi, Krishna attacked the great fortress of Narakasura, riding his mount [[Garuda]] with wife Satyabhama.
Lord Krishna used the Narayanastra and the Agneyastra against the army of Narakasura.
The battle was furiously fought. Narakasura possessed 11 [[Akshauhini]]s that he unleashed on Lord Krishna. However, the Lord slew them all with little effort. Lord Krishna also killed Mura, Narakasura's general. Thus Krishna is called 'Murāri' (the killer of Mura).&lt;ref&gt;Dianne M. MacMillan (2008), ''Diwali: Hindu Festival of Lights'', p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

Narakasura used several divine weapons against Lord Krishna, but Krishna easily neutralised all those weapons. Narakasura used the Brahmastra against Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with his own Brahmastra. Narakasura used the Agneyastra against Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with the Varunastra. Narakasura used the Nagapasha against Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with the Garudastra. In desperation, Narakasura launched the Vaishnavastra on Lord Krishna, but Lord Krishna neutralised it with another Vaishnavastra. At last, when Narakasura tried to kill Lord Krishna with a trident, Lord Krishna beheaded him with his Sudarshana Chakra (discus).
Everything happened because of the maya made by the Goddess Kamakhya.&lt;ref&gt;Ayilam Subrahmaṇya Pañcāpageśa Ayyar (1957), ''Sri Krishna: The Darling of Humanity'', p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Narakasura's death, he requested a boon from his mother, Satyabhama, that everyone should celebrate his death with colorful light. Thus this day is celebrated as '[[Naraka Chaturdashi]]' - the day before [[Diwali]]. Krishna's and Satyabhama's victory on Narakasura translated into freedom for all his prisoners and honoring of Aditi. Having rescued the 16,100 women, Krishna married them to restore them to their former dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel Marion Underhill (1991), ''The Hindu Religious Year'', p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography ==

Kamakhya is pictured as a young goddess, 16&amp;nbsp;years old, with twelve arms and six heads of varying colors, representing a powerful goddess who is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. She is ornately dressed, typically wearing a red sari, opulent jewelry and red flowers such as hibiscus.

She holds in each of ten hands a lotus, trident, sword, bell, discus, bow, arrows, club or scepter, goad, and shield. Her remaining two hands hold a bowl, which is made either of gold or a skull.

She is seated upon a lotus, which emerges from the navel of Lord [[Shiva]], who in turn lies atop a lion.

To each side of her sit [[Brahma]] and [[Vishnu]], who are each seated upon a lotus, as well.

{{IndicText}}

'''Kapotasana''' ({{lang-sa|कपोतासन}}; [[IAST]]: ''Kapotāsana'') or '''Pigeon Pose'''&lt;ref name=flow&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/asana-vinyasa-series/intermediate-series-nadi-shodhana/item/kapotasana-a/ | title = Kapotasana A - AshtangaYoga.info | accessdate = 2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[asana]].

== Etymology ==

The name comes from the Sanskrit words ''kapota'' (कपोत) meaning "pigeon"&lt;ref name=flow/&gt; and ''asana'' (आसन) meaning "posture" or "seat".&lt;ref name="Sinha1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinha|first=S.C.|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zzRvh1fRzEC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=1 June 1996|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD.|isbn=978-81-7041-293-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
A pose from the [[Ashtanga vinyasa yoga|Ashtanga]] tradition is an advanced asana which resembles [[Chakrasana]], or Wheel Pose. The shins and forearms are on the ground, the front body stretched upwards in the air. The pose is reached by going into a backbend with knees on the ground. It requires flexibility to bring the head back until it reaches the ground. Kapotasana is an asana which helps to open up the chest and also strengthens the back and groin. It opens and increases the flexibility of the hips&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.women.com/laurawagner/lists/how-to-pop-hip|title=How To Pop Your Hip Or Crack Your Hip|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, at the same time strengthening the back, and stretching the thighs and the groin.
There is another pose sometimes referred to as pigeon pose, but is actually properly referred to as King Pigeon or [[Rajakapotasana]] They are two very different poses, and King Pigeon has different variations as well. One bent leg is out front, with the shin perpendicular, parallel to the front of the mat. The other leg is stretched out straight behind. The body is held upright and the back foot may be held in a hand, or in the crook of the elbow. The chest may also be folded over the front leg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1136">'''Kıdaai Maqsin''' ('''Kudai Bakhsi''') or '''Kudaai Bakhsilaan''' is a fire-[[demon]] in [[Yakuts|Yakut]] mythology.  He was the first [[blacksmith]] and the originator of ironworking.  He lives in an iron house surrounded by flames. 

K'daai is said to possess curative powers.  In Yukut epics he heals the broken bones of heroes and tempers the souls of [[shaman]]s.

[[Chyky]], another famous Yakut smith, is not the same as K'daai.  Chyky not only makes excellent weapons, but gives wise advice as well.

{{Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], ''kulakara'' (also ''manu'') refers to the wise men who teach people how to perform the laborious activities for survival.{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=36-37}} According to [[Jain Cosmology]], when the third ara of the ''avasarpani'' (present descending half-cycle of cosmic age) was nearing its end, felicities due to ten type of ''[[Kalpavriksha]]'' (wish-fulfilling trees) started declining.{{sfn|Jain|2015|p=7-8}} The number of the sages who thus appeared is said to be fourteen, the last of whom was ''[[Nabhi|Nabhirai]]'', the father of the first ''[[tirthankara]]'', ''[[Rishabhanatha]]''.

==Overview==
[[Jainism]] acknowledge a set of first law-givers who flourished in the present ''Avasarpini'' age (in the third division called ''susama-duhsama'', when beings were born as twins and when the ''[[Kalpavriksha]]'' (wishing trees) used to provide them with necessary food, light and other necessities of life). The age of ''Kulakara'' was a primitive one, when arts and sciences were not known, and crime and punishment were in infancy.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=69}}

==Fourteen Kulakaras ==
[[File:Parents of Tirthankara.jpg|thumb|Image depicting the last ''kulakara'', Nabhirai and his wife ''[[Marudevi]]'']]

=== Pratisruti ===
The first ''kulakara'' was Pratisruti. When the trees that shed strong light around them, in the state of the ''bhogabhumi'' disappeared and the sun and the moon became visible, the people, who saw them for the first time, were alarmed. It was Pratisruti who understood the cause of their appearance by his superior wisdom. He explained to them that the light of the trees had been too powerful thus far to enable the sun and the moon to be seen but now that that illumination had paled they became visible. The division of day and night dates from his time.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929|p=51}}

=== Sanmati ===
Sanmati was the second ''kulakara''. In his time the light of the trees had faded into insignificance, and even the stars became visible in the sky.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929|p=52}}

=== Kshemankara ===
Then came Kshemankara, after the lapse of a long long time. In his time animals began to be troublesome. Hitherto the feeding-trees had supplied men and animals with enough food; but now the conditions were changing, and every one had to look for himself. The distinction of domestic and wild animals dates from Kshemankara’s time.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929|p=53}}

Kshemandhara was the fourth manu who followed Kshemankara after a long interval of time. He is said to have devised weapons of wood and stone to drive away wild animals.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929|p=53}}

=== Seemankara ===
The next manu was ''Seemankara''. In his time, quarrels arose over the ''kalpa trees'' (wish-fulfilling trees).{{sfn|Lal|1991|p=14}} He was called ''Seemankara'', because he had fixed the ''seemas'' (boundaries) of proprietorship. 

=== Seemandhara ===
Seemandhara was the next in order to appear. The quarrels had become more intense by his time over the disappearing kal'pa vrikshas (trees). He laid the foundation of individual ownership over the trees, and he also set marks on them.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929|p=53}}

=== Vimalabahana ===
Vimalabahana was the seventh manu. He taught men how to utilise the services of domestic animals, and invented the tethering rope, the bridle and the like to keep them under control.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929|p=53}}

=== Chakshusmana ===
Chakshusmana then appeared after the lapse of another long period of time. In his time the old order of bhogabhumi was so far changed that the parents did not die at the birth of their progeny. Some people were astonished at this and enquired the cause of the change from Chakshusmana, which he explained.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929|p=53-54}}

=== Yasasvana ===
Yasasvana, the ninth ''kulakara''. According to [[Jain texts]], he taught the men how to regard their children as their own, and to bless them.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929|p=54}}

=== Abhi Chandra ===
The tenth manu was Abhi Chandra, in whose time the old order of things underwent still further changes. The people now lived to play with their children; they also began to give them useful instruction. Because Abhi Chandra was the first to play with his children in moonlight he came to be known as Abhi Chandra (chandra signifying the moon).{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929|p=54}}

=== Chandrabha ===
The eleventh manu was Chandrabha, in whose time children came to be looked after better. His guidance was also very beneficial 
for mankind in certain other ways.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929|p=54}}

=== Marud deva ===
The twelfth manu was Marud Deva. He is said to have taught the art of navigation.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929|p=54}}

=== Prasenajit ===
Prasenajit was the thirteen ''kulakara''. According to Jain texts, in his time children came to be born with ''prasena'' (the amnion or membrane in which a child is born).{{sfn|Lal|1991|p=15}} Before his time children were not wrapped in a membrane.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929|p=55}}

=== Nabhi rai ===
{{main|Nabhi}}
The last of the ''kulakaras'' was Nabhi Rai. He was the father of [[Rishabhanatha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PMTWAAAAMAAJ|title=Jain Journal|year=1999|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kulkara'' Nabhi taught the men how to cut the navel chord (''nabhi''). According to Jain texts, thick rain cloud began to gather in the sky freely in his time.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929|p=55}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3985">The '''Letter of Tansar'''&lt;!-- no standard pronunciation; the original pronunciation of 'T?n(s|sh)?r' (Tansar, Tonsar, Tunshar etc) is not reconstructible --&gt; ({{lang-fa|نامه تنسر}}) was a 6th-century [[Sassanid]] propaganda instrument that portrayed the preceding [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid period]] as morally corrupt and heretical (to [[Zoroastrianism]]), and presented the first Sassanid dynast [[Ardashir I]] as having "restored" the faith to a "firm foundation." The letter was simultaneously a declaration of the unity of Zoroastrian church and [[Iran (word)|Iranian]] state, "for church and state were born of the one womb, joined together and never to be sundered."{{sfn|Boyce|1968|p=12}}

The document seems to have been based on a genuine 3rd-century letter written by Tansar, the Zoroastrian high priest under Ardashir I, to a certain Gushnasp of [[Tabaristan|Parishwar/Tabaristan]], one of vassal kings of the Arsacid [[Artabanus IV of Parthia|Ardavan IV]]. This original missive was apparently written not long after Ardashir had overthrown Ardavan, and Tansar appears to have been responding to charges levelled at Ardashir, and the delay in accepting Ardashir's suzerainty.{{sfn|Boyce|1968|p=5}} Representative of those charges is the accusation that Ardashir "had taken away fires from the fire-temples, extinguished them and blotted them out." To this, Tansar replies that it was the "kings of the peoples [i.e. Parthians' vassal kings]" that began the practice of dynastic fires, an "innovation" unauthorized by the kings of old.{{sfn|Boyce|1968|pp=26, 47}} A similar response appears in Book IV of the 9th century ''[[Denkard]]''.{{sfn|Adhami|2003|p=226f}}

The letter was revised in the 6th-century, during the reign of [[Khosrau I|Khusrow I Anoshiravan]].&lt;!--Boyce 1984:109 --&gt; The legend that the Arsacid Parthians had allowed Zoroastrianism to fall into neglect stems from the same period.{{sfn|Boyce|1984|p=109}} The letter was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the 9th century by [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa|Ibn al-Muqaffa]], and from Arabic into [[New Persian]] in the 13th-century when Ibn Isfandiar, an Iranian Muslim, put it in his ''History of Tabaristan'' (a mountainous region in northern [[Greater Iran|Iran]]). The Ibn Isfandiar version, which dates to 1210-1216, is the only one that survives. 

The importance of the Letter of Tansar was first perceived by James Darmesteter, who published the first critical translation of it in 1894.{{sfn|Darmesteter|1884|pp=185–250}}.

'''Nissim Elias Benjamin Ezra''' (1883–1936),{{sfn|Cesarani|2014|p=186}} commonly known as '''N.E.B. Ezra''', was a [[Baghdadi Jewish]] publisher and [[Zionist]] based in [[Shanghai]]. He founded the Shanghai Zionist Association in 1903 and its official newspaper, ''[[Israel's Messenger]]'', one of China's oldest and most sophisticated Jewish periodicals. He served as editor-in-chief of the newspaper for more than 30 years until his death in 1936. Influenced by Ezra, his nephews started the newspaper ''Jewish Tribune'' in [[Bombay]], India.

==Biography==
[[File:Israel's Messenger first issue.jpg|thumb|First issue of ''[[Israel's Messenger]]'', 22 April 1904]]
[[File:Israel's Messenger 1929.jpg|thumb|[[Silver jubilee]] issue of ''Israel's Messenger'', 5 April 1929]]
Nissim Elias Benjamin Ezra was a [[Baghdadi Jew]]{{sfn|Goldstein|1998|p=152}} born in [[Lahore]], [[British India]] (now Pakistan),{{sfn|Messmer|2012|p=15}} and settled in [[Shanghai]], China. An ardent [[Zionist]],{{sfn|Goldstein|1998|p=152}} he established the Shanghai Zionist Association (SZA) in 1903 and its official newspaper, ''[[Israel's Messenger]]'', in 1904. The newspaper was one of China's oldest Jewish periodicals, and became one of the most sophisticated under Ezra's leadership.{{sfn|Ristaino|2003|p=131}} He served as Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper for more than 30 years until his death in 1936.{{sfn|Goldstein|1998|p=151}} It was also circulated in the United States, where it successfully positioned itself as the most authoritative Jewish voice in East Asia.{{sfn|Bei Gao|2013|p=90}}

Ezra also served as the main leader of the Shanghai Zionist Association, which had about 100 members in March 1905, for many years.{{sfn|Goldstein|1998|p=252}} A major financial supporter of the movement was the tycoon [[Elly Kadoorie]],{{sfn|Goldstein|1998|p=251}} who became chairman of the SZA in 1915.{{sfn|Goldstein|1998|p=253}} Despite their efforts, Zionism did not become a major cause of the wealthy Baghdadi Jews of Shanghai, who were organized as the Shanghai Jewish Community Association.{{sfn|Cesarani|2014|p=186}} On the other hand, Ezra received support from [[Sun Yat-sen]], leader of China's nationalist revolution. In a letter to Ezra dated 24 April 1920, Sun wrote that "all lovers of Democracy cannot help but support wholeheartedly and welcome with enthusiasm the movement to restore your wonderful and historic nation, which has contributed so much to the civilization of the world and which rightfully deserves an honorable place in the family of nations."{{sfn|Bei Gao|2013|p=14}}

On 5 December 1936, Ezra died of heart disease in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/1936/12/07/archive/n-e-b-ezra-editor-of-israels-messenger-dies-in-shanghai|title=N.e.b.

==Views==
N.E.B. Ezra held a pessimistic view of the West, at a time when Europe was dominated by the regimes in Germany and Russia, which were responsible for widespread human rights abuses. He saw the East a refuge of humanity, and pleaded for a new [[Buddha]], who, like [[Moses]], [[Confucius]], [[Jesus]], and [[Mohammed]], would save the world from the threat of tyranny.{{sfn|Messmer|2012|p=15}} That view made him controversial among the Sephardi Jewish community.{{sfn|Messmer|2012|p=15}}

Ezra extolled the contributions made by the Jews to the development and modernization of China, and thought following the teachings of Confucius would save China and move the world: "Confucius pleaded for justice and righteousness; he made morality and good government synonymous. If the country is willing to follow him and adopt his teachings then China will be able to 'move the world' in the real sense of the word."{{sfn|Messmer|2012|p=15}} The view was seen as overly idealistic for the time, when China was faced with grave threats from [[Japanese imperialism]].{{sfn|Messmer|2012|p=15}}

On 15 September 1933, Ezra wrote a letter to [[Mamoru Shigemitsu]] and proposed to resettle the European Jews persecuted by [[Nazi Germany]] in [[Manchukuo]]. He also wrote to [[Israel Cohen (Zionist)|Israel Cohen]], secretary of the [[World Zionist Organization]] in London, for support. Cohen opposed his plan, noting that it would be inappropriate to settle the refugees in Japanese-occupied Manchukuo, and the potential instability that might result from the conflict between Japan and the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Manchuria]].{{sfn|Bei Gao|2013|p=95}}

==Legacy==
Ezra's nephews, the Sargon brothers (Benjamin, Joseph, and David) of [[Bombay]], grew up reading ''Israel's Messenger''. Greatly influenced by Ezra's journalistic concepts, the brothers edited the ''Jewish Advocate'' (later renamed the ''Jewish Tribune'') in the 1930s, bringing it to a much higher level of professionalism than the older Jewish newspapers of Bombay.{{sfn|Goldstein|1998|p=151}}

      <comment>"Cush" here is a biblical figure. We do not know if his name is related to the ancient kingdom of Kush and, even if it is, we should not identify Kush with modern-day Ethiopia, since it was located more in present-day Sudan. Nimrod's name does not mean "Ethiopian" either. Also, it is debated whether or not "Shinar" necessarily refers to Sumer or to merely the geographic region of Mesopotamia as a whole.</comment>

'''Nimrod''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɪ|m|r|ɒ|d}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng |work = LDS.org |title = Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide |access-date = 25 February 2012}} [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «nĭm´räd»&lt;/ref&gt; {{Hebrew Name|נִמְרוֹדֿ|Nīmrōd|Nīmrōḏ}}, {{lang-arc|ܢܡܪܘܕ}}, {{lang-ar|النمرود}} ''an-Namrūd''), a biblical figure described as a king in the land of [[Shinar]] ([[Assyria]]/[[Mesopotamia]]), was, according to the [[Book of Genesis]] and [[Books of Chronicles]], the son of [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]], therefore the great-grandson of [[Noah]]. The [[Bible]] states that he was "a mighty hunter before the Lord [and] .... began to be mighty in the earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=nimrod&amp;qs_version=GNV |title = BibleGateway |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extra-biblical traditions associating him with the [[Tower of Babel]] led to his reputation as a king who was rebellious against God.

Attempts to match Nimrod with historically attested figures have failed. Nimrod may not represent any one personage known to history, and in reality is more likely a conflation of several real and fictional figures of Mesopotamian antiquity, including the Mesopotamian god [[Ninurta]],  the Akkadian kings [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] and his grandson [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] (2254–2218 BCE), and [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1243–1207 BC) of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]].

==Biblical account==
The first biblical mention of Nimrod is in the [[Table of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://yektauzunoglu.com/en/2017/02/04/zilhan-nimrods-daughter/|title=Zilhan, Nimrod's Daughter|work=Yekta Uzunoglu|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; He is described as the son of [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]], grandson of [[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]], and great-grandson of [[Noah]]; and as "a mighty one in the earth" and "a mighty hunter before the Lord". This is repeated in the [[Books of Chronicles|First Book of Chronicles]] 1:10, and the "Land of Nimrod" used as a synonym for Assyria or Mesopotamia, is mentioned in the [[Book of Micah]] 5:6:

{{quote|And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the'' land of Nimrod ''in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.}}

Genesis says that the "beginning of his kingdom" (''reshit mamlakto'') were the towns of "[[Babylon|Babel]], [[Erech]], [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]] and [[Calneh]] in the land of [[Shinar]]" ([[Mesopotamia]]) (Gen 10:10)—understood variously to imply that he either founded these cities, ruled over them, or both. Owing to an ambiguity in the original [[Hebrew]] text, it is unclear whether it is he or [[Ashur]] who additionally built [[Nineveh]], [[Resen (Genesis)|Resen]], [[Rehoboth-Ir]] and [[Calah]] (both interpretations are reflected in various [[English language|English]] versions). [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] devoted several pages in his ''History of the World'' (c. 1616) to reciting past scholarship regarding the question of whether it had been Nimrod or Ashur who built the cities in Assyria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Raleigh |first = Walter |title = History of the World |location =  |publisher =  |pages = 358–365 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions and legends==

In [[Hebrew Bible stories|Hebrew]] and [[Christian]] tradition, Nimrod is considered the leader of those who built the Tower of Babel in the land of [[Shinar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Menner |first = Robert J. |year = 1938 |title = Nimrod and the Wolf in the Old English 'Solomon and Saturn' |magazine = [[Journal of English and Germanic Philology]] |volume = 37 |issue = 3 |pages = 332–84 |jstor = 27704407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the Bible never actually states this. Nimrod's kingdom included the cities of Babel, Erech, Akkad, and perhaps [[Calneh]], in Shinar (Ge 10:10).&lt;ref&gt;Depending on how the text is read, "Calneh" may be the fourth city name in this enumeration, or it may be part of an expression meaning "all of them in Shinar". {{harv|Van der Toorn|Van der Horst|1990|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flavius Josephus]] believed that it was likely under his direction that the building of Babel and its tower began; in addition to Josephus, this is also the view found in the [[Talmud]] (''[[Chullin]]'' 89a, ''[[Pesahim]]'' 94b, ''[[Erubin]]'' 53a, ''[[Avodah Zarah]]'' 53b), and later ''[[midrash]]'' such as ''[[Genesis Rabba]]''. Several of these early Judaic sources also assert that the king [[Amraphel]], who wars with Abraham later in Genesis, is none other than Nimrod himself.

Since Accad (Babylonian [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]) was destroyed and lost with the destruction of its Empire in the period 2200–2154 BCE ([[long chronology]]), the stories mentioning Nimrod seem to recall the late [[Early Bronze Age]]. The association with Erech (Babylonian [[Uruk]]), a city that lost its prime importance around 2,000 BCE as a result of struggles between [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Elam]], also attests the early provenance of the stories of Nimrod. According to some modern-day theorists, their placement in the Bible suggests a Babylonian origin—possibly inserted during the [[Babylonian captivity]].&lt;ref name=vans /&gt;

Judaic interpreters as early as [[Philo]] and [[Yochanan ben Zakai]] (1st century AD) interpreted "a mighty hunter ''before'' the Lord" (Heb.: גבר ציד לפני יהוה, ''ḡibbōr-ṣayiḏ lip̄nê Yahweh'', lit. "in the face of [[Yahweh]]") as signifying "''in opposition to'' the Lord"; a similar interpretation is found in [[Pseudo-Philo]], as well as later in [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]]. Some rabbinic commentators have also connected the name ''Nimrod'' with a Hebrew word meaning 'rebel'. In Pseudo-Philo (dated ca. AD 70), Nimrod is made leader of the Hamites, while [[Joktan]] as leader of the Semites, and Fenech as leader of the Japhethites, are also associated with the building of the Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = James |last = Kugel |title = Traditions of the Bible |year = 1998 |location =  |publisher =  |page = 230 |isbn =  |oclc = }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Versions of this story are again picked up in later works such as ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'' (7th century AD).

The [[Book of Jubilees]] mentions the name of "Nebrod" (the Greek form of Nimrod) only as being the father of [[Azurad]], the wife of [[Eber]] and mother of [[Peleg]] (8:7). This account would thus make Nimrod an ancestor of Abraham, and hence of all Hebrews.

Josephus wrote:
[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|''Nimrod'' by [[Yitzhak Danziger]]]]
{{quote|Now it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and contempt of God. He was the grandson of Ham, the son of Noah, a bold man, and of great strength of hand. He persuaded them not to ascribe it to God, as if it were through his means they were happy, but to believe that it was their own courage which procured that happiness. He also gradually changed the government into tyranny, seeing no other way of turning men from the fear of God, but to bring them into a constant dependence on his power. He also said he would be revenged on God, if he should have a mind to drown the world again; for that he would build a tower too high for the waters to reach. And that he would avenge himself on God for destroying their forefathers.

Now the multitude were very ready to follow the determination of Nimrod, and to esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God; and they built a tower, neither sparing any pains, nor being in any degree negligent about the work: and, by reason of the multitude of hands employed in it, it grew very high, sooner than any one could expect; but the thickness of it was so great, and it was so strongly built, that thereby its great height seemed, upon the view, to be less than it really was. It was built of burnt brick, cemented together with mortar, made of bitumen, that it might not be liable to admit water. When God saw that they acted so madly, he did not resolve to destroy them utterly, since they were not grown wiser by the destruction of the former sinners; but he caused a tumult among them, by producing in them diverse languages, and causing that, through the multitude of those languages, they should not be able to understand one another. The place wherein they built the tower is now called Babylon, because of the confusion of that language which they readily understood before; for the Hebrews mean by the word Babel, confusion ...}}

An early [[Arabic]] work known as ''Kitab al-Magall'' or the ''Book of Rolls'' (part of [[Clementine literature]]) states that Nimrod built the towns of Hadāniūn, [[Ellasar]], [[Seleucia]], [[Ctesiphon]], Rūhīn, [[Atrapatene]], Telalān, and others, that he began his reign as king over earth when [[Reu]] was 163, and that he reigned for 69 years, building [[Nisibis]], Raha ([[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]) and [[Harran]] when [[Peleg]] was 50. It further adds that Nimrod "saw in the sky a piece of black cloth and a crown." He called upon Sasan the weaver and commanded him to make him a crown like it, which he set jewels on and wore. He was allegedly the first king to wear a crown. "For this reason people who knew nothing about it, said that a crown came down to him from [[heaven]]." Later, the book describes how Nimrod established fire worship and idolatry, then received instruction in divination for three years from Bouniter, the [[fourth son of Noah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/aa/aa2.htm |title = the ''Kitab al-Magall'' |publisher = Sacred-texts.com |date =  |accessdate = 5 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Recognitions'' (R 4.29), one version of the Clementines, Nimrod is equated with the legendary Assyrian king [[Ninus]], who first appears in the [[Greek people|Greek]] historian [[Ctesias]] as the founder of Nineveh. However, in another version, the ''Homilies'' (H 9:4–6), Nimrod is made to be the same as [[Zoroaster]].

The [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''[[Cave of Treasures]]'' (ca. 350) contains an account of Nimrod very similar to that in the ''Kitab al-Magall'', except that Nisibis, Edessa and Harran are said to be built by Nimrod when Reu was 50, and that he began his reign as the first king when Reu was 130. In this version, the weaver is called ''Sisan'', and the fourth son of Noah is called ''Yonton''.

[[Jerome]], writing ca. 390, explains in ''Hebrew Questions on Genesis'' that after Nimrod reigned in Babel, "he also reigned in Arach [Erech], that is, in Edissa; and in Achad [Accad], which is now called Nisibis; and in Chalanne [Calneh], which was later called Seleucia after King Seleucus when its name had been changed, and which is now in actual fact called Ctesiphon." However, this traditional identification of the cities built by Nimrod in Genesis is no longer accepted by modern scholars, who consider them to be located in [[Sumer]], not [[Syria]].

The [[Ge'ez]] ''[[Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan]]'' (ca. 5th century) also contains a version similar to that in the ''Cave of Treasures'', but the crown maker is called ''Santal'', and the name of Noah's fourth son who instructs Nimrod is ''Barvin''.

However, [[Ephrem the Syrian]] (306–373) relates a contradictory view, that Nimrod was righteous and opposed the builders of the Tower. Similarly, ''[[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]]'' (date uncertain) mentions a Jewish tradition that Nimrod left Shinar in southern Mesopotamia and fled to Assyria in northern Mesopotamia, because he refused to take part in building the Tower—for which God rewarded him with the four cities in Assyria, to substitute for the ones in Babel.

''[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]]'' (c. 833) relates the Jewish traditions that Nimrod inherited the garments of Adam and Eve from his father Cush, and that these made him invincible. Nimrod's party then defeated the Japhethites to assume universal rulership. Later, [[Esau]] (grandson of [[Abraham]]), ambushed, beheaded, and robbed Nimrod. These stories later reappear in other sources including the 16th century ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]'', which adds that Nimrod had a son named ''Mardon'' who was even more wicked.&lt;ref&gt;See Louis Ginsberg ''Legends of the Jews'' Vol I, and the footnotes volume.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings (book)|History of the Prophets and Kings]]'' by the 9th century [[Muslim]] historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], Nimrod has the tower built in Babil, [[Allah]] destroys it, and the language of mankind, formerly [[Syriac language|Syriac]], is then confused into 72 languages. Another Muslim historian of the 13th century, [[Abu al-Fida]], relates the same story, adding that the patriarch [[Eber]] (an ancestor of Abraham) was allowed to keep the original tongue, Hebrew in this case, because he would not partake in the building. The 10th-century Muslim historian [[Masudi]] recounts a legend making the Nimrod who built the tower to be the son of Mash, the son of [[Aram, son of Shem]], adding that he reigned 500 years over the [[Nabateans]]. Later, Masudi lists Nimrod as the first king of Babylon, and states that he dug great canals and reigned 60 years. Still elsewhere, he mentions another king Nimrod, son of [[Canaan (biblical figure)|Canaan]], as the one who introduced astrology and attempted to kill Abraham.

In [[Armenia]]n legend, the ancestor of the Armenian people, [[Hayk]], defeated Nimrod (sometimes equated with [[Bel (god)|Bel]]) in a battle near Lake Van.

In the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] legend of the Enchanted Stag (more commonly known as the White Stag [''Fehér Szarvas''] or Silver Stag), King Nimród (aka ''Ménrót'' and often described as "Nimród the Giant" or "the giant Nimród", descendant of one of Noah's "most wicked" sons, Kam (references abound in traditions, legends, several religions and historical sources to persons and nations bearing the name of Kam or Kám, and overwhelmingly, the connotations are negative), is the first person referred to as forefather of the Hungarians. He, along with his entire nation, is also the giant responsible for the building of the Tower of Babel—construction of which was supposedly started by him 201 years after the event of the Great Flood (see biblical story of [[Noah's Ark]]). After the catastrophic failure (through God's will) of that most ambitious endeavour and in the midst of the ensuing linguistic cacophony, Nimród the giant moved to the land of ''Evilát'', where his wife, ''Enéh'' gave birth to twin brothers ''Hunor'' and ''Magyar'' (aka ''Magor''). Father and sons were, all three of them, prodigious hunters, but Nimród especially is the archetypal, consummate, legendary hunter and archer. Both the Huns' and Magyars' historically attested skill with the recurve bow and arrow are attributed to Nimród. ([[Simon of Kéza|Simon Kézai]], personal "court priest" of King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus the Cuman]], in his ''Gesta Hungarorum'', 1282-85. This tradition can also be found in over twenty other medieval Hungarian chronicles, as well as a German one, according to Dr Antal Endrey in an article published in 1979&lt;!--http://arpad.org/pages.php?&amp;menuid=21--&gt;).

The twin sons of King Nimród, [[Hunor and Magor]], each with 100 warriors, followed the White Stag through the Meotis Marsh, where they lost sight of the magnificent animal. Hunor and Magor found the two daughters of King Dul of the Alans, together with their handmaidens, whom they kidnapped. Hungarian legends held Hunor and Magyar (aka Magor) to be ancestors of the [[Huns]] and the [[Magyars]] (Hungarians), respectively. According to the [[Miholjanec#Legend|Miholjanec legend]], [[Stephen V of Hungary]] had in front of his tent a golden plate with the inscription: "[[Attila]], the son of Bendeuci, grandson of the great Nimrod, born at [[Ein Gedi|Engedi]]: By the Grace of God King of the Huns, Medes, Goths, Dacians, the horrors of the world and the scourge of God."

Nimrod figures in some very early versions of the history of [[Freemasonry]], where he was said to have been one of the fraternity's founders. According to the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry: The legend of the Craft in the Old Constitutions refers to Nimrod as one of the founders of Masonry. Thus in the York MS., No. 1, we read: "At ye making of ye toure of Babell there was a Masonrie first much esteemed of, and the King of Babilon yt called Nimrod was a Mason himself and loved well Masons." However, he does not figure in the current rituals.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The demon [[Nyyrikki]], figuring in the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]'' as a helper of [[Lemminkäinen]], is associated with Nimrod by some researchers and linguists.&lt;ref&gt;''Kalevala''.

[[File:Abraham ready to sacrifice his son, Ishmael (top); Abraham cast into fire by Nimrod (bottom).jpg|thumb|upright|Abraham sacrificing his son, [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]]. [[Abraham]] cast into fire by Nimrod. From Zubdat-al Tawarikh, a 1583 Turkish manuscript.]]
A confrontation between Nimrod and [[Abraham]] is said to have taken place, according to several Jewish and Islamic traditions. Some stories bring them both together in a cataclysmic collision, seen as a symbol of the confrontation between Good and Evil, and/or as a symbol of [[monotheism]] against [[polytheism]]. On the other hand, some Jewish traditions say only that the two men met and had a discussion.{{ref}}

According to K. van der Toorn and P. W. van der Horst, this tradition is first attested in the writings of [[Pseudo-Philo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Van der Toorn|Van der Horst|1990|p= 19|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is also found in the [[Talmud]], and in rabbinical writings in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Daat enc|he-title=נמרוד|id1=1058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some versions (as in [[Flavius Josephus]]), Nimrod is a man who sets his will against that of God. In others, he proclaims himself a god and is worshipped as such by his subjects, sometimes with his consort [[Semiramis]] worshipped as a goddess at his side. (See also [[Ninus]].)

A portent in the stars tells Nimrod and his astrologers of the impending birth of Abraham, who would put an end to [[idolatry]]. Nimrod therefore orders the killing of all newborn babies. However, Abraham's mother escapes into the fields and gives birth secretly. At a young age, Abraham recognizes God and starts worshipping Him. He confronts Nimrod and tells him face-to-face to [[Abraham and the Idol Shop|cease his idolatry]], whereupon Nimrod orders him burned at the stake. In some versions, Nimrod has his subjects gather wood for four whole years, so as to burn Abraham in the biggest bonfire the world had ever seen. Yet when the fire is lit, Abraham walks out unscathed.

In some versions, Nimrod then challenges Abraham to battle. When Nimrod appears at the head of enormous armies, Abraham produces an army of [[gnat]]s which destroys Nimrod's army. Some accounts have a gnat or mosquito enter Nimrod's brain and drive him out of his mind (a divine retribution which Jewish tradition also assigned to the Roman Emperor [[Titus]], destroyer of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]).

In some versions, Nimrod repents and accepts God, offering numerous sacrifices that God rejects (as with [[Cain]]). Other versions have Nimrod give to Abraham, as a conciliatory gift, the giant slave [[Eliezer]], whom some accounts describe as Nimrod's own son. (The Bible also mentions Eliezer as Abraham's majordomo, though not making any connection between him and Nimrod.)

Still other versions have Nimrod persisting in his rebellion against God, or resuming it. Indeed, Abraham's crucial act of leaving [[Mesopotamia]] and settling in [[Canaan]] is sometimes interpreted as an escape from Nimrod's revenge. Accounts considered canonical place the building of the Tower many generations before Abraham's birth (as in the Bible, also ''[[Jubilees]]''); however in others, it is a later rebellion after Nimrod failed in his confrontation with Abraham. In still other versions, Nimrod does not give up after the Tower fails, but goes on to try storming Heaven in person, in a chariot driven by birds.

The story attributes to Abraham elements from the story of [[Moses]]' birth (the cruel king killing innocent babies, with the midwives ordered to kill them) and from the careers of [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] who emerged unscathed from the fire. Nimrod is thus given attributes of two archetypal cruel and persecuting kings – [[Nebuchadnezzar]] and [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Pharaoh]]. Some Jewish traditions also identified him with [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], whose birth according to [[Herodotus]] was accompanied by portents, which made his grandfather try to kill him.

A confrontation is also found in the [[Qur'an]], between a king, not mentioned by name, and the Prophet [[Abraham|Ibrahim]] (Arabic for "Abraham"). Muslim commentators assign Nimrod as the king. In Ibrahim's confrontation with the king, the former argues that Allah (God) is the one who gives life and gives death. The king responds by bringing out two people sentenced to death. He releases one and kills the other, as a poor attempt at making a point that he also brings life and death. Ibrahim refutes him by stating that Allah brings the Sun up from the East, and so he asks the king to bring it from the West. The king is then perplexed and angered.

Whether or not conceived as having ultimately repented, Nimrod remained in Jewish and Islamic tradition an emblematic evil person, an archetype of an idolater and a tyrannical king. In rabbinical writings up to the present, he is almost invariably referred to as "Nimrod the Evil" ({{lang-he|נמרוד הרשע}}).

Nimrod is mentioned by name in several places in the Baha'i scriptures, including the [[Kitáb-i-Íqán]], the primary theological work of the [[Bahá'í Faith|Baha'i religion]]. There it is said that Nimrod "dreamed a dream" which his soothsayers interpreted as signifying the birth of a new star in heaven. A herald is then said to have appeared in the land announcing "the coming of Abraham."&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KI/ki-2.html "The Kitáb-i-Íqán"] ''Baha'i Reference Library''. pp 41–80. Retrieved 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Nimrod is also mentioned in one of the earliest writings of the [[Báb]] (the herald of the Baha'i Faith).  Citing examples of God's power, he asks:  "Has He not, in past days, caused Abraham, in spite of His seeming helplessness, to triumph over the forces of Nimrod?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Effendi |first1 = Shoghi |title = The Dawn-Breakers |url = http://bahai-library.com/books/dawnbreakers/chapters/3.html#94 |website = bahai-library.com |publisher = Baha'i Publishing Trust |accessdate = 23 February 2016 |page = 94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Abraham's confrontation with Nimrod did not remain within the confines of learned writings and religious treatises, but also conspicuously influenced popular culture. A notable example is "''[[Quando el Rey Nimrod]]''" ("When King Nimrod"), one of the most well-known folksongs in [[Ladino language|Ladino]] (the Judeo-Spanish language), apparently written during the reign of King [[Alfonso X]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. Beginning with the words: "When King Nimrod went out to the fields/ Looked at the heavens and at the stars/He saw a holy light in the Jewish quarter/A sign that Abraham, our father, was about to be born", the song gives a poetic account of the persecutions perpetrated by the cruel Nimrod and the miraculous birth and deeds of the savior Abraham. (Full original text and an English translation appear in the Ladino Wikipedia article.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hebrewsongs.com/song-hamelechnimrod.htm |title = CUANDO ELREY NIMROD |work = hebrewsongs.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://zemerl.com/cgi-bin//show.pl?title=Cuando+El+Rey+Nimrod+(When+King+Nimrod) |title = Cuando El Rey Nimrod |trans-title = When King Nimrod |work = zemerl.com |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090106094702/http://zemerl.com/cgi-bin/show.pl?title=Cuando+El+Rey+Nimrod+(When+King+Nimrod) |archivedate = 6 January 2009 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.last.fm/music/Tim+Rayborn/_/Cuando+El+Rey+Nimrod |title = Tim Rayborn: Cuando El Rey Nimrod |work = Last.fm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic narrative===
According to the Islamic narrative, Abraham seems to have a series of discussions with Nimrod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = The Story of Abraham (part 4 of 7): His Migration to Canaan |work= The Religion of Islam |url = http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/294/story-of-abraham-part-4/#_ftnref26516 |accessdate = 16 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quran]] states, "Have you not considered him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord, because God had given him the kingdom (i.e. he was prideful)?"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |title = Surat Al-Baqarah [2:258] - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم |url = http://legacy.quran.com/2/258 |website = legacy.quran.com |accessdate = 16 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham says, "My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death."

According to [[Mujahid ibn Jabr|Mujahid]], "Four people gained control over the earth, east and west, two believers and two disbelievers. The two believers were [[Solomon]] and [[Dhul-Qarnayn|Dhul Qarnayn]], and the two disbelievers were [[Nebuchadnezzar I|Nebuchadnezzar]] and Nimrod. No one but they gained power over it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Reconciling between the verses "There is no compulsion in religion" [al-Baqarah 2:256] and "and we shall drive them out from there in disgrace, and they will be abased" [an-Naml 27:37] - islamqa.info |url = http://islamqa.info/en/178756 |website = islamqa.info |accessdate = 16 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Text of the Midrash Rabba version===
The following version of the confrontation between Abraham and Nimrod appears in the [[Midrash Rabba]], a major compilation of Jewish Scriptural [[exegesis]]. The part in which this appears, the [[Genesis Rabbah]] (Chapter 38, 13), is considered to date from the sixth century.

When Abraham went into the furnace and survived, Haran was asked: "Whose [follower] are you?" and he answered: "I am Abraham's!".

==Historical interpretations==
[[File:Naram-Sin inscription AO6782 stitched.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Inscription of Naram Sin found at the city of [[Marad]]]]

Historians, [[Orientalists]], [[Assyriologists]] and [[mythographers]] have long tried to find links between Nimrod and real historically attested figures in Mesopotamia.

Since the city of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]] was destroyed and lost with the destruction of its Empire in the period 2200–2154 BC ([[long chronology]]), the stories mentioning Nimrod seem to recall the late Early [[Bronze Age]]. The association with Erech ([[Sumero-Akkadian]] [[Uruk]]), a city that lost its prime importance around 2,000 BC as a result of struggles between [[Isin]], [[Ur]], [[Larsa]] and [[Elam]], also attests the early provenance of the stories of Nimrod.&lt;ref name=vans&gt;{{harvp|Van der Toorn|Van der Horst|1990|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Mesopotamian]] ruins were given Nimrod's name by 8th-century AD [[Arabs]], including the ruins of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] city of [[Kalhu]] (the biblical [[Calah]]), built by [[Shalmaneser I]] (1274–1244 BC)&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite book |author-link = Stephen L Harris |last = Harris |first = Stephen L. |title = Understanding the Bible |location = Palo Alto |publisher = Mayfield |year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of attempts to connect him with historical figures have been made.

The Christian Bishop [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] as early as the early 4th century, noting that the [[Babylonia]]n historian [[Berossus]] in the 3rd century BC had stated that the first king after the flood was ''Euechoios'' of Chaldea, identified him with Nimrod. [[George Syncellus]] (c. 800) also had access to Berossus, and he too identified ''Euechoios'' with the biblical Nimrod. More recently, Sumerologists have suggested additionally connecting both this ''Euechoios'', and the king of Babylon and grandfather of [[Gilgamesh|Gilgamos]] who appears in the oldest copies of [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] (c. 200 AD) as ''Euechoros'', with the name of the founder of Uruk known from cuneiform sources as [[Enmerkar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Henkelman |first = Wouter F. M. |chapter = The Birth of Gilgamesh |title = Altertum und Mittelmeerraum: die antike Welt diesseits und jenseits der Levante |location =  |publisher =  |page = 819 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, J.D. Prince also suggested a possible link between the Lord (Ni) of [[Marad]] and Nimrod. He mentioned how Dr. Kraeling was now inclined to connect Nimrod historically with Lugal-Banda, a mythological king mentioned in Poebel, Historical Texts, 1914, whose seat was at the city Marad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Prince |first = J.D. |year = 1920 |title = A Possible Sumerian Original of the Name Nimrod |journal = Journal of the American Oriental Society }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by Theodore Jacobson in 1989, writing on "Lugalbanda and Ninsuna".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Jacobsen |first = Theodor |year = 1989 |title = LUgalbanda and Ninsuna |magazine = Journal of Cuneiform Studies }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ronald Hendel]] the name Nimrod is probably a polemical distortion of the god [[Ninurta]], a prominent god in [[Mesopotamian religion]] who had cult centers in a number of [[Assyria]]n cities such as [[Kalhu]], and also in [[Babylon]], and was a patron god of a number of [[Assyria]]n kings.&lt;ref name="Metzger &amp; Coogan"&gt;{{cite book |title = Oxford Guide to the Bible |page = 557 |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1993 |isbn = 978-0-19-534095-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nimrod's imperial ventures described in ''Genesis'' may be based on the conquests of the [[Kings of Assyria|Assyrian king]] [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (Dalley et al., 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;67). [[Julian Jaynes]] also indicates Tukulti-Ninurta I (a powerful king of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]]) as the origin for Nimrod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3eQd-x-cxPwC&amp;lpg=PP1 |last = Jaynes |first = Julian |title = The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind |publisher = Mariner Books |year = 2000 |accessdate = 16 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Hislop]], in his tract ''[[The Two Babylons]]'' decided that Nimrod was to be identified with [[Ninus]] (also unattested in Mesopotamian king lists), who according to [[Greek mythology|Greek]] legend was a [[Mesopotamia]]n king and husband of [[Semiramis]], with a whole host of deities throughout the [[Mediterranean]] world, and with the Persian [[Zoroaster]]. The identification with [[Ninus]] follows that of the ''Clementine Recognitions''; the one with Zoroaster, that of the ''Clementine Homilies'', both works part of [[Clementine literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-08/anf08-53.htm |title = Homily IX |publisher = Ccel.org |date = 1 June 2005 |accessdate = 5 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a historical Assyrian queen [[Shammuramat]] in the 9th century, the wife of [[Shamshi-Adad V]], whom some speculations have identified with Semiramis, while others make her a later namesake of a much earlier Semiramis.

In [[David Rohl]]'s theory, [[Enmerkar]], the [[Sumer]]ian founder of [[Uruk]], was the original inspiration for Nimrod, because the story of ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]'' (see:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1823.htm |title = Enmerkar and the lord of Aratta: translation |publisher = Etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk |date =  |accessdate = 12 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) bears a few similarities to the legend of Nimrod and the Tower of Babel, and because the -KAR in Enmerkar means "hunter". Additionally, Enmerkar is said to have had ziggurats built in both Uruk and [[Eridu]], which Rohl postulates was the site of the original Babel.

[[George Rawlinson]] believed Nimrod was [[Belus (Babylonian)|Belus]] (like Nimrod and Ninus a king not attested in Mesopotamian annals, but claimed by the later Greeks to have been a king of Assyria) based on the fact Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions bear the names [[Bel-|Bel-{{sic|hide=y|Nibru}}]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Seven Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World |volume = Vol. 1 |pages = 347–350 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Nibru'' in the [[Akkadian language]] of Assyria and Babylonia comes from a root meaning to 'pursue' or to make 'one flee', and as Rawlinson pointed out not only does this closely resemble Nimrod’s name but it also perfectly fits the description of Nimrod in Genesis 10: 9 as a great hunter. The Belus-Nimrod equation or link is also found in many old works such as [[Moses of Chorene]] and the ''[[Book of the Bee]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mos. Choren. 1. 6; 9; ''Book of the Bee'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nibru]], in the [[Sumerian language]], was the original name of the city of [[Nippur]].

Joseph Poplicha wrote in 1929 about the identification of Nimrod in the first dynasty or Uruk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first = Joseph |last = Poplicha |jstor = 593008 |title = The Biblical Nimrod and the Kingdom of Eanna |journal = Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume = 49 |year = 1929 |pages = 303–317 |doi = 10.2307/593008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yigal Levin (2002) suggests that Nimrod was a recollection of Sargon of Akkad and of his grandson Naram-Sin, with the name "Nimrod" derived from the latter. He argues that:
{{quote|The biblical Nimrod, then, is not a total counterpart of any one historical character. He is rather the composite Hebrew equivalent of the Sargonid dynasty: the first, mighty king to rule after the flood. Later influence modified the legend in the Mesopotamian tradition, adding such details as the hero’s name, his territory and some of his deeds, and most important his title, “King of Kish”. The later editors of the Book of Genesis dropped much of the story and mistakenly identified the Mesopotamian Kish with the Hamitic Cush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first = Yigal |last = Levin |title = Nimrod the Mighty, King of Kish, King of Sumer and Akkad |magazine = Vetus Testamentum |volume = 52 |year = 2002 |pages = 350–356 |doi = 10.1163/156853302760197494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Literature==
* In the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]] (written 1308–21), Nimrod is portrayed as a [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] (which was common in the Medieval period). With the giants [[Aloadae|Ephialtes]], [[Antaeus]], [[Hekatonkheires|Briareus]], [[Tityos]], and [[Typhon]], he stands in chains on the outer edge of Hell's Circle of Treachery. His only line is "[[Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi]]", words whose unintelligibility emphasizes his guilt for the confusion of languages after the tower of Babel.&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Inferno'', XXXI.67 and 76.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[La Fin de Satan|The End of Satan]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]] (written 1854–1855), Nemrod is the sword symbol of war, attempting to reach the skies after having destroyed the earth. This unfinished text tries to compare biblical text and historical events, making out of the taking of the Bastille a nearly religious theme.
* In ''[[The Matlock Paper]]'' by [[Robert Ludlum]] (written 1973), the protagonist, James Barbour Matlock, an English professor in his 30s, is recruited by the Department of Justice to investigate a drug smuggling ring led by a mysterious figure named "Nimrod".
* In the Kate Daniels series by [[Ilona Andrews]] (written 2007–present), the protagonist, Kate Daniels, is the last daughter of an immortal who was originally known as Nimrod, builder of towers.
* In the film ''[[The Bible: In the Beginning...]]'' (1966), Nimrod is portrayed by the actor Stephen Boyd.

==Idiom==

In modern [[American English]], the term is often used sarcastically to mean a dimwitted or a stupid person, a usage first recorded in 1932 and popularized by the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon characters [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Daffy Duck]], who both sarcastically refer to the hunter [[Elmer Fudd]] as "nimrod",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Steinmetz |first = Sol |title = Dictionary of Jewish Usage: A Guide to the Use of Jewish Terms |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Nk_RFL9LYg0C&amp;pg=PA126 |accessdate = 11 April 2012 |year = 2005 |publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn = 978-0-7425-4387-4 |page = 126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Garner |first = Bryan A. |title = Garner's Modern American Usage |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mVcJqKs1isUC&amp;pg=PR53 |accessdate = 11 April 2012 |date = 27 August 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |isbn = 978-0-19-538275-4 |page = 53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as an ironic connection between "mighty hunter" and "poor little Nimrod", i.e. Fudd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Bauer |first = S.

He is regarded as a [[jester|buffoon]] and a [[charlatan]].  He is depicted as smiling.  He is of the inferior order, high upper gallery of hell.

== Similarity with Nebahaz ==
The name Nybbas has remarkable resemblance with "Nebahaz", one of several deities protecting the individual cities of Samaria who are mentioned specifically by name in the Bible, in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 17:31. In his "Encyclopédie Théologique", or "Dictionnaire ... de la Bible", [[Augustin Calmet]] asserts that Nebahaz and Nebachas are one and the same and associates them with Nebo, another name for the god [[Nabu]].

== In Nomine ==
In the [[In Nomine (role-playing game)|In Nomine]] RPG, Nybbas is the Demon Prince of Media.

== History ==

=== Polish Old Catholic Church ===
The Old Catholic Church in Poland is a continuation of the mission of the Polish Old Catholic Church, which was established in 1933 as a result of the split in the Polish diocese of the Polish Catholic Church.

The first bishop of the Polish Old Catholic Church was Wladyslaw Faron, who left the PNKK structure in 1931. In the interwar Poland, the Old Catholic Church operated as an informal union with the parish priest of Father Józef Kostorz from the Old Catholic Church in Germany. After World War II in Poland, the Old Catholic Church entered the ecclesial union with the Polish Old Catholic Churches: the Old Catholic Church of Mariavite and the mission diocese of the [[Polish National Catholic Church]]. However, in 1948 it broke up after Bishop Faron and a few priests joined the Roman Catholic Church. Bishop Zygmunt Szypold became the superior of the Polish Old Catholic Church. After his death, the authorities of the Polish People's Republic suspended the activities of the Church (1965), citing a lack of authority. The faithful of the Polish Old Catholic Church either went to other churches or practiced underground faith until the resumption of the official activity of the Church, made through the entry into the Register of Churches and Religious Unions in the Ministry of Interior and Administration by Fr. Bishop Wojciech Kolm in 1996. In Hamburg, despite the suspension of the Church's activity, father Klaudiusz Perendyk, who later joined the [[Orthodox Church]]. The consequence of the suspension of the activities of the Old Catholic Church was very acute, because the Church lost many sacred objects, which were often illegally acquired by the Catholic Church and [[Roman Catholic Church]].

'''Richard Cevantis Carrier''' (born December 1, 1969) is an American historian, atheist activist, author, public speaker and blogger.

Carrier has a doctorate in ancient history from [[Columbia University]] where his thesis was on the history of science in antiquity. He originally gained prominence as an advocate of [[atheism]] and [[metaphysical naturalism]], authoring many articles on [[Internet Infidels|The Secular Web]] and later defending his basic position in his book ''Sense and Goodness Without God.''

His blog appeared on Freethought Blogs and he has frequently been a featured speaker at various skeptic, secular humanist, [[freethought]] and atheist conventions, such as the annual [[Freethought Festival]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], the annual [[Skepticon]] convention in [[Springfield, Missouri]] and conventions sponsored by [[American Atheists]]. In 2016, he left the Freethought Blogs network.

Carrier has frequently debated with Christian apologists such as [[William Lane Craig]] and David Marshall both in person and online. The Craig debate was broadcast on [[Lee Strobel]]'s television show ''[[Faith Under Fire]]''.&lt;ref name="Audio Archive of Debate"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/RichardCarrierVs.WilliamLaneCraigDebateonFaithUnderFire Audio Archive of Debate]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
His recent books on the [[historicity of Jesus]] have established him as a leading supporter of the [[Christ myth theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Casey |authorlink=Maurice Casey |title=Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? |publisher=Bloomsbury T&amp;T Clark |year=2014 |pages=14–16 |isbn=9780567447623}}&lt;/ref&gt; which claims that neither the historical Jesus nor the [[biblical Jesus]] existed in reality.  Carrier asserts that in the context of his [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] methodology,{{efn-lr|name=bayesian.methodology}} the ahistoricity of Jesus{{efn-lr|name=ahistoricity.theory}} and his origin as a mythical [[deity]] are "true" (i.e. the "most probable" Bayesian conclusion),&lt;ref name="Carrier.2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lataster.2015.Bayesian" /&gt; arguing that the probability of Jesus' existence is somewhere in the range of 1/3 to 1/12000, depending on the estimates used for the computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B00QSO2S5C|title=On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt|last=Carrier|first=Richard|date=June 30, 2014|publisher=Sheffield Phoenix Press|edition=kindle|language=English|location=location 40476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all contemporary scholars of [[ancient history]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forged:Writing in the name of God|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2011|isbn=978-0-06-207863-6|page=285|first=Bart|last=Ehrman}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most biblical scholars have maintained that a historical Jesus did indeed exist &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPZ39rqaIZ0|title=Did Jesus Exist?

== Career ==
Carrier received a [[PhD]] in Ancient History from [[Columbia University]] in 2008. His thesis was entitled "Attitudes Towards the Natural Philosopher in the Early [[Roman Empire]] (100 B.C. to 313 A.D.)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Columbia University Libraries |title=Clio Holdings Information |url=http://clio.cul.columbia.edu:7018/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=8602980 |accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has published several articles and chapters in books on the subject of history and philosophy. He was formerly the editor of and a substantial contributor to [[Internet Infidels|The Secular Web]]. His contributions there include an autobiographical essay ''From Taoist to Infidel'' in which he discusses his upbringing in a benign [[Methodism|Methodist]] church, his conversion to [[Taoism]] in early adulthood, his confrontation with [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] while in the [[United States Coast Guard]], and his deeper study of religion, Christianity, and Western philosophy, which eventually led to his embrace of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infidels.org/library/modern/testimonials/carrier.html |title=From Taoist to Infidel |work=The Secular Web |date=2001 |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was reprinted in his major work defending atheism and naturalism, ''Sense and Goodness without God''.

In his contribution to ''The Empty Tomb'', Carrier argues that the earliest Christians probably believed [[Jesus]] had received a new spiritual body in the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], and that stories of his old body disappearing from its tomb were developed later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrier|first1=Richard|editor1-last=Price|editor1-first=Robert M.|editor2-last=Lowder|editor2-first=Jeffery Jay|title=The Empty Tomb: Jesus Beyond the Grave|date=2005|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=9781591022862|chapter=The Spiritual Body of Christ and the Legend of the Empty Tomb}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues it is less likely, but also possible, that the original body of Jesus was misplaced or stolen. This work was criticized by philosophy professor Stephen T.

In ''Not the Impossible Faith'', he wrote on the social and intellectual context of the rise and early development of Christianity.

=== Investigating Antony Flew's changed opinion on God ===
When reports spread in 2004 that [[Antony Flew]] changed his mind on his rejection of the existence of gods, Carrier engaged in correspondence with Flew to find out what happened and published an extensive analysis of the situation on The Secular Web, finding among other things that Flew changed his position to there being some sort of "minimal God," as in [[Deism]].  According to the author of the book in Flew's name, [[Roy Abraham Varghese]], Flew had released a statement through his publisher (without addressing Carrier's correspondence), stating, "My name is on the book and it represents exactly my opinions. I would not have a book issued in my name that I do not 100 percent agree with. I needed someone to do the actual writing because I’m 84 and that was Roy Varghese’s role.

=== Investigating quotes attributed to Adolf Hitler regarding Christianity ===
{{see also|Hitler's Table Talk}}
Richard Carrier, in collaboration with Reinhold Mittschang, challenged several anti-Christian statements attributed to [[Adolf Hitler]] in his collection of monologues known as the ''Table Talk''. Carrier's paper argues that the French and English translations are "entirely untrustworthy"&lt;ref name="TableTalk"&gt;[https://media.8ch.net/pdfs/src/1429265963793.pdf "'Hitler's Table Talk': Troubling Finds."] ''German Studies Review'' 26 (3): 561–576.&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests the possibility that [[François Genoud]] had doctored portions of the text to enhance Hitler's views.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier (2003), [https://www.scribd.com/doc/264203378/Carrier-tabletalk-1432747-pdf#page=5 p. 565.]&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier put forward a new translation of twelve quotations based on [[Henry Picker]] and [[Werner Jochmann]]'s German editions, as well as a fragment from the ''Bormann-Vermerke'' preserved at the [[Library of Congress]], which challenge some of the quotations popularly used to demonstrate Hitler's hostility to Christianity. Carrier concludes that Hitler's views in the ''Table Talk'', "resemble [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s with regard to the primacy of science over theology in deciding the facts of the universe, while remaining personally committed to a more abstract [[theism]]."&lt;ref name="Carrier574"&gt;Carrier (2003), [https://www.scribd.com/doc/264203378/Carrier-tabletalk-1432747-pdf#page=14 p. 574.]&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier also maintains that throughout the ''Table Talk'' Hitler takes a cynical view of [[Catholicism]], "voicing many of the same criticisms one might hear from a candid (and bigoted) [[Protestantism|Protestant]]."&lt;ref&gt;Carrier (2003), [https://www.scribd.com/doc/264203378/Carrier-tabletalk-1432747-pdf#page=13 p. 573.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new forward to the ''Table Talk'', [[Gerhard Weinberg]] commented that "Carrier has shown the English text of the table-talk that originally appeared in 1953 and is reprinted here derives from Genoud's French edition and not from one of the German texts."&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Gerhard (2003).

=== Public debates ===
Carrier has engaged in several formal debates, both online and in person, on a range of subjects including [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], natural explanations of early Christian resurrection accounts, the [[Abortion debate|morality of abortion]], and the general credibility of the [[Bible]]. He debated [[Michael R.

The March 18, 2009 debate ''Did Jesus Rise From The Dead?'' with [[William Lane Craig]] was held at the [[Northwest Missouri State University]] and posted online in two parts by ReasonableFaithOrg (YouTube channel).

== Personal life ==
Carrier announced in 2015 that he and his wife had ended their 20-year marriage. He also revealed that he is [[polyamory|polyamorous]], and that the last two years of his marriage had an [[open relationship]] agreement, after informing his wife of his extramarital affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Carrier |url=http://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/6737 |title=Coming Out Poly + A Change of Life Venue |work=Richard Carrier Blogs |date=February 18, 2015 |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jesus ahistoricity theory ==
Carrier has authored two Jesus historicity books: ''Proving History'' and ''On the Historicity of Jesus''. The first of these books advances a methodology, based on [[Bayes' theorem]],{{efn-lr|name=bayesian.methodology}} as the standard by which all methodology for any historical study must adhere in order to be [[Soundness|logically sound]]. The second applies this methodology to the question of the historicity of Jesus, and reaches a conclusion for the ahistoricity of Jesus.{{efn-lr|name=ahistoricity.theory}} Per Carrier's Bayesian methodology,{{efn-lr|name=bayesian.methodology}} Raphael Lataster writes, "Given the problematic sources that historical Jesus scholars have access to, and the failings of many of their methods, it seems appropriate to call for a thorough, and Bayesian, analysis of the evidence in order to determine if Jesus’ historicity or ahistoricity is more probable."&lt;ref name="Lataster.2015.Bayesian" /&gt; Thus the historicist and ahistoricist argument for Jesus hinges on how well each theory predicts each item of evidence, which items of evidence count, and how they count towards the most probable Bayesian conclusion.

Carrier's first major book, ''Proving History: Bayes's Theorem and the Quest for the Historical Jesus'', published in 2012 by [[Prometheus Books]], describes the application of Bayes' theorem to historical inquiry in general and the [[historicity of Jesus]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carrier |first=Richard |title=Proving History: Bayes's Theorem and the Quest for the Historical Jesus |year=2012 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=New York |isbn=9781616145606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hitler Homer Bible Christ: The Historical Papers of Richard Carrier 1995-2013'', published January 2014, is an anthology of Carrier's published papers on history—of which some are [[peer review]]ed journal articles on the historicity of Jesus and are also cited as source references in Carrier's ''On the Historicity of Jesus''.&lt;ref name="Carrier.HHBC.2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carrier|first=Richard|title=Hitler Homer Bible Christ: The Historical Papers of Richard Carrier 1995–2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMYlnwEACAAJ|date=January 2014|publisher=Createspace Independent Pub|isbn=978-1-4935-6712-6}}{{bulleted list |The Nazareth Inscription|Thallus and the Darkness at Christ’s Death|Origen, Eusebius, and the Accidental Interpolation in Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 20.200|The Prospect of a Christian Interpolation in Tacitus, Annals 15.44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Carrier's ''On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt'' was published by [[Sheffield Phoenix Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheffieldphoenix.com/showbook.asp?bkid=264 |title=Sheffield Phoenix Press – Display Book |publisher=Sheffieldphoenix.com |date= |accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carrier |first=Richard |title=On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt |year=2014 |publisher=Sheffield Phoenix Press |isbn=9781909697355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier notes that it is "the first comprehensive pro-Jesus-myth book ever published by a respected academic press and under formal peer review."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freethoughtblogs.com/carrier/archives/4090 |title=Update on Historicity of Jesus |first=Richard |last=Carrier |date=July 17, 2013 |accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier argues that there is insufficient [[Bayesian probability]], that is evidence, to believe in the historicity of Jesus. Furthermore, he argues that a celestial Jesus figure was probably originally known only through private [[revelation]]s and hidden messages in scripture which were then crafted into a historical figure, to communicate the claims of the gospels allegorically. These allegories then began to be believed as fact during the struggle for control of the Christian churches of the first century.

''Jesus Did Not Exist: A Debate Among Atheists'', was published November 12, 2015, with foreword and afterword by Richard Carrier. The book by Raphael Lataster compares the claims of [[Bart D. Ehrman]], [[Maurice Casey]], and Richard Carrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lataster|first1=Raphael|title=Jesus Did Not Exist: A Debate Among Atheists|date=Nov 12, 2015|isbn=978-1514814420|chapter=Chapter 1 &amp; 2, Ehrman and Casey respectively|quote=Length: 458 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carrier|first1=Richard|title=Lataster on the Historicity of Jesus Being a Debate Among Atheists|url=http://freethoughtblogs.com/carrier/archives/9085|website=Richard Carrier Blogs|publisher=Freethought Blogs|accessdate=March 20, 2016|date=December 2, 2015|quote=Bart Ehrman and Maurice Casey, were neither published by academic presses, nor underwent any formal peer review. But Lataster works with what the academy has given him. And so he surveys the merits of those two books anyway. And compares them with mine, On (see below)the Historicity of Jesus, which was published by an academic press and did pass formal academic peer review.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lataster previously wrote a book review on Carrier's ''On the Historicity of Jesus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lataster|first1=Raphael|title=Richard Carrier: On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt. Sheffield: Sheffield Phoenix Press, 2014; pp. xiv + 696.|journal=Journal of Religious History|date=December 2014|volume=38|issue=4|pages=614–616|doi=10.1111/1467-9809.12219}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is used as the basis for the section on Carrier and then expanded upon for the lay reader. Per any evidence outside of the New Testament, for Jesus’s existence, Carrier writes;&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no independent evidence of Jesus’s existence outside the New Testament. All external evidence for his existence, even if it were fully authentic (though much of it isn’t), cannot be shown to be independent of the Gospels, or Christian informants relying on the Gospels. None of it can be shown to independently corroborate the Gospels as to the historicity of Jesus. Not one single item of evidence. Regardless of why no independent evidence survives (it does not matter the reason), no such evidence survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lataster|first=Raphael|authorlink=Raphael Lataster|title=Jesus Did Not Exist: A Debate Among Atheists|date=November 12, 2015|isbn=978-1514814420|page=418|chapter=Afterword by Richard Carrier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, according to Carrier, no reliable conclusion on the historicity of Jesus is possible from the so-called "independent" and "objective" sources dated after the Gospels (see [[Sources for the historicity of Jesus]]). They could be reliant on the Gospels and therefore would not be independent, nor objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lataster|first=Raphael|authorlink=Raphael Lataster|title=Questioning the Plausibility of Jesus Ahistoricity Theories — A Brief Pseudo-Bayesian Metacritique of the Sources|journal=The Intermountain West Journal of Religious Studies|date=2015|volume=6:1|pages=75|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1053&amp;context=imwjournal|quote=Richard Carrier also raises the possibility (and perhaps the need to be cautious) that all sources dated after the Gospel of Mark could have been tainted by it, and that this simply cannot be ruled out.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*"The Gospels come decades later and are the first we hear of  an earthly story for Jesus."&lt;ref name="Carrier.info.pdf" /&gt;
*"The Gospels are wildly fictitious in their content and structure."&lt;ref name="Carrier.info.pdf" /&gt;

*"The first (Mark) looks like an extended meta-parable (outsiders are told a story, while insiders are told what it really means)."&lt;ref name="Carrier.info.pdf" /&gt;

Carrier contends that apart from the [[Rank-Raglan mythotype|hero archetype pattern]], nothing else in the Gospels is reliable evidence for or against the historicity of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Lessons Bart Ehrman Needs to Learn about Probability Theory – Richard Carrier|url=http://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/11545|website=Richard Carrier|accessdate=November 17, 2016|date=November 15, 2016|quote=[A]part from what we can determine from and for the Rank-Raglan data, nothing in the Gospels argues for or against historicity: OHJ, pp. 395, 506–09.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celestial Jesus ===
Carrier asserts that originally "Jesus was the name of a celestial being, subordinate to God, with whom some people hallucinated conversations"&lt;ref name="Carrier.info.pdf" /&gt; and "The Gospel began as a mythic allegory about the celestial Jesus, set on earth, as most [[myth]]s then were"&lt;ref name="Carrier.info.pdf" /&gt; (see [[Jesus in comparative mythology]]).

[...] It would be several decades later when subsequent members of this cult, after the world had not yet ended as claimed, started allegorizing the gospel of this angelic being. By placing him in earth history as a divine man, as a commentary on the gospel and its relation to society and the Christian mission.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A celestial being, subordinate to God:
:Carrier notes, "Jesus was originally a [[Deity|god]] just like any other god (properly speaking, a [[demigod]] in pagan terms; an [[archangel]] in Jewish terms; in either sense, a deity), who was later historicized."&lt;ref name="Carrier.2014" /&gt;
*Hallucinated conversations:
:Carrier gives as example [[Joseph Smith]]—the founder of Mormonism—who declared that he had conversations with the [[Angel Moroni]].

[[Earl Doherty]] originated the premise that Jesus originated as a myth per [[Middle Platonism]] (with some influence from [[Jewish mysticism]]) and that the belief in a historical Jesus emerged only among Christian communities in the 2nd century. Doherty asserts that [[Paul the Apostle]] and other writers of the earliest existing proto-Christian [[Gnosticism#Christianity|Gnostic]] documents did not believe in Jesus as a person who was incarnated on Earth in an historical setting, rather, they believed in Jesus as a heavenly being who suffered his sacrificial death in the lower spheres of heaven, where he was crucified by demons and then was subsequently resurrected by God (see [[Dying-and-rising god]]). This mythological Jesus was not based on a historical Jesus, but rather on an [[exegesis]] of the Old Testament in the context of [[Hellenistic Judaism|Jewish-Hellenistic]] [[religious syncretism]] heavily influenced by Middle Platonism, and what the authors believed to be [[Vision (spirituality)|mystical visions]] of a risen Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Paul Rhodes|last2=Boyd|first2=Gregory A.|title=The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WgROZMp4zDMC&amp;pg=PA33|date=August 1, 2007|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-3114-4|page=33|quote=Scholars such as [G. A.] Wells, [Earl] Doherty, and [R. M.] Price argue that Paul’s view of Jesus was not anything like the recent, contemporary Galilean figure we find in the Gospels. His view of Jesus—which is the earliest view we have—was rather that of a vague cosmic savior figure who existed in the unknown, distant past and/or the mythic spiritual realm. Indeed, the Pauline Christ was actually quite close to the sorts of divinities we find in ancient mystery religions. According to these scholars, this makes it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the earliest Christians viewed Jesus as a sort of vague deity who became historicized as a rather recent figure only after Paul—as oral traditions were passed on and especially when the Gospels were written.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrier reviewed Doherty's work in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/jesuspuzzle.html Did Jesus Exist? Earl Doherty and the Argument to Ahistoricity]&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that Doherty's thesis was plausible, however, Carrier had not yet concluded it was probably more true than the minimal historicity thesis (he also noted that some of Doherty's points were untenable and that only his core thesis was at least coherent with the evidence). Carrier remained a  historicity agnostic until he began formal research on Jesus ahistoricity theory in 2008, which eventually convinced him that the evidence actually favored the core Doherty thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lataster|first=Raphael|authorlink=w:Raphael Lataster|title=Richard Carrier: On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt.

In regards to plausible theories for the origination of Jesus in relation to the founding of Christianity, the most probable is contested between three competing theories; Mythological Ahistoricity, Supernatural Historicity, and Natural Historicity. In regards to Mythological Ahistoricity, Carrier reviews Ehrman's ''How Jesus Became God'' and notes, "It does soundly establish the key point that Jesus was regarded as a pre-existent incarnate divine being from the earliest recorded history of Christianity, even in fact before the writings of Paul, and that this was not even remarkable within Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|title=How Jesus Became God: The Exaltation of a Jewish Preacher from Galilee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmspAgAAQBAJ|date=March 25, 2014|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-225219-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://freethoughtblogs.com/carrier/archives/6923 Bart Ehrman on How Jesus Became God]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Birth of a deity:
:The creation story of celestial Jesus is not known, but as Carrier notes, "This 'Jesus' would most likely have been the same archangel identified by [[Philo|Philo of Alexandria]] as already extant in Jewish theology".&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, On the Historicity of Jesus, pp. 200–05.{{bulleted list |Jesus being a preexisting archangel: Phil. 2:5–11 |Jesus was as an angel: Gal. 4:14 |Jesus knew Moses: 1 Cor. 10:4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philo knew this figure by all of the attributes [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] already knew Jesus by: the firstborn son of God ([[Epistle to the Romans]] 8:29), the celestial 'image of God' ([[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]] 4:4), and God’s agent of creation ([[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] 8:6). He was also God’s celestial high priest (Heb. 2:17, 4:14, etc.) and God’s '[[Logos]].' And Philo says this being was identified as the figure named 'Jesus' in the [[Book of Zechariah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Richard Carrier, Ph.D.|title=The Bible and Interpretation – Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt: Should We Still Be Looking for a Historical Jesus?|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/2014/08/car388028.shtml|website=www.bibleinterp.com|accessdate=May 12, 2016|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An incarnated (cloned) human body:
:When Paul writes that Jesus “came to be” from the sperm of [[David]], in the context of Jesus' [[incarnation]], this meant that an adult human body was cloned/grown from the sperm (seed) of David, for Jesus to use (Paul's previous usage of the contextually unique term Greek:genomenos—came to be—meant a human body manufactured by God). Thus Jesus possessed a surrogate human body, therefore the religious requirement for a human/god blood sacrifice was fulfilled during his subsequent [[crucifixion]] by demons. Per the incarnation of Jesus, Carrier writes, "[Paul] saying (in Phil. 2. 7) that Christ was not actually a man, but came 'in the likeness of men' (homoiomati anthropon) and was found 'in a form like a man' (schemati euretheis hos anthropos) and (in Rom. 8.3) that he was only sent 'in the likeness of sinful flesh' (en homoiomati sarkos hamartias). This is a doctrine of a preexistent being assuming a human body, but not being fully transformed into a man, just looking like one, having a flesh-and-blood body to abuse and kill."&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, On the Historicity of Jesus, p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The abodes of mythological deities:
:[[Merkabah mysticism]] is a school of early Jewish mysticism, c. 100 BCE – 1000 CE, centered on visions such as those found in the [[Book of Ezekiel]] or in the [[hekhalot literature]], concerning stories of ascents to the heavenly palaces and the Throne of God. Per the difference between ''the heavens'' and ''the firmament'' in regards to the location for the incarnation of Jesus, Carrier writes, "Mythicism places the incarnation of Jesus below the heavens ...being the whole vast region between the earth and the moon [the firmament], was well-established in both Jewish and pagan cosmology (see Element 37, Chapter 4, OHJ, pp. 184–93)."&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, On the Historicity of Jesus, pp. 184–193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Richard Carrier|title=Can Paul's Human Jesus Not Be a Celestial Jesus?|url=http://freethoughtblogs.com/carrier/archives/9710|website=Richard Carrier Blogs|accessdate=May 12, 2016|language=en-US|date=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hetherington|first=Norriss S.|title=Encyclopedia of Cosmology (Routledge Revivals): Historical, Philosophical, and Scientific Foundations of Modern Cosmology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA267|date=2014|orig-year=1st. pub. 1993|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-67766-6|page=267|quote=The seven Jewish and seven Islamic heavens may have had their origins in Babylonian astronomy rather than in Ptolemaic thinking, especially since the Jewish heavens predate the Ptolemaic.

=== Jewish and Hellenistic syncretism ===

Carrier notes four major trends in religion, occurring prior to the formation of Christianity:
#"[[Syncretism]]: combining a foreign cult deity with [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] elements."&lt;ref name="Carrier.info.pdf" /&gt;
#"[[Monotheism]]: transforming [[polytheism]] into monotheism (via [[henotheism]])."&lt;ref name="Carrier.info.pdf" /&gt;
#"[[Individualism]]: agricultural salvation cults retooled as personal salvation cults."&lt;ref name="Carrier.info.pdf" /&gt;
#"[[Cosmopolitanism]]: all races, cultures, classes admitted as equals, with fictive kinship (members are all “brothers”); you now “join” a religion rather than being born into it."&lt;ref name="Carrier.info.pdf" /&gt;

Carrier writes that per syncretism, "[[Mithraism]] was a syncretism of Persian and Hellenistic elements; the [[mysteries of Isis]] and [[Osiris]] were a syncretism of Egyptian and Hellenistic elements. Christianity is simply a continuation of the same trend: a syncretism of Jewish and Hellenistic elements. Each of these cults is unique and different from all the others in nearly every detail—but it's the general features they all share in common that reflect the overall fad that produced them in the first place, the very features that made them popular and successful within [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman culture]]."&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, On the Historicity of Jesus, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrier contends that Christianity originated from a Jewish sect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Brian Bethune|title=Did Jesus really exist? – Macleans.ca|url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/did-jesus-really-exist-2/|website=Macleans.ca|accessdate=November 19, 2016|date=March 23, 2016|quote=[A]ccording to Carrier, a solution that requires no special pleading. His take on Christianity’s origins begins in the religiously roiling Israel of the 30s, when the restive population was starting to rebel against the Temple elite. [...] Through visions, apocalyptic math and study of the Scriptures, one group ...came up with a celestial being made human flesh, killed by the forces of evil in a sacrifice that combined and eclipsed both Yom Kippur and Passover, who rose from the dead and will very soon come again to save the faithful.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dr. Richard Carrier|title=Reality Trip: Episode 040 – Dr. Richard Carrier: Is Christianity and Jesus a Myth?|url=http://www.benfamajr.com/reality-trip/2016/9/28/reality-trip-episode-040-dr-richard-carrier-is-christianity-and-jesus-a-myth|website=www.benfamajr.com|publisher=Ben Fama|accessdate=October 13, 2016|date=September 28, 2016|quote=[T]he Christians, they are a Jewish sect, they began as a sect of Jews.

[...] It would be several decades later when subsequent members of this cult, after the world had not yet ended as claimed, started allegorizing the gospel of this angelic being. By placing him in earth history as a divine man, as a commentary on the gospel and its relation to society and the Christian mission.&lt;ref name="Carrier.2014.Looking" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reception ==
''On the Historicity of Jesus'' was reviewed by Raphael Lataster in the ''[[Journal of Religious History]]'', who concurs that according to the Gospels, "Jesus fits almost perfectly" the [[Rank-Raglan mythotype]], and notes that there is "not a single confirmed historical figure" that conforms to the mythotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lataster |first1=Raphael |title=RichardCarrier: On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt. Sheffield: Sheffield Phoenix Press, 2014; pp. xiv + 696. |journal=Journal of Religious History |date=December 3, 2014 |volume=38 |issue=4 |page=614 |doi=10.1111/1467-9809.12219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrier's methodology in his work on the historicity of Christ was reviewed by Aviezer Tucker, a prior advocate of using Bayesian techniques in history. Tucker expressed some sympathy for Carrier's view of the Gospels, stating: "The problem with the Synoptic Gospels as evidence for a historical Jesus from a Bayesian perspective is that the evidence that coheres does not seem to be independent, whereas the evidence that is independent does not seem to cohere."  However, Tucker argued that historians have been able to use theories about the transmission and preservation of information to identify reliable parts of the Gospels. He said that "Carrier is too dismissive of such methods because he is focused on hypotheses about the historical Jesus rather than on the best explanations of the evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=Aviezer|title=The Reverend Bayes vs Jesus Christ|journal=History and Theory|date=February 2016|volume=55:1|pages=129–140|doi=10.1111/hith.10791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing ''On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt'', Christina Petterson of the University of Newcastle, Australia, in the academic journal ''Relegere'', writes, "Even if strictly correct, the methodology is tenuous.  In addition, the numbers and the statistics seem like a diversion or an illusionary tactic which intentionally confuse and obfuscate", and that, "Maths aside, nothing in the book shocked me, but seemed quite rudimentary first year New Testament stuff." Petterson says Carrier's conclusion that the later tales of a historical Jesus should be studied for their literary and rhetorical purpose and not for their specific historical content "reveals Carrier's ignorance of the field of New Testament studies and early Christianity", but states that "the historical Jesus haunts biblical scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petterson|first1=Christina|title=On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt|issue=2|pages=253–58|url=https://relegere.org/relegere/article/view/702/791|journal=Relegere: Studies in Religion and Reception|volume=5|accessdate=January 15, 2018|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to what he sees as the main elements in the same book,  Emeritus Professor of New Testament Language, Literature and Theology at the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Larry Hurtado]], has written that, contrary to Carrier's claims, Philo of Alexandria never refers to an archangel named Jesus. Hurtado also states that the apostle Paul clearly believed Jesus to have been a real man who lived on earth and that deities of pagan saviour cults such as Isis and Osiris, etc., were not transformed in their devotees' ideas from heavenly deities to actual people living on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hurtado|first1=Larry|title=Why the "Mythical Jesus" Claim Has No Traction with Scholars|url=https://larryhurtado.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/why-the-mythical-jesus-claim-has-no-traction-with-scholars/|website=larryhurtado.wordpress.com|accessdate=January 15, 2018|date=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus]] [[Daniel N. Gullotta]], reviewing Carrier’s ''On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt'', says Carrier has provided a "rigorous and thorough academic treatise that will no doubt be held up as the standard by which the Jesus Myth theory can be measured" though he finds Carrier's arguments "problematic and unpersuasive", his use of Bayesian probabilities "unnecessarily complicated and uninviting" and criticizes Carrier's "lack of evidence, strained readings and troublesome assumptions."  Gullotta also says that there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever, either documentary or archaeological, that there was a period when Christians believed that Jesus only existed in heaven rather than living as a human being on earth, which he says is Carrier's "foundational" thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Gullotta |first=Daniel N.|title=On Richard Carrier's Doubts: A Response to Richard Carrier's On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt|journal=Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus|year=2017|volume=15|issue=2–3|pages=310–346|doi=10.1163/17455197-01502009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{notelist-lr|refs=
&lt;ref name=bayesian.methodology&gt;Per [[probability interpretations]], Evidential probability, also called [[Bayesian probability]], can be assigned to any statement whatsoever, even when no random process is involved, as a way to represent its subjective plausibility, or the degree to which the statement is supported by the available evidence. Per ''On the Historicity of Jesus'', Carrier performs Bayesian analysis on evidential assumptions, many of which are supported by background knowledge (and thus have high probabilities of being true) and others that are not (and thus have standard chance probabilities, which reduce the prior probability accordingly).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=ahistoricity.theory&gt;Jesus ahistoricity theory is the antithesis of a given Jesus historicity thesis. Thus for the sake of argument (via Bayesian analysis), Carrier posits three criteria for his minimal historical Jesus:
#"An actual man at some point named Jesus acquired followers in life who continued as an identifiable movement after his death." (Carrier, ''On the Historicity of Jesus'', p. 34.)
#"This is the same Jesus who was claimed by some of his followers to have been executed by the Jewish or Roman authorities." (Ibid.)
#"This is the same Jesus some of whose followers soon began worshipping as a living god (or demigod)." (Ibid.)
"If any one of these premises is false, it can fairly be said there was no historical Jesus in any pertinent sense." (Ibid.)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">'''Rita Boley Bolaffio''' ([[Trieste]], Italy, 7 June 1898 - [[New York City]], United States, 20 May 1995) was an [[artist]] who was instrumental in reintroducing [[collage]] and [[decoupage]] into the United States. She created powerful artwork that underscored the importance of grace and imagination.

==Early years==
Rita was born Margherita Luzzatto to Angelo Luzzatto and Olga Senigaglia in [[Trieste]], Italy.

Her family moved to [[Vienna]], where she passed [[World War I]]. She studied [[art]] under [[Josef Hoffmann]] at the [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] and did [[textile]] designs for the renowned [[Wiener Werkstaette]] under the name Grete Luzzatto. She also studied [[violin]] under the famous violinist [[František Ondříček]].

In 1919 she married Oscar Bolaffio, an architect and engineer, and cousin of painter [[Vittorio Bolaffio]]. They moved to [[Milan]] in 1928, where Rita became one of the first horsewomen in Italy, riding [[sidesaddle]], and won the "Premio Ciglione della Malpensa" (the Ciglione della Malpensa Prize) in 1936.

==American career==
[[Image:Ritaboley2.gif|thumb|right|200px|''Machine for Writing Poetry'', circa 1955]]
[[Image:Ritaboley4.gif|thumb|left|200px|''Arabesque'', circa 1963]]

In 1939, the [[Fascist]] anti-[[Jewish]] policies forced the family to flee to [[United States|America]]. She began a career as an [[artist]], specializing in imaginative [[collages]] that were displayed in the windows of most major department stores in America, including [[Lord &amp; Taylor]], [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], [[Bergdorf Goodman]], [[Neiman Marcus]], [[Carson Pirie Scott]], and many more, as well as many private commissions. She regularly contributed covers for such magazines as [[Harper's Bazaar]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], [[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]], [[Good Housekeeping]], and [[Woman's Day]].

She had many awards and one-woman exhibitions at [[museums]] and [[art museum|galleries]] (e.g. [[James Pendleton Gallery]] in [[New York City]], [[J.L. Hudson Gallery]], [[Detroit]], [[Guild Hall Museum]], [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], N.Y. and the [[Columbia Museum of Art]] in [[South Carolina]]). Her work was showcased in the [[New York Times]], as well as European reference works on [[modern art]].

She received the [[Premio di Sorrento]] 1965 for her poem "Nell'afa".

'''Robert Gibson Tilton''' (born 1946) is an American [[televangelist]] of the [[prosperity gospel]] widely known for his [[infomercial]]-styled religious television program ''Success-N-Life'', which at its peak in 1991 aired in all 235 American TV markets (daily in the majority of them), brought in nearly $80 million per year, and was described as "the fastest growing television ministry in America."&lt;ref name="pt"&gt;"The Apple of God's Eye", produced by Robbie Gordon, ''Primetime Live'', first broadcast November 21, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JDPT"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DM/lib00377,0ED56291649D24AC.html | title=Judgment Day on `Prime Time Live' |publisher=[[Dallas Morning News]] | date=November 21, 1991 | first= Ed| last= Bark| accessdate = 2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within two years after ABC's ''[[Primetime Live]]'' examined Tilton's fundraising practices, beginning a series of investigations into the ministry, his program was taken off the air. Tilton later returned to television via his new version of ''Success-N-Life'' airing on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] and [[The Word Network]].

==Biography and the early years==
Tilton was born in [[McKinney]], [[Texas]], on June 7, 1946. He attended [[North Central Texas College|Cooke County Junior College]] and [[Texas Tech University|Texas Technological University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Balmer |first=Randall Herbert |date=2002 |title=Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=syUupeVJOz4C&amp;pg=PA578&amp;lpg=PA578&amp;dq=Robert+Tilton+born+mckinney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ANCxf05uof&amp;sig=sQqHjMFJc0Ai0i0fBRv2mKmPDBc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9iInk34nYAhWHsY8KHTGmBMcQ6AEIVjAL#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |page=578 |isbn=978-0-6642-2409-7 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tilton's autobiographical materials, he had a conversion experience to evangelical Christianity in 1969&lt;ref name="RTTS"&gt;[http://www.robert-tilton.com/ "Robert Tilton – The Story"], Robert-Tilton.com, retrieved June 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and began his ministry in 1974, taking his new family (including then wife Martha "Marte" Phillips, whom he married in 1968) on the road to, in his words, "preach this gospel of Jesus."&lt;ref name="pt" /&gt; Tilton preached to small congregations and revivals throughout Texas and Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="prosperity"&gt;[http://www.biblestudymanuals.net/prosperity.htm "Prosperity and Healing: Is it Promised to the Believer?], Ken L. Sarles, retrieved June 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Tilton and his family settled in [[Dallas, Texas]], and built a small nondenominational [[charismatic movement|charismatic]] church in [[Farmers Branch, Texas]], called the "Word Of Faith Family Church" in 1976.&lt;ref name="prosperity" /&gt; The church also started a local television program then known as ''Daystar'' (not related to the [[Daystar Television Network]], though both were started in the Dallas area).  Tilton's announcer on ''Daystar'' was Miami radio personality and [[voice-over]] artist [[Dave Mitchell (radio personality)|Dave Mitchell]], who was based in Dallas at the time.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Tilton's young church was growing steadily, but ''Daystar'' failed to expand beyond the Dallas area until Tilton went to Hawaii—his self-described version of Jesus's forty days in the wilderness&lt;ref name="baradell"&gt;"Robert Tilton's Heart of Darkness", Scott Baradell, first published in the ''Dallas Observer'' on February 6, 1992, p. 18; quoted in ''Christianity In Crisis'' by Hank Hanegraaff, Harvest House Publishers, 1993, p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;—and spent time fishing, drinking, and watching an increasingly popular new form of television programming: the late-night [[infomercial]].

Tilton was particularly influenced by [[Dave Del Dotto]], a real estate promoter who produced hour-long infomercials showing his glamorous life in Hawaii (which he constantly stressed anyone could achieve just by following the principles set up in his many "get rich quick" books) as well as "interviews" with students who were brought out to his Hawaiian villa for said interviews, specifically for their on-camera testimonials about the success in life they were now enjoying thanks to his teachings.&lt;ref name="baradell" /&gt; Upon his return from Hawaii in 1981, Tilton, with the help of a US$1.3M loan from Dallas banker [[Herman Beebe]],&lt;ref name="pt" /&gt; revamped ''Daystar'' into an hour-long "religious infomercial" with the title ''Success-N-Life''.&lt;ref name="baradell" /&gt;

==''Success-N-Life''==
In ''Success-N-Life'', Tilton regularly taught that all of life's trials, especially poverty, were a result of [[sin]]. Tilton's ministry consisted mainly of impressing upon his viewers the importance of making "vows"—financial commitments to Tilton's ministry. His preferred vow, stressed frequently on his broadcasts, was $1,000.&lt;ref name="PTYT"&gt;{{YouTube|E3rICdWvzMA|"The Apple of God's Eye"}}, ABC News, ''Primetime Live'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, Tilton would claim to have received a [[word of knowledge]] for someone to give a vow of $5,000 or even $10,000. When a person made a vow to Tilton, he preached that God would recognize the vow and reward the donor with vast material riches.&lt;ref name="cephas_second_coming"&gt;[http://www.cephasministry.com/evangelists_second_coming_tilton.html  "Second Coming: A Jet-Settin', Scotch-Sippin' Robert Tilton Washes Up in South Florida and He Still Wants Your Money"], Sean Rowe, ''[[Dallas Observer]]'', quoted by Cephas Ministries, retrieved June 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The show also ran "testimonials" of viewers who gave to Tilton's ministry and reportedly received miracles in return, a practice that would be used as the basis for a later lawsuit from donors charging Tilton's ministry with fraud.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;''CBS Nightly News with Connie Chung'', CBS, first broadcast April 22, 1994; as compiled on ''The Prophet of Prosperity: Robert Tilton and the Gospel of Greed'', DVD produced by The Trinity Foundation, publication date not specified.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' story published in 1992 observed that Tilton spent more than 84 percent of his show's airtime for fundraising and promotions, a total higher than the 22 percent for an average commercial television show;&lt;ref name="dalmornnews"&gt;"TV Preachers Seen as 'Beggars': Public Dislikes Evangelists' Onscreen Methods", ''Dallas Morning News'', first published on November 21, 1992; quoted in ''Christianity in Crisis'' by Hank Hanegraaff, Harvest House Publishers, 1993, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; other sources put the total fundraising time during episodes of ''Success-N-Life'' closer to 68 percent.&lt;ref name="television_ministries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cephasministry.com/television_ministries.html|title=A Myth Shattered: New Report Shows Christian TV Ministries Not Focused on Money|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Tilton's fundraising letters were written by [[Gene Ewing]], who heads a multimillion-dollar marketing empire writing donation letters for other televangelists like [[W.&amp;nbsp;V.

As a result of Tilton's television success, Word of Faith Family Church (renamed "Word of Faith Family Church and World Outreach Center") grew to become a [[megachurch]], with 8,000 members at its height.&lt;ref name="prosperity" /&gt;

Tilton is the author of several self-help books about financial success, including ''The Power to Create Wealth'', ''God's Laws of Success'', ''How to Pay Your Bills Supernaturally'', and ''How to be Rich and Have Everything You Ever Wanted''. Most of Tilton's books were published in the 1980s and distributed via promotion on ''Success-N-Life'' and through the many mailings Tilton's ministry sent his followers. The books were republished in the late 1990s to be used as centerpieces of his 1997 infomercial series and are now promoted on his current ({{as of|2010|lc=yes}}) daily live internet broadcast.&lt;ref name="sil"&gt;[http://www.roberttiltonlive.com/home.html ''Success-N-Life''] home page, retrieved March 03, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry and fundraising scandal==
In 1991, [[Diane Sawyer]] and [[ABC News]] conducted an investigation of Tilton (as well as two other Dallas-area televangelists, [[W.&amp;nbsp;V. Grant]] and [[Larry Lea]]). The investigation, assisted by [[Trinity Foundation (Dallas)|Trinity Foundation]] president [[Ole Anthony]] and broadcast on ABC's ''[[Primetime Live]]'' on November 21, 1991, alleged that Tilton's ministry threw away [[prayer]] requests without reading them, keeping only the accompanying money or valuables sent to the ministry by viewers, garnering his ministry an estimated US$80 million a year.&lt;ref name="pt" /&gt;

===Allegations of exploitation of vulnerable people===
[[Ole Anthony]], a Dallas-based minister whose [[Trinity Foundation (Dallas)|Trinity Foundation]] church works with the homeless and the poor on the east side of Dallas, first took an interest in Tilton's ministry in the late 1980s after some of the people coming to the Trinity Foundation for help told him they had lost all of their money making donations to some of the higher profile televangelists, especially fellow Dallas-area minister Robert Tilton. Curious about the pervasiveness of the problem, the Trinity Foundation got on the mailing lists of several televangelists, including Tilton, and started keeping records of the many types of solicitations they received almost daily from various ministries.

Former [[Coca-Cola]] executive Harry Guetzlaff came to the Trinity Foundation after he had been turned away from Tilton's church when he found himself on hard times following a divorce. He had been a longtime high-dollar donor and gave up his last $5,000 as a "vow of faith" just weeks earlier. Guetzlaff's experience, combined with the sheer magnitude of mailings from Tilton's ministry, spurred Anthony, a former intelligence officer in the [[United States Air Force]] and licensed private investigator, to start a full investigation of Tilton's ministry. Guetzlaff joined Anthony in the task of gathering details on Tilton's operation and later did much of the legwork in finding and following the paper trail for the ABC News investigation.&lt;ref name="trinity"&gt;[http://www.trinityfi.org/press/newyorker.html "The Antichrist of East Dallas"], Burkhard Bilger, ''[[The New Yorker]]'', first published on December 6, 2004; retrieved June 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undercover investigation===
In a November 21, 1991, promotional appearance for the ''Primetime Live'' televangelist investigation on ''[[Live! with Kelly and Michael|Live with Regis and Kathie Lee]]'', Diane Sawyer said that she had watched several televangelist programs, including Robert Tilton's ''Success-N-Life'', during her travels as a reporter and was "fascinated" by them, but also "disturbed".  Stressing that she knew how sensitive people always are to reporters questioning religion, she said that she spoke with other reporters, and then eventually to ABC producers, who then decided to conduct their own investigation into a number of the more prominent televangelists, eventually settling in 1991 on the three featured in the ''Primetime Live'' episode: W.&amp;nbsp;V. Grant, Larry Lea, and Tilton.&lt;ref name="LiveRegisKathieLee"&gt;''[[Live! with Kelly and Michael|Live with Regis and Kathie Lee]]'', aired November 21, 1991, as compiled on ''The Prophet of Prosperity: Robert Tilton and the Gospel of Greed'', DVD produced by The Trinity Foundation, publication date not specified.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sawyer, the ABC producers, including Tilton segment producer Robbie Gordon, learned about possible resources available from Ole Anthony and the Trinity Foundation, and contacted Trinity for information on Tilton. After comparing their accumulated notes, data and details, the two groups decided to pool their efforts and began planning the undercover portion of the story. Anthony agreed to portray himself as a Dallas-based minister with a small church looking into the ways televangelist ministries could grow so quickly, and the ABC producers would pose as Anthony's "media consultants."&lt;ref name="LiveRegisKathieLee" /&gt;

===Meeting with Response Media===
The team, armed with hidden cameras and microphones, arrived for a meeting at Response Media, the [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]]-based marketing firm handling Tilton's mass mailings, to discuss a proposal sent by Anthony to Response Media about fundraising for a religious-based TV talk show. The director of Response Media, Jim Moore, described for Anthony and the hidden cameras (concealed in the undercover ''Primetime Live'' producers' glasses and handbags) many techniques used by Tilton to raise funds for his ministry. Moore also said that Tilton was doing "far better than anyone knows" and described the main strategy Tilton employed for such a high return rate on his mailings—that is, send the recipient a "gimmick" that compelled the recipient to mail something back in return, and most recipients would include some money along with it. Moore declined to disclose how much Response Media was paid for its services or how much money the mailings were generating for the Tilton ministry.&lt;ref name="pt" /&gt;

However, as part of his sales pitch to Anthony, Moore disclosed that the response letters generated by the fundraising mailings Response Media sends out for its clients were never delivered to the client; instead, they were sent unopened to the client's financial institution or other institutions of choice. "You never have to touch it", Moore added in response to a clarification question from Ole Anthony about dealing with the gimmick objects sent to the potential donors in the mails. One of the ABC producers asked whether this was a standard practice—"So the mail goes straight to the bank?"—and Moore asserted that it was: "The mail goes to the bank, and they put the money in your account. We just get the paper with the person's name and how much they gave."&lt;ref name="pt" /&gt;

=== 1991 ''Primetime Live'' documentary ("The Apple of God's Eye") ===
Trinity Foundation members, acting on this information, started digging through [[dumpsters]] outside Tilton's many banks in the [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] area as well as dumpsters outside the office of Tilton's lawyer, J.&amp;nbsp;C. Joyce (also based in Tulsa). Over the next 30 days, Trinity's "garbologists", as Anthony dubbed them,&lt;ref name="trinity" /&gt; found tens of thousands of discarded prayer requests, bank statements, computer printouts containing the coding for how Tilton's "personalized" letters were generated, and more, all of which were shown in detail on the Tilton segment within the ''Primetime Live'' documentary, now titled "The Apple of God's Eye".&lt;ref name="pt" /&gt; In a follow-up broadcast on November 28, 1991, ''Primetime Live'' host Diane Sawyer said that the Trinity Foundation and ''Primetime Live'' assistants found prayer requests in bank dumpsters on 14 separate occasions in a 30-day period.&lt;ref name="pt_follow_up"&gt;Follow-up segment to "The Apple of God's Eye", ''Primetime Live'', first broadcast November 28, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denial===
Tilton vehemently denied the allegations and took to the airwaves on November 22, 1991, on a special episode of ''Success-N-Life'' entitled "Primetime Lies" to air his side of the story. Tilton asserted that the prayer requests found in garbage bags shown on the ''Primetime Live'' investigation were stolen from the ministry and placed in the dumpster for a sensational camera shot, and that he prayed over every prayer request received, to the point that he "laid on top of those prayer requests so much that 'the chemicals actually got into [his] bloodstream, and... [he] had two small strokes in [his] brain."&lt;ref name="pt_follow_up" /&gt; Tilton remained defiant on claims regarding his use of donations to his ministry to fund various purchases, asking, "Ain't I allowed to have nothing?" with regards to his ownership of multiple multimillion-dollar estates. Tilton also claimed that he needed plastic surgery to repair capillary damage to his lower eyelids from ink that seeped into his skin from the prayer requests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salon.com/people/feature/2000/11/21/tilton/ [http://www.salon.com/people/feature/2000/11/21/tilton/ Oh God, You Devil – Salon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further revelations===
After Trinity Foundation members spent weeks poring over the details of the documents they and ABC had uncovered, sorting and scrutinizing each prayer request, bank statement, and computer printout dealing with the codes Tilton's banks and legal staff used when categorizing the returned items, Ole Anthony called a press conference in December 1991 to present what he described as Tilton's "Wheel of Fortune", using a large display covered in actual prayer requests, copies of receipts for document disposition, and other information which demonstrated what happened to money and prayer requests which the average viewer of Tilton's television program sent him.&lt;ref name="the_prophet_of_prosperity"&gt;''The Prophet of Prosperity: Robert Tilton and the Gospel of Greed'', DVD produced by The Trinity Foundation, publication date not specified.&lt;/ref&gt; When both Tilton and his lawyer J.&amp;nbsp;C. Joyce reacted to the news by claiming the items Anthony was displaying had somehow been stolen by "an insider", Anthony responded in a subsequent interview that "Joyce was our mole—a lot of this stuff came from the dumpster outside his office."&lt;ref name="the_prophet_of_prosperity" /&gt;

''Primetime Live's'' original investigation and subsequent updates included interviews with several former Tilton employees and acquaintances. In the original investigation, one of Tilton's former prayer hotline operators claimed the ministry cared little for desperate followers who called for prayer, saying Tilton had a computer installed in July 1989 to make sure the phone operators talked to no caller for longer than seven minutes. The former employee also revealed very specific instructions were given to them in terms of how to talk with callers and they were told to always ask for a $100 "vow" at a minimum. Also in the original report, a former friend of Tilton's from college (who remained anonymous and was shown in silhouette) claimed both he and Tilton would attend tent revival meetings as a "sport" and would claim to be anointed and healed at the meetings. He added the two had often discussed the notion that after graduation they would set up their own roving revival ministry "and drive around the country and get rich." In a July 1992 update to the investigation, ''Primetime Live'' interviewed Tilton's former maid, who claimed prayer requests which were sent to Tilton's house by the ministry were routinely ignored until he told her to move them out of the house and into the garage; according to the maid, "they stacked up and stacked up" in Tilton's garage until he had them thrown away. In the same interview, Tilton's former secretary came forward and claimed Tilton lifted excerpts from "get rich quick" books and used them in his sermons, and she never saw him perform normal pastoral duties such as visiting with the sick and praying with members.&lt;ref name="pt_follow_up" /&gt;

===Government involvement===
Despite Tilton's repeated denials of misconduct, the State of Texas and the federal government became involved in subsequent investigations, finding more causes for concern about Tilton's financial status with each new revelation. After nearly 10,000 pounds of prayer requests and letters to the Tilton ministry were found in a disposal bin at a Tulsa area recycling firm in February 1992, along with itemized receipts of their delivery from Tilton's main mail-handling service in Tulsa rather than from the church offices in Farmers Branch, Tilton admitted in a deposition given to the Texas Attorney General's office that he often prayed over computerized lists of prayer requests instead of the actual prayer requests themselves, and that prayer requests were in fact routinely thrown away after categorization.&lt;ref name="the_prophet_of_prosperity" /&gt;

As each revelation became increasingly more damaging, viewership and donations declined dramatically. The last episode of ''Success-N-Life'' aired nationally on October 30, 1993. By that time, viewership had fallen 85 percent and monthly donations went from $8 million to $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinityfi.org/press/tilton3.html|title=The Resurrection of Robert Tilton|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728130645/http://www.trinityfi.org/press/tilton3.html|archivedate=28 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failed libel action===
In 1992, Tilton sued ABC for libel because of its investigation and report, but the case was dismissed in 1993. Federal Judge [[Thomas Rutherford Brett]], in his July 16, 1993, dismissal of the case, stated that information in the Trinity Foundation's logs on prayer requests reportedly found in dumpsters on September 11, 1991, "could not have been found then because the postmark date was after September 11, 1991", but also noted that Ole Anthony had recanted the erroneous entries in a subsequent affidavit.&lt;ref name="dallas_observer_unfair_park"&gt;"[http://www.dallasobserver.com/blogs/?p=1127 The Robert Tilton Files]", Glenna Whitley, ''[http://www.dallasobserver.com/ Dallas Observer "Unfair Park"]'' online blog, dated August 6, 2006; retrieved October 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Tilton appealed the decision in 1993; although the findings of the original court were upheld in 1995, federal Judge [[Michael Burrage]]'s opinion criticized ABC and the ''Primetime Live'' producers for their editing of the story and noted that ABC had been warned by their own religion editor, Peggy Wehmeyer (who knew Ole Anthony from her work as a religion reporter at ABC affiliate [[WFAA-TV]] in Dallas), that "Mr. Anthony could not be trusted and was obsessed with his crusade against [Tilton]."&lt;ref name="dallas_observer_unfair_park" /&gt; Tilton once more appealed the decision, this time to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] in 1996, but the court refused to hear the case.&lt;ref name="pfo"&gt;[http://www.pfo.org/tltn-ret.htm "Tilton Returns to Airwaves"], Personal Freedom Outreach, retrieved June 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tilton sued for fraud ===
Several donors to Tilton's television ministry sued Tilton in 1992–1993, charging various forms of fraud. One plaintiff, Vivian Elliott, won $1.5 million in 1994 when it was discovered that a family crisis center for which she had made a donation (and recorded an endorsement testimonial) was never built or even intended to be built.&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt; The judgment was later reversed on appeal.&lt;ref name="tulsaworld"&gt;[http://www.trinityfi.org/press/tulsaworld02.html "Robert Tilton: From Downfall to Windfall"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050219093050/http://www.trinityfi.org/press/tulsaworld02.html |date=2005-02-19 }}, Ziva Branstetter, ''Tulsa World'', first published May 4, 2003; quoted by The Trinity Foundation, retrieved June 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the defense strategy to the fraud cases, Tilton sued Ole Anthony, Harry Guetzlaff and four plaintiff's lawyers who had filed the fraud cases against him in federal court in Tulsa. The tactic is known to critics as a "SLAPP" ([[strategic lawsuit against public participation]]) suit. Tilton claimed that the individuals conspired to violate his First Amendment rights under a post–Civil War federal statute designed to protect blacks from the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. ([[Enforcement Act of 1871 (third act)|42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985.]]) Defense attorneys Martin Merritt of Dallas and [[ACLU]] lawyer Michael Linz, also of Dallas, with others won dismissal for the six defendants in federal district court. On appeal, in ''Tilton v. Richardson'', 6 F.3d 683 (10th Cir.1993), the [[10th Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed the dismissal on the grounds that 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985 did not protect a nonminority individual against a purely private conspiracy, if one existed. The fraud cases continued until the [[Texas Supreme Court]] eventually ruled that the plaintiffs could not prove damages because they could not show that, if Tilton had actually prayed over the prayer requests, the prayers would have been answered.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The decline of ''Success-N-Life'' also led to the end of Tilton's 25-year marriage to his wife Marta, who had been administrative head of the Word of Faith Family Church and World Outreach Center, in 1993. Dallas lawyer Gary Richardson, who represented many of the parties suing Tilton for fraud, attempted to intervene in the Tiltons' divorce, citing the potential for the divorce settlement to be used to hide financial assets that were currently part of the many fraud cases; Richardson's petition to have the divorce action put on hold until after the fraud cases were settled was denied.&lt;ref name="the_prophet_of_prosperity" /&gt; Marte intervened in Tilton's second divorce from Leigh Valentine, who had asked the court to include the church and all its property as community property in the proceedings. Under Texas law, property accumulated during a marriage is considered community property and thus subject to division between the parties in a divorce. The jury eventually ruled against the request.&lt;ref name="divorce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1997/march3/7t363b.html|title=Tilton's Church to Retain Assets|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexington Academy==
Lexington Academy was a small private Christian school in [[Farmers Branch, Texas]] (a suburb of Dallas), that was founded in the early 1980s by Robert Tilton and his wife Marte.  The name "Lexington" was chosen in honor of the [[Battle of Lexington]]. The school mascot was the Patriots. The school was a member of TAPPS ([[Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools]]), and won dozens of State Championships in Athletics, Academics, and Fine Arts during the less than 20 years of its existence, including five overall TAPPS State Championships.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tapps.net/index.html

==Transitional ministry==
Tilton returned to television in 1994 with a new show called ''Pastor Tilton'', a show with an emphasis on "demon blasting" [[exorcism]] practices, usually involving Tilton shouting as loudly as possible at [[demon]]s supposedly possessing people suffering from pain and illness. However, this program was far less successful than its predecessor, and was cancelled by the end of the year.

==Reviving ''Success 'N' Life''==
&lt;!-- FAIR USE of bobandmaria.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:bobandmaria.jpg for rationale --&gt;
After moving to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], in 1996, Tilton returned to the airwaves in 1997 with a new version of ''Success-N-Life'', buying airtime on independent television stations primarily serving inner-city areas. The new version of ''Success-N-Life'' returned to Tilton's previous message of asking for "vows of faith" from viewers instead of exorcisms. In 1998, the program began airing on [[Black Entertainment Television]] (BET) as part of the two-hour late night [[umbrella rotation]] block of religious programming entitled ''BET Inspiration''. In 2008, ''Success-N-Life'' usually occupied the first hour of the programming block and also ran on [[The Word Network]].&lt;ref name="twn1"&gt;[http://thewordnetwork.org/programs.php?showID=415 The Word Network] program listing page, retrieved January 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the episodes of ''Success-N-Life'' shown on ''BET Inspiration'' were taped in the late 1990s—with testimonials from 1980s-era episodes interspersed throughout the episodes&lt;ref name="cephas_second_coming" /&gt;—but Tilton also recorded infomercials for his books at least once a year from 2003 to 2007, often appearing with his third wife, Maria Rodriguez, and their four [[poodle|French poodles]]. These infomercials also appeared under the title of ''Success-N-Life'' on ''BET Inspiration''.&lt;ref name="dmn1"&gt;[http://www.trinityfi.org/press/dallasnews-tilton.html "Bob's Back, and More Entertaining than Ever"], Steve Blow, ''Dallas Morning News'', published September 25, 2004, retrieved June 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Word of Faith Family Church and World Outreach Center was finally formally dissolved by Tilton in 1996. Though Tilton was still listed as the church's senior pastor, he had not preached at the church since March 16, 1996, when he named [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], minister Bob Wright as senior associate pastor,&lt;ref name="cephas_second_coming" /&gt; and its membership had declined to less than 300.&lt;ref name="the_prophet_of_prosperity" /&gt; The church building was purchased by the city of [[Farmers Branch, Texas|Farmers Branch]] in 1999 for use as a future civic center; however, the economy suffered a downturn and the plans were scrapped, and the building was finally demolished in 2003 to make room for a new [[Dallas Stars]]-sponsored youth hockey center.

In March 2005, Tilton started a new church in [[Hallandale, Florida]], not far from his home in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]]. The church had already existed for some time under the pastorship of former [[televangelist]] [[David Epley]]. Tilton's new church, now called "Christ the Good Shepherd Worldwide Church", had approximately 200 members in 2007. On May 13, 2007, the church moved into a new location in Miami and was officially renamed "Word of Faith Church", much like his original church in Dallas. Tilton also established a church in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], in 2005, also originally named Christ the Good Shepherd Worldwide Church. It has also been officially renamed "Word of Faith Church". The Las Vegas church's resident pastor is Natalie Vafai.

==Current ministry==
When Tilton returned to television in 1997, he established his ministry's headquarters in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], where his lawyer J.&amp;nbsp;C. Joyce's offices were located, and set up a [[post office box]] as its mailing address. A woman employed by Mail Services, Inc., a Tulsa-area clearinghouse that handled mail sent to Tilton's ministry, said that when she worked for Mail Services, Inc. in 2001, prayer requests were still routinely thrown away after donations and pledges were removed.&lt;ref name="tulsaworld" /&gt; However, Tilton dropped the Tulsa address in late 2007 and used a Miami Post Office box to receive responses to his fundraising mailings. In January 2014, Tilton is currently holding services at the [[Courtyard Marriott]] in [[Culver City, California]], while having donations again sent to a post office box in Tulsa.

In 1998, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Tilton's following disappeared after the investigations but he had "joined dozens of other preachers to become fixtures on BET".&lt;ref name="Whitepreachers"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-669259.html?refid=gg_x_02 | title=White Preachers Born Again on Black Network; TV Evangelists Seek to Resurrect Ministries  | work=The Washington Post |date=September 3, 1998 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Tilton, along with [[Don Stewart (preacher)|Don Stewart]] and [[Peter Popoff]] received "criticism from those who say that preachers with a long trail of disillusioned followers have no place on a network that holds itself out as a model of entrepreneurship for the black community."&lt;ref name="Whitepreachers"/&gt;

Steve Lumbley, who worked for Tilton's ministry in 1991 when the original ''Primetime Live'' investigation took place, told a reporter for the ''Dallas Observer'' in 2006 that reports of prayer request disposal that were the centerpiece of the 1991 ''Primetime Live'' exposé were highly exaggerated. In an article for the dallasobserver.com blog "Unfair Park",  Lumbley asserted that "[t]he mailings all had some kind of gimmick. They weren't godly at all. But the primary allegation that came out of that—that prayer requests were thrown away—was categorically untrue, and I can guarantee you that was not a normal practice." However, Lumbley, who now runs a Christian watchdog website called ApostasyWatch.com, does credit ABC and the Trinity Foundation for exposing Tilton's unethical fundraising tactics, noting that "God was using Ole and ABC to chastise Tilton and bring him down."&lt;ref name="dallas_observer_unfair_park" /&gt;

The Trinity Foundation still monitors Tilton's television ministry as part of Trinity's ongoing televangelist watchdog efforts.  In a 2003 interview published in ''Tulsa World'', Ole Anthony estimated that with none of the Word of Faith Family Church overhead and with television production costs at a fraction of the original ''Success-N-Life'' program, Tilton's current organization was likely grossing more than $24 million per year tax-free.&lt;ref name="tulsaworld" /&gt;

==Satire==
In 1985, two men began distributing a video they compiled lampooning Tilton and his ostensible conversations with God.  The video exploits Tilton's facial expressions and preaching style. The original video contained no title screen and was roughly edited. The video featured a medley of footage from ''Success-N-Life'' overdubbed with well-timed sound effects of [[flatulence]]. Unofficial VHS copies of the video circulated in the United States through the late 1980s under such titles as ''Tooting Tilton'', ''Heaven Only Knows'' (the first title by the original distributors), ''Pastor Gas'', ''The Joyful Noise'', and ''The Farting Preacher''. After the hosts of ''[[The Mark &amp; Brian Show]]'', a radio program in Los Angeles, mentioned the video on the air, the video's authors saw the market potential and began selling official copies of their creation. Similar videos have since been made with more recent footage of Tilton and are distributed throughout the Internet, all under the ''Farting Preacher'' name. The video distribution (including digital bootlegs distributed online) expanded public awareness of  Tilton and his controversial television ministry.&lt;ref name="the_prophet_of_prosperity" /&gt;

The song "I Know" on the [[Barenaked Ladies]]' 1996 album ''[[Born on a Pirate Ship]]'' includes the lines "If a hundred monkeys each could get their own show / perhaps one day a chimp might say:

&lt;blockquote&gt; followed by a sample of Tilton saying "and you have faith! You just need to use it, saith the Lord."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The musician Pogo created the song, "Hoo Ba Ba Kanda" using the sounds and words of Tilton from his "Life-N-Success" program.

The comedy material of [[Ron White]] also includes mention of Tilton. In the opening to White's act in the first ''[[Blue Collar Comedy Tour]]'' movie, Ron claims that "while sitting in a beanbag chair naked eating Cheetos", he finds Tilton on TV and believes Tilton is talking specifically to him: "Are you lonely?" "Yeah." "Have you wasted half your life in bars pursuing sins of the flesh?" "This guy's good..." "Are you sitting in a beanbag chair naked eating Cheetos?" Ron gapes in horror before squeaking, "...Yes sir!" "Do you feel the urge to get up and send me a thousand dollars?" (pause for effect) "Close! I thought he was talking about ''me'' there for a second.  Apparently, I ain't the only cat on the block (who) digs Cheetos!"&lt;ref name="the_prophet_of_prosperity" /&gt;

In the early 2000s, the [[Trinity Foundation (Dallas)|Trinity Foundation]] put together a number of news broadcasts, including the initial ''Primetime Live'' piece, from the years surrounding the investigations into Tilton's ministry on a DVD entitled ''The Prophet of Prosperity:  Robert Tilton and the Gospel of Greed''. The DVD also includes segments from ''[[The Daily Show]]'s'' "God Stuff" (hosted by [[Trinity Foundation (Dallas)|Trinity Foundation]] member John Bloom, a.k.a. [[Joe Bob Briggs]]), excerpts from the ''Pastor Gas'' videos, and a number of mocking music videos, as well as moments from ''Success-N-Life'' showing Tilton's more outrageous claims of "visions from God."&lt;ref name="the_prophet_of_prosperity" /&gt;

A comedian on BET's ''[[ComicView]]'' once made fun of ''Success-N-Life'', mainly because BET usually aired it immediately following their explicit music video show ''[[BET: Uncut|Uncut]]''. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The name "Tilton" is referred to in the song "Cash Cow (A Rock Opera In Three Small Acts)", from the album called ''[[Squint (album)|Squint]]'' by music artist and film director [[Steve Taylor]], where it says:

{{quote|The cash cow! The golden cash cow had a body like the great cows of ancient Egypt, and a face like the face of Robert Tilton—without the horns. And through the centuries, it has roamed the Earth like a ravenous bovine, seeking whom it may—lick! [between about 1:11 and 1:36 on the CD version]}}

Tilton's antics are also lampooned in the area of software technology by [[Douglas Crockford]]. Crockford created "The Tilton Macro Preprocessor", which he describes as "one of the ugliest programming languages ever conceived".

[[Bruce Prichard]], who portrayed Brother Love in the [[WWE]], has stated that the character was largely based on Tilton's way of speaking.

The comedian and satirist [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] criticized Tilton's [[televangelism]] ministry as fraudulent on his nationwide television program ''[[Last Week Tonight]]'' on August 17, 2015.&lt;ref name=twsChristianPost/&gt; Oliver and his team had corresponded with Tilton's Faith Worldwide Church for seven months; it began when a $20 donation was sent to the organization.&lt;ref name=twsChristianPost/&gt; Oliver explained what happened during those months: the organization sent a letter back with a $1 bill asking Oliver to "send it back" with more offerings, leading to a slew of appeals for further donations with nothing substantive in return, according to an account in the ''[[Christian Post]]'':

{{Quote|That's right&amp;nbsp;... I had to send the $1 back with an additional recommended offering of $37, which I did. So at this point, we're just two letters in and it's like having a pen pal who's in deep with some loan sharks.&lt;ref name=twsChristianPost&gt;August 17, 2015, Christian Post, [http://www.christianpost.com/news/comedian-john-oliver-lampoons-televangelists-on-last-week-tonight-show-opens-our-lady-of-perpetual-exemption-church-143003/ Comedian John Oliver Lampoons Televangelists on 'Last Week Tonight' Show; Opens Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption Church], Retrieved August 18, 2015, "...In his critique, Oliver said he and his team corresponded with televangelist Robert Tilton's Word of Faith Worldwide Church for seven months which quickly became predatory in nature..."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Oliver set up his own "televangelism" megachurch on his broadcast, which he called [[Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption]].&lt;ref name=twsChristianPost/&gt;

The Order of the Star in the East has been continually associated with being a branch of the [[Theosophical Society]], however no formal affiliation between either organisation has ever been publicly confirmed. However, The Order of the Star in the East was founded by the President of the Theosophical Society,&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Washington|Washington, Peter]] (1993). ''[[Madame Blavatsky's Baboon]]''. London: [[Secker &amp; Warburg]]. p. 132. {{ISBN|0-436-20273-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Annie Besant, because Krishnamurti was seen as the Theosophical Society's "World Teacher" so an association between the two organisations did exist.   The '''Star Amphitheatre''' was constructed in 1923-1924 at [[Balmoral Beach (New South Wales)|Balmoral Beach]] in Sydney, Australia.

It was intended as a platform for lectures by the expected 'World Teacher', widely believed at the time to be [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], and cost around 10,000 pounds. It was demolished in 1951.

A persistent urban legend in Sydney says that the Amphitheatre was built in anticipation of the [[Second Coming|second coming]], when it would provide a viewing platform for Jesus Christ's walking across the water either through, or between [[Sydney Heads]]. Some versions of the story include tickets for the spectacle being sold to a gullible public.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

{{Buddhism}}
The dictionary gives the meaning of the [[Sanskrit]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]] expression, '''Sutram''' (सूत्रम्) or [[Sūtra|Sutra]] (सूत्र), as string or thread, formula, short sentence or aphoristic rule, girdle, stroke, yarn or plan. Unique to [[Sanskrit literature]], [[Tamil literature]] and [[Pali literature]] of [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], they are short cryptic sentences, methodically written as memory-aids, stringing step by step a particular topic or text in its entirety. There are hundreds of Sanskrit texts found written in the Sutra-format such as ''Kapila Sutram'', ''[[Samkhyapravachana Sutra|Samkhya-pravachana Sutram]]'', ''[[Brahma Sutra]]'', ''[[Jaimini Sutras (Hindu astrology)|Jaimini Sutram]]'', ''[[Tatvartha Sutra]]m'', ''[[Kalpa (Vedanga)|Kalpa Sutra]]'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts|author=Ashesh Ranjan Misra|publisher=The Asiatic Society|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EkLgAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Sutras++Catalogue+of+Sanskrit+Manuscripts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ClITUan0ComJrAfPqYDYAg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Shatapatha Brahmana]] defines ''Sutram'' as the sacred thread (SB XII.ii.3), the sacred thread belonging to the first-class [[Brahmin]]s (SB V.x.16), the power to act (SB XI.iii.37), the ''sutra-tattva'' (SB XI.xxviii.16), the ''mahat-tattva'' distinguished by the power of action (SB XI.ix.19), the function of ''[[Pradhana]]'' or the subtle cause of material nature (SB XI.xii.19), or the first transformation of nature ([[Prakrti]]), endowed with the potency of activity (SB XI.xxiv.6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sutram|url= http://vedabase.net/s/sutram}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is the sacred thread that is worn by the twice-born i.e. the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas, signifying their initiation, which initiation gives them the opening or the right and the power to act in accordance with their respective dharmas; it constantly reminds them of their obligatory duties. It is also the thread that runs through, binds and activates the stages of transformation from the [[Avyakta]] (the Undefined) to the Vyakta (the Defined).

==Four main divisions==
There are four main divisions of Kalpa: [[Shrauta Sutras|Shrauta Sutram]], [[Grhya Sutras|Grihya Sutram]], [[Dharma Sutra]]m and [[Kalpa (Vedanga)|Kalpa Sutram]], and three subordinate divisions: ''Kaushika Sutram'', ''Vaitana Sutram'' and ''[[Shulba Sutras|Shulba Sutram]]''. [[Kalpa (Vedanga)|Kalpa]] represents the principle of transformation-transformation of point values, taking into consideration the totality of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human physiology:expression of Veda and Vedic literature|author=Tony Nader|publisher=Maharishi Vedic University|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-xqAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sutram, also known as [[Sutratman]], is the [[Sarira (Vedanta)|Suksmasariram]] comprising the [[Panchakosha|vijnanamayakosha]], [[Panchakosha|manomayakosha]] and [[Panchakosha|pranomayakosha]]; [[Prana]] ("vital breath"), [[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manas]] ("mind") and "understanding", these three sheaths have the nature of Sutratman. Sutram is an adjunct of [[Hiranyagarbha]] who is the origin of [[Viraj]], the gross material constituting the [[Ontological|world]]. ''Vijnanam'' is Sutram, and even though Sutram preceded Viraj as the cause of Viraj there is no difference between these two, for when there is no product i.e. Viraj, Sutram has the compact form of ''Prajnanaghanarupa'' (intelligence), it then reverts to its true undefined state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taittiriyopanishad-bhasyavartikam|publisher=Brill Archive|page=82|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WAYVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=sutram&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8i0TUclxhf-sB_OggKgI&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sutram&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Buddhist lexicon emphasis is on the meanings of the Sutras, the Sutras of the teaching of ''Aksayamati'' explain that the sutras of expedient meaning are those that teach seeming reality. The sutras of definitive meaning are those that are taught in order to reveal the ultimate reality. The former assist entry on to the path, deal with the seeming, afflicted by phenomena, how to engage in proper actions, cause weariness with cyclic existence, teach variety of terms and definitions, give detailed explanations about the sentient beings, self, etc.,. The latter guide disciples to engage in fruition, teaches about purified phenomena, shows how [[karma]]s and afflictions become exhausted, demonstrate that the cyclic existence and [[nirvana]] are indifferentiable, teaches the profound true reality that is difficult to see and realize, focuses on precise and pithy instructions for cultivating meditative concentration and teaches about the three doors to liberation, non-application, non-organizing, etc.,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Centre of the Sunlit Sky|author=Karl Brunnholzl|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|page=531|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8zeh8VAFCvAC&amp;pg=PA531&amp;dq=meaning+of+sutra&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HzYTUdbiLIT_rAf5toHABg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=meaning%20of%20sutra&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri [[Aurobindo]] had said that the fundamental necessity of our embodied life is to seek infinite creativity on a finite basis, therefore, according to the [[Theosophists]] death is a transformative experience. Sutratman, the spiritual thread, thread of life, is the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]], the golden thread of the transcendent contexts on which all the immanent incarnate of each individual human are strung like pearls on a thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Physics of the Soul|author=Amit Goswami|publisher=Hampton Road Publishing|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZ5NGFUeHbAC&amp;pg=PT89&amp;dq=sutratman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tHwTUeaVA8X7rAeolYDgAQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhagavad Gita]] VII.7&lt;/ref&gt;

The subtle principle of life is that thread whereon this life and the next life and all beings are strung ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] III.vii.2). [[Vayu]] is also known as Sutratman and Sutratman is ''svatahsiddha'' i.e. self-established. It is through [[Vāk|Vak]] (speech) a devotee attains the nature of Sutratman (Saptanna Brahmana verse 329).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suresvara’s Vartika on Saptanna Brahmana|author=Suresvaracharya|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=121|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cee-csYZUCsC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=sutratman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tHwTUeaVA8X7rAeolYDgAQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sutratman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viraj]] is described as the god marked by spatial directions, etc., who wears a body consisting of the five elements and who arises in/from the notion- "''I am everything''", before that it was Sutratman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies|author=Karl H.Potter|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=523|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCWU_ua5kxgC&amp;pg=PA523&amp;dq=sutratman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ooETUYGwB4r8rAeZuYDACA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sutratman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sun is identified with the Breath-spirit, and every being is connected with the Sun by a thread of Breath, the Sutratman, that is also a ray of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Symbolism of the Stupa|author=[[Adrian Snodgrass]]|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzqK8dDCM0UC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=sutratman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ooETUYGwB4r8rAeZuYDACA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sutratman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soul or God, as pervading the totality, is called Sutratman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=1073|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=opRLWtk7tzUC&amp;pg=PA1073&amp;dq=sutratman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ooETUYGwB4r8rAeZuYDACA&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sutratman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Forward''''' ({{lang-yi|פֿאָרווערטס|Forverts}}), formerly known as '''''The Jewish Daily Forward''''',&lt;ref name="assimilating"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.com/2015/04/the-jewish-daily-forward-is-assimilating/|title=The Jewish Daily Forward Is Assimilating|date=May 17, 2015|work=Observer|author= Matthew Kassel }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American magazine published monthly in New York City for a [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] audience. Founded in 1897 as a [[Yiddish]]-language daily, in the 21st century ''The Forward'' is a digital-first publication with online reporting; in addition monthly magazines are published in both English and Yiddish. ''The Forward'''s perspective on world and national news and its reporting on the Jewish perspective on modern United States have made it one of the most influential American Jewish publications. ''The Forward'' is published by an independent [[not-for-profit]] association. It has a politically [[Progressivism|progressive]] editorial focus.&lt;ref&gt;Ricki Hollander, [http://www.camera.org/article/jewish-journalism-focus-on-the-forward "Jewish Journalism: Focus on the Forward"], 15 November 2017, [[CAMERA]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{Yiddish Journalism}}
===Origins===
The first issue of ''Forverts'' appeared on April 22, 1897, in New York City.&lt;ref name="Manor3"&gt;Ehud Manor, ''Forward: The Jewish Daily Forward (Forverts) Newspaper: Immigrants, Socialism and Jewish Politics in New York, 1890–1917.'' Eastbourne, England: Sussex Academic Press, 2009; pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was founded by a group of about 50 [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-speaking socialists who had organized three months earlier as the Forward Publishing Association.&lt;ref name="Manor3" /&gt; The paper's name, as well as its political orientation, was borrowed from the [[German Social Democratic Party]] and its organ ''[[Vorwärts]]''.

[[File:Cahan-Abraham-bust.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Abraham Cahan]], patriarch of ''The Forward'' until 1946]]

''Forverts'' was a successor to New York's first Yiddish-language socialist newspaper, ''Di Arbeter Tsaytung'' (The Workman's Paper), a weekly established in 1890 by the fledgling Jewish trade union movement centered in the [[United Hebrew Trades]], as a vehicle for bringing socialist and trade unionist ideas to Yiddish-speaking immigrants, primarily from eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Manor4"&gt;Manor, ''Forward,'' pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dos Abend Blatt'' was established October 15, 1894 and terminated April 23, 1902. For further bibliographic information, see: Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig (eds.), ''The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s–1970s: An Annotated Bibliography: Volume 2: Migrants from Eastern and Southeastern Europe.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 555.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper had been merged into a new Yiddish daily called ''[[Dos Abend Blatt]]'' (The Evening Paper) as its weekend supplement when that publication was launched in 1894 under the auspices of the Socialist Labor Party (SLP).&lt;ref name="Manor4" /&gt; As this publication established itself, it came under increased political pressure from the de facto head of the SLP, [[Daniel De Leon]], who attempted to maintain a rigid ideological line with respect to its content.&lt;ref&gt;Manor, ''Forward,'' pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this centralizing political pressure which had been the motivating factor for a new publication.

[[File:waiting for the forwards.jpg|thumb|right|Newsboys for the ''Forward'' wait for their copies in the early morning hours in March 1913]]

Chief among the dissident socialists of the Forward Publishing Association were [[Louis Miller]] and [[Abraham Cahan]]. These two founding fathers of ''The Forward'' were quick to enlist in the ranks of a new rival socialist political party founded in 1897, the [[Social Democratic Party of America]], founded by the nationally famous leader of the 1894 [[American Railway Union]] strike, [[Eugene V. Debs]], and [[Victor L. Berger]], a German-speaking teacher and newspaper publisher from [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]. Both joined the SDP in July 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Manor, ''Forward,'' pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this political similarity, Miller and Cahan differed as to the political orientation of the paper and Cahan left after just four months to join the staff of ''The Commercial Advertiser,'' a well-established [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] newspaper also based in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Manor, ''Forward,'' pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next four years Cahan remained outside of ''The Forward'' office, learning the newspaper trade in a financially successful setting. He only returned, he later recalled in his memoirs, upon the promise of "absolute full power" over the editorial desk.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Cahan, ''Bleter fun main Leben.'' New York: Forward Association, 1927; vol. 4, pg. 342. Quoted in Manor, ''Forward,'' pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The circulation of the paper grew quickly, paralleling the rapid growth of the Yiddish speaking population of the United States. By 1912 its circulation was 120,000,&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;Christopher Gray, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E7DA1131F93AA25754C0A96E958260  "Streetscapes/The Jewish Daily Forward Building, 175 East Broadway; A Capitalist Venture With a Socialist Base"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the late 1920s/early 1930s, ''The Forward'' was a leading U.S. metropolitan daily with considerable influence and a nationwide circulation of more than 275,000&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.forward.com/about/history/ "Our history"], ''Forward'' website. Accessed April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; though this had dropped to 170,000 by 1939 as a result of changes in U.S. immigration policy that restricted the immigration of Jews to a trickle.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

Early on, ''The Forward'' defended trade unionism and moderate, democratic socialism.  The paper was a significant participant in the activities of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]]; [[Benjamin Schlesinger]], a former president of the ILGWU, became the general manager of the paper in 1923, then returned to the presidency of the union in 1928. The paper was also an early supporter of [[David Dubinsky]], Schlesinger's eventual successor.

[[File:forward roosevelt.jpg|thumb|This November 1, 1936, magazine section of ''The Forward,'' illustrates its evolution from a Socialist publication to a Social Democratic supporter of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s "New Deal"]]
The best-known writer in the ''Yiddish Forward'' was [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. although other well known Socialist literary and political figures, such as [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Morris Winchevsky]], also wrote for it.

===Modern times===
By 1962 circulation was down to 56,126 daily and 59,636 Sunday,&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827975,00.html "The Victim of Success"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', December 28, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1983 the newspaper was published only once a week, with an English supplement.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; In 1990 the English supplement became an independent weekly which by 2000 had a circulation of 26,183, while the Yiddish weekly had a circulation of 7,000 and falling.&lt;ref name=Nation&gt;Alterman, Eric (May 22, 2000). "[https://www.thenation.com/article/back-forward Back to the ''Forward'']. ''[[The Nation]]''. Retrieved April 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the influence of the Socialist Party in both American politics and in the Jewish community waned, the paper joined the American liberal mainstream though it maintained a [[social democracy|social democratic]] orientation. The English version has some standing in the Jewish community as an outlet of liberal policy analysis. For a period in the 1990s, conservatives came to the fore of the English edition of the paper, but the break from tradition didn't last. (A number of conservatives dismissed from ''The Forward'' later helped to found the modern ''[[The New York Sun|New York Sun]]''.)

The Yiddish edition has recently enjoyed a modest increase in circulation as courses in the language have become more popular among university students; circulation has leveled out at about 5,500. [[Boris Sandler]], one of the most significant contemporary secular writers in Yiddish, was the editor of the Yiddish ''Forward'' for 18 years, until March 2016; the new editor who succeeded him is [[Rukhl Schaechter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/335537/boris-sandler-retires-as-editor-of-yiddish-forward/|title=Boris Sandler Retires as Editor of Yiddish Forward|date=March 9–11, 2016|website=The Forward|access-date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Rose (May 17, 2016).

Retrieved April 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2013 to 2017, prior to the current format as a monthly magazine, ''The Forward'' was published as a newspaper in separate English weekly and Yiddish biweekly editions, and online daily. Each was effectively an independent publication with its own contents. Jane Eisner became the first female editor in chief of the English ''Forward'' in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/13/business/media/13forward.html?fta=y|title=A New Editor at the Forward|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="womensenews.org"&gt;Besa Luci, [http://womensenews.org/story/journalist-the-month/080701/eisner-breaks-glass-stelya-at-jewish-forward "Eisner Breaks Glass Stelya at Jewish Forward,"] WeNews, July 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous editor in chief was [[J.J. Goldberg]], who served from 2000 to 2007; since that time he has been editor at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=J.J. Goldberg |url=http://forward.com/author/j-j-goldberg |publisher=''Forward''. forward.com |access-date=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper maintains a left of center editorial stance.&lt;ref name="womensenews.org"/&gt;

In August 2015, ''The Forward'' received wide attention for reporting from Iran&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohler-Esses|first1=Larry|title=A Jewish Journalist's Exclusive Look Inside Iran|url=http://forward.com/news/318930/a-jewish-journalists-exclusive-look-inside-iran/|accessdate=August 19, 2015|publisher=''The Forward''|date=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a charged moment in American politics, as the U.S. Congress was ramping up to a vote on an accord reached the month before to limit Tehran's nuclear ability in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions. Assistant Managing Editor [[Larry Cohler-Esses]] was, in the words of ''[[The New York Times]]'', "The first journalist from an American Jewish pro-Israel publication to be given an Iranian visa since 1979."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gladstone|first1=Rick|title=Reporting From Iran, Jewish Paper Sees No Plot to Destroy Israel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/13/world/middleeast/reporting-from-iran-jewish-paper-sees-no-plot-to-destroy-israel.html|accessdate=August 19, 2015|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a few years, there was also a Russian edition. The website of ''The Forward'' describes its formation: "In the fall of 1995 a Russian-language edition of the Forward was launched, under the editorship of [[Vladimir Yedidowich|Vladimir "Velvl" Yedidowich]]. The decision to launch a Russian Forward in the crowded market of Russian-language journalism in New York followed approaches to the Forward Association by a number of intellectual leaders in the fast-growing émigré community who expressed an interest in adding a voice that was strongly Jewish, yet with a secular, social-democratic orientation and an appreciation for the cultural dimension of Jewish life."

The Russian edition was sold to [[RAJI]] (Russian American Jews for Israel) in 2004, although initially it kept the name.&lt;ref name=Voice&gt;Murphy, Jarrett (January 11, 2005). "[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/forward-backlash-6405283 ''Forward'' Backlash]". ''[[The Village Voice]]''. Retrieved April 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to its English counterpart, the Russian edition and its readership were more sympathetic to right-wing voices. In March 2007, it was renamed the ''Forum''.

Around the same time in 2004, the Forward Association also sold off its interest in [[WEVD]] to [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s sports division, [[ESPN Inc.|ESPN]].

The name of the publication was shortened to ''The Forward'' in April 2015.&lt;ref name="assimilating" /&gt;

As of July 2016 the Forward began publishing a monthly magazine.  The last newspaper published was the June 30, 2016 issue.&lt;ref&gt;Sore-Rokhl Schaechter: [http://yiddish.forward.com/articles/196439/big-changes-ahead-at-the-forverts/?p=all “Groyse enderungen baym ''Forverts''.”] Online April 28, 2016, in print May 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable columns===
For 24 years, ''The Forward'' was the home of the column "[[Philologos]]". It now runs in ''[[Mosaic Magazine|Mosaic]]''.&lt;ref name="Eisner"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eisher|first1=Jane|title=Farewell Philologos|url=http://forward.com/opinion/210464/farewell-philologos/|accessdate=February 13, 2017|work=The Forward|date=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joins"&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Editors|title=Philologos Joins Mosaic|url=https://mosaicmagazine.com/observation/2015/01/philologos-joins-mosaic/|accessdate=February 13, 2017|work=[[Mosaic Magazine|Mosaic]]|date=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of its popularity, the Forward erected a ten-story office building at 175 [[East Broadway (Manhattan)|East Broadway]] on the [[Lower East Side]], designed by architect George Boehm and completed in 1912. It was a prime location, across the street from [[Seward Park (Manhattan)|Seward Park]]. The building was embellished with marble columns and panels and stained glass windows.

==Forward 50==
The "Forward 50" is a list of fifty Jewish-Americans "who have made a significant impact on the Jewish story in the past year", published annually as an editorial opinion of ''The Forward'' newspaper since 1994.&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/forward-50/ |title=Official Website |work=The Forward |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list was the initiative of [[Seth Lipsky]], founding editor of the English ''Forward''.&lt;ref name=f2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/forward-50-2009/#toppicks |title=2009 Forward 50 |publisher=Forward |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the magazine's website, this is not a scientific study, but rather the opinion of staff members, assisted by nominations from readers. ''The Forward'' does not endorse, or support any of the individuals mentioned in the listing. The rankings are divided into different categories (which may vary from year to year): Top Picks, Politics, Activism, Religion, Community, Culture, Philanthropy, Scandals, Sports and, new in 2010, Food.&lt;ref name=home/&gt;

The list also includes those Jews whose impact in the past year has been dramatic and damaging.&lt;ref name=f2009/&gt;

'''Thomas Bowen''' (1756–1827) was a Welsh Independent minister. He began work as a farm worker at an early age, but also attended lessons given by John Griffiths (1731–1811) of Glandŵr, which enabled him in 1777 to join [[Abergavenny]] Academy. His call to move to Maes-yr-Onnen in 1781 livened up the local church considerably. He then began extending his influence, preaching and establishing new churches in the Llansantffraid area.  After moving to Maes-yr-Haf chapel, [[Neath]], in 1795 he also established new churches in Melin-Cwrt and [[Aberavon]].

He died in February 1827.

In Japan, a {{nihongo|'''''tsukubai'''''|蹲踞}} is a washbasin provided at the entrance to holy places for visitors to purify themselves by the ritual washing of hands and rinsing of the mouth.&lt;ref name="MSIK"&gt;{{cite book | title=Must See in Kyoto | publisher=Japan Travel Bureau, Inc | year=1991 | location=Kyoto | pages=107 | isbn=4-533-00528-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of [[ritual purification|ritual cleansing]] is the custom for guests attending a [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]]&lt;ref name="MSIK"/&gt;  or visiting the grounds of a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[temple]].&lt;ref name="ZenKyoto133"&gt;{{cite book | title=Zen and Kyoto | publisher=Uniplan Co, Inc | author=Einarsen, John | year=2004 | location=Kyoto | pages=133 | isbn=4-89704-202-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name originates from the verb ''tsukubau'' meaning "to crouch"&lt;ref name="Setsuko"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/23738000 |title=Dictionary of Japanese Culture |last=Setsuko |first=Kojima |last2=Crane |first2=Gene A |date=1991 |publisher=Heian |isbn=0893463361 |edition= 1st American |location=Union City, CA |pages=369–70 |oclc=23738000}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "to bow down", an act of humility.&lt;ref name="ZenKyoto133"/&gt; Guests attending a tea ceremony crouch and wash their hands in a tsukubai set in the [[tea garden]] before entering the tearoom.&lt;ref name="Setsuko"/&gt;

Tsukubai are usually of stone, and are often provided with a small [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]], ready for use.&lt;ref name="Setsuko"/&gt;  A supply of water may be provided via a bamboo pipe&lt;ref name="Setsuko"/&gt; called a ''kakei''.

If each is read in combination with 口 (kuchi) - the shape of the central bowl - then the characters become 吾, 唯, 足, 知 which translates literally as "I only know plenty" (吾 = ware = I, 唯 = tada = only, 足 = taru = plenty, 知 = shiru = know).&lt;ref name="stonelantern"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stonelantern.ch/Frame_English/Zenibachi_English.htm | title=Tsukubai and Zenibachi, the Japanese Water Basins | accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying meaning, variously translated as "what one has is all one needs",&lt;ref name="stonelantern"/&gt; or "learn only to be content"&lt;ref name="ZenKyoto90-91"/&gt; reflects the basic anti-materialistic teachings of [[Buddhism]].

'''Ya`fūr''' (also variously rendered as Ya'foor, Ya'four, `Ufayr, `Ofayr and so on, meaning "Deer" in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) was a [[donkey]] used as a mount by the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], who was said to have often ridden it bareback. There are many tales of this donkey but the most common would be that the donkey is recorded to have been a gift from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] governor of [[Egypt]] some time between 628 and 632 AD (8–11 [[Hijri year|AH]]). According to an Islamic tradition,{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} it had the power of speech and told Muhammad that it was the last of a line of donkeys ridden by prophets and was a descendant of the donkey ridden by Jesus in his [[triumphal entry into Jerusalem]], which was also called Ya`fūr. The tradition holds that Ya`fūr committed suicide in despair after Muhammad died by throwing itself into a well, though these accounts are held to be unreliable in [[hadith studies]]. In the centuries after Muhammad's death, the donkey's name and symbolism was repeatedly adopted by Islamic religious figures and rulers.

==Gifting of Ya`fūr==

Ya`fūr was one of several animals that Muhammad rode; the others included a [[Roan (horse)|roan]] horse called ''Murtajaz'' ("Spontaneous"), a black horse called ''Sakb'' ("Swift"), a mule called ''[[Duldul (mule)|Duldul]]'' ("Vacillating") and a camel called ''Kaswa'' ("Split-Ears"), who accidentally killed herself when she hit her head on the stone wall of a [[mosque]] some time after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Path Of Muhammad: A Book On Islamic Morals And Ethics|author1=Birgivî Mehmet Efendi|author2=Imam Birgivi|author3=Tosun Bayrak|page=19|publisher=World Wisdom, Inc|year=2005|isbn=9780941532686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Book of Gifts and Rarities]]'' (''Kitab al-Hadaya wa'l-Tuhaf''), an anonymous 11th century work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise Of Islam|last=Gordon|first=Matthew|page=59|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2005|isbn=9780313325229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ya`fūr was presented to Muhammad by [[Muqawqis|al-Muqawqis]], the Byzantine governor of Egypt&lt;ref name="Gifts"&gt;{{cite book|title=Book of Gifts and Rarities|pages=63–4|author=Ghādah Hijjāwī Qaddūmī|publisher=Harvard CMES|year=1996|isbn=9780932885135}}&lt;/ref&gt; (possibly [[Cyrus of Alexandria]], the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Tale of Two Factions: Myth, Memory, and Identity in Ottoman Egypt and Yemen|last=Hathaway|first=Jane|page=168|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2003|isbn=9780791458846}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Muhammad had sent Muqawqis a letter inviting him to convert to [[Islam]]. In return, Muqawqis sent the donkey, the mule Duldul, four slave girls, a [[eunuch]], a horse, 1000 ''[[mithqal]]s'' of gold and quantities of Egyptian goods and articles. One of the slave girls, [[Maria al-Qibtiyya]], a [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christian]], was kept by Muhammad for himself and bore him a short-lived son, [[Ibrahim ibn Muhammad|Ibrahim]].&lt;ref name="Gifts" /&gt; The donkey was no mean gift either, as Egyptian donkeys were known for their beauty and were used by wealthy merchants as a means of transportation.&lt;ref name="Gifts253"&gt;''Book of Gifts and Rarities'', p. 253 fn. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ya`fūr in hadith==

[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -26- - Entry into Jerusalem2.jpg|left|thumb|According to an Islamic tradition, Jesus's donkey was an ancestor of Muhammad's donkey and both were named Ya`fūr]]
The donkey is the subject of a [[hadith]] (an account of the sayings and deeds of Muhammad) which holds that it had the power of speech{{cn|date=August 2018}}. According to one version, Muhammad asked the donkey what its name was, to which it replied "Yazīd bin Shihāb". He declined to call it this, instead giving it the name of Ya`fūr&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Canonical Ḥadīth|last=Juynboll|first=G.H.A.|page=41|publisher=BRILL|year=2007|isbn=9789004156746}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a name which, according to another Islamic tradition, was shared by the donkey ridden by [[Jesus]] during his triumphal entry into Jerusalem&lt;ref name="Gifts253" /&gt;). The donkey is said to have declined the gift of a female companion.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt; 

Another account holds that it was the donkey that spoke first to Muhammad, telling him that it had formerly been owned by a [[Jewish people|Jew]]. It had been uncooperative with its previous owner, deliberately stumbling so as to make him fall off, and was often punished by having its food withheld and being beaten. According to the donkey's own account, it was the last of sixty generations of donkeys which had been used by prophets (including Jesus, [[Ezra]] and [[Balaam]]) as riding animals.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt; The donkey was said to have told Muhammad that he was "the last of his lineage, for Muhammad was the last of the prophets, and that he had been waiting for him and had allowed no one else to mount him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Muhammad|last=Weinberger|first=Eliot|page=12|publisher=Verso|year=2006|isbn=9781844671182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad was also said to have used Ya`fūr as a messenger, sending it to fetch supplies from merchants at whose doors it knocked using its head. The donkey would give the merchant a token telling him to love or to respond to the Prophet of God. When Muhammad died, the grief-stricken donkey was said to have committed suicide by throwing itself down the well of Abū 'l-Haytham bin at-Tayyihān.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt;

An alternative hadith transmitted in [[Syria]] holds that Ya`fūr's colour was black rather than sandy, that its previous name was 'Amr rather than Yazīd or Ziyād, and that it was the last of seven siblings ridden by prophets, rather than being the last of a line of sixty donkeys.&lt;ref name="Bashir"&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Early Islamic Tradition|last=Bashīr|first=Sulaymān|page=64|publisher=JSAI|year=2004|isbn=9789657258019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These accounts, however, are regarded in hadith studies as being untruthful and their chain of attribution or ''isnād'' is seen as dubious. The 12th century historian [[Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi]] is quoted as saying, "May God curse the fabricator of this tradition!"&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt; [[Ibn Hibban]] considered it weak on the grounds of the source, [[Muhammad bin Mazyad]], being unreliable.&lt;ref name="Bashir" /&gt;

==Political and religious legacy of Ya`fūr==
[[File:Gustav Jaeger Bileam Engel.jpg|right|thumb|Balaam meets an angel, which only his donkey can see]]
Followers of [[Shia Islam]] believed that the [[Mahdi]], the prophesied redeemer of Islam, would make his appearance in the company of Ya`fūr the donkey and Duldul the mule. In one uprising, a grey mule representing Duldul was paraded with a chair on its back for the Mahdi. In the lands where [[Sunni Islam]] was practised, Ya`fūr was repeatedly invoked in political and religious events for centuries after Muhammad's death. A "false prophet" active in [[Yemen]] in the 7th century usurped one of Muhammad's own epithets, calling himself (or being called) the ''Sahib al-Himar'', the "Master of the Ass". Likewise the 8th century [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]] [[Marwan II]] was nicknamed ''al-Himar'', "the Ass". The early [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was nearly overthrown in the 10th century by the rebel [[Abu Yazid]], known as the "Man on the Donkey", while in [[Morocco]] the 12th century founder of the [[Almohad]] movement, [[Ibn Tumart]], insisted on riding a donkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hunters, Herders, and Hamburgers: The Past and Future of Human-Animal Relationships|last=Bulliet|first=Richard W.|pages=156–7|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780231130776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wider context, the story of Muhammad's donkey can be seen in the light of such animals being seen as religiously significant in the Near and Middle East for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunters, Herders, and Hamburgers'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Donkeys and asses were held by the ancient [[Israelite]]s to have a special connection with the spirit world. This is illustrated in the story of [[Balaam]] and the angel in the [[Book of Numbers]], in which the prophet's donkey sees an otherwise invisible angel and miraculously gains the power of speech.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunters, Herders, and Hamburgers'', p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samson]], too, draws on the mystical power of the donkey by using an ass's jawbone – symbolic of the power of the donkey's voice – to slay a thousand [[Philistines]], while asses and donkeys were integral to the stories of Jesus and [[David]].&lt;ref name="Hunters156"&gt;''Hunters, Herders, and Hamburgers'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; 

A traditional connection between prophets and donkeys also existed in pre-Islamic [[Arabia]], where seers (known as ''kahins'') were often associated with asses.&lt;ref name="Hunters156" /&gt; Muhammad's arrival was said to have been prophesied by a Jew who spoke of "a man neither short nor tall, wrapped in a cloak, and riding an ass."&lt;ref&gt;''Hunters, Herders, and Hamburgers'', p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; The evil anti-Messiah [[Masih ad-Dajjal|al-Dajjal]] is also expected to appear on a giant white donkey, while Muhammad himself is widely reported to have warned of the infernal nature of a donkey's voice: "When you hear the bray of an ass, seek refuge with God from the devil."&lt;ref&gt;''Hunters, Herders, and Hamburgers'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yama Zatdaw''' ({{lang-my|ရာမဇာတ်တော်}}, {{IPA-my|jàma̰ zaʔ tɔ̀|pron}}), unofficially [[Myanmar|Myanmar's]] national epic, is the [[Burmese language|Burmese]] version of the [[Ramayana]]. There are nine known pieces of the Yama Zatdaw in Myanmar. The Burmese name for the story itself is ''Yamayana'', while ''zatdaw'' refers to the acted play or being part of [[jataka tales]] of [[Theravada Buddhism]].

The Yama Zatdaw was introduced by oral tradition during [[Anawratha|King Anawratha's]] reign although it was not known clearly whether the story was Valmiki’s Sanskrit epic Ramayana or not. In the [[Nathlaung Temple]], the [[Visnu]] temple, within the walls of old city [[Bagan]], there are some stone sculptures, one of which is [[Ramachandra]]. Based on Burmese literature, at least, [[Hanuman]] has been known in Burma definitely before 1527 AD.

The Burmese Ramayana was influenced greatly by [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], during which various [[Konbaung Dynasty]] kings invaded the kingdom. The invasions often brought back spoils of war, including elements of [[Ramakien]] (Thai version of Ramayana) into the epic. Rama sā-khyan, one of the well known literature in Burma, is believed to be composed in 1775 by U Aung Phyo which begins with [[Bala kanda]] and ends at [[Ramayana#Yuddha Kanda|Yudha kanda]] as in [[Valmiki]]'s Ramayana. There are also important Burmese literature and classical music related to the Ramayana which were developed in that era such as [[U Toe]]'s ''Yama yakan'' (Rama's song, {{my|ရာမရကန်}} and ''Thida yakan'' (Sita's song, {{my|သီတာရကန်}}), both written in 1784; ''Yama pyazat'' (Ramayana ballet, {{my|ရာမပြဇာတ်}}) in 1789; and ''Kalay Yama wuthtu'' (Young Rama's life, {{my|ကလေးရာမဝတ္ထု}}) in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090120072853/http://borobudurpark.co.id/en-ramayana.html "Ramayana, the old ancient wonder of the world was one center of a romantic powerful empire"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Mon people|ethnic Mon]] adaptation of Ramayana is known as "Loik Samoing Ram" which was written in 1834 AD by a Buddhist monk named Uttama. It is evident that "Loik Samoing Ram" is mainly derived from Burmese version as the author of the Mon version stated in his preface that due to the popularity of Burmese version in the capital. However, Mon version also exhibits the connections with Thai, Javanese and Malayan versions and has own unique episodes, not found in Thai, Burmese or Malayan versions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cseas.kyoto-u.ac.jp/seas/34/2/340202.pdf "Salient features of Mon Rama story" by [[Toru Ohno]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
The characters of Yama Zatdaw share the same features and characteristics as those in the original story. However, in acting, the costumes are a mixture of [[Bamar]] and [[Thailand|Thai]] elements. The names of the characters, in general, are Burmese transliterations of the Sanskrit names. 

*[[Rama]] is known as Yama ({{my|ရာမ}}).
*[[Sita]] is known as Thida ({{my|မယ်သီတာ}}).
