'''''Amaranthus''''', collectively known as '''amaranth''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Amaranthaceae {{!}} plant family |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/18481/Amaranthaceae#ref230955 |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=2015-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] [[genus]] of [[annual plant|annual]] or short-lived [[perennial plant]]s. Some amaranth species are cultivated as [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[pseudocereal]]s, and [[ornamental plant]]s. Most of the ''Amaranthus'' species are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as [[pigweed]].&lt;ref name="Bensch"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bensch |display-authors=etal |year=2003 |title=Interference of redroot pigweed (''Amaranthus retroflexus''), Palmer amaranth (''A. palmeri''), and common waterhemp (''A. rudis'') in soybean |journal=Weed Science |volume=51 |page=37–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catkin]]-like [[cyme (botany)|cymes]] of densely packed flowers grow in summer or autumn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=RHS A–Z encyclopedia of garden plants |year=2008 |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |isbn=1405332964 |pages=1136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 60 [[species]] are recognized, with [[inflorescence]]s and foliage ranging from purple, through red and green to gold. Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus ''[[Celosia]]''.

"Amaranth" derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀμάραντος}}&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)ma/rantos|ἀμάραντος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang|grc-Latn|amárantos}}), "unfading", with the Greek word for "flower", {{lang|grc|ἄνθος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|ánthos}}), factoring into the word's development as ''amaranth''. ''Amarant'' is an archaic variant.

''Amaranthus'' shows a wide variety of morphological diversity among and even within certain species. Although the family ([[Amaranthaceae]]) is distinctive, the [[genus]] has few distinguishing characters among the 70 species included.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8339.2007.00665.x | author = Juan | year = 2007 | title = Electrophoretic characterization of ''Amaranthus'' L. seed proteins and its systematic implication | url = | journal = Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 155 | issue = | pages = 57–63 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This complicates [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and ''Amaranthus'' has generally been considered among systematists as a "difficult" genus.&lt;ref name = "Costea"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3088717 | author = Costea M, DeMason D | year = 2001 | title = Stem morphology and anatomy in Amaranthus L.

Formerly, Sauer (1955) classified the genus into two subgenera, differentiating only between [[Plant sexual morphology#Individual plant morphology|monoecious]] and [[Plant sexual morphology#Individual plant morphology|dioecious]] species: ''Acnida'' (L.) Aellen ex K.R. Robertson and ''Amaranthus''.&lt;ref name="Costea" /&gt; Although this classification was widely accepted, further infrageneric classification was (and still is) needed to differentiate this widely diverse group.

Currently, ''Amaranthus'' includes three recognized subgenera and 70 species, although species numbers are questionable due to [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and species concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Judd et al. (2008). ''Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach'', Third Edition. Sinauer Associates, Inc. Sunderland, MA&lt;/ref&gt; Infrageneric classification focuses on inflorescence, flower characters and whether a species is monoecious/dioecious, as in the Sauer (1955) suggested classification.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; A modified infrageneric classification of ''Amaranthus'' was published by Mosyakin &amp; Robertson (1996) and includes three subgenera: ''Acnida'', ''Amaranthus'', and ''Albersia''. The taxonomy is further differentiated by sections within each of the subgenera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mosyakin &amp; Robertson |year=1996 |title=New infrageneric taxa and combinations in ''Amaranthus'' (Amaranthaceae) |journal=Ann.

== Human uses ==

=== History ===
Known to the [[Aztecs]] as {{lang|nci|huāuhtli}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Coe, S.D.|year=1994|title=America's First Cuisines|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292711594|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guKnUdrLhtYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; amaranth is thought to have represented up to 80% of their energy consumption before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]]. Another important use of amaranth throughout [[Mesoamerica]] was to prepare ritual drinks and foods. To this day, [[amaranth grain]]s are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with [[honey]], [[molasses]], or [[chocolate]] to make a treat called {{lang|es|alegría}}, meaning "joy" in Spanish. [[Diego Durán]] described the festivities for {{lang|nci|[[Huitzilopochtli]]|italic=no}}, the name of which means "left side of the hummingbird" or "hummingbird left-hand" (Real hummingbirds feed on amaranth flowers). The Aztec month of {{lang|nci|[[Aztec calendar|Panquetzaliztli]]|italic=no}} (7 December to 26 December) was dedicated to {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli|italic=no}}.  People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally [[human sacrifice]]s were held. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a little piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas celebration.

Because of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, its palatability, ease of cooking, and a protein that is particularly well-suited to human nutritional needs, interest in grain amaranth (especially ''A. cruentus'' and ''A. hypochondriacus'') revived in the 1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated. It is a popular snack sold in Mexico, sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice, and its use has spread to Europe and parts of North America.  Amaranth and [[quinoa]] are not grasses and are called [[pseudocereal]]s because of their similarities to cereals in flavor and cooking.

=== Seed ===
Several species are raised for amaranth [[pseudograin|"grain"]] in Asia and the Americas.

Ancient amaranth grains still used include the three species, ''[[Amaranthus caudatus]]'', ''[[Amaranthus cruentus]]'', and ''[[Amaranthus hypochondriacus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Costea et al. (2006). Delimitation of ''A. cruentus'' L. and ''A. caudatus'' L. using micromorphology and AFLP analysis: an application in germplasm identification. Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution 53: 1625-1633.&lt;/ref&gt; Although amaranth was cultivated on a large scale in ancient Mexico, Guatemala, and Peru, nowadays it is only cultivated on a small scale there, along with India, China, Nepal, and other tropical countries; thus, the potential exists for further cultivation in those countries, as well as in the U.S. In a 1977 article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', amaranth was described as "the crop of the future".&lt;ref&gt;Marx (1977). Speaking of Science: Amaranth: A Comeback for the Food of the Aztecs? Science 198(4312): 40.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed as an inexpensive native crop that could be cultivated by indigenous people in rural areas for several reasons:
* It is easily harvested.
* Its seeds are a good source of protein.&lt;ref name=mpoll&gt;De Macvean &amp; Pöll (1997). Chapter 8: Ethnobotany. Tropical Tree Seed Manual, USDA Forest Service, edt. J.A Vozzo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tucker/&gt;
* In cooked and edible forms, amaranth retains adequate content of several [[dietary minerals]].&lt;ref name=usdamrth&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA National Nutrient Database: cooked amaranth grain per 100 grams; Full report |url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/6474?fg=&amp;man=&amp;lfacet=&amp;count=&amp;max=&amp;sort=&amp;qlookup=&amp;offset=&amp;format=Full&amp;new=&amp;measureby=|date=2014|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is easy to cook.
* As befits its weedy life history, amaranth grains grow rapidly and, in three cultivated species of amaranth, their large seedheads can weigh up to 1&amp;nbsp;kg and contain a half-million small seeds.&lt;ref name = "Tucker"&gt;Tucker, J. (1986). Amaranth: the once and future crop. Bioscience 36(1): 9-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--original research === Seed flour ===

Amaranth seed flour has been evaluated as an additive to wheat flour by food specialists. To determine palatability, different levels of amaranth grain flour were mixed with the wheat flour and baking ingredients (1% salt, 2.5% fat, 1.5% yeast, 10% sugar, and 52–74% water), fermented, molded, pan-proofed, and baked. The baked products were evaluated for loaf volume, moisture content, color, odor, taste, and texture. The amaranth-containing products were then compared with bread made from 100% wheat flour. The loaf volume decreased by 40% and the moisture content increased from 22 to 42% with increase in amaranth grain flour. The study found that the sensory scores of the taste, odor, color, and texture decreased with increasing amounts of amaranth. Generally, above 15% amaranth grain flour, significant differences occurred in the evaluated sensory qualities and the high amaranth-containing product was found to be of unacceptable palatability to the population sample that evaluated the baked products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The effect of amaranth grain flour on the quality of bread|author=Jerome Ayo|doi=10.1081/JFP-100105198|journal=International Journal of Food Properties|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|pages=341|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/JFP-100105198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaves, roots, and stems ===

Amaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a [[leaf vegetable]] in many parts of the world. Four species of ''Amaranthus'' are documented as cultivated vegetables in eastern Asia: ''[[Amaranthus cruentus]]'', ''[[Amaranthus blitum]], [[Amaranthus dubius]]'', and ''[[Amaranthus tricolor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Costea (2003). Notes on Economic Plants. ''Economic Botany'' 57(4): 646-649&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia and Malaysia, leaf amaranth is called {{lang|id|bayam}}. In the Philippines, the [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] word for the plant is {{lang|ilo|kalunay}}; the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for the plant is {{lang|tg|kilitis}} or {{lang|tg|kulitis}}. In [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]] in India, it is called ''chaulai'' and is a popular green leafy vegetable (referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called ''[[saag]]''). It is called ''chua'' in Kumaun area of Uttarakhand, where it is a popular red-green vegetable. In Karnataka in India, it is called ''harive''. It is used to prepare curries such as ''hulee, palya, majjigay-hulee'', and so on. In Kerala, it is called ''cheera'' and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chillies to make ''cheera [[thoran]]''. In Tamil Nadu, it is called ''mulaikkira'' and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed, and mashed, with light seasoning of salt, red chili, and cumin. It is  called ''keerai masial''.  In ''Andhra Pradesh'', this leaf is added in preparation of a popular ''[[dal]]'' called {{lang|te|thotakura pappu}} in ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]). In Maharashtra, it is called ''shravani maath'' and is available in both red and white colour. In Orissa, it is called ''khada saga'', it is used to prepare ''saga bhaja'', in which the leaf is fried with chili and onions.

In China, the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable, or in soups. In Vietnam, it is called {{lang|vi|rau dền}} and is used to make [[soup]]. Two species are popular as edible vegetable in Vietnam: {{lang|vi|dền đỏ}} (''Amaranthus tricolor'') and {{lang|vi|dền cơm}} or {{lang|vi|dền trắng}} (''Amaranthus viridis'').

A traditional food plant in Africa, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost [[food security]], foster rural development and support sustainable land care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink= |author=National Research Council |others= |title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume II: Vegetables |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763 |format= |accessdate=2008-07-15 |edition= |series=Lost Crops of Africa |volume=2 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=National Academies Press |location= |isbn=978-0-309-10333-6 |oclc=34344933 |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter=Amaranth |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763&amp;page=35 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] as {{lang|yo|shoko}} a short form of {{lang|yo|shokoyokoto}} (meaning make the husband fat) or {{lang|yo|arowo jeja}} (meaning "we have money left over for fish"). In the Caribbean, the leaves are called ''bhaji'' in Trinidad and ''callaloo'' in Jamaica, and are sautéed with onions, garlic, and tomatoes, or sometimes used in a soup called pepperpot soup. In Botswana, it is referred to as ''morug'' and cooked as a staple green vegetable.

In Greece, green amaranth (''A. viridis'') is a popular dish called {{lang|el|βλήτα}}, {{lang|el-Latn|vlita}} or {{lang|el-Latn|vleeta}}. It is boiled, then served with olive oil and lemon juice like a salad, sometimes alongside fried fish. Greeks stop harvesting the plant (which also grows wild) when it starts to bloom at the end of August.

In Brazil, green amaranth was, and to a degree still is, frequently regarded as an invasive species as all other species of amaranth (except the generally imported ''A. caudatus'' cultivar), though some have traditionally appreciated it as a leaf vegetable, under the names of {{lang|pt|caruru}} or {{lang|pt|bredo}}, which is consumed cooked, generally accompanying the staple food, [[rice and beans]].

=== Dyes ===

The flowers of the 'Hopi Red Dye' amaranth were used by the [[Hopi]] (a tribe in the western United States) as the source of a deep red [[natural dye|dye]].  Also a synthetic dye was named "[[Amaranth (dye)|amaranth]]" for its similarity in color to the natural amaranth [[pigment]]s known as [[betalain]]s. This synthetic dye is also known as Red No. 2 in North America and E123 in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;"The following color additives are not authorized for use in food products in the United States: (1) Amaranth (C.I. 16185, EEC No. E123, formerly certifiable as FD&amp;C red No. 2);" [http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~comm/cp03803.html FDA/CFSAN Food Compliance Program: Domestic Food Safety Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110929/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~comm/cp03803.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ornamentals ===
[[File:Amaranthus flowers.jpg|thumb|Amaranthus flowering]]
The genus also contains several well-known ornamental plants, such as ''Amaranthus caudatus'' (love-lies-bleeding), a vigorous, hardy annual with dark purplish [[flower]]s crowded in handsome drooping spikes. Another Indian annual, ''A. hypochondriacus'' (prince's feather), has deeply veined, lance-shaped leaves, purple on the under face, and deep crimson flowers densely packed on erect spikes.

Amaranths are recorded as food plants for some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species including the [[Nutmeg (moth)|nutmeg moth]] and various case-bearer moths of the genus ''[[Coleophora]]'': ''C. amaranthella'', ''C. enchorda'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. immortalis'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. lineapulvella'', and ''C. versurella'' (recorded on ''A. spinosus'').

== Ecology ==

Amaranth weed species have an extended period of germination, rapid growth, and high rates of seed production,&lt;ref name = "Bensch"/&gt; and have been causing problems for farmers since the mid-1990s. This is partially due to the reduction in [[tillage]], reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species where herbicides have been applied more often.&lt;ref&gt;Wetzel et al. (1999). Use of PCR-based molecular markers to identify weedy Amaranthus species. Weed Science 47: 518-523.&lt;/ref&gt; The following 9 species of ''Amaranthus'' are considered invasive and noxious weeds in the U.S and Canada: [[Amaranthus albus|''A. albus'']], [[Amaranthus blitoides|''A. blitoides'']], [[Amaranthus hybridus|''A. hybridus'']], [[Amaranthus palmeri|''A. palmeri'']], [[Amaranthus powellii|''A. powellii'']], [[Amaranthus retroflexus|''A. retroflexus'']], [[Amaranthus spinosus|''A. spinosus'']], [[Amaranthus tuberculatus|''A. tuberculatus'']], and [[Amaranthus viridis|''A. viridis'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=AMARA USDA Plant Database. Plants Profile- ''Amaranthus'' L]&lt;/ref&gt;

A new herbicide-resistant strain of ''[[Amaranthus palmeri]]'' has appeared; it is [[glyphosate]]-resistant and so cannot be killed by herbicides using the chemical. Also, this plant can survive in tough conditions. The species ''Amaranthus palmeri'' (Palmer amaranth) causes the greatest reduction in [[soybean]] yields and has the potential to reduce yields by 17-68% in field experiments.&lt;ref name = "Bensch"/&gt; Palmer amaranth is among the "top five most troublesome weeds" in the southeast of the United States and has already evolved resistances to [[dinitroaniline]] herbicides and [[acetolactate synthase inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Culpepper et al. (2006). Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (''Amaranthus palmeri'') confirmed in Georgia. Weed Science 54: 620-626.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the proper identification of ''Amaranthus'' species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists. Proper weed control needs to be applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions.

An evolutionary lineage of around 90 species within the genus has acquired the [[C4 carbon fixation|{{C4}} carbon fixation]] pathway, which increases their photosynthetic efficiency. This probably occurred in the [[Miocene]].&lt;ref name="Sage2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sage |first=R.F. |year=2016 |title=A portrait of the {{C4}} photosynthetic family on the 50th anniversary of its discovery: species number, evolutionary lineages, and Hall of Fame |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=67 |issue=14 |pages=4039–4056 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erw156 |issn=0022-0957 |pmid=27053721}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SageSage2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sage |first1=R.F. |last2=Sage |first2=T.L. |last3=Pearcy |first3=R.W. |last4=Borsch |first4=T. |title=The taxonomic distribution of {{C4}} photosynthesis in Amaranthaceae sensu stricto|journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=94 |issue=12 |year=2007 |pages=1992–2003 |issn=0002-9122 |doi=10.3732/ajb.94.12.1992}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrea Rossi''' (born 3 June 1950) is an Italian entrepreneur who claims to have invented a [[cold fusion]] device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =Mark Gibbs |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2011/10/17/hello-cheap-energy-hello-brave-new-world |title=Hello Cheap Energy, Hello Brave New World |publisher=Forbes |date= 2011-10-17|accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/22/e_cat_test_claims_success_yet_again/ Richard Chirgwin, [[The Register]]: "Italian entrepreneur Andrea Rossi"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/tecnologie/2011-10-13/fusione-fredda-sfida-continua-210440.shtml?uuid=AaIpikCE Paolo Magliocco, [[Il Sole 24 Ore]],&lt;br&gt;"Fusione fredda: la sfida continua. L'esperimento dell'imprenditore Andrea Rossi".&lt;br&gt;TRANSLATION:&lt;br&gt;"Cold fusion: the challenge continues. The experiment performed by entrepreneur Andrea Rossi"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Rossi claimed to have invented a process to convert organic waste into petroleum, and in 1978 he founded a company named Petroldragon to process waste. In the 1989 the company was shut down by the Italian government amid allegations of fraud, and Rossi was arrested.&lt;ref name="la Reppublica 1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New Energy Times"/&gt; In 1996 Rossi moved to the United States and from 2001 to 2003 he worked under a U.S. Army contract to make a thermoelectric device that, while promising to be superior to other devices, produced only around 1/1000 of the claimed performance.&lt;ref name="US Army 2004"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA432046 |title=Application of Thermoelectric Devices to Fuel Cell Power Generation: Demonstration and Evaluation |first1=John |last1=Huston |first2=Chris |last2=Wyatt |first3=Chris |last3=Nichols |first4=Michael J. |last4=Binder |first5=Franklin H. |last5=Holcomb |date=September 2004 |publisher=Construction Engineering Research Laboratory of the [[Engineer Research and Development Center]] |location=[[Champaign, Illinois]]}} ([http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ada432046&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf online pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.popsci.com/article/science/dubious-cold-fusion-machine-acquired-north-carolina-company |title=Dubious Cold Fusion Machine Acquired By North Carolina Company |work=[[Popular Science]] |first=Douglas |last=Main |date=25 January 2014 |access-date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Rossi attempted to patent a device called an [[Energy Catalyzer]] (or E-Cat), which is a purported [[cold fusion]] or Low-Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR) thermal power source.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Intellectual Property Organization]] publication number [http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/search/en/WO2009125444 WO/2009/125444.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ritter |first=Stephen K. |title=Cold Fusion Lives: Experiments Create Energy When None Should Exist |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cold-fusion-lives-experiments-create-energy-when-none-should-exist1/ |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=28 November 2016 |access-date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rossi claims that the device produces massive amounts of excess heat that can be used to produce electricity, but independent attempts to reproduce the effect have failed.

==Business ventures==

===Petroldragon===
In 1974, Rossi registered a patent for an incineration system. In 1978, he wrote ''The Incineration of Waste and River Purification'', published in Milan by [[Tecniche Nuove]].
He then founded Petroldragon, a company that was paid to process toxic waste, claiming to use Rossi's process to convert the waste into usable petroleum products.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1989 Italian customs seized several Petroldragon waste deposit sites and assets. Investigations showed that petroleum presumably produced by the company was never been placed on the market, and that mixtures of toxic waste and harmful chemical solvents were being stored in silos or illegally dumped into the environment.&lt;ref name="la Reppublica 1989"&gt;{{cite news|URL=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1989/07/26/storia-di-rifiuti-tossici-miliardi-supertruffe.html |title= Storia di rifiuti tossici miliardi supertruffe |work=la Repubblica |trans-title=Story of Milan Toxic Waste Super-scam|date=26 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url= http://legislature.camera.it/_dati/leg12/lavori/Bollet/40429_09.pdf |work=COMMISSIONE PARLAMENTARE DI INCHIESTA |title=sul ciclo dei rifiuti e sulle attività illecite ad esso connesse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Edoardo Bai of Italy's [[Legambiente]] environmental association, "Rossi basically took a series of old and misused refineries where there are big containers, huge storage containers and stocked the waste collected in all these old refineries, he gathered [from] all around Italy, the largest one was the one of Lacchiarelli and he left the waste there without treating it." {{citation|url=http://newenergytimes.com/v2/sr/RossiECat/RaiNews-TV-TheMagicofMrRossi.shtml | title=The Magic of Mr. Rossi - Selected Excerpts from May 5, 2011, Rai News 24 -TV, Italy |publisher=New Energy Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rossi himself was arrested and eventually tried on 56 counts, 5 of which ended in convictions related to tax fraud.

He persuaded technicians of the field, scientists and important institutions, [inaudible] the region of Lombardia that he was able to do magic."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electricity from waste heat===
In the US Rossi started the consulting firm Leonardo Technologies, Inc. (LTI). He secured a defense contract to evaluate the potential of generating electricity from [[waste heat]] by using [[thermoelectric generator]]s. Such devices are normally only used for heating or cooling ([[Peltier effect]]), because the efficiency for generating  electrical power is only a few percent. Rossi suggested that his devices could attain 20% efficiency. Larger modules would be manufactured in Italy. Rossi sent 27 thermoelectric devices for evaluation to the [[Engineer Research and Development Center]]; 19 of these did not produce any electricity at all. The remaining units produced less than 1 watt each, instead of the expected 800–1000 watts.&lt;ref name="USArmy2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Huston |author2=Chris Wyatt |author3=Chris Nichols |author4=Michael J.

The '''BC Oil and Gas Commission''' is a [[Crown Corporation]] of the province of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], established in 1998. Its mandate is to regulate oil and gas activities and pipelines in British Columbia. Their mandate does not extend to regulating consumer gas prices at the pump.

==Overview==
The Oil and Gas Commission (OGC) was created and defined under the 1998 ''Oil and Gas Commission Act'' by and for the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=OGCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil and Gas Commission Act|url=http://faolex.fao.org/docs/html/bc80181.htm|publisher=Queen's Printer, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The OGC is a [[crown corporation]] acting as "an agent of the [provincial] government", where the [[Minister of Finance]] is its fiscal agent. It is headed by 3 directors.The overall employees that are working would be 659. The deputy minister is a director and the chair of the OGC, and the [[Lieutenant Governor in Council]] may appoint 2 directors, for a term not longer than 5 years, one of whom is the commissioner and vice chair of the commission.&lt;ref name=OGCA/&gt;

===Purpose===
The OGCs purposes are to

(a) regulate [[fossil fuel]] activities, i.e. the [[petroleum industry]], which includes but is not limited to [[petroleum licensing]], regulating [[hydrocarbon exploration]], [[oil and gas well drilling]], [[shale oil extraction]], [[natural gas processing]], [[oil pipeline]] in British Columbia in a manner that
*  "provides for the sound development of the oil and gas sector, by fostering a [[healthy environment]], a sound [[economy]] and social [[health|well being]],"
* "[[Conservation (ethic)|conserves]] oil and gas resources in British Columbia",
* "ensures safe and [[efficiency|efficient]] practices, and"
* "assists owners of oil and gas resources to participate equitably in the production of shared pools of oil and gas,"
(b)" provide for [[effective]] and efficient processes for the review of applications related to oil and gas activities or pipelines, and to ensure that applications that are approved are in the public interest having regard to environmental, economic and social effects",

(c) "encourage the participation of [[First Nations]] and aboriginal peoples in processes affecting them",

(d) "participate in planning processes", and

(e) "undertake programs of education and communication in order to advance safe and efficient practices and the other purposes of the commission."&lt;ref name=OGCA/&gt;

===Tools===
The OGC issues various authorizations under the ''Petroleum and Natural Gas Act'' and the ''Pipeline Act,'' including a "general development permit" which is "an approval in principle for oil and gas activities and pipelines in an area of British Columbia".&lt;ref name=OGCA/&gt;

The OGC is a [[Single-window system|single window regulator]]&lt;ref name=Van213&gt;{{cite news|author1=Gordon Hoekstra|title=B.C. Oil and Gas Commission lacks 'transparency' on fracking violations|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Commission+lacks+transparency+fracking+violations/7982077/story.html#ixzz2LJxOTr2b|accessdate=4 February 2015|work=Vancouver Sun|publisher=Postmedia Network Inc|date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It handles applications and at the same checks the [[regulatory compliance|compliance]] and enforces its regulations with penalties for violations.

The OGC has offices in four cities: [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]], [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]], [[Kelowna]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]].

===Compliance and enforcement information===
In 2010-11, the OGC "issued 15 penalty tickets with fines of $575 (the maximum allowed for tickets) or less, which included unlawful water withdrawals and failure to promptly report a spill. Court prosecutions included a $20,000 fine for a Water Act stream violation, $10,575 for another stream violation and $250,0000 for a sour gas release. [...] The commission would not release the names of the companies convicted".&lt;ref name=Van213/&gt;
Per the OGC, in 2O12, of "more than 800 deficiencies, 80 resulted in charges, largely under the provincial Water Act for the non-reporting of water volumes and a smaller portion under the provincial Environment Management Act. Another 13 resulted in orders under the provincial Oil and Gas Activities Act, 22 in warnings, 76 in letters requiring action and three in referrals to other agencies".&lt;ref name=Van213/&gt;
Paul Jeakins, OGC commissioner and CEO, has publicly acknowledged that OGC inspection and enforcement reports are "a bit of a gap".&lt;ref name=Van213/&gt;

==Lawsuits==
In November 2013, [[Ecojustice]], the [[Sierra Club]] and the [[Wilderness Committee]] filed a lawsuit against the OGC and [[Encana]] about Encana's water use from lakes and rivers for its [[hydraulic fracturing]] for shale gas, "granted by repeated short-term water permits, a violation of the provincial water act".&lt;ref name=H2013&gt;{{cite news|author1=Dene Moore|title=Fracking Lawsuit Targets EnCana, B.C. Oil And Gas Commission|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/11/13/fracking-lawsuit-encana_n_4268728.html|accessdate=1 August 2014|work=Canadian Press|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the OGC had granted Encana access to 20.4 million cubic metres of surface water, 7 million of which were for fracking and 54% of that were through short-term approvals.&lt;ref name=globe1014&gt;{{cite news|author1=Dene Moore|title=B.C.'s Supreme Court dismisses Water Act challenge to fracking operations|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/bcs-top-court-dismisses-water-act-challenge-to-fracking-operations/article21131524/|accessdate=4 February 2015|work=The Globe and Mail|publisher=Phillip Crawley|date= 16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014 the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] found no violation and dismissed the case.&lt;ref name=globe1014/&gt;

==Criticism==
The agency has been criticized to be "too industry-friendly", to have "vague regulations" and to issue non transparent fracking violation reports, for example by not naming convicted companies. The B.C. Ministry of Environment and other B.C. [[Crown corporations of Canada#British Columbia|Crown corporations of B.C.]] like [[WorkSafeBC]] have reported company names and details of those penalties for years. OGC reports prior to 2011 were available on the OGC website, but for 2012 they had to be requested.&lt;ref name=Van213/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2742">'''Bauernroulette''' is a [[game]] that was apparently invented in [[Germany]], where several companies sell it.  The name Bauernroulette indicates it is a "poor man's roulette", since Bauer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dict.cc/?s=bauer Translation of 'Bauer']: dict.cc&lt;/ref&gt; is German for 'peasant', 'farmer' or 'one of a chiefly European class of agricultural laborers'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.free-dictionary-translation.com/peasant.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Bauernroulette, a [[spinning top]] is spun in the middle of a [[wood|wooden]] circular playing surface that contains 6 wooden balls.  The balls bounce off the top in random directions, and sometimes land within one of several hollow indentations within the surface, or pass through a small hole into chambers that are located outside the spinning surface area.  Typically, the most points are scored by landing balls within these outer chambers.  Skilled players are often able to spin the top such that it remains in motion for more than 30 seconds.

[[Image:Bauernroulette.jpg|300px|thumb|An image of an older version of the game, the new one (available on the internet) is octagonal in shape, with eight 'bowls' instead of four on the outside.]]

== Rules ==
# Place the 6 balls (4 white, 1 red, and 1 green) in the center of the playing field.
# Set the whipping top near them and spin it.
# The balls will be shot into the small hollows or bowls.
# Each hollow or bowl in which the balls come to rest have a point value associated with them.  Add up the points of each of the hollows in which a ball has come to rest.
# If the red ball is in a hollow, double the number of points for that ball.
# If the green ball is in a hollow, the points are subtracted from the sum obtained by the other 5 balls.
# Sometimes balls will fly out of the playing surface.  These balls are out for that round and can not be replaced while the top is still spinning.
# A player scoring with all 6 balls gets to spin the top again.
# The winner is the player who first reaches a point total that is agreed upon before the game.  Normally this total is 1000 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://casinoobserver.com/bauernroulette.htm CasinoObserver - Bauernroulette]. Retrieved 2013-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative rule ===
The players can also stipulate that the score reached by the green and white balls is only valid if the red one also scores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interroulette.co.uk/baurnroulette.html Interroulette.co.uk - Bauernroulette] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507131506/http://www.interroulette.co.uk/baurnroulette.html |date=May 7, 2013 }}.

'''''Being Caribou''''' is a 2005 documentary film that chronicles the travels of husband and wife Karsten Heuer and Leanne Allison following the migration of the [[Porcupine caribou]] Herd, in order to explore the [[Arctic Refuge drilling controversy]].  The journey lasted 5 months, starting from the community of [[Old Crow, Yukon]] on April 8, 2003 and ending September 8, 2003. The film is produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]].

Karsten Heuer documented this trek with Leanne Allison, which was also their honeymoon, in his book "Being Caribou: Five Months on Foot with an Arctic Herd".  The book was published in 2005.

==Plot==
Allison, an [[environmentalist]], and Heuer, a [[wildlife biologist]], follow a herd of 120,000 caribou on foot, across 1,500 kilometres (900 Miles) of [[Arctic]] [[tundra]], in order to raise awareness of threats to the caribou's survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''boiling chip''', '''boiling stone''',  '''porous bits ''' or '''anti-bumping granule''' is a tiny, unevenly shaped piece of substance added to liquids to make them [[boiling|boil]] more calmly. Boiling chips are frequently employed in [[distillation]] and heating. When a liquid becomes [[superheating|superheated]], a particle of dust or a [[stirring rod]] can cause violent [[flash boiling]].  Boiling chips work by providing [[nucleation]] sites so the liquid boils smoothly without becoming [[superheating|superheated]] or [[Bumping (chemistry)|bumping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heartmagic.com/zzBoilingPoints.html |title=Boiling Points |publisher=Heartmagic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/50168894/Boiling-chips |title=Boiling chips |publisher=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==

Boiling chips should not be added to liquid that is already near its [[boiling point]], as this could also induce flash boiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blurtit.com/q803268.html |title=What Is The Use Of Boiling Chips In The Distillation Process? |publisher=Blurtit.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of a boiling chip traps liquid while in use, meaning that they cannot be re-used in laboratory setups. They also don't work well under vacuum; if a solution is boiling under vacuum, it's best to constantly stir it instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = LabManager |title = 3 Limitations of Using Boiling Chips in Superheated Fluids |url = http://www.labmanager.com/lab-health-and-safety/2010/09/3-limitations-of-using-boiling-chips-in-superheated-fluids#.WYxve7aQzGg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = boulder&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[CU Boulder]] | title = Boiling Chips | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416020559/http://orgchem.colorado.edu/hndbksupport/dist/boilchip.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Materials ==

Boiling chips are typically made of a porous material, such as [[alumina]], [[silicon carbide]], [[calcium carbonate]], [[calcium sulfate]], [[porcelain]] or [[carbon]], and often have a nonreactive coating of [[PTFE]]. This ensures that the boiling chips will provide effective nucleation sites, yet are chemically [[Chemically inert|inert]]. In less demanding situations, like school laboratories, pieces of broken [[porcelain]]ware or [[Laboratory glassware|glassware]] are often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brinstrument.com/fractional-distillation/Boiling-Chips.html |title=Boiling Chips&amp;nbsp;— Boiling Stones |publisher=Brinstrument.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem03/chem03396.htm |title=Boiling Chips and Purity |publisher=Newton.dep.anl.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}} (dead link 2018-08-07)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2035">{{Well logging}}
A '''caliper log''' is a [[well logging]] tool that provides a continuous measurement of the size and shape of a [[borehole]] along its depth&lt;ref&gt; Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=caliper%20log&lt;/ref&gt; and is commonly used in [[hydrocarbon exploration]] when drilling wells.  The measurements that are recorded can be an important indicator of cave ins or [[shale]] swelling in the borehole, which can affect the results of other well logs.

==Process==
The caliper tool measures the variation in borehole diameter as it is withdrawn from the bottom of the hole, using two or more articulated arms that push against the borehole wall.  Each arm is typically connected to a [[potentiometer]] which causes the resistance to change as the [[diameter]] of the borehole changes, creating a varying electrical signal that represents the changing shape of the borehole.  This variation in output is translated into changes of diameter after a simple calibration and the caliper log is printed as a continuous series of values of hole diameter with depth.

==Accuracy==
Known challenges with caliper logging include [[borehole spiralling]]. The position of the [[drill bit]] may precess as it drills, leading to spiraling shapes in the wellbore wall, as if the hole had been drilled by a [[screw]]. If the arms of the caliper log follow the grooves of the spiral, it will report too high an average diameter. Moving in and out of the grooves, the caliper will give erratic or periodically varying readings.

In most cases, the borehole's circumference will not be a perfect circle and therefore a caliper tool with several arms is required to obtain a true understanding of the size and shape of the borehole.  The borehole can change to an oval shape after drilling, which can cause the caliper log to overestimate the size of the borehole if its arms get stuck axis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1140">A '''cruising rod''' is a simple device used to quickly estimate the number of pieces of [[lumber]] yielded by a given piece of [[timber]].  Similarly to a [[yardstick]], it is a rod with markings. The estimation is carried out as follows. Standing at arm's length from the tree, estimate its average diameter by taking a note on the rod's markings. Walk away to see the whole tree; hold the rod upright at the distance from the eye at which the rod and the tree appear of the same diameter; the noted mark on the rod will show an approximate location of an 8-foot log cut along the tree height. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.na.fs.fed.us/stewardship/newsltr/newsletter/02spring_summer.pdf Forest Stewardship Newsletter with Article on Cruising Rods], reprinted from the Small Woodlot Owners Association of Maine newsletter, (''SWOAM News'', November 2001, Volume 26, Number 11)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resettlement and Shatial Museum==

Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) on December 15th, 2015 has signed a contract worth Rs571.95 million with China Railway First Group for construction at resettlement sites and building the Shatial museum – two schemes that are part of the Dasu hydroelectric power project.

The contract includes construction at three sites for the resettlement of displaced people belonging to Choochang village and developing an open-air museum at the archeological site of Shatial to conserve pre-historic rock carvings. Work on these schemes is expected to be completed in one and a half years.

The main works of DASU Hydropower project are being constructed by China Gezhouba Group Company Limited {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

'''Delta Air Lines Flight 191''' was a regularly scheduled [[Delta Air Lines]] domestic service from [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], to [[Los Angeles]] with an intermediate stop at [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] (DFW).  On August 2, 1985, the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] operating Flight 191 encountered a [[microburst]] while on approach to land at DFW. The aircraft struck the ground over a mile short of the runway, struck a car near the airport, and then collided with two water tanks and disintegrated. The crash killed 137 people and injured 28 others.{{efn|name="fatality footnote"|The crash of Flight 191 ultimately killed 137 people, including 136 people aboard the aircraft (all 3 flight crew members, 5 cabin crew members, and 128 passengers) and one person on the ground.&lt;ref name="Sun-Sentinel: Death Toll Reaches 137"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-10-04/news/8502130006_1_parkland-memorial-hospital-crash-injuries |title=Delta Crash Toll Hits 137 |publisher=Sun-Sentinel |date=October 4, 1985 |accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post says 137 fatalities"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2014/07/02/defeating-the-downburst-20-years-since-last-u-s-commercial-jet-accident-from-wind-shear/ |title=Defeating the downburst: 20 years since last U.S. commercial jet accident from wind shear |last=Smith |first=Mike |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=July 2, 2014 |accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times says 137 fatalities"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/01/us/delta-puzzled-by-recent-scars-on-its-record.html |title=Delta Puzzled by Recent Scars on Its Record |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 1, 1988 |accessdate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This total includes two passengers who initially survived the crash but later died as a result of their injuries.&lt;ref name="DMN Safety Overhaul"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/transportation/20100801-1985-Delta-191-disaster-at-D-7484.ece |title=1985 Delta 191 disaster at D/FW Airport gave rise to broad safety overhaul |last=Torbenson |first=Eric |newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |date=August 2, 2010 |accessdate=September 1, 2016 |quote=One of the plane's wing engines struck a car on State Highway 114, killing its driver, and the plane bounced into a water tank and exploded.

=== Crew members ===
Three [[flight crew]] and eight [[cabin crew]] members manned Flight 191. 

The captain, Edward N. Connors, age 57, had been a Delta Air Lines employee since 1954. He qualified to captain the TriStar in 1979 and had passed his proficiency checks.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;. The NTSB report mentioned that other flight crew that had flown with Connors prior to the accident described him as a meticulous pilot who strictly adhered to company policies.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;. The report also stated that Connors "deviated around thunderstorms even if other flights took more direct routes" and "willingly accepted suggestions from his flightcrew."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt; Since his qualification in 1979, Connors had passed all eight en route inspections he had undergone, and the NTSB report notes that he had received "favorable comments" regarding "cockpit discipline and standardization."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;. Connors had logged over 29,300 hours of flight time, 3,000 of which had been in the TriStar.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;

Flight 191's first officer was Rudolph P. Price Jr, age 42.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|92}} Delta captains who flew with Price described him as an "above average first officer" and possessing "excellent knowledge" of the TriStar.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|7}} Price had logged 6,500 flight hours, including 1,200 in the TriStar.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;. The [[flight engineer]], Nick N. Nassick, age 43, had logged 6,500 hours of flight time, including 4,500 in the TriStar.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Crash of Flight 191: As They Are Remembered |newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |date=August 11, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AOPA 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/2012/April/1/Revisiting-a-Tragedy |title=Revisiting a Tragedy |last=Hirschman |first=Dave |publisher=[[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]] |date=April 1, 2012 |accessdate=January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Delta employees described him as "observant, alert, and professional."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;

Eight flight attendants were aboard the flight: Frances Alford, Jenny Amatulli, Freida Artz, Vicki Chavis, Diane Johnson, Alyson Lee, Joan Modzelewski, and Wendy Robinson.  Flight attendants Jenny Amatulli, Vicki Chavis, and Wendy Robinson were the only crew members who survived. &lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;

==Flight==
===History of the flight===
Flight 191 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from [[Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport]] in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], with a scheduled stop at [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]].  The flight departed Fort Lauderdale on an [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR) flight plan at 14:10 [[Central Time Zone#Central Daylight Time|Central Daylight Time]] ([[UTC−05:00]]).&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="Bedell 1985"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Ill-Fated Voyage of Flight 191 |last=Bedell |first=Doug |newspaper=The Dallas Morning News |date=August 4, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name="time footnote"|The NTSB report describes Flight 191 as departing Fort Lauderdale at 15:10 [[Eastern Time Zone#Eastern Daylight Time|Eastern Daylight Time]] ([[UTC−04:00]]). All other times given in the NTSB report are in [[Central Time Zone#Central Daylight Time|Central Daylight Time]] ([[UTC−05:00]]).&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  For consistency and ease of reading, all times in this article are in Central Daylight Time.}} The flight's [[flight dispatcher|dispatch]] weather forecast for DFW stated a "possibility of widely scattered rain showers and thunderstorms."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|1}} Another dispatch weather alert warned of "an area of isolated thunderstorms&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;over [[Oklahoma]] and northern and northeastern [[Texas]]."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|1}} The flight crew reviewed these notices before takeoff.

As the aircraft flew past [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], a weather formation near the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] strengthened. The flight crew decided to deviate from the intended route to make the more northerly [[Standard terminal arrival route|Blue Ridge arrival]] to DFW.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|2}} The flight [[Holding (aeronautics)|held]] for 10–15 minutes over the [[Texarkana, Arkansas]] [[VORTAC]]. At 17:35, the crew received an [[Automatic Terminal Information Service]] (ATIS) broadcast for weather on approach to DFW, and the [[Fort Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center]] (ARTCC) [[air traffic controller]] cleared the flight to the [[Blue Ridge, Texas]] VORTAC and instructed the flight to descend to {{convert|25000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|pages=2,99}}

At 17:43:45, the Fort Worth ARTCC controller cleared the flight down to {{convert|10000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|2}} The controller suggested they fly a [[Course (navigation)#Aircraft heading|heading]] of 250° toward the Blue Ridge approach, but Captain Connors replied that the route would take them through a [[storm cell]], stating, "I'd rather not go through it, I'd rather go around it one way or the other."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|2}} After a brief exchange, the controller gave the flight a new heading.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|2}} At 17:46:50, the controller cleared the flight direct to Blue Ridge and instructed the flight crew to descend to {{convert|9000|ft|m}}. The captain expressed his relief that the controller didn't send them on the original trajectory.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|2}} At 17:51:19, the second officer commented, "Looks like it's raining over Fort Worth."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|114}} At 17:51:42, the Fort Worth ARTCC controller transferred the flight to DFW Airport Approach Control, which cleared the flight to descend to {{convert|7000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Two minutes later, the controller asked the Delta flight to deviate by ten degrees and to slow their airspeed to {{convert|180|kn|mph}}. The flight acknowledged the request.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|116}} As the flight descended, the crew prepared the aircraft for landing. At 17:56:19, the feeder controller cleared the flight down to {{convert|5000|ft|m}}. Nine seconds later, the controller announced that there was rain north of the airport, and that the airport would be using [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) approaches.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|117}}

At 17:59:47, Price said, "We're gonna get our airplane washed."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|122}} At around the same time, the captain switched to the arrival radio frequency and informed the approach controller that they were flying at {{convert|5000|ft|m}}. The controller replied that the flight should expect to approach Runway 17L (now Runway 17C). At 18:00:36, the approach controller asked an [[American Airlines]] flight that was two aircraft ahead of Flight 191, and on the same approach, if they could see the airport.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|3}} The flight responded, "As soon as we break out of this rain shower we will."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|123}} At 18:00:51, Flight 191 was instructed to slow to {{convert|170|kn|mph}} and to turn to heading 270°. Flight 191 was instructed to descend to {{convert|3000|ft|m}} at 18:01:34.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|124}} One minute later, the approach controller turned the flight toward Runway 17L and cleared them for an ILS approach at or above {{convert|2300|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Half a minute afterward, the controller asked the flight to reduce their speed to {{convert|160|kn|mph}}, which the flight crew acknowledged. At 18:03:30 the controller advised, "And we're getting some variable winds out there due to a shower&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;out there north end of DFW."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Several seconds later, an unidentified flight crew member commented, "Stuff is moving in."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|129}}

Just three miles ahead of Flight 191 was a [[Learjet 25]] on the same approach to Runway 17L.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  While on final approach, the Learjet flew through the storm north of the airport and encountered what was later described as "light to moderate turbulence".  The Learjet encountered heavy rain and lost all forward visibility, but was able to continue its ILS approach and land safely.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|19}}  When later asked why he did not report weather conditions to the tower, the Learjet's captain testified that he had nothing to report because "the only thing that we encountered was the heavy rain."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|20}}  The tower controller handling landings on Runway 17L saw lightning from the storm cell after the Learjet landed, but before he saw Flight 191 emerge from the storm.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|66}}

===Crash===
[[File:Delta191-PathToImpact.png|thumb|upright=0.9|The flight path in the final moments. William Mayberry is killed in his car at "4".]]
At 18:03:46, the approach controller once again asked Flight 191 to reduce its speed, this time to {{convert|150|kn|mph}}, and then handed the flight over to the tower controller. Twelve seconds later, the captain radioed the tower and said, "Tower[:] Delta one ninety one heavy, out here in the rain, feels good."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|130}} The tower controller advised Flight 191 that the wind was blowing at {{convert|5|kn|mph}} with gusts up to {{convert|15|kn|mph}}, which the captain acknowledged.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|130}} The flight crew lowered the [[landing gear]] and extended their [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] for landing. At 18:04:18, Price commented, "Lightning coming out of that one.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Right ahead of us."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|131}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tailstrike.com/020885.htm|title=Delta 191 CVR Transcript|website=www.tailstrike.com|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The captain called out that they were at {{convert|1000|ft|m}} at 18:05:05. Fourteen seconds later, he cautioned Price to watch his airspeed.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|3}} At the same time, the [[cockpit voice recorder]] (CVR) captured the beginning of a sound identified as rain hitting the cockpit.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  The captain warned Price, "You're gonna lose it all of a sudden, there it is."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  At 18:05:26, the captain told Price, "Push it up, push it way up."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  Several seconds later, the CVR recorded the sound of the engines spooling up. Connors then said, "That's it."&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|3}} At 18:05:36, Connors exclaimed, "Hang on to the son of a bitch!"&lt;ref name="CVR Audio"&gt;{{cite AV media |date=August 2, 1985 |title=Delta Air Lines Flight 191 CVR Audio |medium=Audio recording |publisher=Delta Air Lines}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cox |first=Mike |date= |title=Texas Disasters: True Stories of Tragedy and Survival |url= |location= |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=201 |year=2015 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point, the aircraft began a descent from which it never recovered. The [[angle of attack]] (AOA) was over 30° and began to vary wildly over the next few seconds.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|164}} The [[Aircraft principal axes|pitch angle]] began to sink and the aircraft started descending below the glideslope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |year=1988 |title=Delta 191 Animation – Connors v.

At 18:05:44, with the aircraft descending at more than {{convert|50|ft|m}} per second&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|164}}  the [[ground proximity warning system]] (GPWS) began a series of "whoop whoop pull up" audible warnings.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="Cox book" /&gt;  The captain responded by declaring "[[Takeoff/Go-around switch|TOGA]]", aviation shorthand for the order to apply maximum thrust and abort a landing by [[Go-around|going around]].&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="Cox book" /&gt; The first officer responded by pulling up and raising the nose of the aircraft, which slowed but did not stop the plane's descent.  At 18:05:52, still descending at a rate of approximately {{convert|10|ft|m}} per second,&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|40}} the aircraft's landing gear made contact with a plowed field {{convert|6336|ft|m}} north of the runway and {{convert|360|ft|m}} east of the [[Runway#Runway markings|runway centerline]].&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|25}} Remaining structurally intact, Flight 191 remained on the ground while rolling at high speed across the farmland.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|pages=25,40}} The main landing gear left shallow depressions in the field that extended for {{convert|240|ft|m}} before disappearing and reappearing a couple of times as the aircraft approached [[Texas State Highway 114]].&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|25}}

All airport fire and emergency units were alerted within one minute of the crash. 45 seconds after first being alerted, three fire trucks from the airport's fire station No. 3 arrived at the crash and began fighting the fire. Additional units from fire stations No. 1 and No. 3 arrived within 5 minutes, and despite high wind gusts and heavy rain, the fire was mostly under control within 10 minutes after the alert was sounded.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

The first paramedics arrived within 5 minutes of the crash, and immediately established triage stations. In later testimony to NTSB officials, on-site EMTs estimated that without the on-scene triage procedures, at least half of the surviving passengers would have died.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Most of the survivors of Flight 191 were located in the aircraft's rear smoking section, which broke free from the main fuselage before the aircraft hit the water tanks. Authorities transported most of the survivors to [[Parkland Memorial Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Magnuson 2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050423-2,00.html |title=Like a Wall of Napalm |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |first=Ed |last=Magnuson |date=April 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cockpit and passenger section forward of seat row 34 had been completely fragmented by impact with the water tanks and post-crash fires; all but eight of the occupants in this section were killed. The remainder of the surviving passengers and crew were in the rear cabin and tail section, which separated relatively intact and landed on its side in an open field. Overall, the disintegration of the Tristar was so extensive that the NTSB investigation was quite difficult. Survivors reported that fire broke out in the cabin prior to hitting the tanks, and began spreading through the aircraft's interior, which is consistent with the right wing's collision with the light pole and fuel tank ignition. Some of the people in the tail section were unable to free themselves due to injuries and rescue crews had to extricate them. Most survivors were also soaked with jet fuel, further adding to the difficulty of exiting the wreckage.

Two of the passengers who initially survived the crash died more than thirty days later. On the ground, an airline employee who assisted in rescuing survivors was hospitalized overnight for chest and arm pain.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|6}}  The crash ultimately killed 137 people, including 128 of the 152 passengers and 8 of the 11 crew, and the driver of the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/04/us/the-casualties-and-survivors-of-delta-crash.html|title=THE CASUALTIES AND SURVIVORS OF DELTA CRASH|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delta Air Lines Flight 191 has the second-highest death toll of any aviation accident involving a Lockheed L-1011 anywhere in the world, after [[Saudia Flight 163]].

== Investigation ==
Numerous public safety agencies responded to the crash, including the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport Department of Public Safety, the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Irving Fire Department, the Irving Police Department and all available third-watch personnel from the Dallas Police Department's Northwest Patrol Division and the Northeastern Sector of the Fort Worth Police Department's Patrol Division.

After a long investigation, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] deemed the cause of the crash to be attributable to pilot error (for their decision to fly through a thunderstorm), combined with extreme weather phenomena associated with microburst-induced wind shear.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  The NTSB also determined that a lack of specific training, policies, and procedures for avoiding and escaping low-altitude wind shear was a contributing factor.&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|1}}

The NTSB attributed the accident to lack of the ability to detect microbursts aboard aircraft – the radar equipment aboard aircraft at the time was unable to detect wind changes, only thunderstorms. After the investigation, [[NASA]] researchers at [[Langley Research Center]] modified a [[Boeing 737-200]] as a testbed for an on-board [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar]]. The resultant [[airborne wind shear detection and alert system]] was installed on many commercial airliners in the United States after the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] mandated that all commercial aircraft must have on-board windshear detection systems.

The NTSB was also critical of the airport for failing to notify emergency services in surrounding municipalities in a timely manner. While the airport's on-site emergency services were notified almost immediately, the DFW Department of Public Safety (DPS) Communications Center did not begin notifying off-site emergency services until nearly 10 minutes after the crash, and did not finish its notifications until 45 minutes after the crash. During notifications, DPS also failed to request ambulances from the adjacent communities of [[Irving, Texas|Irving]], [[Grapevine, Texas|Grapevine]], and [[Hurst, Texas|Hurst]]; however, Hurst responded with ambulances after personnel at its ambulance company overheard the airport crash report on a radio-frequency scanner. The NTSB concluded that the overall emergency response was effective due to the rapid response of on-airport personnel, but found "several problem areas" which under different circumstances "could affect adversely the medical treatment and survival of accident victims at the airport".&lt;ref name=" AAR-86-05 Final Report" /&gt;{{rp|76}}

== Legacy ==
Following the crash and the ensuing NTSB report, DFW's DPS made improvements to its post-crash notification system, including the introduction of an automated voice notification system to reduce notification times. In 1988, following the crash of [[Delta Air Lines Flight 1141]] while taking off from DFW, DPS completed its notification of nearby emergency services in 21 minutes; the NTSB described this as a "significant improvement" over response times after the Delta Flight 191 crash. Based on the improved response times, the NTSB issued a Safety Recommendation on January 9, 1990, calling for airport executives nationwide to consider the benefits of using automated voice notification systems for their emergency aid notifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-recs/recletters/A89_131_132.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |title=Safety Recommendation |last=Kolstead |first=James |date=January 9, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilots were also requried to train to react to microbursts and to quickly take evasive action in order to safely land the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/08/02/crash-delta-191-30-years-since-hell-ripped-open-dallas/31024123/|title=Crash of Delta 191: 30 years since hell 'ripped open'|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trial ===
The Delta Flight 191 crash resulted in the  longest aviation trial in American history, lasting fourteen months from 1988 to 1989 and presided over by [[United States federal judge|federal judge]] [[David Owen Belew Jr.]]&lt;ref name="NDTex 1989"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re Air Crash at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport on August 2, 1985 |vol=720 |reporter=F.

==Dramatization and media==
The crash was the subject of the television movie ''[[Fire and Rain (film)|Fire and Rain]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |last=Jameson |first=Jerry |year=1989 |title=[[Fire and Rain (film)|Fire and Rain]]|author-link=Jerry Jameson |medium=Motion picture |location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] TV series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'' dramatized the crash of Flight 191 in a Season 5 episode titled ''Invisible Killer''.&lt;ref name="Invisible Killer 2008"/&gt;  The crash had previously been discussed in the ''Mayday'' Season 1 episode ''Racing the Storm'', which covered the weather-related crash landing of [[American Airlines Flight 1420]].&lt;ref name="Racing the Storm"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Racing the Storm |series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]] |network=[[Discovery Channel Canada]] / [[National Geographic Channel]] |season=1 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Electrical-tape black.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Electrical tape, standard black]]

'''Electrical tape''' (or '''insulating tape''') is a type of [[pressure-sensitive tape]] used to [[Electrical insulation|insulate]] [[electrical wire]]s and other materials that conduct [[electricity]]. It can be made of many [[plastic]]s, but vinyl is most popular, as it stretches well and gives an effective and long lasting insulation. Electrical tape for [[Insulation system|class H]] insulation is made of fiberglass cloth.

== Varieties ==
[[File:Isolierband 0067.JPG|thumb|A selection of color-coded electrical tapes.]]

A wide variety of electrical tapes is available; some for highly specialized purposes. "The primary tapes used in electrical applications are vinyl, rubber, mastic, and varnished cambric."&lt;ref name="Art"&gt;Bob Goodman and Rodney G. Brown (3M). "[https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/374996O/ec-m-tape-article.pdf Electrical Taping Skills: A Lost Art?]", ''EC&amp;M'', p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electrician]]s generally use only black tape for insulation purposes. The other colors are used to indicate the [[voltage]] level and [[Polyphase system|phase]] of the wire. (In fact, the colored tape is referred to as "phasing tape.") This is done on large wire which is available only in black insulation. When wires are phased, a ring of tape is placed on each end near the termination so that the purpose of the wire is obvious. The following table(s) describe the use of electrical tape.

Tape that is approved for electrical applications will carry an approval label from an agency such as  [[Underwriters Laboratories]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ul.com/marks/ul-listing-and-classification-marks/labels/authorized-label-suppliers/ Authorized Label Suppliers]", ''UL.com''. Accessed January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Skills and training are important as well.&lt;ref name="Art"/&gt;

== History ==

Today electrical tape is simply, "another form of insulation".&lt;ref&gt;Horner, Jim (1986). ''Automotive Electrical Handbook'', p.68. Penguin. {{ISBN|9780895862389}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The original electrical insulating tape was made of cloth tape impregnated with [[Chatterton's compound]], an adhesive material manufactured using [[Gutta-percha]]. This type of tape was often used to insulate [[soldering|soldered]] splices on [[knob and tube wiring]].  It was commonly referred to as "friction tape", and had the unique property of being sticky on both sides.  Because of this, no matter how it was used it stuck to itself very readily.

In the early 1940s, vinyl plastic emerged as a versatile material for a wide range of applications, from shower curtains to cable insulation. A major ingredient in vinyl film was [[tricresyl phosphate]] (TCP), which was used as a plasticizer. Unfortunately, TCP tended to migrate, giving the surface of the vinyl film an oily quality and degrading every tape adhesive known. Research chemists and engineers at [[3M]] set out to create a dependable, pressure-sensitive tape made of vinyl film that would have the required electrical, physical and chemical properties.

Experiments were conducted combining new plasticizers with the white, flour-like vinyl resin. Finally, in January 1946, inventors Snell, Oace, and Eastwold of 3M applied for a patent for a vinyl electrical tape with a plasticizer system and non-sulfur-based rubber adhesive that were compatible. The first commercially available version of the tape was sold for use as a wire-harness wrapping. This original black tape wasn't black. Tapes formulated for high-temperature were yellow, and later versions were white. Electrically insulating tapes are essential for enhancing functionality and reliability in a wide range of applications. Some of the most popular types include electrically insulating adhesive tape and electrically insulating film, both of which provide reliable electronic isolation and ensure that direct electrical connection is not made between two or more circuits or their adjacent parts. There is also electrically conducting tape for shielding and similar applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://products.robertmckeown.com/category/electronic-tapes|title=Electrically Conductive Tape &amp;amp; Composite Adhesives On Robert McKeown Co., Inc.|work=Robert McKeown Co., Inc.|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; White tape, because of its instability in ultraviolet light, was eventually replaced with black tape, although colored vinyl tapes are still used as identification and marking tapes. Black became the standard industry color for vinyl standard tape, primarily because of its ultraviolet resistance. Thicknesses originally were 4&amp;nbsp;mil (100&amp;nbsp;µm), 8&amp;nbsp;mil (200&amp;nbsp;µm) and 12&amp;nbsp;mil (300&amp;nbsp;µm). These were standardized to 7&amp;nbsp;mil (180&amp;nbsp;µm) and 10&amp;nbsp;mil (250&amp;nbsp;µm) in 1948.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11787">The familiar explanation for jet thrust is a "black box" description which only looks at what goes into the [[jet engine]], air and fuel, and what comes out, exhaust gas and an unbalanced force. This force, called thrust, is the sum of the momentum difference between entry and exit and any unbalanced pressure force between entry and exit, as explained in "Thrust calculation". 

As an example, an early turbojet, the [[Bristol Olympus]] Mk. 101, had a momentum thrust of 9300 lb. and a pressure thrust of 1800 lb. giving a total of 11,100 lb.&lt;ref&gt;"The Avro Type 698 Vulcan" David W. Fildes, Pen &amp; Sword Aviation 2012, {{ISBN|978 1 84884 284 7}}, p.301, Gas Floow Diagram&lt;/ref&gt; Looking inside the "black box" shows that the thrust results from all the unbalanced momentum and pressure forces created within the engine itself.&lt;ref&gt;The Aircraft Gas Turbine and its operation December 1982, P&amp;W Oper. Instr. 200, United Technologies Pratt &amp; Whitney&lt;/ref&gt; These forces, some forwards and some rearwards, are across all the internal parts, both stationary and rotating, such as ducts, compressors, etc., which are in the primary gas flow which flows through the engine from front to rear. The algebraic sum of all these forces is delivered to the airframe for propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Jet Propulsion For Aerospace Applications" Second Edition 1964, Pitman Publishing Corp., Library of Congress Catalog card Number 64-18757, p.262&lt;/ref&gt; "Flight" gives examples of these internal forces for two early jet engines, the [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] Ra.14&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%201484.html|title=flight - flight pdf - pdf archive - 1957 - 1484 - Flight Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[de Havilland Goblin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%200353.html|title=goblin - lb - flight - 1946 - 0353 - Flight Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transferring thrust to the aircraft  ==
The engine thrust acts along the engine centreline. The aircraft "holds" the engine on the outer casing of the engine at some distance from the engine centreline (at the engine mounts). This arrangement causes the engine casing to bend (known as backbone bending) and the round rotor casings to distort (ovalization). Distortion of the engine structure has to be controlled with suitable mount locations to maintain acceptable rotor and seal clearances and prevent rubbing. A well-publicized example of excessive structural deformation occurred with the original [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D]] engine installation in the [[Boeing 747]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%203201.html|title=1969 - 3201 - Flight Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine mounting arrangement had to be revised with the addition of an extra thrust frame to reduce the casing deflections to an acceptable amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US3675418|title=Jet engine force frame|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"747 Creating the world's first jumbo jet and other adventures from a life in aviation" Joe Sutter, Smithsonian Books, {{ISBN|978-0-06-088241-9}}, p.185-188&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rotor thrust ==
The rotor thrust on a thrust bearing is not related to the engine thrust. It may even change direction at some RPM. The bearing load is determined by bearing life considerations. Although the aerodynamic loads on the compressor and turbine blades contribute to the rotor thrust they are small compared to cavity loads inside the rotor which result from the secondary air system pressures and sealing diameters on discs, etc. To keep the load within the bearing specification seal diameters are chosen accordingly as, many years ago, on the backface of the impeller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%200202.html|title=de havilland - 1947 - 0202 - Flight Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[de Havilland Ghost]] engine. Sometimes an extra disc known as a balance piston has to be added inside the rotor. An early turbojet example with a balance piston&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1955/1955%20-%201778.html|title=rolls-royce avon - 1955 - 1778 - Flight Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Rolls-Royce Avon]].

Most types of jet engine have an air intake, which provides the bulk of the fluid exiting the exhaust. Conventional rocket engines, however, do not have an intake, so '''''ṁ&lt;sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;air&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is zero. Therefore, rocket engines do not have ram drag and the gross thrust of the rocket engine nozzle is the net thrust of the engine. Consequently, the thrust characteristics of a rocket motor are different from that of an air breathing jet engine, and thrust is independent of velocity.

If the velocity of the jet from a jet engine is equal to sonic velocity, the jet engine's nozzle is said to be choked. If the nozzle is choked, the pressure at the nozzle exit plane is greater than atmospheric pressure, and extra terms must be added to the above equation to account for the pressure thrust.&lt;ref name=Cumpsty/&gt;{{cn|date=July 2018}}{{dubious|jet engines ubiquitously run choked|date=July 2018}}

The rate of flow of fuel entering the engine is often very small compared with the rate of flow of air.&lt;ref name=Cumpsty/&gt; When the contribution of fuel to the nozzle gross thrust can be ignored, the net thrust is:

:&lt;math&gt;F_N = \dot{m}_{air} (v_e - v)&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity of the jet ('''''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''''') must exceed the true airspeed of the aircraft ('''''v''''') if there is to be a net forward thrust on the aircraft. The velocity ('''''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''''') can be calculated thermodynamically based on [[adiabatic expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/SPRING/propulsion/notes/node139.html 16.Unified: Thermodynamics and Propulsion, Prof. Z. S. Spakovszky]. Scroll down to "Performance of Turbojet Engines, Section 11.6.4. (Obtained from the website of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thrust augmentation ==
Thrust augmentation has taken many forms, most commonly to supplement inadequate take-off thrust. Some early jet aircraft needed rocket assistance to take off from high altitude airfields or when the day temperature was high. A more recent aircraft, the [[Tupolev Tu-22]] supersonic bomber, was fitted with four SPRD-63 boosters for take-off.&lt;ref&gt;"Tupolev Tu-22 Blinder" Sergey Burdin &amp; Alan E Dawes 2006, Pen &amp; Sword Aviation, {{ISBN|1 84415 241 3}}, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly the most extreme requirement needing rocket assistance, and which was short-lived, was [[zero-length launch]]ing. Almost as extreme, but very common, is catapult assistance from aircraft carriers. Rocket assistance has also been used during flight. The [[SEPR 841]] booster engine was used on the [[Dassault Mirage]] for high altitude interception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%200376.html|title=atar - snecma - pressure ratio - 1960 - 0376 - Flight Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early aft-fan arrangements which added bypass airflow to a turbojet were known as thrust augmentors.&lt;ref&gt;''Gas turbine aero-thermodynamics : with special reference to aircraft propulsion'' Sir Frank Whittle, Pergamon Press Ltd. 1981, {{ISBN|9780080267197}}. p.220&lt;/ref&gt; The aft-fan fitted to the [[General Electric CJ805]]-3 turbojet augmented the take-off thrust from 11,650lb to 16,100lb.

Water, or other coolant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1952/1952%20-%200092.html|title=gas turbines - flight boosting - boosting gas - 1952 - 0092 - Flight Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; injection into the compressor or combustion chamber and fuel injection into the jetpipe ([[afterburning]]/reheat) became standard ways to increase thrust, known as 'wet' thrust to differentiate with the no-augmentation 'dry' thrust.

Coolant injection (pre-compressor cooling) has been used, together with afterburning, to increase thrust at supersonic speeds. The 'Skyburner' [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]] set a world speed record using water injection in front of the engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steeljawscribe.com/2007/03/23/flightdeck-friday-the-yf4h-1-phantom-ii-operations-skyburner-and-sageburner|title=Flightdeck Friday: The YF4H-1 Phantom II – Operations Skyburner and Sageburner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At high Mach numbers afterburners supply progressively more of the engine thrust as the thrust from the turbomachine drops off towards zero at which speed the engine pressure ratio (epr) has fallen to 1.0 and all the engine thrust comes from the afterburner. The afterburner also has to make up for the pressure loss across the turbomachine which is a drag item at higher speeds where the epr will be less than 1.0.&lt;ref&gt;"Jet Propulsion For Aerospace Applications" Second Edition 1964, Hesse and Mumford, Pitman Publishing Corporation, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 64-18757, p.375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"F-12 Series Aircraft Propulsion System Performance and Development, David H. Campbell, J. Aircraft Vol.II, No.11, November 1974, p.672&lt;/ref&gt;

Thrust augmentation of existing afterburning engine installations for special short-duration tasks has been the subject of studies for launching small payloads into low earth orbits using aircraft such as [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]], [[Dassault Rafale]] and [[Mikoyan MiG-31]],&lt;ref&gt;"Water injection pre-compressor cooling assist space access" Mehta, Huynh, Hagseth, The Aeronautical Journal, February 2015, Volume 19, Number 1212, p.147&lt;/ref&gt; and also for carrying experimental packages to high altitudes using a [[Lockheed SR-71]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19970019923.pdf |title=Data |website=ntrs.nasa.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first case an increase in the existing maximum speed capability is required for orbital launches. In the second case an increase in thrust within the existing speed capability is required. Compressor inlet cooling is used in the first case. A [[compressor map]] shows that the airflow reduces with increasing compressor inlet temperature although the compressor is still running at maximum RPM (but reduced aerodynamic speed). Compressor inlet cooling increases the aerodynamic speed and flow and thrust. In the second case a small increase in the maximum mechanical speed and turbine temperature were allowed, together with nitrous oxide injection into the afterburner and simultaneous increase in afterburner fuel flow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16210">'''GeSbTe''' ('''germanium-antimony-tellurium''' or '''GST''') is a [[phase-change material]] from the group of [[chalcogenide glass]]es used in rewritable [[optical disc]]s and [[phase-change memory]] applications. Its recrystallization time is 20 nanoseconds, allowing [[bitrate]]s of up to 35 [[megabit|Mbit]]/s to be written and direct overwrite capability up to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cycles. It is suitable for land-groove recording formats. It is often used in [[DVD-RW|rewritable DVDs]]. New phase-change memories are possible using [[doping (semiconductors)|n-doped]] GeSbTe [[semiconductor]]. The [[melting point]] of the [[alloy]] is about 600&amp;nbsp;°C (900 K) and the [[crystallization]] temperature is between 100 and 150&amp;nbsp;°C.

During writing, the material is erased, initialized into its [[crystalline]] state, with low-intensity laser irradiation. The material heats up to its crystallization temperature, but not its melting point, and crystallizes. The information is written at the crystalline phase, by heating spots of it with short (&lt;10 ns), high-intensity [[laser]] pulses; the material melts locally and is quickly cooled, remaining in the [[amorphous]] phase. As the amorphous phase has lower [[reflectivity]] than the crystalline phase, data can be recorded as dark spots on the crystalline background.

==Material properties==
[[Image:phase diagram.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Phase diagram of the GeSbTe ternary alloy system]]
GeSbTe is a ternary compound of [[germanium]], [[antimony]], and [[tellurium]], with composition GeTe-Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In the GeSbTe system, there is a pseudo-line as shown upon which most of the alloys lie. Moving down this pseudo-line, it can be seen that as we go from Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to GeTe, the melting point and [[glass transition temperature]] of the materials increase, crystallization speed decreases and data retention increases. Hence, in order to get high data transfer rate, we need to use material with fast crystallization speed such as Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This material is not stable because of its low activation energy. On the other hand, materials with good amorphous stability like GeTe has slow crystallization speed because of its high activation energy. In its stable state, crystalline GeSbTe has two possible configurations: [[hexagonal close packed|hexagonal]] and a metastable [[face centered cubic]] (FCC) lattice. When it is rapidly crystallized however, it was found to have a distorted [[rocksalt]] structure. GeSbTe has a glass transition temperature of around 100&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morales-Sanchez ''et al.'', J. Appl. Phys. 91, 697 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; GeSbTe also has many [[vacancy defect]]s in the lattice, of 20 to 25% depending on the specific GeSbTe compound. Hence, Te has an extra [[lone pair]] of electrons, which are important for many of the characteristics of GeSbTe. Crystal defects are also common in GeSbTe and due to these defects, an [[Urbach tail]] in the [[band structure]] is formed in these compounds. GeSbTe is generally [[p-type semiconductor|p type]] and there are many electronic states in the [[band gap]] accounting for acceptor and donor like traps. GeSbTe has two stable states, crystalline and amorphous. The phase change mechanism from high resistance amorphous phase to low resistance crystalline phase in nano-timescale and threshold switching are two of the most important characteristic of GeSbTe.

== Applications in phase-change memory==
The unique characteristic that makes [[phase-change memory]] useful as a memory is the ability to effect a reversible phase change when heated or cooled, switching between stable amorphous and crystalline states. These alloys have high resistance in the amorphous state ‘0’ and are [[semimetal]]s in the crystalline state ‘1’. In amorphous state, the atoms have short-range atomic order and low free electron density. The alloy also has high resistivity and activation energy. This distinguishes it from the crystalline state having low resistivity and activation energy, long-range atomic order and high free electron density. When used in phase-change memory, use of a short, high amplitude electric pulse such that the material reaches melting point and rapidly quenched changes the material from crystalline phase to amorphous phase is widely termed as RESET current and use of a relatively longer, low amplitude electric pulse such that the material reaches only the crystallization point and given time to crystallize allowing phase change from amorphous to crystalline is known as SET current.

The early devices were slow, power consuming and broke down easily due to the large currents. Therefore, it did not succeed as [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] and [[flash memory]] took over. In the 1980s though, the discovery of germanium-antimony-tellurium (GeSbTe) meant that phase-change memory now needed less time and power to function. This resulted in the success of the rewriteable optical disk and created renewed interest in the phase-change memory. The advances in [[lithography]] also meant that previously excessive programming current has now become much smaller as the volume of GeSbTe that changes phase is reduced.

Phase-change memory has many near ideal memory qualities such as [[non-volatility]], fast switching speed, high endurance of more than 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; read –write cycles, non-destructive read, direct overwriting and long data retention time of more than 10 years. The one advantage that distinguishes it from other next generation non-volatile memory like [[magnetic random access memory]] (MRAM) is the unique scaling advantage of having better performance with smaller sizes. The limit to which phase-change memory can be scaled is hence limited by lithography at least until 45&amp;nbsp;nm. Thus, it offers the biggest potential of achieving ultra-high memory density cells that can be commercialized.

Though phase-change memory offers much promise, there are still certain technical problems that need to be solved before it can reach ultra-high density and commercialized. The most important challenge for phase-change memory is to reduce the programming current to the level that is compatible with the minimum MOS transistor drive current for high-density integration. Currently, the programming current in phase-change memory is substantially high. This high current limits the memory density of the [[phase-change memory]] cells as the current supplied by the transistor is not sufficient due to their high current requirement. Hence, the unique scaling advantage of phase-change memory cannot be fully utilized.

[[File:Diagram showing the typical structure of a phase-change memory device.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A picture showing the typical structure of a phase-change memory device]]
The typical phase-change memory device design is shown. It has layers including the top electrode, GST, the GeSbTe layer, BEC, the bottom [[electrode]] and the [[dielectric]] layers. The programmable volume is the GeSbTe volume that is in contact with the bottom electrode. This is the part that can be scaled down with lithography. The thermal time constant of the device is also important. The thermal time constant must be fast enough for GeSbTe to cool rapidly into the amorphous state during RESET but slow enough to allow crystallization to occur during SET state. The thermal time constant depends on the design and material the cell is built. To read, a low current pulse is applied to the device. A small current ensures the material does not heat up. Information stored is read out by measuring the resistance of the device.

==Threshold switching==
Threshold switching occurs when GeSbTe goes from a high [[resistive]] state to a [[conductive]] state at the threshold field of about 56 V/um.&lt;ref name=Krebs&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.3210792| title = Threshold field of phase change memory materials measured using phase change bridge devices| journal = Applied Physics Letters| volume = 95| issue = 8| pages = 082101| year = 2009| last1 = Krebs| first1 = Daniel| last2 = Raoux| first2 = Simone| last3 = Rettner| first3 = Charles T.| last4 = Burr| first4 = Geoffrey W.| last5 = Salinga| first5 = Martin| last6 = Wuttig| first6 = Matthias| bibcode = 2009ApPhL..95h2101K}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen from the [[Electric current|current]]-[[voltage]] (IV) plot, where current is very low in the amorphous state at low voltage until threshold voltage is reached. Current increases rapidly after the voltage [[Snapback (electrical)|snapback]]. The material is now in the amorphous "ON" state, where the material is still amorphous, but in a pseudo- crystalline electric state. In crystalline state, the IV characteristics is [[Ohm's Law|ohmic]]. There had been debate on whether threshold switching was an electrical or [[thermal]] process. There were suggestions that the [[Exponential growth|exponential]] increase in current at threshold voltage must have been due to generation of carriers that vary exponentially with voltage such as impact [[ionization]] or [[Quantum tunnelling|tunneling]].&lt;ref name=ST&gt;A. Pirovano, A.L. Lacaita, A. Benvenuti, F. Pellizzer, R. Bez IEEE Trans. Electron Devices Vol. 51, No. 3, 452 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:RESET SET.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A graph showing the RESET current pulse with high [[amplitude]] and short duration and SET current with lower amplitude and longer duration]]

==Nano-timescale phase change==
Recently, much research has focused on the material analysis of the phase-change material in an attempt to explain the high speed phase change of GeSbTe. Using [[EXAFS]], it was found that the most matching model for crystalline GeSbTe is a distorted rocksalt lattice and for amorphous a tetrahedral structure. The small change in configuration from distorted rocksalt to tetrahedral suggests that nano-timescale phase change is possible&lt;ref name=Kolobov&gt;A.V. Kolobov, P. Fons, A.I. Frenkel, A.L. Ankudinov, J. Tominaga, T. Uruga Nature Vol. 3, 703 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; as the major [[covalent bond]]s are intact and only the weaker bonds are broken.

Using the most possible crystalline and amorphous local structures for GeSbTe, the fact that [[density]] of crystalline GeSbTe is less than 10% larger than amorphous GeSbTe, and the fact that [[thermodynamic free energy|free energies]] of both amorphous and crystalline GeSbTe have to be around the same magnitude, it was hypothesized from [[density functional theory]] simulations&lt;ref name=Wuttig&gt;M. Wuttig, D. Lüsebrink, D. Wamwangi, W. Wełnic, M. Gilleßen, R. Dronskowski (2007), Nature Vol. 6, 122, [[digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat1807 10.1038/nmat1807]&lt;/ref&gt; that the most stable amorphous state was the [[spinel]] structure, where Ge occupies tetrahedral positions and Sb and Te occupy octahedral positions, as the ground state energy was the lowest of all the possible configurations. By means of [[Car-Parrinello]] [[molecular dynamics]] simulations this conjecture have been theoretically confirmed.&lt;ref name =Caravati&gt;S. Caravati, M. Bernasconi, T. D. Kühne, M. Krack and M. Parrinello, Appl. Phys. Lett. 91, 171906 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Akola&gt;J. Akola and R. O. Jones, Phys. Rev. B 76, 235201 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nucleation-domination versus growth-domination ==
Another similar material is [[AgInSbTe]]. It offers higher linear density, but has lower overwrite cycles by 1-2 orders of magnitude. It is used in groove-only recording formats, often in [[CD-RW|rewritable CDs]]. AgInSbTe is known as a growth-dominated material while GeSbTe is known as a nucleation-dominated material. In GeSbTe, the nucleation process of crystallization is long with many small crystalline nuclei being formed before a short growth process where the numerous small crystals are joined together. In AgInSbTe, there are only a few nuclei formed in the nucleation stage and these nuclei grow bigger in the longer growth stage such that they eventually form one crystal.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;J.H. Coombs, A.P.J.M. Jongenelis, W. van Es-Spiekman, B.A.J. Jacobs J. Appl. Phys. Vol. 78, No. 8 4906 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60765">The '''Jahn–Teller effect''' (JT effect or JTE) is an important mechanism of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in molecular and solid-state systems which has far-reaching consequences for different fields, and it is related to a variety of applications in [[spectroscopy]], [[stereochemistry]] and [[crystal chemistry]], molecular and [[solid-state physics]], and [[materials science]]. The effect is named for [[Hermann Arthur Jahn]] and [[Edward Teller]], who first reported studies about it in 1937.

==Simplified overview==
The '''Jahn–Teller effect''', sometimes also known as '''Jahn–Teller distortion''', describes the geometrical distortion of [[molecule]]s and [[ion]]s that is associated with certain electron configurations.  The '''Jahn–Teller theorem''' essentially states that any nonlinear molecule with a spatially [[degenerate energy level|degenerate]] electronic ground state will undergo a geometrical distortion that removes that degeneracy, because the distortion lowers the overall energy of the species. For a description of another type of geometrical distortion that occurs in crystals with substitutional impurities see article [[off-center ions]].

===Transition metal chemistry===
[[File:Hexaaquacopper(II)-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|220px|The Jahn–Teller effect is responsible for the tetragonal distortion of the hexaaquacopper(II) complex ion, [Cu(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which might otherwise possess [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] geometry.  The two axial Cu−O distances are 238 [[picometre|pm]], whereas the four equatorial Cu−O distances are ~195 pm. This geometry is common in [[crystal structure]]s; the [[Metal ions in aqueous solution#Transition metals and group 12 metals|geometry in solution]] is uncertain.&lt;ref name="Persson"&gt;{{ cite journal | first1 = Ingmar | last1 = Persson | title = Hydrated metal ions in aqueous solution: How regular are their structures? | journal = [[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] | year = 2010 | volume = 82 | issue = 10 | pages = 1901–1917 | doi = 10.1351/PAC-CON-09-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Jahn-Teller effect in octahedral complexes.png|left|thumb|'''Above''': JT effect is observed as tetragonal elongation and compression in octahedral high-spin d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; complexes due to net change in the energy of electrons (notice odd amount of electrons in e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;-orbital). '''Below''': JT effect doesn't occur if there is no net change in energy (notice even amount of electrons in e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;-orbital).]]
The Jahn–Teller effect is most often encountered in [[octahedral complex]]es of the transition metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Shriver | first1 = D. F. | last2 = Atkins | first2 = P. W. | date = 1999 | title = Inorganic Chemistry | edition = 3rd | pages = 235–236 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-850330-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phenomenon is very common in six-coordinate [[copper]](II) complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Metal-ligand bonding | first1 = Rob | last1 = Janes | first2 = Elaine A. | last2 = Moore | publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry | date = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-85404-979-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qsP7mmhqvj4C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=%22Jahn-Teller+distortion%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''d''&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; electronic configuration of this [[ion]] gives three electrons in the two degenerate [[crystal field theory|''e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'']] orbitals, leading to a doubly degenerate electronic ground state. Such complexes distort along one of the molecular fourfold axes (always labelled the ''z'' axis), which has the effect of removing the orbital and electronic degeneracies and lowering the overall energy. The distortion normally takes the form of elongating the bonds to the ligands lying along the ''z'' axis, but occasionally occurs as a shortening of these bonds instead (the Jahn–Teller theorem does not predict the direction of the distortion, only the presence of an unstable geometry). When such an elongation occurs, the effect is to lower the electrostatic repulsion between the electron-pair on the [[Lewis base|Lewis basic]] ligand and any electrons in orbitals with a ''z'' component, thus lowering the energy of the complex. The inversion centre is preserved after the distortion.

In octahedral complexes, the Jahn–Teller effect is most pronounced when an odd number of electrons occupy the ''e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals. This situation arises in complexes with the configurations ''d''&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, [[crystal field theory|low-spin]] ''d''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; or [[crystal field theory|high-spin]] ''d''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, all of which have doubly degenerate ground states. In such compounds the ''e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals involved in the degeneracy point directly at the ligands, so distortion can result in a large energetic stabilisation. Strictly speaking, the effect also occurs when there is a degeneracy due to the electrons in the ''t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals (''i.e.'' configurations such as ''d''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; or ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, both of which are triply degenerate). In such cases, however, the effect is much less noticeable, because there is a much smaller lowering of repulsion on taking ligands further away from the ''t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals, which do not point ''directly'' at the ligands (see the table below).  The same is true in tetrahedral complexes (e.g. [[manganate]]: distortion is very subtle because there is less stabilisation to be gained because the ligands are not pointing directly at the orbitals.

The expected effects for octahedral coordination are given in the following table:

The Jahn–Teller effect is manifested in the [[UV/VIS spectroscopy|UV-VIS]] absorbance spectra of some compounds, where it often causes splitting of bands. It is readily apparent in the structures of many copper(II) complexes.&lt;ref name=Frank&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = Patrick | last2 = Benfatto | first2 = Maurizio | last3 = Szilagyi | first3 = Robert K. | last4 = D'Angelo | first4 = Paola | last5 = Della Longa | first5 = Stefano | last6 = Hodgson | first6 = Keith O. | date = 2005 | title = The Solution Structure of [Cu(aq)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Its Implications for Rack-Induced Bonding in Blue Copper Protein Active Sites | url = | journal = [[Inorganic Chemistry (journal)|Inorganic Chemistry]] | volume = 44 | issue = 6| pages = 1922–1933 | doi = 10.1021/ic0400639 | pmid = 15762718 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional, detailed information about the anisotropy of such complexes and the nature of the ligand binding can be however obtained from the fine structure of the low-temperature [[electron spin resonance]] spectra.

===Related effects===
The underlying cause of the Jahn–Teller effect is the presence of [[molecular orbitals]] that are both [[Degenerate energy levels|degenerate]] and [[open shell]] (i.e., incompletely occupied). This situation is not unique to coordination complexes and can be encountered in other areas of chemistry. In organic chemistry the phenomenon of [[antiaromaticity]] has the same cause and also often sees molecules distorting; as in the case of [[cyclobutadiene]]&lt;ref name=Senn&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senn|first1=Peter|title=A simple quantum mechanical model that illustrates the Jahn–Teller effect|journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education]]|date=October 1992|volume=69|issue=10|pages=819|doi=10.1021/ed069p819|bibcode = 1992JChEd..69..819S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cyclooctatetraene]] (COT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Frank-Gerrit | last = Klärner | title = About the Antiaromaticity of Planar Cyclooctatetraene | date = 2001 | journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English]] | volume = 40 | issue = 21 | pages = 3977–3981 | doi = 10.1002/1521-3773(20011105)40:21&lt;3977::AID-ANIE3977&gt;3.0.CO;2-N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advanced treatment==

===The Jahn–Teller theorem===
The JT theorem can be stated in different forms, two of which are given here:

:"A nonlinear polyatomic system in a spatially degenerate electronic state distorts spontaneously in such a way that the degeneracy is lifted and a new equilibrium structure of lower symmetry is attained."

Alternatively and considerably shorter:
:"... stability and degeneracy are not possible simultaneously unless the molecule is a linear one ...".&lt;ref name="JahnTeller1937"/&gt;

Spin-degeneracy was an exception in the original treatment and was later treated separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Bersuker
|first=I. B.
|title=The Jahn–Teller Effect
|publisher=Cambridge University Press
|location=Cambridge
|year=2006
|isbn=9780521822121
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal mathematical proof of the Jahn–Teller theorem rests heavily on symmetry arguments, more specifically the theory of molecular [[point groups]]. The argument of [[Hermann Arthur Jahn|Jahn]] and [[Edward Teller|Teller]] assumes no details about the [[electronic structure]] of the system.  Jahn and Teller made no statement about the strength of the effect, which may be so small that it is immeasurable. Indeed, for electrons in non-bonding or weakly bonding [[molecular orbitals]], the effect is expected to be weak. However, in many situations the JT effect is important.

===Historic developments===
Interest in the JTE increased after its first experimental verification. Various model systems were developed probing the degree of [[Degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] and the type of symmetry.&lt;ref name=Bates1978&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were solved partly analytically and partly numerically to obtain the shape of the pertinent [[potential energy surface]]s (PES) and the energy levels for the nuclear motion on the JT-split PES. These energy levels are not [[Molecular vibration|vibrational]] energy levels in the traditional sense because of the intricate coupling to the electronic motion that occurs, and are better termed [[vibronic]] energy levels. The new field of ‘[[vibronic coupling]]’ or ‘vibronic coupling theory’ was born.

A further breakthrough occurred upon the advent of modern ("[[ab initio]]") [[electronic structure]] calculations whereby the relevant parameters characterising JT systems can be reliably determined from first principles. Thus one could go beyond studies of model systems that explore the effect of parameter variations on the PES and [[Vibronic coupling|vibronic]] energy levels; one could also go on beyond fitting these parameters to experimental data without clear knowledge about the significance of the fit. Instead, well-founded theoretical investigations became possible which greatly improved the insight into the phenomena at hand and into the details of the underlying mechanisms.

[[File:Jahn-Teller and pseudo Jahn-Teller effects.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|A conceptual comparison of the Jahn–Teller and pseudo Jahn–Teller effects, showing the mutual relation of two potential energy surfaces (PES) in the two cases. The number of PES is two in this picture but it can be more in actual molecular or solid-state systems.]]
While recognizing the JTE distortion as a concrete example of the general [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] mechanism, the exact degeneracy of the involved electronic state was identified as a non-essential ingredient for this [[symmetry breaking]] in polyatomic systems. Even systems that in the undistorted symmetric configuration present electronic states which are near in energy but not precisely degenerate, can show a similar tendency to distort. The distortions of these systems can be treated within the related theory of the [[pseudo Jahn–Teller effect]] (in the literature often referred to as "second-order JTE"). This mechanism is associated to the vibronic couplings between adiabatic PES separated by nonzero energy gaps across the configuration space: its inclusion extends the applicability of JT-related models to symmetry breaking in a far broader range of molecular and solid-state systems.

*[[Peierls transition|Peierls theorem]], which states that a one-dimensional equally-spaced chain of ions with one electron per ion is unstable, has common roots with the JT effect.

==Theory==

===Symmetry of JT systems and categorisation using group theory===
A given JT problem will have a particular [[point group symmetry]], such as [[Tetrahedral symmetry|T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry]] for magnetic impurity ions in [[semiconductors]] or [[Icosahedral symmetry|I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry]] for the [[Buckminsterfullerene|fullerene C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]. JT problems are conventionally classified using labels for the [[irreducible representations]] (irreps) that apply to the symmetry of the electronic and vibrational states. For example, E ⊗ e would refer to an electronic doublet state transforming as E coupled to a vibrational doublet state transforming as e.

In general, a vibrational mode transforming as Λ will couple to an electronic state transforming as Γ if the symmetric part of the [[Kronecker product]] [Γ ⊗ Γ]&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; contains Λ, unless Γ is a [[double group]] representation when the antisymmetric part {Γ ⊗ Γ}&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is considered instead. Modes which do couple are said to be JT-active.

As an example, consider a doublet electronic state E in cubic symmetry. The symmetric part of E ⊗ E is A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + E. Therefore, the state E will couple to vibrational modes &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; transforming as a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and e. However, the a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; modes will result in the same energy shift to all states and therefore do not contribute to any JT splitting. They can therefore be neglected. The result is an E ⊗ e JT effect. This JT effect is experienced by triangular molecules X&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, tetrahedral molecules ML&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and octahedral molecules ML&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; when their electronic state has E symmetry.

Components of a given vibrational mode are also labelled according to their transformation properties. For example, the two components of an e mode are usually labelled &lt;math&gt;Q_\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, which in [[octahedral symmetry]] transform as &lt;math&gt;3z^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

===The JT Hamiltonian===

Eigenvalues of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of a polyatomic system define PESs as functions of normal modes &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; of the system (i.e. linear combinations of the nuclear displacements with specific symmetry properties {{Crossreference|selfref=no|(see [[#Symmetry and Group Theory]])}}. At the reference point of high symmetry, where the symmetry-induced degeneracy occurs, several of the eigenvalues coincide. By a detailed and laborious analysis, [[Hermann Arthur Jahn|Jahn]] and [[Edward Teller|Teller]] showed that – excepting linear molecules – there are always first-order terms in an expansion of the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in terms of symmetry-lowering (in the language of [[group theory]]: non-totally symmetric) normal modes. These linear terms represent forces that distort the system along these coordinates and lift the degeneracy. The point of degeneracy can thus not be stationary, and the system distorts toward a stationary point of lower symmetry where stability can be attained.

Proof of the JT theorem follows from the theory of molecular symmetry ([[point group]] theory). A less rigorous but more intuitive explanation is given in section {{Crossreference|selfref=no|[[#Coordination Chemistry]]}}.

To arrive at a quantitative description of the JT effect, the forces appearing between the component [[wave functions]] are described by expanding the Hamiltonian in a power series in the &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;. Owing to the very nature of the degeneracy, the Hamiltonian takes the form of a matrix referring to the degenerate [[wave function]] components. A [[Matrix element (physics)|matrix element]] between states &lt;math&gt;\Psi_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Psi_b&lt;/math&gt; generally reads as:

:&lt;math&gt;H_{ab}=&lt;\Psi_a|H|\Psi_b&gt;=&lt;\Psi_a|H(Q_i=0)+\sum_{i}\frac{\partial V}{\partial Q_i} Q_i + ...|\Psi_b&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

The expansion can be truncated after terms linear in the &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;, or extended to include terms quadratic (or higher) in the &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Adiabatic process#Divergent usages of the word adiabatic|adiabatic]] [[potential energy surface]]s (APES) are then obtained as the [[eigenvalues]] of this matrix. In the original paper it is proven that there are always linear terms in the expansion. It follows that the degeneracy of the [[wave function]] cannot correspond to a stable structure.

===Potential energy surfaces===

====Mexican-hat potential====
In mathematical terms, the APESs characterising the JT distortion arise as the [[eigenvalues]] of the potential energy matrix (as described in {{Crossreference|selfref=no|[[#Symmetry and Group Theory]]}}). Generally, the APESs take the characteristic appearance of a double cone, circular or elliptic, where the point of contact, i.e. degeneracy, denotes the high-symmetry configuration for which the JT theorem applies. For the above case of the linear E ⊗ e JT effect the situation is illustrated by the APES

:&lt;math&gt;V=\frac{\mu\omega^2}{2}(Q_\theta^2 + Q_\epsilon^2) \pm k \sqrt{Q_\theta^2 + Q_\epsilon^2}&lt;/math&gt;

displayed in the figure, with part cut away to reveal its shape, which is known as a Mexican Hat potential. Here, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the vibrational e mode, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is its mass and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the strength of the JT coupling. [[File:E x e potential energy surfaces.jpg|thumb|The potential energy surfaces of an E ⊗ e Jahn–Teller effect]]

The conical shape near the degeneracy at the origin makes it immediately clear that this point cannot be [[Stationary point|stationary]], that is, the system is unstable against asymmetric distortions, which leads to a symmetry lowering. In this particular case there are infinitely many isoenergetic JT distortions. The &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; giving these distortions are arranged in a circle, as shown by the red curve in the figure. Quadratic coupling or cubic elastic terms lead to a warping along this "minimum energy path", replacing this infinite manifold by three equivalent potential minima and three equivalent saddle points. In other JT systems, linear coupling results in discrete minima.

====Conical intersections====
The high symmetry of the double-cone topology of the linear E ⊗ e JT system directly reflects the high underlying symmetry. It is one of the earliest (if not the earliest) examples in the literature of a [[conical intersection]] of potential energy surfaces. Conical intersections have received wide attention in the literature starting in the 1990s and are now considered paradigms of nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics, with far-reaching consequences in molecular spectroscopy, [[photochemistry]] and photophysics. Some of these will be commented upon further below. In general, [[conical intersection]]s are far less symmetric than depicted in the figure. They can be tilted and elliptical in shape etc., and also peaked and sloped intersections have been distinguished in the literature. Furthermore, for more than two degrees of freedom, they are not point-like structures but instead they are seams and complicated, curved hypersurfaces, also known as intersection space. The coordinate sub-space displayed in the figure is also known as a branching plane.

====Implications for dynamics====
The characteristic shape of the JT-split APES has specific consequences for the nuclear dynamics, here considered in the fully quantum sense. For sufficiently strong JT coupling, the minimum points are sufficiently far (at least by a few vibrational energy quanta) below the JT intersection. Two different energy regimes are then to be distinguished, those of low and high energy.

* In the low-energy regime the nuclear motion is confined to regions near the "minimum energy points". The distorted configurations sampled impart their geometrical parameters on, for example, the rotational fine structure in a spectrum. Due to the existence of barriers between the various minima in the APES, like those appearing due to the warping of the {{Crossreference|selfref=no|(see [[#Mexican Hat potential]])}}, motion on the low-energy regime is usually classified as either a static JTE, dynamic JTE or incoherent hopping. Each regime shows particular fingerprints on experimental measurements.

:* '''Static JTE''': In this case, the system is trapped in one of the lowest-energy minima of the APES (usually determined by small perturbations created by the environment of the JT system) and does not have enough energy to cross the barrier towards another minimum during the typical time associated to the measurement. Quantum dynamical effects like tunnelling are negligible, and effectively the molecule or solid displays the low symmetry associated with a single minimum.

:* '''Dynamic JTE''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1021/j100796a043
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the barriers are sufficiently small compared to, for example, the zero-point energy associated to the minima, so that vibronic wavefunctions (and all observables) display the symmetry of the reference (undistorted) system. In the linear E ⊗ e problem, the motion associated to this regime would be around the circular path in the figure. When the barrier is sufficiently small, this is called (free) pseudorotation (not to be confused with the rotation of a rigid body in space, see difference between real and pseudo rotations illustrated [http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~ppzjld/pseudorotate.htm here] for the [[Buckminsterfullerene|fullerene molecule]] C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;). When the barrier between the minima and the saddle points on the warped path exceeds a vibrational quantum, pseudorotational motion is slowed down and occurs through tunnelling. This is called hindered pseudorotation. In both free and hindered pseudorotation, the important phenomenon of the geometric (Berry) phase alters the ordering of the levels.

:* '''Incoherent hopping''': Another way in which the system can overcome the barrier is through thermal energy. In this case, while the system moves throughout the minima of the system, the state is not a quantum coherent one but a statistical mixture. This difference can be observed experimentally.

* The dynamics is quite different for high energies, such as occur from an optical transition from a non-degenerate initial state with a high-symmetry (JT undistorted) equilibrium geometry into a JT distorted state. This leads the system to the region near the conical intersection of the JT-split APES in the centre of the figure. Here the nonadiabatic couplings become very large and the behaviour of the system cannot be described within the familiar [[Born-Oppenheimer approximation|Born-Oppenheimer]] (BO) separation between the electronic and nuclear motions. The nuclear motion ceases to be confined to a single, well-defined APES and the transitions between the adiabatic surfaces occur yielding effects like Slonzcewsky resonances. In molecules this is usually a femtosecond timescale, which amounts to ultrafast (femtosecond) internal conversion processes, accompanied by broad spectral bands also under isolated-molecule conditions and highly complex spectral features. Examples for these phenomena will be covered in Section {{Crossreference|selfref=no|[[#Spectroscopy and Reactivity]]}}.

As already stated above, the distinction of low and high energy regimes is valid only for sufficiently strong JT couplings, that is, when several or many vibrational energy quanta fit into the energy window between the conical intersection and the minimum of the lower JT-split APES. For the many cases of small to intermediate JT couplings this energy window and the corresponding adiabatic low-energy regime does not exist. Rather, the levels on both JT-split APES are intricately mixed for all energies and the nuclear motion always proceeds on both JT split APES simultaneously.

===Ham factors===
In 1965, Frank Ham &lt;ref name=Ham1965 /&gt; proposed that the dynamic JTE could reduce the expected values of observables associated with the orbital wavefunctions due to the superposition of several electronic states in the total vibronic wavefunction. This effect leads, for example, to a partial quenching of the spin-orbit interaction&lt;ref name=Ham1965 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.166.307
|bibcode=1968PhRv..166..307H
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed the results of previous [[Electron Paramagnetic Resonance]] (EPR) experiments to be explained.

In general, the result of an orbital operator acting on vibronic states can be replaced by an effective orbital operator acting on purely electronic states. In first order, the effective orbital operator equals the actual orbital operator multiplied by a constant, whose value is less than one, known as a first-order (Ham) reduction factor. For example, within a triplet T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; electronic state, the spin-orbit coupling operator &lt;math&gt;\lambda \mathbf{L}.\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;\gamma \lambda \mathbf{L}.\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the strength of the JT coupling which varies from 1 in zero coupling to 0 in very strong coupling. Furthermore, when second-order perturbation corrections are included, additional terms are introduced involving additional numerical factors, known as second-order (Ham) reduction factors. These factors are zero when there is no JT coupling but can dominate over first-order terms in strong coupling, when the first-order effects have been significantly reduced.&lt;ref name=Bates1978 /&gt;
 
Reduction factors are particularly useful for describing experimental results, such as [[Electron paramagnetic resonance|EPR]] and optical spectra, of [[paramagnetic]] impurities in [[semiconducting]], [[dielectric]], [[diamagnetic]] and [[ferrimagnetic]] hosts.

===Modern developments===
For a long time, applications of JT theory consisted mainly in parameter studies (model studies) where the APES and dynamical properties of JT systems have been investigated as functions on the system parameters such as coupling constants etc. Fits of these parameters to experimental data were often doubtful and inconclusive. The situation changed in the 1980s when efficient ab initio methods were developed and computational resources became powerful enough to allow for a reliable determination of these parameters from first principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yates | first1 = JH | last2 = Pitzer | first2 = RM | date =1979 | title = Molecular and Electronic Structures of Transition Metal Trifluorides | journal = J. Chem. Phys. | volume = 70 | issue = 9 | pages = 4049-4055 | doi = 10.1063/1.438027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[wave function]]-based 
techniques (which are sometimes considered genuinely [[ab initio]] in the literature) the advent of [[density functional theory]] (DFT) opened up new avenues to treat larger systems including solids. This allowed details of JT systems to be characterised and experimental findings to be reliably interpreted. It lies at the heart of most developments addressed in Section {{Crossreference|selfref=no|[[#Applications]]}}.

Two different strategies are conceivable and have been used in the literature. One can

#take the applicability of a certain coupling scheme for granted and limit oneself to determine the parameters of the model, for example from the energy gain achieved through the JT distortion, also termed JT stabilisation energy.
#map parts of the APES in whole or reduced dimensionality and thus get an insight into the applicability of the model, possibly also deriving ideas how to extend it.

Naturally, the more accurate approach (2) may be limited to smaller systems, while the simpler approach (1) lends itself to studies of larger systems.

==Applications==

===Effects on structure===

====Small molecules and ions====
The JT distortion of small molecules (or molecular ions) is directly deduced from electronic structure calculations of their APES (through [[Density functional theory|DFT]] and/or ab initio computations). These molecules / ions are often radicals, such as trimers of alkali atoms (Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), that have unpaired spins and in particular in (but not restricted to) doublet states. Besides the JTE in &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;E' and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;E" states, also the {{Crossreference|selfref=no|[[Pseudo Jahn-Teller effect|pseudo JTE]]}} between an E state and a nearby A state may play a role. The JT distortion reduces the symmetry from D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; (see figure), and it depends on the details of the interactions whether the isosceles triangle has an acute or an obtuse-angled (such as Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) minimum energy structure. Natural extensions are systems like NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; where a JT distortion has been documented in the literature for ground or excited electronic states. 
[[File:Jahn-Teller distortions of a triangle.jpg|thumb|Two possible ways in which an equilateral triangle could distort due to a Jahn–Teller effect.]]

A somewhat special role is played by tetrahedral systems like CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Here threefold degenerate electronic states and vibrational modes come into play. Nevertheless, also twofold degeneracies continue to be important.

Among larger systems, a focus in the literature has been on benzene and its radical cation, as well as on their halo (especially fluoro) derivatives. Already in the early 1980s, a wealth of information emerged from the detailed analysis of experimental emission spectra of 1,3,5- trifluoro- and hexafluoro (and chloro) benzene radical cations. For the parent benzene cation one has to rely on photoelectron spectra with comparatively lower resolution because this species does not fluoresce (see also Section on {{Crossreference|selfref=no|[[#Spectroscopy and Reactivity|Spectroscopy and Reactivity]]}}). Rather detailed ab initio calculations have been carried out which 
document the JT stabilization energies for the various (four) JT active modes and also quantify the moderate barriers for the JT pseudorotation.

Finally, a somewhat special role is played by systems with a fivefold symmetry axis like the cyclopentadienyl radical. Careful laser spectroscopic investigations have shed useful light on the JT interactions. In particular they reveal that the barrier to pseudorotation almost vanishes (the system is highly "fluxional") which can be attributed to the fact that the 2nd-order coupling terms vanish by symmetry and the leading higher-order terms are of 4th order.

====Coordination chemistry====
The JTE is usually stronger where the electron density associated with the degenerate orbitals is more concentrated. This effect therefore plays a large role in determining  the structure of transition metal complexes with active internal 3d orbitals. [[File:D orbitals in an octahedron.jpg|thumb|Images of d orbitals transforming as &lt;math&gt;3z^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; embedded in an octahedron]][[File:Dlevels.png|thumb|Effect of a JT distortion on d orbitals]]

The most iconic and prominent of the JT systems in coordination chemistry is probably the case of Cu(II) octahedral complexes. While in perfectly equivalent coordination, like a CuF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; complex associated to a Cu(II) impurity in a cubic crystal like KMgF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, perfect octahedral (O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) symmetry is expected.  In fact a lower tetragonal symmetry is usually found experimentally. The origin of this JTE distortion it revealed by examining the electronic configuration of the undistorted complex. For an octahedral geometry, the five 3d orbitals partition into t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals (see diagram).  These orbitals are occupied by nine electrons corresponding to the &lt;math&gt;d^9&lt;/math&gt; electronic configuration of Cu(II). Thus, the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; shell is filled, and the e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; shell contains 3 electrons. Overall the unpaired electron produces a &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; state, which is Jahn–Teller active.  The third electron can occupy either of the orbitals comprising the e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; shell: the mainly &lt;math&gt;3z^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt; orbital or the mainly &lt;math&gt;x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; orbital.   If the electron occupies the mainly &lt;math&gt;3z^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt; level, which antibonding orbital the final geometry of the complex would be elongated as the axial ligands will be pushed away to reduce the global energy of the system. On the other hand, if the electron went into the mainly &lt;math&gt;x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; antibonding orbital the complex would distort into a compressed geometry. Experimentally elongated geometries are overwhelmingly observed and this fact has been attributed both to metal-ligand anharmonic interactions &lt;ref name=Opik1957 /&gt; and 3d-4s hybridisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1021/ic00228a031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that all the directions containing a fourfold axis are equivalent the distortion is equally likely to happen in any of these orientations. From the electronic point of view this means that the &lt;math&gt;3z^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; orbitals, that are degenerate and free to hybridise in the octahedral geometry, will mix to produce appropriate equivalent orbitals in each direction like &lt;math&gt;3x^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;3y^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The JTE is not just restricted to Cu(II) octahedral complexes. There are many other configurations, involving changes both in the initial structure and electronic configuration of the metal that yield degenerate states and, thus, JTE. However, the amount of distortion and stabilisation energy of the effect is strongly dependent on the particular case. In octahedral Cu(II), the JTE is particularly strong because

# the degenerate orbitals display a strongly antibonding σ character 
# Cu is a transition metal with a relatively strong [[electronegativity]] yielding more covalent bonds than other metals which allows to increase the JT linear coupling constant.

In other configurations involving π or δ bonding, like for example when the degenerate state is associated to the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals of an octahedral configuration, the distortion and stabilisation energies are usually much smaller and the possibility of not observing the distortion due to dynamic JT effects is much higher. Similarly for rare-earth ions where covalency is very small, the distortions associated to the JTE are usually very weak.

Importantly, the JTE is associated with strict degeneracy in the electronic subsystem and so it cannot appear in systems without this property. For example, the JTE is often associated to cases like quasi-octahedral CuX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complexes where the distances to X and Y [[ligands]] are clearly different. However, the intrinsic symmetry of these complexes is already tetragonal and no degenerate e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbital exists, having split into a&lt;sub&gt;1g&lt;/sub&gt; (mainly &lt;math&gt;3z^2-r^2&lt;/math&gt;) and b&lt;sub&gt;1g&lt;/sub&gt; (mainly &lt;math&gt;x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt;) orbitals due to the different electronic interactions with axial X [[ligands]] and equatorial Y [[ligands]]. In this and other similar cases some remaining vibronic effects related to the JTE are still present but are quenched with respect to the case with degeneracy due to the splitting of the orbitals.

===Spectroscopy and reactivity===
From spectra with rotational resolution, moments of inertia and hence bond lengths and angles can be determined "directly" (at least in principle). From less well-resolved spectra one can still determine important quantities like JT stabilization energies and energy barriers (e.g. to pseudorotation). However, in the whole spectral intensity distribution &lt;math&gt;P(E)&lt;/math&gt; of an electronic transition more information is encoded. It has been used to decide on the presence (or absence) of the geometric phase which is accumulated during the pseudorotational motion around the JT (or other type of) conical intersection. Prominent examples of either type are the ground (X) or an excited (B) state of Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;P(E)&lt;/math&gt;, the so-called autocorrelation function &lt;math&gt;C(t)&lt;/math&gt; reflects the motion of the wavepacket after an optical (= vertical) transition to the APES of the final electronic state. Typically it will move on the timescale of a vibrational period which is (for small molecules) of the order of 5-50 fs, i.e. ultrafast. Besides a nearly periodic motion, mode-mode interactions with very irregular (also chaotic) behaviour and spreading of the wavepacket may also occur. Near a conical intersection this will be accompanied/complemented by nonradiative transitions (termed internal conversion) to other APESs occurring on the same ultrafast time scale.

For the JT case the situation is somewhat special, as compared to a general conical intersection, because the different JT potential sheets are symmetry-related to each other and have (exactly or nearly) the same energy minimum. The "transition" between them is thus more oscillatory than one would normally expect, and their time-averaged populations are close to 1/2. For a more typical scenario a more general conical intersection is "required".

The JT effect still comes into play, namely in combination with a different nearby, in general non-degenerate electronic state.  The result is a [[pseudo Jahn–Teller effect]], for example, of an E state interacting with an A state. This situation is common in JT systems, just as interactions between two nondegenerate electronic states are common for  non-JT systems. Examples are excited electronic states of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the benzene radical cation. Here, crossings between the E and A state APESs amount to triple intersections, which are associated with very complex spectral features (dense line structures and diffuse spectral envelopes under low resolution). The population transfer between the states is also ultrafast, so fast that fluorescence (proceeding on a nanosecond time scale) cannot compete. This helps to understand why the benzene cation, like many other organic radical cation, does not fluoresce.

To be sure, photochemical reactivity emerges when the internal conversion makes the system explore the nuclear configuration space such that new chemical species are formed. There is a plethora of femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopic techniques to reveal details of these processes occurring, for example, in the process of vision.

===Solid-state problems===

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
free electrons in a solid, introduced for example by doping or irradiation, can interact with the vibrations of the lattice to form a localized quasi-particle known as a [[polaron]]. Strongly localized polarons (also called Holstein polarons) can condensate around high-symmetry sites of the lattice with electrons or holes occupying local degenerate orbitals that experience the JTE. These Jahn–Teller polarons break both translational and point group symmetries of the lattice where they are found and have been attributed important roles in effects like [[colossal magnetoresistance]] and [[superconductivity]].

[[Paramagnetic]] impurities in [[semiconducting]], [[dielectric]], [[diamagnetic]] and [[ferrimagnetic]] hosts can all be described using a JT model. For example, these models were used extensively in the 1980s and 1990s to describe ions of Cr, V and Ti substituting for Ga in GaAs and GaP.

The [[Buckminsterfullerene|fullerene]] C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; can form solid compounds with alkali metals known as [[fullerides]]. Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; can be superconducting at temperatures up to 38K under applied pressure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

JT effects both within the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecules (intramolecular) and between C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecules (intermolecular) play a part in the mechanisms behind various observed properties in these systems. For example, they could mean that the Migdal-Eliashberg treatment of [[superconductivity]] breaks down. Also, the fullerides can form a so-called new state of matter known as a Jahn–Teller metal, where localised electrons coexist with [[metallicity]] and JT distortions on the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecules persist &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Cooperative JT effect in crystals====
The JTE is usually associated with degeneracies that are well localised in space, like those occurring in a small molecule or associated to an isolated transition metal complex. However, in many periodic high-symmetry solid-state systems, like perovskites, some crystalline sites allow for electronic degeneracy giving rise under adequate compositions to lattices of JT-active centers. This can produce a cooperative JTE, where global distortions of the crystal occur due to local degeneracies.

In order to determine the final electronic and geometric structure of a cooperative JT system, it is necessary to take into account both the local distortions and the interaction between the different sites, which will take such form necessary to minimise the global energy of the crystal.

While works on the cooperative JTE started in the late fifties

}}&lt;/ref&gt; can lead to structural [[phase transitions]].

It is important to note that many cooperative JT systems would be expected to be metals from band theory as, to produce them, a degenerate orbital has to be partially filled and the associated band would be metallic. However, under the perturbation of the symmetry-breaking distortion associated to the cooperative JTE, the degeneracies in the electronic structure are destroyed and the ground state of these systems is often found to be insulating (see e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In many important cases like the parent compound for [[colossal magnetoresistance]] perovskites, LaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, an increase of temperature leads to disorder in the distortions which lowers the band splitting due to the cooperative JTE, thus triggering a metal-insulator transition.

==== JT-related effects: Orbital ordering ====
In modern solid-state physics, it is common to classify systems according to the kind of degrees of freedom they have available, like electron (metals) or spin (magnetism). In crystals that can display the JTE, and before this effect is realised by symmetry-breaking distortions, it is found that there exists an orbital degree of freedom consisting of how electrons occupy the local degenerate orbitals. As initially discussed by Kugel and Khomskii,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Kugel
|first1=K. I.
|last2=Khomskii
|first2=D. I.
|year=1982

|volume=25
|issue=4
|pages=231–256
|doi=10.3367/UFNr.0136.198204c.0621
}}&lt;/ref&gt; not all configurations are equivalent. The key is the relative orientation of these occupied orbital, in the same way that spin orientation is important in magnetic systems, and the ground state can only be realised for some particular orbital pattern. Both this pattern and the effect giving rise to this phenomenon is usually denominated orbital-ordering.

In order to predict the orbital-ordering pattern, Kugel and Khomskii used a particularisation of the [[Hubbard model]]. In particular they established how [[superexchange]] interactions, usually described by the Anderson–Kanamori–Goodenough rules, change in the presence of degenerate orbitals. Their model, using a pseudospin representation for the local orbitals, leads to a [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|Heisenberg-like model]] in which the ground state is a combination of orbital and spin patterns. Using this model it can be shown, for example, that the origin of the unusual ground insulating [[ferromagnetic]] state of a solid like K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can be traced to its orbital ordering.

Even when starting from a relatively high-symmetry structure the combined effect of exchange interactions, spin-orbit coupling, orbital-ordering and crystal deformations activated by the JTE can lead to very low symmetry magnetic patterns with specific properties. For example, in CsCuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; an incommensurable helicoidal pattern appears both for the orbitals and the distortions along the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis. Moreover, many of these compounds show complex phase diagrams when varying temperature or pressure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3077">'''K-65 residues''' are the very [[radioactive]] mill residues resulting from a uniquely concentrated [[uranium]] [[ore]] discovered before [[World War II|WW II]] in [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] province ([[Shinkolobwe]]) of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly called the Belgian Congo).

According to Zoellner, "Remnants from typical uranium from the southwestern United States give a radioactive signature of about forty [[picocuries]] per gram, about ten times the amount of picocuries per liter of air that is considered safe for humans to breathe.  The Shinkolobwe remnants, by contrast, emit a stunning 520,000 picocuries per gram."  The [[Linde Air Products Company]] and Electro Metallurgical plant near Niagara built the ring-and-plug in [[Little Boy]].  Linde Air used the Lake Ontario Ordnance Works site at the end of the war to dispose of it atomic waste, cuttings from the African uranium, some 200 dump trucks worth.  The eventual location of all this waste is called the "Interim Waste Containment Structure" of the Niagara Falls Storage Site of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zoellner|first1=Tom|title=Uranium|date=2009|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=9780143116721|pages=289-294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ore, dubbed "K-65", had a record 65% uranium content. It also held very high concentrations of [[thorium]] and [[radium]] (and their decay products, including [[radon]] gas) which are retained in the tailings (residues). The very high concentrations of these extremely toxic, long-lived [[radionuclide]]s present in these wastes prompted the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]' [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] to categorize them as indistinguishable in hazard from High-Level Waste in its 1995 report, "Safety of the High-Level Uranium Ore Residues at the [[Niagara Falls Storage Site]], [[Lewiston, New York]]" [http://www.nap.edu/books/NX007126/html/]. 

The K-65 ores were refined as a key part of the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]] at the [[Linde Ceramics Plant]] at [[City of Tonawanda|Tonawanda, NY]], and at the [[Mallinckrodt Chemical Works]] in [[St. Louis, MO]]; these ores were the primary raw material source of ~80% of the uranium used in the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima bomb]]. The Mallinckrodt "K-65 residues" were later moved to the [[Fernald Feed Materials Production Center|Feed Materials Production Center]], a [[Cold War]] era uranium refinery at [[Fernald, OH]] (outside of [[Cincinnati]]) which commenced operations in 1951. The refining of "K-65" ore was continued at Fernald. The Linde "K-65 residues" were transported to a storage silo built at the federally appropriated [[Lake Ontario Ordnance Works]] site outside of Lewiston, NY, a short distance from [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls, NY]].

The '''Karot Hydropower Project''' is an under construction [[run-of-river]] concrete-core rockfill gravity dam in [[Pakistan]] with an installed capacity of 720 MW. The Karot Hydropower Station in Pakistan is the first investment project of the Silk Road Fund, is part of the much larger CPEC [[China–Pakistan Economic Corridor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silkroadfund.com.cn/enweb/23809/23812/23942/index.html |title=Q&amp;A about the Silk Road Fund's First Project Investment |accessdate=January 31, 2018 |date=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and is expected to be completed in 2020. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tiezzi|first1=Shannon|title=China Powers up Pakistan: The Commencement date of the project is December 01, 2016.

The Karot project is being developed by Karot Power Company comprising Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited, a subsidiary of [[China Three Gorges Corporation]], China-CTGC and Associated Technologies of Pakistan. It is the first hydropower project financed by China’s Silk Road Project.

After completion, the company will run and maintain the project for 30 years at a levelised tariff of 7.57 cents per unit after which it will be transferred to the Punjab government at a notional price of Rs.1.

==Background==
The Jhelum River is the largest river of Indus Basin River System, and its hydropower potential was identified by various studies carried out by international agencies, with the first report issued by the Canadian Consultant group MONENCO in 1983, followed by a 1994 study by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) that formally proposed the Karot Hydropower Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Punjab-EPA approves Karot Hydropower Project|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1166801|accessdate=13 March 2016|agency=Dawn|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The Karot Hydropower Project is planned on Jhelum River near Karot Village some 1.7 kilometers  upstream of Karot Bridge and 74&amp;nbsp;km upstream of [[Mangla Dam]]. The Project site is accessible through the road from Islamabad – Kahuta – Kotli Road approximately 29 kilometers from Kahuta village, and 65 kilometers from [[Islamabad]]. Groundbreaking on the project took place on January 10, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tiezzi|first1=Shannon|title=China Powers up Pakistan: The Energy Component of the CPEC|url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/01/china-powers-up-pakistan-the-energy-component-of-the-cpec/|accessdate=13 March 2016|agency=The Diplomat|date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project details==
The major project features include construction of concrete gravity 95.5 meters high dam with a crest length of 320 meters near the village of Gohra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Korot Power Company (Pvt) Ltd ("Company"), Application for Modification of the Generation License of 732 MW Karot Hydropower Project|url=http://www.nepra.org.pk/Licences/Licence%20Modification/2015/LPM%20of%20Karot%20Power%20Company.PDF|publisher=NEPRA|accessdate=13 March 2016|date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dam's reservoir will be approximately 164.5 million cubic meters in volume, with a length of 27 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.karotpower.com/cms/lib/downloadfiles/esia.pdf|url=http://www.karotpower.com/cms/lib/downloadfiles/esia.pdf|publisher=Karot Power|accessdate=13 March 2016|quote=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ifcext.ifc.org/IFCExt/spiwebsite1.nsf/651aeb16abd09c1f8525797d006976ba/71c155c3afc1de8d85257ea7007130ec?opendocument,&lt;/ref&gt; 72 homes and 58 businesses are expected to require relocation as a result of construction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.karotpower.com/cms/lib/downloadfiles/esia.pdf|url=http://www.karotpower.com/cms/lib/downloadfiles/esia.pdf|publisher=Karot Power|accessdate=13 March 2016|quote=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while 2.8 kilometers of the Karot-Kotli road, and 8.9 kilometers of the Azad Pattan-Kahuta road will need relocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.karotpower.com/cms/lib/downloadfiles/esia.pdf|url=http://www.karotpower.com/cms/lib/downloadfiles/esia.pdf|publisher=Karot Power|accessdate=13 March 2016|quote=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power intake structure will be constructed on right bank of the river immediately upstream of Dam site and will divert the water into headrace tunnels entering into Cavern Powerhouse. The water will be discharged back to River Jhelum through tail-race channel located at right bank of the River Jhelum immediately downstream of Karot village. The dam will generate mean annual energy 3,436 GWh, and will connect to Pakistan's national electricity grid.

On September 28, 2016, the federal and Azad Jammu and Kashmir governments signed an implementation agreement with a Chinese consortium for development and operation on river Jhelum at a levelised tariff of 7.57 cents per unit for 30 years.

Financial close of the project was achieved in February 2017 while land acquisition award has also been done. As of September 2017, roughly 25 per cent civil works of the project with installed capacity of 720 MW has already been completed.

SMEC International Pty Ltd is participating as Employer's Engineer, who is providing services for project management, design review and construction supervision for 720 MW Karot hydropower project

==Financing==
Total costs for the project are estimated to be $2 billion, and will be funded by International Finance Corporation, China's [[Silk Road Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poon|first1=Daniel|title=China’s partnerships could lead the way|url=http://www.policyforum.net/chinas-partnerships-could-lead-the-way/|publisher=Asia and the Pacific Policy Society|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Export-Import Bank of China]] and [[China Development Bank]] will issue loans to the Karot Power Company, which is a subsidiary of China's Three Gorges Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ingram|first1=Elizabeth|title=Karot in Pakistan to be first hydropower project financed by China’s Silk Road Fund|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/industry-news.html|accessdate=13 March 2016|agency=Hydroworld|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it will be built on a "Build-Own-Operate-Transfer" basis for 30 years, after which ownership will be turned over to the government of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Karot in Pakistan To Be First Hydropower Project Financed By International Finance Corporation, China’s Silk Road Fund|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2015/04/karot-in-pakistan-to-be-first-hydropower-project-financed-by-chinas-silk-road-fund.html|accessdate=13 March 2016|agency=Renewable Energy World|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''liquefied natural gas storage tank''' or LNG storage tank is a specialized type of storage tank used for the storage of [[Liquefied Natural Gas]]. LNG storage tanks can be found in ground, above ground or in [[LNG carrier]]s. The common characteristic of LNG Storage tanks is the ability to store LNG at the very low temperature of -162 °C (-260 °F). LNG storage tanks have double containers, where the inner contains LNG and the outer container contains insulation materials. The most common tank type is the full containment tank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhi.co.jp/ydmw/e/tank/lng/ag/index.htm Diagram of a full containment tank] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210082444/http://www.mhi.co.jp/ydmw/e/tank/lng/ag/index.htm |date=2005-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanks vary greatly in size, depending on usage.

In LNG storage the pressure and temperature within the tank will continue to rise. LNG is a [[cryogen]], and is kept in its liquid state at very low temperatures. The temperature within the tank will remain constant if the pressure is kept constant by allowing the [[Boiling point|boil off gas]] to escape from the tank. This is known as auto-refrigeration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.ca.gov/lng/faq.html#600 LNG FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's largest above-ground tank (Delivered in 2000) is the 180 million liters full containment type for Osaka Gas Co., Ltd.
(2) The world's largest tank (Delivered in 2001) is the 200 million liters Membrane type for Toho Gas Co., Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/tekken/e/lng_tank/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430015917/http://www.mhi.co.jp/tekken/e/lng_tank/index.htm |archivedate=2006-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31812">Ever since people have traveled the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]] storms have taken lives and vessels. The first sailing vessel on the upper lakes, the ''[[Le Griffon]]'', was lost on its return from [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]] in 1679. Since that time, memorable storms have swept the lakes, often in November taking men and ships to their death. With the advent of modern technology and sturdier vessels, fewer such losses have occurred.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{harvp|Havighurst|1966|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large expanse of the lakes allows waves to build to substantial heights and the open water can alter weather systems ([[fog]], [[lake effect snow]]). Storm winds can alter the lakes as well with large systems causing storm surges that lower lake levels several feet on one side while raising it even higher on the other. The shallowest lake, [[Lake Erie]], sometimes sees storm surge rises of 8 or 10 feet. [[Seiche]]s cause short-term irregular lake level changes, killing people swept off beaches and piers and even sometimes sinking boats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.msu.edu/geogmich/seiches.htm |title=Seiches on the Great Lakes |publisher=Geo.msu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great tolls caused by Great Lakes storms in 1868 and 1869 were one of the main reasons behind establishing a national [[weather forecasting]] service, initially run by the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]] using telegraphs to announce approaching storms in a few port cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/craft.weather.forcasting.history An Economic History of Weather Forecasting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503193324/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/craft.weather.forcasting.history |date=2007-05-03 }}, Erik D.

==Lake Erie Gale (1811)==
It was September 1811 and Jacob Butler was headed to [[Sandusky, Ohio]] as the new Indian Agent. When he arrived in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], he found it to be a small town of 40-50 houses and little activity. There were but a few ships in the harbor. The ''Catherine'' was a new schooner that had set sail the day before, but was now anchored nine miles up the Canadian shore at Point Ebenew. As it had set sail, it encountered a west forcing it to seek shelter. Seeing an opportunity to avoid the long trip around the lake, he crossed the [[Niagara River]] and with the help of a guide came upon the ship at anchor after two hours. Soon they were underway with a steady breeze pushing them towards Sandusky.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Varnum|1966|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was packed and every possible space in which a person could find repose was occupied. All night they traveled westward, the ship pushed by the wind and the schooner rocking from side to side. With so many people, so closely packed, many became nauseated. The next day, they traveled westward. As night fell on their second day of travel, they expected to see Sandusky in the morning. Everyone had just settled down for the night, when a commotion arose and a gale blew out of the southwest, nearly tipping the vessel over. If the schooner had not been ‘hove to’ and resting quietly, it would have been capsized.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Varnum|1966|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Without shore lights, lighthouse, or modern navigation equipment, Captains would ‘[[Heaving to|heave to]]’ at night if they anticipated approaching land/harbor soon. This prevented them from running aground in the dark.)

Quickly the crew made the ''Catherine'' ready for the storm and let her drift before the winds. As daylight came, the captain was able to get his ship behind [[Presque Isle State Park|Presque Isle]] ([[Erie, Pennsylvania]]), where they rode out the storm for the next 24 hours. The winds persisted so fiercely that everything on deck was swept clear. The crew and passengers remained below deck in the dark, their supply of food gone. On the fourth day of his journey, the gale ended and they were able to resupply from shore. Setting sail for Sandusky, the hope was to make harbor by dark. Once again a gale of lesser force sprang up and pushed the vessel back to Presque Isle. Here, many of the passengers left the ship and hired a wagon for the two-week overland trip. On their next attempt to reach Sandusky, the ''Catherine'' made harbor without incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Varnum|1966|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storm in the age of canoes (1825)==
It was September 1825 when [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]] recorded a late fall storm on [[Lake Huron]]. He was returning from an Indian ‘Congress’ at  [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]]. It had been an uneventful six-day trip from the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Michilimackinac]]. From Mackinac, Schoolcraft was headed towards Detour Pass and up the [[St. Marys River (Michigan-Ontario)|St. Mary's River]] to [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]]. On the morning of 5 September, he arose, had breakfast and prepared to strike out in their canoes. The day was cloudy and threatening, so he decided to wait until the next day. Arising at three in the morning, he found the island lost in a fog. They waited until it began to clear at 6:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and made their way to Goose Island, {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} distance after three hours. From there, they made their way to Outard Point. Here, the headwind had increased so they [[heaving to|hove to]] about noon and were able to pull into an inlet out of the wind and make camp. Eight hours later, the canoe party was still waiting for the wind to let up. The night brought a heavy rain, piercing the fabric of the tents, soaking everyone and everything. The morning of the 7th found the storm continuing. The increasing violence caused Schoolcraft to have his tent moved back into the trees for more protection. Around three, the sky seemed to be brightening and expectations were that the weather was clearing. But the rains and the wind came with renewed fury from the west and continued late into the night. As the morning of the 8th arrived, Schoolcraft determined to get on with his journey. As the wind was directly out of the west, he was headed east, he ordered the canoes readied and the sails. With sails [[Reefing|reefed]] against the storm, the brigade set out into the lake at 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Just under three and a half hours brought them 20 miles to the Isle St. Vital, behind which they took refuge from the wind. After a break, they once again set into the gale-force winds, driving for De Tour and the St. Mary’s Strait. Here they found the schooner ''Harriet'', down bound, waiting for the winds to subside. It was but another day and they were once again at Sault Ste. Marie.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Schoolcraft, ''Personal Memoirs of a Residence of Thirty Years with the Indians Tribes on the American Frontiers'', 1851&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Havighurst|1966|pp=302–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early steam on the Lakes (1835)==
On November 11, 1835, a southwest wind swept across the lakes, taking numerous vessels. This was still early in the life of commercial shipping on the Lakes, so most of the losses were on the lower lakes where settlements were greatest.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mansfield"&gt;J.B. Mansfield, ''History of the Great Lakes'', 1899&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] was a major port on [[Lake Erie]] and felt the force of the storm as water from the lake forced ships onto the piers and shoreline of the city. The creek rose 20 feet as the wind and the harbor front were swept away.

{{see also|Mataafa Storm}}

The Mataafa Storm of 1905 is the name of a storm that occurred on the [[Great Lakes]] on November 27–28, 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duluthport.com/99fall/famous.html Duluth Seaway Port Authority, Minnesota] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608004410/http://www.duluthport.com/99fall/famous.html |date=June 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system moved across the Great Basin with moderate depth on November 26 and November 27, then east-northeastward across the Great Lakes on November 28. Fresh east winds were forecast for the Great Lakes for the afternoon and evening of November 27,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Daily Weather Map Series|title=1905-11-27|publisher=United States Weather Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; with storm warnings were in effect by the morning of November 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Daily Weather Map Series|title=1905-11-28|publisher=United States Weather Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Storm-force winds and heavy snows accompanied the cyclone's passage. The storm, named after the [[SS Mataafa|Mataafa wreck]], ended up destroying or damaging about 29 vessels, killing 36 seamen and causing shipping losses of $3.567&amp;nbsp;million (1905 dollars) on Lake Superior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWjpAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR31&amp;lpg=PR31&amp;dq=november+28,+1905+great+lakes+storm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IYyZHOd8ZZ&amp;sig=dsTuOqPB-UgbARdrb2BUObhzDCw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5E1tU-GiIsuqyAT93IGQCQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=november%2028%2C%201905%20great%20lakes%20storm&amp;f=false|page=4|title=Report For November 1905: Michigan Section of the Climate and Crop Service of the Weather Bureau in Cooperation With the Michigan State Weather Service|author=C.

==The Big Storm (1913)==
{{main article| Great Lakes Storm of 1913}}
In 1913, from the ninth of November through the twelfth, all five lakes were turned into cauldrons of rolling water by a unique combination of weather patterns. Before the four days ended, 13 ships went under and many more were driven ashore. Two hundred forty-four men lost their lives. The largest loss of ships was on Lake Huron (see [[Lake Huron#Shipwrecks|Shipwrecks of Lake Huron]])

== Black Friday (1916) ==
[[File:Surface Map from Saturday October 21 1916 following Black Friday.png|thumb|The surface map from Saturday, October 21, 1916 with the track of [[1916 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Fourteen|1916 Atlantic hurricane 14]].]]
Friday, October 20, 1916 on [[Lake Erie]]. These were the years before there was ship to shore radio. Once out on the lakes, each ship had only itself to depend upon and the chance of meeting another ship. While only four ships were lost, nearly all the men of these crews were lost to the tempest of the storm-tossed lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bowen|1940|loc=Chapter 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, Black Friday took the lives of 49 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bowen|1940|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[James B. Colgate (ship)|''James B. Colgate'']] had just finished loading coal and set sail from [[Buffalo, New York]] bound for [[Fort William, Ontario]] (now [[Thunder Bay]]). It was 1:10 in the morning as the ''Colgate'' dropped its [[hawser]]s and headed out into the open lake. Dawn found the ''Colgate'' off Long Point. All day they moved steadily westward, keeping the bow into the wind, waves crashing over the decks and beating on the hatch coverings. Slowing, water began to enter the cargo holds. The pumps could not keep up with the influx of water and she began to list at about eight o'clock that evening. No other ships had been seen and none could be found. The bow was riding low in the water. As the ten o'clock hour came around, the ''Colgate'' slid beneath the waves. The men all had life jackets, but nothing was floating which would help them get out of the cold water. One life raft was found and a coal passer, the engineer and the captain took refuge. In the middle of the night, the raft was flipped and the coal passer did not return. As the 21st dawned, the raft again spilled its occupants and the engineer returned but was too weak to hold on and he was lost. Night came on and Captain Walter J. Grashaw still hung on to the raft. A passenger steamer passed nearby, but he was unnoticed in the dark. As daylight dawned on the 22nd, Sunday, the Marquette &amp; Bessemer No. 2 (II) came to his rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bowen|1940|pp=209–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Marshall F. Butters'', a wooden lumber carrier down bound to [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] with a cargo of shingles and lumber, entered [[Lake Erie]] from the [[Detroit River]]. The wind rose and the waves grew in height. The ''Butters'' turned into Lake Erie heading towards the Southeast Shoals Light, off the tip of [[Point Pelee]]. The wooden ship could not take the pounding of the waves. Settling into the lake, soon the boilers were extinguished and the ''Butters'' was at the mercy of the storm. Ten men set sail in the lifeboat, leaving only the captain and two men on board the sinking vessel. The Pioneer Steamship Company’s ''Frank R. Billings'' and the ''F.G. Hartwell'' were nearby. The ''Billings'' approached to give aid. Pouring [[storm oil]] on the water, they were able to calm the seas enough to rescue Captain McClure and his two men. Meanwhile, the ''Hartwell'' rescued the men in the lifeboat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bowen|1940|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third ship the ''D.L. Filer'', a wooden [[schooner]] of 45 years, was headed from Buffalo to [[Saugatuck, Michigan]] with a load of coal. For two days, the ''Filer'' beat into the wind headed for the [[Detroit River]] at the western end of Lake Erie. Just off Bar Point, within sight of the mouth of the Detroit River, the pumps could no longer move the volume of water rushing into the holds, and the seams began to open. In eighteen feet of water, she settled to the bottom. Six men climbed the foremast, while the captain climbed the after mast. It looked like all seven of the crew could cling to the mast and weather the night. But the weight of six men snapped the fore mast and five disappeared. Only one man made it to the after mast and climbed to safety. As dawn broke the horizon, the ''Western States'' came into sight and turned towards the two men clinging to the mast protruding from the shallows. As the steamer approached, one man slipped from the mast and was never seen again. Only the Captain John Mattison was rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bowen|1940|pp=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Canadian steamer ''Merida'' disappeared that night. All 23 of her crew were found the next day floating in mid-lake, only identified by their life vests bearing the name ''Merida''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bowen|1940|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armistice Day blizzard (1940)==
{{Main article|1940 Armistice Day Blizzard}}
[[File:Armistice Day Blizzard surface map.jpg|thumb|Armistice Day Blizzard surface map.]]
The Armistice Day Blizzard was a winter storm that occurred on November 11–12, 1940 which brought heavy snow and winds up to 80&amp;nbsp;mph. The [[lake freighter]] [[SS William B. Davock|SS ''William B. Davock'']] sank with all 33 hands in Lake Michigan south of [[Pentwater, Michigan]]. The [[SS Anna C. Minch |SS ''Anna C. Minch'']] foundered, broke in two and sank nearby with the loss of all 24 crew. A third ship, the [[SS Novadoc|SS ''Novadoc'']], wrecked on a reef in the same area. Two crew were lost and the rest were rescued two days later by the tug ''Three Brothers''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boatnerd.com/swayze/shipwreck/n.htm Great Lakes Shipwreck file], David D. Swayze&lt;/ref&gt; Two smaller boats also sank, bringing the total death toll on the Lakes to 66.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/200011/10_steilm_blizzard-m The Winds of Hell], Mark Steil, Minnesota Public Radio, November 10, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duluth Storm (1967)==
[[File:Surface map 1 AM EST April 30 1967.png|thumb|Surface map showing the situation at 1 AM EST, April 30, 1967.]]
{{Main article|1967 Southern Minnesota tornado outbreak}}
On April 30, 1967, a storm in [[Duluth, Minnesota]] took the lives of three teenage boys and Coast Guardsman [[Edgar Culbertson]]. Culbertson and two others were part of a rescue team searching for the missing boys on the Duluth Entry pier on [[Lake Superior]]. Meteorologists and Minnesota residents often refer to this day as "Black Sunday". There were reports of heavy rain as far north as Duluth that day. The waves on Lake Superior in Duluth that night were reportedly over {{convert|20|ft|m}} high at times; the lake had {{convert|36|F|C}} water with gale-force winds gusting up to {{convert|45|mph|kph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.uscg.mil/history/people/CulbertsonEdgar.pdf |title= Boatswain Mate First Class (BM1) Edgar Culbertson, USCG  |website= USCG History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald (1975) ==
[[File:Weather Map from November 10 1975 Edmund Fitzgerald Storm.png|thumb|Surface map from November 10, 1975.]]
{{Main article|SS Edmund Fitzgerald}}
Once again it was a November storm that took the lives of men and their ship. It was November 9, 1975 that ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' was downbound to [[Detroit]] with a load of [[taconite]]. ''Arthur M. Anderson'' joined her on Lake Superior and was downbound for [[Gary, Indiana]]. As they were crossing Lake Superior the winter storm blew in. Winds were reported in excess of {{convert|50|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} with waves running up to {{convert|35|ft|m}}. The next day, Monday, November 10, eastern Lake Superior was still experiencing winds of 50 knots (57.5 mph). That afternoon ''Anderson'' reported being hit by a 75-knot gust (86.3 mph). By 3:30 pm the ''Fitzgerald'' reported a minor list and top-side damage, including the loss of radar.  ''Fitzgerald'' was leading, but slowed to close the distance between ships so that it could be guided by ''Anderson'', who still had radar. Just after seven that night, the last radio contact from the ''Fitzgerald'' said that they were still managing. By 7:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. there was no more contact and ''Anderson'' no longer saw ''Fitzgerald'' on radar.&lt;ref&gt;[[SS Edmund Fitzgerald]]{{Circular reference|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fitzgerald'' sank in Canadian waters {{convert|530|ft|m}} deep, approximately 17 miles (15 nautical miles; 27 kilometers) from the entrance to Whitefish Bay near the twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Although ''Fitzgerald'' had reported being in difficulty earlier, no distress signals were sent before she sank. Her crew of 29 all perished, and no bodies were recovered.

Many theories, books, studies and expeditions have examined the cause of the sinking. ''Fitzgerald'' may have fallen victim to the high waves of the storm, suffered structural failure, been swamped with water entering through her cargo hatches or deck, experienced topside damage, or shoaled in a shallow part of Lake Superior. The sinking of ''Edmund Fitzgerald'' is one of the best-known disasters in the history of Great Lakes shipping. Gordon Lightfoot made it the subject of his 1976 hit song "[[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald]]".

==The Lake Huron Cyclone (1996)==
{{Main article|1996 Lake Huron cyclone}}
The 1996 Lake Huron cyclone was a unique storm for the Great Lakes, acquiring some tropical characteristics at its peak intensity.

==Northeastern Ontario Derecho (2006))==
{{Main article|Heat wave of 2006 derecho series}}

The 2006 Northeastern Ontario Derecho formed on the Great Lakes. The Storm caused damage throughout Northern Ontario, and into Quebec.

==The "Chiclone" (2010)==
{{Main article|October 2010 North American storm complex}}
On October 26, 2010, the USA recorded its lowest pressure ever in a continental, non-hurricane system, though its pressure was consistent with a category three hurricane. The powerful system was dubbed the "Chiclone" by the media as it hit the Chicago area particularly strongly, as well as Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. It was also meteorologically referred to as a bombogenesis due to the rapid drop of barometric pressure experienced.

In Superior, Wisconsin, the storm managed a 28.38 inch reading&amp;mdash;a new all-time low for Wisconsin at the time. Near International Falls on the U.S./Canada border, the system's {{convert|28.23|inHg|mb}} reading established a new all-time Minnesota low pressure. Early Tuesday morning October 26, an F2 tornado rushed through Will County, south of Chicago, at 7:00 AM. Another tornado is said to have struck Racine, Wisconsin, to the north, but has not yet been confirmed. In Roscoe, IL, about 100 miles to the west of Chicago and 15 minutes north of Rockford, a woman was killed after being crushed under a large tree that fell in her neighborhood of Chickory Ridge.

The storm also produced some of the highest officially recorded waves by weather buoys stationed in Lakes Superior and Michigan. Specifically, on Wednesday, October 27, 2010, buoy no. 45136, operated by Environment Canada, in northern Lake Superior recorded a significant wave height of 26.6 feet (this is average height of 1/3 of the highest waves over an hour), and buoy no. 45002, operated by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC), recorded a significant wave height of 21.7 feet in northern Lake Michigan. This would appear consistent with the NOAA forecast for northern Lake Michigan calling for 21–26-foot waves that day. The persistence and strength of the storm's westerly winds also piled the waters of Lake Michigan along the Michigan shoreline leading to declines in lake levels on the Illinois and Wisconsin side of the lake. Based on NOAA lake level sensors, an updated analysis of Wednesday, October 27, 2010 water levels on Lake Michigan revealed a two-day decrease of 42 inches at Green Bay, WI and 19 inches at Calumet Harbor, IL---while NOAA sensors at Ludington, MI and Mackinaw City, MI measured lake level rises of 7 and 19 inches respectively.

A 78&amp;nbsp;mph gust was recorded the afternoon of October 27, 2010 at the Harrison-Dever Crib, three miles offshore of Chicago in Lake Michigan, with gusts reaching 63&amp;nbsp;mph at Chicago's Latin School and in Racine, Wisconsin, 61&amp;nbsp;mph at Buffalo Grove, Waukegan, Gary and Monroe, Wisconsin and 58&amp;nbsp;mph at Hinsdale. The storm further whitened sections of the Upper Midwest with the region's first significant snow Tuesday night and Wednesday. Snowfall reports from Minnesota and North Dakota indicate 9 inches fell at Twig, Minn.; 8.5 inches at Dunn Center, N.D.; 8 inches at Adolph, Minn. and Carrington, N.D.; 7.7 inches at Duluth; 4.1 inches Williston; 4 inches at Minot and 3.4 inches at Bismarck---all in North Dakota.

==Superstorm Sandy (2012)==
The cold front that merged with [[Hurricane Sandy]] at the end of October 2012 fueled Sandy's transition into a powerful [[extratropical cyclone]], which brought strong winds and high waves across the Great Lakes. Lake Michigan recorded wave heights of 20 to 22 feet and wind gusts of 60 to 70&amp;nbsp;mph. The southern end of Lake Michigan experienced a lake level rise of 15 inches as the winds pushed water down the lake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/updraft/archive/2012/10/sandy_spins_on_great_lakes_win.shtml Sandy spins on; Winds push Great Lakes waves to near record levels], MPRNews, Paul Huttner, October 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weather.com/news/weather-hurricanes/sandy-great-lakes-waves-20121029 Sandy Brings High Waves, Floods to Great Lakes], The Weather Channel, Nov 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Lake Huron experienced 23-foot waves and a wind gust of 74&amp;nbsp;mph was recorded at Fort Gratiot at the southern end of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/article/20121030/NEWS05/121030005/80-000-in-metro-Detroit-without-power-as-high-winds-sweep-through-region About 80,000 without power in Metro Detroit after Superstorm Sandy], ''Detroit Free Press'', October 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Most freighters stayed in harbor instead of trying to run through the storm.

== The Lake Michigan Storm of Halloween 2014==

On October 31, 2014, there was a powerful storm which impacted the Great Lakes area during times when people are traditionally celebrating Halloween.&lt;ref name="mlive1114"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Recap of Michigan's Halloween wind and snow storm | author = Torregrossa, Mark | work = MLive.com | date = November 1, 2014 | accessdate = 2016-01-25 | url = http://www.mlive.com/weather/index.ssf/2014/11/recap_of_michigans_halloween_w.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also called a "great storm".

[[File:Balclutha main topgallant mast.jpg|150px|thumb|upright|Main topgallant mast]]
The '''mast''' of a [[Sailing ship|sailing vessel]] is a tall [[spar (sailing)|spar]], or arrangement of spars, erected more or less vertically on the centre-line of a ship or boat. Its purposes include carrying [[sail]], spars, and [[derrick]]s, and giving necessary height to a [[navigation light]], [[Look-out|look-out position]], [[Naval flag signalling|signal]] [[Yard (sailing)|yard]], [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|control position]], [[Antenna (radio)|radio aerial]] or [[signal lamp]].&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Cyril Walter Thomas, Peter Clissold, and A. G. W. Miller. Dictionary of nautical words and terms. Brown, Son &amp; Ferguson, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Large ships have several masts, with the size and configuration depending on the style of ship. Nearly all sailing masts are [[guyed mast|guyed]].&lt;ref&gt;Harland, John. ''Seamanship in the Age of Sail,'' pp. 22-5, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 1992. {{ISBN|0-87021-955-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-19th century all vessels' masts were made of wood formed from a single or several pieces of timber which typically consisted of the trunk of a [[conifer]] tree. From the 16th century, vessels were often built of a size requiring masts taller and thicker than could be made from single tree trunks. On these larger vessels, to achieve the required height, the masts were built from up to four sections (also called masts), known in order of rising height above the decks as the lower, top, topgallant and royal masts.&lt;ref name=poa&gt;{{cite book |last=Keegan |first=John |authorlink =John Keegan |title =The Price of Admiralty |publisher =Viking |volume = |edition = |date =1989 |location =New York |pages =278&amp;281 |isbn =0-670-81416-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving the lower sections sufficient thickness necessitated building them up from separate pieces of wood. Such a section was known as a made mast, as opposed to sections formed from single pieces of timber, which were known as pole masts.

==Nomenclature==
For [[square sail|square-sail]] carrying [[full rigged ship|ship]], the masts, given their standard names in [[Bow (ship)|bow]] to [[stern]] (front to back) order, are:
* ''[[Sprit topmast]]'': a small mast set on the end of the [[bowsprit]] (discontinued after the early 18th century); not usually counted as a mast, however, when identifying a ship as "two masted" or "three masted"
* ''Fore-mast'': the mast nearest the bow, or the mast forward of the main-mast&lt;ref name=poa/&gt;
** Sections: fore-mast lower—fore topmast—fore topgallant mast
* ''Main-mast'': the tallest mast, usually located near the center of the ship
** Sections: main-mast lower—main topmast—main topgallant mast—royal mast (if fitted)
* {{anchor|mizzen mast}}''Mizzen-mast'': the aft-most mast. Typically shorter than the fore-mast.
** Sections: mizzen-mast lower—mizzen topmast—mizzen topgallant mast&lt;ref&gt;Harland, John. ''Seamanship in the Age of Sail,'' pp. 15, 19-22, 36-37, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 1992. {{ISBN|0-87021-955-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some names given to masts in [[full rigged ship|ships]] carrying other types of rig (where the naming is less standardised) are:  
* ''Bonaventure mizzen'': the fourth mast on larger sixteenth century galleons, typically [[lateen]]-rigged and shorter than the main mizzen.
* ''Jigger-mast'': typically, where it is the shortest, the aftmost mast on vessels with more than three masts.
** Sections: jigger-mast lower—jigger topmast—jigger topgallant mast

[[File:Balclutha_ship.jpg|150px|thumb|left|This photo of the full-rigged ship ''[[Balclutha (1886)|Balclutha]]'', shows the fore-mast, main-mast and mizzen-mast, as well as all the ship's standing and running rigging. The Balclutha is berthed in [[San Francisco]], and is open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Harland, John. ''Seamanship in the Age of Sail,'' pp. 15, 19, 36-37, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, Maryland, 1992. {{ISBN|0-87021-955-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Dana T. ''Square Riggers in the United States and Canada,'' pp. 55, Transportation Trails, Polo, Illinois, 1994. {{ISBN|0-933449-19-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Most types of vessels with two masts are supposed to have a main-mast and a smaller mizzen-mast, although both [[brig]]s and two-masted [[schooner]]s carry a fore-mast and a main-mast instead. On a two-masted vessel with the main-mast forward and a much smaller second mast, such as a [[ketch]], or particularly a [[yawl]], the terms ''mizzen'' and ''jigger'' are synonymous.&lt;ref name=oct&gt;{{cite book |last=Torrey |first=Owen C., Jr. |authorlink = |title =Sails |publisher =Palmer &amp; Oliver |volume = |edition =Seamen's Bank for Savings |date =1965 |location =New York |pages =38&amp;39 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although two-masted schooners may be provided with masts of identical size, the aftmost is still referred to as the main-mast, and normally has the larger [[course (sail)|course]]. Schooners have been built with up to seven masts in all, with several six-masted examples.

== History ==

[[File:Romtrireme.jpg|thumb|[[Roman navy|Roman]] two-masted [[trireme]], its foremast showing a typically strong forward rake]]

In the West, the concept of a ship carrying more than one mast, to give it more speed under sail and to improve its sailing qualities, evolved in northern [[Mediterranean]] waters: The earliest foremast has been identified on an [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] [[Pyxis (vessel)|pyxis]] from [[Caere]], [[Italy]], dating to the mid-7th century BC: a warship with a furled [[mainsail]] is engaging an enemy vessel, deploying a [[foresail]].&lt;ref&gt;Turfa, J. MacIntosh; Steinmayer, A. G. (1999): "The Earliest Foresail, on Another Etruscan Vase", ''[[The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology]]'', Vol. 28, No. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;292–296 (295)&lt;/ref&gt; A two-masted [[merchant vessel]] with a sizable foresail rigged on a slightly inclined foremast is depicted in an Etruscan [[tomb]] painting from 475–450 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lionel Casson|Casson, Lionel]] (1963): "The Earliest Two-masted Ship", ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;108–111 (111)&lt;/ref&gt; An ''artemon'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for foresail) almost the same size as the [[galley]]'s mainsail can be found on a [[Corinth]]ian [[krater]] as early as the late 6th century BC; apart from that [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] longships are uniformly shown without it until the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name="Casson 1980, 69"&gt;[[Lionel Casson|Casson, Lionel]] (1980): "Two-masted Greek ships", ''[[The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology]]'', Vol. 9, No. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;68–69 (69)&lt;/ref&gt;

The foremast became fairly common on [[Roman navy|Roman galleys]], where, inclined at an angle of 45°, it was more akin to a [[bowsprit]], and the foresail set on it, reduced in size, seems to be used rather as an aid to steering than for propulsion.&lt;ref name="Casson 1980, 69"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lionel Casson|Casson, Lionel]] (1963): "The Earliest Two-masted Ship", ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;108–111 (109)&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the ancient evidence is iconographic, the existence of foremasts can also be deduced [[Underwater archaeology|archaeologically]] from slots in foremast-feets located too close to the [[prow]] for a mainsail.&lt;ref&gt;Beltrame, Carlo (1996): "Archaeological Evidence of the Foremast on Ancient Sailing Ships", ''[[The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology]]'', Vol. 25, No. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;135–139 (135)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corbita BM GR1850.3-4.32.jpg|thumb|left|Roman merchantman (''corbita'') with mainmast and foremast under sail]]

''Artemon'', along with mainsail and [[topsail]], developed into the standard rig of seagoing vessels in [[Roman empire|imperial times]], complemented by a [[mizzen]] on the largest freighters.&lt;ref name="Casson 1995, 239–243"&gt;[[Lionel Casson|Casson, Lionel]] (1995): "Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World", Johns Hopkins University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5130-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;239–243&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded three-masters were the giant ''[[Syracusia]]'', a prestige object commissioned by king [[Hiero II of Syracuse]] and devised by the polymath [[Archimedes]] around 240 BC, and other [[Syracusan]] merchant ships of the time.&lt;ref name="Casson 1995, 242, fn. 75"&gt;[[Lionel Casson|Casson, Lionel]] (1995): "Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World", Johns Hopkins University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5130-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;242, fn.&amp;nbsp;75&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial grain freighters travelling the routes between [[Alexandria]] and [[Rome]] also included three-masted vessels.&lt;ref name="Casson 1995, 242, fn. 75"/&gt; A mosaic in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] (c. 200&amp;nbsp;AD) depicts a freighter with a three-masted rig entering Rome's harbour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lionel Casson|Casson, Lionel]] (1995): "Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World", Johns Hopkins University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5130-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;XXIV, picture 145&lt;/ref&gt; Special craft could carry many more masts: [[Theophrastus]] (''Hist. Plant.'' 5.8.2) records how the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] imported [[Corsica]]n timber by way of a huge [[Timber rafting|raft]] propelled by as many as fifty masts and sails.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lionel Casson|Casson, Lionel]] (1995): "Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World", Johns Hopkins University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5130-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;4, fn.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lorenzo Costa 001.jpg|thumb|[[Renaissance]] three-master by [[Lorenzo Costa]]]]

Throughout [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], both foresail and mizzen remained secondary in terms of canvas size, although large enough to require full [[running rigging]].&lt;ref name="Casson 1995, 239–243"/&gt; In [[late antiquity]], the foremast lost most of its tilt, standing nearly upright on some ships.&lt;ref name="Casson 1995, 239–243"/&gt;

By the onset of the [[Early Middle Ages]], rigging had undergone a fundamental transformation in Mediterranean navigation: the [[lateen]] which had long evolved on smaller [[Greco-Roman]] craft replaced the [[square rig]], the chief sail type of the ancients, that practically disappeared from the record until the 14th century (while it remained dominant in northern Europe).&lt;ref&gt;[[Lionel Casson|Casson, Lionel]] (1995): "Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World", Johns Hopkins University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5130-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;243–245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, John H.; Jeffreys, Elizabeth M. (2006): "The Age of the ΔΡΟΜΩΝ. The Byzantine Navy ca. 500–1204", The Medieval Mediterranean. Peoples, Economies and Cultures, 400–1500, Vol. 62, Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|978-90-04-15197-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;153–161&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dromon]], the lateen-rigged and oared [[bireme]] of the [[Byzantine navy]], almost certainly had two masts, a larger foremast and one midships. Their length has been estimated at about 12&amp;nbsp;m and 8&amp;nbsp;m respectively, somewhat smaller than the [[Charles I of Naples|Sicilian]] war galleys of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, John H.; Jeffreys, Elizabeth M. (2006): "The Age of the ΔΡΟΜΩΝ. The Byzantine Navy ca. 500–1204", The Medieval Mediterranean. Peoples, Economies and Cultures, 400–1500, Vol. 62, Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|978-90-04-15197-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;238f., 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple-masted ''sailing'' ships were reintroduced into the Mediterranean Sea by the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Large vessels were coming more and more into use and the need for additional masts to control these ships adequately grew with the increase in tonnage. Unlike in antiquity, the mizzen-mast was adopted on medieval two-masters earlier than the foremast, a process which can be traced back by pictorial evidence from [[Venice]] and [[Barcelona]] to the mid-14th century. To balance out the sail plan the next obvious step was to add a mast fore of the main-mast, which first appears in a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] ink drawing from 1409. With the three-masted ship established, propelled by square rig and lateen, and guided by the [[pintle]]-and-[[gudgeon]] [[rudder]], all advanced ship design technology necessary for the [[Age of discovery|great transoceanic voyages]] was in place by the beginning of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mott, Lawrence V. (1994): "A Three-masted Ship Depiction from 1409", ''[[The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology]]'', Vol. 23, No. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hollow masts ==

The first hollow mast was fitted on the American sloop Maria in 1845, 92 feet long and built of staves bound with iron hoops like a barrel. Other hollow masts were made from two tapered timbers hollowed and glued together.&lt;ref name="rry"/&gt; Nearly a century later, the simple box form of mast{{clarify|date=June 2015}} was arrived at.&lt;ref name="rry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Philips-Birt |first=Douglas |title=Rigs and Rigging of Yachts |year=1954 |publisher=W&amp;J Mackay &amp; Co. Ltd. |pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern masts ==

[[Image:Mast Stars and Stripes.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Mast of the sailing yacht ''Stars and Stripes'', with [[shroud (sailing)|shrouds]] held apart by multiple [[spreader (sailboat)|spreaders]]]]
Although sailing ships were superseded by engine-powered ships in the 19th century, recreational sailing ships and yachts continue to be designed and constructed.

In the 1930s aluminium masts were introduced on large  [[J-class yacht]]s. An aluminium mast has considerable advantages over a wooden one: it is lighter and slimmer than a wooden one of the same strength, is impervious to rot, and can be produced as a single extruded length. During the 1960s wood was eclipsed by aluminium. Aluminium alloys, generally 6000 series, are commonly utilised.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, R., et al. "SAILING YACHT DESIGN." (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently some sailing yachts (particularly home-built yachts) have begun to use steel masts. Whilst somewhat heavier than aluminium, steel has its own set of advantages. It is significantly cheaper, and a steel mast of an equivalent strength can be smaller in diameter than an aluminium mast, allowing less turbulence and a better airflow onto the sail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schinas|first=Jill|title=Build your own steel masts|url=http://www.yachtmollymawk.com/2013/07/build-your-own-steel-masts/|publisher=Yacht Mollymawk|accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dix|first=Dudley|title=Dudley Dix Yacht Design FAQ - Steel Boats|url=http://www.dixdesign.com/FAQsteel.htm|accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Masts.svg|left|200px|thumb|Illustration of modern mast and wing-mast cross-sections, with sail]]
From the mid-1990s racing yachts introduced the use of [[carbon fibre]] and other [[composite material]]s to construct masts with even better strength-to-weight ratios. Carbon fibre masts could also be constructed with more precisely engineered aerodynamic profiles.

Modern masts form the leading edge of a sail's [[airfoil]] and tend to have a teardrop-shaped cross-section.  On smaller racing yachts and catamarans, the mast rotates to the optimum angle for the sail's 
airfoil.  If the mast has a long, thin cross-section and makes up a significant area of the airfoil, it is called a wing-mast; boats using these have a smaller sail area to compensate for the larger mast area. There are many manufacturers of modern masts for sailing yachts of all sizes, a few notable companies are Hall Spars, [[Offshore Spars]], and Southern Spars.

[[File:Mast zelikvor.jpg|250px|thumb|Sails on a small ship as seen from below]]
After the end of the [[age of sail]], warships retained masts, initially as observation posts and to observe [[fall of shot]], also holding fire control equipment such as [[rangefinder]]s, and later as a mounting point for [[radar]] and [[telecommunication]] antennas, which need to be mounted high up to increase range. Simple pole, [[Lattice mast|lattice]], and [[tripod mast]]s have been used—also, on some past Japanese warships, complex [[pagoda mast]]s.

The [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of '''materials science''', also commonly termed '''materials science and engineering''' is the design and discovery of new materials, particularly [[solid]]s. The intellectual origins of materials science stem from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when researchers began to use analytical thinking from [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]] to understand ancient, [[Empirical relationship|phenomenological]] observations in [[metallurgy]] and [[mineralogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Eddy|first1= Matthew Daniel|title= The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750–1800|date= 2008|publisher= Ashgate|url= https://www.academia.edu/1112014|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150903230852/http://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_|archivedate= 2015-09-03|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Cyril Stanley |authorlink= Cyril Stanley Smith |title= A Search for Structure |date= 1981 |publisher= MIT Press |isbn= 978-0262191913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials science still incorporates elements of physics, chemistry, and engineering. As such, the field was long considered by academic institutions as a sub-field of these related fields. Beginning in the 1940s, materials science began to be more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering, and major technical universities around the world created dedicated schools of the study, within either the Science or Engineering schools, hence the naming. 
:Materials science is a syncretic discipline hybridizing metallurgy, ceramics, solid-state physics, and chemistry. It is the first example of a new academic discipline emerging by fusion rather than fission.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rustum Roy]] (1979) interdisciplinary science on campus, pages 161–96 in ''Interdisciplinarity and Higher Education'', J.J. Kockelmans editor, [[Pennsylvania State University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of the most pressing scientific problems humans currently face are due to the limits of the materials that are available and how they are used. Thus, breakthroughs in materials science are likely to affect the future of technology significantly.&lt;ref name=BESAC2008&gt;{{Cite report |last= Hemminger |first= John C. |date= August 2010 |title= Science for Energy Technology: Strengthening the Link between Basic Research and Industry |url= http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |publisher= United States Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee |accessdate= 3 August 2018 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150821010038/http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |archivedate= 2015-08-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carbcap&gt;{{Cite report |last1= Alivisatos |first1= Paul |last2= Buchanan |first2= Michelle |date= March 2010 |title= Basic Research Needs for Carbon Capture: Beyond 2020 |url= http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |publisher= United States Department of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee |accessdate= 3 August 2018 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150821010038/http://science.energy.gov/bes/news-and-resources/reports/ |archivedate= 2015-08-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material (its ''processing'') influences its structure, and thus the material's properties and performance. The understanding of processing-structure-properties relationships is called the {{Section link||materials paradigm}}. This paradigm is used to advance understanding in a variety of research areas, including [[nanotechnology]], [[biomaterial]]s, and metallurgy. Materials science is also an important part of [[forensic engineering]] and [[failure analysis]] – investigating materials, products, structures or components which fail or do not function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. Such investigations are key to understanding, for example, the causes of various [[aviation accidents and incidents]].

==History==
{{Main|History of materials science}}
[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A late [[Bronze Age sword]] or dagger blade.]]
The material of choice of a given era is often a defining point. Phrases such as [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], and [[Industrial Revolution|Steel Age]] are historic, if arbitrary examples. Originally deriving from the manufacture of [[ceramic]]s and its putative derivative metallurgy, materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science. Modern materials science evolved directly from [[metallurgy]], which itself evolved from mining and (likely) ceramics and earlier from the use of fire. A major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century, when the American scientist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] demonstrated that the [[thermodynamic]] properties related to [[atom]]ic structure in various [[phase (matter)|phases]] are related to the physical properties of a material. Important elements of modern materials science are a product of the [[space race]]: the understanding and [[engineering]] of the metallic [[alloy]]s, and [[silica]] and [[carbon]] materials, used in building space vehicles enabling the exploration of space. Materials science has driven, and been driven by, the development of revolutionary technologies such as [[rubber]]s, [[plastic]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[biomaterial]]s.

Before the 1960s (and in some cases decades after), many ''materials science'' departments were named ''metallurgy'' departments, reflecting the 19th and early 20th century emphasis on metals. The growth of materials science in the United States was catalyzed in part by the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]], which funded a series of university-hosted laboratories in the early 1960s "to expand the national program of basic research and training in the materials sciences."&lt;ref name=martin-pip&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Joseph D. |title=What's in a Name Change?

The prominent change in materials science during the last two decades is active usage of computer simulation methods to find new compounds, predict various properties.

[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The materials paradigm represented in the form of a tetrahedron.]]
A material is defined as a substance (most often a solid, but other condensed phases can be included) that is intended to be used for certain applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nmat/authors/index.html "For Authors: Nature Materials"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801234616/http://www.nature.com/nmat/authors/index.html |date=2010-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a myriad of materials around us—they can be found in anything from buildings to spacecraft. Materials can generally be further divided into two classes: [[crystal]]line and [[amorphous|non-crystalline]]. The traditional examples of materials are [[metal]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, [[ceramic]]s and [[polymer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Callister, Jr.,  Rethwisch. "Materials Science and Engineering – An Introduction" (8th ed.). John Wiley and Sons, 2009 p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt; New and advanced materials that are being developed include [[nanomaterials]], [[biomaterial]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Callister, Jr.,  Rethwisch. Materials Science and Engineering – An Introduction (8th ed.). John Wiley and Sons, 2009 p.10-12&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Photovoltaic cell|energy materials]] to name a few.
 
The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[Material properties|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a given application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

===Structure===
As mentioned above, structure is one of the most important components of the field of materials science. Materials science examines the structure of materials from the atomic scale, all the way up to the macro scale. [[Characterization (materials science)|Characterization]] is the way materials scientists examine the structure of a material. This involves methods such as diffraction with [[X-ray]]s, [[electron]]s, or [[neutron]]s, and various forms of [[spectroscopy]] and [[chemical analysis]] such as [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|energy-dispersive spectroscopy]] (EDS), [[chromatography]], [[thermal analysis]], [[electron microscope]] analysis, etc. Structure is studied at various levels, as detailed below.

====Atomic structure====
This deals with the atoms of the materials, and how they are arranged to give molecules, crystals, etc. Much of the electrical, magnetic and chemical properties of materials arise from this level of structure. The length scales involved are in angstroms([[Å]]).
The way in which the atoms and molecules are bonded and arranged is fundamental to studying the properties and behavior of any material.

====Nanostructure====
{{Main|Nanostructure}}
[[File:Buckminsterfullerene-perspective-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Buckminsterfullerene]] nanostructure.]]
Nanostructure deals with objects and structures that are in the 1—100&amp;nbsp;nm range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes |author= Cristina Buzea |author2= Ivan Pacheco |author3= Kevin Robbie |last-author-amp= yes |title= Nanomaterials and Nanoparticles: Sources and Toxicity |journal= Biointerphases |volume= 2 |date= 2007 |pages= MR17–MR71 |doi= 10.1116/1.2815690 |pmid= 20419892 |issue= 4 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120703014917/http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes |archivedate= 2012-07-03 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many materials, atoms or molecules agglomerate together to form objects at the nanoscale. This causes many interesting electrical, magnetic, optical, and mechanical properties.

In describing nanostructures it is necessary to differentiate between the number of dimensions on the [[nanoscale]]. [[Nanotextured surface]]s have ''one dimension'' on the nanoscale, i.e., only the thickness of the surface of an object is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm. Nanotubes have ''two dimensions'' on the nanoscale, i.e., the diameter of the tube is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm; its length could be much greater. Finally, spherical [[nanoparticle]]s have ''three dimensions'' on the nanoscale, i.e., the particle is between 0.1 and 100&amp;nbsp;nm in each spatial dimension. The terms nanoparticles and [[ultrafine particle]]s (UFP) often are used synonymously although UFP can reach into the micrometre range. The term 'nanostructure' is often used when referring to magnetic technology. Nanoscale structure in biology is often called [[ultrastructure]].

Materials which atoms and molecules form constituents in the nanoscale (i.e., they form nanostructure) are called nanomaterials. Nanomaterials are subject of intense research in the materials science community due to the unique properties that they exhibit.

====Microstructure====
{{Main|Microstructure}}
[[File:Pearlite.jpg|thumb|right|Microstructure of pearlite.]]
Microstructure is defined as the structure of a prepared surface or thin foil of material as revealed by a microscope above 25× magnification. It deals with objects from 100&amp;nbsp;nm to a few cm. The microstructure of a material (which can be broadly classified into metallic, polymeric, ceramic and composite) can strongly influence physical properties such as strength, toughness, ductility, hardness, corrosion resistance, high/low temperature behavior, wear resistance, and so on. Most of the traditional materials (such as metals and ceramics) are microstructured.

The manufacture of a perfect [[crystal]] of a material is physically impossible. For example, any crystalline material will contain [[crystallographic defect|defects]] such as [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]], grain boundaries ([[Hall–Petch|Hall–Petch relationship]]), vacancies, interstitial atoms or substitutional atoms. The microstructure of materials reveals these larger defects, so that they can be studied, with significant advances in simulation resulting in exponentially increasing understanding of how defects can be used to enhance material properties.

====Macro structure====
Macro structure is the appearance of a material in the scale millimeters to meters—it is the structure of the material as seen with the naked eye.

===Crystallography===

Crystallography is the science that examines the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids. Crystallography is a useful tool for materials scientists. In single crystals, the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure. Further, physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects. The understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding crystallographic defects. Mostly, materials do not occur as a single crystal, but in polycrystalline form, i.e., as an aggregate of small crystals with different orientations. Because of this, the powder diffraction method, which uses diffraction patterns of polycrystalline samples with a large number of crystals, plays an important role in structural determination.
Most materials have a crystalline structure, but some important materials do not exhibit regular crystal structure. [[Polymer]]s display varying degrees of crystallinity, and many are completely noncrystalline. [[Glass]], some ceramics, and many natural materials are [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]], not possessing any long-range order in their atomic arrangements. The study of polymers combines elements of chemical and statistical thermodynamics to give thermodynamic and mechanical, descriptions of physical properties.

===Bonding===
{{Main|Chemical bonding}}
To obtain a full understanding of the material structure and how it relates to its properties, the materials scientist must study how the different atoms, ions and molecules are arranged and bonded to each other. This involves the study and use of [[quantum chemistry]] or [[quantum physics]]. [[Solid-state physics]], [[solid-state chemistry]] and [[physical chemistry]] are also involved in the study of bonding and structure.

===Properties===
{{Main|List of materials properties}}
Materials exhibit myriad properties, including the following.
:*Mechanical properties, see [[Strength of materials]]
:*Chemical properties, see [[Chemistry]]
:*Electrical properties, see [[Electricity]]
:*Thermal properties, see [[Thermodynamics]]
:*Optical properties, see [[Optics]] and [[Photonics]]
:*Magnetic properties, see [[Magnetism]]
The properties of a material determine its usability and hence its engineering application.

===Synthesis and processing===
Synthesis and processing involves the creation of a material with the desired micro-nanostructure. From an engineering standpoint, a material cannot be used in industry if no economical production method for it has been developed. Thus, the processing of materials is vital to the field of materials science.

Different materials require different processing or synthesis methods. For example, the processing of metals has historically been very important and is studied under the branch of materials science named ''physical [[metallurgy]]''. Also, chemical and physical methods are also used to synthesize other materials such as [[polymer]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[thin film]]s, etc. As of the early 21st century, new methods are being developed to synthesize nanomaterials such as [[graphene]].

===Thermodynamics===
{{Main|Thermodynamics}}
[[File:Eutektikum new.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|A phase diagram for a binary system displaying a eutectic point.]]
Thermodynamics is concerned with [[heat]] and [[temperature]] and their relation to [[energy]] and [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]. It defines [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] variables, such as [[internal energy]], [[entropy]], and [[pressure]], that partly describe a body of matter or radiation. It states that the behavior of those variables is subject to general constraints, that are common to all materials, not the peculiar properties of particular materials. These general constraints are expressed in the four laws of thermodynamics.  Thermodynamics describes the bulk behavior of the body, not the microscopic behaviors of the very large numbers of its microscopic constituents, such as molecules. The behavior of these microscopic particles is described by, and the laws of thermodynamics are derived from, [[statistical mechanics]].

The study of thermodynamics is fundamental to materials science. It forms the foundation to treat general phenomena in materials science and engineering, including chemical reactions, magnetism, polarizability, and elasticity. It also helps in the understanding of phase diagrams and phase equilibrium.

===Kinetics===
{{Main|Chemical kinetics}}
[[Chemical kinetics]] is the study of the rates at which systems that are out of equilibrium change under the influence of various forces. When applied to materials science, it deals with how a material changes with time (moves from non-equilibrium to equilibrium state) due to application of a certain field. It details the rate of various processes evolving in materials including shape, size, composition and structure. [[Diffusion]] is important in the study of kinetics as this is the most common mechanism by which materials undergo change.

Kinetics is essential in processing of materials because, among other things, it details how the microstructure changes with application of heat.

==In research==
Materials science has received much attention from researchers. In most universities, many departments ranging from [[physics]] to [[chemistry]] to [[chemical engineering]], along with materials science departments, are involved in materials research. Research in materials science is vibrant and consists of many avenues. The following list is in no way exhaustive. It serves only to highlight certain important research areas.

===Nanomaterials===
{{Main|Nanomaterials}}
[[File:CNTSEM.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|A [[scanning electron microscopy]] image of carbon nanotubes bundles]]
Nanomaterials describe, in principle, materials of which a single unit is sized (in at least one dimension) between 1 and 1000 nanometers (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; meter) but is usually 1—100&amp;nbsp;nm.

Nanomaterials research takes a materials science-based approach to [[nanotechnology]], leveraging advances in materials [[metrology]] and synthesis which have been developed in support of [[microfabrication]] research.  Materials with structure at the nanoscale often have unique optical, electronic, or mechanical properties.

The field of nanomaterials is loosely organized, like the traditional field of chemistry, into organic (carbon-based) nanomaterials such as fullerenes, and inorganic nanomaterials based on other elements, such as silicon. Examples of nanomaterials include [[fullerene]]s, [[carbon nanotube]]s, [[nanocrystal]]s, etc.

===Biomaterials===
{{Main|Biomaterial}}
[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|The iridescent [[nacre]] inside a [[nautilus]] shell.]]
A biomaterial is any matter, surface, or construct that interacts with biological systems. The study of biomaterials is called ''bio materials science''. It has experienced steady and strong growth over its history, with many companies investing large amounts of money into developing new products. Biomaterials science encompasses elements of [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[tissue engineering]], and materials science.

Biomaterials can be derived either from nature or synthesized in a laboratory using a variety of chemical approaches using metallic components, [[polymer]]s, [[bioceramic]]s, or [[composite material]]s. They are often used and/or adapted for a medical application, and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs, augments, or replaces a natural function. Such functions may be benign, like being used for a [[heart valve]], or may be [[Biological activity|bioactive]] with a more interactive functionality such as [[hydroxylapatite]] coated [[hip implant]]s. Biomaterials are also used every day in dental applications, surgery, and drug delivery. For example, a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body, which permits the prolonged release of a drug over an extended period of time. A biomaterial may also be an [[autograft]], [[allograft]] or [[xenograft]] used as an [[organ transplant]] material.

===Electronic, optical, and magnetic===

Semiconductors, metals, and ceramics are used today to form highly complex systems, such as integrated electronic circuits, optoelectronic devices, and magnetic and optical mass storage media. These materials form the basis of our modern computing world, and hence research into these materials is of vital importance.

[[Semiconductor]]s are a traditional example of these types of materials. They are materials that have properties that are intermediate between [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductors]] and [[insulator (electricity)|insulators]]. Their electrical conductivities are very sensitive to impurity concentrations, and this allows for the use of [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] to achieve desirable electronic properties. Hence, semiconductors form the basis of the traditional computer.

This field also includes new areas of research such as [[superconductivity|superconducting]] materials, [[spintronics]], [[metamaterial]]s, etc. The study of these materials involves knowledge of materials science and [[solid-state physics]] or [[condensed matter physics]].

===Computational science and theory===
With the increase in computing power, simulating the behavior of materials has become possible. This enables materials scientists to discover properties of materials formerly unknown, as well as to design new materials. Up until now, new materials were found by time-consuming trial and error processes. But, now it is hoped that computational methods could drastically reduce that time, and allow tailoring materials properties. This involves simulating materials at all length scales, using methods such as [[density functional theory]], [[molecular dynamics]], etc.

==In industry==
Radical [[Timeline of materials technology|materials advances]] can drive the creation of new products or even new industries, but stable industries also employ materials scientists to make incremental improvements and troubleshoot issues with currently used materials. Industrial applications of materials science include materials design, cost-benefit tradeoffs in industrial production of materials, processing methods ([[casting]], [[rolling]], [[welding]], [[ion implantation]], [[crystal growth]], [[thin-film deposition]], [[sintering]], [[glassblowing]], etc.), and analytic methods (characterization methods such as [[electron microscopy]], [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray diffraction]], [[calorimetry]], [[Microprobe|nuclear microscopy (HEFIB)]], [[Rutherford backscattering]], [[neutron diffraction]], small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), etc.).

Besides material characterization, the material scientist or engineer also deals with extracting materials and converting them into useful forms. Thus ingot casting, foundry methods, blast furnace extraction, and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a materials engineer. Often the presence, absence, or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will greatly affect the final properties of the materials produced. For example, steels are classified based on 1/10 and 1/100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain. Thus, the extracting and purifying methods used to extract iron in a blast furnace can affect the quality of steel that is produced.

===Ceramics and glasses===
{{Main|Ceramic}}
[[File:Si3N4bearings.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ceramic bearing parts]]
Another application of material science is the structures of [[ceramic]]s and [[glass]] typically associated with the most brittle materials. Bonding in ceramics and glasses uses covalent and ionic-covalent types with SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (silica or sand) as a fundamental building block. Ceramics are as soft as clay or as hard as stone and concrete. Usually, they are crystalline in form. Most glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica. At high temperatures used to prepare glass, the material is a viscous liquid. The structure of glass forms into an amorphous state upon cooling. Windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples. Fibers of glass are also available. Scratch resistant Corning [[Gorilla Glass]] is a well-known example of the application of materials science to drastically improve the properties of common components. Diamond and carbon in its graphite form are considered to be ceramics.

Engineering ceramics are known for their stiffness and stability under high temperatures, compression and electrical stress. Alumina, [[silicon carbide]], and [[tungsten carbide]] are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process of sintering with a binder. Hot pressing provides higher density material. Chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material. Cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals. The wear resistance of tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and nickel typically added to modify properties.

===Composites===
{{Main|Composite material}}
[[File:Cfaser haarrp.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A 6 μm diameter carbon filament (running from bottom left to top right) siting atop the much larger human hair.]] [[Fiber|Filaments]] are commonly used for reinforcement in [[composite material]]s.
Another application of materials science in industry is making [[composite material]]s. These are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic phases. Applications range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete, to the thermal insulating tiles which play a key and integral role in NASA's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]] which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. One example is [[reinforced Carbon-Carbon]] (RCC), the light gray material which withstands re-entry temperatures up to {{convert|1510|C|F}} and protects the Space Shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cap. RCC is a laminated composite material made from [[graphite]] [[rayon]] cloth and impregnated with a [[phenolic resin]]. After curing at high temperature in an autoclave, the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon, impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber, and cured-pyrolized to convert the [[furfural]] alcohol to carbon. To provide oxidation resistance for reuse ability, the outer layers of the RCC are converted to [[silicon carbide]].

Other examples can be seen in the "plastic" casings of television sets, cell-phones and so on. These plastic casings are usually a [[composite material]] made up of a thermoplastic matrix such as [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) in which [[calcium carbonate]] chalk, [[talc]], [[glass fiber]]s or [[carbon fiber]]s have been added for added strength, bulk, or electrostatic dispersion. These additions may be termed reinforcing fibers, or dispersants, depending on their purpose.

===Polymers===
{{Main|Polymer}}
[[File:Polypropylene.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The repeating unit of the polymer polypropylene]]
[[File:Expanded polystyrene foam dunnage.jpg|thumb|Expanded polystyrene polymer packaging.]]
[[Polymer]]s are chemical compounds made up of a large number of identical components linked together like chains. They are an important part of materials science. Polymers are the raw materials (the resins) used to make what are commonly called plastics and rubber. Plastics and rubber are really the final product, created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing, which is then shaped into a final form. Plastics which have been around, and which are in current widespread use, include [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[polystyrene]], [[nylon]]s, [[polyester]]s, [[acrylic resin|acrylics]], [[polyurethane]]s, and [[polycarbonate]]s and also rubbers which have been around are natural rubber, [[styrene-butadiene]] rubber, [[chloroprene]], and [[butadiene rubber]]. Plastics are generally classified as ''commodity'', ''specialty'' and [[engineering plastic|''engineering'' plastics]].

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used, inexpensive, and annual production quantities are large. It lends itself to a vast array of applications, from [[artificial leather]] to [[electrical insulation]] and cabling, [[packaging]], and [[Food storage|containers]]. Its fabrication and processing are simple and well-established. The versatility of PVC is due to the wide range of [[plasticiser]]s and other additives that it accepts. The term "additives" in polymer science refers to the chemicals and compounds added to the polymer base to modify its material properties.

[[Polycarbonate]] would be normally considered an engineering plastic (other examples include PEEK, ABS). Such plastics are valued for their superior strengths and other special material properties. They are usually not used for disposable applications, unlike commodity plastics.

Specialty plastics are materials with unique characteristics, such as ultra-high strength, electrical conductivity, electro-fluorescence, high thermal stability, etc.

The dividing lines between the various types of plastics is not based on material but rather on their properties and applications. For example, [[polyethylene]] (PE) is a cheap, low friction polymer commonly used to make disposable bags for shopping and trash, and is considered a commodity plastic, whereas [[medium-density polyethylene]] (MDPE) is used for underground gas and water pipes, and another variety called [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]] (UHMWPE) is an engineering plastic which is used extensively as the glide rails for industrial equipment and the low-friction socket in implanted [[hip joint]]s.

===Metal alloys===
{{Main|Alloy}}
[[File:Steel wire rope.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Wire rope made from [[steel]] alloy.]]
The study of metal alloys is a significant part of materials science. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron ([[steel]], [[stainless steel]], [[cast iron]], [[tool steel]], [[alloy steel]]s) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and [[high carbon steel]]s. An iron-carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the [[hardness]] and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present, with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower ductility and toughness. Heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties, however. Cast Iron is defined as an iron–carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of Chromium. Nickel and Molybdenum are typically also found in stainless steels.

Other significant metallic alloys are those of [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], [[copper]] and [[magnesium]]. [[Copper alloys]] have been known for a long time (since the [[Bronze Age]]), while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed. Due to the chemical reactivity of these metals, the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently. The alloys of aluminium, titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios and, in the case of magnesium, their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding. These materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight ratios are more important than bulk cost, such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications.

===Semiconductors===

The study of semiconductors is a significant part of materials science. A [[semiconductor]] is a material that has a resistivity between a metal and insulator. Its electronic properties can be greatly altered through intentionally introducing impurities or doping. From these semiconductor materials, things such as [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs), and analog and digital [[electric circuit]]s can be built, making them materials of interest in industry. Semiconductor devices have replaced thermionic devices (vacuum tubes) in most applications. Semiconductor devices are manufactured both as single discrete devices and as [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs), which consist of a number—from a few to millions—of devices manufactured and interconnected on a single semiconductor substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aip.org/jobs/profiles/semiconductor-industry-careers |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604150127/https://www.aip.org/jobs/profiles/semiconductor-industry-careers |archivedate=2016-06-04 |df= |date=2013-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the semiconductors in use today, [[silicon]] makes up the largest portion both by quantity and commercial value. Monocrystalline silicon is used to produce wafers used in the semiconductor and electronics industry. Second to silicon, [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) is the second most popular semiconductor used. Due to its higher electron mobility and saturation velocity compared to silicon, it is a material of choice for high-speed electronics applications. These superior properties are compelling reasons to use GaAs circuitry in mobile phones, satellite communications, microwave point-to-point links and higher frequency radar systems. Other semiconductor materials include [[germanium]], [[silicon carbide]], and [[gallium nitride]] and have various applications.

==Relation to other fields==
Materials science evolved—starting from the 1960s—because it was recognized that to create, discover and design new materials, one had to approach it in a unified manner. Thus, materials science and engineering emerged at the intersection of various fields such as [[metallurgy]], [[solid state physics]], [[chemistry]], [[chemical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].

The field is inherently [[interdisciplinary]], and the materials scientists/engineers must be aware and make use of the methods of the physicist, chemist and engineer. The field thus maintains close relationships with these fields. Also, many physicists, chemists and engineers also find themselves working in materials science.

The overlap between physics and materials science has led to the offshoot field of ''materials physics'', which is concerned with the physical properties of materials. The approach is generally more macroscopic and applied than in [[condensed matter physics]]. See [[list of publications in physics#Materials physics|important publications in materials physics]] for more details on this field of study.

The field of materials science and engineering is important both from a scientific perspective, as well as from an engineering one. When discovering new materials, one encounters new phenomena that may not have been observed before. Hence, there is a lot of science to be discovered when working with materials. Materials science also provides a test for theories in condensed matter physics.

Materials are of the utmost importance for engineers, as the usage of the appropriate materials is crucial when designing systems. As a result, materials science is an increasingly important part of an engineer's education.

'''Men of the Trees''' is an international, non-profit, non-political, conservation organisation. It is involved in planting, maintenance and protection of trees. It was founded in [[Kenya]] on July 22, 1922, by [[Richard St. Barbe Baker]]. It was the precursor to another organisation also founded by St. Barbe Baker in 1924 as the '''[[International Tree Foundation]]''', in the [[United Kingdom]].  In 1929, a branch was opened in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CwA-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gEkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6347,2716036&amp;dq=men-of-the-trees+palestine&amp;hl=en The Men of the Trees], The [[Glasgow Herald]] - Jun 18, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being '''overweight''' or '''fat''' is having more [[Adipose tissue|body fat]] than is optimally healthy. Being overweight is especially common where [[dietary energy supply|food supplies]] are plentiful and [[sedentary lifestyle|lifestyles are sedentary]].

{{As of|2003}}, excess weight reached epidemic proportions globally, with more than 1 billion adults being either overweight or [[obesity|obese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/facts/obesity/en/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210035353/http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/facts/obesity/en|archivedate=2011-12-10 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |title=Obesity and overweight |accessdate=2009-04-27 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 this increased to more than 2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673614604608/pdfft?md5=701706b1a1db6f1542a88e52a05a6f89&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S0140673614604608-main.pdf | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60460-8|issn=0140-6736| title = Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980–2013: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013| journal = [[The Lancet]]| date= {{date|May 29, 2014}}| last1 = Ng| first1 = M.| last2 = Fleming | first2 = T.| last3 = Robinson | first3 = M.| last4 = Thomson | first4 = B. | last5 = Graetz | first5 = N. | last6 = Margono | first6 = C.| last7 = Mullany | first7 = E.

A healthy body requires a minimum amount of [[fat]] for proper functioning of the [[hormone|hormonal]], [[reproductive system|reproductive]], and [[immune system|immune]] systems, as [[thermal insulation]], as [[shock absorber|shock absorption]] for sensitive areas, and as [[Lipid|energy]] for future use. But the accumulation of too much storage fat can impair movement, flexibility, and alter the [[body shape|appearance of the body]].

== Classification ==
{{See also|Body fat percentage}}

The degree to which a person is overweight is generally described by the [[body mass index]] (BMI). ''Overweight'' is defined as a BMI of 25 or more, thus it includes pre-obesity defined as a BMI between 25 and 30 and [[obesity]] as defined by a BMI of 30 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obesity: preventing and managing the global epidemic. Report of a WHO convention |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |place=Geneva |year=1999 |pmid=11234459 |volume=894 |pages=i–xii, 1–253 |journal=World Health Organization technical report series}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults: The Evidence Report |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/ob_gdlns.pdf |format=PDF |date=September 1998 |accessdate=2009-04-27 |publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-obese and overweight however are often used interchangeably, thus giving overweight a common definition of a BMI of between 25–30.&lt;!--

*Body mass index
:The body mass index (BMI) is a measure of a person's weight taking into account their height.  It is given by the following formula: BMI equals a person's weight (mass) in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in metres. The units therefore are kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; but BMI measures are typically used and written without units.

:BMI provides a significantly more accurate representation of body fat content than simply measuring a person's weight. It is only moderately correlated with both body fat percentage and body fat mass ([[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] of 0.68).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Use of relative weight and Body Mass Index for the determination of adiposity |last1=Gray |first1=D. S. |last2=Fujioka |first2=K. J. |journal=[[Journal of Clinical Epidemiology]] |year=1991 |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=545–50 |pmid=2037859 |doi=10.1016/0895-4356(91)90218-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not take into account certain factors such as pregnancy or bodybuilding; however, the BMI is an accurate reflection of fat percentage in the majority of the adult population.
*[[Body volume index]]
:The body volume index (BVI) was devised in 2000 as a computer, rather than manual, measurement of the human body for obesity and an alternative to the BMI

:BVI uses 3D software to create an accurate image of a person so BVI can differentiate between people with the same BMI rating, but who have a different shape and different weight distribution.
[[File:Overweight biker.jpg|thumb|right|220px|An obese man on a motorcycle]]
[[File:Overweight teenage boy (side).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Belly of an overweight teenager]]
[[File:Variation in body fat 12577.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Children with varying levels of body fat]]
:BVI measures where a person's weight and the fat are located on the body, rather than total weight or total fat content and places emphasis on the weight carried around the abdomen, commonly known as [[central obesity]]. There has been an acceptance in recent years that abdominal fat and weight around the abdomen constitute a greater health risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craver |first=R. |date=10 September 2008 |url=http://www.wakehealth.edu/Gerontology-and-Geriatrics/Location,-not-volume,-of-fat-found-to-be-key.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515223636/http://www.wakehealth.edu/Gerontology-and-Geriatrics/Location,-not-volume,-of-fat-found-to-be-key.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 May 2013 |title=Location, not volume, of fat found to be key |publisher=Journalnow.com |accessdate=2008-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[weighing scale|Simple weighing]]
:A person's weight is measured and compared to an estimated ideal weight. This is the easiest and most common method, but by far the least accurate, as it only measures one quantity (weight) and often does not take into account many factors such as height, [[body type]], and relative amount of [[muscle]] mass.
*Skinfold [[caliper]]s or "pinch test"
:The skin at several specific points on the body is pinched and the thickness of the resulting fold is measured.  This measures the thickness of the layers of fat located under the skin, from which a general measurement of total amount of fat in the body is calculated.  This method can be reasonably accurate for many people, but it assumes particular fat distribution patterns over the body—which may not apply to all individuals, and does not account for fat deposits not directly under the skin.  Also, as the measurement and analysis generally involves a high degree of practice and interpretation, an accurate result requires that a professional perform it. It cannot generally be done by patients themselves.
*[[Bioelectrical impedance analysis]]
:A small electric current is passed through the body to measure its [[electrical resistance]]. As fat and muscle conduct electricity differently, this method can provide a direct measurement of the body fat percentage, in relation to muscle mass. In the past, this technique could only be performed reliably by trained professionals with specialized equipment, but it is now possible to buy home testing kits that let people do this themselves with a minimum of training.  Despite the improved simplicity of this process over the years, however, a number of factors can affect the results, including [[Fluid replacement|hydration]] and [[body temperature]], so it still needs some care when taking the test to ensure that the results are accurate.
*[[hydrostatic equilibrium|Hydrostatic]] weighing
:Considered one of the more accurate methods of measuring body fat, this technique involves complete submersion of a person in water, with special equipment to measure the person's weight while submerged. This weight is then compared with "dry weight" as recorded outside the water to determine overall body density. As fat is less dense than muscle, careful application of this technique can provide a reasonably close estimate of fat content in the body.  This technique does, however, require expensive specialized equipment and trained professionals to administer it properly.
*[[Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DEXA)
:Originally developed to measure bone density, DEXA imaging is also used to precisely determine body fat content by using the density of various body tissues to identify which portions of the body are fat. This test is generally considered very accurate, but requires a great deal of expensive medical equipment and trained professionals to perform.

The most common method for discussing this subject and the one used primarily by researchers and advisory institutions is BMI. Definitions of what is considered overweight vary by ethnicity. The current definition proposed by the US [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) designates whites, Hispanics and blacks with a BMI of 25 or more as overweight. For Asians, overweight is a BMI between 23 and 29.9 and obesity for all groups is a BMI of 30 or more.

BMI, however, does not account extremes of muscle mass, some rare [[genetics|genetic]] factors, the very young, and a few other individual variations.

If an individual is overweight and has excess body fat it can create or lead to health risks.

== Health effects ==
While the negative health outcomes associated with obesity are accepted within the medical community, the health implications of the overweight category are more controversial. The generally accepted view is that being overweight causes similar health problems to obesity, but to a lesser degree. A 2016 review estimated that the risk of death increases by seven percent among overweight people with a BMI of 25 to 27.5 and 20 percent among overweight people with a BMI of 27.5 to 30.&lt;ref name=Lancet2016Mort&gt;{{cite journal|title=Body-mass index and all-cause mortality: individual-participant-data meta-analysis of 239 prospective studies in four continents|journal=Lancet|date=13 July 2016|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30175-1|pmid=27423262|pmc=4995441|volume=388|pages=776–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Framingham heart study found that being overweight at age 40 reduced life expectancy by three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peeters |first1=A. |last2=Barendregt |first2=J.

[[Katherine Flegal]] et al., however, found that the [[mortality rate]] for individuals who are classified as overweight (BMI 25 to 30) may actually be lower than for those with an "ideal" weight (BMI 18.5 to 25), noting that many studies show that the lowest mortality rate is at a BMI close to 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=K.

== Causes ==
Being overweight is generally caused by the intake of more [[calorie]]s (by eating) than are expended by the body (by exercise and everyday activity). Factors that may contribute to this imbalance include:

* [[Alcoholism]]
* [[Eating disorder]]s (such as [[binge eating disorder|binge eating]])
* [[Genetic predisposition]]
* [[Hormone|Hormonal]] imbalances (e.g. [[hypothyroidism]])
* Insufficient or poor-quality sleep
* Limited [[physical exercise]] and a [[sedentary lifestyle]]
* [[Malnutrition|Poor nutrition]]
* [[Metabolic disorder]]s, which could be caused by repeated attempts to lose weight by [[Yo-yo dieting|weight cycling]]
* [[Overeating]]
* [[Psychoactive drug|Psychotropic medication]] (e.g. [[olanzapine]])
* [[Smoking cessation]] and other [[stimulant]] withdrawal
* [[Stress (biology)|Stress]]

People who have [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|insulin dependent diabetes]] and chronically overdose insulin may gain weight, while people who already are overweight may develop insulin tolerance, and in the long run develop [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type II diabetes]].

== Treatment ==
{{See also|Management of obesity}}
The usual treatments for overweight individuals is [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and physical exercise.

Dietitians generally recommend eating several balanced meals dispersed through the day, with a combination of progressive, primarily aerobic, physical exercise.

Because these general treatments help most case of obesity, they are common in all levels of overweight individuals.

== Epidemiology ==
As much as 64% of the United States' adult population is considered either overweight or obese, and this percentage has increased over the last four decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=K. M. |last1=Flegal |first2=M. D. |last2=Carroll |first3=C. L. |last3=Ogden |last4=Johnson |first4=C.

'''Perifosine''' (also '''KRX-0401''') is a drug candidate being developed for a variety of cancer indications.
It is an alkyl-[[phospholipid]]&lt;ref name=Kond2003&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/2/11/1093.full |title=Perifosine, a novel alkylphospholipid, inhibits protein kinase B activation |date=Nov 2003 |publisher=Mol Cancer Ther |author=Kondapaka|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; structurally related to [[miltefosine]].

The '''Plasma Acoustic Shield System''', or PASS, is in the process of being developed by [[Stellar Photonics]]. The company received a $2.7 million contract from the U.S. Government to build the PASS.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11723-plasma-shield-may-stun-and-disorientate-enemies.html |title=Plasma Shield may stun and disorientate enemies |work=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=2008-09-22 |date=26 April 2007 |first=David |last=Hambling}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a project supervised by the [[United States Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center]]. The laser was first tested in 2008, and will continue to be tested into 2009, with the testing of turret-mounted PASS.

==Function==
The device is able to disorient an enemy using a series of mid-air explosions, and may also use "high-power speakers for hailing or warning, and a dazzler light source" &lt;ref name="new"/&gt; Its low power would mean that it would be unable to do significant damage to a specific enemy. While it would not be classified as a weapon, because of its inability to stun or disable a target, its distracting light or explosions are hoped to impede the progress of those in its path. "The [PASS] creates a “mid-air plasma ball” that “basically ignites the air in front of the person...It creates fireworks right in front of you.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dandelionsalad.wordpress.com/2008/07/11/non-lethal-weapons-where-science-and-technology-service-repression/ |title="Non-Lethal" Weapons: Where Science and Technology Service Repression |first=Tom |last=Burghardt
|date=10 July 2008 |website=Dandelion Salad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The PASS uses Synchronized Photo-pulse Detonation (SPD), a technology researched by Stellar Photonics wherein two short but powerful laser pulses first create a ball of plasma, then a supersonic shockwave creates a flash and a loud bang. Pass is the first functioning SPD weapon system, and it may lead to the construction of a "man-portable tuneable laser weapon that could be used in both non-lethal and lethal modes".&lt;ref name="new"/&gt;

Comment:
The graphs contain ''rarefaction'' shock wave (density behind the wave is less than that ahead of the jump); for normal gas (for example, for perfect gas) this contradicts the second law of thermodynamics ([[Győző Zemplén|Zemplén]] theorem).

In a coordinate system that is moving with the discontinuity, the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions can be expressed as:&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (2018). Combustion theory. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
      &amp; \rho_1\,u_1  = \rho_2\,u_2\equiv m &amp;\qquad \text{Conservation of mass}\\
      &amp; \rho_1\,u_1^2 + p_1  = \rho_2\,u_2^2 + p_2  &amp;\qquad \text{Conservation of momentum}\\
      &amp; h_1 + u_1^2/2  = h_2 + u_2^2/2 &amp;\qquad \text{Conservation of energy}
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the mass flow rate per unit area, ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[mass density]] of the fluid upstream and downstream of the wave, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the fluid velocity upstream and downstream of the wave, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the pressures in the two regions, and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the ''specific'' (with the sense of ''per unit mass'') [[enthalpy|enthalpies]] in the two regions. If in addition, the flow is reactive, then the species conservation equations demands that

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{i,1}=\omega_{i,2}=0,\quad i = 1,2,3,...N, \qquad \text{Conservation of species}&lt;/math&gt;

to vanish both upstream and downstream of the discontinuity. Here, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the mass production rate of the ''i''th species of total ''N'' species involved in the reaction. Combining conservation of mass and momentum gives us

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_2-p_1}{1/\rho_2-1/\rho_1}=-m^2&lt;/math&gt;

which defines a straight line known as the '''Rayleigh line''' with a negative slope (since &lt;math&gt;m^2&lt;/math&gt; is always positive) in the &lt;math&gt;p-\rho^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; plane. Using the Rankine-Hugoniot equations for the conservation of mass and momentum to eliminate ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the equation for the conservation of energy can be expressed as the '''Hugoniot equation''':
:&lt;math&gt;
  h_2 - h_1 = \frac{1}{2}\,\left(\frac{1}{\rho_2}+\frac{1}{\rho_1}\right)\,(p_2 - p_1).
 &lt;/math&gt;
The inverse of the density can also be expressed as the [[specific volume]], &lt;math&gt;v=1/\rho&lt;/math&gt;. Along with these, one has to specify the relation between the upstream and downstream equation of state
:&lt;math&gt;
f(p_1,\rho_1,T_1,Y_{i,1})=f(p_2,\rho_2,T_2,Y_{i,2})
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]] of the species. Finally, the calorific equation of state &lt;math&gt;h=h(p,\rho,Y_i)&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be known, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
h(p_1,\rho_1,Y_{i,1})=h(p_2,\rho_2,Y_{i,2}).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Simplified Rankine-Hugoniot relations&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (2018). Combustion theory. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;==

The following assumptions are made in order to simplify the Rankine-Hugoniot equations. The mixture is assumed to obey the [[ideal gas law]], so that relation between the downstream and upstream equation of state can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_2}{\rho_2T_2}=\frac{p_1}{\rho_1T_1}=\frac{R}{\overline W}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]] and the mean [[molecular weight]] &lt;math&gt;\overline W&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be constant (otherwise, &lt;math&gt;\overline W&lt;/math&gt; would depend on the mass fraction of the all species). If one assumes that the [[specific heat]] at constant pressure &lt;math&gt;c_p &lt;/math&gt; is also constant across the wave, the change in enthalpies (calorific equation of state) can be simply written as

:&lt;math&gt;h_2-h_1 = -q + c_p(T_2-T_1)&lt;/math&gt;

where the first term in the above expression represents the amount of heat released per unit mass of the upstream mixture by the wave and the second term represents the sensible heating. Eliminating temperature using the equation of state and substituting the above expression for the change in enthalpies into the Hugoniot equation, one obtains a '''Hugoniot equation''' expressed only in terms of pressure and densities,

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}\right)\left(\frac{p_2}{\rho_2}-\frac{p_1}{\rho_1}\right) - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{\rho_2}+\frac{1}{\rho_2}\right)(p_2-p_1) = q,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat ratio]]. Hugoniot curve without heat release (&lt;math&gt;q=0&lt;/math&gt;) is often called as '''Shock Hugoniot'''. Along with the '''Rayleigh line''' equation, the above equation completely determines the state of the system. These two equations can be written compactly by introducing the following non-dimensional scales,

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde p = \frac{p_2}{p_1},\quad \tilde v = \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2}, \quad \alpha = \frac{q\rho_1}{p_1}, \quad \mu = \frac{m^2}{p_1\rho_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Rayleigh line equation and the Hugoniot equation then simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\frac{\tilde p-1}{\tilde v-1} = -\mu \\
\tilde p = &amp;\frac{[2\alpha + (\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)]-\tilde v}{[(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)]\tilde v-1}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Given the upstream conditions, the intersection of above two equations in the &lt;math&gt;\tilde p-\tilde v&lt;/math&gt; plane determine the downstream conditions. If there is no heat release occurs, for example, shock waves without chemical reaction, then &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0&lt;/math&gt;. The Hugoniot curves asymptote to the lines &lt;math&gt;\tilde v = (\gamma-1)/(\gamma+1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde p=-(\gamma-1)/(\gamma+1)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the pressure jump across the wave can take any values between &lt;math&gt;0\leq \tilde p&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, but the specific volume ratio is restricted to the interval &lt;math&gt;(\gamma-1)/(\gamma+1)\leq \tilde v \leq 2\alpha + (\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)&lt;/math&gt; (the upper bound is derived for the case &lt;math&gt;\tilde p\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; because pressure cannot take negative values). The [[Chapman–Jouguet condition]] is where Rayleigh line is tangent to the Hugoniot curve.

If &lt;math&gt;\gamma=1.4&lt;/math&gt; (diatomic gas without the vibrational mode excitation), the interval is &lt;math&gt;1/6\leq \tilde v\leq 2\alpha + 6&lt;/math&gt;, in other words, the shock wave can increase the density at most by a factor of 6. For monoatomic gas, &lt;math&gt;\gamma=5/3&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the density ratio is limited by the interval &lt;math&gt;1/4\leq \tilde v\leq 2\alpha + 4&lt;/math&gt;. For diatomic gases with vibrational mode excited, we have &lt;math&gt;\gamma=9/7&lt;/math&gt; leading to the interval &lt;math&gt;1/8\leq \tilde v\leq 2\alpha + 8&lt;/math&gt;. In reality, the specific heat ratio is not constant in the shock wave due to molecular dissociation and ionization, but even in these cases, density ratio in general do not exceed the factor &lt;math&gt;11-13&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Zel’Dovich, Y. B., &amp; Raizer, Y. P. (2012). Physics of shock waves and high-temperature hydrodynamic phenomena. Courier Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation from Euler equations==
Consider gas in a one-dimensional container (e.g., a long thin tube).
Assume that the fluid is [[Inviscid flow|inviscid]]
(i.e., it shows no viscosity effects as for example
friction with the tube walls).
Furthermore, assume that there is no heat transfer by conduction or radiation and that gravitational acceleration can be neglected.
Such a system can be described by the following
system of [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s,
known as the 1D [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]], that in conservation form is:

::&lt;math&gt;(\;1)\quad \quad\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} \;\; =  -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\rho u\right)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;(\;2)\quad \quad\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho u) \, =  -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\rho u^{2}+p\right)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;(\;3)\quad \quad\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(E^t)  =  -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[u\left(E^t+p\right)\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \,&lt;/math&gt; fluid [[mass density]], 

:&lt;math&gt;u = \,&lt;/math&gt; fluid [[velocity]], 

:&lt;math&gt;e = \,&lt;/math&gt; specific [[internal energy]] of the fluid, 

:&lt;math&gt;p = \,&lt;/math&gt; fluid [[pressure]], and

:&lt;math&gt;E^t = \rho e+\rho \frac{1}{2}u^{2},&lt;/math&gt; is the total energy density of the fluid, [J/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;], while ''e'' is its specific internal energy 

Assume further that the gas is calorically ideal and that therefore a polytropic [[equation of state|equation-of-state]] of the simple form

::&lt;math&gt;(\;4)\quad\quad p=\left(\gamma-1\right)\rho e,&lt;/math&gt;

is valid, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the constant ratio of specific heats &lt;math&gt;c_p/c_v&lt;/math&gt;.
This quantity also appears as the ''polytropic exponent''
of the polytropic process described by

::&lt;math&gt;(\;5)\quad \quad \frac{p}{\rho^\gamma}  =  \text{constant}.&lt;/math&gt;

For an extensive list of compressible flow equations, etc., refer to [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] Report 1135 (1953).&lt;ref name="[Ame-53]"&gt;{{citation |author=Ames Research Staff |year=1953 |title=Equations, Tables  and Charts for Compressible Flow |journal=Report 1135 of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930091059_1993091059.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: For a calorically ideal gas &lt;math&gt;\gamma \,&lt;/math&gt; is a constant and for a thermally ideal gas &lt;math&gt;\gamma \,&lt;/math&gt; is a function of temperature. In the latter case, the dependence of pressure
on mass density and internal energy might differ from that given by
equation (4).

===The jump condition===
Before proceeding further it is necessary to introduce the concept of a ''jump condition'' – a condition that holds at a discontinuity or abrupt change.

Consider a 1D situation where there is a jump in the scalar conserved physical quantity &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, which is governed by integral conservation law
::&lt;math&gt; (\;6) \quad\quad\frac{d}{dt} 
\int_{x_1}^{x_2}w \, dx =  -\left.f\left(w\right)\right|_{x_1}^{x_2}&lt;/math&gt;
for any &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;, and, therefore, by partial differential equation 
::&lt;math&gt; (\;6') \quad\quad \frac{\partial w}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f\left(w\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;
for smooth solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the integral conservation law &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle(6)&lt;/math&gt; could not, in general, be obtained from differential equation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle(6')&lt;/math&gt; by integraition over &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle[x_1;x_2]&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle(6')&lt;/math&gt; holds for smooth solutions only.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let the solution exhibit a jump (or shock) at &lt;math&gt;x=x_{s}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x_{1}&lt;x_{s}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{s}(t)&lt;x_{2}&lt;/math&gt;, then

::&lt;math&gt;(\;7) \quad\quad \frac{d}{dt}\left[ \left(
\int_{x_1}^{x_s(t)}w \, dx + \int_{x_s(t)}^{x_2} w\,dx \right) \right]  =  -\int_{x_1}^{x_2}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f\left(w\right)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;(\;8) \quad\quad \therefore w_1\frac{dx_s}{dt}-w_2 \frac{dx_s}{dt} + \int_{x_1}^{x_s(t)} w_t \, dx + \int_{x_s(t)}^{x_2}w_t \, dx  =  -\left.f\left(w\right)\right|_{x_1}^{x_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The subscripts ''1'' and ''2'' indicate conditions ''just  upstream'' and ''just downstream'' of the jump respectively, i.e. &lt;math&gt;w_1 = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0^{+}} w(x_s - \epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_2 = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0^{+}} w(x_s + \epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note, to arrive at equation (8) we have used the fact that &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle dx_1/dt=0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle dx_2/dt=0}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, let &lt;math&gt;x_1\rightarrow x_s(t) - \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2\rightarrow x_s(t) + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, when we have &lt;math&gt;\int_{x_1}^{x_s(t)-\epsilon}w_t \, dx\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_{x_s(t)+\epsilon}^{x_2}w_t \, dx\rightarrow0&lt;/math&gt;, and in the limit

::&lt;math&gt; (\;9) \quad\quad u_s\left(w_1 - w_2\right) = f \left( w_1 \right) - f \left( w_2 \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where we have defined &lt;math&gt;u_s=dx_s(t)/dt \,&lt;/math&gt; (the system ''characteristic'' or ''shock speed''), which by simple division is given by

::&lt;math&gt; (10) \quad\quad u_s =  \frac{f\left(w_1\right) -  f\left(w_2 \right)}{w_1 - w_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equation (9) represents the jump condition for conservation law (6).  A shock situation arises in a system where its ''characteristics'' intersect, and under these conditions a requirement for a unique single-valued solution is that the solution should satisfy the ''admissibility  condition'' or ''entropy condition''. For physically real applications this means that the solution should satisfy the ''Lax entropy  condition''

::&lt;math&gt; (11) \quad\quad f^{\prime} \left(w_1\right) &gt; u_s &gt; f^{\prime} \left( w_2 \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime}\left(w_1\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime}\left(w_2\right)&lt;/math&gt; represent ''characteristic speeds'' at upstream and downstream conditions respectively.

===Shock condition===
In the case of the hyperbolic conservation law (6), we have seen that the shock speed can be obtained by simple division. However, for the 1D Euler equations ( 1), ( 2) and ( 3), we have the vector state variable &lt;math&gt;\left[\rho,\rho u,E\right]^T&lt;/math&gt; and the jump conditions become

::&lt;math&gt;(12)\quad\quad\quad\quad\; u_s\left(\rho_2 - \rho_1 \right) = \rho_2 u_2 - \rho_1 u_1 &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;(13)\quad\quad\; u_s\left(\rho_2 u_2 - \rho_1 u_1 \right) = \left( \rho_2 u_2^2 +p_ 2 \right) - \left(\rho_1 u_1^2 +p_1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;(14)\quad\quad u_s\left(E_2 - E_1 \right) = \left[ \rho_ 2 u_ 2 \left( e_ 2 + \frac{1}{2} u_2^2 +p_2/\rho_2 \right)\right] - \left[\rho_1 u_1 \left( e_1 + \frac{1}{2} u_1^2 + p_1/\rho_1 \right)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Rankine Hugoniot Shock.png|thumb|200px|A schematic diagram of a shock wave situation with the density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, velocity &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, and temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; indicated for each region.]]

Equations (12), (13) and (14) are known as the ''Rankine–Hugoniot conditions'' for the Euler equations and are derived by enforcing the conservation laws in integral form over a control volume that includes the shock. For this situation &lt;math&gt;u_s&lt;/math&gt; cannot be obtained by simple division. However, it can be shown by transforming the problem to a moving co-ordinate system
(setting &lt;math&gt;u_s':=u_s-u_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u'_1:=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u'_2:=u_2-u_1&lt;/math&gt;
to remove &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt;)
and some algebraic manipulation
(involving the elimination of &lt;math&gt;u'_2&lt;/math&gt;
from the transformed equation (13) using the transformed equation (12)),
that the shock speed is given by

::&lt;math&gt;(15)\quad\quad u_s = u_1 + c_1 \sqrt{1 + \frac{\gamma+1}{2\gamma} \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} - 1\right)},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c_{1}=\sqrt{\gamma p_{1}/\rho_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of sound in the fluid at upstream conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Liepmann, H. W., &amp; Roshko, A. (1957).

[[File:HEL plain.svg|250px|thumb|Hugoniot elastic limit in the ''p''-''v'' plane for a shock in an elastic-plastic material.]]
For shocks in solids, a closed form expression such as equation (15) cannot be derived from first principles. Instead, experimental observations &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ahrens|first=T.J.|year=1993|title=Equation of state|journal=High Pressure Shock Compression of Solids, eds. J. R. Asay and M. Shahinpoor|location=Springer-Verlag, New York|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~planets/sstewart/ahrens/Papers_pdf/Seismo_1656.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that a linear relation&lt;ref name=Kerley&gt; Though a linear relation is widely assumed to hold, experimental data suggest that almost 80% of tested materials do not satisfy this widely accepted linear behavior.  See Kerley, G. I, 2006, "The Linear US-uP Relation in Shock-Wave Physics", https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.6916.pdf; for details.&lt;/ref&gt; can be used instead (called the '''shock Hugoniot''' in the ''u''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-''u''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; plane) that has the form
:&lt;math&gt;
  u_s = c_0 + s\,u_p = c_0 + s \,u_2
 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the bulk speed of sound in the material (in uniaxial compression), ''s'' is a parameter (the slope of the shock Hugoniot) obtained from fits to experimental data, and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;=''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the particle velocity inside the compressed region behind the shock front.  

The above relation, when combined with the Hugoniot equations for the conservation of mass and momentum, can be used to determine the shock Hugoniot in the ''p''-''v'' plane, where ''v'' is the specific volume (per unit mass):&lt;ref&gt;Poirier, J-P. (2008) "Introduction to the Physics of the Earth's Interior", Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  p_2 - p_1 = \frac{c_0^2\, \rho_1\, \rho_2\, (\rho_2-\rho_1)}{[\rho_2 - s(\rho_2 - \rho_1)]^2}
            = \frac{c_0^2\,(v_1 - v_2)}{[v_1 - s(v_1-v_2)]^2} \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Alternative equations of state, such as the [[Mie–Gruneisen equation of state]] may also be used instead of the above equation.

The shock Hugoniot describes the locus of all possible [[thermodynamic state]]s a material can exist in behind a shock, projected onto a two dimensional state-state plane.  It is therefore a set of equilibrium states and does not specifically represent the path through which a material undergoes transformation.

Weak shocks are [[isentropic]] and that the isentrope represents the path through which the material is loaded from the initial to final states by a compression wave with converging characteristics.  In the case of weak shocks, the Hugoniot will therefore fall directly on the isentrope and can be used directly as the equivalent path.  In the case of a strong shock we can no longer make that simplification directly. However, for engineering calculations, it is deemed that the isentrope is close enough to the Hugoniot that the same assumption can be made.

If the Hugoniot is approximately the loading path between states for an "equivalent" compression wave, then the jump conditions for the shock loading path can be determined by drawing a straight line between the initial and final states.  This line is called the '''Rayleigh line''' and has the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt; 
  p_2 - p_1 = u_s^2\left(\rho_1 - \frac{\rho_1^2}{\rho_2}\right)\,
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Hugoniot elastic limit ===
Most solid materials undergo [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] deformations when subjected to strong shocks.  The point on the shock Hugoniot at which a material transitions from a purely [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] state to an elastic-plastic state is called the '''Hugoniot elastic limit''' (HEL) and the pressure at which this transition takes place is denoted ''p''&lt;sub&gt;HEL&lt;/sub&gt;.  Values of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;HEL&lt;/sub&gt; can range from 0.2 GPa to 20 GPa.  Above the HEL, the material loses much of its shear strength and starts behaving like a fluid.

A '''reciprocating engine''', also often known as a '''piston engine''', is typically a [[heat engine]] (although there are also [[pneumatic motor|pneumatic]] and [[hydraulic motor|hydraulic]] reciprocating engines) that uses one or more [[Reciprocating motion|reciprocating]] [[piston]]s to convert [[pressure]] into a [[Circular motion|rotating motion]]. This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the [[internal combustion engine]], used extensively in motor vehicles; the [[steam engine]], the mainstay of the [[Industrial Revolution]]; and the niche application [[Stirling engine]]. Internal combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a [[spark-ignition engine|spark-ignition (SI) engine]], where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a [[compression-ignition engine|compression-ignition (CI) engine]], where the air within the cylinder is compressed, [[Adiabatic process|thus heating it]], so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected [[diesel engine|then]] or [[hot bulb engine|earlier]].&lt;ref name="Cengal" &gt;''Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach'' by Yunus A. Cengal and Michael A. Boles&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common features in all types==
There may be one or more pistons. Each piston is inside a [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], into which a gas is introduced, either already under pressure (e.g. [[steam engine]]), or heated inside the cylinder either by [[ignition system|ignition]] of a fuel air mixture ([[internal combustion engine]]) or by contact with a hot heat exchanger in the cylinder ([[Stirling engine]]). The hot gases expand, pushing the piston to the bottom of the cylinder. This position is also known as the Bottom Dead Center (BDC), or where the piston forms the largest volume in the cylinder. The piston is returned to the cylinder top ([[Top dead centre|Top Dead Centre]]) (TDC) by a [[flywheel]], the power from other pistons connected to the same shaft or (in a [[Single- and Double-acting cylinder#Double-acting|double acting cylinder]]) by the same process acting on the other side of the piston. This is where the piston forms the smallest volume in the cylinder. In most types the expanded or "[[Exhaust gas|exhausted]]" gases are removed from the cylinder by this [[Stroke (engines)|stroke]]. The exception is the [[Stirling engine]], which repeatedly heats and cools the same sealed quantity of gas. The stroke is simply the distance between the TDC and the BDC, or the greatest distance that the piston can travel in one direction.

In some designs the piston may be powered in both directions in the cylinder, in which case it is said to be [[Single- and Double-acting cylinder#Double-acting|double-acting]].

In most types, the linear movement of the piston is converted to a rotating movement via a [[connecting rod]] and a [[crankshaft]] or by a [[swashplate]] or other suitable mechanism. A [[flywheel]] is often used to ensure smooth rotation or to store energy to carry the engine through an un-powered part of the cycle. The more cylinders a reciprocating engine has, generally, the more vibration-free (smoothly) it can operate. The power of a reciprocating engine is proportional to the volume of the combined pistons' displacement.

A seal must be made between the sliding [[piston]] and the walls of the [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] so that the high pressure gas above the piston does not leak past it and reduce the efficiency of the engine. This seal is usually provided by one or more [[piston ring]]s. These are rings made of a hard metal, and are sprung into a circular groove in the piston head. The rings fit closely in the groove and press lightly against the cylinder wall to form a seal, and more heavily when higher combustion pressure moves around to their inner surfaces.

It is common to classify such engines by the number and alignment of cylinders and total volume of [[Engine displacement|displacement]] of gas by the pistons moving in the cylinders usually measured in cubic centimetres (cm³ or cc) or [[litre]]s (l) or (L) (US: liter). For example, for internal combustion engines, single and two-cylinder designs are common in smaller vehicles such as [[motorcycles]], while [[automobile]]s typically have between four and eight, and [[locomotive]]s, and [[ships]] may have a dozen cylinders or more. Cylinder capacities may range from 10&amp;nbsp;cm³ or less in model engines up to thousands of liters in ships' engines.&lt;ref&gt;Hanlon, Mike. [http://www.gizmag.com/go/3263/ Most powerful diesel engine in the world] ''GizMag''. Accessed: 14 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[compression ratio]] affects the performance in most types of reciprocating engine. It is the ratio between the volume of the cylinder, when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke, and the volume when the piston is at the top of its stroke.

The [[Stroke ratio|bore/stroke ratio]] is the ratio of the diameter of the piston, or "bore", to the length of travel within the cylinder, or  "stroke". If this is around 1 the engine is said to be "square", if it is greater than 1, i.e. the bore is larger than the stroke, it is "oversquare". If it is less than 1, i.e. the stroke is larger than the bore, it is "undersquare".

Cylinders may be aligned [[Straight engine|in line]], in a [[V engine|V configuration]], [[Flat engine|horizontally opposite]] each other, or [[Radial engine|radially]] around the crankshaft. [[Opposed-piston engine]]s put two pistons working at opposite ends of the same cylinder and this has been extended into triangular arrangements such as the [[Napier Deltic]]. Some designs have set the cylinders in motion around the shaft, such as the [[Rotary engine]].

[[Image:BetaStirlingTG4web.svg|thumb|250px|'''Stirling piston engine''' [[Rhombic drive|Rhombic Drive]] – Beta Stirling Engine Design, showing the second displacer piston (green) within the cylinder, which shunts the working gas between the hot and cold ends, but produces no power itself.

In steam engines and internal combustion engines, valves are required to allow the entry and exit of gases at the correct times in the piston's cycle. These are worked by cams, eccentrics or cranks driven by the shaft of the engine. Early designs used the [[D slide valve]] but this has been largely superseded by [[Piston valve]] or [[Poppet valve]] designs. In steam engines the point in the piston cycle at which the steam inlet valve closes is called the [[Cutoff (steam engine)|cutoff]] and this can often be controlled to adjust the [[torque]] supplied by the engine and improve efficiency. In some steam engines, the action of the valves can be replaced by an [[oscillating cylinder]].

Internal combustion engines operate through a sequence of strokes that admit and remove gases to and from the cylinder. These operations are repeated cyclically  and an engine is said to be [[Two-stroke cycle|2-stroke]], [[Four-stroke cycle|4-stroke]] or [[Six stroke engine|6-stroke]] depending on the number of strokes it takes to complete a cycle.

In some steam engines, the cylinders may be of varying size with the smallest bore cylinder working the highest pressure steam. This is then fed through one or more, increasingly larger bore cylinders successively, to extract power from the steam at increasingly lower pressures. These engines are called [[Compound engine]]s.

Aside from looking at the power that the engine can produce, the Mean Effective Pressure (MEP), can also be used in comparing the power output and performance of reciprocating engines of the same size. The mean effective pressure is the fictitious pressure which would produce the same amount of net work that was produced during the power stroke cycle. This is shown by:
: W&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; = MEP × Piston Area × Stroke = MEP × Displacement Volume

and therefore:
: MEP = W&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; / Displacement Volume

Whichever engine with the larger value of MEP produces more net work per cycle and performs more efficiently.&lt;ref name="Cengal" /&gt;

==History==
{{further information|History of the steam engine|History of the internal combustion engine}}

An early known example of rotary to reciprocating motion is the [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] mechanism. The earliest hand-operated cranks appeared in [[China]] during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC–220 AD).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 118"&gt;Needham, Joseph. (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. Pages 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[saw mill]]s in [[Roman Asia]] and [[Byzantine Syria]] during the 3rd–6th centuries AD had a crank and [[connecting rod]] mechanism which converted the rotary motion of a [[water wheel]] into the linear movement of saw blades.&lt;ref name="Tullia et al. (2007) 161"&gt;{{citation|last=Ritti|first=Tullia|last2=Grewe|first2= Klaus|last3=Kessener|first3=Paul|title=A Relief of a Water-powered Stone Saw Mill on a Sarcophagus at Hierapolis and its Implications|journal=Journal of Roman Archaeology|pages=138–163|volume=20| year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1206, Arab engineer [[Al-Jazari]] invented a [[crankshaft]].&lt;ref name=Ganchy&gt;{{citation|title=Islam and Science, Medicine, and Technology|last=Sally Ganchy|first=Sarah Gancher|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=1-4358-5066-1|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reciprocating engine developed in Europe during the 18th century, first as the [[atmospheric engine]] then later as the [[steam engine]]. These were followed by the [[Stirling engine]] and [[internal combustion engine]] in the 19th century. Today the most common form of reciprocating engine is the internal combustion engine running on the combustion of [[petrol]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG) or [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) and used to power [[motor vehicle]]s and [[engine power plant]]s.

One notable reciprocating engine from the World War II Era was the 28-cylinder, {{convert|3500|hp|kW|lk=in|abbr=on}} [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360]] "Wasp Major" radial engine. It powered the last generation of large piston-engined planes before jet engines and turboprops took over from 1944 onward. It had a total engine capacity of {{convert|71.5|L|cuin|abbr=on}}, and a high power-to-weight ratio.

The largest reciprocating engine in production at present, but not the largest ever built, is the [[Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C]]  turbocharged two-stroke diesel engine of 2006 built by [[Wärtsilä]]. It is used to power the largest modern container ships such as the [[Emma Mærsk]]. It is five stories high ({{convert|13.5|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), {{convert|27|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, and weighs over {{convert|2,300|metric ton|short ton}} in its largest 14 cylinders version producing more than 84.42&amp;nbsp;MW (114,800&amp;nbsp;bhp). Each cylinder has a capacity of {{convert|1,820|L|cuft|0|abbr=on}}, making a total capacity of {{convert|25,480|L|cuft|0|abbr=on}} for the largest versions.

== Engine capacity ==
For piston engines, an engine's capacity is the [[engine displacement]], in other words the volume swept by all the pistons of an engine in a single movement. It is generally measured in [[litre]]s (l) or cubic inches (c.i.d., cu&amp;nbsp;in, ''or'' in³) for larger engines, and cubic centimetres (abbreviated cc) for smaller engines. All else being equal, engines with greater capacities are more powerful and consumption of fuel increases accordingly (although this is not true of every Reciprocating engine), although power and fuel consumption are affected by many factors outside of engine displacement.

==Other modern non-internal combustion types==
Reciprocating engines that are powered by compressed air, steam or other hot gases are still used in some applications such as to drive many modern torpedoes or as pollution-free motive power. Most steam-driven applications use [[steam turbine]]s, which are more efficient than piston engines.

The French-designed FlowAIR vehicles use compressed air stored in a cylinder to drive a reciprocating engine in a local-pollution-free urban vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeropollutionmotors.us/ AIRPod] manufactured by MDI SA. Accessed February 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Torpedoes may use a working gas produced by [[high test peroxide]] or [[Otto fuel II]], which pressurise without combustion. The {{convert|230|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Mark 46 torpedo]], for example, can travel {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} underwater at {{convert|74|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} fuelled by Otto fuel without [[oxidant]].

==Reciprocating quantum heat engine==
[[Quantum heat engines]] are devices that generate power from heat that flows from a hot to a cold reservoir.
The mechanism of operation of the engine can be described by the laws of [[quantum mechanics]]. 
[[Quantum refrigerators]] are devices that consume power with the purpose to pump heat from a cold to a hot reservoir.

In a reciprocating quantum heat engine, the working medium is a quantum system such as spin systems or a harmonic oscillator.
The [[Carnot cycle]] and [[Otto cycle]] are the ones most studied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/8/5/083/fulltext/] Irreversible performance of a quantum harmonic heat engine, Rezek and Kosloff, New J. Phys. 8 (2006) 83&lt;/ref&gt;
The quantum versions obey the laws of [[thermodynamics]]. In addition, these models can justify the assumptions of
[[endoreversible thermodynamics]].
A theoretical study has shown that it is possible and practical to build a reciprocating engine that is composed of a single oscillating atom. This is an area for future research and could have applications in [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2012-11-car-built-particle.html Can a car engine be built out of a single particle?] Physorg,  November 30, 2012 by Lisa Zyga. Accessed 01-12-12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reisholz Rhine Powerline Crossing''' is a powerline crossing of Rhine River in [[Düsseldorf]] south of Holthausen substation, which was built in 1917 and originally part of the 110 kV-line between Reisholz Power Station and Goldenberg Power Station. This line was the first 110 kV-powerline of RWE. Later the line was transformed into a 220 kV line with 12 conductors arranged in 4 levels in an unusual double [[Two-level pylon|danube pylon]] mode.
The span width between the pylons, which are both {{convert|88|m|ft}} tall, is {{convert|375|m|ft}}. 
The pylon on the east side of Rhine River has a unique feature as under its legs a normal-gauge railway connecting Holthausen substation with the railway grid passes.

'''Sequential hermaphroditism''' (called '''dichogamy''' in [[botany]]) is a type of [[hermaphroditism]] that occurs in many [[fish]], [[gastropod]]s, and plants. Sequential hermaphroditism occurs when the individual changes sex at some point in its life. 

In animals, the different types of change are male to female ('''protandry'''), female to male ('''protogyny'''),&lt;ref name='Warner'/&gt; female to hermaphrodite ('''protogynous hermaphroditism'''), and male to hermaphrodite ('''protandrous hermaphroditism'''). Those that change gonadal sex can have both female and male germ cells in the [[gonad]]s or can change from one complete gonadal type to the other during their last life stage.&lt;ref name='carauth'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Freshwater cichlid ''Crenicara punctulata'' is a protogynous sequential hermaphrodite | journal=Copeia | year=2000 | first=L. L. | last=Carruth | volume=2000 | pages=71–82 | doi=10.1643/0045-8511(2000)2000[0071:fccpia]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In plants, individual flowers are called dichogamous if their function has the two sexes separated in time, although the plant as a whole may have functionally male and functionally female flowers open at any one moment. A flower is protogynous if its function is first female, then male, and protandrous if its function is male then female. It used to be thought that this reduced [[inbreeding]], but it may be a more general mechanism for reducing pollen-pistil interference.

==Zoology==

===Protandry===
[[File:Anemone purple anemonefish.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ocellaris clownfish]], ''Amphiprion ocellaris'', a protandrous animal species]]

Protandrous hermaphrodites are animals that are born male and at some point in their lifespan change sex to female. Protandrous animals include [[Amphiprioninae|clownfish]]. Clownfish have a very structured society. In the ''[[Amphiprioninae#Taxonomy|Amphiprion]] percula'' species, there are zero to four individuals excluded from breeding and a breeding pair living in a [[sea anemone]]. [[Dominance hierarchy|Dominance]] is based on size, the female being the largest and the male being the second largest. The rest of the group is made up of progressively smaller non-breeders, which have no functioning gonads.&lt;ref name='Buston p'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Territory inheritance in clownfish | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] | year=2004 | first=P. M | last=Buston | volume=271 | pages=s252-s254| id=| pmc=1810038 | pmid=15252999 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0156}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the female dies, the male gains weight and becomes the female for that group. The largest non-breeding fish then sexually matures and becomes the male of the group.&lt;ref name='Buston'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Does the Presence of Non-Breeders Enhance the Fitness of Breeders ? An Experimental Analysis in the Clown Anemonefish ''Amphiprion percula'' | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | year=2004 | first=P. | last=Buston | volume=57 | pages=23–31| id=| doi=10.1007/s00265-004-0833-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other protandrous fishes can be found in the classes [[clupeiformes]], [[siluriformes]], [[stomiiformes]], and within the perciform families [[pomacentridae]] and [[sparidae]]. Since these groups are distantly related and have many intermediate relatives that are not protandrous, it strongly suggests that protandry evolved multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avise|first1=J. C.|last2=Mank|first2=J. E.|title=Evolutionary Perspectives on Hermaphroditism in Fishes|journal=Sexual Development|date=2009|volume=3|issue=2–3|pages=152–163|doi=10.1159/000223079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of protandrous animals include:
* The [[ctenophore]] ''[[Coeloplana]] gonoctena''. In this organism the females are bigger than the males and are only found during the summer. In contrast males are found year-round.
* The flatworms ''[[Hymanella]] retenuova'' and ''[[Paravortex]] cardii''.
* ''[[Laevapex fuscus]]'', a [[gastropod]], is described as being functionally protandric. The [[sperm]] matures in late winter and early spring, the eggs mature in early summer, and [[copulation]] occurs only in June. This shows that males cannot reproduce until the females appear, thus why they are considered to be functionally protandric.&lt;ref name='Policansky'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Sex change in plants and animals | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | year=1982 | first=D. | last=Policansky | volume=13 | pages=471–495 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.002351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Russell-Hunter, W.

* ''[[Speyeria mormonia]]'', or the Mormon Fritillary, is a butterfly species exhibiting protandry.  In its case, functional protandry refers to the emergence of male adults 2–3 weeks before female adults.&lt;ref&gt;Sculley, Colleen E., and Carol L. Boggs.

===Protogyny===

Protogynous hermaphrodites are animals that are born female and at some point in their lifespan change sex to male. As the animal ages, based on internal or external triggers, it shifts sex to become a male animal. Male [[fecundity]] increases greatly with age, unlike female.

Protogyny is the most common form of hermaphroditism in fish in nature.&lt;ref name='Avise'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Evolutionary Perspectives on Hermaphroditism in Fishes | journal=Sexual Development | year=2009 | first=JC | last=Avise |author2=JE Mank  | volume=3 | pages=152–163| id=| doi=10.1159/000223079}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 75% of the 500 known sequentially hermaphroditic fish species are protogynous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pauly|first1=Daniel|title=Darwin's Fishes: An Encyclopedia of Ichthyology, Ecology, and Evolution|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139451819|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTDa0fM4vQIC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pandian|first=TJ|title=Genetic Sex Differentiation in Fish|year=2012|publisher=Science Publishers|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common model organisms for this type of sequential hermaphroditism are [[wrasses]]. They are one of the largest families of coral reef fish and belong to the family Labridae. Wrasses are found around the world in all marine habitats and tend to bury themselves in sand at night or when they feel threatened.&lt;ref name='Animal Planet'&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animal.discovery.com/guides/fish/marine/wrasseintro.html | title=Animal Planet :: Fish Guide -- Wrasse | accessdate=2011-03-28 | publisher=PetEducation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In wrasses, the larger of the two fish is the male, while the smaller is the female. In most cases, females and immature have a uniform color while the male has the terminal bicolored phase.&lt;ref name='Warner R'/&gt; Large males hold territories and try to pair spawn while small to mid-size initial-phase males live with females and group [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].&lt;ref name='Adreani'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Mating system and reproductive biology of a temperate wrasse, ''Halichoeres semicinctus'' | journal=Copeia | year=2008 | first=M.

In the [[California sheephead]] (''Semicossyphus pulcher''), a type of wrasse, when the female changes to male, the ovaries degenerate and spermatogenic crypts appear in the gonads. The general structure of the gonads remains ovarian after the transformation and the sperm is transported through a series of ducts on the periphery of the gonad and [[oviduct]]. Here sex change is age-dependent. For example, the California sheephead stays a female for four years before changing sex.&lt;ref name='Warner R'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The reproductive biology of the Protogynous hermaphrodite Pimelometopon Pulchrum (Pisces: Labridae). | journal=Fishery Bulletin | year=1975 | first=R.R | last=Warner | volume=73 | pages=261–283| id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thalassoma bifasciatum|Blue-headed wrasse]] begin life as males or females, but females can change sex and function as males. Young females and males start with a distinct coloration known as the "Initial Phase" before progressing into the "Terminal Phase" coloration, which has a change in intensity of color, stripes, and bars. Initial Phase males have larger [[testes]] than larger, terminal phase males, which enables the initial phase males to produce a large amount of sperm. This strategy is able to compete with that of the larger male, who is able to guard his own harem.

''[[Botryllus schlosseri]]'', a colonial [[tunicate]], is a protogynous hermaphrodite. In a colony, eggs are released about two days before the peak of sperm emission.&lt;ref name="pmid25044771"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gasparini F |author2=Manni L. |author3=Cima F. |author4=Zaniolo G |author5=Burighel P |author6=Caicci F |author7=Franchi N |author8=Schiavon F |author9=Rigon F |author10=Campagna D |author11=Ballarin L |title=Sexual and asexual reproduction in the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri |journal=Genesis |volume= 53|issue= |pages= 105–20| date=July  2014 |pmid=25044771 |doi=10.1002/dvg.22802 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although self-fertilization is avoided and cross-fertilization favored by this strategy, self-fertilization is still possible. Self-fertilized eggs develop with a substantially higher frequency of anomalies during cleavage than cross-fertilized eggs (23% vs. 1.6%).&lt;ref name="pmid25044771" /&gt;  Also a significantly lower percentage of larvae derived from self-fertilized eggs metamorphose, and the growth of the colonies derived from their metamorphosis is significantly lower.  These findings suggest that self-fertilization gives rise to inbreeding depression associated with developmental deficits that are likely caused by expression of deleterious recessive mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bernstein | first1=H. | last2=Hopf | first2=F.

===Ultimate causes===

The [[proximate and ultimate causation|ultimate cause]] of a biological phenomenon concerns why that phenomenon makes organisms better adapted to their environment, and thus why evolution by natural selection has produced that phenomenon. This is in contrast to proximate causes, which concern the molecular and physiological mechanisms that produce the phenomenon. A number of ultimate causes of hermaphroditism have been proposed, of which two are most relevant to sequential hermaphroditism.&lt;ref name='Ghiselin'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The evolution of hermaphroditism among animals | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | year=1969 | first=Michael T. |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin | last=Ghiselin | volume=44 | pages=189–208| id=| pmid=4901396 | issue=2 | doi=10.1086/406066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'size-advantage model' states that individuals of a given sex reproduce more effectively if they are a certain size or age. To create selection for sequential hermaphroditism, small individuals must have higher reproductive fitness as one sex and larger individuals must have higher reproductive fitness as the opposite sex. For example, eggs are larger than sperm, thus larger individuals are able to make more eggs, so individuals could maximize their reproductive potential by beginning life as male and then turning female upon achieving a certain size.&lt;ref name='Ghiselin'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sequential hermaphroditism can also protect against inbreeding in populations of organisms that have low enough motility and/or are sparsely distributed enough that there is a considerable risk of siblings encountering each other after reaching sexual maturity, and interbreeding. If siblings are all the same or similar ages, and if they all begin life as one sex and then transition to the other sex at about the same age, then siblings are highly likely to be the same sex at any given time. This should dramatically reduce the likelihood of inbreeding. Both protandry and protogyny are known to help prevent inbreeding in plants,{{cn|date=October 2018}} and many examples of sequential hermaphroditism attributable to inbreeding prevention have been identified in a wide variety of animals.&lt;ref name='Ghiselin'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[ectotherms]] body size and female fecundity are positively correlated.&lt;ref name='Warner'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Adaptive Significance of Sequential Hermaphroditism in Animals. | journal=The American Naturalist | year=1975 | first=R. R. | last=Warner | volume=109 | pages=61–82| id=| doi=10.1086/282974}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the size-advantage model. Kazancioglu and Alonzo (2010) performed the first comparative analysis of sex change in [[Labridae]]. Their analysis supports the size-advantage model and suggest that sequential hermaphroditism is correlated to the size-advantage. They determined that [[dioecy]] was less likely to occur when the size advantage is stronger than other advantages&lt;ref name='Alonzo'&gt;{{cite journal | title=A comparative analysis of sex change in Labridae supports the size advantage hypothesis | journal=Evolution; international journal of organic evolution | year=2010 | first=E | last=Kazancioğlu |author2=SH Alonzo  | volume=64 | pages=2254–64| id=| pmid=20394662 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01016.x | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Warner suggests that selection for protandry may occur in populations where female fecundity is augmented with age and individuals mate randomly. Selection for protogyny may occur where there are traits in the population that depress male fecundity at early ages (territoriality, mate selection or inexperience) and when female fecundity is decreased with age, the latter seems to be rare in the field.&lt;ref name='Warner'/&gt; An example of territoriality favoring protogyny occurs when there is a need to protect their habitat and being a large male is advantageous for this purpose. In the mating aspect, a large male has a higher chance of mating, while this has no effect on the female mating fitness.&lt;ref name='Alonzo'/&gt; Thus, he suggests that female fecundity has more impact on sequential hermaphroditism than the age structures of the population.&lt;ref name='Warner'/&gt;

The size-advantage model predicts that sex change would only be absent if the relationship between size/age with reproductive potential is identical in both sexes. With this prediction one would assume that hermaphroditism is very common, but this is not the case. Sequential hermaphroditism is very rare and according to scientists this is due to some cost that decreases fitness in sex changers as opposed to those who don’t change sex. Some of the hypotheses proposed for the dearth of hermaphrodites are the energetic cost of sex change, genetic and/or physiological barriers to sex change, and sex-specific mortality rates.&lt;ref name='Warner' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Charnov'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Size Advantage May Not Always Favor Sex Change | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | year=1986 | first=E | last=Charnov | volume=119 | pages=283–285| id=| pmid= | doi= 10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80141-2| issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Munday'&gt;{{cite journal | title=The energetic cost of protogynous versus protandrous sex change in the bi-directional sex changing fish Gobiodon histrio | journal=Marine Biology | year=2002 | first=P | last=Munday|author2=BW Molony  | volume=141 | pages=429–446| id=| pmid= | doi= 10.1007/s00227-002-0904-8| issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Kazanciglu and Alonzo found that dioecy was only favored when the cost of changing sex was very large. This indicates that the cost of sex change does not explain the rarity of sequential hermaphroditism by itself.&lt;ref name='Kazancioğlu'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Costs of changing sex do not explain why sequential hermaphroditism is rare | journal=The American Naturalist | year=2009 | first=E | last=Kazancioğlu |author2=SH Alonzo  | volume=173 | pages=327–36| id=| pmid=19199519 | doi=10.1086/596539 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proximate causes===

Many studies have focused on the proximate causes of sequential hermaphroditism. The role of [[aromatase]] has been widely studied in this area. Aromatase is an [[enzyme]] that controls the [[androgen]]/[[estrogen]] ratio in animals by catalyzing the conversion of [[testosterone]] into [[oestradiol]], which is irreversible. It has been discovered that the aromatase pathway mediates sex change in both directions.&lt;ref name='Kroon'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Aromatase pathway mediates sex change in each direction. | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] | year=2005 | first=F.

One such study was performed by Kobayashi et al. In their study they tested the role of estrogens in male three-spot wrasses (''Halichoeres trimaculatus''). They discovered that fish treated with aromatase inhibitors showed decreased gonodal weight, plasma estrogen level and spermatogonial proliferation in the testis as well as increased androgen levels. Their results suggest that estrogens are important in the regulation of [[spermatogenesis]] in this protogynous hermaphrodite.&lt;ref name='Kobayashi'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Role of estrogen in spermatogenesis in initial phase males of the three-spot wrasse (''Halichoeres trimaculatus''): wffect of aromatase inhibitor on the testis. | journal=Developmental Dynamics | year=2011 | first=y | last=Kobayashi |author2=Nozu R |author3=Nakamura M.  | volume=240 | pages=116–121| id=| url=https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-78650344417&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=847189402b2dcdb18259e2dc89206111 | accessdate=2011-04-27 | doi=10.1002/dvdy.22507 | pmid=21117145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic consequences===

Sequential hermaphrodites almost always have a sex ratio biased towards the birth sex, and consequently experience significantly more reproductive success after switching sexes. In theory, this should decrease [[genetic diversity]] and [[effective population size]] (Ne). However, a study of two ecologically similar [[Cheimerius|santer sea bream]] ([[gonochoric]]) and [[Chrysoblephus puniceus|slinger sea bream]] (protogynous) in South African waters found that genetic diversities were similar in the two species, and while Ne was lower in the instant for the sex-changer, they were similar over a relatively short time horizion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coscia |first1=I. |last2=Chopelet|first2=J. |last3=Waples|first3=R.

[[File:Aeonium protandry.jpg|thumb|Protandrous flowers of ''[[Aeonium undulatum]]'']]
In the context of the [[plant sexuality]] of flowering plants (angiosperms), there are two forms of dichogamy: '''''protogyny'''''&amp;mdash;female function precedes male function&amp;mdash;and '''''protandry'''''&amp;mdash;male function precedes female function.

Historically, dichogamy has been regarded as a mechanism for reducing [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref name=Darwin1862&gt;{{cite book |author=Darwin, Charles |title=On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilized by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing |publisher=John Murray |location=London |year=1862 |url=http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin3/orchids/orchids_fm.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215011429/http://pages.britishlibrary.net/charles.darwin3/orchids/orchids_fm.htm |archivedate=2006-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a survey of the angiosperms found that [[self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]] (SI) plants, which are incapable of inbreeding, were as likely to be dichogamous as were self-compatible (SC) plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2445372 |author=Bertin, R.I. |title=Incidence of monoecy and dichogamy in relation to self-fertilization in angiosperms |journal=Am.

Bot. |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=557–60 |year=1993 |jstor=2445372}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding led to a reinterpretation of dichogamy as a more general mechanism for reducing the impact of [[pollen]]-[[Carpel|pistil]] interference on pollen import and export.&lt;ref name=LloydWebb1986&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lloyd, D. G., Webb, C. J. |title=The avoidance of interference between the presentation of pollen and  stigmas in angiosperms: I. Dichogamy |journal=New Zeal. J.

Unlike the [[inbreeding avoidance]] hypothesis, which focused on female function, this interference-avoidance hypothesis considers both reproductive functions.

In many hermaphroditic species, the close physical proximity of [[anthers]] and  [[Carpel|stigma]] makes interference unavoidable, either within a  [[flower]] or between  flowers on an  [[inflorescence]]. Within-flower interference, which occurs when either the  pistil interrupts pollen removal or the  anthers prevent pollen deposition, can result in autonomous or facilitated self-pollination.&lt;ref name=LloydSchoen1992&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/297040 |author=Lloyd, D.

Protandry may be particularly relevant to this compromise, because it often results in an  inflorescence structure with female phase flowers positioned below male phase flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02856676 |author1=Bertin, R.

These effects of protandry on between-flower interference may decouple the benefits of large inflorescences from the consequences of geitonogamy and pollen discounting. Such a decoupling would provide a significant reproductive advantage through increased pollinator visitation and siring success.

Harder et al. (2000) demonstrated experimentally that dichogamy both reduced rates of self-fertilization and enhanced outcross siring success through reductions in geitonogamy and pollen discounting, respectively.&lt;ref name=Harderetal2000/&gt; Routley &amp; Husband (2003) examined the influence of inflorescence size on this siring advantage and found a bimodal distribution with increased siring success with both small and large display sizes.&lt;ref name=RoutleyHusband2003&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Routley, M.

A '''sieve''', or '''sifter''', is a device for separating wanted elements from unwanted material or for characterizing the particle size distribution of a sample, typically using a woven screen such as a mesh or net or metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ruhlman| first = Michael| last2 = Bourdain| first2 = Anthony| title = The Elements of Cooking: Translating the scientific use] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WXclAEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA278| year = 2007| publisher = Simon and Schuster| isbn = 978-1-4391-7252-0| page = 216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "sift" derives from "sieve".  In cooking, a sifter is used to separate and break up clumps in dry ingredients such as [[flour]], as well as to aerate and combine them. A '''strainer''' is a form of sieve used to separate solids from liquid.

==Industrial strainer==
Some industrial strainers available are simplex basket strainers, [[duplex strainers|duplex basket strainers]], and Y strainers. Simple basket strainers are used to protect valuable or sensitive equipment in systems that are meant to be shut down temporarily. Some commonly used strainers are bell mouth strainers, foot valve strainers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrialstrainer.com/eaton-hayward-strainers/|title=Industrial Strainers - Liquid Basket Strainer - Eaton Strainers|website=industrialstrainer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; basket strainers. Most processing industries (mainly pharmaceutical, coatings and liquid food industries) will opt for a self-cleaning strainer instead of a basket strainer or a simplex strainer due to limitations of simple filtration systems. The self-cleaning strainers or filters are more efficient and provide an automatic filtration solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russellfinex.com/en/news-and-events/replacing-bag-filters-with-russell-filters/|title=Replacing Bag Filters with Self Cleaning Filters - Russell Finex|first=Russell|last=Finex|website=www.russellfinex.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sieving==
Sieving is a simple technique for separating particles of different sizes. A sieve such as used for sifting flour has very small holes. Coarse particles are separated or broken up by grinding against one-another and screen openings. Depending upon the types of particles to be separated, sieves with different types of holes are used. Sieves are also used to separate stones from sand. Sieving plays an important role in food industries where sieves (often vibrating) are used to prevent the contamination of the product by foreign bodies. The design of the industrial sieve is here of primary importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powderprocess.net/Checking_Powder_sieve.html|title=Powder Checking - Vibrating sieve - Vibrating sifters - PowderProcess.net|website=www.powderprocess.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Triage]] sieving refers to grouping people according to their severity of injury.&lt;!-- is this Triage Sieve related to article?--&gt;

==Wooden sieves==

[[File:Wooden sieve one eighth mesh.PNG|thumb|right|A wooden mesh in which the withes were one eighth of an inch wide and set the same distance apart.  This would be used on an English farm of the Victorian era to sift grain, removing dust and soil.]]
The mesh in a wooden sieve might be made from wood or [[wicker]].  Use of wood to avoid contamination is important when the sieve is used for sampling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = B. De Vivo|author2=Harvey Belkin |author3=Annamaria Lima | title = Environmental Geochemistry: Site Characterization, Data Analysis and Case Histories: Site Characterization, Data Analysis and Case Histories| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FBn0iv8ILHIC&amp;pg=PA84| year = 2008| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-08-055895-0| page = 84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry Stephens, in his ''Book of the Farm'', advised that the [[withe]]s of a wooden [[riddle (tool)|riddle]] or sieve be made from [[fir]] or [[willow]] with [[American elm]] being best.  The rims would be made of fir, [[oak]] or, especially, [[beech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pages=414–416 |title=The Book of the Farm |volume=1 |author=Henry Stephens|publisher=W.

==US standard test sieve series==
A [[sieve analysis]] (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used (commonly used in [[civil engineering]] or [[sedimentology]]) to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material. Sieve sizes used in combinations of four to eight sieves.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4948">[[File:Silchester ogham.jpg|thumb|The Silchester stone illustrated in 1894, shortly after its discovery]]
The '''Silchester [[Ogham]] stone''' is a pillar stone discovered in [[Silchester]], [[Hampshire]] during excavations in 1893. Thus far it remains the only one of its kind found in England, and the only ogham inscription in England east of [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]].

==Background==

The pillar stone was found upside down some five to six feet beneath the surface, apparently at the bottom of a former well. A white metal or pewter vessel "of peculiar form" lay underneath, crushed by it. Further investigation revealed an [[ogham]] inscription upon the pillar. According to Amanda Clarke and [[Michael Fulford]] of the [[University of Reading]],

{{quote|The significance of the find as an isolated example of ogham some distance from the main British distribution in Devon and Cornwall and west of the River Severn was certainly appreciated at the time of the discovery. The stone and its inscription were reported on separately from the account of the excavation itself by Sir [[John Rhys]] in the year of the discovery. His reading, EBICATO[S]/[MAQ]I MUCO[I--], 'of Ebicatus, son of the tribe of', has been accepted up to now.&lt;ref name = "xxx"&gt;[https://www.reading.ac.uk/silchester/i3/victorians/vic_ogham.php Silchester Roman Town - The Insula IX Town Life Project The Victorian Excavations of 1893]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rhys noted that the sandstone marker was "rudely carved into what seems to me to be a phallic form", though the upper part was broken off and missing. What was left "may be described as the frustum of a cone, below which the stone narrows greatly, then widens into a moulded base." The inscription is in two lines beginning at the widest part of the frustum at its base.&lt;ref&gt;"Excavations on the site of the Roman city of Silchester, Hants in 1893", ''Archaeologia'' 54, January 1894, 199 - 238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
[[File:Britain.Deisi.Laigin.jpg|thumb|Map of Irish migration to Britain]]
The pewter vessel, when reconstructed, turned out to be "a simple, biconical flagon similar to a few other examples found in southern Britain which can be dated broadly to the fourth and no earlier than the late third century."&lt;ref name = "xxx"/&gt; The most recent version of the translation on the stone is "[The something] of Tebicatus, son of the tribe of N”. The missing word may be "memorial" or, less probably, "land", if the stone were a territorial marker rather than a grave marker. J. A. Baird argues that both archaeological and linguistic evidence suggest that the stone belongs to "the earliest phases of the ogham script", which emerges with contact between late Roman Latin and Old Irish.&lt;ref name = "bai"&gt;Baird, J. A., "Dura Dererta: The Death and Afterlife of Dura Europos", in ''Vrbes Extinctae: Archaeologies of Abandoned Classical Towns'', Ashgate, 2012, p.340.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of existing evidence, Reading University says that the "inscription has been interpreted as an epitaph and it has been variously dated to the fifth and sixth centuries".&lt;ref name = "xxx"/&gt; Baird says that it "could well date to the late fourth or fifth century". This would make it "one of the earliest ogham stones anywhere."&lt;ref name = "bai"/&gt;

==Significance==
The inscription was created during [[Sub-Roman Britain]], a period of intense cross-cultural contact between Britain and Ireland at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions. Most ogham inscriptions are present in the British strongholds of Cornwall, Devon and Wales. The Silchester inscription is in Hampshire — east of Devon — and is presumed to be the work of Irish settlers occupying land further east than other known Irish migrants. The tradition of the expulsion of the [[Déisi]] and their migration from Ireland may be related to this pattern of settlement and British-Irish cultural integration.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Kuno (Ed.) (1901). "The Expulsion of the Dessi". Y Cymmrodor 14: 101–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sweden  National Renewable Energy Action Plan''' is the [[National Renewable Energy Action Plan]] (NREAP) for [[Sweden]]. The plan was commissioned by the [[Directive 2009/28/EC]] which required [[Member States of the European Union]] to notify the [[European Commission]] with a road map. The report describes how Sweden planned to achieve its legally binding target of a 49% share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy by 2020. 

== Main targets in Sweden ==
In the NREAP, the Federal Government estimates the share of renewable energies in gross final energy consumption to be 50.2% in 2020. The share of renewable energies in the electricity sector will thereby amount to 62.8%, the share in the heating/cooling sector will be 62%, while in the transport sector it will amount to 12.4%.

== Main incentives and laws in Sweden ==
The Swedish licensing and legislative system is so structured that the Swedish Parliament and the Government govern through laws and regulations that are applied by national authorities that autonomously interpret and implement these laws and regulations. At a national level, there are regional government authorities and county administrative boards that have the task of coordinating and implementing the targets and mandates stipulated by the national authorities. 

'''Special for Wind Power''' 

There are four wind power coordinators and a national network for wind power within the area of wind power. Furthermore, the Swedish Energy Agency has, on behalf of the Government, developed an Internet-based manual about wind power (Vindlov.se) for all of the information that is needed for licensing matters regarding wind power and information on most things from concept stage to the commissioning of the completed wind farm. 

'''Special for Solar Power''' 

Solar heating installations need to meet certain quality standards in order to benefit from solar heating funding.

The '''tau''' (τ), also called the '''tau lepton''', '''tau particle''', or '''tauon''', is an [[elementary particle]] similar to the electron, with negative [[electric charge]] and a [[spin-½|spin of {{sfrac|1|2}}]]. Together with the [[electron]], the [[muon]], and the three [[neutrino]]s, it is a [[lepton]]. Like all elementary particles with half-integer spin, the tau has a corresponding [[antiparticle]] of opposite charge but equal [[mass]] and spin, which in the tau's case is the '''antitau''' (also called the ''positive tau''). Tau particles are denoted by {{SubatomicParticle|Tau-}} and the antitau by {{subatomicParticle|Tau+}}.

Tau leptons have a lifetime of {{val|2.9|e=-13|u=s}} and a [[mass]] of {{val|1776.82|u=MeV/c2}} (compared to {{val|105.7|u=MeV/c2}} for muons and {{val|0.511|u=MeV/c2}} for electrons).  Since their interactions are very similar to those of the electron, a tau can be thought of as a much heavier version of the electron.  Because of their greater mass, tau particles do not emit as much [[bremsstrahlung|bremsstrahlung radiation]] as electrons; consequently they are potentially highly penetrating, much more so than electrons.

Because of their short lifetime, the range of the tau is mainly set by their decay length, which is too small for bremsstrahlung to be noticeable. Their penetrating power appears only at ultra-high velocity / ultra-high energy (above [[PeV]] energies), when [[time dilation]] extends their path-length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D.

As with the case of the other charged leptons, the tau has an associated [[tau neutrino]], denoted by {{SubatomicParticle|Tau neutrino}}.

== History ==
The tau was anticipated in a 1971 paper by [[Yung-Su Tsai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Physical Review D |author-link=Yung-Su Tsai |first=Yung-Su |last=Tsai |date=1971-11-01 |volume=4 |issue=9 |page=2821 |title=Decay correlations of heavy leptons in e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → l&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + l&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; |df=dmy-all|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.4.2821 |bibcode = 1971PhRvD...4.2821T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providing the theory for this discovery, the tau was detected in a series of experiments between 1974 and 1977 by [[Martin Lewis Perl]] with his and Tsai's colleagues at the [[SLAC]]-[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|LBL]] group.&lt;ref name="Perl1975"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their equipment consisted of [[SLAC]]'s then-new {{SubatomicParticle|Antielectron}}– {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} colliding ring, called [[SPEAR]], and the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|LBL]] magnetic detector. They could detect and distinguish between leptons, hadrons and [[photon]]s. They did not detect the tau directly, but rather discovered anomalous events:

{{quote|We have discovered 64 events of the form

:{{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|Electron+-}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-+}} + at least two undetected particles

for which we have no conventional explanation.}}

The need for at least two undetected particles was shown by the inability to conserve energy and momentum with only one. However, no other muons, electrons, photons, or hadrons were detected. It was proposed that this event was the production and subsequent decay of a new particle pair:

:{{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|Antitau}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Tau}}  &amp;rarr; {{SubatomicParticle|Electron+-}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-+}} + 4{{SubatomicParticle|Neutrino}}

This was difficult to verify, because the energy to produce the {{SubatomicParticle|Antitau}}{{SubatomicParticle|Tau}} pair is similar to the threshold for [[D meson]] production. The mass and spin of the tau was subsequently established by work done at [[DESY]]-Hamburg with the Double Arm Spectrometer (DASP), and at SLAC-Stanford with the [[SPEAR]] Direct Electron Counter (DELCO),  

The symbol τ was derived from the Greek ''τρίτον'' (''triton'', meaning "third" in English), since it was the third charged lepton discovered.&lt;ref&gt;

Martin Lewis Perl shared the 1995 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Frederick Reines]]. The latter was awarded his share of the prize for experimental discovery of the [[neutrino]]. 

==Tau decay==
[[File:Feynman diagram of decay of tau lepton.svg|thumb|right|260px|[[Feynman diagram]] of the common decays of the tau by emission of an off-shell [[W boson]].]] 
The tau is the only lepton that can decay into [[hadron]]s – the other leptons do not have the necessary mass. Like the other decay modes of the tau, the hadronic decay is through the [[weak nuclear force|weak interaction]].&lt;ref name="NCP"&gt;{{Cite journal

The [[branching ratio]] of the dominant hadronic tau decays are:&lt;ref name="PDG"/&gt;
*25.52% for decay into a charged [[pion]], a neutral pion, and a tau neutrino;
*10.83% for decay into a charged pion and a tau neutrino;
*9.30% for decay into a charged pion, two neutral pions, and a tau neutrino;
*8.99% for decay into three charged pions (of which two have the same electrical charge) and a tau neutrino;
*2.70% for decay into three charged pions (of which two have the same electrical charge), a neutral pion, and a tau neutrino;
*1.05% for decay into three neutral pions, a charged pion, and a tau neutrino.

In total, the tau lepton will decay hadronically approximately 64.79% of the time.

Since the [[lepton number|tauonic lepton number]] is conserved in weak decays, a [[tau neutrino]] is always created when a tau decays.&lt;ref name="NCP"/&gt;

The [[branching ratio]] of the common purely leptonic tau decays are:&lt;ref name="PDG"/&gt;
*17.82% for decay into a tau neutrino, electron and electron antineutrino;
*17.39% for decay into a tau neutrino, muon and muon antineutrino.
The similarity of values of the two branching ratios is a consequence of [[lepton universality]].

== Exotic atoms ==
The tau lepton is predicted to form [[exotic atom]]s like other charged subatomic particles. One of such, called '''tauonium''' by the analogy to [[muonium]], consists of an antitauon and an electron: {{SubatomicParticle|Tau+}}{{SubatomicParticle|Electron}}.&lt;ref name="Brodsky"/&gt;

Another one is an [[onium]] atom {{SubatomicParticle|Tau+}}{{SubatomicParticle|Tau-}} called ''true tauonium'' and is difficult to detect due to tau's extremely short lifetime at low (non-relativistic) energies needed to form this atom. Its detection is important for [[quantum electrodynamics]].&lt;ref name="Brodsky"&gt;

'''''The Idiot Cycle''''' is a 2009 French-Canadian documentary which alleges that six major chemical companies are responsible for decades of cancer causing chemicals and pollution, and also develop cancer treatments and drugs.  It also argues these companies own the most patents on [[genetically modified crops]] that have never been tested for long term health impacts like cancer.

==Production==
The film was shot in Canada (Sarnia, Ottawa, Toronto, ON and Saskatoon, SK), the United States (Memphis, TN, Midland, MI, and Washington DC), The Netherlands (Amsterdam), France (Agen, Paris), Italy (Bologna), Germany (Weilheim, Frankfurt, Bad Neihum, Burladingen, Tübingen), Belgium (Brussels), England (London, Hemel Hempstead), and Northern Ireland (Coleraine).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">The '''United States Oil &amp; Gas Association''', formerly the '''Mid-Continent Oil &amp; Gas Association,''' is a [[trade association]] which [[petroleum lobbying|promotes]] the well-being of the [[oil and gas industry|oil and natural gas industries]] in the [[United States]]. Primarily, the organization focuses on the production of these resources. Other organizations exist to deal with concerns of transportation, refining and processing, and other discrete functions of the fossil fuel industry.

==Early history==
The predecessor organization, '''Mid-Continent Oil &amp; Gas Association,''' was founded on October 13, 1917, after the entry of the United States into [[World War I]], in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]], which called itself "The Oil Capital of the World".&lt;ref name=texas/&gt;&lt;ref name=okla/&gt; At its creation, the association worked to provide [[petroleum]] to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces. In the decades since its establishment, the association is recognized as a leading advocate for producers of domestic oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usoga.org/en/about_us/history/|title=A Brief History|publisher=usoga.org|accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State-level affiliates==
Beginning in 1919, local divisions of the association were created in several states.&lt;ref name=texas/&gt;The Oklahoma-[[Kansas]] Division was established that year under the leadership of [[Frank Phillips (oil industrialist)|Frank Phillips]], a founder of [[Phillips Petroleum Company]], as well as oil company entrepreneurs [[William Skelly|William G. Skelly]] of Tulsa and [[H. H. Champlin]] of [[Enid, Oklahoma|Enid]], Oklahoma. [[E. W. Marland]], whose company became [[Conoco|Conoco, Inc.]], was later the [[governor of Oklahoma]] from 1935-1939. [[Alfred M. Landon]], later the [[governor of Kansas]] from 1935-1939 and the [[U.S. presidential election, 1936|1936]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[U.S. president|presidential]] [[Candidate|nominee]], was also instrumental in the establishment of the Oklahoma-Kansas division.&lt;ref name=okla&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okmoga.com/html/history.php|title=Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association of Oklahoma|publisher=okmoga.com|accessdate=May 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228040415/http://www.okmoga.com/html/history.php|archive-date=February 28, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of June 2018, Bloomberg, LP, lists Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association of Oklahoma, Inc. located at 6701 North Broadway, Suite 300 Oklahoma City, OK 73116, and states that its business is to, "... support legislation for the energy industry at the Oklahoma State Capitol and to provide education programs and seminars.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0374169Z:US-mid-continent-oil-&amp;-gas-association-of-oklahoma-inc Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association of Oklahoma, Inc.-Private Company."

The Louisiana Oil and Gas Association was founded in 1923, with emphasis in Louisiana and the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]]. Headed by its president, former [[U.S. Representative]] [[Chris John]] of [[Louisiana's 7th congressional district]], since disbanded, LMOGA represents companies involved in exploration and production, refining, transportation, and marketing as well as other firms in the fields of engineering, environment, finance, law, and government relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/company/louisiana-mid-continent-oil-and-gas-association|title=Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association|publisher=linkedin.com|accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valdecaballeros Nuclear Power Plant''' is an abandoned [[nuclear power plant]] in the [[Valdecaballeros]] municipality, [[Badajoz Province]], [[Extremadura]], [[Spain]]. It was under construction in 1983 when the Spanish nuclear power expansion program was cancelled following a change of government. Its two [[BWR]]s, each of 975 MWe, were [[wikt:mothballed|mothballed]], one 60% complete and the other 70% complete. In 1994, the decision was taken that the plant would not be completed.

A '''velocity receiver''' ('''velocity sensor''') is a sensor that responds to velocity rather than absolute position. For example, [[dynamic microphones]] are velocity receivers. Likewise, many [[electronic keyboard]]s used for music are velocity sensitive, and may be said to possess a velocity receiver in each key.  Most of these function by measuring the time difference between switch closures at two different positions along the travel of each key.

There are two types of velocity receivers, moving coil and piezoelectric. The former contains a coil supported by springs and a permanently fixed magnet and require no output signal amplifiers. Movement causes the coil to move relative to the magnet, which in turn generates a voltage that is proportional to the velocity of that movement.

[[Piezoelectric sensor]] velocity receivers are similar to a piezoelectric [[accelerometer]], except that the output of the device is proportional to the velocity of the transducer. Unlike the moving coil variety, piezoelectric sensors will likely require an amplifier due to the small generated signal.

The '''Volkswagen Golf''' ({{Audio|GT VW-Golf.ogg|listen}}) is a [[compact car]] produced by the German automotive manufacturer [[Volkswagen]] since 1974, marketed worldwide across seven generations, in various body configurations and under various [[nameplate]]s – such as the '''Volkswagen Rabbit''' in the United States and Canada (Mk1 and Mk5), and as the '''Volkswagen Caribe''' in Mexico (Mk1).

The original Golf Mk1 was a [[front-wheel drive]], front-engined replacement for the [[air-cooled]], rear-engined, rear-wheel drive [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. Historically, the Golf is Volkswagen's best-selling model and is among the [[List of automobile sales by model|world's top three best-selling models]], with more than 30 million built by June 2013.&lt;ref name=VWG30mi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/06/wolfsburg-20130614.html|title=30 millionth VW Golf rolls off assembly line in Wolfsburg |author= |publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=14 June 2013|accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carmagazine.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |author=Gareth Kent |title=VW Golf build passes 25 million |work=carmagazine.co.uk |date=30 March 2007 |url= http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/News/Search-Results/Industry-News/VW-Golf-build-passes-25-million-/?&amp;R=EPI-3666 |accessdate=11 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, most Golf production was in the 3-door [[hatchback]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Figures for 1974-1987: 4,700,000 3-door models, 2,550,000 5-door models, according to: {{cite book|title=Deutsche Autos 1945–1990, vol.3|last=Oswald |first=Werner|year=2001|publisher=Motorbuch Verlag|location= Stuttgart|isbn=3-613-02116-1|pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other variants include a 5-door hatchback, [[station wagon]] (Variant, from 1993), [[convertible]] ([[Volkswagen Golf Mk1#Golf Cabriolet|Cabriolet]] and [[Volkswagen Golf Mk3#Cabriolet|Cabrio]], 1979–2002, [[Volkswagen Golf Mk6#Cabriolet|Cabriolet]], 2011–present), and a Golf-derived [[notchback]] [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]], variously called [[Volkswagen Jetta]], [[Volkswagen Vento]] (from 1992) or [[Volkswagen Bora (1999)|Volkswagen Bora]] (from 1999). The cars have filled many market segments, from being a basic, everyday car, to high-performance [[hot hatch]]es.

The Volkswagen Golf has won many awards throughout its history. The Golf won the [[World Car of the Year]] in 2009, with the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk6]] and in 2013 with the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk7]]. The VW Golf is one of only three cars, the others being the [[Renault Clio]] and Opel/Vauxhall Astra, to have been voted European Car of the Year twice, in 1992 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automotoportal.com/article/Top_5_Worlds_Most_Successful_Cars_Ever "Top 5 World’s Most Successful Cars Ever"], Automotoportal.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1992_1/coty |title=Previous Winners |language=es |publisher=Car of the Year |date= |accessdate=9 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031044912/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1992_1/coty |archivedate=31 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Volkswagen Golf has made the annual [[Car and Driver 10Best]] list multiple times. The [[Volkswagen Golf Mk7|Golf Mk7]] won the [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]] award in 2015, and the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|Mk1]] GTI also won the award in 1985.

Later Golf variations included the Golf GTI (introduced in June 1976 with a fuel-injected 1.6-litre engine capable of {{convert|180|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}), a diesel-powered version (from September 1976), the [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta]] notchback saloon version (from October 1979), the Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet (from January 1980) and a Golf-based pickup, the [[Volkswagen Caddy]].

The '''Golf Mk1''' was sold as the '''Volkswagen Rabbit''' in the United States and Canada and as the '''Volkswagen Caribe''' in Mexico.

A facelifted version of the Golf Mk1 was produced in South Africa as the '''[[Volkswagen Citi Golf|Citi Golf]]''' from 1984 to 2009.&lt;ref name="C4Wauto-4411956"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://topcar.co.za/user-generated/goodbye-citi-golf/ |title=Goodbye Citi Golf &amp;#124; TopCar |work=topcar.co.za |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2014 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320062853/http://topcar.co.za/user-generated/goodbye-citi-golf/ |archivedate=20 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Volkswagen Golf Mk2}}

September 1983 saw the introduction of the second-generation '''Golf (Mk2)''' that grew slightly in terms of wheelbase, exterior and interior dimensions, while retaining, in a more rounded form, the Mk1's overall look. Although it was available on the home market and indeed most other left-hand drive markets by the end of 1983, it was not launched in the UK until March 1984. 

The Mk2 GTI featured a 1.8-litre 8-valve fuel-injected engine from its launch, with a 16-valve version capable of more than {{convert|220|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} being introduced in 1985.

In 1985, the first Golfs with four-wheel-drive (Golf Syncro) went on sale with the same Syncro four-wheel-drive system being employed on the [[G-Lader#Sizes and car models|supercharged G60 models]], exclusively released in continental Europe in 1989 with {{convert|120|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} and anti-lock brakes (ABS).

A Mk2-based second generation Jetta was unveiled in January 1984. There was no Mk2-based cabriolet model; instead, the Mk1 Cabriolet was continued over the Mk2's entire production run.

{{Main article|Volkswagen Golf Mk3}}

The third-generation '''Golf (Mk3)''' made its home-market début in August 1991 and again grew slightly in comparison with its immediate predecessor, while its wheelbase remained unchanged.

New engines included the first [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TD) [[diesel engine]] in a Golf, and a narrow-angle 2.8-litre [[VR6 engine]]. US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel consumption estimates are {{convert|9.0|L/100 km|mpgimp mpgus|abbr=on}} (city) and {{convert|7.4|L/100 km|mpgimp mpgus|abbr=on}} (highway), with {{convert|261|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} per tank (city) and {{convert|363|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} per tank (highway). For the first time ever, a Golf estate (Golf Variant) joined the line-up in September 1993 (although most markets did not receive this model until early 1994). At the same time, a completely new Mk3-derived [[Convertible (car)|Cabriolet]] was introduced, replacing the 13-year-old Mk1-based version with one based on the Mk3 Golf platform from 1995 to early 1999. The Mk3 Golf Cabrio received a Mk4-style facelift in late 1999 and was continued until 2002.

The notchback version, called VW Vento (or Jetta in North America), was presented in January 1992.

It was [[European Car of the Year]] for 1992, ahead of the new Citroën [[Citroën ZX|ZX]] and General Motors' new Opel [[Opel Astra|Astra]] model.

The Mk3 continued to be sold until 1999 in the United States, Canada and parts of South America, also in Mexico as a special edition called "Mi" (basically a Golf CL 4-door with added air conditioning, special interior, original equipment (OEM) black-tinted rear brake lights, and anti-lock brakes (ABS), but without a factory-fitted radio). The "i" in "Mi" is coloured red, which designates that multi-point fuel injection was equipped and the 1.8-litre engine was upgraded to  2.0-litres.

{{Main article|Volkswagen Golf Mk4}}

The '''Golf Mk4''' was first introduced in August 1997, followed by a notchback version (VW Bora or, in North America, again VW Jetta) in August 1998 and a new Golf Variant (estate) in March 1999. There was no Mk4-derived Cabriolet, although the Mk3 Cabriolet received a facelift in late 1999 that consisted of bumpers, grill and headlights similar to those of the Mark IV models.

As with the earlier three versions of the Golf, the UK market received each version several months later than the rest of Europe. The hatchback version was launched there in the spring of 1998 and the estate some 12 months later (around the same time as the Bora).

New high-performance models included the 3.2-litre [[VR6 engine|VR6]]-engined [[4Motion|four-wheel-drive]] Golf "R32" introduced in 2002, its predecessor, the 2.8-litre [[VR6 engine|VR6]]-engined "Golf V6 [[4Motion]]" (succeeding the 2.9-litre Mk3 "Golf [[VR6 engine|VR6]] [[4Motion|Syncro]]"), as well as the famous 1.8T (turbo) 4-cylinder used in various Volkswagen Group models.

As of 2008, certain variants of the Golf/Bora Mk4 were still in production in Brazil, China, and Mexico. Revised versions of the Mk4 were sold in Canada marketed as the Golf City and Jetta City from 2007 to 2010. The two models were VW Canada's entry-level offerings. They received a significant refresh for the 2008 model year, including revised headlamps, taillamps, front and rear fascias, sound systems, and wheels. Both models were offered only with the 2.0-litre, 8-valve single over-head cam (SOHC) [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] gasoline engine, rated at {{convert|86|kW|hp PS||abbr=on}}. They were the only entry-level offerings with an optional six-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] transmission. Production of the European variant of the Golf Mk4 ceased at the end of the 2003 model year. Production of the U.S. version ended in 2006.

When the Chinese market Bora received a July 2006 facelift, the Golf did too, becoming the "Bora HS" in the process.

The Mk4's popularity and low cost has allowed it to remain in production in several countries, including Brazil and Argentina, with minor cosmetic changes.

{{Main article|Volkswagen Golf Mk5}}

The '''Golf Mk5''' was introduced in Europe in the autumn of 2003, reaching the UK market in early 2004. In North America, Volkswagen brought back the '''Rabbit''' nameplate when it introduced the vehicle in 2006. In Canada, the Golf is still the prevalent nameplate of the fifth generation (though both Rabbit and Golf have both been used historically). The North American base model is powered by a 2.5-litre five-cylinder engine, which produced {{convert|112|kW|hp PS|abbr=on}} in 2006 and 2007, but was upped to {{convert|127|kW|hp PS|abbr=on}} in the later models. A [[Grand Tourer Injection|GTI]] version is powered by a turbocharged version of the 2.0-litre FSI engine, producing {{Convert|147|kW|hp PS|abbr=on}}.

Volkswagen also introduced the "Fast" marketing idea for the US market, "dedicated to the 'fast' that lives inside every driver". Drivers who purchased new GTI Mk5s from a dealership were shipped a model of said Fast (a plastic figurine), which employs GTI-like features. The GTI version is the only version on sale in Mexico.

The saloon/sedan version, again called Volkswagen Jetta in most markets, is assembled in Germany, South Africa, as well as Mexico. (In Mexico this car is known as Bora.) It was followed in 2004 by a new Golf Variant. The front ends of the car are the same, with the only difference being that the GLI is a sedan, while the GTI is a hatchback.

Later models of the Mk5 introduced the 1.4-litre TSI [[turbocharged]] petrol engine with front-wheel drive.

In a comparison test conducted by ''[[Car and Driver]]'' Magazine, the Volkswagen Rabbit S was named the winner among eight small cars. While it was praised for its excellent driving position, fine instruments, and strong engine, it was criticized for having high levels of road noise, uncomfortable seats, and poor fuel economy. Though, the final verdict stated, "This one is all about driving pleasure, so it wins." The Rabbit also placed first in their final comparison in December 2006.

[[File:2010 Volkswagen Golf S TDi 1.6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Volkswagen Golf TDI (United Kingdom)]]

Volkswagen based the '''Golf Mk6''' on the existing [[Volkswagen Group A platform#A5|PQ35 platform]] from the Golf Mk5.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121295991392455457 VW to Cut Costs to Produce Golf] 9 June 2008; pg B2&lt;/ref&gt; This vehicle was debuted at the [[2008 Paris Motor Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autobild.de/artikel/erste-fotos-vom-vw-golf-vi_759923.html|title=Erste Fotos vom VW Golf VI – Das ist der neue Golf – News|publisher=autobild.de |accessdate=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mk6 Golf was designed by Volkswagen's chief designer [[Walter de'Silva]].  The design is said to be more aerodynamic, helping fuel efficiency, and is quieter than its predecessor. Following criticism of the downgraded interior trim quality of the Mk5 Golf in comparison to the Mk4, Volkswagen opted to overhaul the interior to match the quality with the Mk4 Golf, while maintaining the same user friendliness from the Mk5. The car is also cheaper to build than its predecessor; Volkswagen claims it consequently will be able to pass these savings on to the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatcar.com/news-special-report.aspx?NA=234338&amp;EL=3253020| title=New VW Golf revealed – Introduction – Car and Car-Buying News – What Car?|publisher=Whatcar.com |date=6 August 2008|accessdate=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mk6 Jetta was released in Mexico in mid-2010, and by late 2011 it was available in all markets.
[[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] [[diesel engine]]s which uses [[common rail]] injection technology replaced the longstanding Pumpe Düse (PD) [[Unit Injector]] system. New on the Golf is the optional Volkswagen Adaptive Chassis Control (not available in the North American market), which allows the driver to select between 'normal', 'comfort' and 'sports' modes, which will vary the suspension, steering and accelerator behavior accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tan |first=Paul |url=http://paultan.org/archives/2008/08/06/6th-generation-volkswagen-golf-details-and-photos/ |title=6th Generation Volkswagen Golf Details and Photos |publisher=Paultan.org |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mk6 Golf is available with both 5- and 6-speed [[manual transmission]], and 6- or 7-speed Direct-Shift Gearbox  ([[Direct-Shift Gearbox|DSG]])(with [[Dual clutch transmission|Dual Clutch]]) transmission options. In North America, the Mk5 version was originally sold as the Rabbit from 2006 to 2009. In 2010, Volkswagen brought back the Golf nameplate with the mid-cycle refresh. With it came a {{convert|130|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}}, 2.5-litre inline 5-cylinder with 240&amp;nbsp;N·m (177&amp;nbsp;lb·ft) of torque and a 2.0-litre, {{convert|100|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} turbocharged inline 4-cylinder clean diesel engine that generates 320&amp;nbsp;N·m (236&amp;nbsp;lb·ft) of torque. The GTI version is equipped with a {{convert|157|kW|hp PS|abbr=on}} turbocharged inline 4-cylinder TSI gasoline engine while the Golf R has a {{convert|191|kW|hp PS|abbr=on}} turbocharged TFSI inline 4 engine. All three engines can be paired with a DSG dual-clutch 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmission in either a 3- or 5-door configuration.

The car was introduced for sale in the UK in January 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.cars.yahoo.com/06082008/62/volkswagen-golf-mark-6-unveiled-0.html|title=Volkswagen Golf Mark-6-unveiled|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Uk.cars.yahoo.com|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in North America in October 2009 as the 2010 Golf, rather than Rabbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Garrett J |title=VW kills Rabbit name, again |work=New York Times |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/vw-kills-rabbit-name-again/ |date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mk6 also reintroduced a diesel engine option to the North American market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automoblog.net/2010/08/06/2010-vw-golf-tdi-review/ |title=2010 VW Golf TDI Review |publisher=Automoblog.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the GTI dubbed the GTI Clubsport making {{convert|195|kW|hp PS|abbr=on}} was released in 2016. A variant of the Clubsport called the Clubsport S held the record for the fastest front-wheel-drive car around the [[Nürburgring]], until the 2017 Honda Civic Type-R took the record once again.

The Golf line is available in all the relevant drive systems: the Golf TSI, including GTI, is petrol-powered; Golf TDI diesel (Turbo Direct Injection), including GTD, is diesel-powered; the Golf TGI is powered by [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG); the e-Golf is powered by electricity; and the Golf GTE is a [[plug-in hybrid]]. The use of a modular transverse matrix assembly kit enables the manufacturing of Golf models with gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electric and hybrid drives from bumper to bumper at Volkswagen factories.&lt;ref name="VW_GTE"/&gt;

In November 2016, Volkswagen revealed a facelifted version (Golf 7.5) to the 3-door hatchback, 5-door hatchback, 5-door estate, GTI and GTE, in addition to a new "R-Line" Golf. With those models, comes a new economical engine: 1.5-litre TSI EVO which produces {{convert|97|kW|hp PS|abbr=on}} or {{convert|110|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} and replaces the 1.4-litre TSI. The updated GTI version now features a 230 hp as standard (220&amp;nbsp;hp previously) or 247&amp;nbsp;hp in the optional performance pack (230&amp;nbsp;hp previously).
In terms of interior technology, the Golf now features a 12.3" TFT display as an option that is similar to [[Audi]] models and known as "Virtual Cockpit", full LED lights, animated tail indicators as an option (also used in Audi models), etc.

The most powerful Golf in the range is the Golf R. Built as a 3 or 5 door hatchback, it is powered by a newly developed version of the {{cvt|1984|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[turbocharged]] [[List of Volkswagen Group petrol engines#2.0 R4 16v TSI/TFSI (EA888)|EA888]] [[Gasoline direct injection|petrol FSI]] [[Inline-four engine]] used in the latest Golf GTI (and Audi S3), but in this application producing {{cvt|300|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} ({{cvt|206|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} for "hot climate" markets such as Australia, South Africa, Japan, USA) from 5,500 to 6,200 rpm and {{cvt|380|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} from 1,800 to 5,500 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-reviews/volkswagen/vw-golf-r-2014-review/|title=VW Golf R 2014 review|date=February 4, 2014|editor=Georg Kacher|website=carmagazine.co.uk|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 0-62&amp;nbsp;mph (100 km/h) takes 5.1 seconds (versus 5.7 seconds for previous Golf R), or 4.9 seconds with optional DSG gearbox.

[[File:VW Golf CityStromer ( 1070567-HDR).jpg|thumb|Golf III CityStromer]]

The VW Golf has had several generations made into electric ''CityStromer'' models. The first of these was in the 1970s, when VW took a standard Golf Mk1 and converted it to electric power. By the time the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk2|Golf Mk2]] came into production a limited number of electric Golfs were made, using [[lead–acid battery]] packs and a custom-made motor and controller{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. VW continued with the production of limited numbers of CityStromer electric cars with the introduction of the Golf Mk3. The electric CityStromer Mk3 included a [[Siemens]]-based AC drive system, and lead–acid battery packs. They had a maximum speed of {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} and a range of approximately {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citystromer.cz/index_en.html |title=CitySTROMer |publisher=Citystromer.cz |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a few exceptions, only left-hand drive Golfs were converted by VW into Citystromer models. These vehicles are still used today and have popularity in mainland Europe with only a few present in Great Britain. Only two right-hand drive Mk2 CityStromers were built for the UK market and it is believed only one remains today. It is owned by EV advocate and broadcaster [[Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield]], host of Transport Evolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aminorjourney.com/journal/2009/11/13/aminorjourneycom-on-positivetv.html The CityStromer EV on PositiveTV]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golf Variant Twin Drive===
As part of the "Fleet study in electric mobility" project that began in 2008, VW developed 20 Golf Variant twinDRIVE [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s. These research vehicles have an [[all-electric range]] of {{Convert|57|km|abbr=on}} and the [[internal combustion engine]] provides for a total range of {{Convert|900|km||0|abbr=on}}. The plug-in hybrid drive of the Golf Variant twinDRIVE is equipped with either an 11.2&amp;nbsp;[[kWh]] or a 13.2&amp;nbsp;kWh [[lithium-ion battery]] pack, as Volkswagen is testing packs from two vendors. Ten vehicles are equipped with batteries from the American-German manufacturer GAIA with [[cathode]] type nickel cobalt aluminium dioxide (NCA). The other ten are powered by lithium-ion batteries with [[Lithium-ion battery#High power cathode using lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC)|nickel manganese cobalt]] (NMC) cathodes from the Korean-German joint venture SB LiMotive ([[Samsung]] and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]). These 10 vehicles have been in use since early 2011. Both battery systems offer high power and energy density. They each weigh about 150&amp;nbsp;kg. The [[gasoline engine]] is used to support the electric heating system when outdoor temperatures are low.&lt;ref name=GCC0611&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/06/vw-20110629.html|title=Volkswagen presents status of fleet study in electromobility; latest generation of twïnDRIVE plug-in hybrid|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=29 June 2011|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using guidelines for determining the fuel consumption of plug-in hybrids, VW estimates a fuel consumption of 2.1&amp;nbsp;L/100&amp;nbsp;km (112&amp;nbsp;mpg US), which is equivalent to 49&amp;nbsp;g/km CO2. When the battery is fully charged, the Golf Variant twinDRIVE is designed to maximize the share of pure electrical energy used for driving, and only when longer distances are driven does the share of supplemental gasoline fuel increase. Top speed of the car is {{Convert|170|km/h||0|abbr=on}} and it accelerates to 100&amp;nbsp;km/h (62 mph) in under 12&amp;nbsp;seconds. When operated in pure electric mode, the Golf Variant twinDRIVE can reach a top speed of {{Convert|120|km/h||0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=GCC0611/&gt;

The production version was expected to be based on Mk6 Golf featuring a 1.5&amp;nbsp;L turbodiesel engine and electric motor, with estimated arrival date of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vijayenthiran |first=Viknesh |url=http://www.motorauthority.com/volkswagen-twin-drive-plug-in-hybrids-not-due-until-2015.html |title=VW Twin Drive plug-in hybrids not due until 2015 |publisher=Motorauthority.com |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[SEAT León]] prototype with the Twin Drive system was also under development.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In February 2017, Volkswagen announced an updated version of the 2017 model year e-Golf which includes improved range, better fuel economy, and more power than the outgoing model. With a new 35.8 kWh lithium-ion battery, the upgraded car is said to achieve an EPA-estimated range of {{convert|144|to|201|km|abbr=on}}, and have a combined 119 MPGe. The 2017 e-Golf also provides a faster charging time; SE and SEL Premium trim levels have a 7.2 kW unit that allows the battery to be fully charged in under six hours at a 240 V charging station. There is an optional (standard on SEL Premium) DC Fast Charging feature that allows the car to be charged to 80% in only an hour at a DC fast charging station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Carl Anthony |title=2017 VW e-Golf Improves Strongly Over 2016 Model |publisher=Automoblog.net |date=22 February 2017 |url= http://www.automoblog.net/2017/02/22/2017-vw-e-golf-improves-strongly-2016-model/ |accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DC fast charging function is notably limited to 2 consecutive uses, since the battery can otherwise overheat (the vehicle is designed with passive battery cooling only). This makes the vehicle unsuitable for convenient long distance highway journeys over 220 miles or so at normal highway speeds.

[[File:Volkswagen Golf GTE Sport - IAA 2015.jpg|thumb|Volkswagen Golf GTE Sport at the IAA 2015]]
The Golf GTE is a [[plug-in hybrid]] version of the Golf hatchback unveiled at the 2014 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. The Golf GTE shares the basic powertrain hardware with the [[Audi A3 Sportback e-tron]] but the software controls are different.&lt;ref name=VWemobility&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/03/20140313-golf.html|title=Volkswagen: e-mobility and sustainability; Part 1, the e-Golf and Golf GTE |author=Mike Millikin |publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=13 March 2014|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Golf GTE also shares the same plug-in hybrid powertrain with the [[Volkswagen Passat GTE]], but the Passat has a larger 9.9 kWh Li-ion battery pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/09/20140929-passatgte-1.html|title=Promised VW Passat plug-in hybrid to debut at Paris show; both sedan and wagon|author=Mike Millikin|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=29 September 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GTE is powered by a 1.4-litre (148&amp;nbsp;hp, 110&amp;nbsp;kW) TSI direct-injection gasoline engine combined with a 75 [[kW]] [[electric motor]] powered by a 8.8 [[kWh]] [[lithium-ion battery]], enabling the plug-in hybrid to deliver an [[all-electric range]] of {{Convert|50|km|abbr=on}} and a total range of {{Convert|933|km|abbr=on}}. The [[all-electric mode]] can be activated at the push of a button. Under the [[New European Driving Cycle]], combined fuel economy is {{Convert|157|mpgUS|L/100km|abbr=on|order=flip}} equivalent. The Golf GTE has a top speed of {{Convert|135|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} and accelerates from {{Convert|0|to|62|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 7.6&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2014/02/20/vw-golf-gte-plug-in-hybrid-geneva-official/|title=VW Golf GTE plugs in the GTI for guilt-free fun|author=Noah Joseph|publisher=[[Autoblog.com]]|date=20 February 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wagonette''' (''little wagon'') is a small [[horse-drawn vehicle|horsecar]] with [[leaf spring|springs]], which has two benches along the right and left side of the platform, people facing each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gloriaaustin.com/wagonettes.html Modern day wagonettes]&lt;/ref&gt; The driver sits on a separate, front-facing bench. A wagonette may be open or have a tilt. A large horse-drawn enclosed vehicle with spring-suspension, a similar arrangement of the seats and obligatory [[roof]] is called an [[horsebus]].

The 1914 book ''Motor Body-building in All Its Branches'' by Christopher William Terry, defined a [[shooting-brake]] as a wagonette provided with game and gun racks and accommodation for ammunition.&lt;ref name="motorbody"&gt;{{cite book
