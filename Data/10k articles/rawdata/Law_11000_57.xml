The '''Animal Rights Militia''' ('''ARM''') is a banner used by [[animal rights]] activists who engage in [[direct action]] utilizing a [[diversity of tactics]] that ignores the [[Animal Liberation Front]]'s policy of taking all necessary precautions to avoid harm to human life.&lt;ref name="NC001"&gt;

==Background==

===History===
When the Animal Rights Militia first emerged in the United Kingdom their focus was on illegal direct action. Utilizing tactics such as the destruction of property, intimidation, and including the use of violence, the ARM have sent letter bombs, placed incendiary devices under cars and in buildings, contaminated food products, sent death threats, and desecrated a grave.

The name was not heard of for eight years after a series of actions in England from 1982 to 1986. Philosopher [[Peter Singer]] wrote in 1986 that the ARM may not really exist.&lt;ref name="ALM"&gt;

The damage caused by fires averaged £2 million in each location.&lt;ref name=Man499&gt;[[Keith Mann|Mann, Keith]]. ''From Dusk 'til Dawn: An insider's view of the growth of the Animal Liberation Movement''. Puppy Pincher Press, 2007, p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt; ARM activists continue to report actions in European countries, North America and Australia. Similar to the ALF, activists send anonymous claims of responsibility to ''[[Bite Back Magazine]]'',  a website supportive of the animal liberation movement and its prisoners.

===Structure===
The ARM formed the same leaderless-resistance model as the Animal Liberation Front.&lt;ref name=armcanada&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qR4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MlwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4508,2703908&amp;dq=animal-rights-militia Food bar pulled from shelves], ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'', January 4th 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; A cell may consist of just one person. The existence of activists calling themselves the Animal Rights Militia or [[Justice Department (animal rights)|Justice Department]] reflects a struggle within the Animal Liberation Front and the [[animal rights movement]] in general, between those who believe violence is justified, and those who insist the movement should reject it in favor of [[non-violent resistance]].&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;[[Ronnie Lee|Lee, Ronnie]]. [http://www.nocompromise.org/issues/23controversial.html Controversial Actions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212062932/http://www.nocompromise.org/issues/23controversial.html |date=2008-02-12 }}, ''[[No Compromise (magazine)]]'', issue #23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
Philosopher [[Steven Best]] has coined the term "extensional self-defense" to describe actions carried out in defense of animals by human beings acting as proxy agents.&lt;ref name=sb1&gt;[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]]. [http://www.drstevebest.com/Essays/GapsInLogic.htm "Gaps in Logic, Lapses in Politics: Rights and Abolitionism in Joan Dunayer's Speciesism"], ''drstevebest.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that, in carrying out acts of extensional self-defense, activists have the moral right to engage in acts of sabotage or even violence.&lt;ref name="sb1"/&gt; Extensional self-defense is justified, he writes, because animals are "so vulnerable and oppressed they cannot fight back to attack or kill their oppressors." He argues that the principle of extensional self-defense mirrors the penal code statutes known as the "[[necessity defense]]," which can be invoked when a defendant believes that the illegal act was necessary to avoid imminent and great harm.&lt;ref name=alpo&gt;[[Steven Best|Best, Steven]]. [http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org/Writings_Speeches/whos_afraid_of_jerry_vlasak.html "Who's Afraid of Jerry Vlasak?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421181812/http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org/Writings_Speeches/whos_afraid_of_jerry_vlasak.html |date=2008-04-21 }}, ''Animal Liberation Press Office''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In testimony to the Senate in 2005, Jerry Vlasak stated that he regarded violence against [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]] as an example of extensional self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John J. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_12_58/ai_n16740562/pg_1 "In the name of the animals: America faces a new kind of terrorism"], ''National Review'', 3 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions==

'''History'''

The Animal Rights Militia is believed to be a splinter group of the Animal Liberation Front. The reason ARM was created is that the ALF has a strict no-violence policy towards any living being, whereas this newfound group can use all means necessary to free animals from places of abuse and torture. Since they have been set up, the ARM has caused millions of pounds (and dollars) worth of damage to animal labs, universities and slaughterhouses. Also, ARM have cost companies such as Mars and Lucozade millions of pounds because of false contamination claims, as described later.

Some ministers claim ARM does not actually exist, and is actually a part of the ALF, used to distract the police and intelligence services from itself.

===1980s===
;1982
The first action became known on November 30 when five letter bombs were sent to [[Margaret Thatcher]], then British Prime Minister,&lt;ref name="ALM"/&gt; the Home Office minister responsible for animal legislation, as well as the leaders of Britain's three main opposition parties, signed by the Animal Rights Militia.&lt;ref name=first&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c-UNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nG0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5678,834492&amp;dq=animal-rights-militia Britain plans to tighten mail security], ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', 2 December 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann536&gt;[[Keith Mann|Mann, Keith]]. ''From Dusk 'til Dawn: An insider's view of the growth of the Animal Liberation Movement''. Puppy Pincher Press, 2007, p. 497.&lt;/ref&gt; The office manager to Thatcher suffered superficial burns on his hands and face when opening the package that burst into flames.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923139,00.html Bare Facts], ''Time'', 13 December 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reported that the 8-by-4&amp;nbsp;inch package filled with [[gunpowder]] that exploded evaded Post Office scanners, causing a tightening in mail security at 10 Downing Street. [[Scotland Yard]] led the investigation stating, "We are now connecting all five letter-bombs with the same organisation."&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

;1983
In February, four months after the attack against politicians, five more letter bombs were sent to different addresses in London, England, claimed again by the ARM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB35B676676E7B9&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Bombs linked to seal hunt protest|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|date=1983-02-16|access-date=2016-09-26|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an action apparently to protest the annual [[seal hunt]] in Newfoundland, Canada, the explosives were delivered to the Canadian High Commission, the then Agriculture minister, a surgeon and a furrier. This time, however, as the padded envelopes were defused, there were no injuries. {{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

;1985
In September, [[incendiary device]]s were placed under the cars of two animal researchers for BIBRA (British Industrial Biological Research Association) in South London, which completely wrecked both vehicles.&lt;ref name="Mann536"/&gt; ARM then claimed the contamination of [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]] products, claiming it was because of their [[animal experiment]]s relating to tooth decay which ARM claimed the company had no intention of ending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animalliberationfront.com/ALFront/Actions-UK/alfarm.htm ARM Militia], [[Animal Liberation Front]] Website.&lt;/ref&gt; ARM then claimed the contamination was a hoax and they had not carried out the action. But claimed that it had caused huge financial damage which was the intention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animalliberationfront.com/ALFront/Actions-UK/alfarm.htm ARM Militia], Animal Liberation website.
*[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/30/animalwelfare.world Animal rights group 'has contaminated Savlon'], ''The Guardian'', 30 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

;1986
Three months later in January, ARM claimed responsibility for placing incendiary devices under cars of four individuals involved in [[animal research]] at [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]]. The explosives were placed in Harrogate, South London, Staffordshire and Sussex, timed to explode an hour apart from each other. This time, also the last time according to the cell, the bomb disposal team were alerted, who deactivated the devices that were confirmed to be live. The next attack the ARM claimed was intended to kill Dr Andor Sebesteny, an animal researcher for the [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]] (ICRF). However he noticed the device that was attached under his car which saved his life, since no warning had been given.&lt;ref name="Mann536"/&gt; ARM also claimed responsibility for sending more letter bombs to individuals involved in vivisection.&lt;ref name="TFF"&gt;

;1987
On 1 September, at San Jose Valley Veal &amp; Beef, Santa Clara, California, the ARM claims responsibility for an arson which cost $10,000 in damages.&lt;ref name=splc&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=29 Eco-Violence: The Record], Southern Poverty Law Center, Fall 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
;1992
On 4 January 1992, the ''Edmonton Journal'' reported of an ARM action claimed by a letter and sent to the journal, as well as the Canadian Press. The cell said they injected 87 of the month-old food bar, the Canadian Cold Buster, with liquid oven cleaner, resulting in the product being pulled from shelves in Alberta, Canada. The ARM claimed in the letter, along with two bars,&lt;ref name=cbscanada&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/bioweapons/threat.html Bio-chem threat], CBS, February 18th 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; the contamination was due to the slaughter of thousands of rats, injected with various drugs, frozen and starved, "...because of the decade-and-a-half-long history of animal suffering that is this candy's history." The police at the time advised against consuming the food bar, unsure whether the action was genuine.&lt;ref name="armcanada"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PBPB&amp;p_theme=pbpb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF8513801CBA7D&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM 'Cold Buster' Chocolate Bars Pulled After Tainting Threat], ''The Palm Beach Post'', January 4th 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The candy bars sent to the media were later confirmed to have been injected with [[saline solution]] (harmless sterilised table salt), proving to be a hoax.&lt;ref name="cbscanada"/&gt;

;1994
On 6 July, it was reported widely that the Cambridge store of [[Boots Group|Boots]] and also the [[Edinburgh Woolen Mill]] in the centre of the city had caught on fire. The Boots branch burnt for four hours completely destroying the building and the wool clothing store was badly damaged with the entire stock ruined. Two more devices were then found, both leather shops, one of which was in the pocket of a [[sheepskin]] coat. The ARM claimed all four devices, causing Cambridge city centre to be cordoned off whilst officers searched for two more devices that the cell claimed would explode the following day at 12pm. After an extensive search, it was concluded that the additional two devices claimed were a hoax, with no further devices exploding the following day. A month later, another leather shop was destroyed and the same wool mill suffered minor damage after devices went off, with two more recovered in leather shops and one in a [[fur]] shop.&lt;ref name=Man498&gt;[[Keith Mann|Mann, Keith]].

ARM then set fire to shops on the Isle of Wight two week later, causing £3 million worth of damage.&lt;ref name="TFF" /&gt; Initially an incendiary device had been found in a fishing tackle shop as a customer tried on a jacket, accidentally discovering the cigarette packet explosive. The police were called and seized the jacket for forensic tests, alerting all other fishing tackle shops in the island.&lt;ref name="Man498"/&gt; However four further devices had been planted in Ryde and Newport, with the next one found in [[Halfords]], a subsidiary of Boots, that was detonated in a controlled explosion. The three remaining devices then ignited in the early hours of the morning, setting ablaze two leather shops and an [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]] (ICRF) shop, as a hundred firefighters attended to the fires.&lt;ref name="Man499"/&gt;

Throughout the rest of the year extensive damage continued to occur elsewhere, most notably in the other end of the country in [[North Yorkshire]] by the ARM. Boots in Harrogate and Fads, another Boots subsidiary, were set on fire, followed by another ICRF shop and a [[bloodsports]] shop. In York, a newly refurbished Boots and Fads were again targeted by arsonists, causing a less but still severe damage to the properties.&lt;ref name="Man499"/&gt;

On Christmas Day, the ARM then claimed in writing to two of Vancouver's biggest chains, Save-On Foods and Canada Safeway, that they had injected rat poison into turkeys in supermarkets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AK&amp;s_site=ohio&amp;p_multi=AK&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB631384EF9FCDA&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Turkeys out of stores after poison threat], ''Ohio.com'', 25 December 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of contamination was not found.&lt;ref name="cbscanada"/&gt;

ARM further came to widespread public attention in the UK in December, during one of Horne's hunger strikes, which lasted 68 days. It was carried out in protest at the British government's refusal to order a commission of inquiry into animal testing, and ARM threatened to assassinate a number of individuals involved in vivisection should Horne die. Those threatened were [[Colin Blakemore]], later chief executive of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]; Clive Page of King's College London, a professor of [[Lung|pulmonary]] [[pharmacology]] and chair of the animal science group of the British Biosciences Federation; Mark Matfield of the [[Research Defence Society]]; and Christopher Brown, the owner of [[Hillgrove Farm]] in Oxfordshire, who was breeding kittens for laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/230995.stm "Death-threat vivisector calls for industry support"], BBC News, 8 December 1998.

ARM claimed responsibility for removing, in October, from a grave the body of Gladys Hammond, the mother-in-law of Christopher Hall, part-owner of [[Darley Oaks Farm]], which bred guinea pigs for Huntingdon Life Sciences, and which had been the target of the animal rights campaign [[Save the Newchurch Guinea Pigs]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph124"&gt;

Following the announced in August that the Hall family were no longer breeding guinea pigs for medical research, the ARM sent letters to the homes of 17 company directors associated with HLS. Most of the companies targeted were building contractors based in Peterborough, Huntingdon, and Harrogate. A letter from the ARM activists said:

Four people were convicted on 11 May for their involvement in what ''The Guardian'' called "a six-year hate campaign" that included letter bombs, vandalism and grave robbing. The judge described the group's actions as "subjecting wholly innocent citizens to a campaign of terror." The campaign included hate mail signed Animal Rights Militia (ARM) and Animal Liberation Front (ALF).

A spokesperson for POM replied: "If it is a hoax, it is a form of blackmail. If actual contamination has taken place, with the intention of injuring innocent people, it is an act of terrorism. Either way, the Animal Rights Militia is trying to scare and intimidate innocent people. That is criminal behaviour."

===2010-2012===
The ARM has claimed attacks in Sweden, mainly against vivisection personnel and fur farm owners. The actions involved bomb threats and vandalism against the target's private homes. There was a wave of ARM-claimed attacks in Sweden during 2011-2012 after the arrest of a young animal rights activist who was sentenced to prison in 2011.

==Convictions==

Paul Scare was sentenced to one year in prison for sending razor blades to the people who he had targeted.&lt;ref name="Man498"/&gt;
;1994
[[Barry Horne]] was subsequently jailed for eighteen years for the arson attacks. The prosecution successfully argued that the devices used in Bristol and the Isle of Wight were so similar that Horne should be regarded as responsible for both, despite only pleading guilty to an attempted arson in Bristol.&lt;ref name=Man542&gt;[[Keith Mann|Mann, Keith]].

Niel Hanson was sentenced to three years for sending the hoax device to [[GlaxoSmithKline]] public relations officer in Hertfordshire. He was initially charged with conspiracy to murder, which was then revised to a lesser crime and he was re-sentenced to serve three years, for the device that was a bag of cat litter sent via taxi.&lt;ref name="Man498"/&gt;

'''[[Animal testing]] regulations''' are [[laws]] or [[guideline]]s that permit and control the use of non-human animals for [[scientific experimentation]]. They vary greatly around the world, but most governments aim to control the number of times individual animals may be used; the overall numbers used; and the degree of pain that may be inflicted without [[anesthetic]].

==Europe==
Experiments on [[vertebrate]] animals in the [[European Union]] are since January 1, 2013.&lt;ref name="EUDirective2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/home_en.htm|title=Animals used for scientific purposes|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UKGuideOnEUDirective"&gt;[http://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/page/download_document/?document_id=53 The revised European Directive 2010/63/EU: a guide for UK institutions]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825130929/http://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/page/download_document/?document_id=53 |date=August 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subject to ''[[Alternatives to animal testing#EU Directive 2010/63/EU|Directive 2010/63/EU]] on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes'', which was finalized in November 2010 and updated and replaced the ''Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of Animals used for Experimental and other scientific purposes'', adopted in 1986.&lt;ref name="EUDirective"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/revision_en.htm "Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of Animals used for Experimental and other scientific purposes"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805034159/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/revision_en.htm |date=August 5, 2009 }} European Commission, 1986.

With a 2004 amendment to the [[Cosmetics Directive]], the animal testing for cosmetic products is forbidden in the EU. Also animal testing for cosmetic ingredients is prohibited since March 2009. The amendment also prohibited, since 11 March 2009, to market cosmetic products containing ingredients which have been tested on animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-210_en.htm|title = Full EU ban on animal testing for cosmetics enters into force|date = March 11, 2013|accessdate = May 20, 2015|website = European Commission|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment does not prohibit companies to use animal testing to fulfill regulatory requirements in other countries.

===France===
In France, legislation (principally the decree of October 19, 1980) requires an institutional and project license before testing on vertebrates is carried out. An institution must submit details of their facilities and the reason for the experiments, after which a five-year license may be granted following an inspection of the premises. The project licensee must be trained and educated to an appropriate level. Personal licenses are not required for individuals working under the supervision of a project license holder.&lt;ref name="HoL1"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15004.htm#a9 Introduction: Regulation in France], Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures Report, 16 July 2002.

A licence should not be granted if there is a "reasonably practicable method not entailing the use of protected animals" (Section 5(5) (a)). The experiments must use "the minimum number of animals, involve animals with the lowest degree of [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] sensitivity, cause the least pain, suffering, distress, or lasting harm, and [be the] most likely to produce satisfactory results" (Section 5(5) (b)).&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15004.htm#a4 Select Committee on Animals In Scientific Procedures – Report] Chapter 1: Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 2002 House of Lords select committee inquiry into animal testing in the UK, witnesses stated that the UK has the tightest regulatory system in the world, and is the only country to require a cost-benefit assessment of every licence application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15004.htm#a4|title=House of Lords - Animals In Scientific Procedures - Report|work=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 29 qualified inspectors covering 230 establishments, which are visited on average 11–12 times a year in both announced and unannounced inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceandresearch.homeoffice.gov.uk/animal-research/publications/publications/reports-and-reviews/annual-report |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223112057/http://scienceandresearch.homeoffice.gov.uk/animal-research/publications/publications/reports-and-reviews/annual-report |archivedate=2007-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the transposition of [[Alternatives to animal testing#EU Directive 2010/63/EU|Directive 2010/63/EU]], changes were made to the way research is reviewed and approved in the UK. All licensed establishments must have an Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Different systems of ethical review - In the UK|url=}}co&lt;/ref&gt; (commonly referred to as AWERBs) which considers and monitors project applications for the site. The assessment of severity has also changed under the amendments to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986). Working examples of severity bands are provided by European Commission Expert Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examples to illustrate the process of severity classification, day-to-day assessment and actual severity assessment|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/pdf/examples.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment of severity must also be conducted retrospectively, which results in severity being assigned on the basis of the ''actual'' suffering experienced by the animals, rather than what is presumed during study design. This in turn leads to more accurate prospective assignment of severity bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Competent Authorities for the implementation of Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes Working document on a severity assessment framework|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/pdf/Endorsed_Severity_Assessment.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The German Animal Welfare Act, 1972, is designed to enforce the utilitarian principle that there must be good reason for one to cause an animal harm and identifies that it is the responsibility of human beings to protect the lives and well-being of their fellow creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animallaw.info/nonus/statutes/stdeawa1998.htm|title=Germany - Cruelty - German Animal Welfare Act - Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center|work=animallaw.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Animal Welfare Act is supplemented by the Animal Protection Laboratory Animal Regulations, 2013, and the European Directive 2010/63/EU. All animal research facilities must be inspected at least every three years, with facilities conducting primate research being inspected at least once per year.&lt;ref name=GermanRegs&gt;[https://speakingofresearch.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/briefing-on-animal-research-in-germany-2017.pdf Briefing Notes on Animal Research in Germany 2017], Speaking of Research, retrieved 20 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==

===Japan===

Animal Experimentation in Japan is regulated by several documents - the Law for the Humane Treatment and Management of Animals, 2005, The Standards Relating to the Care and Management, and Alleviation of Pain and Distress of Experimental Animals, 2006, and guidelines by 
various ministries and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kurosawa|first1=Tsutomu Miki|title=Japanese regulation of laboratory animal care with 3Rs|journal=Alternatives to Animal Testing and Experimentation|date=2007|volume=14|issue=Special Issue|pages=317–321|url=http://altweb.jhsph.edu/wc6/paper317.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law states that causing distress to animals is not allowed without due cause (Article 2), and that when conducting animal experiments, methods that reduce the pain and distress of the animals as much as possible shall be used.  It also states that consideration shall be given as to the appropriate use of animals, for example by reducing the number of animals used when possible (Article 41).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Act on Welfare and Management of Animals (up to the revisions of Act No.68 of 2005(English Translation))|url=http://www.alive-net.net/english/en-law/index.html|website=ALIVE - All Life in a Viable Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Standards state that usage of animals for scientific purpose is necessary.  They include regulations for the refinement of experiments, in order to reduce the pain and distress of the experimental animals, and consideration for replacing animal experiments with alternatives or reducing the number of animals used.

MEXT (The  Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) and MHLW (The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare) established the guidelines named "Basic policies on animal experimentation" as quasi-regulations on June 1, 2006.  The SCJ (Science Council 
of Japan) formulated more detailed guidelines, also in 2006, to be used when institutions formate their local regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kagiyama|last2=Ikeda|last3=Nomura|first1=Naoko|first2=Takuya|first3=Tatsuji|title=Japanese guidelines and regulations for scientific and ethical animal experimentation|journal=In Vivo: Models of Inflammation|date=2006|volume=1|pages=187–191|url=http://www.aaalac.org/intlRefs/IntRegs/Japan/Private%20site/Japanese_Guidelines.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCJ's guidelines state that the director of each research institution bears the responsibility for animal experiments conducted at their facilities, that animal experiments are indispensable, and that each institution should formulate voluntary in-house regulations for proper scientific conduct of animal experiments based on the guidelines.  As well, they state that each institution should form an in-house review committee in order to inspect the experiments at that institution, from the standpoint of scientific rationale, with consideration to the Law and Standards mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Science Council of Japan|title=Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments|date=June 1, 2006|url=http://www.scj.go.jp/ja/info/kohyo/pdf/kohyo-20-k16-2e.pdf|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ALIVE Foundation conducted a survey of Japanese universities and research facilities in 2011, and concluded that:

"There appears to be little consciousness about the use of animals in experiments. Although there is an official guideline that should be followed, national universities are not complying with the guideline (in particular, in choosing particular kinds of animal, self-assessment and care/management of animals)." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Checking Animal Experiment Information Disclosure on the Internet|url=http://www.alive-net.net/english/en-law/disclosure.htm|website=ALIVE - All Life in Viable Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the IACUC reviews and approves each animal use protocol, which is a written description the researchers submit describing all procedures to be done with laboratory animals. Researchers must consult with a veterinarian for each procedure that may cause more than momentary pain or distress to the animals. In addition a written justification for these procedures, as well as documentation of a search for alternatives to these procedures, must be included with the protocol. The IACUC must review and approve these protocols at least annually. The IACUC also inspects all the animal facilities, including satellite facilities, every 6 months. As a part of this semi-annual inspection the committee also reviews the entire animal care and use program, and submits a "semi-annual report" to the Institutional Official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=931bb395059c14cf19fc4c51d7902b31&amp;node=9:1.0.1.1.2.3.1.2&amp;rgn=div8|title=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations|work=ecfr.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guide (enforced by OLAW) also has requirements for IACUC responsibilities and program reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12910&amp;page=11|title=Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals: Eighth Edition|work=nap.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animal care and use in research in the United States''' are largely controlled by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.

The following information is based on IACUC activity in the United States over 15 years ago. In addition, the purpose of an IACUC is not to provide "consistent" oversight across studies or institutions. Each institution has its own culture, priorities, and interpretations. 
A study conducted in 2001 by Psychology Professor [[Scott Plous]] of [[Wesleyan University]] that evaluated the reliability of IACUCs found little consistency between decisions made by IACUCs at different institutions. A Wesleyan University press release summarized part of the findings:

{{quotation|The investigation, which took three years to complete, compared judgments made by 50 randomly selected animal care and use committees drawn from U.S. colleges and universities. To assess the consistency of approval decisions, 150 recent research proposals from these institutions were each independently evaluated by two different animal care and use committees.

The results showed that approval decisions were statistically unrelated. In most cases, proposals that were disapproved by one committee were approved by the second committee.

The study also explored whether reviews were more reliable when the experiment involved certain types of animals or procedures. For example, reliability was assessed for proposals that involved dogs, cats, and primates, or for experiments involving drugs, surgery, animal pain, or death. Even in these cases, independent reviews did not agree beyond chance levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialpsychology.org/articles/scipress.htm] Study Finds Inconsistency in Animal Research Reviews. Wesleyan University; July 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response to the Plous study, a rebuttal letter to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' written by animal researchers, animal care staff, and members of professional research societies stated:

{{quotation|That the masked protocols would be rated more negatively was predictable for the following reasons. First, IACUCs rely on knowing the experience of the investigators and staff, information that was not included for the unofficial IACUCs. Not surprisingly, most of the negative shifts (84 of 118) were to categories calling for more information. Second, withholding approval had no practical consequence. Third, participants might have felt scrutinized by researchers with an "animal rights" agenda, and erred on the side of deferral or rejection. Fourth, navigating another institution's forms can be difficult. And fifth, IACUCs unfamiliar with particular species or procedures are less likely to understand a protocol. These factors make it almost impossible to compare the actions of the original and unofficial IACUCs and thus call into question the major premises and conclusions of this study.&lt;ref&gt;Science 30 November 2001: Vol. 294. no. 5548, pp. 1831–1832 {{doi|10.1126/science.294.5548.1831b}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Institutions are also subject to unannounced annual inspections from USDA APHIS Veterinarian inspectors. There are about 70 inspectors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_welfare/content/printable_version/fs_awinspect.pdf Compliance Inspections] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927123550/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_welfare/content/printable_version/fs_awinspect.pdf |date=September 27, 2007 }} Animal Welfare – USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Accessed 06 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; monitoring around 1100 research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ac/publications.html "See Facility Lists"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222121931/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ac/publications.html |date=December 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inspectors also conduct pre-licensing checks for sites that do not engage in animal research or transportation, of which more than 4000 exist (e.g. dog kennels).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/fsheet_faq_notice/faq_awusda.html "APHIS AWA FAQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206224132/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/fsheet_faq_notice/faq_awusda.html |date=December 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

 
Another regulatory instrument is the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm|title=Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an office within the US National Institutes of Health. OLAW oversees all animal studies funded by the Public Health Service (including NIH).  The Health Research Extension Act of 1985 directed the NIH to write the [[Public Health Service]] (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. This Policy applies to any individual scientist or institution in receipt of federal funds and requires each institution to have an IACUC, among other stipulations. OLAW enforces the recommendations in the ''Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals''[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12910] published by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research,[http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarhome/] which covers all vertebrate species, including rodents, birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles  [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12910] This means that IACUCs oversee the use of all [[vertebrate]] species in research at facilities receiving federal funds, even if the species are not covered by the AWA. OLAW does not carry out scheduled inspections, but requires that "As a condition of receipt of PHS support for research involving laboratory animals, awardee institutions must provide a written Animal Welfare Assurance of Compliance (Assurance) to OLAW describing the means they will employ to comply with the PHS Policy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/ComplianceOversightProc.pdf] Compliance Oversight Procedures (PDF) OLAW. NIH. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; OLAW conducts inspections only when there is a suspected or alleged violation that cannot be resolved through written correspondence.

==Canada==
The [[Canadian Council on Animal Care]] (CCAC) is set up to act in the interests of the people of Canada to ensure through programs of education, assessment and guidelines development that the use of animals, where necessary, for research, teaching and testing employs optimal physical and psychological care according to acceptable scientific standards, and to promote an increased level of knowledge, awareness and sensitivity to relevant ethical principles. At the inaugural meeting on January 30, 1968, the CCAC adopted the following statement of objective: "to develop guiding principles for the care of experimental animals in Canada, and to work for their effective application".&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccac.ca/en_/education/niaut/stream/cs-guidelines |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902075036/http://ccac.ca/en_/education/niaut/stream/cs-guidelines |archivedate=2012-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government does not have jurisdiction to pass laws that involve experiments on animals. The provinces have jurisdiction concerning that area. The federal government, however, is involved in three areas: the criminal law power, the health power, and the spending power.

'''The Criminal Code of Canada'''
Section 446 and 447 of the Criminal Code protect animals from cruelty, abuse and neglect. This section of the Criminal Code has been under review for several years.

'''The Health of Animals Act'''
The Health of Animals Act (1990) and its regulations are aimed primarily at protecting Canadian livestock from a variety of infectious diseases that would threaten both the health of the animals and people, and Canadian trade in livestock with other countries. This act is used both to deal with named disease outbreaks in Canada, and to prevent the entry of unacceptable diseases that do not exist in Canada.

'''The Spending Power'''
The other mechanism through which the federal government has lent its support to the humane treatment of animals is not strictly speaking legislative in nature, but in many respects it is one of the most powerful instruments available to the federal government for setting national standards. The federal government's power to provide for grants subject to conditions imposed on the recipients, be they provincial governments or individual or corporate recipients, may take a variety of different forms. One form is that of the conditional federal grant or contract. This manifestation of the federal power is what currently underpins the imposition of CCAC standards on facilities receiving funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council. Where the government itself awards a contract on an academic or non-academic institution, clause A9015C of Public Works Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions Manual imposes conditions related to the care and use of experimental animals in public works and government services.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt;

All of the provinces in Canada have created and passed laws that pertain to animal welfare, but only certain provinces have made their own laws. These provinces are Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island.

===Alberta===
In 2006, the Alberta Animal Protection Act was revised and declared. Previously in Alberta, only academic institutions were subject to provincial regulations referencing CCAC standards, as these standards were referenced exclusively in the Alberta Universities Act. In 2005, the Universities Act and two other laws were examined by the Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development Ministry (AAFRD), in hopes of combining them and update their content. Article 2(1) of the Animal Protection Regulations was revised by the CCAC and AAFRD and now states that "a person who owns or has custody, care or control of an animal for research activities must comply with the following Canadian Council on Animal Care documents", and lists all 22 CCAC standards, including the CCAC Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals and the various guidelines and policies published by the CCAC.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt;

===Prince Edward Island===
In Prince Edward Island, the ''Animal Protection Regulations'' made under the ''Animal Health and Protection Act'' state that the rules controlling the care of animals used for medical or scientific research can be found in Volumes 1 and 2 of the ''Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals'' published by the CCAC.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt;

===Manitoba===
In the province of Manitoba, according to the Animal Care Act, it is not allowed for a person to cause suffering to an animal. The use of animals for research and teaching is acceptable as long as it follows the rules set out in the Act. All institutions that use animals for research and teaching purposes have to submit to obey the system put in place by the CCAC. Failing to do so, any harm done to an animal in a research or teaching program will be regarded as an offense under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/a084e.php|title=The Animal Care Act|work=gov.mb.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ontario===
All of the research facilities in Ontario must be registered and licensed based on the legislation Animals for Research Act. Among the provisions of the Animals for Research Act, one should note the duty to establish an animal care committee, the responsibilities and powers of which are similar to those required under the CCAC system, and the requirement for any operator of a research facility to submit to the person designated by the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs a report respecting the animals used in the research facility for research.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt;  Regulation 24 governs the housing and care of the animals. Regulation 25 controls the conditions for transportation of the animals that are used or going to be used by a research facility.

==Australia==
In Australia, Animal Ethics Committees (AECs) determine whether the use of an animal is valid or not. AECs must follow the Code in order to ensure the wellbeing of the animals used for research. The Code emphasizes the responsibilities of investigators, teachers and institutions using animals to:
*ensure that the use of animals is justified, taking into consideration the scientific or educational benefits and the potential effects on the welfare of the animals;
*ensure that the welfare of animals is always considered;
*promote the development and use of techniques that replace the use of animals in
scientific and teaching activities;
*minimise the number of animals used in projects; and
*refine methods and procedures to avoid pain or distress in animals used in scientific and teaching activities.&lt;ref name=AustralianGov&gt;[http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/ea16.pdf] "Australian Government". 7th Edition, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific and teaching activities using animals may be performed only when they are essential:
*to obtain and establish significant information relevant to the understanding of humans and/or animals;
*for the maintenance and improvement of human and/or animal health and welfare;
*for the improvement of animal management or production;
*to obtain and establish significant information relevant to the understanding, maintenance or improvement of the natural environment; or
*for the achievement of educational objectives.&lt;ref name=AustralianGov /&gt;

Researchers can only conduct their studies once it has approved the validity of the use of the animals and that there is more educational or scientific gain that outweighs the possible effects on the welfare of the animals. The researchers must submit a written proposal to an AEC stating what is to be accomplished, a defense for the study, and the ethical and wellbeing of the animals used reflecting the 3Rs.

==New Zealand==
{{Main article|Regulation of Animal Research in New Zealand}}
New Zealand's Animal Welfare Act 1999&lt;ref name=AWA&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry for Primary Industries|title=Guide to the Animal Welfare Act 1999|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/legislation/animal-welfare-act/guide/index.htm|publisher=MPI|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  requires owners and people in charge of animals to ensure the physical, health and behavioural needs of animals are met, and that pain and distress are alleviated. In New Zealand, as in many countries, laboratory animals (mainly rodents) and farm animals (mainly cattle and sheep) are used in research, testing and teaching – commonly referred to as RTT. Animal use in RTT is strictly controlled under the Animal Welfare Act 1999&lt;ref name=AWA /&gt;  and organisations using animals must follow an approved code of ethical conduct. This sets out the policies and procedures that need to be adopted and followed by the organisation and its animal ethics committee.

Every project must be approved and monitored by an animal ethics committee. These committees must have three external members:

* a nominee of an approved animal welfare organisation (such as the SPCA),&lt;ref name=RNZSPCA&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|title=SPCA New Zealand|url=http://rnzspca.org.nz/|publisher=SPCA|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a nominee of the New Zealand Veterinary Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=New Zealand Veterinary Association|title=Home page|url=http://www.nzva.org.nz/|publisher=NZVA|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and,
* a lay person to represent the public interest (and nominated by a local government body).

Code holders and their animal ethics committees are independently reviewed (by MPI accredited reviewers) at least once every five years. All code holders have to submit annual animal use statistics on the number of animals used in research, testing or teaching, and its impact on them, from little or none to severe.

The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry for Primary Industries|title=Animal Welfare|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/animal-welfare/|publisher=Ministry for Primary Industries|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  administers the Act and leads animal welfare policy and practice in New Zealand. The National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee (NAEAC)&lt;ref name=NAEAC&gt;{{cite web|last=National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee|title=NAEAC|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/regs/animal-welfare/nz/naeac|publisher=MPI|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was established under the Animal Welfare Act&lt;ref name=AWA /&gt; to provide independent advice to the Minister for Primary Industries about:

* ethical and animal welfare issues relating to the use of animals in research, testing and teaching
* recommendations on the restrictions of use of non-human hominids
* advice to Animal Ethics Committees
* the development and review of codes of ethical conduct

==Brazil==
The federal law for the scientific use of animals was passed in 2008. The law established the National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation (CONCEA) and demanded that institutions create an ethics committee on the use of animals.

In 2009, Decree 6899/2009 defined CONCEA as the governing and advisory body, under the Ministry of Science and Technology, to authorize accreditation to registered institutions and to license those institutions to use animals in research. The same decree also states that an electronic database be developed to allow breeding and research facilities to register in order to apply for CONCEA accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dels-old.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/52_1/PDFs/v5201e-Filipecki.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816183043/http://dels-old.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/52_1/PDFs/v5201e-Filipecki.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil also reinforces the 3Rs.

'''''Apostolicam Actuositatem''''' is the [[Second Vatican Council|Second Vatican Council's]] '''Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity'''.  It was approved by a vote of 2,340 to 2 of bishops assembled at the Council, and promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 18 November 1965.  The title is [[Latin]] for "Apostolic Activity", which is from the first line of the decree, as is customary with significant [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] documents.

''Apostolicam Actuositatem'' acknowledges the central importance of the laity in the mission of the Catholic Church. The purpose of this document was to encourage and guide lay people in their Christian service. In this decree the Council sought to describe the nature, character, and diversity of the [[lay apostolate]], to state its basic principles, and to give pastoral directives for its more effective exercise. The specific objectives of lay ministry are: evangelization and sanctification, renewal of the temporal order, and charitable works and social aid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecatholicconnection.org/?p=1417 Rachal, Dianne. "Decree on the Apostolate of Lay People", ''Catholic Connection'', Diocese of Shreveport, 3 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;  The decree quotes Colossians 3:17: "Whatever you do in word or work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God the Father through Him".

== Background ==
''Apostolicam Actuositatem'' follows upon ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', the "Dogmatic Constitution on the Church", of 21 November 1964, which in Chapter IV, discusses the laity, by which they mean all the faithful except those in Holy Orders or religious institutes. "They live in the ordinary circumstances of family and social life, from which the very web of their existence is woven.  ...led by the spirit of the Gospel they may work for the sanctification of the world from within as a leaven. In this way they may make Christ known to others, especially by the testimony of a life resplendent in faith, hope and charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html Second Vatican Council.

The [[Pontifical Council for the Laity]] had its foundation in Vatican II's Apostolicam Actuositatem - Decree on the Lay Apostolate §26. The council was created in January 1967 by [[Pope Paul VI|Pope Paul VI's]] [[motu proprio]] Catholicam Christi Ecclesiam. In December 1976, the council was included as a permanent fixture of the [[Roman Curia]]. In September 2016, its functions were shifted to the new [[Dicastery for the Laity, Family and Life]].

Content includes:

* The apostolate of the laity derives from their Christian vocation and the Church can never be without it. (1)
* The laity share in the priestly, prophetic, and royal office of Christ and therefore have their own share in the mission of the whole people of God. (2)
* The laity are called by God to exercise their apostolate in the world like leaven, with the ardor of the spirit of Christ. (2)
* One engages in the apostolate through the faith, hope, and charity which the Holy Spirit diffuses in the hearts of all members of the Church. (3)
* This plan for the spiritual life of the laity should take its particular character from their married or family state or their single or widowed state, from their state of health, and from their professional and social activity. They should not cease to develop earnestly the qualities and talents bestowed on them in accord with these conditions of life, and they should make use of the gifts which they have received from the Holy Spirit. ... They should also hold in high esteem professional skill, family and civic spirit, and the virtues relating to social customs, namely, honesty, justice, sincerity, kindness, and courage, without which no true Christian life can exist. ... The perfect example of this type of spiritual and apostolic life is the most Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Apostles, who while leading the life common to all here on earth, one filled with family concerns and labors, was always intimately united with her Son ....{{sfn|Apostolicam Actuositatem, §4}} (4)
* The layman, being simultaneously a believer and a citizen, should be continuously led by a Christian conscience.{{sfn|Apostolicam Actuositatem, §5}} (5)
* "The apostolate of the Church and of all its members is primarily designed to manifest Christ's message by words and deeds and to communicate His grace to the world.{{sfn|Apostolicam Actuositatem, §6}} (6)
* Pity for the needy and the sick and works of charity and mutual aid intended to relieve human needs of every kind are held in highest honor by the Church. (8)
* The laity with the right apostolic attitude supply what is lacking to their brethren and refresh the spirit of pastors and of the rest of the faithful (1 Cor. 16:17–18) (9)
* The laity should not limit their cooperation to the parochial or diocesan boundaries but strive to extend it to interparochial, interdiocesan, national, and international fields. (10)
* The apostolate of married persons and families is of unique importance for the Church and civil society.(11)
* If youthful zeal is imbued with the spirit of Christ and is inspired by obedience and love for the Church, it can be expected to be very fruitful.(12)
* Children also have their own apostolic work to do. According to their ability they are true living witnesses of Christ among their companions.(13)
* Among the signs of our times, the irresistibly increasing sense of the solidarity of all peoples is especially noteworthy.(14)
* The laity can engage in their apostolic activity either as individuals or together as members of various groups or associations.(15)
* The individual apostolate, flowing generously in a truly Christian life (John 4:14), is the origin of the whole lay apostolate, even of the organized type, and it admits of no substitute. (16)
* The individual apostolate has a special field in areas where Catholics are few in number and widely dispersed. (17)
* The united and organized form of the apostolate needs to be strengthened. Only the pooling of resources is capable of fully achieving the aims of the modern apostolate and firmly protecting its interests.(18)
* Lay societies, such as Catholic Action, advance the Church's apostolic aim, that is, the evangelization and sanctification of men and the formation of a Christian conscience and can infuse the spirit of the Gospel into various communities and departments of life. (20)
* Cooperation among various projects of the apostolate must be suitably directed by the hierarchy.(23)
* No project may claim the name “Catholic” unless it has obtained the consent of the lawful Church authority. (24)
* A special secretariat, moreover, should be established at the Holy See for the service and promotion of the lay apostolate.(26) 
* The gospel requires cooperation of Catholics with other Christians. (27)
* The lay apostolate can attain its maximum effectiveness only through a diversified and thorough formation. (28)
* Training for the lay apostolate should start with the child's earliest education. Adolescents and young persons should be initiated into the apostolate and imbued with its spirit. This formation must be perfected throughout their whole life. (30)
* Various types of the apostolate demand also a specially suitable formation. In regard to the apostolate for evangelizing and sanctifying men, the laity must be specially formed. (31)
* The most holy council earnestly entreats all the laity in the Lord to answer gladly, nobly, and promptly the more urgent invitation of Christ in this hour and the impulse of the Holy Spirit. (33)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1723">{{Argentine economic crisis}}
The Argentine '''economic emergency law''' was sanctioned in 2002, during the presidency of [[Eduardo Duhalde]]. As a result of the [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|2001 economic crisis]], the law set a [[state of emergency]] on the national economy. The law allowed the president to do things that are usually set to the Congress, such as influence the exchange rate, turn debts in US dollars into debts in Argentine pesos, set the price of taxes and tariffs, renew contracts with the providers of public services, set the price of some products, and taxes on oils, among other things.&lt;ref name="termina"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/economia/gobierno-anuncio-final-ley-emergencia-economica_0_Sydj0DCmG.html|title= Se "termina" la Emergencia Económica tras 16 años de vigencia|trans-title= The economic emergency ends after 1 years|language= Spanish|author= |date= January 6, 2018|publisher= Clarin|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initially, the law was expected to be in force for two years. However, the governments of [[Néstor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] always asked the Congress to renew it for two more years. It was renewed for the last time in December 2015, nearing the end of the presidency of Cristina Kirchner. President [[Mauricio Macri]] did not ask for such renewal in December 2017, and so the law ceased to be in force in the first days of 2018, 16 years after its initial sanction.&lt;ref name="termina" /&gt;

'''Article 301''' is an article of the [[Turkish Penal Code]] making it illegal to insult Turkey, the Turkish nation, or Turkish government institutions. It took effect on June 1, 2005, and was introduced as part of a package of penal law reform in the process preceding the opening of negotiations for [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkish membership]] of the [[European Union]] (EU), in order to bring Turkey up to Union standards.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/turkey-new-penal-code-touches-raw-nerves/article-140266 Turkey's new penal code touches raw nerves]," ''EurActiv'' June 2, 2005, updated November 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leicht"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2006/feb2006/turk-f06.shtml

The original version of the article made it a crime to "insult Turkishness"; on April 30, 2008, the article was amended to change "Turkishness" into "the Turkish nation". Since this article became law, charges have been brought in more than 60 cases, some of which are high-profile.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;Lea, Richard.

# In cases where denigration of Turkishness is committed by a Turkish citizen in another country the punishment shall be increased by one third.
# Expressions of thought intended to criticize shall not constitute a crime.

===Precursor===
Before the current Turkish Penal Code took effect, article 159 of the Turkish Penal Code dated 1926 covered the same offense. Among the earliest uses of article 159 was in 1928, when a number of Jews were convicted of "denigrating Turkishness" in the wake of the [[Elza Niego affair]]. Their crime had been to protest the murder of a young Jewish girl by a middle-aged government official.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jta.org/1928/01/16/archive/new-trial-ordered-for-nine-constantinople-jews-once-acquitted&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 159 was amended a few times, including in 1961 and 2003, before finally being replaced by the current article 301 in 2005.

==High-profile cases==
[[Image:Orhan Pamuk3.jpg|right|thumb|Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk was brought to trial regarding statements about the [[Armenian Genocide]].]]
Article 301 has been used to bring charges against writer [[Orhan Pamuk]] for stating, in an interview with Swiss magazine ''[[Das Magazin]],'' a weekly supplement to a number of Swiss daily newspapers, including the ''[[Tages-Anzeiger]]'', that "Thirty thousand Kurds have been killed here, and a million Armenians. And almost nobody dares to mention that. So I do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Der meistgehasste Türke |work=[[Das Magazin]] |publisher=[[Tages Anzeiger]] |date=2005-02-05 |last=Peuwsen |first=Peer |url=http://sc.tagesanzeiger.ch/dyn/news/kultur/560264.html |language=German |quote=Man hat hier 30 000 Kurden umgebracht.

In February 2006 the trial opened against five journalists charged with insulting the judicial institutions of the State under Article 301, and also of aiming to prejudice a court case under Article 288 of the Turkish Penal Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifex.org/en/content/view/full/72146 "Writer Hrant Dink acquitted; trials against other journalists continue"]. [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange|IFEX]]. February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the five had criticized a court order to shut down a conference in [[Istanbul]] about the [[Ottoman Armenian casualties]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[First World War]]. (The conference was nevertheless eventually held after having been transferred from a state university to a private university.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mahoney.

[[Committee to Protect Journalists|CPJ]] March 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;) The charges carried a potential penalty of a prison term of up to 10 years. The court dropped the charges against four of them on April 11, 2006 when it was determined that the time allowed by the statute of limitation had been exceeded,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifex.org/en/content/view/full/74203 "Trials against writers, journalists and publishers continue under Article 301"]. [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange|IFEX]].

Another high-profile case to result from this legislation involved the writer and journalist [[Perihan Mağden]], who was prosecuted for penning an article originally published in the December 26, 2005 issue of ''Yeni Aktuel'', titled "Conscientious Objection is a Human Right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Perihan |last=Magden |title=Vicdani Red Bir İnsan Hakkıdır |work=bianet |date=2006-06-07 |url=http://www.bianet.org/bianet/kategori/kadin/80142/vicdani-red-bir-insan-hakkidir |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731013654/http://www.bianet.org/bianet/kategori/kadin/80142/vicdani-red-bir-insan-hakkidir |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-31 |language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish military filed a complaint against her in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pamuk|first=Orhan|title=A question of conscience|work=[[The Guardian]]|department=Books|date=2006-06-03|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1789061,00.html}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/jun/03/all and http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/jun/03/all show nothing so I'm inclined to believe the Guardian pulled the story...

In July 2006 the Istanbul public prosecutor's office prepared an indictment alleging that the statements in the book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|Manufacturing Consent]]'' by [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Edward S. Herman]] constituted a breach of the article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2006/07/04/son/sontur14.asp "Noam Chomsky'nin kitabına 'Türklüğü aşağılamak'tan dava"] ''[[Milliyet]]'' Online, July 4, 2006, accessed July 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher and editors of the Turkish translation, as well as the translator, were brought to trial accordingly, but acquitted in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6198021.stm Turks acquitted over Chomsky book], ''[[BBC News]]'', December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[Elif Şafak]] also faced charges of "insulting Turkishness" because of her latest novel, ''The Bastard of Istanbul.''&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The case was thrown out by the judge after a demand by the prosecutor for the case to be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/22/turkey.books "Judge throws out charges against Turkish novelist "], ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the well-known Armenian-Turkish journalist [[Hrant Dink]] was prosecuted under the Article 301 for insulting Turkishness, and received a six-month suspended sentence. He was subsequently assassinated by radical nationalists. Orhan Pamuk declared, "In a sense, we are all responsible for his death. However, at the very forefront of this responsibility are those who still defend article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code. Those who campaigned against him, those who portrayed this sibling of ours as an enemy of Turkey, those who painted him as a target, they are the most responsible in this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Orhan Pamuk: We are all responsible for Dink's death |url= http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/5817673.asp |work= [[Hürriyet]] |date= 2007-01-21 |accessdate= 2007-01-22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Arat Dink (Hrant Dink's son) and Serkis Seropyan were convicted to one-year suspended sentences under Article 301 for printing Dink's words that the killings of Armenians in 1915 was a genocide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7040171.stm Pair guilty of 'insulting Turkey'], ''[[BBC News]]'', October 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Rahîm Er]], a daily columnist of conservative democrat ''Turkiye'' daily newspaper was convicted under Article 301 for criticising the [[Court of Cassation (Turkey)|Court of Cassation]] of Turkey. Er was criticising the Court of Cassation due to the length of the trials, its heavy backlog, and the hidden resistance to the establishment of regional courts of appeals in Turkey. He was charged with insulting an institution of the Republic of Turkey by chief public prosecutor's office in [[Bakırköy]]. This prosecution was struck out by the dismissal of [[Mehmet Ali Şahin]], then the minister of justice.

==Other high-profile incidents==
In December 2005 [[Joost Lagendijk]], a member of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[GreenLeft]] party and the [[European Parliament]]'s [[Committee on Foreign Affairs (EU)|Committee on Foreign Affairs]], chairman of the [[European Union|EU]]-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, and a staunch supporter of Turkish EU membership, visited Turkey to attend the trial against Orhan Pamuk. In his speech he commented on the [[Şemdinli incident]] and criticized the [[Turkish military]] for seeking to maintain its political influence through the continuous guerrilla war with the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]].&lt;ref name="leicht"/&gt;
[[Greater Jurists Union]] ({{lang-tr|Büyük Hukukçular Birliği}}), the same group that filed a complaint against Orhan Pamuk, filed charges against Joost Lagendijk for violating Article 301 by insulting the Turkish army. The prosecutor, however, declined to prosecute, referring to the [[Turkish constitution]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], as well as a judgement by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] concerning the interpretation of that Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartstaes.be/turkije.php?id=5 Vrijheid van meningsuiting reden Lagendijk niet te vervolgen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132730/http://www.bartstaes.be/turkije.php?id=5 |date=2011-07-06 }} ("Freedom of expression ground not to prosecute Lagendijk") February 8, 2006 {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Strong Turkey Party]] organized a campaign of [[civil disobedience]] against the article called ''Try me too 301'' ({{lang-tr|Beni de yargıla 301}}).  301 members of the party knowingly violated the article 301 and filed complaints against themselves.  The prosecutor refused to file charges.

==Criticism and impact of the article==
In its short life the article has been heavily criticized, both in Turkey and outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Current status==

* replacement of the word "Turkishness" with the phrase "the Turkish Nation" (so "denigration of Turkishness" became "denigration of the Turkish Nation");
* reduction of the maximum penalty from three years to two;
* removal of the special provision aggravating the punishment for denigration when committed by a Turkish citizen in another country;
* requiring permission of the justice ministry to file a case. The permission procedure of Article 301 will be carried out by the Directorate General of the Criminal Affairs of the Ministry of Justice where competent judges are seconded to the Ministry. Even if a criminal investigation is launched upon the permission of the Minister of Justice, the prosecutor still has discretionary power to decide not to prosecute.

In 2011, the European Court of Human Rights decided that "the scope of the terms under Article 301 of the Criminal Code, as interpreted by the judiciary, is too wide and vague and thus the provision constitutes a continuing threat to the exercise of the right to freedom of expression" and "that Article 301 of the Criminal Code does not meet the “quality of law” required by the Court’s settled case-law, since its unacceptably broad terms result in a lack of foreseeability as to its effects",&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-107206 ECtHR judgment of 25/10/2011 on application No. 27520/07] Para. 93, 95&lt;/ref&gt; finding a violation of freedom of expression (Article 10 of ECHR) in the investigation against Mr [[Altuğ Taner Akçam]], a historian writing about the Armenian genocide. Concerning the 2008 amendments, ECHR noted that "despite the replacement of the term “Turkishness” by “the Turkish Nation”, there seems to be no change or major difference in the interpretation of these concepts because they have been understood in the same manner by the Court of Cassation" (Para. 92).

The '''Ashley Montagu Resolution''' refers to the petition to the [[World Court]] to end the [[genital modification and mutilation]] of children worldwide.

Endorsement of the petition also includes the 1989 ''Universal Declaration on Circumcision, Excision, and Incision'' which holds that medically unnecessary surgical [[circumcision]]s, [[:wikt:excision|excision]]s and incisions on male and female [[genitals]] constitute an ''act of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment'' within the terms of Article 5 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

The original endorsers include Nobel Laureate in Physiology and Medicine [[Francis Crick]] and [[National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers]] founder [[Marilyn Milos]]. The petition has also been signed by at least two [[Nobel Prize]] winners and [[Jonas Salk]].

The '''Brand Standard Identification Number (BSIN)''' is a 6-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://product.okfn.org/brand/ OKFN Brand Repository Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The origins of BSIN come from the worldwide product repository of [[OKFN]]: To integrate a product, a brand must be assigned.
The [[OKFN]] project "Open Product Data" uses BSIN codes in its product repository.&lt;ref&gt;http://product-open-data.com&lt;/ref&gt;
Each brand of the [[OKFN]] brand repository is given a unique BSIN.
The first version of the brand repository has been launched on the 20th of December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://product.okfn.org/2013/12/20/brand-standard-identifier-number-bsin-open-product-data-working-group-launches-a-brand-repository/ Launch announcement ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The BSIN code is composed if 6 alphanumeric characters. letters are uppercase and '0' and 'O' are excluded to avoid confusions.
When a BSIN code is created, it can physically be destroyed or replaced. When it is deleted, its status becomes "deleted" and the reason of the deletion is always provided.
The objective is to ensure users of the reliability and the stability of the BSIN.

There are two types of brands: 
* manufacturer brand
* retailer brand

== Roadmap ==

The concept of "owner" will be used to gather brands belonging to big manufacturers such as Unilever, Pesico,... 
The second objective is to avoid confusion between the brand and the company belonging the brand. For example, The Coca-Cola company (owner) belongs Cola-Cola (brand), coca zero (brand),...

[[File:Jacob M. Howard - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator from Michigan [[Jacob M. Howard]], author of the [[Citizenship Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]]]
'''Birthright citizenship in the United States''' is acquired by virtue of the circumstances of birth. It contrasts with citizenship acquired in other ways, for example by [[naturalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|8|1101|a|23}} ("The term 'naturalization' means the conferring of nationality of a state upon a person after birth, ''by any means whatsoever.''") (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and the [[Immigration and Nationality Act]] (INA), U.S. citizenship is automatically granted to any person born within and subject to the jurisdiction of the [[United States]] (known as ''[[jus soli]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|8|1401}} ("Nationals and citizens of United States at birth").&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the [[Territories of the United States|territories]] of [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Marianas]] ([[Guam]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]), and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{uscsub|8|1101|a|36}} (defining "State") and {{uscsub|8|1101|a|38}} (defining "United States").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weiner|1998|p=238}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Birthright citizenship also applies to children born elsewhere in the world to U.S. citizens (with certain exceptions), known as ''[[jus sanguinis]]''.

The policy stems from the [[Citizenship Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], stating "[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside," and was meant to override the 1857 ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' decision that denied African Americans citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Rogers M. |title=Birthright Citizenship and the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 and 2008 |journal=University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law |volume=11 |issue=5 |year=2009 |pages=1329–1336 |url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/upjcl11&amp;i=1339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of birthright citizenship to children of [[Illegal immigration to the United States|undocumented immigrants]] remains controversial among right-wing politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/17/understanding-trumps-plan-to-end-citizenship-for-undocumented-immigrants-kids/|title=Understanding Trump's plan to end citizenship for undocumented immigrants' kids|publisher=Washington Post|author=Max Ehrenfreund|date=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pew Hispanic Center]] estimates that approximately 7.5% of all births in the U.S. (about 300,000 births per year) are to unauthorized immigrants.&lt;ref name=WSJNumbers&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2015/08/20/birthright-citizenship-by-the-numbers-the-numbers/ Wall Street Journal: "Birthright Citizenship, by the Numbers"] August 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew Hispanic Center also estimates that there are 4.5&amp;nbsp;million children who were born to unauthorized immigrants that received citizenship via birth in the United States; while the [[Migration Policy Institute]] estimates that there are 4.1&amp;nbsp;million children. Both estimates exclude anyone eighteen and older who might have benefited.&lt;ref name=WSJNumbers /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/26/number-of-babies-born-to-unauthorized-immigrants-in-u-s-continues-to-decline/|title=Number of babies born to unauthorized immigrants in U.S. continues to decline|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=October 30, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current U.S. law==
Citizenship in the United States is a matter of [[federal law]], governed by the [[United States Constitution]].

Since the adoption of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] on July 9, 1868, the citizenship of persons born in the United States has been controlled by its [[Citizenship Clause]], which states: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meese|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-_8N3UeXeesC&amp;pg=PA35 35]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statute, by birth within U.S.===
United States Federal law ({{UnitedStatesCode|8|1401}}) defines who is a United States citizen from birth. The following are among those listed there as persons who shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth:
* "a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof" or
* "a person born in the United States to a member of an Indian, Eskimo, Aleutian, or other aboriginal tribe" (see [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]]).
* "a person of unknown parentage found in the United States while under the age of five years, until shown, prior to his attaining the age of twenty-one years, not to have been born in the United States"
* "a person born in an outlying possession of the United States of parents one of whom is a citizen of the United States who has been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year at any time prior to the birth of such person"

====U.S. territories====

7 FAM 1121.2-1 Definition of Terms
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are special provisions governing children born in some current and former U.S. territories or possessions, including [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Panama Canal Zone]], the [[Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. For example, {{UnitedStatesCode|8|1402}} states that "All persons born in Puerto Rico [between] April 11, 1899, and ... January 13, 1941 ... residing on January 13, 1941, in Puerto Rico ... [and] persons born in Puerto Rico on or after January 13, 1941, ... are citizens of the United States at birth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=INA: Act 302 – Persons Born in Puerto Rico |url=http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-9711.html|publisher=U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Outlying possessions====
According to {{UnitedStatesCode|8|1408}} persons born (or found, and of unknown parentage, under the age of 5) in an outlying possession of the U.S. (which is defined by {{usc|8|1101}} as [[American Samoa]] and [[Swains Island]]) are [[Non-citizen US national|U.S. nationals but not citizens]], unless otherwise provided in section 1401. The U.S. State Department publication titled ''Historical Background to Acquisition by Birth in U.S. Territories and Possessions'' explains the complexities of this topic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM030201.html ''8 FAM 302.1 Historical Background to Acquisition by Birth in U.S. Territories and Possessions'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. waters and airspace====
A child born in U.S. waters or airspace is a U.S. citizen by birth. See 8 FAM 301.1-4 ("Birth in U.S. Internal Waters and Territorial Sea"),&lt;ref&gt;

===Statute, by parentage===
Under certain circumstances, children may acquire U.S. citizenship from their parents. The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] provided for birthright citizenship for children born out of U.S. jurisdiction to two citizen parents. In 1855, this was extended to children with citizen fathers and noncitizen mothers,&lt;ref&gt;10 Stat. 604&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1934, to children with citizen mothers and noncitizen fathers.&lt;ref&gt;48 Stat. 797&lt;/ref&gt; From 1940 until 1978, a child born abroad who acquired U.S. citizenship at birth but had only one U.S. citizen parent had to fulfill a "retention requirement" of residing, or being physically present, in the United States or its outlying possessions for a certain number of years before reaching a specified age. Otherwise the child would not retain the U.S. citizenship (hence the name "retention requirement"). The retention requirement was changed several times, eliminated in 1978, and subsequently eliminated with retroactive effect in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Henry J. Chang: [http://www.americanlaw.com/citabrd.html U.S. Citizenship Acquired by Birth Abroad]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Children born overseas to married parents====
The following conditions affect children born outside the U.S. and its outlying possessions to married parents (special conditions affect children [[born out of wedlock]]: see below):&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|8|1401}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If ''both'' parents are U.S. citizens, the child is a citizen if either of the parents has had residency in the U.S. prior to the child's birth
* If ''one'' parent is a U.S. citizen and the other parent is a U.S. ''national'', the child is a citizen, if the U.S. citizen parent has lived in the U.S. for a continuous period of at least one year prior to the child's birth
* If ''one'' parent is a U.S. citizen and the other parent is not a U.S. citizen or national, the child is a citizen if
** the U.S. citizen parent has been "physically present"&lt;ref&gt;including, in some circumstances, time spent overseas when a parent who is a U.S. government employee is posted overseas&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. before the child's birth for a total period of at least five years, ''and'' at least two of those five years were after the U.S. citizen parent's fourteenth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Immigration and Nationality Act § 301(g); 8 USC § 1401(g).  For children born prior to the enactment of Public Law 99-653 on November 14, 1986, the citizen parent's U.S. presence requirement is ten years, of which at least five years had to have been after the parent's fourteenth birthday.&lt;/ref&gt;
** the U.S. citizen parent has not been "physically present" for a total period of at least five years, then a U.S. citizen grandparent must have been "physically present" for at least five years.&lt;ref&gt;Form N-600/N-643, Supplement A, Application for Acquisition of Citizenship Through a Grandparent&lt;/ref&gt;

====Children born overseas to unmarried parents====
There is an asymmetry in the way citizenship status of children born overseas to unmarried parents, only one of whom is a U.S. citizen, is handled.

Title {{USC|8|1409}} paragraph (c) provides that children born abroad after December 24, 1952 to unmarried American mothers are U.S. citizens, as long as the mother has lived in the U.S. for a continuous period of at least one year at any time prior to the birth.

{{USC|8|1409}} paragraph (a) provides that children born to American fathers unmarried to the children's non-American mothers are considered U.S. citizens only if the father meets the "physical presence" conditions described above, ''and'' the father takes several actions:

* Unless deceased, has agreed to provide financial support while the child is under the age of 18 years
* Establish paternity by clear and convincing evidence and, while the person is under the age of 18 years
** the person is legitimated under the law of the person's residence or domicile,
** the father acknowledges paternity of the person in writing under oath, or
** the paternity of the person is established by adjudication of a competent court.
***{{USC|8|1409}} paragraph (a) provides that acknowledgment of paternity can be shown by acknowledging paternity under oath and in writing; having the issue adjudicated by a court; or having the child otherwise "legitimated" by law.

Because of this rule, unusual cases have arisen whereby children have been fathered by American men overseas from non-American women, brought back to the United States as babies without the mother, raised by the American father in the United States, and later held to be deportable as non-citizens in their 20s.&lt;ref name=nguyen1&gt;Findlaw.com: ''Nguyen v. INS'', {{ussc|533|53|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nguyen2&gt;''[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-2071.ZS.html Nguyen v. INS]'', 533 U.S. 53 (2001) Cornell University Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; The final element has taken an especially significant importance in these circumstances, as once the child has reached 18, the father is forever unable to establish paternity to deem his child a citizen.&lt;ref name=nguyen3&gt;Under a fact situation similar to ''Nguyen'', the effect might be different today if the child's 18th birthday were after February 27, 2001, as per the [[Child Citizenship Act of 2000]], the child might automatically become a U.S. citizen upon admission to the country as a lawful permanent resident. This type of citizenship, however, is ''not'' considered "birthright" or natural, and the subject would most likely be construed as a "naturalized" citizen. See the [https://travel.state.gov/family/adoption/info/info_457.html U.S. Department of State's page on the Child Citizenship Act of 2000].&lt;/ref&gt;

This distinction between unwed American fathers and American mothers was constructed and reaffirmed by Congress out of concern that a flood of illegitimate Korean and Vietnamese children would later claim American citizenship as a result of their parentage by American servicemen overseas fighting wars in their countries.&lt;ref name=ahumada&gt;''US v. Ahumada-Aguilar'', 189 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, American servicemen passing through in wartime may not have even learned they had fathered a child.&lt;ref name=ahumada /&gt; In 2001, the Supreme Court, by 5–4 majority in ''[[Nguyen v. INS]]'', first established the constitutionality of this gender distinction.&lt;ref name=nguyen1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nguyen2 /&gt;

===Eligibility for office of President===
[[File:NaturalBornCitizenClause.jpg|thumb|Part of the constitutional provision as it appeared in 1787]]
{{Main|Natural-born-citizen clause}}
According to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] only [[Natural Born Citizen Clause|natural born citizens]] are eligible to serve as [[President of the United States]] or as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. The text of the Constitution does not define what is meant by ''natural born'': in particular it does not specify whether there is any distinction to be made between persons whose citizenship is based on ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (parentage) and those whose citizenship is based on ''[[jus soli]]'' (birthplace). As a result, [[Natural born citizen of the United States#Eligibility challenges|controversies]] have arisen over the eligibility of a number of candidates for the office.

==Legal history==
Throughout the history of the United States, the fundamental legal principle governing citizenship has been that birth within the United States grants U.S. citizenship; although [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] persons and children of enslaved mothers, under the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', were excluded.&lt;ref&gt;

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States did not grant citizenship after the [[American Civil War]] to all former [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] until the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], which was subsequently confirmed by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. American Indian tribal members are not covered specifically by the constitutional guarantee. Those living in tribes on reservations were generally not considered citizens until passage of the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]], although by that time nearly two-thirds of American Indians were already citizens.

===English common law===

Birthright citizenship, as with much United States law, has its roots in [[English law|English common law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schuck|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6RCfAdTWiYYC&amp;pg=PA96 96]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Calvin's Case]]'', 77 Eng. Rep. 377 (1608),{{refn|Robert Calvin was born in Scotland around 1606.

This same principle was accepted by the United States as being "ancient and fundamental," i.e., well-established common law, as stated by the Supreme Court in 1898: "the Fourteenth Amendment affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens, with the exceptions or qualifications (as old as the rule itself) of children of foreign sovereigns or their ministers, or born on foreign public ships, or of enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory, and with the single additional exception of children of members of the Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes." United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898).

===Federal law===
The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] ({{USStat|1|103}}) provided the first rules to be followed by the [[United States]] in the granting of national [[citizenship]]. Since that time, [[History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States|laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States]] have undergone a number of revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Law Register|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWUuAAAAIAAJ|year=1864|publisher=D.B.

===''Dred Scott v. Sandford''===
[[File:DredScott.jpg|thumb|Dred Scott]]
Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] in the majority opinion in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' {{Ussc|60|393|1857|19|How.}} held that African Americans, whether slave or free, had never been and could never become citizens of the United States, as they were excluded by the Constitution. The political scientist Stuart Streichler writes that Taney's decision was based on "a skewed reading of history.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Streichler|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-MpsU0JSR14C&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=%22skewed+reading%22 123]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Benjamin R. Curtis]] in his dissent showed that under the [[Articles of Confederation]], free blacks had already been considered citizens in five states and carried that citizenship forward when the Constitution was ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Streichler|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-MpsU0JSR14C&amp;pg=PA126 126]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Curtis wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first section of the second article of the Constitution uses the language "a natural-born citizen." It thus assumes that citizenship may be acquired by birth. Undoubtedly, this language of the Constitution was used in reference to that principle of public law, well understood in the history of this country at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, which referred Citizenship to the place of birth. At the Declaration of Independence, and ever since, the received general doctrine has been, in conformity with the common law, that free persons born within either of the colonies, were the subjects of the King; that by the Declaration of independence, and the consequent acquisition of sovereignty by the several States, all such persons ceased to be subjects, and became citizens of the several States ... The Constitution has left to the States the determination what person, born within their respective limits, shall acquire by birth citizenship of the United States ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Howard |first=Benjamin C. |title=A Report of the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States and the Opinions of the Judges Thereof, in the Case of ''Dred Scott Versus John F.

===1862 opinion of the Attorney General of the United States ===
In 1862, [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] sent a question to [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Edward Bates]] asking whether or not "colored men" can be citizens of the United States. Attorney General Bates responded on November 29, 1862, with a 27-page opinion concluding, "I conclude that the ''free man of color'', mentioned in your letter, if born in the ''United States'', is a citizen of the United States, ..." [italics in original]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bates |first=Edward |year=1862 |title=Opinion of Attorney General Bates on Citizenship |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zo5EJE0sorgC |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Government Printing Office |oclc=252308921 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zo5EJE0sorgC&amp;pg=PA26 26–27]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of that opinion, Bates commented at some length on the nature of citizenship, and wrote,

{{quote|... our constitution, in speaking of ''natural born citizens'', uses no affirmative language to make them such, but only recognizes and reaffirms the universal principle, common to all nations, and as old as political society, that the people born in a country do constitute the nation, and, as individuals, are ''natural'' members of the body politic.

If this be a true principle, and I do not doubt it, it follows that every person born in a country is, at the moment of birth, ''prima facie'' a citizen; and who would deny it must take upon himself the burden of proving some great disfranchisement strong enough to override the ''natural born'' right as recognized by the Constitution in terms the most simple and comprehensive, and without any reference to race or color, or any other accidental circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bates |first=Edward |year=1862 |title=Opinion of Attorney General Bates on Citizenship |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zo5EJE0sorgC |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Government Printing Office |oclc=252308921 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zo5EJE0sorgC&amp;pg=PA12 12]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [italics in original]}}

===Civil Rights Act of 1866===
&lt;!-- After the end of the [[American Civil War]], the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] moved to grant citizenship to [[freedmen|freed slaves]]. Their first action was the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], which--&gt;The [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] declared: "... all persons born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1866 Civil Rights Act|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reconstruction/activism/ps_1866.html|work=14 Stat. 27–30|accessdate=January 7, 2016|date=April 9, 1866}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Indians not taxed" referred to tribal members living on reservations.)

===Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution===
Since the adoption of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] on July 9, 1868, citizenship of persons born in the United States has been controlled by its [[Citizenship Clause]], which states: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

===Expatriation Act of 1868===
{{Main|Expatriation Act of 1868}}
This act, a companion piece to the Fourteenth Amendment, was approved on July 27, 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Expatriation Act|url=http://www.14th-amendment.com/Statutes_Proclamations/Statutes/FORTIETH_CONGRESS-Sess._II.-Ch._249/page_frame.htm|publisher=14th-amendment.com}}, quoting {{Harvnb|Sanger|1869|pp=[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=015/llsl015.db&amp;recNum=256 223–224]}}.&lt;!-- The 14th-Amendment.com link was provided for ease of cut &amp; paste --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Noting claims that immigrants to the United States, despite having become naturalized citizens, were still being treated as "subjects of foreign states, owing allegiance to the governments thereof", it declared that "the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people" and that any action by U.S. officials "which denies, restricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation is hereby declared inconsistent with the fundamental principles of this government".--&gt;

The Expatriation Act of 1868 led President [[Ulysses S.

In fact, there is no relationship at all between the two. The act was written in a different year, by different authors, on a different subject, and in a different Congress, than the Fourteenth Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.publicsquare.net/2011/04/birthright-citizenship-fourteenth-amendment/&lt;/ref&gt;

===1873 opinion of the Attorney General===
In 1873, The [[Attorney General of the United States]] published the following legal opinion concerning the Fourteenth Amendment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The word 'jurisdiction' must be understood to mean absolute and complete jurisdiction, such as the United States had over its citizens before the adoption of this amendment. Aliens, among whom are persons born here and naturalized abroad, dwelling or being in this country, are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States only to a limited extent. Political and military rights and duties do not pertain to them.&lt;ref&gt;14 ''U.S. Attorney General Opinions'' 300.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Attorney General clarified this remark as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The child born of alien parents in the United States is held to be a citizen thereof, and to be subject to duties with regard to this country which do not attach to the father. The same principle on which such children are held by us to be citizens of the United States, and to be subject to duties to this country, applies to the children of American fathers born without the jurisdiction of the United States, and entitles the country within whose jurisdiction they are born to claim them as citizen and to subject them to duties to it. Such children are born to a double character: the citizenship of the father is that of the child so far as the laws of the country of which the father is a citizen are concerned, and within the jurisdiction of that country; but the child, from the circumstances of his birth, may acquire rights and owes another fealty besides that which attaches to the father.&lt;ref&gt;Opinions of the Executive Departments on Expatriation, Naturalization and Allegiance (1873) 17, 18; U.S. Foreign Relations, 1873-74, pp. 1191, 1192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Indian Citizenship Act of 1924===
{{Main|Indian Citizenship Act of 1924}}
The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924&lt;ref&gt;43 ''[[United States Statutes at Large]]'' 253.&lt;/ref&gt; provided "That all noncitizen Indians born within the territorial limits of the United States be, and they are hereby, declared to be citizens of the United States". This same provision (slightly reworded) is contained in present-day law as section 301(b) of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] (8 [[United States Code|USC]] 1401(b)).

==U.S. Supreme Court case law==

===Sailor's Snug Harbor===
In the case of ''[[Inglis v. Trustees of Sailor's Snug Harbor]]'', {{ussc|28|99|1830}} the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decided the question of the disposition of the estate of a man born in [[New York State]] in 1776. The Supreme Court resolved complicated questions of how citizenship had been derived during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. The court found that the [[jus soli]] is so consistent in American Law as to automatically grant American citizenship to children born in [[New York City]] between the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Landing at Kip's Bay]] in 1776, but not to children born in New York during the British occupation that followed.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/28/99/case.html Inglis v. Trustees of Sailor's Snug Harbor]'', 28 U.S. 99 (1830), [http://supreme.justia.com/ U.S. Supreme Court Center], [http://www.justia.com/ justia.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nothing is better settled at the common law than the doctrine that the children even of aliens born in a country while the parents are resident there under the protection of the government and owing a temporary allegiance thereto are subjects by birth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Slaughter-House Cases===
In the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'', {{ussc|83|36|1873}}—a civil rights case not dealing specifically with birthright citizenship—a majority of the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] mentioned in passing that "the phrase 'subject to its jurisdiction' was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign States born within the United States".&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/83/36/case.html#73 83 U.S. at 73].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'', {{ussc|112|94|1884}}, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] denied the birthright citizenship claim of an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]. The court ruled that being born in the territory of the United States is not sufficient for citizenship; those who wish to claim citizenship by birth must be born subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The court's majority held that the children of Native Americans were

{{quote|no more "born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof," within the meaning of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, than the children of subjects of any foreign government born within the domain of that government, or the children born within the United States of ambassadors or other public ministers of foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/112/94/case.html#102 112 U.S. at 102].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, Native Americans who voluntarily quit their tribes would not automatically become U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Urofsky |first=Melvin I. |last2=Finkelman |first2=Paul |author2-link=Paul Finkelman |title=A March of Liberty: A Constitutional History of the United States |edition=2nd |publisher=Oxford University Press |place=New York, NY |year=2002 |volume=1 |isbn=978-0-19-512635-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQVDZ9jg8m0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans were granted U.S. citizenship by Congress half a century later in the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]], which rendered the ''Elk'' decision obsolete.

===''United States v. Wong Kim Ark''===
[[File:WongKimArk.gif|thumb|right|upright|Wong Kim Ark, in a photograph taken from a 1904 U.S. immigration document|alt=Wong Kim Ark (1904)]]
In the case of ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'', {{ussc|169|649|1898}}, the Supreme Court was presented with the following question:  {{quote|[Whether a] child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicil and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his birth a citizen of the United States, by virtue of the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, "All person born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."}}

The decision centered upon the 14th Amendment's reference to "jurisdiction," and concluded:

{{quote|the Fourteenth Amendment affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens, with the exceptions or qualifications (as old as the rule itself) of children of foreign sovereigns or their ministers, or born on foreign public ships, or of enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory, and with the single additional exception of children of members of the Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes. The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States. Every citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the United States. His allegiance to the United States is direct and immediate, and, although but local and temporary, continuing only so long as he remains within our territory, is yet, in the words of Lord Coke in Calvin's Case, 7 Rep. 6a, "strong enough to make a natural subject, for if he hath issue here, that issue is a natural-born subject;" and his child, as said by Mr. Binney in his essay before quoted, "if born in the country, is as much a citizen as the natural-born child of a citizen, and by operation of the same principle."}}

==Canadians transferred to U.S. hospitals==
Since the majority of [[Canada|Canadians]] live in the relatively thin strip of land close to the [[Canada–United States border|long border with the United States]], Canadians in need of urgent medical care are occasionally transferred to nearby American medical centers. In some circumstances, Canadian mothers facing high-risk births have given birth in American [[hospital]]s. Such children are American citizens by birthright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://komonews.com/news/local/some-canadian-mothers-forced-to-give-birth-in-us|title=Some Canadian mothers forced to give birth in U.S.|publisher=KOMO TV News|accessdate=July 22, 2016|date=October 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these circumstances, Canadian laws are similar to those of the United States. Babies born in Canada of American parents are also [[Canadian nationality law|Canadian citizens]] by birthright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.canlii.org/ca/sta/c-29/sec3.html|title=Citizenship Act PART I: THE RIGHT TO CITIZENSHIP|publisher=Federation of Law Societies of Canada|accessdate=February 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both of these situations, the birthright citizenship is passed on to their children, born decades later. In some cases, births in American hospital (sometimes called "'''border babies'''") have resulted in persons who lived for much of their lives in Canada, but not knowing that they had never had official Canadian citizenship. This group of people is sometimes called [[Lost Canadians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Another problem arises where a Canadian child, born to Canadian parents in a U.S. border hospital, is treated as a [[dual citizen]] and added to the United States tax base on this basis despite having never lived, worked nor studied in that nation. While Canadian income tax is only payable by those who reside or earn income in Canada, the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] taxes its citizens worldwide. [[Campobello Island]] is particularly problematic as, while legally part of [[New Brunswick]], the only year-round fixed link off the island leads not to Canada but to [[Lubec, Maine]]—leading to many Canadians whose families have lived on Campobello for generations not being able to claim to be born in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pressherald.com/news/Challenges-for-Campobello-Island-A-crossing-to-bear.html?pagenum=full | title=Challenges for Campobello Island: A crossing to bear| date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political controversies==

===Original meaning===
During the original debate over the 14th Amendment Senator [[Jacob M. Howard]] of Michigan—the sponsor of the Amendment, though the Citizenship Clause was written by Senator Wadw—described the clause as having the same content, despite different wording, as the earlier [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], namely, that it excludes American Indians who maintain their tribal ties and "persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893 Senator [[Reverdy Johnson]] said in the debate: "Now, all this amendment provides is, that all persons born in the United States and not subject to some foreign Power—for that, no doubt, is the meaning of the committee who have brought the matter before us—shall be considered as citizens of the United States ... If there are to be citizens of the United States entitled everywhere to the character of citizens of the United States, there should be some certain definition of what citizenship is, what has created the character of citizen as between himself and the United States, and the amendment says citizenship may depend upon birth, and I know of no better way to give rise to citizenship than the fact of birth within the territory of the United States, born of parents who at the time were subject to the authority of the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; Others also agreed that the children of ambassadors and foreign ministers were to be excluded.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2897.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=070/llcg070.db&amp;recNum=702 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 572.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the children born in the United States to parents who are not U.S. citizens (and not foreign diplomats), three senators, including [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman]] [[Lyman Trumbull]], the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]], agreed, asserting that both the Civil Rights Act and the 14th Amendment would confer citizenship on them at birth, and no senator offered a contrary opinion.&lt;ref name=trumbullcowan&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 498. The debate on the Civil Rights Act contained the following exchange:&lt;br&gt;Mr. Cowan: "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"&lt;br&gt;Mr. Trumbull: "Undoubtedly."&lt;br&gt; ... &lt;br&gt;Mr. Trumbull: "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."&lt;br&gt;Mr. Cowan: "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."&lt;br&gt;Mr. Trumbull: "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2891–2. During the debate on the Amendment, Senator [[John Conness]] of California declared, "The proposition before us, I will say, Mr. President, relates simply in that respect to the children begotten of Chinese parents in California, and it is proposed to declare that they shall be citizens. We have declared that by law [the Civil Rights Act]; now it is proposed to incorporate that same provision in the fundamental instrument of the nation. I am in favor of doing so. I voted for the proposition to declare that the children of all parentage, whatever, born in California, should be regarded and treated as citizens of the United States, entitled to equal Civil Rights with other citizens.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1944 See veto message] by President Andrew Johnson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the debate on this section of the Amendment centered on whether the wording in the Civil Rights Act or Howard's proposal more effectively excluded Aboriginal Americans on reservations and in U.S. territories from citizenship. Senator [[James R. Doolittle]] of Wisconsin asserted that all Native Americans are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, so that the phrase "Indians not taxed" would be preferable,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=11 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2890, 2892–4, 2896.&lt;/ref&gt; but Trumbull and Howard disputed this, arguing that the U.S. government did not have full jurisdiction over Native American tribes, which govern themselves and make treaties with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=14 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893. [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman]] [[Lyman Trumbull]], participating in the debate, stated the following: "What do we [the committee reporting the clause] mean by 'subject to the jurisdiction of the United States'? Not owing allegiance to anybody else. That is what it means." He then proceeded to expound upon what he meant by "complete jurisdiction": "Can you sue a Navajoe Indian in court? ... We make treaties with them, and therefore they are not subject to our jurisdiction ... If we want to control the Navajoes, or any other Indians of which the Senator from Wisconsin has spoken, how do we do it? Do we pass a law to control them? Are they subject to our jurisdiction in that sense? ... Would he [Sen. Doolittle] think of punishing them for instituting among themselves their own tribal regulations? Does the Government of the United States pretend to take jurisdiction of murders and robberies and other crimes committed by one Indian upon another? ... It is only those persons who come completely within our jurisdiction, who are subject to our laws, that we think of making citizens."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=howard2&gt;''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=073/llcg073.db&amp;recNum=16 Congressional Globe]'', 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2895. Howard additionally stated the word jurisdiction meant "the same jurisdiction in extent and quality as applies to every citizen of the United States now" and that the United States possessed a "full and complete jurisdiction" over the person described in the amendment.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Erler argued that since the ''Wong Kim Ark'' case dealt with someone whose parents were in the United States legally, there is no valid basis under the 14th Amendment for the practice of granting citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants: "Even if the logic is that Wong Kim Ark became a citizen by birth with the permission of the United States when it admitted his parents to the country, no such permission has been given to those who enter illegally."&lt;ref&gt;Erler et al., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yTA0NyesVbcC&amp;pg=PA67 The Founders on Citizenship and Immigration: Principles and Challenges in America]'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akhil Amar]] responded to Erler, "I'm not sure that his [[Pandora's box]] can be limited to children of illegal aliens.  It is a thin edge of a very big and dangerous wedge that I think runs squarely into ''Wong Kim Ark''."&lt;ref name="Rosen" /&gt; Similarly, Angelo Ancheta criticized the "consent-based theory of citizenship", saying that "The Fourteenth Amendment was designed to ensure citizenship for 'all persons' born in the United States, particularly in response to ambiguities in legal status that attached to being the descendants of an outsider class, namely slaves."&lt;ref&gt;Angelo N. Ancheta, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uc_q6upNmugC&amp;pg=PA103 ''Race, Rights, and the Asian American Experience''], p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to birthright citizenship===
In the late 1990s opposition arose over the longstanding practice of granting automatic citizenship on a ''jus soli'' basis.&lt;ref name="CRSReport"&gt;{{citation |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/data/2006/upl-meta-crs-9011/RL33079_2006May12.pdf?PHPSESSID=1ca373c497c7db6a81c7ca74a1445530.pdf

During that debate, Senator [[Edgar Cowan]] of Pennsylvania objected to the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment. 'Is the child of the Chinese immigrant in California a citizen?' he asked on the Senate floor. Senator [[John Conness]] of California said the answer should be 'yes.' 'The children of all parentage whatever, born in California, should be regarded and treated as citizens of the United States, entitled to equal civil rights with other citizens,' Mr. Conness said.", {{citation

A [[Pew Hispanic Center]] analysis of Census Bureau data determined that about 8 percent of children born in the United States in 2008—about 340,000—were offspring of "unauthorized immigrants". In total, about four million American-born children of unauthorized immigrant parents resided in this country in 2009, along with about 1.1&amp;nbsp;million foreign-born children of unauthorized immigrant parents.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=125 Unauthorized Immigrants and Their U.S.-Born Children]," Pew Hispanic Center, August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Center for Immigration Studies]]—a think tank which favors stricter controls on immigration—claims that between 300,000 and 400,000 children are born each year to illegal immigrants in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel González and Dan Nowicki. "[http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2011/03/20/20110320birthright-citizenship-illegal-immigration.html Birthright citizenship change would have wide effects]." ''[[Arizona Republic]]'', March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cis.org"&gt;Jon Feere, "[http://www.cis.org/birthright-citizenship Birthright Citizenship in the United States: A Global Comparison]." Center for Immigration Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bills have been introduced from time to time in [[United States Congress|Congress]] which have sought to declare American-born children of foreign nationals not to be "subject to the jurisdiction of the United States", and thus not entitled to citizenship via the 14th Amendment, unless at least one parent was an American citizen or a lawful [[permanent resident]].

Both Democrats and Republicans have introduced legislation aimed at narrowing the application of the Citizenship Clause. In 1993, Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) introduced legislation that would limit birthright citizenship to the children of U.S. citizens and legally resident aliens, and similar bills have been introduced by other legislators in every Congress since.&lt;ref name="cis.org"/&gt; For example, [[U.S. Representative]] [[Nathan Deal]], a Republican from the [[State of Georgia]], introduced the "[[Citizenship Reform Act of 2005]]" (H.R. 698) in the [[109th Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.698.IH: Citizenship Reform Act of 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; the "Birthright Citizenship Act of 2007" (H.R. 1940)&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.1940: Birthright Citizenship Act of 2007].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[110th Congress]], and the "Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009" (H.R. 1868)&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.1868.IH: Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[111th Congress]]. However, neither these nor any similar bill has ever been passed by Congress.

Some legislators, unsure whether such [[Act of Congress|Acts of Congress]] would survive court challenges, have proposed that the Citizenship Clause be changed through a [[constitutional amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Representative [[Anthony Beilenson]] (D-CA). "[http://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc0701/article_584.shtml Case for Correction By Constitutional Amendment]." ''[[The Social Contract]]''. Volume 7, Number 1 (Fall 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Senate Joint Resolution 6, introduced on January 16, 2009 in the 111th Congress, proposes such an amendment;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, neither this, nor any other proposed amendment, has yet been approved by Congress for ratification by the states.

President [[Donald Trump]] said on October 30, 2018 that he intends to remove, by means of an [[executive order]], the right of citizenship to people born in the U.S. to foreign nationals.&lt;ref name="cnntrump"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Da Silva |first1=Chantal |title=Trump Says He Plans to Sign Executive Order to Terminate Birthright Citizenship |url=https://www.newsweek.com/trump-says-he-plans-sign-executive-order-terminate-birthright-citizenship-1192823 |accessdate=October 30, 2018 |publisher=CNN |date=October 30, 2018}} Includes video.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MWatch10302018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schroeder |first1=Robert |title=Trump Today: President says he’s preparing order to end birthright citizenship |url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-today-president-says-hes-preparing-order-to-end-birthright-citizenship-2018-10-30 |accessdate=October 30, 2018 |publisher=Market Watch |date=October 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors''' ('''BASCA''') is one of the largest professional associations for music writers in Europe and exists to support, protect and campaign for the interests of songwriters, lyricists and composers. It represents music writers in all genres, from song writing to media, contemporary classical to jazz and has approximately 2000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-c4e-sub-mpa.pdf|title=The Response of the British Academy of Composers Songwriters and Authors to the call for evidence of the independent review of intellectual property and growth|website=Ipo.gov.uk|date=March 2011|accessdate=4 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301094629/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview-c4e-sub-mpa.pdf#|archive-date=2012-03-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BASCA exists to support and protect the professional interests of songwriters, lyricists and composers of all genres of music and to celebrate and encourage excellence in British music writing.

==History==
The Composers Guild of Great Britain was founded in 1944 to represent composers of classical music, with [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] elected as first President. The Songwriters' Guild of Great Britain, later known as The British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors was founded in 1947 by Ivor Novello, Sir Alan Herbert, Eric Coates, Haydn Wood, Richard Addinsell and others for the encouragement and protection of British popular music&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/SPYmaschwitz.htm|title=Eric Maschwitz|website=Spartacus-educational.com|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with Eric Maschwitz acting as the first Vice Chair, and Chairman in 1948, and again between 1954 and 1958. The Association of Professional Composers was founded in 1976 by [[George Fenton]] to represent composers of film and TV music. In 1958 the Composers' Guild of Great Britain began publishing the journal ''Composer'', and also published a number of catalogs of available works. In 1967 the organisation, under the direction of [[Ruth Gipps]], established the [[British Music Information Centre]].

In 1999 The Association of Professional Composers (APC) and the Composers' Guild of Great Britain (CGGB) merged with the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors to provide a single, more powerful amalgamated organisation to represent its membership. The organization's current name was adopted in March, 2009. [[Sir Tim Rice]] was elected first president, and [[Guy Fletcher (songwriter)|Guy Fletcher]] and [[David Stoll (composer)|David Stoll]] served as joint chairs of a nine-member Board of Directors. Three executive committees were established to administer Pop and Theatrical Music, Concert Music and Media. BASCA now has four genre committees representing Songwriters, Classical, Jazz and Media composers.

Members of BASCA include emerging songwriters and the United Kingdom's "most experienced and successful writers." A partial list of the past and present members includes [[David Arnold]] (fellow), [[Harrison Birtwistle]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] (fellow), [[George Fenton]], [[Guy Garvey]], [[Howard Goodall]], [[Annie Lennox]] (fellow), [[Elton John]] (fellow), and [[Paul McCartney]] (fellow). [[Rolling Stones]] members [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Richards]] are members, as are [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Pete Townshend]], [[Imogen Heap]], [[David Gilmour]], [[George Michael]], [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]], [[Benson Taylor]], [[Chris Martin]], [[Lynsey de Paul]], [[Cathy Dennis]], [[Kate Bush]], [[Mika (singer)|Mika]], [[Evelyn Glennie]], [[Gary Barlow]], [[Chrissie Hynde]], [[Sharleen Spiteri]], and [[Thom Yorke]].

BASCA is a member of [[UK Music]], an umbrella organisation which represents the collective interests of the production side of UK's commercial music industry: artists, musicians, songwriters, composers, record labels, artist managers, music publishers, studio producers and music collecting societies.

Songwriter [[Crispin Hunt]] became the chairman of BASCA in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.m-magazine.co.uk/news/crispin-hunt-appointed-basca-chairman&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 The Songwriters' Guild of Great Britain established the [[Ivor Novello Awards]] to honour excellence in British music writing. The award is considered to be "prestigious."&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/7588396/Spotify-accused-of-ripping-off-artists-amid-claims-it-pays-just-100-for-a-million-plays.html |title=Spotify accused of ripping off artists amid claims it pays just £100 for a million plays |first1=Ben |last1=Leach |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 the Academy established the Gold Badge Awards for individuals who make outstanding contributions to Britain’s music and entertainment industry, sponsored annually by [[PRS for Music]]. The organization also presents the British Composer Awards for excellence in classical and jazz music, also sponsored by the [[PRS for Music]] and in association with [[BBC Radio 3]].

BASCA exists to support and protect the professional interests of songwriters, lyricists and composers of all genres of music and to celebrate and encourage excellence in British music writing.

Its aims and objectives are:
#To campaign as a leading force in the domestic and international political arenas
#To celebrate excellence through world-class awards ceremonies – the Ivor Novello Awards, the British Composer Awards and the Gold Badge Awards
#To inform our members in a constantly changing environment through our publications, websites and seminars
#To foster a sense of community amongst British songwriters, composers and lyricists
#To encourage the next generation of professional music writers.

The organization provides ''[[pro bono]]'' legal services, insurance cover, model contracts, a tax helpline, professional development seminars and master-classes, online promotion, a collaboration service, networking opportunities, publications and newsletters.&lt;ref name="UBR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsignedbandreview.com/british-academy-of-songwriters-composers-and-authors.html|title=British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors|date=18 May 2009|website=Unsignedbandreview.com|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to BASCA’s campaigning agenda currently is the digital royalties campaign: '''The Day The Music Died'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://basca.org.uk/public-affairs/thedaythemusicdied/|title=BASCA Digital Royalties Campaign – The Day The Music Died|website=Basca.org.uk|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this vehicle, the organisation advocates for a fairer environment for songwriters and composers by addressing the major problem areas threatening the value and security of creators’ rights.

The campaign is calling for:

• A 50/50 split in gross royalty income for writers from digital services (as in broadcasting).

• A higher proportion of advertising income.

• The removal of auto predictive fill in of illegal content with internet search engines (e.g.: Google searches and alerts).

• The removal of safe harbour for active content platforms such asYouTube.

• More transparency around non-disclosure agreements for writers so they clearly understand how and what they are being paid.

2015 saw a big victory for the UK Music industry after BASCA, the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musician’s Union]] and [[UK Music]] won an important copyright Judicial Review in the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/basca-v-sofs-bis-judgment.pdf|title=High Court Judgement|last=|first=|date=19 June 2015|website=Judiciary.gov.uk|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this procedure, they challenged the Government’s decision to introduce a private copying exception into UK copyright law without providing fair compensation to rights to rights holders (as required by EU law).

Throughout the BBC's charter renewal process, BASCA focussed on speaking out about protecting the [[BBC]] (and its music services) from cuts. It made three formal submissions to government on the BBC including the DCMS public consultation. Many of BASCA’s members publicly supported UK Music’s #letitbeeb campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukmusic.org/policy/letitbeeb/|title=Let It Beeb|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=Ukmusic.org|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Paul McCartney|BASCA Fellow Sir Paul McCartney]] and gathered more than 10K signatures.

BASCA has also responded to many European Commission’s consultations over the past few years including an investigation into the ‘Regulatory Environment for Platforms, Online Intermediaries, Data and Cloud Computing and the Collaborative Economy’. It remains a vital part of ECSA the European Composer and Songwriter Alliance.

BASCA is also involved in the process to select the United Kingdom's entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|Eurovision Song Contest.]]

The '''British Supreme Court for China''' (originally the '''British Supreme Court for China and Japan''') was a [[court]] established in the [[Shanghai International Settlement]] to try cases against [[British subjects]] in [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] under the principles of [[extraterritoriality]].

The court also heard appeals from [[consular court]]s in China, Japan and Korea and from the [[British Court for Japan]] which was established in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Supreme Court of China and Japan, establishment|url= http://www.law.mq.edu.au/research/colonial_case_law/colonial_cases/less_developed/china_and_japan/supreme_court_establishment/|newspaper= The North China Herald|location= Shanghai|date= 29 July 1865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Court==
[[File:The Signing of the Treaty of Nanking.jpg|thumb|left|Signing of the Treaty of Nanking]]
Britain had acquired [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial rights]] in China under the [[Treaty of Nanking]] in 1842.  The United States obtained further extraterritorial rights under the [[Treaty of Wanghia|Treaty of Wanghsia]], which Britain was able to take advantage of under the [[Most Favoured Nation]] provision in a Supplemental Agreement to the [[Treaty of Nanking]]. Subsequently, under the [[Treaty of Tientsin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | title=Treaty of Tien-Tsin between the Queen of Great Britain and the Emperor of China | year=1858}}, ratified in 1860&lt;/ref&gt; these rights were provided for directly in a Sino-British Treaty. In 1858, Britain obtained extraterritorial rights in Japan under the [[Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce]].

The Treaty of Tientsin specified how such jurisdiction was to be governed:
[[File:Signing the Treaty of Tientsin.jpg|thumb|right|Signing of the Treaty of Tientsin]]
#Disputes between British subjects would "be subject to the jurisdiction of the British authorities."&lt;ref&gt;Treaty of Tientsin, art. XV&lt;/ref&gt;
#For criminal acts, Chinese subjects would be arrested and punished by the Chinese authorities, according to Chinese law. In similar fashion, British subjects tried and punished by the Consul, "or other public functionary authorized thereto," according to British law.&lt;ref&gt;Treaty of Tientsin, art. XVI&lt;/ref&gt;
#Where a British subject wished to lodge a complaint against a Chinese subject, or ''[[vice versa]]'', it had to be presented to the British consul, who would "do his utmost to arrange it amicably." Failing that, "he shall request the assistance of the Chinese authorities, that they may together examine into the merits of the case, and decide it equitably."&lt;ref&gt;Treaty of Tientsin, art. XVII&lt;/ref&gt;
#In civil matters, Chinese authorities would enforce debts owed by Chinese subjects to British subjects, and British authorities would do likewise for those owed by British subjects to Chinese subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Treaty of Tientsin, art. XXII&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdiction in the first instance, as well as in matters involving British defendants, was vested in the British consular courts, while in the [[Shanghai International Settlement]] matters relating to criminal acts and debt enforcement involving Chinese defendants were vested in a "Mixed Court" (''{{transl|zh|Yangjingbang lishi gongxie}}'',{{sfn|Cassel|2012|p=67}} later known as {{zh | s=会审公廨| hp=Huìshěn gōng xiè| labels=no}}).{{sfn|Cassel|2012|p=72}} Matters relating to complaints were not considered to be judicial.{{sfn|Cassel|2012|p=67}}

Appeals from British consular courts initially went to the [[Supreme Court of Hong Kong]], which gradually became unpopular as British economic activity rose in the [[Yangtse River|Yangtse valley]].{{sfn|Cassel|2012|p=68}} The establishment of the '''British Supreme Court for China and Japan'''{{efn|formally "Her Britannic Majesty's Supreme Court for China and Japan"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 22963|date= 28 April 1865|pages=2240–2255|title=''The China and Japan Order in Council, 1865''}}&lt;/ref&gt; was not challenged from any official quarter in China, as it was seen to be not only a way to more efficiently try matters close to the scene, but also to allow Qing officials to exert direct pressure on British authorities when they were not satisfied with a sentence.{{sfn|Cassel|2012|p=68}}

In 1879, reflecting the growing British commercial interests in Japan and the inconvenience of bringing a [[first instance]] action in Shanghai, the [[British Court for Japan]] was established in [[Kanagawa-juku|Kanagawa]] (now part of [[Yokohama]]) with [[first instance]] jurisdiction in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 26416|date= 23 August 1878|pages=4767–4769|title=''The China and Japan Order in Council, 1878''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court for Japan also heard appeals from consular courts in Japan. Appeals from the Court for Japan were heard by the Chief Justice and Judge of the Supreme Court in Shanghai.

The United Kingdom later obtained extraterritoriality in [[Korea]] as a result of the [[United Kingdom–Korea Treaty of 1883]]. The court's jurisdiction was subsequently extended there in 1884, but the court's name remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 25372|date= 1 July 1884|pages=2991–2993|title=''China, Japan, and Corea Order in Council, 1884''}}, as amended by the {{London Gazette |issue= 25575|date= 6 April 1886|pages=1655–1656|title=''China, Japan, and Corea Order in Council, 1886''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the [[Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation]] of 1894, Britain gave up extraterritorial rights in Japan with effect from July 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 27127|date= 17 October 1899|pages=6234–6235|title=''Order in Council of 7 October 1899''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court was renamed the '''British Supreme Court for China and Corea''' in 1900.{{efn|formally "Her Britannic Majesty's Supreme Court for China and Corea" (1900-1901) and, later, "His Britannic Majesty's Supreme Court for China and Corea" (1901-1910)}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 27172|date= 9 March 1900|page=1618|title=''The China and Corea (Supreme Court) Order in Council, 1900''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court for Japan officially heard its last case, which had been filed before the end of July 1899, in early 1900.

Under the [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910]], Korea was annexed by Japan and Britain automatically lost extraterritorial rights in Korea. The court was, in January 1911, renamed the "British Supreme Court for China".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 28460|date= 27 January 1911|page=688|title=''The Corea Order in Council, 1911''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s there were negotiations with China to give up extraterritorial rights.   In  1930 and 1931, after the [[Kuomingtang]] consolidated their rule in China, Britain reached an agreement in principle with the Chinese Foreign Minister to give up extraterritorial rights. The Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and then Northern China in 1937 put the issue on the backburner.  The Court effectively ceased to function on 8 December 1941 when the Japanese Navy occupied the court premises at the start of the Pacific War.  After 9 months internship, either at home or in the Cathay Hotel (now the [[Peace Hotel]]), the judges and British staff of the court were evacuated to Britain aboard the SS ''Narkunda''.&lt;ref&gt;Report from Allan Mossop, Judge, to the Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs, dated 24 September 1942 FO369/2719&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, however, only in 1943 during World War II that Britain gave up extraterritorial rights in China under the [[British-Chinese Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in China]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in China and the Regulation of Related Matters (Cmd. 6456)|url = http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/pdf/1943/TS0002.pdf|date = 11 January 1943 |publisher = [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed on 11 January 1943 and which came into force on 20 May 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 36029|date= 25 May 1943|pages=2331–2332|title=''The China Order in Council, 1943''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States gave up its extraterritorial rights at the same time. The court therefore had had jurisdiction over British subjects in Korea for 27 years; in Japan for 34 years and in China for 78 years when the court was finally dissolved in 1943.

==Court buildings==

In Shanghai, the court was housed in the [[Former Consulate-General of the United Kingdom, Shanghai|British Consulate]] compound.  From 1865 to 1871 cases were heard using the rooms that had been used by the consular court.  In 1871 a dedicated court building to stand at the back of the consulate building facing on to Yuanmingyuan Road was opened.   In 1913 the building was expanded to add a Police Court (on the ground floor) and a second court (on the first floor) immediately south of the main court room.  Rooms of similar size were built to the north for consular offices.  The building still stands to this day and can be seen from Yuanmingyuan Road.

In [[Yokohama]], the [[British Court for Japan]] sat in the British Consulate building.  The building was destroyed in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]].

In other cities, when the judges of the court went on circuit to outlying cities they would generally sit in courts in British consulate buildings but on occasions would use other premises where important cases of great public interest were being heard.

==Jurisdiction==
The Court applied the rules of English law and equity to matters in difference concerning:&lt;ref&gt;''The China and Japan Order in Council, 1865'', ss. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

:* [[British subject]]s, or between foreigners and British subjects,
:* the administration or control of the property or persons of British subjects,
:* the repression or punishment of crimes or offences committed by British subjects, and
:* the maintenance of order among British subjects.

By 1904,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 27728|date= 28 October 1904|pages=6887–6909|title=''The China and Corea Order in Council, 1904''}}&lt;/ref&gt; such jurisdiction had been expanded so that it covered:

In China, the Court deferred to the [[Hong Kong Supreme Court]] in several respects, relinquishing jurisdiction over cases involving British subjects where the matter in question occurred:

:* within {{convert|10|mile|km|0}} of Hong Kong's borders,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 24516|date= 26 October 1877|pages=5791–5792|title=''Order in Council of 23 October 1877''}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Clark|2012}}
:* in [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]] between 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 27338|date= 26 July 1901|pages=4929–4939|title=''The Wei-hai-wei Order in Council, 1901''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1930,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 33683|date= 23 January 1931|pages=531–532|title=''The Wei-hai-wei Order in Council, 1930''}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Clark|2012}}

or where an offence was committed on a British ship by a British subject in Hong Kong&lt;ref&gt;''The China and Corea Order in Council, 1904'', s. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court could also decide to refer certain criminal cases involving British subjects to the Hong Kong Court, or to the Sessions Court at [[Mandalay]].&lt;ref&gt;''The China and Corea Order in Council, 1904'', s. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Referred cases were tried under English law,{{sfn|Clark|2012}} instead of Hong Kong law or Indian law.

In 1916, the companies ordinances enacted in Hong Kong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Companies Ordinance, 1911|type= Ordinance|number= 58|date= 1911|url= http://oelawhk.lib.hku.hk/items/show/1260}}; {{cite act |title= Life Insurance Companies Ordinance, 1907|type= Ordinance|number= 36|date= 1907|url= http://oelawhk.lib.hku.hk/items/show/1697}}&lt;/ref&gt; were extended to China, and companies that were constituted as a "China Company" thereunder were placed under the jurisdiction of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 29836|date= 30 November 1915|pages= 11921-11923|title= ''The China (Companies) Order in Council, 1915''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, that part of China that formed part of the British consular district of [[Kashgar]] was withdrawn from the Supreme Court's jurisdiction. From that time onwards to 1943, extraterritorial jurisdiction in that region was exercised by the [[High Court of the Punjab]], and Indian law applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 31821|date= 12 March 1920|pages=3153–3163|title=''The China (Kashgar) Order in Council, 1920''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective 26 April 1927, the Court ceased to have criminal jurisdiction over persons subject to [[military law]] in the British and Indian military forces, while on [[active service]], except if the commander of the forces consented to the court having jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 33269|date= 26 April 1927|pages=2670-2671|title=''The Foreign Jurisdiction (Military Forces) Order in Council, 1927''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
[[File:Sir Robert Hart, Baronet.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Sir Robert Hart, 1st Baronet|Robert Hart]], [[Defendant]] in ''von Gumpach v Hart'']]
The court tried cases of all descriptions, all the time applying [[English law]] in China, Japan and Korea, including murder trials before juries, divorce cases, commercial disputes, trademark and passing off claims, habeas corpus applications and cases of petty theft. Some of its cases have been posted online by [[Macquarie University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.law.mq.edu.au/research/colonial_case_law/colonial_cases/less_developed/china_and_japan/|title = Colonial cases: China and Japan|publisher = [[Macquarie University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official case reports can be found in the ''[[North China Daily News|North China Herald]]'' which was also the ''Supreme Court and Consular Gazette''.  Cases from other consular courts in Shanghai were also published in the ''North China Herald''.

Some famous cases included:

==Judges of the Court==
In its 78 years of existence from 1865 to 1943 the court had 15 full-time judges, including the first Chief Judge, Sir [[Edmund Grimani Hornby|Edmund Hornby]], [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] [[Charles Wycliffe Goodwin]]; Frederick Bourne, a recipient of thanks from the U.S. President for services rendered; an aristocrat, [[Havilland de Sausmarez]] for whom the baronetage of the [[De Sausmarez Baronets]] was created; and a recipient of a decoration from the King of Siam, [[Skinner Turner]].  The judges came from a variety of places, including from England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, the British Virgin Islands and South Africa.

Throughout its existence the court had two permanent judges at any one time.   From 1865 to 1878 and 1905 to 1943 the senior judge was titled Judge and the junior judge's title was Assistant Judge.   Between 1878 and 1905 the senior judge was titled Chief Justice and the junior judge's title was Judge.

==Crown Advocates==
[[File:Sir Nicholas Hannen.jpg|thumb|150px|Nicholas Hannen, First Crown Advocate]]
In 1878, the position of [[Crown Advocate]] was created, being similar to the position of an [[Attorney General]] in a colony. The Crown Advocate was not a full-time position in the [[Foreign Office]], but the officeholder received payment for performing his duties. He was allowed to accept cases from private clients that did not conflict with his public role. The 6 gentlemen who served in this office were:

:* [[Nicholas John Hannen]] (1878-1881)
:* [[Hiram Shaw Wilkinson]] (1882-1897)
:* [[Hiram Parkes Wilkinson]] (1897-1925) (also Judge of the British High Court of [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]] (1916-1925))
:* [[Allan Mossop|Allan George Mossop]] (1925-1933)
:* [[Victor Priestwood]] (1934-1939)
:* [[John McNeill (lawyer)|John McNeill]] (1939-1942)

Hiram Parkes Wilkinson was the son of Hiram Shaw Wilkinson.  Together they served as Crown Advocate for a total of 44 years.

'''Celle Hole''' ({{lang-de|Celler Loch}}) was a breach in the outer wall of the [[prison]] of [[Celle]], [[Germany]]. First used on July 25, 1978, the name was part of a campaign by one of the [[West Germany|West German]] secret services ([[Verfassungsschutz|Landesbehörde für Verfassungsschutz]]) and the [[GSG 9]] in an attempt to lay blame on the [[Red Army Faction]], West Germany's most active and prominent left-wing terrorist group. However, the incident was revealed in 1986 to be a plot by the government, a [[False flag]] operation, much to the embarrassment of the government. The Verfassungsschutz used the name 'Operation Fire Magic' ({{lang-de|Aktion Feuerzauber}}).

The secret services used a stolen [[Mercedes-Benz R107|Mercedes SL]], driven by two criminals named Klaus-Dieter Loudil and Manfred Berger, who were recruited by the secret services. In the car were forged passports, one passport with a photograph of [[Sigurd Debus]]. Serial numbers of the passports showed that they were stolen from German authorities. Mr. Debus was an inmate in the Celle prison. He was considered as a Red Army Faction terrorist suspect. Some tools to be used for a prison escape attempt were brought secretly to Mr. Debus' prison cell by the secret services.

[[Image:JVA Celle mauer hinter fluss.jpg|thumb|Prison wall behind the river Aller]]
The action should have had taken place one night earlier when twelve secret service officers, one GSG 9 demolition squad officer and [[Jürgen Wiehe]], a civil servant in the ministry of interior of the state of Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen) waited for the right moment to detonate the bomb on July 24. But they had to interrupt the action since two lovers coming from the nearby funfair entered the danger area. So the action was deferred.

On July 25, 1978 at 2.54 a.m. the bomb was detonated at the outer prison wall, but caused minor damage only. No inmate was able to escape. The Mercedes was caught later in [[Salzgitter]] (80&amp;nbsp;km away) in a police road block, the driver escaped. The false passports and some ammunition was found in the car.

In Celle, a 1.5 square meter hole, named the Celle hole (Celler Loch), was left in the outer prison wall. A handgun, model [[Walther_PPK#Overview|Walther PPK 7.65]], which was the official pistol of one of the secret service officers, as well as a rubber dinghy, were found. Celle prison is situated close to the bank of river [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]]. After the detonation, Mr. Debus' conditions of detention were aggravated "for security reasons". The secret service had planted escape tools into Debus' cell, which were found in the search after the attack, and was supposed to prove Debus' participation. Hence, the detainee started a hunger strike as a protest against this. Sigurd Debus died on April 16, 1981 shortly before the date of his  discharge from prison.

'''Certified wood''' and paper products come from responsibly managed forests – as defined by a particular standard. With third-party forest certification, an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 Metafore Forest Certification Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
'''Forest certification''' programs typically require that forest management practices conform to existing laws. Other basic requirements or characteristics of forest certification programs include:

Basic requirements of credible forest certification programs include:
* Protection of biodiversity, species at risk and wildlife habitat; sustainable harvest levels; protection of water quality; and prompt regeneration (e.g., replanting and reforestation).
* Third-party certification audits performed by accredited certification bodies.
* Publicly available certification audit summaries.
* Multi-stakeholder involvement in a standards development process.
* Complaints and appeals process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stateforesters.org/files/2008.Forest%20Certification.pdf National Association of State Foresters Policy Statement 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Today there are more than 50 certification programs worldwide &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Sustainable_Forests/Third_Party_Forest_Certification.pdf Third-Party Forest Certification in British Columbia]&lt;/ref&gt; addressing the many types of forests and tenures around the world. The two largest international forest certification programs are the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) and the [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] (PEFC).

The PEFC is the largest certification framework in terms of forest area, with approximately two-thirds of the total certified area. The FSC program is the fastest growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 115] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-party forest certification was pioneered in the early 1990s by the FSC, a collaboration between [[Environmental organizations|environmental]] [[Non-governmental organizations|NGOs]], forest product companies and social interests. Competing systems quickly emerged throughout the world. Some commentators, including [[Jared Diamond]], have suggested that many competing standards were set up by logging companies specifically aiming to confuse consumers with less rigorously enforced but similarly named competing standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== United States and Canada ===

In the United States and Canada, there are a number of forest certification programs. Three of these programs are endorsed by the PEFC. They are the [[American Tree Farm System]] (ATFS), the [[Canadian Standards Association]]’s [[Sustainable Forest Management Standard]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa-international.org/product_areas/forest_products_marking/ CSA International Forest Products Marking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019030053/http://www.csa-international.org/product_areas/forest_products_marking/ |date=2011-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sustainable Forestry Initiative]] (SFI) Program. ATFS is applicable only in the United States; the Canadian Standards Association SFM Standard is applicable only in Canada. SFI is applicable to both the United States and Canada. The FSC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsccanada.org/forestmanagementstd.htm Forest Stewardship Council Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fscus.org FSC United States]&lt;/ref&gt; program is applied throughout North America. SFI is the world’s largest regional forest certification program in terms of total certified forest area[1].

The [[National Association of State Foresters]] in the USA passed a resolution in 2008 that supports ''all'' of the forest certification systems used in the USA and recognized the value of their differences: “... the ATFS, FSC, and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability.... No certification program can credibly claim to be ‘best’, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility. Forest ecosystems are complex and a simplistic ‘one size fits all’ approach to certification cannot address all sustainability needs.”.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;[http://stateforesters.org/files/2008.Forest%20Certification.pdf Forest Certification as it Contributes to Sustainable Forestry]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Council of Forest Ministers]] issued a statement in 2008 on forest certification standards in Canada, which said: “In Canada, each jurisdiction’s forest laws, policies and administrative requirements comprise an {{sic|hide=y|over-|arching}} framework that fully characterizes what sustainable forest management (SFM) means in that jurisdiction, and what actions may take place on public and/or private forest land. Governments in Canada support third-party forest certification as a tool to demonstrate the rigor of Canada’s forest management laws, and to document the country’s world-class sustainable forest management record. The forest management standards of the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the FSC and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) are all used in Canada. Governments in Canada accept that these standards demonstrate, and promote the sustainability of forest management practices in Canada.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccfm.org/pdf/CCFM_Statement_FRandEN.pdf#page=2 Canadian Council of Forest Ministers Statement on Forest Certification Standards in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chain-of-custody certification==

Chain of Custody certification tracks the certified material through the production process – from the forest to the consumer, including all successive stages of processing, transformation, manufacturing and distribution. It also provides evidence that certified material in a certified product originates from certified forests.

The United Nations reports that between January 2009 and May 2010, the total number of PEFC and FSC chain-of-custody certificates issued worldwide increased by 88% for a total of 23,717 certificates (this does not include SFI certificates).&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 118] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future expansion==

Forest certification is a voluntary process. About 10% of the world’s forest under at least one certification program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 113] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers that choose to buy certified products are supporting land managers, land owners and forest product companies that have made a commitment to meeting the standards of forest certification.

Third-party forest certification is a useful tool for those seeking to purchase paper and wood products that come from forests that are well-managed and use materials that are legally harvested. Incorporating third-party certification into forest product buying practices can be a centerpiece for responsible wood and paper purchasing policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values, thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 Metafore]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009-2010 United Nations Market Review reported that companies that produced or traded in certified forest products often had a market advantage during the 2008-2009 recession because, in a buyers’ market, buyers could be more selective in choosing their sources of supply. The report cites four demand drivers for certification:&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 114] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paper, publishing, printing and packaging – commitments to increase the use of responsible paper sources by large publishers such as Time Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeinc.com/community/sustainability.php Time Inc. Sustainability Report 2009-2010 page 10]&lt;/ref&gt; has probably been the most significant factor driving growth in forest and chain-of-custody certification.
* Green public procurement – governments such as the UK and the Netherlands have adopted green timber procurement policies, including recognition of FSC and PEFC endorsed programs. An example is the UK’s Central Point of Expertise on Timber (set up by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and operated by ProForest).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpet.org.uk/evidence-of-compliance/category-a-evidence/introduction Central Point of Expertise on Timber]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Green building – standards for green building incentivize and reward the use of certified wood products.
*Illegal logging – new legislation designed to minimize the risk of illegal wood entering supply chains such as the amended Lacey Act in the United States has created a strong incentive to demand independently certified wood that can address illegal logging concerns.

The World Resources Institute, in partnership with the Environmental Investigation Agency, released a fact sheet designed to answer some of the frequently asked questions about the Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to ban commerce in illegally sourced plants and their products—including timber, wood, and paper products. The fact sheet says forest certification is a very good approach for demonstrating due care by showing government and customers that a company has taken proactive steps to eliminate illegal wood or plant material from its supply chain. Certification does not relieve importers of the requirement to submit appropriate import declaration information to U.S. government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/stories/2009/12/fact-sheet-are-you-ready-lacey-act World Resources Institute fact sheet Are You Ready for the Lacey Act?]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{mergefrom|Characterisation (law)|discuss=Talk:Choice of Law#Merger proposal|date=April 2018}}

'''Choice of law''' is a procedural stage in the litigation of a case involving the [[conflict of laws]] when it is necessary to reconcile the differences between the laws of different legal [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, such as [[sovereign state]]s, [[federated states]] (as in the US), or [[province]]s. The outcome of this process is potentially to require the courts of one [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]] to apply the law of a different jurisdiction in [[lawsuits]] arising from, say, [[family law]], [[tort]] or [[contract]]. The law which is applied is sometimes referred to as the "[[proper law]]." [[Dépeçage]] is an issue within choice of law.

==Sequence of events in conflict cases==
#Jurisdiction. The court selected by the [[plaintiff]] must decide both whether it has the jurisdiction to hear the case and, if it has, whether another forum is more suitable (the ''[[forum non conveniens]]'' issue relates to the problem of [[forum shopping]]) for the disposition of the case. Naturally, a plaintiff with appropriate knowledge and finance will always commence proceedings in the court most likely to give a favourable outcome. This is called forum shopping and whether a court will accept such cases is always determined by the local law.
#[[Enforcement of foreign judgments|Recognition of foreign judgments]]. Even where a conflict of laws exists, the court will recognize the validity of a foreign judgment in most cases. Under U.S. law, this authority is part of the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution. Under international law, this authority is part of the doctrine of [[comity]]. The court will invoke comity by its discretion and will usually look to two factors before using its discretionary powers: did the foreign court have jurisdiction, and were fair procedures used in adjudicating the case? Under English law, it is the doctrine of [[obligation]]. Within the European Union the [[Brussels I Regulation|Brussels Recast Regulation]] determines jurisdiction and recognition.
#[[Characterisation (conflict)|Characterization]]. The court then allocates each aspect of the case as pleaded to its appropriate legal classification. Each such classification has its own choice of law rules but distinguishing between [[procedure (conflict)|procedural]] and substantive rules requires care. The court may have adopted a rule of law which prevents it from applying any procedural law other than its own. This can include the court's own choice of law rules. A danger exists if the choice of law requires that a case be heard elsewhere due to the forum's lack of expertise in deciding an issue of foreign law.
#The [[court]] then applies the relevant choice of law rules. In a few cases, usually involving family law, an [[incidental question]] can arise which will complicate this process. The United States has adopted a law that almost universally eliminates incidental questions involving family law.  The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) requires states to apply the law of the "home state;" that is, the forum which originally determined custody and maintenance. A state court will only apply its own law when no parent retains a connection with the original jurisdiction and when substantial evidence is available in its forum to make a custody or maintenance determination.

==Choice-of-law stage==
The "traditional approach" looks to territorial factors, e.g. the [[domicile (law)|domicile]] or [[nationality]] of the parties, where the components comprising each cause of action occurred, where any relevant assets, whether movable or immovable, are located, etc., and chooses the law or laws that have the greatest connection to the cause(s) of action.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Even though this is a very flexible system, there has been some reluctance to apply it and various "escape devices" have developed, which allow courts to apply their local laws (the ''[[lex fori]]'') even though the disputed events took place in a different jurisdiction. The parties themselves may plead the case either to avoid invoking a foreign law or agree to the choice of law, assuming that the judge will not of his or her own motion go behind the pleadings. Their motive will be pragmatic. Full-scale conflict cases take longer and cost more to litigate. However, the courts in some states{{vague|date=May 2017}} are predisposed to prefer the ''lex fori'' wherever possible.{{cn|date=May 2017}} This may reflect the belief that the interests of justice will be better served if the judges apply the law with which they are most familiar, or it may reflect a more general parochialism in systems not accustomed to considering extraterritorial principles of law. One of the most common judicial strategies is to skew the characterization process.{{cn|date=May 2017}} By determining that a claim is one involving a contract instead of tort, or a question of family law instead of a testamentary issue, the Court can change the choice of law rules. For example, if an employee is hired by an employer in State A, is injured due to the employer's negligence in State B, and files a lawsuit to recover for the injury in State A, the court in State A might look to the employment contract to see if it contained a clause that governed the employer's duty of care with respect to the employee. If so, the court may be able characterize the claim as a breach of the contract, instead of a tort, and apply the law of the State A either because it was the place where the contract was made (the ''[[lex loci contractus]]'') or, if it were the place where the wage or salary was to be paid, where the contract was intended to be performed (the ''[[lex loci solutionis]]'').{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In this context, since the 1960s, the courts in the United States began developing a number of new approaches, as well as new escape devices.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This reflects the number of different laws that might be relevant in any given case before an American court. There is significant interstate trade and social mobility, and with the laws of each state of the Union representing a possible opportunity for conflict, it was necessary to produce a coherent system that could be applied in the courts of all fifty states.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Renvoi===
To limit the damage that would result from forum shopping, it is desirable that the same law is applied to achieve the same result no matter where the case is litigated. The system of [[renvoi]], which literally means "send back", is an attempt to achieve that end.

==Traditional approach==
The traditional approach is based on the idea that the territorial [[sovereignty]] of states must be respected. For example, when an event happens in a state that gives rise to a lawsuit - if two parties are involved in an automobile accident, for example - that state in which the accident occurred provides the parties with certain "vested rights". These rights include such things as the ability of a plaintiff to file a lawsuit, the imposition of a [[statute of limitations]] to prevent a [[defendant]] from being subjected to a lawsuit after too much time has passed, limitations on recovery, and specified burdens of evidence. These so-called ''vested rights'' compete with the policy claims of other states for their laws to be applied. What follows is a generalised summary of the rules. The approach in the U.S. is rather different (see [[Conflict of laws in the United States]]).

===Status===
[[Status (law)|Status]] is relevant for a wide array of issues. Self-evidently, unless the proposed litigant has legal personality, there will be no jurisdiction. It will also be relevant to [[immigration]], entitlement to social security and similar benefits, family law, contract, etc. The choice of law rule, the law of the [[domicile (law)|domicile]] (''[[lex domicilii]]'') if the forum is [[common law]] or law of [[nationality]] (''[[lex patriae]]'') or [[habitual residence]] if the forum is [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], applies to determine all question of status and its legal attributes. The ''lex fori'' determines the domicile, nationality or habitual residence, and applies that law to establish an [[in rem]] set of rights and [[capacity (law)|capacities]]. Thus, under some laws, the status of [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] affects the rights of inheritance in the case of an intestacy, etc. As to [[corporations]], the choice of law rule is the law of [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]] (the ''[[lex incorporationis]]'') for all matters of capacity, validity, shareholders' rights, etc.

===Contracts===
{{main|Conflict of contract laws}}
The choice of law rules for contracts are more complicated than the law affecting other obligations because they depend on the express or implied intentions of the parties and their personal circumstances. For example, questions as to whether a contract is valid may depend on the capacity of the parties to enter into a contract. This could be decided by reference to the ''lex domicilii'', ''lex patriae'' or habitual residence of the parties, or for policy reasons, by reference to the ''lex loci contractus'' (where the contract was made). But, if the contract was made electronically, where the contract was actually made must first be decided either by the ''lex fori'' or the putative proper law depending on the forum rules. There may also be problems if the parties selected the place where the contract was made in the hope of [[evasion (law)|evading]] the operation of some mandatory provisions in another relevant law.

On the other hand, deciding matters relating to ''performance'' will usually depend on the ''lex loci solutionis''. Another unique characteristic of contracts is that the parties can decide which law should apply for most purposes, and memorialize that decision into the contract itself (see [[forum selection clause]] and [[choice of law clause]]){{spaced ndash}}although not every jurisdiction will enforce such provisions. For the [[Harmonisation of law|harmonising]] provisions on contractual obligations in [[EU law]], see the [[Rome Convention (contract)]].

The [[Rome I Regulation]] constrains the choice of law for special types of contracts. With a view to the weaker parties, such as consumers, employees and insurants, special choice of law rules are laid down by articles 5-8. The most important rules for companies, mostly closing contracts with consumers, are listed in Art. 6. Art. 6 (I) defines the consumer contract as a contract where the consumer acts as a private person whereas the businessman acts for his commercial purpose. This articles also says that in absence of an explicit choice of law, a protected consumer contract is governed by the law of the consumer's habitual residence. In Art. 6 (II) the involved parties are given the possibility of a free choice of law. But the choice of law is legally void, if the consumer protection is limited by this choice.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Harald; Magnus, Ulrich; Winkler von Mohrenfels, Peter: ''IPR und Rechtsvergleichung'' §5 No.15-16. C.H. Beck, München 2004, {{ISBN|3-406-50945-2}}. {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tort===
{{main|Conflict of tort laws}}
The presumptive rule for tort is that the ''[[proper law]]'' applies. This is the law that has the greatest relevance to the issues involved. In public policy terms, this is likely to be the law of the place where the key elements of the "wrong" were performed or occurred (the ''[[lex loci delicti commissi]]''). As established in the case of &lt;ref&gt;Boys v Chaplin&lt;/ref&gt;[1969], both plaintiff and defendants were British Soldiers Residents Stationed in Malta. Having an accident in Malta the court looked at the Lex Loci relating to its dual action-ability.

===Family law===
{{main|Conflict of marriage laws|Conflict of nullity laws|Conflict of divorce laws}}
As to [[marriage]], both formal and common law, the general rule is the ''[[lex loci celebrationis]]'' determines its validity, i.e. the law of the place where the marriage is celebrated, unless the purpose of the marriage offends a public policy of the domicile/nationality/habitual residence state. Hence, some states limit the capacity of their citizens to celebrate a [[monogamy|monogamous]] marriage to a person of the opposite biological sex, or prohibit marriage between degrees of [[consanguinity]], etc. Questions of [[annulment|nullity]] and [[divorce]] straddle Family Law and status because the outcome of the judicial proceedings affects status and capacities, and also overlap with the more general question of when the courts of one state will recognize and enforce the judgments of another state.

===Property===
{{main|Conflict of property laws}}
The rule for immovable property (called real property in common law states) is that the ''[[lex situs]]'' applies to all questions of title. Movable property (called personalty in common law states) claims are governed by the law of the state in which the property is located at the time the rights are supposedly created. An important distinction, however, must be made for a contract which has some incidental effect on property, both immovable and movable, such as a loan with property pledged as a collateral. If the property is incidental to the contract, then the contract is evaluated under traditional choice of law principles for a contract. If, however, the primary purpose of the contract is to transfer the property, then the entire contract will be evaluated under the law of the state where the property is located.

===Trusts and succession===
{{main|Conflict of laws of trusts|Conflict of succession laws}}
Where an [[inter vivos]] or testamentary trust includes immovables, reference must be made to the ''lex situs'' on all aspects relating to title and land use. Similarly, title to movables including [[Chose (English law)|choses in action]], should be determined by ''lex situs'', i.e. the law of place where each item is located at the time the trust is created. Once created, all questions of administration are governed by the law specified in the trust instrument. In the unlikely event that the instrument is silent, the trust would be governed by the proper law.

All questions of prenuptial trusts and transfers are determined by the law of the transferor's domicile, nationality or habitual residence at the time of the marriage.

All questions relating to wills (and, as an incidental question, any testamentary trusts which the will purports to create), are governed by the law of domicile, nationality or habitual residence at the time of death. Questions of title affecting immovables are determined under the ''lex situs''.

Illustration: Mr. "Z" died in US leaving immovable properties in US and other immovable properties in Kilimanjaro Tanzania. "lex situs" the law applicable would be of the place where the immovable is located. that is to say those in US to be administered according to the US laws and those in Tanzania according to the laws of Tanzania.(2013)

The technique was first used after [[U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Kennedy assassination|assassination]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt;  From the early 1980s through 2004 the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] conducted about 2,500 analyses on cases submitted by law-enforcement groups.  The results of these analyses had often been questioned by defence lawyers and the press, so the FBI finally asked the [[United States National Academy of Science]]'s [[Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy]] to research the scientific merit of the process.

In 2004 the Board's study was summarized in "Forensic Analysis: Weighing Bullet Lead Evidence."  The Board determined that the chemical analyses were being performed correctly and were probably sufficient to determine correlation between two bullets from separate sources (the analysis used [[Atomic emission spectroscopy|plasma-optical emission spectroscopy]] to identify trace elements in the bullets).  The report also concluded that the seven trace elements selected for the analyses (arsenic, antimony, tin, copper, bismuth, silver and cadmium) are acceptable for sample correlation.  The report finally concluded that the procedure is the best available method for such correlations.  The greatest [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]] in the report was that the [[Statistics|statistical]] tests as applied by the FBI could cause confusion and misinterpretation when transmitted to prosecutors or when explained to a trial jury.  Because of the significance of this weakness, the report concluded that the analysis should be used with caution.  This report helped the FBI decide in 2004 to voluntarily cease offering the analysis to law-enforcement entities. The National Academy of Sciences never required that the FBI stop using the test.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt;

''CNN PRESENTS Encore Presentation: Reasonable Doubt'' examined the unreliability of this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=CNN PRESENTS-Encore Presentation: ''Reasonable Doubt''| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/07/cp.01.html | publisher=CNN | date=Aired May 7, 2006| accessdate=May 31, 2013| format=transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been discontinued as of September 1, 2005.&lt;ref name="FBI Press Release"&gt;{{cite press release| title=FBI Laboratory Announces Discontinuation of Bullet Lead Examinations| url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-laboratory-announces-discontinuation-of-bullet-lead-examinations| publisher=FBI National Press Office| date=September 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. government]] has fought releasing the list of the estimated 2,500 cases over three decades in which it performed the analysis, which may have led to [[false conviction]]s. According to the FBI, only 20% of the 2,500 tests performed introduced the CBLA results into evidence at trial.&lt;ref name="FBI Press Release" /&gt;

On 17 December 2008, Jimmy Ates was released from a Florida prison after serving ten years on the conviction of having murdered his wife, a conviction obtained largely on the strength of a bullet-lead analysis.  His conviction was overturned as a consequence of the 2004 report.&lt;ref name=Bohaty&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bohaty| first=Rochelle F.

The '''Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009''' is a [[U.S. federal law|federal statute]] passed by the [[United States Congress]] and signed by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] on May 22, 2009. It is comprehensive credit card reform legislation that aims "...to establish fair and transparent practices relating to the extension of credit under an open end consumer credit plan, and for other purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr627/text|title=Text of H.R. 627 (111th)|publisher=Govtrack.us|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed with [[bipartisan]] support by both the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

==Introduction and votes==
The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights was introduced in the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] as {{USBill|110|H.R.|5244}} in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by Representative [[Carolyn Maloney]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] and the chair of the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Financial Services Committee]]'s [[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit|Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit]]. The bill had passed 312 to 112 but was never given a vote in the Senate.

In the [[111th United States Congress]], the bill was reintroduced as {{USBill|111|H.R.|627}} and on April 30, 2009, the House passed 357 yes votes to 70 no votes. The Senate followed suit and passed an amended version on May 19 with 90 yes votes and 5 no votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=s2009-194 |title=H.R. 627 (111th): Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (On Passage of the Bill) |publisher=GovTrack.us |date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Should note that one of the amendments was an unrelated measure to allow guns in National Parks (see section below).--&gt; The House passed the amended bill the next day by a vote of 279 to 147 and it was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on May 22, 2009.

The bill went into effect on February 22, 2010, nine months after it was enacted.

==Provisions==
The Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights includes several provisions aimed at limiting how credit card companies can charge consumers but does not include [[price control]]s, rate caps, or fee settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR00627:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; Public Law Summary by Congressional Research Service], THOMAS, Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

Key provisions include:
* '''Giving consumers enough time to pay their bills.''' Credit card companies have to give consumers at least 21 days to pay from the time the bill is mailed. Credit card companies can not "trap" consumers by setting payment deadlines on the weekend or in the middle of the day, or changing their payment deadlines each month. Creditors may not charge late fees if debtor shows proof of payment by close of business on the due date. If the established due date falls upon a Saturday, Sunday, or legal banking holiday, the due date is pushed back to the next business day.
* '''No retroactive rate increases.''' Credit card companies must give consumers at least 45 days notice if their rates are about to go up, and can not change any terms of the contract within a year.  Low introductory rates must last at least six months.
* '''Easier to pay down debt.''' Credit card companies must apply payments to a consumer's highest interest rate balances first. Statements must show consumers how long it would take to pay off their existing balance if the consumer made only the minimum payment, and must show the payment amount and total interest cost to pay off the entire balance in 36 months.
* '''Eliminates "fee harvester cards."''' The act restricts fees on low-balance cards sold to cardholders with bad credit. For many of these cards, the up-front fees charged exceeded the remaining credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/march-2009/money/scams/a-credit-card-for-anyone/scams-a-credit-card-for-anyone.htm|title=Consumer Reports Magazine|website=www.consumerreports.org|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act also restricts the fees that can be charged for gift cards and other prepaid cards. 
* '''Eliminates excessive marketing to young people.''' Consumers under the age of 21 must prove that they have an independent income or get a co-signer before applying for a credit card.  The Act also prevents credit card companies from mailing offers to consumers under 21 unless they "opt in," and prohibits companies from wooing students with T-shirts, free pizza and other free gifts at university-sponsored events.&lt;ref&gt;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/fact-sheet-reforms-protect-american-credit-card-holders&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amendment on guns in national parks===
[[Gun politics in the United States|Gun rights]] advocates in the Senate, led by [[Tom Coburn]] (R-Okla) added an [[Rider (legislation)|unrelated rider]] to the bill to prevent the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] from enforcing any regulation that would prohibit an individual from possessing a firearm in any unit of the [[National Park System]] or the [[National Wildlife Refuge System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-627&amp;version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:582|title=Text of H.R. 627 (111th): Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (Passed Congress version) - GovTrack.us|website=GovTrack.us|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SP01067:|title=Amendment SA 1067 proposed by Senator Coburn to Amendment SA 1058 of HR 627|publisher=|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate passed the amendment 67-29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://washingtonindependent.com/42641/senate-approves-coburn-gun-amendment |title=Senate Approves Coburn Gun Amendment…in Credit Card Bill |last=Lillis |first=Mike |date=May 12, 2009 |work=The Washington Independent |accessdate=June 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621182431/http://washingtonindependent.com/42641/senate-approves-coburn-gun-amendment |archivedate=June 21, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTguns"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/us/politics/21cards.html|title=Bill Changing Credit Card Rules Is Sent to Obama With Gun Measure Included|first=Carl|last=Hulse|date=May 20, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=April 8, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This amendment overturns a Reagan-era policy prohibiting firearms from being carried in national parks. The [[George W. Bush]] administration had attempted to implement a similar policy through the rulemaking process just before leaving office, but the change was struck down by a federal judge. The provision has been heavily criticized by some environmentalists and [[gun control]] advocates, but it was heavily applauded by [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] groups.&lt;ref name="NYTguns"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/sciencemedicine/story/C3C0BD3CE784C5E3862576D000099E0D?OpenDocument | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224061605/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/sciencemedicine/story/C3C0BD3CE784C5E3862576D000099E0D?OpenDocument | title=Law change allows guns at U.S. parks, wildlife areas | archivedate=February 24, 2010 |last=McGuire|first=Kim|date=February 20, 2010|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
[[File:Elizabeth Warren keynote speech Feb 22 2011 on CARD Act.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Elizabeth Warren]] delivers the keynote speech entitled "The CARD Act: One Year Later" at an evaluation symposium held February 22, 2011]]
The act was not expected to affect existing credit card contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/krwg/news/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1504604&amp;sectionID=1|title=Bingaman backs Credit Card Reform|date=May 11, 2009|publisher=KRWG|accessdate=October 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the act that was passed applies to contracts made in the past by setting an effective date of February 22, 2010, which gave banks time to prepare and notify their customers. The [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] in its October 2013 report on the CARD Act found that between  the first quarter of 2009 and December 2013,  credit card interest rates increased on average from 16.2%  to 18.5%,  while the “total cost of credit,” that is, the total of all fees and interest paid by all consumers as a percentage of the average cycle-ending balance, decreased by two hundred basis points (2.00%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201309_cfpb_card-act-report.pdf|title=CARD Act Report|date=October 1, 2013|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CFPB made no judgment on the extent to which the CARD Act contributed to these increases and decreases. However, interest rates on other types of consumer credit increased. The CFPB in its study also found that consumers paid less in late payment and over-the-limit fees since passage of the CARD Act. In contrast, studies by [[CardHub.com]]&lt;ref name="Card Act Study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.cardhub.com/interest-rate-study-q1-2011/|title=Study: The CARD Act's Impact on Rising Interest Rates|publisher=CardHub.com|accessdate=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Center for Responsible Lending]]&lt;ref name="Responsible Lending"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.responsiblelending.org/credit-cards/research-analysis/FinalCRL-CARD-Clarity-Report2-16-11.pdf|title=Credit Card Clarity: CARD Act Reform Works|publisher=Center for Responsible Lending|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that interest rate trends were the result of economic pressures typical of a recession and not the law.  According to these studies, historical economic data shows that the interest rate increase and decline in available credit seen during the Great Recession should have been worse considering the widespread unemployment, credit card delinquency and credit card charge-offs.&lt;ref name="Card Act Study" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Responsible Lending" /&gt;

Section 502(a) of the CARD Act requires a review of the consumer credit card market to be undertaken every two years. In February 2013 letter to the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] as part of the review, the [[American Bankers Association]] wrote that "the CARD Act has provided clear and significant benefits to consumers" but "there have also been significant tradeoffs, specifically, higher costs and less availability for credit card credit."&lt;ref name="BankersLetter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aba.com/Advocacy/commentletters/Documents/clCardAct2013Feb.pdf|title=ABA Letter to CFPB re: Notice and request for information regarding the credit card market|date=February 19, 2013|accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Bankers Association, in its letter responding to the CFPB's request for information on the impact of the act, argued that following the implementation of the CARD Act and associated regulations, "average credit card interest rates have increased and credit card credit is less available, especially to subprime borrowers" and "credit card debt has decreased at a higher rate than other consumer debt and has decreased as a percent of disposable income as non‐revolving debt as a percent of disposable income has increased."&lt;ref name="BankersLetter"/&gt;

A study published in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' in 2014 (by Neale Mahoney of the [[University of Chicago]], Sumit Agarwal of the [[National University of Singapore]], Souphala Chomsisengphet of the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] and Johannes Stroebel of the [[New York University Stern School of Business]]) found that the law was saving American consumers $11.9 billion a year, and particularly decreased costs for borrowers with poor credit.  The researchers further found "no evidence of an increase in interest charges or a reduction to access to credit."&lt;ref&gt;Floyd Norris, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/business/economy/a-credit-card-rule-that-worked-for-consumers.html Card Act Cleared Up Credit Cards' Hidden Costs], ''New York Times'' (November 7, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sumit Agarwal, Souphala Chomsisengphet, Neale Mahoney &amp; Johannes Stroebel, [http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/11/24/qje.qju037 Regulating Consumer Financial Products: Evidence from Credit Cards], ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' (first published online November 25, 2014), [[doi: 10.1093/qje/qju037]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech on the one-year anniversary of the CARD Act, then-CFPB Special Adviser [[Elizabeth Warren]] said that "much of the [credit card] industry has gone further than the law requires in curbing re-pricing and overlimit fees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1074.aspx |work=Remarks by Elizabeth Warren on The CARD Act |title=The CARD Act: One Year Later |publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury |last=Warren |first=Elizabeth |date=February 22, 2011 |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she said there was still much work to be done, that the [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]'s "next challenges will be about further clarifying price and risks and making it easier for consumers to make direct product comparisons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/02/warren-praises-credit-card-industry-for-transparency-efforts-for-borrowers/ |title=Warren Praises Credit Card Industry for Transparency Efforts for Borrowers |last=Saenz |first=Arlette |date=February 22, 2011 |work=ABC News |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/22/financial-regulation-cards-idUSN2229340420110222 |title=Credit cards still in US watchdog Warren's sights |work=Reuters |date=February 22, 2011 |last1=Clarke |first1=Dave |last2=Aspan |first2=Maria |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/18/elizabeth-warren-shortcom_n_467295.html |title=Elizabeth Warren: Shortcomings Of Credit Card Reform Show Need For CFPA |last=Delaney |first=Arthur |work=Huffington Post |date=February 18, 2011 |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, many stay-at-home spouses complained that because they have no individual income, the act prevented them from acquiring credit cards without their husbands' permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/16/pf/credit-cards-stay-at-home-moms/ |title=Stay-at-home mom fights new credit card rule |last=Ellis|first=Blake |work=CNN Money |date=May 16, 2012 |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 29, 2013, the CFPB amended regulations to allow credit card issuers to consider third-party income for applicants who are 21 or older, if the applicant has a reasonable expectation of access to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/the-cfpb-amends-card-act-rule-to-make-it-easier-for-stay-at-home-spouses-and-partners-to-get-credit-cards/|title=The CFPB Amends Card Act Rule to Make it Easier for Stay-at-Home Spouses and Partners to Get Credit Cards|date=April 29, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Custom''' in [[law]] is the established pattern of behavior that can be objectively verified within a particular social setting. A claim can be carried out in defense of "what has always been done and accepted by law." Related is the idea of '''prescription'''; a right enjoyed through long custom rather than positive law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/prescription "Prescription"], The Free Dictionary by Farlex. Accessed: June 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Customary law''' (also, '''consuetudinary''' or '''unofficial law''') exists where:  
#a certain legal practice is observed and
#the relevant actors consider it to be law (''[[opinio juris]]'').

Most customary laws deal with ''standards of community'' that have been long-established in a given locale. However the term can also apply to areas of [[international law]] where certain standards have been nearly [[Universal jurisdiction|universal]] in their acceptance as correct bases of action &amp;ndash; in example, laws against [[piracy]] or [[slavery]] (see ''[[hostis humani generis]]''). In many, though not all instances, customary laws will have supportive court rulings and case law that has evolved over time to give additional weight to their rule as law and also to demonstrate the trajectory of evolution (if any) in the interpretation of such law by relevant courts.

==Nature, definition and sources of customary law==
A central issue regarding the recognition of custom is determining the appropriate methodology to know what practices and norms actually constitutes customary law. It is not immediately clear that classic Western theories of jurisprudence can be reconciled in any useful way with conceptual analyses of customary law, and thus some scholars (like John Comaroff and Simon Roberts)&lt;ref name=cr&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts.&lt;/ref&gt; have characterised customary law norms in their own terms.  Yet, there clearly remains some disagreement, which is seen in John Hund's critique of Comaroff and Roberts' theory, and preference for the contributions of [[H. L. A. Hart]]. Hund argues that Hart's [[H. L. A. Hart#The Concept of Law|''The Concept of Law'']] solves the conceptual problem with which scholars who have attempted to articulate how customary law principles may be identified, defined and how they operate in regulating social behaviour and resolving disputes.&lt;ref name=hund&gt;Hund.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Customary law as an indefinite repertoire of norms ===
Comaroff and Roberts' famous work, "Rules and Processes",&lt;ref name=cr/&gt; attempted to detail the body of norms that constitute [[Tswana people|Tswana]] law in a way that was less legalistic (or rule-oriented) than had Isaac Schapera. They defined "mekgwa le melao ya Setswana" in terms of Casalis and Ellenberger definition: ''melao'' therefore being rules pronounced by a chief and ''mekgwa'' as norms that become customary law through traditional usage.&lt;ref name=cr70&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 70&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, however, they noted that the Tswana seldom attempt to classify the vast array of existing norms into categories&lt;ref name=cr70/&gt; and they thus termed this the 'undifferentiated nature of the normative repertoire'. Moreover, they observe the co-existence of overtly incompatible norms that may breed conflict, either due to circumstances in a particular situation, or inherently due to their incongruous content.&lt;ref&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 73&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of rule classification and failure to eradicate internal inconsistencies between potentially conflicting norms allows for much flexibility in dispute settlement and is also viewed as a 'strategic resource' for disputants who seek to advance their own success in a case. The latter incongruities (especially of inconsistencies of norm content) are typically solved by elevating one of the norms (tacitly) from 'the literal to the symbolic'.&lt;ref&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 75&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for the accommodation of both as they now theoretically exist in different realms of reality. This is highly contextual, which further illustrates that norms cannot be viewed in isolation and are open to negotiation. Thus, although there are a small number of so-called non-negotiable norms, the vast majority are viewed and given substance contextually, which is seen as fundamental to the Tswana.

Comaroff and Roberts describe how outcomes of specific cases have the ability to change the normative repertoire, as the repertoire of norms is seen to be both in a state of formation and transformation at all times.&lt;ref&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 79&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are justified on the grounds that they are merely giving recognition to de facto observations of transformation [219]. Furthermore, the legitimacy of a chief is a direct determinant of the legitimacy of his decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 81&lt;/ref&gt; In the formulation of legislative pronouncements, as opposed to decisions made in dispute resolution,&lt;ref name=cr82&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 82&lt;/ref&gt; the chief first speaks of the proposed norm with his advisors, then council of headmen, then the public assembly debate the proposed law and may accept or reject it. A chief can proclaim the law even if the public assembly rejects it, but this is not often done; and, if the chief proclaims the legislation against the will of the public assembly, the legislation will become melao, however it is unlikely that it will be executed because its effectiveness depends on the chief's legitimacy and the norm's consistency with the practices (and changes in social relations) and will of the people under that chief.&lt;ref name=cr82/&gt;

Regarding the invocation of norms in disputes, Comaroff and Roberts used the term, "paradigm of argument", to refer to the linguistic and conceptual frame used by a disputant, whereby 'a coherent picture of relevant events and actions in terms of one or more implicit or explicit normative referents' is created.&lt;ref name=cr85&gt;Comaroff &amp; Roberts, 85&lt;/ref&gt; In their explanation, the complainant (who always speaks first) thus establishes a paradigm the defendant can either accept and therefore argue within that specific paradigm or reject and therefore introduce his or her own paradigm (usually, the facts are not contested here). If the defendant means to change the paradigm, they will refer to norms as such, where actually norms are not ordinarily explicitly referenced in Tswana dispute resolution as the audience would typically already know them and just the way one presents one's case and constructs the facts will establish one's paradigm. The headman or chief adjudicating may also do same: accept the normative basis implied by the parties (or one of them), and thus not refer to norms using explicit language but rather isolate a factual issue in the dispute and then make a decision on it without expressly referring to any norms, or impose a new or different paradigm onto the parties.&lt;ref name=cr85/&gt;

=== Law as necessarily rule-governed ===
Hund finds Comaroff and Roberts' flexibility thesis of a 'repertoire of norms' from which litigants and adjudicator choose in the process of negotiating solutions between them uncompelling.&lt;ref name=hund/&gt; He is therefore concerned with disproving what he calls [[Scepticism in law|"rule scepticism"]] on their part. He notes that the concept of custom generally denotes convergent behaviour, but not all customs have the force of law. Hund therefore draws from Hart's analysis distinguishing social rules, which have internal and external aspects, from habits, which have only external aspects. Internal aspects are the reflective attitude on the part of adherents toward certain behaviours perceived to be obligatory, according to a common standard. External aspects manifest in regular, observable behaviour, but is not obligatory. In Hart's analysis, then, social rules amount to custom that has legal force.

Hart identifies three further differences between habits and binding social rules.&lt;ref name=hund/&gt; First, a social rule exists where society frowns on deviation from the habit and attempts to prevent departures by criticising such behaviour. Second, when this criticism is seen socially as a good reason for adhering to the habit, and it is welcomed. And, third, when members of a group behave in a common way not only out of habit or because everyone else is doing it, but because it is seen to be a common standard that should be followed, at least by some members. Hund, however, acknowledges the difficulty of an outsider knowing the dimensions of these criteria that depend on an internal point of view.

For Hund, the first form of rule scepticism concerns the widely held opinion that, because the content of customary law derives from practice, there are actually no objective rules, since it is only behaviour that informs their construction. On this view, it is impossible to distinguish between behaviour that is rule bound and behaviour that is not—i.e., which behaviour is motivated by adherence to law (or at least done in recognition of the law) and is merely a response to other factors. Hund sees this as problematic because it makes quantifying the law almost impossible, since behaviour is obviously inconsistent. Hund argues that this is a misconception based on a failure to acknowledge the importance of the ''internal element''. In his view, by using the criteria described above, there is not this problem in deciphering what constitutes "law" in a particular community.&lt;ref name=hund/&gt;

According to Hund, the second form of rule scepticism says that, though a community may have rules, those rules are not arrived at [[Deductive reasoning|'deductively']], i.e. they are not created through legal/moral reasoning only but are instead driven by the personal/political motives of those who create them. The scope for such influence is created by the loose and undefined nature of customary law, which, Hund argues, grants customary-lawmakers (often through traditional 'judicial processes') a wide discretion in its application. Yet, Hund contends that the fact that rules might sometimes be arrived at in the more ad hoc way, does not mean that this defines the system. If one requires a perfect system, where laws are created only deductively, then one is left with a system with no rules. For Hund, this cannot be so and an explanation for these kinds of law-making processes is found in Hart's conception of "secondary rules" (rules in terms of which the main body of norms are recognised). Hund therefore says that for some cultures, for instance in some sections of [[Tswana people|Tswana]] society, the secondary rules have developed only to the point where laws are determined with reference to politics and personal preference. This does not mean that they are not "rules". Hund argues that if we acknowledge a developmental pattern in societies' constructions of these secondary rules then we can understand how this society constructs its laws and how it differs from societies that have come to rely on an objective, stand-alone body of rules.&lt;ref name=hund/&gt;

==Customary law and codification==
{{main|Codification (law)}}
The modern [[Codification (law)|codification]] of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] developed from the tradition of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[custumal]]s, collections of local customary law that developed in a specific manorial or borough jurisdiction, and which were slowly pieced together mainly from [[case law]] and later written down by local [[jurist]]s. Custumals acquired the force of law when they became the undisputed rule by which certain [[rights]], entitlements, and [[obligation]]s were regulated between members of a community.&lt;ref&gt;In ''R. v Secretary of State For Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs'', [1982] 2 All E.R. 118, [[Lord Denning]] said "These customary laws are not written down. They are handed down by tradition from one generation to another. Yet beyond doubt they are well established and have the force of law within the community."&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples include [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]]'s ''De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae'' for England, the ''[[Coutume de Paris]]'' for the city of Paris, the ''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'' for northern Germany, and the many ''[[fuero]]s'' of Spain.

==International law==
{{Main|Customary international law}}

In [[international law]], ''customary law'' refers to the ''Law of Nations'' or the legal norms that have developed through the customary exchanges between [[Sovereign state|states]] over time, whether based on [[diplomacy]] or aggression.  Essentially, legal obligations are believed to arise between states to carry out their affairs consistently with past accepted conduct.  These customs can also change based on the acceptance or rejection by states of particular acts.  Some principles of customary law have achieved the force of [[peremptory norm]]s, which cannot be violated or altered except by a norm of comparable strength.  These norms are said to gain their strength from universal acceptance, such as the prohibitions against [[genocide]] and [[slavery]]. Customary international law can be distinguished from [[treaty]] law, which consists of explicit agreements between nations to assume obligations.  However, many treaties are attempts to codify pre-existing customary law.

==Customary law within contemporary legal systems==

Customary law is a recognized source of law within jurisdictions of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition, where it may be subordinate to both [[statutes]] and [[regulations]]. In addressing custom as a source of law within the civil law tradition, [[John Henry Merryman]] notes that, though the attention it is given in scholarly works is great, its importance is "slight and decreasing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Civil Law Tradition: An Introduction to the Legal Systems of Europe and Latin America|first=John Henry|last=Merryman|edition=3rd|year=2007|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|page=24|isbn=978-0-8047-5569-6|lccn=2007003956|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6OJf9CbgKTkC&amp;pg=PA24|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in many countries around the world, one or more types of customary law continue to exist side by side with official law, a condition referred to as '''[[legal pluralism]]''' (see [[List of national legal systems]]).

In the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], [[custom (canon law)|custom]] is a source of law. [[Canonical jurisprudence]], however, differs from Civil law jurisprudence in requiring the express or implied consent of the legislator for a custom to obtain the force of law.

In the Common Law of [[England]], "Long usage" must be established.

It is a broad principle of property law that, if something has gone on for a long time without objection, whether it be using a right of way or occupying land to which one has no title, the law will eventually recognise the fact and give the person doing it the legal right to continue.

It is known in case law as
Customary Rights 
"Customary rights". Something which has been practised since time immemorial by reference to a particular locality may acquire the legal status of a custom, which is a form of local law.The legal criteria defining a custom are precise.  The most common claim in recent times, is for customary rights to moor a vessel.

The mooring must have been in continuous use for "Time Immemorial" which is  defined by legal precedent as 12 years (or 20 years for Crown Land) for the same purpose by people using them for that purpose.

To give two examples:- A custom of mooring which might have been established in past times for over two hundred years by the fishing fleet of local inhabitants of a coastal community will not simply transfer so as to benefit present day recreational boat owners who may hail from much further afield.

Whereas a group of houseboats on a mooring that has been in continuous use for the last 25 years 
with a mixture of owner occupiers and rented houseboats, may clearly continue to be used by houseboats, where the owners live in the same town or city.

Both the purpose of the moorings and the class of persons benefited by the custom must have been clear and consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ayb.ltd.uk/customary-mooring-rights/|title=Customary Mooring Rights|author=|work=|publisher=[[Associated Yacht Brokers]]|accessdate=19 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413152848/http://ayb.ltd.uk/customary-mooring-rights/|archivedate=13 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], customary aboriginal law has a constitutional foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html |title=Constitution Act, 1982, s. 35(1) |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=29 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320212057/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/Const/annex_e.html |archivedate=20 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for this reason has increasing influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Generic and Specific Aboriginal Rights|last=Slattery|first=Brian|authorlink=|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=6|pages=|url=http://www.law.uvic.ca/calder/Papers/Brian%20Slattery.pdf|accessdate=21 August 2008}} and {{cite book |title=Let Right Be Done: Aboriginal title, the Calder Case, and the Future of Indigenous Rights |last=Foster |first=Hamar |authorlink= |author2=Heather Raven and Jeremy Webber (eds.) |year=2007 |publisher=UBC Press |location=Vancouver |isbn= |volume=18 No. 7 (July, 2008) |page= |pages=574–578 |url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/foster0708.htm |accessdate=11 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830063039/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/foster0708.htm |archivedate=30 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Scandinavia]]n countries customary law continues to exist and has great influence. 

Customary law is also used in some [[Third World]] countries, such as those in [[Africa]], usually used alongside common or civil law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.droitcivil.uottawa.ca/world-legal-systems/eng-tableau.php#g |title=JuryGlobe |author= |work= |publisher=[[University of Ottawa]] |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Ethiopia]], despite the adoption of legal codes based on [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in the 1950s according to Dolores Donovan and Getachew Assefa there are more than 60 systems of customary law currently in force, "some of them operating quite independently of the formal state legal system." They offer two reasons for the relative autonomy of these customary law systems: one is that the Ethiopian government lacks sufficient resources to enforce its legal system to every corner of Ethiopia; the other is that the Ethiopian government has made a commitment to preserve these customary systems within its boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Dolores A. Donovan and Getachew Assefa, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3649118 "Homicide in Ethiopia: Human Rights, Federalism, and Legal Pluralism," ''American Journal of Comparative Law''], '''51''' (2003), p. 505&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[President of Kyrgyzstan]] [[Askar Akaev]] announced a decree to revitalize the ''[[aqsaqal]]'' courts of village elders. The courts would have jurisdiction over property, torts and family law.&lt;ref name="Beyer"&gt;Judith Beyer, Kyrgyz Aksakal Courts: Pluralistic Accounts of History, 53 J. OF L. PLURALISM 144 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''aqsaqal'' courts were eventually included under Article 92 of the Kyrgyz constitution. As of 2006, there were approximately 1,000 ''aqsaqal'' courts throughout Kyrgyzstan, including in the capital of [[Bishkek]].&lt;ref name="Beyer" /&gt; Akaev linked the development of these courts to the rekindling of Kyrgyz national identity. In a 2005 speech, he connected the courts back to the country's nomadic past and extolled how the courts expressed the Kyrgyz ability of self-governance.&lt;ref&gt;Former President Akaev, quoted in Beyer, ''Kyrgyz Aksakal Courts''&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ''aqsaqal'' courts exist, with varying levels of legal formality, in other countries of [[Central Asia]].

The [[Somali people]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] follow a customary law system referred to as [[Xeer]]. It survives to a significant degree everywhere in Somalia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/story/2701 |title=The Rule of Law without the State |author=Spencer Heath MacCallum |date=12 September 2007 |work= |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Somali communities in the [[Ogaden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chfhq.org/files/3707_file_Somali_Region_Assessment_8.4.06.pdf |title=Grassroots Conflict Assessment Of the Somali Region, Ethiopia |author= |date=August 2006 |work= |publisher=CHF International |accessdate=11 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726084227/http://www.chfhq.org/files/3707_file_Somali_Region_Assessment_8.4.06.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist Peter Leeson attributes the increase in economic activity since the fall of the [[Siad Barre]] administration to the security in life, liberty and property provided by Xeer in large parts of [[Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterleeson.com/Better_Off_Stateless.pdf |title=Better off stateless |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch attorney Michael van Notten also draws upon his experience as a legal expert in his comprehensive study on Xeer, ''The Law of the Somalis: A Stable Foundation for Economic Development in the Horn of Africa'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Van Notten, Michael. 2005. ''The Law of the Somalis: A Stable Foundation for Economic and Social Development in the Horn of Africa'', Trenton NJ: Red Sea Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India many customs are accepted by law. For example, [[Hinduism|Hindu]] marriage ceremonies are recognized by the [[Hindu Marriage Act]].

In Indonesia, customary [[adat]] laws of the country's various indigenous ethnicities are recognized, and customary dispute resolution is recognized in [[Papua (province)|Papua]]. Indonesian adat law are mainly divided into 19 circles, namely [[Aceh]], [[Gayo Lues Regency|Gayo]], [[Alas people|Alas]], and [[Batak]], [[Minangkabau Highlands|Minangkabau]], [[South Sumatra]], the [[Malay Indonesian|Malay]] regions, [[Bangka Island|Bangka]] and [[Belitung]], [[Kalimantan]], [[Minahasa]], [[Gorontalo]], [[Toraja]], [[South Sulawesi]], [[Ternate]], the [[Molluccas]], [[Papua (province)|Papua]], [[Timor]], [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]], Central and East [[Java]] including the island of [[Madura]], [[Sunda Islands|Sunda]], and the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] monarchies, including the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], [[Surakarta Sunanate]], and the [[Pakualaman]] and [[Mangkunegaran]] princely states.

==Custom in torts==
{{Confusing|section|date=November 2008}}

Custom is used in [[tort]] law to help determine [[negligence]].  Following or disregarding a custom is not determinative of negligence, but instead is an indication of possible best practices or alternatives to a particular action.

== Methodology ==

===Sources===
Information about divorces can generally be obtained from the census data published by governmental statistics offices.

===Indicators===

====Crude divorce rate====
One measure of [[divorce]]s is the ''crude divorce rate'', which is the number of divorces per 1,000 [[population]].&lt;ref name = "england"/&gt; It can give a general overview of [[marriage]] in an area, but it does not take people who cannot marry into account. For example, it would include young children who are clearly not of marriageable age in its sample. A related measure is the ''refined divorce rate'' which measures the number of divorces per 1,000 women married to men, so that non-married persons, e.g. young children are left out of the rate.&lt;ref name = "england"/&gt;
Crude Divorce Rate= Div/Pop*1000

====Divorce to marriage ratio====
Another measure of divorces is the ''divorce to marriage ratio'', which is the number of divorces to the number of marriages in a given year (the ratio of the crude divorce rate to the crude marriage rate).&lt;ref name = "england"&gt;{{citation | doi = 10.2307/351029 | last1 = England | first1 = J. Lynn | last2 = Kunz | first2 = Phillip R. | title = The Application of Age-Specific Rates to Divorce | journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 37 | issue = 1 |date = February 1975| pages = 40–46 | publisher = Journal of Marriage and Family, Vol. 37, No. 1 | jstor = 351029}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if there are 550 divorces and 1,000 marriages in a given year in a given area, the ratio would be one divorce for every two marriages, e.g. a ratio of 0.55 (55%). However, this measurement compares two unlike populations, those who can marry and those who can divorce.

Say there exists a community with 100,000 married couples, and very few people capable of marriage, for reasons such as age. If 1,000 people obtain divorces and 1,000 people get married in the same year, the ratio is one divorce for every marriage, which may lead people to think that the community's relationships are extremely unstable, despite the number of married people not changing. This is also true in reverse: a community with very many people of marriageable age may have 10,000 marriages and 1,000 divorces, leading people to believe that it has very stable relationships.

Furthermore, these two rates are not directly comparable since the marriage rate only examines the current year, while the divorce rate examines the outcomes of marriages for many previous years.  This does not equate to the proportion of marriages in a given single-year cohort that will ultimately end in divorce.

====Longitudinal study====
Another solution is to conduct a longitudinal study of married batches to assess the divorce rate.

The '''Donoughmore Constitution''' ({{lang-si|ඩොනමෝර් ආණ්ඩුක්‍රම ව්‍යවස්ථාව|translit=Ḍonamōr Āṇḍukrama Vyavasthāva}}; {{lang-ta|டொனமூர் அரசியலமைப்பு|translit=Ṭoṉamūr Araciyalamaippu}}), created by the [[Donoughmore Commission]], served [[Sri Lanka]] (Ceylon) from 1931 to 1947 when it was replaced by the [[Soulbury Constitution]].

It was a significant development. First, it was the only constitution in the [[British Empire]] (outside the "white" dominions of [[Australia]], [[South Africa]] and [[Canada]]) enabling [[general election]]s with adult [[universal suffrage]]. For the first time, a "dependent", non-caucasian country within the empires of [[Western Europe]] was given one-person, one-vote and the power to control domestic affairs. Here was the pilot project whose success would ensure freedom from colonial/imperial bondage for whole swathes of [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and the [[Caribbean]].

Secondly, it created a committee system of government specifically to address the multi-ethnic problems of Sri Lanka. Under this system, no one ethnic community could dominate the political arena. Instead, every government department was overseen by a committee of parliamentarians drawn from all the ethnic communities. This created a built-in series of checks and balances, leading to continual '[[pork barrel|pork-barrelling]]' and 'log-rolling', in which every ethnic group gained something. Consensual politics was thereby forced on Sri Lanka's reluctant political activists. Power and funding followed those with the ability to maximise broadbased multi-ethnic support: negotiators and peacemakers were therefore elevated above demagogues and warmongers.  

The Donoughmore Commissioners had been appointed by the socialist [[Sydney Webb]]. Webb was briefly the [[Secretary of State]] for the Colonies in the Lib-Lab coalition government of 1927. He appointed Commissioners whom he knew shared his desire for an equitable and socialist British empire and they in turn came up with a Constitutional arrangement for Sri Lanka, which would ensure that every community in the island had a chance of for power and prosperity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2678">{{see also|Mental capacity in England and Wales}}

An '''enduring power of attorney''' (EPA) under [[English law]] is a legal authorisation to act on someone else's behalf in legal and financial matters which (unlike other kinds of [[power of attorney]]) can continue in force after the person granting it loses mental capacity, and so can be used to manage the affairs of people who have lost the ability to deal with their own affairs, without the need to apply to the [[Court of Protection]]. 

EPA's were created by the [[Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985]]. It soon became apparent that the law relating to mental incapacity remained inadequate and between 1991 and 1993 the [[Law Commission]] published a series of consultation documents. In 1995 it published a report ''Mental Incapacity''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lc231.pdf], Law Commission report Mental Incapacity&lt;/ref&gt; which recommended the abolition of EPAs, noting that they could not handle health or welfare issues and assumed that a person either had mental capacity or did not. No provision existed for a partial intervention in a person’s affairs where the person concerned had partial or fluctuating capacity.

The Law Commission proposed the introduction of Continuing Powers of Attorney (CPAs). These were subsequently enacted by the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]] as [[Lasting_power_of_attorney|Lasting Powers of Attorney]] (LPAs). The Mental Capacity Act 2005 came into force on 1 October 2007 and no new EPAs can now be drawn up; however, one signed before that date remains valid and may still be registered with the [[Office of the Public Guardian (England and Wales)|Office of the Public Guardian]]. This is required when the donor begins to lose mental capacity&lt;ref&gt;Mental Capacity Act 2005, Schedule 4, paragraph 4(1)&lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike an LPA, an EPA can be used without registration for so long as the donor has mental capacity.

An EPA gives the person appointed as attorney the power to dispose of property, deal with financial affairs, sign documents and make purchases on behalf of the individual and make usual gifts. The attorney does not have the power to make substantial or unusual gifts, or make decisions about personal care and welfare.

{{Homicide}}
{{Feminism sidebar}}
'''Femicide''' or '''feminicide''' is a sex-based [[hate crime]] term, broadly defined as "the intentional killing of females (women or girls) because they are females", though definitions vary depending on the cultural context.&lt;ref name="femicide.net"&gt;[http://www.femicide.net COST Action 1206 - Femicide]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminism|Feminist]] author [[Diana E. H. Russell]] was the first person to define and disseminate this term in 1976. She defines the word as "the killing of females by males because they are female." Other feminists place emphasis on the intention or purpose of the act being directed at females specifically because they are female; others include the killing of females by females.&lt;ref name="Theories of femicide"&gt;Corradi, C., Marcuello-Servos, C., Boira, S. and Weil, S. 2016 'Theories of femicide and their significance for social research', ''Current Sociology'' 64(7): 975–995. Special Issue on Femicide. DOI:10.1177/0011392115622256.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the necessity of defining the murder of females separately from overall homicide is questioned. Opponents argue that since over 80% of all murder victims are men, the term places too much emphasis on the less prevalent murder of females. In addition, the study of femicide is a social challenge.&lt;ref name="The study of femicide is a social challenge"&gt;Marcuello-Servós, C, Corradi, C., Weil, S. and Boira, S.  2016a ‘Femicide: a Social Challenge’, ''Current Sociology'' 64(7):967–974. Special Issue on Femicide. DOI: 10.1177/0011392116639358.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative term offered is [[gendercide]], which is more ambivalent and inclusive. However, some feminists argue that the term ''gendercide'' perpetuates the taboo of the subject of the murder of females. Feminists also argue that the motives for femicide are vastly different than those for [[androcide]]. Instead of centering in street violence, much of femicide is centered within the home.

== History ==

=== Development of the term ===
The term ''femicide'' was first used in England in 1801 to signify "the killing of a woman."&lt;ref name="Corry"&gt;[[John Corry (writer)|Corry, John]]. (1801) ''A Satirical Review of London at the Commencement of the Nineteenth Century''. Edinburgh: T. Hurst, Paternoster-Row; Ogilvy and Son, Holborn; R. Ogle, Turnstile; and Ogle and Aikman&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, this term was published in Wharton's Law Lexicon.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd Ed.(1989) p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;  Another term used is ''feminicide'', which is properly formed from the Latin ''femina'', meaning "woman" ("femicide" being truncated).

The current usage emerged with the 1970s [[feminist movements]], which aimed to raise feminine consciousness and resistance against gender oppression.&lt;ref name="MassViolence"&gt;Josie Kaye, Femicide, Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence, [online], published on 3 November 2007, accessed 18 March 2013, URL : http://www.massviolence.org/Femicide, ISSN 1961-9898.&lt;/ref&gt; American author, Carol Orlock, is widely credited with initiating the usage of the term in this context in her unpublished anthology on femicide.&lt;ref name="MassViolence"/&gt; Diana Russell publicised the term at the Crimes Against Women Tribunal in 1976.&lt;ref name="Tribunal"&gt;Russell, Diana. "Femicide." Crimes Against Women: Proceedings of the International Tribunal . Ed. Diana Russell and Nicole Van de Ven. Berkeley, California: Russell Publications, 1990. 104-108. Web. 18 Mar. 2013. &lt;http://www.dianarussell.com/f/Crimes_Against_Women_Tribunal.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Here is part of what she wrote for the proceedings:
"We must realize that a lot of homicide is in fact femicide. We must recognize the sexual politics of murder. From the burning of witches in the past, to the more recent widespread custom of female infanticide in many societies, to the killing of women for "honor," we realize that femicide has been going on a long time. But since it involves mere females, there was no name for it until Carol Orlock invented the word 'femicide.'"&lt;ref name="Tribunal"/&gt; Until recently femicide was invisible in much of the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Making Femicide Visible"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Shalva|last1=Weil|title=Making femicide visible|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0011392115623602|journal=Current Sociology|date=2016-02-02|pages=1124–1137|volume=64|issue=7|doi=10.1177/0011392115623602|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary Definition by Feminists ===
Feminist author [[Diana E. H. Russell|Diana Russell]] narrows the definition of femicide to "the killing of females by males because they are female". Russell places emphasis on the idea that males commit femicide with sexist motives.&lt;ref name="Russell2"/&gt; She also chooses to replace the word woman with female to show that femicide can occur to both girls and infants as well.&lt;ref name="Russell2"&gt;Russell, Diana E.H. and Harmes, Roberta A, (Eds.), Femicide in Global Perspective New York: Teachers College Press, 2001, Ch. 2, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Russell believes her definition of femicide applies to all forms of sexist killing, whether they be motivated by [[misogyny]] (the hatred of females), by a sense of superiority over females, by sexual pleasure, or by assumption of ownership over women.&lt;ref name="Russell2"/&gt;
Russell's broader definition of femicide is stated as this,
: "Femicide is on the extreme end of a continuum of antifemale terror that includes a wide variety of verbal and physical abuse, such as rape, torture, sexual slavery (particularly in prostitution), incestuous and extrafamilial child sexual abuse, physical and emotional battery, [[sexual harassment]] (on the phone, in the streets, at the office, and in the classroom), genital mutilation (clitoridectomies, excision, infibulations), unnecessary gynecological operations (gratuitous hysterectomies), forced [[heterosexuality]], forced sterilization, forced motherhood (by criminalizing contraception and abortion), psychosurgery, denial of food to women in some cultures, cosmetic surgery, and other mutilations in the name of beautification. Whenever these forms of terrorism result in death, they become femicides."&lt;ref name="Russell 3"&gt;Russell, Diana E.H. "The Origin and the Importance of the Term Femicide" http://www.dianarussell.com/origin_of_femicide.html Dec 2011. Accessed Mar 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

She includes covert killings of women as well, such as the mass murder of female babies due to male preference in cultures such as India and China, as well as deaths related to the failure of social institutions, such as the criminalization of [[abortion]] or the prevalence of female genital mutilation.&lt;ref name="Russell2"/&gt;

== Other definitions ==
Diana Russell's definition is not accepted by all scholars as the standard definition for femicide. Jacquelyn Campbell and Carol Runyan use the word femicide to reference "all killings of women regardless of motive or perpetrator status"&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell, J., and C. W. Runyan. "Femicide: Guest Editors' Introduction." Homicide Studies 2.4 (1998): 347-52. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors argue that motive is not always empirically possible to be determined, and so must be removed from the qualification for femicide in order to gather data.

On the other hand, authors Desmond Ellis and Walter Dekesedery take a different approach by viewing the definition for femicide as "the intentional killing of females by males".&lt;ref name="Desmond"&gt;Ellis, Desmond and Walter Dekesedery. (1996). The wrong stuff: An introduction to the sociological study of deviance. Scaborough, Ontario: Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; These feminists require that femicide always be intentional unlike the inclusion of covert femicide in Diana Russell's definition.&lt;ref name="Desmond"/&gt;

Most of these definitions imply that the perpetrator of femicide is a man, but South Asian feminists differ in their definition stating that femicide is "the intentional killing of females by men and of females by other females in the interests of men".&lt;ref name="Russell2"/&gt; Examples of this include neglect of female children in preference of males, as well as dowry related murder where female in-laws kill women due to dowry disputes. Moreover, COST Action 1206 provides definitions of femicide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.femicide.net/#!wg1/c1a8s&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these definitions refer to the idea that femicide is unique from non-gendered descriptions of murder and homicide. Instead, defining femicide exemplifies the fact that women are killed for different reasons and motives from those associated with typical descriptions of murder.&lt;ref name="Russell1"&gt;Radford, Jill, and Diana E. H. Russell. Femicide: The Politics of Woman Killing. New York: Twayne, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, femicide has seldom been investigated separately from homicide, and the goals of many of these authors is to make femicide a separate category.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; In 2013, COST set up Action IS-1206 entitled "Femicide across Europe".&lt;ref name="COST"&gt;[http://www.cost.eu COST]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Action IS-1206"&gt;[http://www.femicide.net/ COST Action IS-1206]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Combatting femicide in multiple ways"&gt;Weil, S. 2015, “Combatting femicide in multiple ways: the COST Action IS1206 on Femicide across Europe”. In: Filip A and Platzer M (eds) Femicide: Targeting Women in Conflict 3. Vienna: ACUNS, pp.139-141. [http://acuns.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Femicide-III_Core-Stanzell.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Femicide across Europe"&gt;Weil, S. 2015 “Femicide across Europe”. In: Dimitrijevic, M., Filip, A and Platzer M (eds) Femicide: Taking Action against Gender-Related Killing of Women and Girls 4. Vienna: ACUNS, pp.118-121. [http://fbf7c7e20b173f4d238f-5912a34ad37e49172ffd347ffbe5002d.r41.cf1.rackcdn.com/FemicideVol-IV.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The manifestations of femicide vary greatly. Using Diana Russell's definition, femicide includes intimate partner femicide, lesbicide, racial femicide, serial femicide, mass femicide, [[honor killing]] related femicide, [[dowry]] and more. Any act of sexual terrorism that results in death is considered a femicide. This includes forms of covert femicide as well, such as criminalization of [[abortion]] that leads to death from unsafe abortions, or death as a result of [[female genital mutilation]].

One of the most common and least publicized forms of femicide is that committed by an intimate partner of a female, such as a current or former husband, boyfriend or common-law husband. This form of femicide accounts for at least 35% of all murders of woman globally&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;WHO, Pan American Health Organization. Femocide: Understanding and Addressing Violence against Women. Publication no. WHO/RHR/12.38. N.p.: n.p.,   2012. http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/rhr12_38/en/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different areas of the world experience varying types of femicide. For example, the Middle East and South Asia have higher rates of [[honor killing]] which is defined as the murder of women by their family due to an actual or assumed sexual or behavioral transgression such as adultery, sexual intercourse, or even rape.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;

Depending on the definition, femicide can also include deaths as a result of [[female genital mutilation]], the intentional spreading of HIV/AIDS, and the unsafe abortions in countries where access to abortion is stymied or illegal.&lt;ref name="Russell2"/&gt;

=== Intimate partner ===
Intimate partner femicide, sometimes called intimate femicide, refers to "the killing of a woman by her intimate partner or her former intimate partner". These include former or current boyfriends, husbands and [[common-law]] husbands.

This form of femicide accounts for 40–50% of all deaths of American women killed,&lt;ref name="Monckton"/&gt; and each day in the United States results in the deaths of four women.&lt;ref name="Russell1"/&gt;. [[Spain]], on the other hand, reports an intimate partner femicide rate of one woman every two days. Yearly, [[India]]'s government reports the deaths of 5,000 woman to this cause, but this number is believed to be grossly underestimated due to the under-reported prevalence of honor killings and [[dowry]]-related murders. However, intimate partner homicide only accounts for 5–8% of all murders of men, disproportionately affecting women to a large extent, making it a gendered problem.&lt;ref name="Monckton"&gt;Monckton, Smith Jane. Murder, Gender and the Media: Narratives of Dangerous Love. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, women are disproportionately represented as victims of all family violence including [[incest]], [[sexual harassment]], [[rape]] and [[battery (crime)|battering]]. These acts of violence are found to escalate over time within a relationship, possibly resulting in femicide.&lt;ref name="Russell2"/&gt; The prevalence of intimate partner femicide dispels the myth that women have the most to fear from strangers, and instead are most often killed within the private sphere of the home, the area where they are supposedly most safe according to global ideals.&lt;ref name="Dawson"&gt;Dawson, M., and R. Gartner. "Differences in the Characteristics of Intimate Femicides: The Role of Relationship State and Relationship Status." Homicide Studies 2.4 (1998): 378-99. {{doi|10.1177/1088767998002004003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main motives that cause men to kill their intimate partners is [[jealousy]], which Jacquelyn Campbell argues is the male efforts to control and possess women to display ownership and reinforce [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name="Russell1"/&gt;

Risk factors that increase the likelihood of intimate partner femicide include: when a male has previously threatened to commit [[suicide]] or kill the woman if she cheats on him and/or leaves him, when there is elevated alcohol or drug abuse by either partner, or when a male attempts to control a woman's freedom. Two-fifths of intimate partner femicide are related to use of [[intoxicants]].&lt;ref name="Monckton"/&gt; Other factors commonly associated with male perpetrators of femicide include [[gun ownership]], forcing sexual intercourse, and [[unemployment]]. Risk factors for women include: if they are [[pregnant]], have faced prior abuse from their partner, are estranged from their partner or are attempting to leave a relationship, their likelihood of femicide increases.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; The presence of [[firearms]] within a home is a large factor in intimate partner femicide, and worldwide firearms are used in one-third of all femicides.&lt;ref name="Small arms"&gt;Nowak, Matthias. Femicide: A Global Problem. Geneva, Switzerland: Small Arms Survey, Feb. 2012. PDF. http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimate partner femicide, as reported in the media, often is presented sympathetically towards the male perpetrators. Males are seen as "being driven" to commit femicide due to a "breakdown in love attributed to the female".&lt;ref name="Monckton"/&gt; In defense trials, the defense of [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] is often used to reduce the time men serve in prison. This idea of provocation is that any "reasonable man can be provoked into killing by insubordination on the part of a woman." Conversely, women are not often able to use this idea of provocation in their own murder trials, and judges are less likely to accept claims of [[self-defense]], showing biased judging standards.&lt;ref name="Russell1"/&gt;

Factors that decrease the risk of intimate partner femicide include a separate domicile for women and other societal factors such as more [[police]] as well as mandated arrest for violation of [[restraining order]]s related to [[intimate partner violence]]. Karen D. Stout found that there is a correlation between the number of [[women's shelters]] in a state, number of [[rape crisis centers]] and a lowered rate of femicide. One explanation of this correlation is that the implementation of these measures have had a positive effect on lowering the femicide rate. Other effective legislation against femicide include legislation that defines civil injunction relief; defines physical abuse as a criminal offense'; allows arrest without a warrant; requires data collection and reporting; and provides funds for women's shelters.&lt;ref name="Russell1"/&gt;

=== Serial ===
Serial femicide is defined as "the sexually [[Sexual sadism disorder|sadistic]] killing of women," also called "sexual terrorism". Feminists emphasize that many cases of [[serial murder]] can also be considered to be cases of male-perpetrated crimes against women as a means for men to achieve sexual gratification and dominance over women. They claim that gender-neutral terms hide the reality that victims of serial murder are predominantly female and perpetrators predominantly male. Although over 90% of serial killers are male, not all are male; about 7% are female.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Association of Forensic Science, by FBI Special Agent [[Robert K. Ressler]] "The Serial Killer," Harold Schechter. http://crimecasefiles.com/forum/diagnosis-of-categories-and-symptoms/50-characteristics-of-serial-killers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Male serial murderers tend to use more brutal methods of killing such as suffocation and beatings, while women use methods such as poison or less violent measures. In addition, while a large percentage of male serial killers do focus on women as their targets, female serial killers are less likely to focus exclusively on males as targets. Some male serial killers focus on males as targets, such as [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] and [[Wayne Williams]]&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, R. "Slain and Slandered: A Content Analysis of the Portrayal of Femicide in Crime News." Homicide Studies 13.1 (2009): 21-49. {{doi|10.1177/1088767908326679}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ways serial murderers are portrayed in the media reflect the views on femicide and gender in society. Often, murders of prostitutes, low-income women and women of color by serial killers receive less attention in the media than [[Missing white woman syndrome|the killings of younger, prettier, more affluent women]], usually married, engaged, or in relationships with much handsome, affluent, younger men their age. Serial killers are almost always portrayed as monsters and sociopaths in the news.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

According to the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Report, local police reported that about 33,000 homicides of women remain unsolved.

Feminists such as Diana Russell and Jane Caputi believe that there is a link between the rise of serial murders and the advent of [[pornography]]. Specifically, the advent of films that eroticize violence and murder of women has been correlated to the desires of serial killers. Numerous serial murderers filmed their victims as they violently killed them. These men include: [[Harvey Glatman]], [[Kenneth Bianchi]], and [[Leonard Lake]], to name a few.&lt;ref name="Russell1"/&gt; However, the link between pornography and serial murders is not proven.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

=== Racist ===
The Hope Movement defines racist femicide as racially motivated killing of women by men of a different race.&lt;ref&gt;"Hope Movement." Femicide. Web. 1 Apr 2013. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hopemovement.com/open-ur-eyes/16-femicide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130426143512/http://www.hopemovement.com/open-ur-eyes/16-femicide.html |archivedate=2013-04-26 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Diana Russell and fellow writer Jill Radford, "Racism interacts with violence against women and shapes both femicide itself and the ways it is addressed by the local community, the police, the media, and the legal system."&lt;ref name="Russell1"/&gt;
Russell and Radford, as well as many other feminist activists, assert that when looking at femicide, within the United States specifically, one must consider the politics of '''both''' sexism and racism in the murders of black women and the little justice that is often served.&lt;ref name="Russell5"&gt;Radford, Jill, and Diana E. H. Russell. Femicide: The Politics of Woman Killing. New York: Twayne, 1992. Print. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Media coverage especially can exhibit bias when covering the murders of black versus white women. Jaime Grant writes on the murder of 12 young women in Boston and exposes the "...racism in media coverage, which virtually ignored these killings initially and later depicted the victims in racist and sexist stereotypes as runaways or prostitutes."&lt;ref name="Russell1"/&gt; In addition, police response and investigation can often differ based on race of the victim.&lt;ref name="Russell1"/&gt;

=== Lesbicide ===
According to Diana Russell and Jill Radford, lesbicide, also known as homophobic femicide,&lt;ref name = "Russell1"/&gt; has a long history of legalized murder of lesbians in many different cultural contexts:
* Roman civilization: a married woman convicted of engaging in any sexual activity with another woman could be killed by her husband as a "just penalty for her crime".&lt;ref name="Russell1"/&gt;
* Medieval Europe: secular and religious doctrine mandated death for lesbianism. "The famous 1260 Code of Orleans in France secularized the prohibition of lesbianism, mandating that for the first two offenses a woman would 'lose her member'; for the third offense she would be burned."&lt;ref name="Russell1"/&gt;
* Witch-hunt of the 15th century: Witchcraft was linked with heresy and homosexuality. The phrase ''femina cum feminus'' (woman with woman) was apparently often an accusation in witch trials.&lt;ref name="Russell1"/&gt;

Today, lesbianism is no longer a capital crime but it remains criminalized by many governments and condemned by most religions.&lt;ref name="Russell1"/&gt; Torture and murder of lesbians occurs in every part of the world, even in "developed" countries.&lt;ref name = "Hawthorne"/&gt; According to Dr. Susan Hawthorne of Victoria University, "...domination is exemplified in the punishment of lesbians as outsiders in patriarchal culture..."&lt;ref name = "Hawthorne"/&gt; Dr. Hawthorne goes on to elaborate that lesbians are often killed or tortured or generally denied rights because of their invisibility in terms of political power and social representation: "When it comes to campaigns on violence against women, lesbians are either left out or included only in a footnote..."&lt;ref name = "Hawthorne"/&gt;

==== Corrective rape ====
According to political scientist and women's studies scholar, Susan Hawthorne, [[corrective rape]] is a hate crime that constitutes forced sexual activity with a woman who is gender nonconforming and/or a lesbian. The goal of corrective rape is to "correct" the victim's sexual orientation and make them heterosexual and/or to make them behave in a more gender-conforming manner.&lt;ref name="Hawthorne"&gt;Hawthorne, Susan. "Ancient Hatred And Its Contemporary Manifestation: The Torture Of Lesbians." ''Journal of Hate Studies'' 4.1 (2005): 33–58. Academic Search Complete.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to death in some cases.&lt;ref name="Hawthorne"/&gt; There are documented cases of corrective rape in South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, Lee.

GMHC Treatment Issues (2009): 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eudy Simelane]] was a famous soccer player who played for the South Africa women's national football team and LGBT rights activist; her murder was a highly publicized instance of simultaneous corrective rape and lesbicide in [[South Africa]].

== Worldwide ==
Every year 66,000 women are violently killed globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Femicide: A Global Problem|url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/about-us/highlights/highlight-rn14.html|website=Small Arms Survey|publisher=Small Arms Survey|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rates of femicide differ depending on the specific country, but of the countries with the top 25 highest femicide rates, 50% are in Latin America, with number one being [[El Salvador]]. Also included in the top 25 are seven European countries, three Asian countries, and one African country, [[South Africa]]. It has been found that as the rate of femicide increases, the ratio of intimate partner femicide decreases, pointing to the idea that as violence in a society increases, so does the femicide rate due to violence outside the home{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}. This is often tied to high levels of tolerance of violence against women in countries{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}. In a UN study, 1 in 4 women in the top 25 countries agreed that it was justifiable to be beaten or hit for arguing with their husband or refusing to have sex with him{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}. Overall, data on femicide worldwide is poor, and often countries do not report gender differences in murder statistics.&lt;ref name= Geneva&gt;Alvazzi del Frate, Anna. 2011.

=== United States ===
Femicide in the [[United States]] accounts for the deaths of four women daily.&lt;ref name="Russell2"/&gt; It is the leading cause of death for African American women ages 15–24 and of on-the-job death for women. Since the 1970s, the rates of femicide in the United States has fluctuated between 3.8–4.5 deaths per less than 100,000 women{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}.&lt;ref name="Moracco"&gt;Moracco, K. E., C. W. Runyan, and J. D. Butts. "Femicide in North Carolina, 1991-1993: A Statewide Study of Patterns and Precursors." Homicide Studies 2.4 (1998): 422-46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the largest predictors of femicide in the United States is the appearance of physical abuse, which was found in 79% of all femicide cases in North Carolina.&lt;ref name="Moracco"/&gt; Gun availability in the United States has also had a substantial effect on femicide, correlating to 67.9% of deaths in a study by Karen D. Stout.&lt;ref name="Russell2"/&gt; Living in neighborhoods with increased [[poverty]], ethnic heterogeneity and decreased collective efficacy (social cohesion among neighbors) are all found to be linked to increased femicide rates in that area.&lt;ref name="Frye"&gt;Frye, V., S. Galea, M. Tracy, A. Bucciarelli, S. Putnam, and S. Wilt. "The Role of Neighborhood Environment and Risk of Intimate Partner Femicide in a Large Urban Area." American Journal of Public Health 98.8 (2008): 1473-479. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the nation femicide rates vary, with the highest rate in 1985 being found in Alabama and the lowest in Iowa. Geographically, the highest prevalence of femicide occurs in the Southeast and Southwest areas of the country. The perpetrators of femicide are most often the husbands of the murdered woman, followed by boyfriends and male paramours on the side. They tend to be of the same race as their victim, but generally older. The act is most often carried out with firearms, followed by knives and beatings. Feminists view the American attitude towards love as one of the reasons these intimate partner femicide occur. Feminist [[Hildegard Peplau]] states that Americans are sentimental about love and that they de-emphasize the cultural forces that shape whom you love and the dynamics of that love. She believes the United States greatly neglects the dynamics of power in a relationship, and how that power goes to the male. Because of these patriarchal values in this nation, regulation of females by males is culturally permitted inside the private and outside the public sphere of the home. In fact, the home is one of the most dangerous areas for a woman to be in terms of femicide. Also, reporting of female victims of femicide in the US is stymied due to the assumption that female victims are not an anomaly, but are driven by their perceived vulnerability and passivity.&lt;ref name="Russell2"/&gt;

=== Latin America ===
{{bullshit|section |date=October 2018}}
[[File:No femicidio.jpg|thumb|A candle memorial to women killed by femicide (femicidio), [[Chile]], 2007.]]
[[Feminists]] in [[Latin America]] have been among the first to adopt the term femicide,  referring to the [[Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez|female homicides]] in [[Ciudad Juárez|Juarez]], Mexico. The use of this term inspired feminists in Latin America to organize anti-femicide groups to try to challenge this social injustice towards women.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Diana E.H. "The Origin and the Importance of the Term Femicide" http://www.dianarussell.com/origin_of_femicide.html Dec 2011. Accessed Nov 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term femicide, and the creation of anti-femicide feminist organizations, spread from Mexico to many other Latin American countries, like Guatemala.&lt;ref name = "Guatemala"/&gt; According to Julia Estela Monárrez-Fragoso of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte based in Ciudad Juarez, victims are often blamed for being out late or hanging around "questionable" areas such as discotecas or nightclubs.&lt;ref name="Monarrez"&gt;Monárrez Fragoso, Julia Estela. 2010. “The Victims of Ciudad Juárez Feminicide: Sexually Fetishized Commodities.” In Terrorizing Women: Feminicide in the Americas. Durham: Duke University Press. 59-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, more than five thousand women and girls have been brutally murdered in Guatemala.

The report argues that enforcing laws against murder of women is a low priority of state governments because of patriarchal beliefs and assumptions about the role of women in society.&lt;ref name = "Guatemala"&gt;Davis, Lisa, and Bradley Parker.

Many activists and scholars{{weasel inline|date=October 2018}}, such as Monárrez, have argued that connections exist between the femicides and neoliberal policies, namely [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). They believe that the treaty has served to open trade borders and increase foreign investment, which have served to open trade borders and increase foreign investment targeted at manufacturing low-cost garments in maquiladoras.&lt;ref name="Monarrez"/&gt; It has been observed that many of the women killed in Juarez are young mothers who migrate to this region seeking employment in [[maquiladoras]].&lt;ref name="Monarrez"/&gt; They then become easy targets because they are separated from their family and are typically alone when traveling home. Policy solutions in Central America have tried making transportation safer (see below for policy solutions). Other scholars, such as Itallurde, point to the culpability of corporations "...based on the concepts and doctrines of tortuous negligence, failure to protect, and aiding and abetting".&lt;ref name = "Itullurde"&gt;Iturralde, Christina. 2010. “Searching for Accountability on the Border: Justice for the Women of Ciudad Juárez.” In Terrorizing Women: Feminicide in the Americas. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as historians Steven Volk and Marian Schlotterbeck, hypothesize that there may be a "macho backlash" behind these killings: "Certainly male egos, of fathers and would-be boyfriends, must suffer some deflation from this dramatic change in the economic influence of these young women."&lt;ref name = "VolkSchlotterbeck"&gt;Volk, Steven S. and Marian E.

=== Europe ===

{{legend|#6f2c91|Femicide by intimate partners}}
{{legend|#a6ce39|Femicide by family members}}]]
In Europe, agencies have funded initiatives on gender and violence but not specifically on femicide. Research is in its infancy and uncoordinated. A COST Action IS1206 &lt;ref name="femicide.net"/&gt; has established the first pan-European coalition on femicide with researchers who are already studying the phenomenon nationally, in order to advance research clarity, agree on definitions, improve the efficacy of policies for femicide prevention, and publish guidelines for the use of national policy-makers.&lt;ref name="Femicide across Europe"/&gt;

Available data are limited: [[Eurostat]] covers only 20 countries&lt;ref&gt;Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, France, Italy, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Germany, Latvia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Netherlands, Spain, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia, Switzerland, and United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; and there are discrepancies in the way in which the data is collected. According to available data in [[Western Europe]] the average annual rate is 0.4 victims of femicide for every 100,000 women. The worst situations are found in [[Montenegro]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]]. In most countries, the partner is the most common perpetrator, but there are exceptions: in Lithuania and Bosnia and Herzegovina the majority of femicides are committed by family members. Also, while male victims of homicide have been in sharp decline in recent years, the number of women murdered in Europe, not necessarily at the hands of a partner or family member, remains constant, with a slight increase from 2013 to 2015.&lt;ref name=edjnet&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bona |first1=Marzia |last2=Burba |first2=Alberto |title=Femicide in Europe is a widespread issue |url=https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/index.php/eng/News/Data-news/Femicide-in-Europe-is-a-widespread-issue |accessdate=7 September 2018 |work=OBC Transeuropa/EDJNet |date=28 November 2017}}  [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle East ===
Femicide and views that support gender-based social restrictions has led to the restriction of Turkish women's lives, deterioration of their health, and even punishment in cases of acting contrary to social expectations. A gender-based discriminatory notion of so-called "honor" is sometimes the cause of serious cases of health deterioration or mutilation among women in Turkey. According to a 2000 report by the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), approximately 5,000 women are murdered each year in the name of "honor". In the case of Turkey, according to the ''Report on Custom and Honor Killings'' by the country's General Directorate of Security, 1,028 custom and honor killings were committed for the sake of morals or honesty between the years of 2003 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gursoy, McCool, Sahinoglu, Yavuz Genc|first=Elif, William, Serap, Yasemin|date=May 7, 2016|title=Views of Women's Sexuality and Violence Against Women in Turkey: A Cross-Sectional Investigation Among University Students|url=|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
Femicide in Africa occurs in many different forms, including intimate partner femicide, mass femicide due to AIDS{{clarify|date=October 2018}}, honor killings and mass femicide due to female genital mutilations. The continent varies in cultural practices greatly and the manifestations of femicide differ greatly depending on the country. Northern African countries are predominantly [[Islamic]] in belief, such as Algeria. In [[Algeria]], as well as some Islamic countries on the African continent, women are regulated to gender-specific rules {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. One faction of men kill women who do not wear the traditional hijab, while others kill women who do wear the hijab {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. In this sense, author Rod Kilbeck explains that women become a commodity in the fight between these two factions.&lt;ref name="Russell2"/&gt;

One of the biggest health problems in Africa is the epidemic of [[HIV/AIDS]] which affects 22.9 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa as of 2009. Whenever AIDS results in the death of a female due to misogyny or [[sexist]] male behavior, it is considered a form of femicide according to Diana Russell's definition of femicide.&lt;ref name="Russell4"&gt;Russell, Diana EH. "AIDS As Mass Femicide: Focus On South Africa." AIDS As Mass Femicide: Focus On South Africa. In D.E.H. Russell and R.A. Harmes (Ed.), &lt;u&gt;Femicide In Global Perspective&lt;/u&gt;. New York, NY: Teacher's College Press, 2001, pp.100-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Female genital mutilation]] is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as "the removal of part or all of the external female genitalia and/or injury to the female genetic organs for cultural or other non-therapeutic reasons". Female genital mutilation results in femicide when women and girls die due to unhygienic practices of FGM that result in infection or death as well as the increased likelihood of contracting HIV/AIDS because of FGM.&lt;ref name=Russell4/&gt;

[[Rita Banerji]], feminist author and founder of [http://www.50millionmissing.info The 50 Million Missing Campaign] to end female [[gendercide]] in India, has said that there are also millions of girls and women killed through various forms of femicides, that extend across various age groups. In a U.N. [http://acuns.org/femicide-the-killing-of-a-woman-because-she-is-a-woman/ Symposium on Femicide] in Vienna on November 26, 2012, she talked about the six most widespread forms of femicide in India.&lt;ref&gt;Video: Six Wide-spread forms of Femicide. Gender Equal: A blog on India's Gendercide, Nov 26, 2012 http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/RitaBanerji-1601883-six-forms-femicide-india/&lt;/ref&gt; These included [[female infanticide]], the killing of girls under six years through starvation and violence, the killing of women due to [[forced abortions]], [[honor killings]], [[dowry murder]]s, and [[witch hunting|witch lynchings]]. Many of the femicides in India are perpetrated against girls.&lt;ref name="Femicide of girls in India"&gt;Weil, S. and Mitra, N. 2016f. ‘Femicide of Girls in India’, Femicide: Taking Action against Gender-Related Killing of Women and Girls 6. Vienna: ACUNS [http://acuns.org/femicide-volume-vi-violence-against-girls-in-flight/ Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite progressive legal reforms in many parts of the region, strong patriarchal values are maintained and help perpetuate the subordination of women.&lt;ref name="HRC2"&gt;Manjoo, Rashida. Report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, Rashida Manjoo 2012. 5. Web. 18 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Special Rapporteur on violence against women for the Human Rights Council, key factors behind gender-motivated killings of women in Asia are the high level of importance placed on women's chastity and their subordination in the greater society.&lt;ref name="HRC2"/&gt; For example, while the Penal Code of India now specifically prohibits dowry, the reported number of dowry-related deaths of women has almost doubled from 4,836 to 8, 383 over the past twenty years (1990–2009).&lt;ref name="HRC2"/&gt; The code is also criticized for having a low impact on criminalization of perpetrators noted in the low conviction rate of ten per cent.&lt;ref name="HRC2"/&gt; Suicide is the leading cause of death for Nepalese women in the reproductive age group, with causes ranging from domestic abuse, forced marriage, casting out of widows, and lack of property rights.&lt;ref name="HRC2"/&gt; In this context there is minimal acceptance and respect of young girls and women and often an absence of family support, which result in a variety of context-specific versions of femicide and gender-based violence in the region: honour killings, acid burning attacks, witch-hunting, [[feticide|foeticide]], and gender-based violence during caste and communal conflict.&lt;ref name="HRC2"/&gt;

== Policy implications ==
=== Central America ===
Central American policymakers have experimented with the creation of "female friendly urban zones" over the past decade.&lt;ref name="McAnarney"&gt;McAnarney, Alex. "Femicide in Central America: is creating Female-Friendly Urban Zones really the solution?." Open Democracy. N.p., 15 Nov 2012. Web. 18 Mar 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; "Pink" public transportation networks have been established in Mexico, Brazil, El Salvador and Guatemala to provide women-only forms of public transportation in an effort to stem the sexual harassment and provide safety for women. These efforts have received substantial praise and criticism.&lt;ref name="McAnarney"/&gt;

Criticism from feminists and others often point to the efficacy of gender segregation in changing gender norms of oppression - specifically the Latin American cultural conventions of "machismo" and "marianismo," which are powerful social regulators throughout the region.&lt;ref name="McAnarney"/&gt;

==== Ciudad mujer, the city for women ====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:"Inauguration of Ciudad Mujer in El Salvador, March 2011.jpg".jpg|thumbnail|Opening of Ciudad Mujer in El Salvador, March 2011]] --&gt;

In El Salvador, an endeavour has been made to create multiple government centers that house many gender-specific services in one place to cut down on commute time and increase the physical safety of women as they seek services such as counseling, child care, and reproductive health.&lt;ref name="McAnarney"/&gt; "The first center hopes to provide access to an estimated 162,000 women from the neighboring departments of La Libertad and Sonsonate. Supported by former Chilean president and head of UN Women Michelle Bachelet, the initiative cost $3.2 million, with an additional $20 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank earmarked for the construction of new sites."&lt;ref name="McAnarney"/&gt;

Critics of this action point to the contradictory [[Abortion in El Salvador|abortion laws in El Salvador]] that are some of the harshest in the world: abortion is completely illegal even in an effort to save the life a mother or to help a survivor of incest or rape. "Coupled with the judicial system's weaknesses, violence is abetted by the same government that aims to protect and defend. High levels of impunity leave many crimes unresolved or unreported."&lt;ref name="McAnarney"/&gt;

==== Guatemala Decree 22 ====
[[Guatemala]] has championed the use of femicide as a concept by incorporating the term in its constitution. Lawmakers in this country passed Decree 22 in 2008 that defined Laws Against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence Against Women. These laws include 28 articles about prosecutable types of [[violence against women]]. They also created the Office of the Presidential Commission Against Femicide, enforcing the concept in the government, as well as an anti-femicide unit of the National police. Some results of the laws have proved encouraging, allowing many women to now report violence perpetrated against them. In the first month of 2010, a total of 27,000 women reported violence against them to the state, a large increase in the number of reported crimes. The laws also have helped several people jail their assailants and has increased the severity of punishments for perpetrators. However, the actual enforcement of the new laws has been varied.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Few offenders are ever actually convicted for the specific crime of femicide, and there are only three public prosecution offices in the entire country able to deal with the issue of femicide.&lt;ref name=Shulman&gt;Shulman, Aaron. "The Rise of Femicide." The New Republic. New Republic, 29 Dec. 2010. Web. 01 Apr. 2013. &lt;https://newrepublic.com/femicide-guatemala-decree-22?page=0,0&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, only 127 convictions in 2010 occurred for female violence even though 46,000 cases overall were registered. Also, from 2000-2008, 98 percent of all femicide cases have still remained in [[impunity]]. Some feminists argue that the culture in Guatemala is to blame. They cite that many male judges and other male government officials are sympathetic to the view that men's actions are justified because they remain within the private sphere of the home. Attorney Romeo Silverio Gonzalez argued for this viewpoint when he stated that the new laws of Decree 22 were unconstitutional. He said that the laws were in contradiction to the private affairs of marriage. Attorney General Claudia Paz countered his viewpoint ultimately defending the laws by justifying their existence because they protect women's rights. Overall, the legislation of these new laws has helped Guatemala improve the awareness of femicide and reporting of the crime, but enforcement and justice for femicide still has not been totally achieved.&lt;ref name=Andrade&gt;Andrade, Kara. "Protecting the Rights of Guatemalan Women." Americas Quarterly. Americas Society and the Council of the Americas, 13 Oct. 2011. Web. 01 Apr. 2013. &lt;http://www.americasquarterly.org/node/2963&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Femicide as the socially tolerated murder of women in Guatemala relies on the presence of systematic impunity, historically rooted gender inequalities, and the pervasive normalization of violence as a social relation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Colombia ====
Colombia has followed 16 other Latin American Countries by passing a law that define and punish femicide for being a specific crime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On July 6, 2015 the government of Colombia passed a law that legally defines femicide as a crime with 20 to 50 years of jail time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This new law is named after Rosa Elvira Cely, a Colombian woman who was raped and murdered in 2012.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Cely’s death sparked national outrage and caused thousands to march down the streets of Bogota. Her murderer was found guilty and sentenced to 48 years in prison. The challenge now becomes implementing the law. Miguel Emilio La Rota, head of public policy and planning at Colombia’s attorney general’s office, said that the prosecutor’s office must change the way it investigates femicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Colombia's new 'femicide' law targets violence against women|url = https://nypost.com/2015/08/20/colombias-new-femicide-law-targets-violence-against-women/|website = New York Post|date = 2015-08-20|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins to 2000===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:EWField.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edwin Wilkins Field]], who co-founded Field Roscoe &amp; Co. in 1835]] --&gt;
The origins of Fieldfisher can be traced back to the founding of the law firm Field Roscoe &amp; Co. by [[Edwin Wilkins Field]] in 1835. In 1865 [[Theodore Waterhouse]] founded Waterhouse &amp; Co. In 1897 Charles Fisher started his articles with Thomas Peacock, which later became TF Peacock Fisher. In 1930 Field Roscoe merged with Treherne Higgins. In 1969 Field Roscoe and TF Peacock Fisher merged to form Field Fisher &amp; Co. 

In 1972 Field Fisher &amp; Co. merged with Martineau and Reid to become Field Fisher Martineau. Field Fisher Waterhouse was created in 1989 by the merger of Field Fisher Martineau and Waterhouse &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=lwffw&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2009/12/13/field-fisher-waterhouse/|title=Field Fisher Waterhouse|accessdate=6 November 2016|publisher=Legal Week|date=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field Fisher Martineau was located at Lincoln’s Inn House in [[Holborn]], close to [[Red Lion Square]], a very convenient location for the law courts. Waterhouse &amp; Co was originally located near [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and in 1971 had just nine partners; at the time all British law firms were fairly small they were not permitted to have more than twenty partners until 1968. The combined firm moved to new premises in [[Vine Street, London|Vine Street]] in June 1990.

The oil company [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] was a key client of Waterhouse &amp; Co. and the firm worked on all of Shell’s major real estate deals, in particular its move to the [[Shell Centre]] in the 1950s. The firm’s relationship with Shell led to the development of a Japanese desk following a recommendation to Mitsubishi Bank by Shell.

In 1998 Field Fisher Waterhouse merged with Allison &amp; Humphreys (A&amp;H).&lt;ref name=tl181197&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/17-november-1997/field-fisher-takes-over-allison-humphreys/|title=Field Fisher takes over Allison Humphreys|accessdate=6 November 2016|publisher=Legal Week|date=18 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; A&amp;H was a media and communications specialist and complemented Field Fisher Waterhouse’s IT and internet expertise.&lt;ref name=tl181197/&gt; The [[BBC]] was one of the key clients that A&amp;H lawyers brought to the firm.&lt;ref name=tl181197/&gt;

===2000 to present===
In June 2006 Field Fisher Waterhouse converted to LLP status.

In 2007 the firm took its first steps into Europe; in April offices were established in Brussels and Hamburg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2007/07/11/field-fisher-continues-euro-push-with-brussels-corporate-recruit/|title=Field Fisher continues Euro push with Brussels corporate recruit|accessdate=6 November 2016|publisher=Legal Week|date=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2010/02/26/field-fisher-hamburg-partner-duo-quit-to-launch-new-business/|title=Field Fisher Hamburg partner duo quit to launch new business|accessdate=6 November 2016|publisher=Legal Week|date=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November an office in Paris was opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/29-october-2007/ffw-splits-ally-dubarry-to-open-in-paris-2/|title=FFW splits ally Dubarry to open in Paris|accessdate=6 November 2016|publisher=The Lawyer|date=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm subsequently opened additional German offices in Munich and Düsseldorf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thelawyer.com/issues/online/ffw-snares-howrey-team-for-launches-in-munich-and-dusseldorf/|title=FFW snares Howrey team for launches in Munich and Dusseldorf|accessdate=6 November 2016|publisher=Legal Week|date=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3018">{{History of Monaco}}
The '''Franco-Monégasque Treaties''' of 1861, 1918 and 2002 are the basis of the relationship between [[France]] and the [[Principality of Monaco]]. The treaties define Monaco's independent status and sovereignty, as well as the rights of succession of the princely [[House of Grimaldi]].

==1861 Treaty==
The Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861 recognised the sovereignty of [[Monaco]]. Previously, under the [[Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]], the principality had been a [[protectorate]] of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].

==1918 Treaty==
A second treaty was agreed on July 17, 1918, owing to the [[Monaco Succession Crisis of 1918]] near the end of the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110519065147/http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/27/26/00053293.pdf Text of 1918 treaty; accessed from the U.N. website Dec 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the [[Louis II, Prince of Monaco|heir]] to the Monégasque throne had no legitimate children, and the possibility of his German cousins, the [[Duke of Urach|Dukes of Urach]], succeeding in the future to the throne was unacceptable to the French.

==2002 Treaty==
A third treaty was signed on October 24, 2002. The new treaty addressed issues of sovereignty raised by the 2002 revision of Monaco's constitution. Under those constitutional revisions, approved by the 2002 treaty, although only a ''born'' member of the [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldi line]] may now wear the Crown, Monaco assumes the unilateral prerogative to alter the [[order of succession]] and the principality's independence is explicitly secured. This resolved Monégasque concerns that under the 1918 treaty [[dynasty|dynastic]] acts affecting the succession (such as marriage or adoption within the reigning [[House of Grimaldi]]) required French assent, yet if a vacancy on the throne occurred, Monaco would have automatically become a French [[protectorate]]. That prospect no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cup.cam.ac.uk/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9789067042192 Monaco Minister Plenipotentiary Georges Grinda (trans. Jorri C. Duursma).

The '''Gonghe Regency''' ({{zh|c=共和|p=Gòng Hé}}) was an [[interregnum]] period in Chinese history from 841 to 828 BC, after [[King Li of Zhou]] was exiled by his nobles until the ascension of his son, [[King Xuan of Zhou]]. (''The Cambridge History of Ancient China'' gives the starting date as 842.)

==History==
According to the [[Han Dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]] (who interpreted ''Gonghe'' as 'joint harmony' in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''), during the Gonghe regency, the Zhou Dynasty was ruled jointly by two dukes—the Duke of Zhou (not to be confused with the first and most well-known [[Duke of Zhou]], who must have been his ancestor) and the [[Duke of Shao]] (召公—similarly, not to be confused with the first and most well-known Duke of Shao). But according to the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'', the Gonghe regency was ruled by a single person—the Count of Gong (共伯), whose name was He (和). This reading has almost certainly been confirmed by a bronze inscription.

The first year of the Gonghe regency, 841 BC, is highly significant in ancient Chinese history, in that Sima Qian was able to construct a year-by-year chronology back to that point, but he and subsequent historians were unable to confidently date any earlier events in Chinese history.  Sima himself found the information about earlier dates in his sources to be unreliable and contradictory and so chose not to adopt them in his work.  The government of the [[People's Republic of China]] sponsored the [[Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project]], a multidisciplinary project that sought to give better estimates for dates prior to 841 BC, but the project's draft report, published in 2000, has been criticized by various scholars{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

Although the term ''gonghe'' was borrowed into modern Chinese for the word '[[republic]]', the Gonghe period during the Zhou Dynasty does not confer any republican connotations.

{{main|Children in cocoa production}}

The '''Harkin–Engel Protocol''',{{Ref label|A|A|A}} sometimes referred to as the '''Cocoa Protocol''', is an international agreement aimed at ending the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention#Predefined worst forms of child labour|worst forms of child labor]] (according to the [[International Labour Organization]]'s [[ILO Convention 182|Convention 182]]) and [[forced labor]] (according to ILO [[Forced Labour Convention|Convention 29]]) in the production of [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]], the main ingredient in [[chocolate]]. The protocol was negotiated by [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Tom Harkin]] and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Eliot Engel]] in response to a documentary and multiple articles in 2000 and 2001 reporting widespread child [[slavery]] and [[Trafficking of children|child trafficking]] in the production of cocoa. The protocol was signed in September 2001. Joint Statements in 2001, 2005 and 2008 and a Joint Declaration in 2010 extended the commitment to address the problem. {{as of|2012}}, it is unclear if the protocol reduced [[children in cocoa production|child labor in the production of cocoa]], though the [[cocoa industry]] claims five of the six articles have been addressed and the final one is being actively pursued.

In 2001, US Representative [[Eliot Engel]] introduced a legislative amendment to an agriculture bill.

Senator [[Tom Harkin]] and Engel negotiated a deal with the cocoa industry to create the Harkin–Engel Protocol.{{Ref label|A|A|A}}&lt;ref name="Tiger"/&gt; The protocol was signed in September 2001 with the objective to eliminate the "[[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention#Predefined worst forms of child labour|worst forms of child labor]]" and adult forced labor on cocoa farms in West Africa.&lt;ref name="HE Protocol"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cocoainitiative.org/en/documents-manager/english/54-harkin-engel-protocol/file |title= Protocol for the growing and processing of cocoa beans and their derivative products in a manner that complies with ILO Convention 182 concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labor |publisher= [[International Cocoa Initiative]] |year= 2001 |accessdate= 25 April 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151208022828/http://www.cocoainitiative.org/en/documents-manager/english/54-harkin-engel-protocol/file |archivedate= 8 December 2015 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed and witnessed by the heads of eight major chocolate companies, Harkin, Engel, Senator [[Herb Kohl]], the ambassador of Côte d'Ivoire, the director of the [[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labor]], and others.&lt;ref name="HE Protocol"/&gt;

==Protocol and 2001 Joint Statement==
The Harkin–Engel Protocol is a voluntary public-private agreement to eliminate the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention#Predefined worst forms of child labour|worst forms of child labor]] (defined according to the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO)'s [[ILO Convention 182|Convention 182]]) in the growth and processing of cocoa in [[Côte d’Ivoire]] and [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p7"&gt;Payson 2011, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol was a voluntary agreement that partnered governments, the global cocoa industry, cocoa producers, cocoa laborers, non-governmenal organizations.&lt;ref name="HE Protocol"/&gt; The agreement laid out a series of date-specific actions, including the development of voluntary standards of public certification.&lt;ref name="HE Protocol"/&gt; The Protocol did not commit the industry to ending all child labor in cocoa production, only the worst forms of it. The parties agreed to a six-article plan:
# Public statement of the need for and terms of an action plan—The cocoa industry acknowledged the problem of forced child labor and will commit "significant resources" to address the problem.
# Formation of multi-sectoral advisory groups—By 1 October 2001, an advisory group will be formed to research labor practices. By 1 December 2001, industry will form an advisory group and formulate appropriate remedies to address the worst forms of child labor.
# Signed joint statement on child labor to be witnessed at the ILO—By 1 December 2001, a statement must be made recognizing the need to end the worst forms of child labor and identify developmental alternatives for the children removed from labor.
# Memorandum of cooperation—By 1 May 2002, Establish a joint action program of research, information exchange, and action to enforce standards to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Establish a monitor and compliance with the standards.
# Establish a joint foundation—By 1 July 2002, industry will form a foundation to oversee efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. It will perform field projects and be a clearinghouse on best practices.
# Building toward credible standards—By 1 July 2005, the industry will develop and implement industry-wide standards of public certification that cocoa has been grown without any of the worst forms of child labor.&lt;ref name="HE Protocol"/&gt;

A 2001 Joint Statement extended the protocol to also identify and eliminate forced labor (defined according to ILO [[Forced Labour Convention|Convention 29]]) in the production of cocoa.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p100"&gt;Payson 2011, pp. 100–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The protocol laid out a [[non-binding]] agreement for the cocoa industry to regulate itself without any legal implications,&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p13"/&gt; but Engel threatened to reintroduce legislation if the deadlines were not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://engel.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=68&amp;sectiontree=6,64,68&amp;itemid=329 |title= For Valentines Day; Engel and Harkin warn Americans that holiday chocolate is made by child slaves |publisher= Eliot Engel House website |date= 14 February 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement was the one of the first times an American industry was subjected to [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]] and one of the first times self-regulation was used to address an international [[human rights]] issue.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p13"/&gt;

==2005 progress and Joint Statement==
By July 2005—the deadline date—the cocoa industry made progress on their goal to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Most of the requirements were achieved by the deadline.&lt;ref name="Payson2007 p21"&gt;Payson 2007, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Before the protocol was signed, the cocoa industry acknowledged the problem of forced child labor to address part of Article 1.&lt;ref name="HE Protocol"/&gt; A Joint Statement was made in 2001 to address part of Article 3.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p100"&gt;Payson 2011, pp. 100–2&lt;/ref&gt; The '''[[International Cocoa Initiative]]''' (ICI) was established in 2002 to address part of Article 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cocoainitiative.org/images/stories/pdf/ICI_Leaflets_presentations/ICI_Information_Kit_-_April_2012_-_About_the_ICI_Foundation.pdf |title= About the ICI Foundation |publisher= International Cocoa Initiative |accessdate= 27 April 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the ICI, $3 million was spent on pilot projects.&lt;ref name="Payson2007 p105"&gt;Payson 2007, pp. 105–16&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Institute of Tropical Agriculture]] (IITA) was assigned to survey West Africans about children in cocoa production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/cocoafindings.pdf |title= Summary of Findings from the Child Labor Surveys In the Cocoa Sector of West Africa: Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria |publisher= International Institute of Tropical Agriculture |date= July 2002 |accessdate= 27 April 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111024135108/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/cocoafindings.pdf |archivedate= 24 October 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilot projects were formed to monitor child labor.&lt;ref name="Joint2005"&gt;Payson 2011, pp. 107–9&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the cocoa industry created and funded Verification Working Group. The funding was discontinued in 2006, but another company was contracted to perform verification in 2007.&lt;ref name="Payson2007 p9"&gt;Payson 2007, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

But all the protocol requirements were not met by the deadline.&lt;ref name="Payson2007 p21"/&gt; The cocoa industry failed to create and implement an industry-wide certification standard to indicate that cocoa had not been produced with the worst forms of child labor.&lt;ref name="Payson2007 p21"/&gt; The chocolate companies were criticized for executing the protocol at the smallest cost,&lt;ref name="Tiger"/&gt; remaining mostly hands-off in the process without changing the process,&lt;ref name="ILRF 2005"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.laborrights.org/projects/childlab/cocoa_childlabor_update_May05.pdf |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051226133450/http://www.laborrights.org/projects/childlab/cocoa_childlabor_update_May05.pdf |title= May 2005 Report: Child Labor in Agriculture |publisher= International Labor Rights Fund |date= May 2005 |archivedate= 26 December 2005 |accessdate=28 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintaining a business model dependent on child labor.&lt;ref name="ILRF 2005"/&gt; More importantly, they did not alter the price of chocolate to enable the cocoa producers to end the practice of slavery.&lt;ref name="Tiger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ILRF 2005"/&gt; One of the major obstacles to executing the protocol was the [[First Ivorian Civil War|Ivorian Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Tiger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parenti"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/24/news/international/chocolate_bittersweet.fortune/ |title= Chocolate's bittersweet economy |author= Christian Parenti |work= Fortune |date= 15 February 2008 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[diamond]]s and [[timber]], cocoa was a [[conflict resource]] that made money for the militants.&lt;ref name="Parenti"/&gt;

By July 2005 the extent of child involvement in cocoa production was unclear. It was also unclear if the cocoa industry's efforts were helping the problem.&lt;ref name="Payson2007 p13"&gt;Payson 2007, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 2005, all the parties agreed to an extension of the protocol through a Joint Statement.&lt;ref name="Payson2010 p28"&gt;Payson 2010, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 Joint Statement gave the cocoa industry three more years to implement the protocol. The Joint Statement stated industry would form a certification system for half of the growing regions in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. The Joint Statement also stated industry would support programs for the local cocoa-growing communities including teacher training programs.&lt;ref name="Joint2005"/&gt;

The [[US Congress]] was not satisfied with the cocoa industry's response. It gave responsibility to the [[US Department of Labor]] to find a university contractor to oversee the efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p13"/&gt; In 2006, a $4.3 million contract was awarded to the [[Payson Center for International Development]] at [[Tulane University]] through 2009.&lt;ref name="Parenti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p13-4"&gt;Payson 2011, pp. 13–4&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Payson Center reported progress had been made, but children were still working in cocoa production, including performing dangerous tasks, and regularly miss school.&lt;ref name="Parenti"/&gt; The cocoa industry was criticized for a lack of certification standards and the governments of Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana were criticized for a lack of transparency.&lt;ref name="Parenti"/&gt; In 2006, the president of the [[World Cocoa Foundation]] said, "While progress has been made and we have learned valuable lessons, much more is required."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/who-we-are/general-press-releases/wcf_industryupdate.asp |title= Chocolate Industry Expands Sustainable Cocoa Farming Efforts |publisher= World Cocoa Foundation |date= 3 February 2006 |accessdate= 27 April 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120615125035/http://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/who-we-are/general-press-releases/wcf_industryupdate.asp |archivedate= 15 June 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the deadline passed, the [[International Labor Rights Fund]] filed a lawsuit in 2005 under the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]] against [[Nestle]], [[Cargill]] and [[Archer Daniels Midland]] on behalf of three Malian children. The suit alleged the children were trafficked to Côte d'Ivoire, forced into slavery, and experienced frequent beatings on a cocoa plantation.&lt;ref name="Dworkin"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Delicious-idea-End-child-slavery-by-eating-1837193.php |title= Delicious idea: End child slavery by eating chocolate |author= Tex Dworkin |newspaper= Houston Chronicle |date= 12 February 2007 |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IRLF suit"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.laborrights.org/stop-child-labor/cocoa-campaign/news/10993 |title= On Halloween, Nestlé Claims no {{sic|Respons|iblity|nolink=y}} for Child Labor |publisher= [[International Labor Rights Forum]] |date= 30 October 2006 |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|US District Court for the Central District of California]] determined corporations cannot be held liable for violations of international law and dismissed the suit.

==2008 progress and Joint Statement==
By the revised deadline—1 June 2008—all the objectives were still not met. Some progress had been made; for example, the cocoa industry had provided $10 million to the ICI. In 2006–07 the ICI had 17 training sessions in Côte d'Ivoire and 23 in Ghana to sensitize the governmental officials, police and media about child and adult labor practices. The focus of the Joint Statement was that of certification. The cocoa industry performed data collection had on 50% of the growing areas in both Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. But independent verification, partially funded by industry, on those areas was not fully completed. The deadline was extended until the end of 2010. At that time, industry was required to have a full certification and independent verification.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p111-4"&gt;Payson 2011, pp. 111–4&lt;/ref&gt;

All parties reaffirmed their commitment to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The cocoa industry committed to work with the governments of Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana to set up independent certification by the end of 2010; assist the governments to target remediation efforts based on the independent certification; and support the ICI as it expands to more local communities and provide training on safe labor practices.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p111-4"/&gt;

In 2009, cocoa from Côte d'Ivoire and [[Nigeria]] was added to a list of products made by forced child labor maintained by the Department of Labor.&lt;ref name="Payson2010 p29"&gt;Payson 2010, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; This listing stemmed from a request by [[Anti-Slavery International]] in 2004 to investigate if Ivorian cocoa should be on this list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-05-10/pdf/E4-1047.pdf  |title= Notice and Request for Information Regarding Forced/Indentured Child Labor Pursuant to Executive Order 13126 |publisher= US Federal Register |volume= 69 |issue=90 |date= 10 May 2004 |pages= 25923–5 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Executive Order 13126]] requires federal contractors who supply products on the list must prove they have made a good faith effort to determine if the products were produced under forced labor.&lt;ref name="EO 13126"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dol.gov/ILAB/regs/eo13126/main.htm |title= Executive Order 13126 |author= Bureau of International Labor Affairs |publisher= US Department of Labor |date= 3 April 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus contractors must prove they have made a good faith effort to determine if cocoa was produced under forced labor.&lt;ref name="EO 13126"/&gt; Côte d'Ivoire&lt;ref name="US State TIP IC"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/123361.pdf |title= Trafficking in Persons Report |publisher = US State Department |pages= 113–5 |date= June 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ghana&lt;ref name="US State TIP Gh"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/123362.pdf |title= Trafficking in Persons Report |publisher = US State Department |pages= 142–4 |date= June 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; were placed on the 2009 [[US State Department]]'s [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons#Activities|Tier 2 Watch List]] for human trafficking due in part to the trafficking of children in cocoa production.

In 2009 the Department of Labor awarded a second, $1.2 million contract to the Payson Center to continue the oversight through 2011.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p13-4"/&gt;

==2010 Joint Declaration and Framework of Action==
The 2010 Joint Declaration summarized the pledge of the Harkin–Engel Protocol and reaffirmed the commitment to achieve the objectives of the protocol. The purpose of the framework of action was to reduce the worst forms of child labor 70% by 2020. Specifically, they were to remove children from and prevent children's involvement in the worst forms of child labor, promote sustainable livelihoods for cocoa growers, establish and implement community-based child labor monitoring systems, and continue national child labor surveys. The Joint Declaration established the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group to coordinate the activities of the framework and provide governance.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p116-25"&gt;Payson 2011, pp. 116–25&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve the goals, the governments of Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana must fund and conduct child labor surveys, provide remediation for children removed from the worst forms of child labor, prevent children from becoming involved in the worst forms of child labor, enforce laws to protect the children from the worst forms of child labor, and develop the infrastructure of the cocoa growing regions. The responsibility of the cocoa and chocolate industries is to continue to support the child labor surveys, support remediation efforts, provide sustainable livelihoods for the households of cocoa growers, try to ensure cocoa supply chains are using safe practices. The industries will commit $7 million over the next five years with the possibility of $3 million more for remediation activities. The responsibility of the US Department of Labor is to commit $10 million in 2010 for a multi-year program to support the framework and report on the progress of these efforts.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p116-25"/&gt;

==2011 status update==
Household surveys and governmental research in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana showed that there were 1.8 million children working in cocoa agriculture. About 5% in Côte d'Ivoire and 10% in Ghana worked for pay. Children are commonly involved in hazardous work and some are still involved in the worst forms of child labor.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p7"&gt;Payson 2011, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2001 and 2009, several thousand children were involved in remediation activities including in each country. These activities include withdrawal, rehabilitation, reinsertion, education and vocational training and these efforts were attributed to funding related to the Harkin–Engel Protocol.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p8"&gt;Payson 2011, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 5% of all children were exposed to activities related to the protocol.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p7"/&gt;

In 2011, the Payson Center reported the cocoa industry has not fully completed any of the six articles. Industry had not completed the 2005 Joint Statement commitment of certification for 50% of the growing areas in the two countries, much less the 2008 Joint Statement commitment of remediation activities in 100% of the growing areas. Côte d'Ivoire had only achieved remediation in 3.8% and Ghana in 31% of the growing areas.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p9"&gt;Payson 2011, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The cocoa industry still has to prove it can self-regulate. The Payson Center recommended the industry create a certification system that can assure consumers the worst forms of child labor are not used in production, create an independent verification of that certification system, implement child labor monitoring systems, and increase remediation activities to address the worst forms of child labor.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p10-2"&gt;Payson 2011, pp. 10–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2001, the Child Labor Coalition, a collection of advocacy groups focusing on child labor issues in the US and worldwide, criticized the protocol for only addressing Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. It suggested extending the protocol to the whole world, because exploitative practices were also reported in the cocoa industries in [[Brazil]] and [[Indonesia]]. The Child Labor Coalition also recommended that the chocolate industry set the price of chocolate so that the producers make enough money to fairly compensate their workers.&lt;ref name="Tiger"/&gt;

In 2011, ten years after implementation, it was unclear if the protocol had any effect in reducing child labor. One Payson Center researcher claimed few of the protocol commitments have been implemented, but the ICI claimed five of the six articles have been completed and they are actively working on the sixth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/19/the-human-cost-of-chocolate/ |title= The Human Cost of Chocolate |author= Tricia Escobedo |publisher= [[CNN]] |date= 19 September 2011 |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, {{ill|Miki Mistrati|da}}, creator of the award-winning documentary, ''[[The Dark Side of Chocolate]]'', claimed the protocol is just “a document and politics” because there has been no progress. He thinks that the same issues will be present in five years and that changes will not come through the protocol, but instead from consumers who demand change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The bitter truth - Khaleej Times|url = http://www.khaleejtimes.com/article/20120224/ARTICLE/302249998/1002|website =[[Khaleej Times]]|date= February 24, 2012|accessdate = January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{Note label|A|A|A}}The protocol is formally called "Protocol for the Growing and Processing of Cocoa Beans and Their Derivative Products In a Manner that Complies with ILO Convention 182 Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor."&lt;ref name="HE Protocol"/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
{{Note label|B|B|B}}It has also been reported that this vote was 107–76,&lt;ref name="Salaam-Blyther"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Payson2010 p27"&gt;Payson 2010, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; but the final Payson report has the result as 291–115.&lt;ref name="Payson2011 p13"/&gt;

A '''''hudna''''' (from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|{{large|هدنة}}}} meaning "calm" or "quiet") is a [[truce]] or [[armistice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/axismundi/2009/06/28/negotiating-with-hamas-try-an-islamic-framework/ |title=Negotiating with Hamas? Try an Islamic Framework |last=Solomon |first=Erika |date=June 28, 2009 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=June 22, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005102954/http://blogs.reuters.com/axismundi/2009/06/28/negotiating-with-hamas-try-an-islamic-framework/ |archivedate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes translated as "[[cease-fire]]". In his medieval dictionary of [[Arabic language|classical Arabic]], the ''[[Lisan al-Arab]]'', [[Ibn al-Manzur]] defined it as:

: "''hadana'': he grew quiet. ''hadina'': he quieted (transitive or intransitive). ''haadana'': he made peace with. The noun from each of these is ''hudna''."{{cn|date=August 2014}}

A famous early ''hudna'' was the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]] between [[Muhammad]] and the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe.{{fact|date=December 2012}}

==Hudna in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict==
{{Israel–Palestinian peace process}}
In English, the term is most frequently used in reference to a [[ceasefire]] agreement in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], particularly one that would involve organizations such as [[Hamas]]. The concept of ''hudna'' was first introduced by [[Yasser Arafat]] in a secretly recorded 1994 speech in a Johannesburg mosque, where he repeatedly belittled the [[Oslo Accords]] as a mere "hudna", and cited the precedent set by Muhammad with the tribe of Quraish to back his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/935952/posts?page=1 |title=The Hidden Agenda behind a "Hudna" |last=Parsons |first=David |date=June 25, 2003 |work=[[Free Republic]] |accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=Free Republic is not a [[WP:RS]]|date=June 2018}} The concept was also proposed to reduce violence in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians by a Queen's University Belfast Professor in the period of 1999–2003 as a result of protracted negotiations with the Hamas leadership in the Gaza Strip, West Bank and abroad in countries like Lebanon and Syria. Some others claim that Israeli businessman Eyal Erlich in 2001, after seeing a ''hudna'' being declared in order to calm a [[feud]] in [[Jordan]] (cf. ''[[Haaretz]]'', January 2, 2002); introduced the idea, unsuccessfully, that Israel should suggest a mutual ''hudna'' as a prelude to a more lasting peace.

Despite the Israeli government's rejection of the idea, in summer 2003—following many years of negotiation and facilitation from European advisors and diplomats along with pressure from [[Abu Mazen]] and [[Egypt]]—[[Hamas]] and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] unilaterally declared a 45-day ceasefire, or ''hudna''. Its proponents commonly argued that such a cease-fire would allow for important violence reduction and act as a confidence-building measure to make further conflict resolution and peace negotiations possible; its opponents commonly argued that it would be a mere tactical maneuver enabling Palestinian groups to re-group and muster their strength in preparation for further attacks on Israelis, or Israel to continue expanding settlements, [[2007–2009 blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockading Palestinian towns]], and arresting members of such groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/651/re1.htm |title=Is the hudna over? |last=Amayreh |first=Khaled |date=August 20, 2003 |work=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |accessdate=June 22, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030823061937/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/651/re1.htm |archivedate=August 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''hudna'' started on June 29, 2003.

In an IDF operation to arrest Hamas militants, a gunfight broke out in which an Israeli soldier and two alleged Hamas militants were killed. Hamas responded with a [[suicide bombing]] on August 12, killing one Israeli civilian. Fatah claimed responsibility for a second [[suicide bombing]] on August 12 that killed another Israeli citizen. Despite this ''de facto'' violation of the ''hudna'', Hamas stated that the cease-fire would continue. Hostilities then escalated: the Israeli army killed [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]]'s Muhammad Seeder on August 14; the [[Jerusalem bus 2 massacre]] by Hamas and Islamic Jihad on August 19 killed 23 and wounded 136 people; and Israeli forces killed Hamas's [[Ismail Abu Shanab]] on August 21. After the killing of the two high-ranking leaders, Hamas eventually called off the ''hudna''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2003/08/23/a-drug-for-the-addict/ |title=A Drug for the Addict The End of the Hudna |last=Avnery |first=Uri |date=August 23, 2003 |work=[[CounterPunch]] |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2004, senior Hamas leader [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi]] offered a 10-year ''hudna'' in return for complete withdrawal from all territories captured in the [[Six-Day War]], the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, and the unlimited "right of return" for all Palestinian refugees into Israel. Rantissi gave interviews with European reporters and said the ''hudna'' was limited to ten years and represented a decision by the movement because it was "difficult to liberate all our land at this stage; the hudna would however not signal a recognition of the state of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.eircom.net/content/reuters/worldnews/2416620?view=Eircomnet |title=Israel scorns Hamas 10-year truce plan |last=Tostevin |first=Matthew |date=January 26, 2004 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=November 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040306192510/http://home.eircom.net/content/reuters/worldnews/2416620?view=Eircomnet |archivedate=March 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas later repudiated the offer when mentioning it to Arabic media outlets, saying they would never compromise with Israel and would keep fighting until their goals were met; Israel ignored Hamas' posturing since the demand for a Palestinian "right of return" was not going to be granted under any circumstances. [[Ian Lustick]] tried in 2010 to revive the hudna notion in an article posted on the Forbes website where he said Israel needed to negotiate with Hamas, but Lustick misrepresented the terms of the hudna, first by claiming it was supposed to last for a generation (25 years) and by presenting it as a comparative model for the relationship that Israeli Arabs have with Israel's Jewish majority, which left out the specifics of the plan wherein Israel would be replaced by a Muslim-majority "Palestine" under its implementation (a concept Lustick would write in support of for the ''New York Times'' in 2013).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

'''John Randolph Tucker''' (December 24, 1823 – February 13, 1897) was an American lawyer, author, and politician from [[Virginia]]. From a distinguished slaveholding family, he was elected Virginia's attorney general in 1857 and after re-election served during the [[American Civil War]] ([[James S. Wheat]] served as attorney general in Union-held portions of the state). After a pardon and [[Congressional Reconstruction]], Tucker was elected as U.S. Congressman (1875-1887), and later served as the first dean of the [[Washington and Lee University Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;https://law.wlu.edu/about-wandl-law/leadership/aba-presidents Biography at Washington &amp; Lee Law School&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CongBio|T000401&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Tucker was born in [[Winchester, Virginia]] on Christmas eve in 1823, the son of Anna Evalina Hunter Tucker (1789-1855) and her husband Judge [[Henry St. George Tucker, Sr.|Henry St. George Tucker]] (1780-1848). A grandson of [[St. George Tucker]], J.R. Tucker would become proud of his heritage among the [[First Families of Virginia]]. His father and many relatives owned plantations and enslaved persons. Nonetheless, several of his siblings never reached adulthood. His brothers Dr. Alfred Bland Tucker (1830-1862) and Lt.Col. St. George Hunter Tucker (1828-1863) would die of consumption while in the [[Confederate States Army]]; his brother Dr. [[David Hunter Tucker]] (1815-1871) became a professor at three medical schools including the [[Medical College of Virginia]] and survived his Confederate service. His brother [[Nathaniel Beverley Tucker (journalist)|Nathaniel Beverley Tucker]] (1820-1890) would become a Confederate diplomat and later a journalist.

John Randolph Tucker attended a private school near his Winchester home, then entered the [[Richmond Academy]]. He finished his studies at the [[University of Virginia]], graduating with a legal degree in 1844.

He married Laura Powell in 1848. They had one son who survived to adulthood, [[Henry St. George Tucker, III]] (who later became a U.S. Congressman). Their daughters who married well and survived their parents included: Anne Holmes Tucker McGuire (1850 - 1914), Gertrude Tucker Logan (1856 - 1925), and Laura Randolph Tucker Pendleton (1860 - 1946).

==Early legal and political career==
John Randolph Tucker was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1845, and began a private legal practice in [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]]. In 1854 he delivered a major speech to the literary societies at [[College of William and Mary]] which argued that slavery was consistent with republicanism.  He also became active in politics and was a presidential elector on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] ticket in 1852 and 1856.

==American Civil War==
Voters elected Tucker  [[State Attorney General|Attorney General]] of the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] in 1857, and he served during the [[American Civil War]], until the Commonwealth surrendered to Union forces in 1865. His siblings also actively supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cause, two as Confederate doctors, Nathaniel Beverley Tucker as a Confederate diplomat, and his lawyer brother St. George Hunter Tucker recruited the Ashland Grays (part of the [[15th Virginia Infantry]]) and served at Lt. Col., winning plaudits for his conduct at the [[Battle of Malvern Hill]] before resigning his commission and dying of consumption in Charlottesville in 1863.

==Postwar legal and political career==

J. Randolph Tucker received a pardon and resumed his private legal practice.

Elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] as a Democrat in 1875, he served until 1887. He was chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Committee on Ways and Means]] in the [[46th United States Congress|46th Congress]] and chairman of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]] in the [[48th United States Congress|48th]] and [[49th United States Congress|49th]] Congresses.

He took an active part in the debates on the [[tariff]], in opposition to the protective policy. His speeches on other questions include those on the [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] bill, the constitutional doctrine as to the presidential count, the Hawaiian treaty in 1876, the use of the army at the polls, in 1879, and Chinese emigration, in 1883. He introduced legislation broadening the power of the federal [[Court of Claims (United States)|Court of Claims]] to hear Constitutional claims in 1886, which became known as the [[Tucker Act]]. He declined to be renominated to the House in 1886. He was co-sponsor of the 1887 [[Edmunds–Tucker Act]].

Tucker was an exemplar of the racist views of his day. Speaking on the House floor, he asserted that “We did not ordain and establish this Constitution for the Chinaman and for all the other races of the earth. . . . I hold that this Constitution was ordained and established by our fathers for their posterity of the Caucasian people of America.”&lt;ref&gt;13 Cong. Rec. Appendix 56&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, he was also not supportive of the post-Civil War push to grant rights to African Americans, declaring that “. . . there is not a philosophical statesman in this land who to-day does not say either that the citizenship and the voting power of the African race in the South is a failure--either that or that it is an unsolved problem of our future. We have that one disease in the body-politic, which God grant we may recover from.”&lt;ref&gt;13 Cong. Rec. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electoral History===
*'''1874'''; Tucker was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives with 65.23% of the vote, defeating Republican [[J. Foote Johnson]].
*'''1876'''; Tucker was re-elected with 59.61% of the vote, defeating Republican [[George H. Burch]].
*'''1878'''; Tucker was re-elected with 63.42% of the vote, defeating Independent Democrat [[Camm Patterson]] and Independent [[Lewis W. Cabell]].
*'''1880'''; Tucker was re-elected with 59.56% of the vote, defeating Readjuster [[James A. Frazier]] and Republican [[David J. Woodfin]].
*'''1882'''; Tucker was re-elected with 54.95% of the vote, defeating Readjuster [[Henry J. Rives]] and Republican Woodfin.
*'''1884'''; Tucker was re-elected, but to [[Virginia's 10th congressional district]]

==Later legal and academic career==
Tucker made an unsuccessful but legally influential argument on behalf of [[August Spies]] and the other [[Haymarket Riot]] defendants during their appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Elected [[professor]] of [[Constitutional law]] at [[Washington and Lee University]] in 1888, Tucker was [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Washington and Lee University School of Law|School of Law]] from 1893 to 1897. Tucker served as president of The [[Virginia Bar Association]] in 1891-1892, and president of the [[American Bar Association]] in 1894.

==Death and legacy==
John Randolph Tucker died in 1897 in [[Lexington, Virginia]] and is buried in the family plot at [[Mount Hebron Cemetery and Gatehouse|Mt. Hebron cemetery]] in Winchester. His widow would join him in 1916. One of his sons, [[Henry St. George Tucker, III]], would follow in his footsteps by becoming Dean of the Washington and Lee Law School, and later a U.S. Congressman representing Winchester (1922-1932).  J.R.Tucker's two volume treatise, ''The Constitution of the United States'', appeared posthumously in 1899.  His Lexington home, [[Blandome]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1323">In '''''L. Taylor v AE Pim''''', an important case in the [[South African law of succession]], the deceased was a [[widow]] who hired a man, Pim, to assist with her business after her [[husband]] died. She subsequently began [[courting|dating]] the man; she also started developing severe [[alcoholism]]. In terms of her [[Will and testament|will]], Pim was to be the sole [[heir]] of her [[assets]].

Shortly before the deceased’s death, she and Pim were on [[vacation|holiday]] together. When the deceased fell ill, Pim refused to allow the hotel in which they were staying to call a doctor for her. Finally, they insisted it was their duty to call one, who duly arrived. Due to the doctor's late arrival, however, she died.

The [[court of law|court]] held that, although Pim had not caused her death, he had allowed the [[Testator|testatrix]] to lead an immoral life, and was the one who had encouraged her [[alcohol abuse]]; therefore, he was unworthy to inherit from her estate.

The '''Local Government Act, 2001''' (No. 37 of 2001) was enacted by the [[Oireachtas]] of [[Ireland (state)|Ireland]] on 21 July 2001.  Most of the provisions of the Act came into operation on 1 January 2002. The act was a restatement and amendment of previous legislation, which  was centred on the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]]. The 2001 act remains in force, although significantly amended by the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]].

According to the explanatory memorandum issued before the passing of the Act, its purposes were to:
*enhance the role of the elected member,
*support community involvement with local authorities in a more participative local democracy,
*modernise local government legislation, and provide the framework for new financial management systems and other procedures to promote efficiency and effectiveness,
*underpin generally the programme of local government renewal.

==Local government areas==
The Act established local government areas based on those already created by previous legislation.  The types of areas listed in the Act are:

'''Counties''': Identical to the administrative counties established by the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] and modified by later legislation.  The opportunity was taken to rename Tipperary (North Riding) and Tipperary (South Riding) as [[North Tipperary]] and [[South Tipperary]] respectively.

'''Cities''': These were the [[County borough]]s created by the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898|1898 Act]] and later legislation, renamed.  All the county boroughs except Galway had previously had the courtesy title of [[city]] by charter or letters patent.

'''Boroughs''': The five existing non-county boroughs continued in existence.  In addition it was recognised that [[Kilkenny]] could continue to be called a city, in spite of being governed by a borough council and not being a former county borough.

'''Towns''': The remaining town authorities, formerly known as [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s or towns with [[Town Commissioners|town commissioners]], were all redesignated as towns.

==Local authorities==
A council was established for each of the local government areas with the title [[county council]], city council, borough council, or [[Town Councils in the Republic of Ireland|town council]] (as appropriate).

==Membership of councils==
One of the most controversial aspects of the Act was the abolition of the so-called "[[dual mandate]]". This meant that members of the [[Oireachtas]] ([[Dáil Éireann]] and [[Seanad Éireann]]) could no longer be candidates for local authority elections. This was taken out of the original act after protests from [[Fianna Fáil]] [[backbencher]]s who were also councillors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/no-political-will-to-rock-the-cosy-boat-that-is-the-seanad-502066.html |title=No political will to rock the cosy boat that is the Seanad |last=Murphy |first=John A |date=14 July 2002|work=Sunday Independent |quote=The councillor lobby which stymied Noel Dempsey's plans to end the dual mandate |accessdate=16 April 2010|location=Dublin }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced in a 2003 amendment after a compensation package was agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0017/print.html#sec2 |title=Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003 |date=June 2, 2003 |series=[[Irish Statute Book]] |chapter=§2 Amendment of Principal Act — insertion of new section 13A |accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/news-in-brief-215369.html |title=Local government needs independent 'fiscal autonomy' |last=Geaney |first=Louise |date=2 June 2003 |work=Irish Independent |quote=The Local Government Bill 2000 proposed to abolish the dual mandate but the Act dropped the idea, only for it to be re-introduced — with a handy €12,800 sweetener — in 2003. |accessdate=16 April 2010 |location=Dublin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directly-elected mayors===
Inspired by the office of [[Mayor of London]] created in 2000, Chapter 3 of Part 5 of the 2001 act as passed provided for a [[Direct election|directly-elected]] chairperson (mayor or ''cathaoirleach'') of each county and city council. This was to take effect from the [[Irish local elections, 2004|2004 local elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2001071000007#N24|title=Local Government Bill, 2000: Second Stage|last=Wallace|first=Danny|date=10 July 2001|work=Seanad Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|pages=Vol.167 No.14 p.7 c.1339 |nopp=Y |quote=From 2004, the cathaoirleach of counties and cities will be elected by direct vote of the people and will hold office for the life of the council.|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2003 amendment repealed the provision before it was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cullen|first=Martin| url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2003022600007#N11|title=Local Government Bill 2003: Second Stage|date=26 February 2003|work=Seanad Éireann debates|publisher=Oireachtas|pages=Vol.171 No.12 p.7 c.937 |nopp=Y |quote=the Bill repeals legislative provisions currently in place which provide for the introduction of direct election of cathaoirligh of county–city councils in 2004.

==Local Government Commission==
Part 11 of the Act mandated the establishment of a permanent Local Government Commission to propose changes to local authority areas, local electoral areas, or local authority powers. This part never came into force and was repealed by the 2014 act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/isbc/2001_37.html|title=Local Government Act 2001: Amendments, Commencement, SIs made under the Act|date=20 September 2016|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous practice of ad-hoc committees for boundary reviews continued after 2001 and was formalised by the 2014 act.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4463">The '''Marine Insurance Act 1745''' (19 Geo. 2 c.37) was an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]].  The Act has been described as "the first significant statutory intervention in substantive marine insurance law".&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Marine Insurance Legislation |url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=f6ZwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR61&amp;lpg=PR61&amp;dq=Marine+Insurance+Act+1745&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Cbzhx6ku99&amp;sig=6RnZeXCZr9ATPvcjW_ADrV9Y_bQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=un2HVYaPG8Kt-QHAz4GIDw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Marine%20Insurance%20Act%201745&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Informa Law |page=lxi |date= |isbn=9781315816678 |access-date=22 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The purpose of the Act was to put an end to the practice of wagering disguised as insurance upon marine vessels.&lt;ref name=Book /&gt;  Persons who had no commercial interest in a marine cargo would take out a policy of insurance in the marine form, essentially gambling upon whether or not the ship would safely arrive at its destination.  Concern was expressed that, apart from general policies against gambling, this also created a positive incentive for certain parties to overload ships and ensure that they were dispatched in risky condition.

Accordingly, the Act introduced into [[English law]] for the first time the requirement of an "[[insurable interest]]" in the subject matter of a policy of insurance.  This requirement was later replicated for life insurance in the [[Life Assurance Act 1774]].  Neither statute sought to define an insurable interest, and it was not until the decision of the courts in ''Lucena v Craufurd''&lt;ref&gt;(1806) 2 Bos &amp; PNR 269&lt;/ref&gt; in 1806 that an insurable interest was first defined as "A right in the property, or a right derivable out of some contract about the property, which in either case may be lost upon some contingency affecting the possession or enjoyment of the party."&lt;ref&gt;at 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==

The Act is extremely short.  The entire text (including the preamble) is set out below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Law Commission Report on Insurable Interests|publisher=[[Law Commission (England and Wales)]]|page=80|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|WHEREAS it hath been found by Experience, that the making Assurances, Interest or no Interest, or without further Proof of Interest than the Policy, hath been productive of many pernicious Practices, whereby great Numbers of Ships, with their Cargoes, have either been fraudulently lost and destroyed, or taken by the Enemy in Time of War; and such Assurances have encouraged the Exportation of Wooll, and the carrying on many other prohibited and clandestine Trades, which by Means of such Assurances have been concealed, and the Parties concerned secured from Loss, as well to the Diminution of the public Revenue, as to the great Detriment of fair Traders; and by introducing a mischievous kind of Gaming or Wagering, under the Pretence of assuring the Risque on Shipping, and fair Trade, the Institution and laudable Design of making Assurances, hath been perverted; and that which was intended for the Encouragement of Trade and Navigation, has, in many Instances, become hurtful of, and destructive to the same: For Remedy whereof, be it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That from and after the first Day of August one thousand seven hundred and forty-six, no Assurance or Assurances shall be made by any Person or Persons, Bodies Corporate or Politick, on any Ship or Ships belonging to his Majesty, or any of his Subjects, or on any Goods, Merchandizes or Effects laden or to be laden on Board of any such Ship or Ships, Interest or no Interest, or without further Proof or Interest than the Policy, or by way of Gaming or Wagering, or without Benefit of Salvage to the Assurer; and that every such Assurance shall be [[void (law)|null and void]] to all Intents and Purposes.}}

==Repeal==

The Act remained substantively in force until it was incorporated into the [[Marine Insurance Act 1906]].&lt;ref name=Book /&gt;

{{UStaxation}}
'''Misclassification of employees as independent contractors''' in the [[United States]] can occur with respect to tax treatment or the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]].

The U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) reports that the IRS claims to lose millions of dollars in uncollected payroll, [[Social Security (United States)|social security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and unemployment insurance taxes because of misclassification of independent contractors by taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1996/gg96130t.pdf|title=Issues in Classifying Workers as Employees or Independent Contractors: Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Oversight Committee on Ways and Means|last=Gandhi|first=Natwar M.|date=1996-06-20|website=[[United States General Accounting Office]]|format=PDF|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue|Commissioner]] [[Mark W. Everson]] in a statement made November 3, 2005, IRS audits of small businesses organized as corporations increased from 7,294 in 2004 to 17,867 in 2005. [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=150358,00.html]

==Taxation==
Employers must report the incomes of employees and independent contractors using the IRS forms [[Form W-2|W-2]] and [[Form 1099-MISC|1099]], respectively. Employers pay various [[tax]]es (i.e. [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes, [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|unemployment tax]]es, etc.) on the wages of a worker that is classified as an employee. These taxes are generally not paid by the employer on the compensation of a worker classified as an independent contractor. Instead, the contractor is responsible for their employer's share of the taxes when he or she pays self-employment taxes at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasovertimeattorney.com/blog/withholding-for-payroll-taxes-and-misclassifying-workers-as-independent-contractors-why-this-ca.cfm|title=Withholding for Payroll Taxes &amp; Misclassifying Workers as Independent Contractors: Why This Can Hurt You at Tax Time.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classification affects whether a worker can receive unemployment benefits. In many states, independent contractors are not eligible for unemployment benefits because nothing has been paid into the unemployment insurance fund on their behalf. Employers who have no employees are not required to make payments to the unemployment insurance fund (since there is no one to claim benefits).

Workers classified as independent contractors whose contract is terminated can contact their state unemployment agency (for example [[Employment Development Department]] (EDD) in California) and file a claim for unemployment. EDD investigates and determines whether the worker was misclassified, and potentially award unemployment benefits. According to state-level studies, 10% to 20% of employers misclassify at least one worker as an independent contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.epi.org/publication/independent-contractor-misclassification/|title=(In)dependent Contractor Misclassification|work=Economic Policy Institute|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IRS reclassification as an employee occurs where persons claimed as (or claiming to be) [[independent contractors]] are recategorized by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), or by state tax authorities, as [[Form W-2|W-2]] [[employee]]s. The reclassification can result in the imposition of substantial fines, penalties and back-taxes for which the [[employer]] is generally liable.

==Employee vs. independent contractor==
IRS regulations state that a worker is an employee if the employer can control what is to be done and how it is to be done. This was codified in revenue ruling 87-41, and is generally called "the twenty factor test".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15a.pdf|title=Publication 15-A: Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide (for use in 2017)|last=|first=|date=2017-01-05|website=|publisher=Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee|title=Independent Contractor (Self-Employed) or Employee?|website=www.irs.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, if the worker controls the means and method of achieving the required results, leaving the employer with the right only to define the desired result, they are correctly classified as an independent contractor.

Employees and independent contractors have very different benefits. Employees are entitled to the protection of wage and hour laws and are protected from discrimination and retaliation by employers. Employees may be legally entitled to family medical leave and benefits such as medical insurance and pension plans. Employees are entitled to bargain collectively with their employers. Employees are entitled to workers' compensation for job-related injuries and employers must pay into social security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance for their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/employee-benefits|title=Employee Benefits|website=www.irs.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; No benefits or employer tax payments are available to contractors, who must pay for their own benefits and unemployment taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/technology/in-the-sharing-economy-workers-find-both-freedom-and-uncertainty.html|title=In the Sharing Economy, Workers Find Both Freedom and Uncertainty|last=Singer|first=Natasha|date=2014-08-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-09|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service sector employees are more likely than others to be misclassified as independent contractors. Commonly misclassified positions include delivery and taxi drivers, nurses and home health aides, housekeepers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rhdtlaw.com/1099d-employer-liability-independent-contractors-service-sector/|title=Independent Contractors or Employees?

Efforts by firms in the [[sharing economy]] such as [[Uber (company)|Uber]] to maintain independent contractor status for "partners" such as Uber drivers have been questioned.&lt;ref name="Medium42015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://medium.com/matter/what-strippers-can-teach-uber-1f5b15e5b427|title=What Strippers Can Teach Uber|date=April 20, 2015|issue=Medium.com|quote=Many of these companies are built with workers who are not even considered workers at all.

IRS Form SS-8 can be filed with the IRS to request that the agency determine the classification of a worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/technology/sd-fi-labor-blurred-lines-20170807-story.html|title=Who are you, gig worker or employee?|last=Rafter|first=Michelle|date=October 3, 2017|website=|language=en|accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fair Labor Standards Act==
In July 2015, the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] issued new guidelines on worker classification. "A worker who is economically dependent on an employer is suffered or permitted to work by the employer. Thus, applying the economic realities test in view of the expansive definition of "employ" under the Act, most workers are employees under the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]]."&lt;ref name=Weil&gt;{{cite web

In law, the principle of '''''non ultra petita,''''' meaning "not beyond the request" in [[Latin language|Latin]], means that a court may not decide more than it has been asked to.&lt;ref name=Mavroidis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mavroidis|first=Petros C.|title=Remedies in the WTO Legal System: Between a Rock and a Hard Place|journal=European Journal of International Law|year=2000|volume=11|issue=4|url=http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/11/4/554.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the court may not award more to the winning party than it requested.&lt;ref name=Ronen&gt;{{cite book|last=Ronen|first=Yaėl|title=The Law and Practice of the International Court, 1920-2005: The court and the United Nations|year=2006|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|BRILL]]|isbn=978-90-04-15019-5|pages=576|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NaOvnvmN7YgC&amp;pg=PA576}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same principle is expressed in the Latin [[Brocard (law)|brocard]] ''Ne eat iudex ultra petita partium aut breviter ne ultra petita'', often abbreviated to ''ne ultra petita''.

It is closely related to the '''disposition principle''' (also called "principle of party disposition" or "principle of free disposition"), also a traditional feature of continental legal systems. It states that in civil and administrative cases, the parties are free to dispose of their claims – advancing, withholding or withdrawing them as they see fit – and may thereby control the course of the litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t111400eu1.html|title=Board of Appeal decision T 1400/11 of 3 July 2014, point 2|date=August 2014|publisher=European Patent Office|quote=... the entitlement of parties to direct the course of the proceedings themselves ("principle of party disposition")...|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nortel Networks Corporation''' ('''Nortel'''), formerly commonly known as '''Northern Electric''' and '''Northern Telecom''', was a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[telecommunications]] and data [[networking equipment]] manufacturer headquartered in [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It was founded in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] in 1895 as the Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company.  Until an [[antitrust]] settlement in 1949, Northern Electric was owned principally by Bell Canada and the [[Western Electric|Western Electric Company]] of the [[Bell System]], producing large volumes of telecommunication equipment based on licensed Western Electric designs. 

At its height, Nortel accounted for more than a third of the total valuation of all the companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), employing 94,500 people worldwide.&lt;ref name = "Third_of_TSX"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hasselback|first1=Drew|last2=Tedesco|first2=Theresa|title=The fate of once-mighty Nortel's last billions lies in the hands of two men|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2014/09/27/the-fate-of-once-mighty-nortels-last-billions-lies-in-the-hands-of-two-men/|website=financialpost.com|publisher=National Post|accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Nortel filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the United States, triggering a 79% decline of its corporate stock. The bankruptcy case was the [[List of corporate collapses and scandals|largest in Canadian history]], and left pensioners, shareholders and former employees with enormous losses.

=== Origins ===
[[Alexander Graham Bell]] conceived the technical aspects of the telephone and invented it in July 1874,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt; while residing with his parents at their farm in Tutela Heights,&lt;ref name="Patten-Bell"&gt;Patten, William; Bell, Alexander Melville.

(Note: Patten's full name was William Patten, not Gulielmus Patten as credited elsewhere)&lt;/ref&gt; on the outskirts of [[Brantford|Brantford, Ontario]]. He later refined its design at Brantford after producing his first working prototype in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, Elizabeth. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Alexander_Graham_Bell.html?id=lyRQIqrMqXQC ''Alexander Graham Bell: An Inventive Life'']. Toronto: Kids Can Press, 1999, p.14. {{ISBN|1-55074-456-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's first telephone factory, created by James Cowherd of Brantford, was a three-story brick building that soon started manufacturing telephones for the [[Bell System]], leading to the city's style as ''The Telephone City''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, Robert; Canadian Military Heritage Museum. [http://images.ourontario.ca/brant/82662/page/82?n= Soldiers and Warriors: The Early Volunteer Militia of Brant County: 1856-1866], Brantford, ON: [[List of museums in Ontario|Canadian Military Heritage Museum]], 1998, p. 80, ref. citations No. 142 &amp; 143, which in turn cite:

Alexander Graham Bell had originally asked Boston manufacturer Charles Williams to provide an initial order of 1,000 telephones for use in Canada, but Williams' small shop was only able to produce a fraction of that number. Bell then spoke with a Brantford friend, James Cowherd (1849? – Feb. 1881), who set up Canada's first telephone factory which produced 2,398 telephones to Bell's specifications by 1881. Bell sent Cowherd to Boston in 1878 to study Williams manufacturing processes for a number of months; Cowherd then returned to Brantford to produce Bell's production telephones, and help develop newer models. Among Cowherd's designs was a transmitter fitted with a triple mouthpiece allowing three people to talk, and sing, simultaneously. Cowherd's untimely early death from tuberculosis was noted in major technical journals and led to the closure of the Bell Systems' manufacturing supplier plant in Brantford. Telephone production later resumed in Montreal, eventually leading to the creation of Northern Electric, later renamed Northern Telecom and then Nortel.&lt;ref name="B.H.S.-Reville.c"&gt;Reville 1920, p.322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prevey, W.

A ''Brantford Expositor'' article later noted of the historic factory building's demise: "[Brantford] City officials and heritage committee members hung their heads in shame in 1992 when it was learned that a building that once housed the first telephone factory in the world had been approved for demolition. The embarrassing oversight came to light too late to stop wrecking crews, who were already tearing down the aged building at 32 Wharfe St... The building, where equipment for [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s first telephone was made, had even been pictured and written about in a city-printed brochure about the great inventor. A plaque erected by [the] [[Telephone Pioneers of America]] heralding the building's significance had been stripped from the structure in the mid-1980s and given to the Brant County Museum".&lt;ref&gt;Ibbotson, Heather.

After Cowherd's death in 1881 which resulted in the closure of his Brantford factory, a mechanical production department was created within the [[Bell Canada|Bell Telephone Company of Canada]] and production of Canadian telephone equipment was transferred to Montreal in 1882,&lt;ref name="NortelHistory1874-1900" /&gt; to compensate the restrictions on importing telephone equipment from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As the manufacturing branch expanded, its production ability increased beyond the demand for telephones, and it faced closure for several months a year without manufacturing other products.{{sfn|Rens|Roth|2001|p=130}} The Bell Telephone Company of Canada's (later renamed to Bell Canada) charter prohibited the company to build other products. In 1895, the Bell Telephone of Canada spun off its manufacturing arm to build telephones for sale to other companies, as well as other products, such as [[fire alarm]] boxes, [[police box|police street call boxes]], and [[firefighter|fire department call equipment]].

=== Northern Electric Company ===

The construction of a new manufacturing plant started in 1913 at Shearer Street in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, as preparations began for the two manufacturing companies' integration. Then, in January 1914, the Northern Electric and Manufacturing Company and the Imperial Wire and Cable Company merged into the ''Northern Electric Company'', commonly known simply as Northern Electric, and the new company opened the doors on a new manufacturing plant in January 1915. This facility at Shearer Street was the primary manufacturing centre until the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name="NortelHistory1900-1919"/&gt; [[Edward Fleetford Sise]] was the president and his brother [[Paul Fleetford Sise]] was the vice-president and general manager.{{sfn|Rens|Roth|2001|pp=129–132}}

During the [[First World War]] Northern Electric manufactured the [[Portable Commutator]], a one-wire telegraphic switchboard for military operations in the field. In 1922, Northern started to produce, for $5, the "Peanut" vacuum tube, which required only a single dry-cell battery. The use of alternating current was still under development during this time. The "Northern Electric Peanut tube was the smallest tube made, and drew only one-tenth of an ampere and was the most remarkable radio frequency amplifier ever made."&lt;ref&gt;

In July 1923, CHYC-AM was the first radio station to provide entertainment to the riders of the [[Transcontinental railroad|transcontinental train]], in a parlor car fitted with a radio set to receive the broadcast as it left Montreal and traveled west.{{sfn|Rens|Roth|2001|p=197}} Later in the 1920s, Northern created the first [[Sound film|talking movie sound system]] in the [[British Empire]] for a theater in Montreal.&lt;ref name="NortelHistory1920-1929"&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s, Northern Electric was affected, like most other companies. From the beginning of 1930 through the end of 1933, sales dropped from $34 million to $8.2 million, and the number of employees dropped from 6,100 to 2,400.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Independence from Western Electric ===
In 1949, an [[antitrust]] suit in the U.S. forced [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]]/[[Western Electric]] to sell its stake in Northern Electric to Bell Canada. AT&amp;T spun off Northern Electric in 1956. Deprived of its Western Electric tie, Northern began developing its own products. In 1953, Northern Electric produced its first television sets using [[Cathode ray tube|tubes]] made by [[RCA]].&lt;ref name="NortelHistory1950-1959"&gt;{{cite web

Bell Canada acquired 100 percent of Northern Electric in 1964; through public stock offerings starting in 1973, Bell's ownership of Northern Electric and its successors would be reduced, though it continued to have majority control.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 1966, the Northern Electric research lab, Northern Electric Laboratories (the predecessor to [[Bell-Northern Research]]), started looking into the possibilities of [[Optical fiber|fiber optic cable]], and in 1969, began work on digitizing telephone communications. Also in 1969, Northern began making inroads into the U.S. market with its switching systems. In 1972, it opened its first factory in the U.S. in [[Michigan]]. In 1975, Northern began shipping its first [[Telephone switch#Digital switches|digital switching systems]], one of the earliest such systems to be sold.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Northern Telecom was, with Bell-Northern Research, in the early 1970s a part owner of [[MicroSystems International]] a semiconductor manufacturer based in Nepean, outside Ottawa.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

=== Northern Telecom and "Digital World" ===
{{Peacock|section|date=May 2012}}
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:northerntelecom.png|155|left|Old Northern Telecom (Nortel) logo]] --&gt;

In 1976, the company name was changed to Northern Telecom Limited, and management announced its intention to concentrate the company's efforts on digital technology. Northern Telecom was the first company in its industry to announce and to deliver a complete line of fully digital telecommunications products. The product line was branded "Digital World" and included the well known [[DMS-100]], a fully digital central office switch serving as many as 100,000 lines, which was a key contributor to the company's revenue for close to 15 years.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Starting in 1977, Nortel grew rapidly after the introduction of its DMS line of digital central office telephone switches, especially after the [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]] breakup in 1984. Northern Telecom became a significant supplier in Europe and China {{citation needed|date=May 2012}} and was the first non-Japanese supplier to [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]].

=== Deregulation ===

In 1983, due to deregulation, Bell Canada Enterprises (later shortened to [[Bell Canada Enterprises|BCE]]) was formed as the parent company to [[Bell Canada]] and Northern Telecom. [[Bell-Northern Research]] was jointly owned 50–50 by Bell Canada and Northern Telecom. The combined three companies were referred to as the tricorporate.&lt;ref name="BellSystemMemorial"&gt;{{cite web

As Nortel, the streamlined identity it adopted for its 100th anniversary in 1995, the company set out to dominate the burgeoning [[globalization|global market]] for [[Public Switched Telephone Network|public]] and private networks.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

=== Optical boom and the Right Angle Turn ===

In 1998, with the acquisition of [[Bay Networks]], the company's name was changed to Nortel Networks to emphasize its ability to provide complete solutions for multiprotocol, multiservice, global networking over the [[Internet]] and other communications networks. As a consequence of the stock transaction used to purchase Bay Networks, BCE ceased to be the majority shareholder of Nortel.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

In 2000, BCE [[spin-out#U.S. SEC definition|spun out]] Nortel, distributing its holdings of Nortel to its shareholders. Bell-Northern Research was gradually absorbed into Nortel, as it first acquired a majority share in BNR, and eventually acquired the entire company.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

In the late 1990s, stock market [[speculation|speculators]], hoping that Nortel would reap increasingly lucrative profits from the sale of fibre optic network gear, began pushing up the company's share price to unheard-of levels despite the company's repeated failure to turn a profit. Under the leadership of CEO [[John Roth (businessman)|John Roth]], sales of optical equipment had been robust in the late 1990s, but the market was soon saturated. When the speculative telecom [[Dot-com bubble|bubble of the late 1990s]] reached its pinnacle late in the year 2000, Nortel was to become one of the most spectacular casualties.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

At its height, Nortel accounted for more than a third of the total valuation of all the companies listed on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] (TSX), employing 94,500 worldwide, with 25,900 in Canada alone.&lt;ref name = "Third_of_TSX" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wahl |first=Andrew |title=The good, the bad and the ugly: Nortel Networks |url=http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/article/canadianbusiness/1037/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-nortel-networks |date=March 24, 2009 |magazine=Canadian Business |accessdate=July 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330143912/http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/article/canadianbusiness/1037/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-nortel-networks |archivedate=March 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nortel's market capitalization fell from [[Canadian dollar|C$]]398 billion in September 2000 to less than C$5 billion in August 2002, as Nortel's stock price plunged from C$124 to C$0.47. When Nortel's [[stock market crash|stock crashed]], it took with it a wide swath of Canadian investors and [[pension fund]]s and left 60,000 Nortel employees unemployed. Roth was criticized after it was revealed that he cashed in his own [[stock option]]s for a personal gain of C$135 million in 2000 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://secure.globeadvisor.com/servlet/ArticleNews/story/gam/20050112/RNORTBOARD12 |title=New board 'is an improvement by a mile' |work=Globe and Advisor|date=January 12, 2005 |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief financial officer [[Frank Dunn]] was eventually chosen as Roth's permanent replacement.

=== After the Internet bubble ===

==== Accounting restatements ====

Frank Dunn presided over a dramatic restructuring of Nortel, which included laying off two-thirds of its workforce (60,000 staff) and writedowns of nearly US$16 billion in 2001 alone. This had some initial perceived success in turning the company around, with an unexpected return to profitability reported in the first quarter of 2003. The black ink triggered a total of $70 million in bonuses to the top 43 managers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/no-business-reason-to-release-nortel-reserves-court-told/article2309645/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Janet | last=McFarland | title=No business reason to release Nortel reserves, court told| date=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with $7.8 million going to Dunn alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/article/1117383--nortel-trial-letters-show-nortel-execs-knew-they-were-getting-bonuses-fraudulently-crown-alleges | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Michael | last=Lewis | title=Nortel trial: Letters show Nortel execs knew they were getting bonuses fraudulently, Crown alleges | date=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; $3 million to chief financial officer [[Douglas Beatty]], and $2 million to controller [[Michael Gollogly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20120118/nortel-exec-fraud-trial-120118/#ixzz1jrHQEEzQ |title=Nortel execs were getting bonuses fraudulently: Crown &amp;#124; |work = CTV News |date=January 18, 2012 |accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent auditor [[Deloitte &amp; Touche]] advised audit committee chairman [[John Cleghorn]] and board chairman [[Lynton Wilson|"Red" Wilson]] to look into the suspicious results, who promptly hired the law firm WilmerHale to vet the financial statements.&lt;ref name="Nortel Nailed Coffin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Accounting scandal another nail in Nortel coffin|url=http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=2173704|accessdate=July 7, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222095656/http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=2173704|archivedate=February 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late October 2003, Nortel announced that it intended to restate approximately $900 million of liabilities carried on its previously reported balance sheet as of June 30, 2003, following a comprehensive internal review of these liabilities. The company stated that the restatement's principal effects would be a reduction in previously reported net losses for 2000, 2001, and 2002 and an increase in shareholders’ equity and net assets previously reported on its balance sheet. A dozen of the company's most senior executives returned $8.6 million of bonuses they were paid based on the erroneous accounting. Investigators ultimately found about $3 billion in revenue had been booked improperly in 1998, 1999, and 2000. More than $2 billion was moved into later years, about $750 million was pushed forward beyond 2003 and about $250 million was wiped away completely. The accounting scandal hurt both Nortel's reputation and finances, as Nortel spent an estimated US$400 million on outside auditors and management consultants to retrain staff.&lt;ref name="Nortel Nailed Coffin"/&gt;

To improve its liquidity, in 2003 Nortel arranged a US$750 million credit support facility with [[Export Development Canada]].&lt;ref name="2003-EDC"&gt;{{Cite press release | title = Nortel Networks Announces US$750 Million Support Facility with EDC and Details of Special Matters to be Considered at Upcoming Shareholders Meeting | publisher = Nortel Networks Corporation | date = February 14, 2003 | url = http://www.nortel.com/corporate/news/newsreleases/2003a/02_14_03_edc_credit_facility.html | accessdate = December 9, 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061228171135/http://www.nortel.com/corporate/news/newsreleases/2003a/02_14_03_edc_credit_facility.html | archivedate = December 28, 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Robinson of the [[Canadian Taxpayers Federation]] denounced the line of credit, calling it "corporate welfare at its worst."&lt;ref name="SunMedia-EDC2003"&gt;{{Cite news | last = McKibbon | first = Sean | title = Bailout Billion; Taxpayers to prop up mega-loser Nortel | newspaper = Winnipeg Sun | location = Winnipeg | page = 8 | publisher = Sun Media | date = February 16, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[LG Electronics]] and Nortel formed a [[joint venture]] in August, with Nortel owning 50% plus one share, to offer telecom and networking solutions in the wireline, optical, wireless and enterprise areas for South Korean and global customers.

[[Peter W. Currie]], previously the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the [[Royal Bank of Canada]], was named CFO of Nortel in 2005, having previously served as Northern Telecom's CFO in the 1990s. [[Gary Daichendt]], the former Chief Operating Officer of [[Cisco Systems]], was hired as President and COO, and was expected to succeed Owens as CEO. Shortly afterward, Daichendt appointed ex-Cisco Chief Science Officer [[Gary Kunis]] as Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Both Garys were concerned about the overall direction of Nortel, especially when compared to Cisco, their previous employer. Just three months later, Daichendt resigned after both his restructuring plan and his suggestion that Owens and Currie leave the company immediately were rejected by the board of directors. Kunis quit shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/related/links/story.html?id=2180163 ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the year's end, directors Lynton "Red" Wilson and John Cleghorn retired from the board.

[[Mike S. Zafirovski]], who had served as President and CEO of [[General Electric|GE Lighting]] and then as [[Motorola]] President and COO, succeeded Owens as president and CEO on November 15, 2005.&lt;ref name="MW-Zafirovski"&gt;{{cite press release

&lt;/ref&gt; Motorola filed a suit against Zafirovski's hiring, alleging that his new position would break the terms of the [[non-disclosure agreement]] he had signed. Nortel agreed to pay $11.5 million on his behalf to settle the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="SUITSETTLE"&gt;{{cite web |last = McMillan|first = Robert|title = Motorola, Nortel settle Zafirovski dispute|work = infoworld.com|url = http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/10/31/HNmotorolanortel_1.html|accessdate = September 5, 2006 |date=October 31, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nortel also paid out US$575 million and 629 million common shares in 2006 to settle a class-action lawsuit that accused the company of misleading investors about the company's health.

Currie stepped down as Executive Vice President and CFO in early 2007. In February 2007, Nortel announced its plans to reduce its workforce by 2,000 employees, and to transfer an additional 1,000 jobs to lower-cost job sites. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against Nortel for accounting fraud from 2000 to 2003; the fraud was allegedly to close gaps between its true performance, its internal targets and Wall Street expectations. Nortel settled the case, paying $35 million, which the Commission distributed to affected shareholders, and reported periodically to the Commission on remedial measures to improve its financial accounting.

Nortel announced plans in February 2008 to eliminate 2,100 jobs, and to transfer another 1,000 jobs to lower-cost centres.&lt;ref name="CBC-200802-jobcuts"&gt;{{cite news|work=CBC News |title=Nortel cutting 2,100 jobs |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=February 27, 2008 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2008/02/27/nortel-jobs.html |accessdate=June 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606023743/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2008/02/27/nortel-jobs.html |archivedate=June 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its reporting of third quarter 2008 results, Nortel announced it would restructure into three vertically-integrated business units: Enterprise, Carrier Networks, and Metro Ethernet Networks. As part of the decentralization of its organization, four executive positions were eliminated, effective January 1, 2009: Chief Marketing Officer - Lauren Flaherty; Chief Technology Officer - John Roese; Global Services President - Dietmar Wendt; and Executive Vice President Global Sales - Bill Nelson. A net reduction of 1,300 jobs was also announced.&lt;ref name="PR-Nortel2008Q3"&gt;{{cite press release

In February 2010, [[Ernst &amp; Young]], the court-appointed monitor of Nortel's Canadian bankruptcy proceedings, reported that the assets of Nortel's [[Health and Welfare Trust]] had a shortfall of $37 million in its net assets as of December 31, 2008. The trust supports pensioners' medical, dental and life insurance benefits, as well as income support for some groups such as long-term disability recipients.&lt;ref name="OttawaCitizen-HWT"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hill |first=Bert |title=Nortel leaves $37M health-fund gap |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=February 23, 2010 |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/life/Nortel+leaves+health+fund/2600350/story.html |accessdate=January 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308055344/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/life/Nortel%2Bleaves%2Bhealth%2Bfund/2600350/story.html |archivedate=March 8, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in February, Nortel negotiated a $57-million deal to wind up the health care and other benefits provided to former Canadian employees.

== Criticism and controversy ==

=== Billions go to lawyers and accountants ===
In 2016 the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], reported that lawyers and accountants received $2.5 billion from Nortel's estate&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/nortel-bankruptcy-disability-benefits-1.3796332&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hackers had free access for years without being detected ===
{{See also|Julian Assange#Hacking_and_conviction}}

In September 1991, [[Julian Assange]] of [[WikiLeaks]] was discovered in the act of hacking into the Melbourne master terminal of Nortel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Khatchadourian |first=Raffi |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/06/07/100607fa_fact_khatchadourian?currentPage=all |title=WikiLeaks and Julian Paul Assange |work=The New Yorker |date=June 7, 2010 |accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, it was discovered that [[cracker (computer security)|crackers (malicious hackers)]] gained almost complete access to Nortel's systems. Beginning in 2000, for nearly ten years they accessed documents including emails, technical papers, research, development reports, and business plans. The breach was not properly addressed by the time the company started selling some of its assets in 2009, following a bankruptcy filing. The Wall Street Journal reports that hackers working from Chinese IP addresses had used seven passwords of Nortel executives, including a former CEO, to penetrate networks owned by the company.&lt;ref name="Wall-Street-Hacker" /&gt;

[[Brian Shields]], a former systems security advisor for Nortel, led an internal investigation into the breach and exposed [[rootkit]] software on at least two machines in 2009 that allowed hackers to control them remotely and monitor email. Despite the original discovery in 2004 and the subsequent investigation that led to the rootkit detection in 2009, Nortel allegedly ignored the problem and failed to disclose it to potential buyers of its business. [[Avaya]] and [[Genband]] both acquired parts of Nortel, and some employees used old Nortel machines connected to the new companies' networks. Although Avaya says it has dealt with the issue, Shields says "it's despicable that Nortel didn't say anything," leaving it up to him to inform the new company of his investigation. Nortel refused to comment on The Wall Street Journal report, but former CEO [[Mike Zafirovski]], in charge between 2005 and 2009, claimed the company "did not believe it was a real issue."&lt;ref name="Wall-Street-Hacker"&gt;{{cite news

=== Government bailouts ===

==== 2003 ====

On February 16, 2003, the [[Winnipeg Sun]] published an article criticising the Canadian Federal government for propping up "mega-loser Nortel" through Export Development Canada (EDC). The article interviewed Walter Robinson of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation who termed this EDC support as "corporate welfare at its worst.". Mr Robinson was appalled that Canadians who already lost billions on Nortel on the stock market would be asked for even more money through their taxes to support Nortel.&lt;ref name="SunMedia-EDC2003"/&gt;

==== 2009 ====

EDC had agreed to provide up to $30 million in short-term financing through an existing bonding facility. The Canadian government resisted characterizing its position on Nortel as a bailout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idCAN1446286920090114 | work=Reuters | first=Randall | last=Palmer | title=UPDATE 2-Canada government pledges to help Nortel | date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illegal breach of trust in Nortel's Health and Welfare Trust ===

There have been reports of financial irregularities at Nortel's Health and Welfare Trust. [[Diane Urquhart]], a financial analyst, testified before a parliamentary committee that $100 million is missing from the HWT and that a $37 million loan to the corporation has not been paid back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parlvuvod.parl.gc.ca/StreamLogger/2010/2010-03/000178b2.wmv Standing committee on Finance hearings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906000922/http://parlvuvod.parl.gc.ca/StreamLogger/2010/2010-03/000178b2.wmv |date=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The HWT was an unregistered trust maintained by Nortel to provide medical, dental, life insurance, long-term disability and survivor income and pension transition benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://documentcentre.eycan.com/eycm_library/Project%20Copperhead/English/Court%20Orders/77.%20Settlement%20Agreement%20Order/EndorsementSettlement.pdf Superior Court of Justice&amp;nbsp;– Ontario Endorsement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331035546/http://documentcentre.eycan.com/eycm_library/Project%20Copperhead/English/Court%20Orders/77.%20Settlement%20Agreement%20Order/EndorsementSettlement.pdf |date=March 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101209/OTT_Nortel_101209/20101209/?hub=OttawaHome |title=Senate kills bill that would help disabled Nortel workers |work=CTV News |date=December 9, 2010 |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Until 2005 Nortel fully funded the disability insurance in its HWT. However, it is alleged that since then, the HWT [[Governance Committees]] and third party [[trustee]], [[Northern Trust]], breached their [[fiduciary]] duties to protect Nortel's disabled employees and survivors of deceased employees by allowing Nortel to misdirect over $100 million from the HWT for purposes inconsistent with the terms of the HWT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ismymoneysafe.org/pdf/SystemicFailureofEmployerSponsoredDisabilityInsurance.pdf |title=Systemic Failure of Employer Sponsored Disability Insurance |access-date=February 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000105/http://ismymoneysafe.org/pdf/SystemicFailureofEmployerSponsoredDisabilityInsurance.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of March 1, 2012, Northern Trust continues to act as the paying agent for Canadian [[Nortel Retirees and former employees Protection Canada|Nortel pensioners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmlaw.ca/Case-Central/Overview/Status-Of-Case/?rid=107 |first=Koskie |last=Minsky LLP |title=Nortel Networks Corporation&amp;nbsp;– Developments |publisher=Kmlaw.ca |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bookkeeping irregularities ===
In 2007, both the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] and the [[Ontario Securities Commission]] laid charges against former senior financial officials from Nortel including Frank Dunn who was fired from Nortel in 2004. Frank Dunn was promoted from [[chief financial officer]] to replace John A. Roth as [[CEO]] in November 2001. According to the SEC, Dunn and three other financial officers began to fudge revenue by misusing "[[bill and hold]]" transactions starting "no later than September, 2000". The SEC said that at least a year's worth of the alleged book-keeping took place while John Roth was still CEO of Nortel, even though no charges were laid against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/ex-nortel-ceo-john-roth-says-hes-cleared/article87339/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Boyd | last=Erman | title=Ex-Nortel CEO John Roth says he's cleared&amp;nbsp;– The Globe and Mail | date=March 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070312.rnortelroth0312/BNStory/Front |title=Unknown |work=The Globe and Mail |date=March 12, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2011 |location=Toronto }} {{Dead link|date=September 2013|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}{{subscription required|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment of Nortel pensioners ===

On June 23, 2010, the News and Observer published a story criticizing treatment pensioners have been receiving from their former employer, Nortel. According to the article, Nortel has asked a federal court to terminate medical coverage, prescription drug coverage, long-term disability, and life insurance of 4,000 retirees and dependents, claiming the benefits are costing the company $2 million per month. Nortel blamed the company's creditors for this decision.&lt;ref name="Triagle"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nortel ex-CEO files as a creditor seeking $1 billion from the proceeds of bankruptcy ===

In the middle of the decade several class-action lawsuits were filed against John Roth and others, by former employees who felt that their 401K company plans were depleted due to misrepresentation by the defendants. They claimed they were duped into investing in Nortel stock, when those who encouraged them to do so allegedly knew that the company was ailing. John Roth left Nortel in 2001 with more than $130 million.

In 2009, Mr. Roth filed a claim for $1 billion, aiming to become a creditor to the assets of Nortel along with all other Nortel employees, in case the class action lawsuits against him succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2009/12/17/nortel-john-roth-lawsuits.html#ixzz17Fo2R8fU |work=CBC News |date=December 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317143902/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2009/12/17/nortel-john-roth-lawsuits.html |archivedate=March 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Roth Wants Nortel's Help! |first=Mark |last=Evans |date=December 18, 2009 |url=http://www.allaboutnortel.com/2009/12/18/john-roth-wants-nortels-help/ |accessdate=December 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707113446/http://www.allaboutnortel.com/2009/12/18/john-roth-wants-nortels-help/ |archivedate=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflicts of interest ===

During Nortel's 2002 annual [[shareholders' meeting]] held in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], several [[shareholder]]s (including [[Robert Verdun]]) complained about non-arms-length relationships with service providers such as director [[Yves Fortier (lawyer)|Yves Fortier]], who provided legal services to Nortel while sitting on its board, and Nortel's auditors, [[Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP]], who were paid $15 million for non-auditing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=14491 |title=Shareholders Blast Nortel&amp;nbsp;– Telecom News Analysis |publisher=Light Reading |date= |accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2301">'''''Orange-Book-Standard''''' (Az. KZR 39/06) is a decision issued on May 6, 2009 by the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] ({{lang-de|Bundesgerichtshof}}, BGH) on the interaction between [[patent law]] and [[technical standard|standards]], and more generally between [[intellectual property law]] and [[competition law]]. The Court held that a defendant, accused of [[patent infringement]] and who was not able to obtain a [[Licensing#Intellectual_property|license]] from the patentee, may defend himself, under certain conditions, by invoking an [[Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|abuse of a dominant market position]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Straus]], [http://jeclap.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/3/189 "Patent Application: Obstacle for Innovation and Abuse of Dominant Position under Article 102 TFEU?"], Journal of European Competition Law &amp; Practice (2010) 1 (3): 189-201, footnote 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Orange-Book-Standard" comes from the [[Rainbow Books|Orange Book]] that contained the format specifications for [[CD-R]]s, the technology at issue in the case that led to the Orange-Book-Standard decision.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Schweizer, [http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2010/03/dutch-see-orange-book-differently.html "Dutch see Orange Book differently; Philips prevails again"], IPKat, March 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US-CopyrightOffice-Seal.svg|thumb|Seal of the United States Copyright Office]]

An [[orphan work]] is a [[copyright]]ed work whose owner is impossible to identify or contact.&lt;ref name=orph-pdf/&gt; This inability to request permission from the copyright owner often means orphan works cannot be used in new works nor digitized, except when [[fair use]] exceptions apply. Until recently, public libraries could not distribute orphaned books without risking being fined up to $150,000 if the owner of the copyright were to come forward.&lt;ref name=varian&gt;{{cite web|last=Varian|first=Hal|title=Copyrights That No One Knows About Don't Help Anyone|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31scene.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This problem was addressed in the 2011 case [[Google Book Search Settlement Agreement|''Authors Guild et al. v. Google'']].

==History==
The [[orphan works]] problem arose in the United States from the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which eliminated the need to register copyrighted works.  Instead, according to {{UnitedStatesCode|17|102}}, all "original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression"&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; are automatically granted copyright protection. This Act made obtaining and maintaining copyright protection substantially easier than the previous [[Copyright Act of 1909]]. It also made unnecessary any central recording system to track and identify copyright-holders, but also made it difficult to find or contact the creator of a copyrighted work if the person or organization was not readily known. Thus, any use of the orphaned work outside of what is permitted as [[fair use]] is potentially a violation of copyright. Potential users of orphaned works are often not willing to take on that risk of copyright violation, so they may individually investigate the copyright status of each work they plan to use.&lt;ref name=varian /&gt;

To some, this scenario is not in the public interest; it limits works that are available to the public. It also discourages the creation of new works that incorporate existing works. Creators who want to use an orphan work are often unwilling to do so for fear that they will have to pay a huge amount of money in damages if the owner ever appears; the risk of additional liability or litigation may be too high. This makes the work of historians, archivists, artists, scholars, and publishers at times more difficult and costly than necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphan Works|url=http://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/orphanworks.html|work=Center for the Study of the Public Domain|publisher=Duke University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The issue arises in Wikipedia, where the copyright owner of a photo that would have illustrated an article may be unknown.

Libraries and archives do have limited privileges to make copies of certain orphan works under section H of {{UnitedStatesCode|17|108}}.

==2006 study by US Copyright Office==
In January 2006, the [[United States Copyright Office]] released a report on orphan works.&lt;ref name=orph-pdf/&gt;  This report was the culmination of a year-long study conducted by the office, based on open forums from the public to collect input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keeley|first=Joe|title=Efforts by the U.S. Copyright Office|url=http://www.orphanworks.net/History/History/CopyrightOffice.html|work=OrphanWorks.net|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In it, the Copyright Office states that new legislation is desperately needed to address the orphan works problem. The report proposed that if a nonprofit organization such as a library used an orphan work and the copyright owner came forward, then the library would be exempt from huge copyright infringement fines as long as it stopped using the orphan work right away. Commercial uses of an orphan work in which the owner came forward would only be charged a "reasonable compensation"&lt;ref name=orph-pdf&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Copyright Office|date=2006|title=Report on Orphan Works|url=http://www.copyright.gov/orphan/orphan-report.pdf|publisher=Register of Copyrights}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the profits, and use of the work would be allowed to continue.&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{cite web|last=Foster|first=Andrea|title=Copyright Office Sides With Publishers in Proposal for Handling 'Orphan' Works|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Copyright-Office-Sides-With/4407|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office's proposed solution is thought to have favored publishers, and disfavored archivists and scholars.&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt;

==Orphan works legislation==
Beginning in May 2006, various legislative bills have been introduced in [[United States Congress|Congress]] aimed at addressing the issue of orphan works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Copyright: Orphan Works| publisher = American Library Association | date = August 2006| url = http://www.ala.org/ala/washoff/WOissues/copyrightb/orphanworks/orphanworks.htm#house22may

In 2018, the Music Modernization Act established a framework for orphan work sound recordings to be used: the user must submit the orphan work to the [[United States Copyright Office]], at which point any copyright holder will be given 90 days to come forward and object to its use. If no rights holder emerges, or if the user successfully establishes the use is a noncommercial [[fair use]] of the recording, the recording may be used freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/new-music-modernization-act-has-major-fix-older-recordings-will-belong-public|title=The New Music Modernization Act Has a Major Fix: Older Recordings Will Belong to the Public, Orphan Recordings Will Be Heard Again|first=Mitch|last=Stoltz|date=19 September 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempts to make orphan works available==
The [[University of Michigan]] (UM) is leading the HathiTrust orphan works project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://orphanworks.hathitrust.org/ orphanworks.hathitrust.org]&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative to make orphan works published between 1923 and 1963 on [[HathiTrust]] available to the UM community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HathiTrust Orphan Works Project Grows as University of California, Others Join Up|work=Library Journal|author=David Rapp|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/community/academiclibraries/891836-419/hathitrust_orphan_works_project_grows.html.csp|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was put on hold as of September 2011 in the wake of a lawsuit filed against HathiTrust, UM, and four other member universities by the Authors Guild, Australian and Canadian authors' organizations, and eight authors to stop them from "reproducing, distributing and/or displaying" copyrighted works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Michigan Puts HathiTrust Orphan Works Project on Hold|author=David Rapp|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/892061-264/university_of_michigan_puts_hathitrust.html.csp|work=Library Journal|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This case was settled in HathiTrust's favor in ''[[Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust]]'' on January 6, 2015.

The [[Internet Archive]] in October 2017 started making available online some orphan works published between 1923 and 1941 included, forming a collection called the "Sonny Bono memorial" (after [[Sonny Bono]], an entertainer and advocate for perpetual copyright for whom the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] was named).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2017-10-14|title=Books from 1923 to 1941 Now Liberated! |publisher= Internet Archive Blogs |url= https://blog.archive.org/2017/10/10/books-from-1923-to-1941-now-liberated/ |website= blog.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effort is made possible by [[17 U.S.C.]] §108(h) when applied according to some actionable criteria proposed by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Townsend|last1=Gard|last2=Elizabeth|title=Creating a Last Twenty (L20) Collection: Implementing Section 108(H) in Libraries, Archives and Museums|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3049158|date=2017-10-02|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political decay''' is a political theory, originally described by [[Samuel P. Huntington]],&lt;ref name=World_Politics&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2009286|author=Huntington, Samuel P.|title=Political Development and Political Decay|journal=World Politics|volume=17|number=3 |year=1965|pages=386–430|doi=10.2307/2009286}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes how chaos and disorder can arise from social modernization increasing more rapidly than political and institutional modernization. Huntington provides different definitions for political development and describes the forms of political decay according to the various definitions. Huntington focuses primarily on political development as modernization and institutionalization. However, he points to the different definitions of political development as being arbitrary ways to understanding the rise of political systems and the relationship between the political systems in different nations.

==Political development==
Huntington identifies two characteristics of political development. The first is that development is synonymous with [[modernization]], thus political development can be defined as political modernization. The second is that there are many criteria to measure political development because modernization and development are such broad topics, covering many areas. There are four generally agreed-upon criteria to determine political development. The first is [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]], which involves the movement from [[Political particularism|particularism]] to [[universalism]], or, from a political standpoint, a focus on functional differentiation and achievement criteria. The second criterion is [[nationalism]], and national integration. This emphasizes nation-states and nation-building as a key aspect of political development. The third criterion is a focus on [[democratization]], which is in essence a focus on competition and equalization of power. The final criterion is [[mobilization]], which is a focus on political participation. The greater the development, the greater the modernization, the greater the mobilization, and therefore the greater the political participation. Ultimately, political development can be defined as an increase in national political unity and an increase in political participation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Modernization===

According to Huntington's definition of political development as modernization, political decay is the opposite of the linear idea of social progress—although, within the model of modernization, social regression is not possible. Instead, political decay takes place because "modern and modernizing states can change by losing capabilities as well as by gaining them. In addition, a gain in any one capability usually involves costs in others."&lt;ref name=World_Politics/&gt;{{rp|393}} The model of modernization was used to compare the political systems of different countries with social development reflecting the linear progression of political institutions.&lt;ref name=World_Politics/&gt;{{rp|391}} However, research into the relationship between development of political institutions and modernization has pointed to inconsistent development. In some political systems, such as certain Latin American regions, governments have been influenced by military intervention as a result of the government's inability to cope with the strains of modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Geller, Daniel S. "Economic Modernization and Political Instability: A Casual Analysis of Bureaucratic-Authoritarianism" ''The Western Political Quarterly'' 35, no. 1 (March 1982): 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional===

Under the framework of political development as institutional development, political decay occurs when institutions fail to change or adapt when they become unnecessary due to social or economic changes. Dan Halvorson challenges the idea of political decay as an institutional failure by claiming that the idea of political decay is tied to a Western ideal of political institution without taking into account widely-varying cultural institutions and the inability of post-colonial states to adapt to Western ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Halvorson, Dan. States of Disorder: ''Understanding State Failure and Intervention in the Periphery''. Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2013. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama refers to political decay as the social and economic forces that upset the equilibrium of established political order.&lt;ref name=Fukuyama&gt;Fukuyama, Francis, The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2011. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions of the Roman Empire government failed to meet the moral and economic needs of the citizens, resulting in the conditions that would facilitate political decay and the fall of the Roman state.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, James Harrington. "Permanence of the American Democracy" ''American Journal of Sociology'' 30, no. 1 (July 1924): 3&lt;/ref&gt; Under the institutional model, political decay can be observed as a decrease in competence and credibility and establishment of institutional corruption over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Crawford. "Zaire: Is There a State?" ''Canadian Journal of African Studies'' 18, no. 1 (1984): 80-82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instability==

Different social and economic factors contribute to both the political development as well as the political decay of nations. Outside forces such as foreign governments affect the stability of established governments due to contrasting social institutions or economic interests. In order to be considered stable, government procedures and institutions must maintain autonomy and be resistant to outside agents.&lt;ref name=World_Politics/&gt;{{rp|402}} The social and economic forces that established political stability could change or disappear, leading to internal instability.&lt;ref name=Fukuyama/&gt; Economic development, such as shifts from agriculture-based economy to manufacturing-based economy, as well as economic collapse, can also lead to political instability. Social developments, such as the proliferation of literacy, lead to the rise and spread of new ideas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Political instability===

Political instability occurs when one faction in a state's government is in opposition with another faction or with another institution in government. Sri Lanka saw a period of political instability following elections in 1994 caused by the ambitions of political leaders. The elected President Kumaratunga attempted to change the constitution and dissolve the parliament in order to remain in power, leading to sudden changes in the structure of the law-making body.&lt;ref&gt;DeVotta, Niel. "Sri Lanka in 2004: Enduring Political Decay and a Failing Peace Process." ''Asian Survey'' 15, no. 1 (January/February 2005: 98-104&lt;/ref&gt; Political instability occurred during the late 18th century in France and other parts of Europe during the 19th century. Political development in France, such as the development of the bureaucracy and other institutions, led to a greater demand for meritocracy and greater political conflict among the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Gillis, John R. "Political Decay and the European Revolutions, 1789-1848." ''World Politics'' 22, no. 3 (April 1970): 344-370.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, political breakdown can occur within the framework of a state's constitution. India has provisions its constitution which grant leaders the power to breach or oppose the constitution in cases of emergency. These breaches of the state law from within the political system can lead to political decay.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Henry C. "The Indian Constitution: Political Development and Decay." ''Asian Survey'' 20, no. 4 (April 1980): 428-451&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social developments===

Huntington's model of political development and decay describes elements such as industrialization, urbanization, education and literacy as social developments that create instability. The presence of violent conflict is not always indicative of social decay. Due to the complex character of state-building and shifts in political systems, violence is not a reliable indicator of political decay or development.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Youssef, Brown, Brian R., Orgnaski, A.F.K. "The Paradoxical Nature of State Making: The Violent Creation of Order." ''The American Political Science Review'' 75, no. 4 (December 1981): 901-910&lt;/ref&gt; The socialization of law is a process by which legislation is changed in order to adapt to economic and social changes. Socialization of law is one of the forces that opposes political decay within Huntington's structure of modernization, by ensuring that the political institutions in place are resistant to social instability.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, James Harrington. "Permanence of the American Democracy." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 30, no. 1 (July 1924): 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Updated by Fukuyama==
Huntington's former student, [[Francis Fukuyama]], has developed the theory of political decay by analysing the sclerosis of democratic institutions in the United States and elsewhere. The second of Fukuyama's two volumes on political order, ''[[Political Order and Political Decay]]'' (2014), echoes the title of Huntington's seminal 1965 essay. Fukuyama focuses on the concept of political decay in the framework of a history of the rise and fall of Chinese dynasties and the causes of political and social stability during each dynasty.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Substantial [[political violence]] existed in [[Germany]] from the fall of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] and the rise of the [[Weimar Republic]] through the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]] until the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] to power in 1933 when a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi totalitarian state]] was formed and opposition figures were arrested.

Due to unrest left from the change of government from a monarchy, based on social standing, to a democratic republic, the people of Germany turned to riots and violence. The drastic change allowed for mobility amongst the classes and new voices to be heard. Many large cities, especially Berlin, experienced political rallies which resulted in violence from opposition. The quick overturn of leaders also influenced crises in the interwar period. Ultimately the National socialists took advantage of the radical setting of Germany but leading to this there was great amounts of political violence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1625">'''Reclusione Militaire''' is a term for time served in a [[military jail]] by members of the [[Italian Armed Forces]].

The term of the sentences that may be served by inmates ranges from a minimum of 1 month to a maximum of 30 years. All service members sentenced must do [[hard labor]] while incarcerated. Anyone sentenced to more than 5 years is discharged from the armed forces and may not return.

Officers who are sentenced and have not been given a [[reduction in rank]] from officer have the right to serve their time in a special section of the military jail.

Article number 26 of the Italian military [[penal code]] discusses this penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Being abolished ( with the law 13 October 1994 n. 589) the death penalty from the Military Penal Code of War, has lost its main raison d'être the practice with which - for three decades - had been ruled out its validity by providing, from time to time by decree-law, the application of the Military Penal Code of Peace in international missions where Italian troops would take part (for peace-keeping or peace-enforcing): {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Improvviso scongelamento per il codice penale militare di guerra |journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2002| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89310156}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Professional responsibility}}
'''Self-dealing''' is the conduct of a [[trustee]], [[Lawyer|attorney]], [[corporate officer]], or other [[fiduciary]] that consists of taking advantage of his position in a transaction and acting in his own interests rather than in the interests of the beneficiaries of the [[Trust law|trust]], corporate [[shareholder]]s, or his clients. According to the political scientist Andrew Stark, "[i]n self-dealing, an officeholder's official role allows her to affect one or more of her own personal interests." It is a form of [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stark|first1=Andrew|title=Conflict of Interest in American Public Life|date=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA and London|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-dealing may involve [[misappropriation]] or [[usurpation]] of [[asset|corporate assets]] or [[Corporate opportunity|opportunities]]. Political scientists Ken Kernaghan and John Langford define self-dealing as "a situation where one takes an action in an official capacity which involves dealing with oneself in a private capacity and which confers a benefit on oneself."&lt;ref name=kernaghan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kernaghan |first1=Ken |last2=Langford |first2=John |date=July 1990 |title=The Responsible Public Servant |pages=142 |isbn=978-0886450991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include "work[ing] for government and us[ing] your official position to secure a contract for a private consulting company you own" or "using your government position to get a summer job for your daughter."&lt;ref name=mcdonald&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethics.ubc.ca/people/mcdonald/conflict.htm |title=Ethics and Conflicts of Interest |last1=McDonald |first1=Michael |date=2003-06-19 |website=ubc.ca |publisher=[[University of British Columbia]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030809133328/http://www.ethics.ubc.ca/people/mcdonald/conflict.htm |archivedate=2003-08-09 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a fiduciary has engaged in self-dealing, this constitutes a breach of the fiduciary relationship. The principal of that fiduciary (the person to whom duties are owed) may sue and both recover the principal's lost profits and [[Disgorgement (law)|disgorge]] the fiduciary's wrongful profits.

Repeated self-dealing by a private foundation can result in the involuntary termination of its tax-exempt status.&lt;ref&gt;Fremont-Smith, Marion (2009).

[[File:Ted Stevens.jpg|thumb|right|[[List of United States Senators from Alaska|Alaskan Senator]] [[Ted Stevens]] referred to the [[Internet]] as "a series of tubes".]]
"A '''series of tubes'''" is a phrase coined originally as an analogy by then-[[United States Senator]] [[Ted Stevens]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Alaska]]) to describe the [[Internet]] in the context of opposing [[network neutrality]].&lt;ref name=curtis/&gt; On June 28, 2006, he used this metaphor to criticize a proposed amendment to a committee bill.  The amendment would have prohibited [[Internet service provider]]s such as [[AT&amp;T]], [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner Cable]] and [[Verizon Communications]] from charging fees to give some companies' data a higher priority in relation to other traffic. The metaphor has been widely ridiculed, particularly because Stevens displayed an extremely limited understanding of the Internet, even though he was in charge of the Senate committee with the responsibility for regulating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stevens.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=AboutSenatorStevens.CommitteeAssignments |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103101319/http://stevens.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=AboutSenatorStevens.CommitteeAssignments |archivedate=January 3, 2009 |title=United States Senator Ted Stevens : About Senator Stevens |publisher=U.S. Senate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/6201814/Google-easter-eggs-15-best-hidden-jokes.html|title=Google easter eggs: 15 best hidden jokes|last=Moore|first=Matthew|date=September 17, 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=30 May 2010|quote=His clumsy words, in a speech to a Senate committee opposing network neutrality, were seen to illustrate the poor understanding of some politicians about how the internet worked.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Felten]], [[Princeton University]] professor of [[computer science]], pointed out the unfairness of some criticisms of Stevens' wording, while maintaining that the underlying arguments were rather weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/taking-stevens-seriously |title=Taking Stevens Seriously |publisher=Freedom to Tinker |first=Ed |last=Felten |date=July 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media commentary ==
On June 28, 2006, [[Public Knowledge]] government affairs manager Alex Curtis wrote a brief blog entry introducing the senator's speech and posted an [[MP3]] recording.&lt;ref name=curtis&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/senator-stevens-speaks-net-neutrality |title=Senator Stevens Speaks on Net Neutrality |first=Alex |last=Curtis |publisher=Public Knowledge |date=June 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine blog ''27B Stroke 6'' featured a lengthier post by [[Ryan Singel]], which included Singel's transcriptions of some parts of Stevens' speech considered the most humorous.&lt;ref name="singel"/&gt; Within days, thousands of other blogs and message boards posted the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/07/02/sen-stevens-hilariou.html |title=Sen.

Stevens explains the Internet: "And again, the Internet is not something you just dump something on. It's not a truck. It's a series of tubes" |publisher=FARK.com |date=July 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/7/2/232335/3120 |title=Ted Stevens on the internets |publisher=Daily Kos |date=July 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="singel"/&gt;

Most writers and commentators derisively cited several of Stevens' misunderstandings of Internet technology, arguing that the speech showed that he had formed a strong opinion on a topic which he understood poorly (e.g., referring to an e-mail message as "an Internet" and blaming bandwidth issues for an e-mail problem much more likely to be caused by [[mail server]] or [[routing]] issues). The story sparked mainstream media attention, including a mention in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/08/business/08online.html |title=Tail is wagging the internet dog |publisher=The New York Times |first=Dan |last=Mitchell |date=July 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology podcast ''[[This Week in Tech]]'' discussed the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech/episodes/60|title=This Week in Tech 60 A Series of Tubes {{!}} TWiT.TV|website=TWiT.tv|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', as summarized by MediaPost commentator Ross Fadner, "'The Internet is a Series of Tubes!' spawned a new slogan that became a rallying cry for Net neutrality advocates. ... Stevens' overly simplistic description of the Web's infrastructure made it easy for pro-neutrality activists to label the other side as old and out-of-touch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/46525/immortalizing-ted-stevens-net-neutrality-for-post.html |title=Immortalizing Ted Stevens, Net Neutrality for Posterity | publisher=MediaPost |first=Ross |last=Fadner |date=August 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several parodies of Senator Stevens' speech have been created, usually consisting of samples taken from this speech with an added melody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=superfunky59|title=Series of Tubes Music Video|date=2006-12-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cZC67wXUTs&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' has made multiple references to "Techno" Ted Stevens's "series of tubes" description;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/sokn5t/party-pooper |title=Party Pooper |work=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart |date=July 12, 2006 |publisher=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/uo1ore/headlines---internet |title=Headlines - Internet |work=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart |date=July 12, 2006 |publisher=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/4arc5x/net-neutrality-act |title=Net Neutrality Act |work=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart |date=July 19, 2006 |publisher=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/57mjqg/phone-call-with-ted-stevens |title=Phone Call with Ted Stevens |work=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart |date=April 16, 2007 |publisher=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result, Stevens has become well known as the person who once headed the committee charged with regulating the Internet. "I have a letter from a big scientist who said I was absolutely right in using the word 'tubes'," Stevens said to reporters in response to ''The Daily Show''{{'}}s coverage. When asked if he'd think about going on the show to debate [[Jon Stewart]], Stevens replied, "I'd consider it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thelevithorntonexperience.newsvine.com/_news/2006/07/27/303169-senator-ted-stevens-will-defend-his-tubes-remarks-on-the-daily-show |title=Senator Ted Stevens will defend his "tubes" remarks on The Daily Show |publisher=Yahoo!

[[Google]] has included references to this in two of its products. [[Gears (software)|Gears]]' [[about box]] says "the gears that power the tubes" and [[Google Chrome]] had an [[about:]] [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] at the address &lt;tt&gt;about:[[internets]]&lt;/tt&gt; which displayed a screensaver of tubes (if [[Windows XP]]'s &lt;tt&gt;SSPIPES.SCR&lt;/tt&gt; is installed) with the page title "Don't Clog the Tubes!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lifehacker.com/5045164/google-chromes-full-list-of-special-about-pages |title=Google Chrome’s Full List of Special about: Pages |publisher=Lifehacker |date=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://robert.accettura.com/blog/2008/09/03/aboutinternets/ |title=about:internets |publisher=Robert Accettura's Fun With Wordage  |date=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When "about:internets" was entered on a computer lacking that screensaver, the tab displayed a gray screen with the page title "The Tubes are Clogged!"

On June 3, 2017, the British YouTuber Pyrocynical uploaded a pilot of a new series on his channel, which he named A Series of Tubes. Commonly abbreviated as ASOT, his series centered around giving commentary on recent events, especially those related to YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pyrocynical|title=DURV BANNED FROM YOUTUBE (ASOT)|date=2017-06-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEXYM9Iwg9s&amp;t=329s|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tribute ==
[[Alexandra Petri]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' wrote a humorous article entitled "Sen. Stevens, the tubes salute you" after Stevens died in an airplane crash August 9, 2010:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And as people remember him, make ill-timed jests, and muse on his legacy—all in real time, in great profusion—I worry that they are disrupting the ability of people elsewhere to receive their Internets. But for us in the Facebook generation who weren't around for the first plane crash and know the Bridge to Nowhere primarily as an SNL punchline, the senator's legacy is in that series of tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2010/08/senator_stevens_the_tubes_salu.html?waporef=obnetwork |title=Sen. Stevens, the tubes salute you |work=PostPartisan |publisher=The Washington Post |first=Alexandra |last=Petri |date=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The "Bridge to Nowhere" refers to the [[Gravina Island Bridge]], another issue Stevens was responsible for, for which he was also mocked.

In the [[United States]], '''strict constructionism''' refers to a particular [[Philosophy of law|legal philosophy]] of [[judicial interpretation]] that limits or restricts judicial interpretation.

== Strict sense of the term ==
Strict construction requires a judge to apply the text only as it is written. Once the court has a clear meaning of the text, no further investigation is required. Judges—in this view—should avoid drawing inferences from a statute or constitution and focus only on the text itself.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.socialstudieshelp.com/APGOV_Judiciary.htm The Judiciary: The Power of the Federal Judiciary]", The Social Studies Help Center&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Hugo Black]] (1886–1971) argued that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s injunction, that ''Congress shall make no law'' (against certain civil rights), should be construed strictly: ''no law'', thought Black, admits ''no exceptions''. However, "strict construction" is not a synonym for [[textualism]] or [[originalism]]. [[Antonin Scalia]], a major proponent of textualism, said that "no one ought to be" a strict constructionist, although to be a strict constructionist was preferred to being a "nontextualist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Antonin Scalia |authorlink1=Antonin Scalia |title=Common-Law Courts in a Civil-Law System: The Role of United States Federal Courts in Interpreting the Constitution and Laws |website=The Tanner Lectures on Human Values |publisher=University of Utah |accessdate=16 September 2015 |url=http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/scalia97.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911103004/http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/scalia97.pdf |archivedate=11 September 2006 |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term often contrasts with the phrase "[[judicial activism]]", used to describe judges who seek to enact legislation through court rulings, although the two terms are not actually opposites.

== Common use ==
"Strict constructionism" is also used in American political discourse as an umbrella term for conservative legal philosophies such as [[originalism]] and textualism, which emphasize judicial restraint and fidelity to the original meaning of constitutions and laws. It is frequently used even more loosely to describe any conservative judge or legal analyst.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Rosen, "[http://polazzo.stuysu.org/can_bush_deliver_a_conservative.htm Can Bush Deliver a Conservative Supreme Court?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219192336/http://polazzo.stuysu.org/can_bush_deliver_a_conservative.htm |date=2005-12-19 }}", November 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is pervasive, but in some tension with the legal meaning of the term.  For example, on the campaign trail in 2000, when speaking on his choices for new Supreme Court Justices, [[George W. Bush]] promised to appoint "strict constructionists in the mold of Justices [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]], [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]], and [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]]", though Thomas considers himself an originalist, and Scalia outright rejected strict construction, calling it "a degraded form of textualism", his [[modus operandi]].&lt;ref&gt;Antonin Scalia, ''A Matter of Interpretation'' 23 (Amy Guttman ed. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The use of the term strict construction in American politics is not new.  The term was used regularly by members of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] and Democrats during the [[antebellum period]] when they argued that powers of the federal government listed in Article I should be strictly construed.  They embraced this approach in the hope that it would ensure that the bulk of governmental power would remain with the states and not be usurped by the federal government via novel interpretations of its powers.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}  Perhaps the best known example of this approach is Jefferson's opinion arguing against the constitutionality of a national bank.  Because the vagueness of Article I inevitably lent itself to broad interpretations as well as narrow ones, strict constructionists turned to the somewhat restrained descriptions of the powers of Congress that were offered by advocates of the Constitution during ratification.  Thus, politicians who identified themselves as strict constructionists embraced an approach to constitutional interpretation that resembles what we today call originalism.&lt;ref&gt;"The Age of Strict Construction: A History of the Growth of Federal Power, 1789-1861."  Peter Zavodnyik, The Catholic University of America Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A broadly accepted, but possibly apocryphal, story has [[Davy Crockett]] delivering a speech called "Not Yours To Give", in which he urged the [[United States Congress]] to reject an appropriation for a Naval widow on the grounds that Congress had no [[Constitutional]] authority to give charity.  He was said to have been inspired to this view by [[Horatio Bunce]], a constituent in his district and by accounts given, a strict constructionist.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://fee.org/library/not-yours-to-give-2/ Not yours to give]", [[Foundation for Economic Education]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term began to be used by conservative and moderate Republican presidents beginning with [[Richard Nixon]] in 1968 when he was running for election.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} His pledge was to appoint justices that interpret the law and reinstate "law and order" to the judiciary. He appointed four justices that seemed to be of that philosophy. One of them, however, shifted leftward, while another became a moderate. The other two were in the mold of what most think of in terms of strict constructionists. [[Gerald Ford]], when running to serve a full term of his own distanced himself from this issue. [[Ronald Reagan]], however, also promised "Strict Constructionists". All three of his US Supreme Court nominees loosely fell into this category. Still one was more of an originalist while the other two were fairly conservative. Every major Republican nominee since Reagan has promised to nominate only strict constructionists for the US Supreme Court and mostly such judges for other federal courts.

==Criticisms==
The term has been criticized&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lsolum.typepad.com/legaltheory/2011/02/legal-theory-lexicon-strict-construction-judicial-activism.html Legal Theory Lexicon: Strict Construction &amp; Judicial Activism]"&lt;/ref&gt; as being a misleading or meaningless term.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Russell (legal analyst)|Karen Russell]], "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-russell/why-the-strict-constru_b_4517.html Why The 'Strict Constructionist' Crowd Makes Me Really Nervous]", ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', July 21, 2005.; See also Trevor Morrison, "[http://court.thinkprogress.org/2005/07/24/roberts-the-strict-constructionist/  Roberts the 'strict constructionist'?]", [[Think Progress]], July 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Few judges self-identify as strict constructionists, due to the narrow meaning of the term. [[Antonin Scalia]], the justice most identified with the term, once wrote: "I am not a strict constructionist, and no one ought to be", calling the philosophy "a degraded form of textualism that brings the whole philosophy into disrepute". Scalia summarized his textualist approach as follows: "A text should not be construed strictly, and it should not be construed leniently; it should be construed reasonably, to contain all that it fairly means."  He continued with one real case to differentiate them:

:The difference between textualism and strict constructionism can be seen in a statutory case my Court decided last term. The statute at issue provided for an increased jail term if, "during and in relation to ... [a] drug trafficking crime," the defendant "uses ... a firearm." The defendant in this case had sought to purchase a quantity of cocaine; and what he had offered to give in exchange for the cocaine was an unloaded firearm, which he showed to the drug-seller. The Court held, I regret to say, that the defendant was subject to the increased penalty, because he had "used a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime." The case was not even close (6–3). I dissented. Now I cannot say whether my colleagues in the majority voted the way they did because they are strict-construction textualists, or because they are not textualists at all. But a proper textualist, which is to say my kind of textualist, would surely have voted with me. The phrase "uses a gun" fairly connoted use of a gun for what guns are normally used for, that is, as a weapon.
 
:When you ask someone "Do you use a cane?" you are not inquiring whether he has hung his grandfather's antique cane as a decoration in the hallway.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060911103004/http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/scalia97.pdf A Matter of Interpretation]'', Scalia, Princeton Univ. Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Doctrine of absurdity&lt;!--'Doctrine of Absurdity' and 'Doctrine of absurdity' redirect here--&gt; ===
Constitutional scholar [[John Hart Ely]] believed that "strict constructionism" is not really a philosophy of law or a theory of interpretation, but a coded label for judicial decisions popular with a particular political party.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, Democracy and Distrust (Harvard UP 1980) at p. 1;&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, strictly literal interpretations of statutes can lead one to logically deduce [[Absurdity|absurdities]], and the '''doctrine of absurdity'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is that commonsense interpretations should be used in such cases, rather than literal reading of a law or of original intent. The absurdity doctrine is a doctrine in legal theory, also known as "[[Clerical error|scrivener's error]] exception"; in which American courts have interpreted statutes contrary to their plain meaning in order to avoid absurd legal conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Absurdity Doctrine, Harvard Law Review, John F. Manning, Vol.116, #8, June, 2003, pp. 2387-2486, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1342768]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Statutory Construction and the "Absurdity Doctrine" or "Scrivener's Error" Exception'', Francis G.X. Pileggi, [http://www.delawarelitigation.com/2007/04/articles/chancery-court-updates/statutory-construction-and-the-absurdity-doctrine-or-scriveners-error-exception/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glen Staszewski, "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=896310 Avoiding Absurdity]", Indiana Law Journal, Vol. 81, p. 1001, 2006,&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, Veronica M., "[http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/aulr44&amp;div=12&amp;id=&amp;page= Absurdity and the Limits of Literalism: Defining the Absurd Result Principle in Statutory Interpretation]", 44 Am.

{{quote|The common sense of man approves the judgment mentioned by [[Pufendorf|Puffendorf]] [''sic''], that the Bolognian law which enacted "that whoever drew blood in the streets should be punished with the utmost severity", did not extend to the surgeon who opened the vein of a person that fell down in the street in a fit. The same common sense accepts the ruling, cited by Plowden, that the statute of 1st Edward II, which enacts that a prisoner who breaks prison shall be guilty of a felony, does not extend to a prisoner who breaks out when the prison is on fire – "for he is not to be hanged because he would not stay to be burnt".&lt;ref&gt;K Mart Copr.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1488">The '''Victorian Commission for Gambling Regulation''' (VCGR) was the [[gambling]] regulator in the [[Australian]] state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] from 2004 until February 2012. The VCGR was part of the Victorian Department of Justice.

The VCGR regulated the four gambling operators who held a gambling licence in Victoria:

* [[Tabcorp Holdings Limited]]
* [[Tatts Group Limited]]
* [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]]
* [[Intralot]]

On 6 February, 2012, the VCGR merged with Responsible Alcohol Victoria and formed the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation (VCGLR).  
The VCGLR takes on and integrates the roles and functions of the Victorian Commission for Gambling Regulation, the Director of Liquor Licensing and the Liquor Licensing Panel. The Commission has the power to undertake disciplinary actions and assumes the administrative and educative functions of Responsible Alcohol Victoria.
