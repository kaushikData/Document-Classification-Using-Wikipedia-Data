The '''Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs''' ('''ACBSP'''), formerly the '''Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs''', is a U.S. organization offering [[educational accreditation|accreditation]] services to business programs focused on teaching and learning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acbsp.org/?page=about_us ACBSP Mission], http://www.acbsp.org/?page=about_us&lt;/ref&gt;

Based in [[Overland Park]], [[Kansas]] (a suburb of [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City]]), ACBSP was created to fulfill a need for specialized accreditation by colleges and universities with business schools and programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP)|url=http://www.collegeatlas.org/acbsp.html|journal=CollegeAtlas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
ACBSP was founded in 1989 to accredit [[business school]]s with an emphasis on teaching and learning.&lt;ref name=ACBSP/&gt; At the time, only 260 out of 2,400 schools of business had specialized professional accreditation, all from the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB). Most or all of the AACSB accredited schools had an emphasis on research, while most other schools had an emphasis on teaching.  On April 28, 1988, 150 of the non-accredited schools met in Kansas City, Missouri, to consider alternatives to AACSB accreditation for teaching-oriented schools.&lt;ref name=About&gt;[http://www.acbsp.org/p/cm/ld/fid=11 About ACBSP]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811080827/http://www.acbsp.org/p/cm/ld/fid%3D11 |date=August 11, 2010 }}, ACBSP website, accessed October 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 12, 1989, a study group completed a feasibility study and submitted recommendations for standard for accreditation by the ACBSP.  In August 1992, ACBSP was recognized by the [[U.S. Department of Education]] as a specialized accreditation agency for business education.  In June 1994, a U.S. Department of Education Advisory Committee recommended withdrawal of recognition for the ACBSP due to a determination that ACBSP accreditation would not be a "required element" in making an institution eligible to participate in [[U.S. federal government]] programs under the [[Higher Education Act of 1965|Higher Education Act]] or other authorities.&lt;ref name=meeting1995&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/other/1995-4/fr13oc5a.html  National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, Notice of public meeting] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926074308/http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/other/1995-4/fr13oc5a.html |date=September 26, 2011 }}, ''Federal Register'', October 13, 1995 (Volume 60, Number 198), Page 53345-53347&lt;/ref&gt; However, at its meeting on January 22, 2001, the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA) Board of Directors granted recognition to the ACBSP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/Directories/special.asp CHEA Directory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923101401/http://www.chea.org/Directories/special.asp |date=2014-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 19, 2011 The CHEA renewed its recognition of the ACBSP for a further 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chea.org/pdf/Recognition/2011_09_20_Recognition%20Summary%20for%20ACBSP.pdf |title=CHEA Recognition Summary |access-date=2011-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090157/http://www.chea.org/pdf/Recognition/2011_09_20_Recognition%20Summary%20for%20ACBSP.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the ACBSP changed its name from Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs to Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acbsp.org/p/cm/ld/fid=11 About ACBSP]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811080827/http://www.acbsp.org/p/cm/ld/fid%3D11 |date=August 11, 2010 }}, ACBSP website, accessed October 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acbsp.org/?page=chea_recognition ], ACBSP CHEA&lt;/ref&gt; The ACBSP accredits mostly business schools with traditional campus locations, but also accredits online business programs as well.

== Membership ==
As of August 2010, ACBSP reported having over 8,000 individual members and 828 member educational institutions, of which 529 had ACBSP accreditation and 220 had candidacy status. All but 134 member institutions are in the United States.&lt;ref name=About/&gt; In April 2013, ACBSP reported 1,171 member campuses, 183 of which are located outside of the U.S. Of those campuses, 586 have achieved accreditation and more than 500 are in candidacy for accreditation. Individual members on these campuses now exceed 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acbsp.org/?page=history ACBSP Website - History] Retrieved January 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employer recognition ==
In 2006, [[Intel]] announced that it would no longer provide tuition reimbursement for employees to attend business schools with accreditation from ACBSP, accepting only [[AACSB]] accredited courses. At the same time the company imposed a similar restriction on reimbursements for engineering programs. The company explained that the policy change was intended to make the program more cost-effective to the company, noting that employees had been receiving reimbursement for programs "that were not of the highest value to the company" or left Intel after finishing programs that did not advance their careers there.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbertson, Dawn (December 5, 2006).

'''Animal coloration'''&lt;!--British English--&gt; is the general appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of [[light]] from its surfaces. Some animals are brightly coloured, while others are hard to see. In some species, such as the [[peafowl]], the male has strong patterns, conspicuous colours and is [[iridescent]], while the female is far less visible.

There are several separate reasons why animals have evolved colours. [[Camouflage]] enables an animal to remain hidden from view. Animals use colour to [[advertising in biology|advertise]] services such as [[cleaning symbiosis|cleaning]] to animals of other species; to [[signalling theory|signal]] their [[Sexual selection|sexual status]] to other members of the same species; and in [[mimicry]], taking advantage of the [[aposematism|warning coloration]] of another species. Some animals use flashes of colour to divert attacks by [[deimatic behaviour|startling]] predators. Zebras may possibly use motion dazzle, confusing a predator's attack by moving a bold pattern rapidly. Some animals are coloured for physical protection, with pigments in the skin to protect against sunburn, while some frogs can lighten or darken their skin for [[temperature regulation]]. Finally, animals can be coloured incidentally. For example, blood is red because the [[haem]] pigment needed to carry oxygen is red. Animals  coloured in these ways can have striking [[natural patterns]].

Animals produce colour in different ways. [[Pigment]]s are particles of coloured material. [[Chromatophore]]s are cells containing pigment. The distribution of the pigment particles in the chromatophores can change under [[Hormone|hormonal]] or [[neurotransmitter|neuronal]] control. For fishes it has been demonstrated that chromatophores may respond directly to environmental stimuli like visible light, UV-radiation, temperature, pH, chemicals, etc.,&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 2001"&gt;{{cite book | last=Meyer-Rochow|first= VB|title=[[Fish chromatophores as sensors of environmental stimuli]] - Book=Sensory Biology of Jawed Fishes; editors Kapoor BG &amp; Hara TJ; Science Publishers Enfield (NH), USA|date=2001|pages=317–334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colour change helps individuals in becoming more or less visible and is important in agonistic displays and in camouflage. Some animals, including many butterflies and birds, have [[structural coloration|microscopic structures]] in scales, bristles or feathers which give them brilliant iridescent colours. Other animals including squid and some deep-sea fish can [[bioluminescence|produce light]], sometimes of different colours. Animals often use two or more of these mechanisms together to produce the colours and effects they need.

==History==
[[File:Micrographia title page.gif|thumb|upright|[[Robert Hooke]]'s ''Micrographia'']]
{{further|Coloration evidence for natural selection}}

Animal coloration has been a topic of interest and [[research]] in [[biology]] for centuries. In the [[classical era]], [[Aristotle]] recorded that the [[octopus]] was able to change its coloration to match its background, and when it was alarmed.&lt;ref name=Aristotle&gt;Aristotle (c. 350 BC). ''Historia Animalium''. IX, 622a: 2–10. Cited in Borrelli, Luciana; Gherardi, Francesca; Fiorito, Graziano (2006). ''A catalogue of body patterning in Cephalopoda''. Firenze University Press. {{ISBN|978-88-8453-377-7}}. [http://www.fupress.com/scheda.asp?IDV=487 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1665 book ''[[Micrographia]]'', [[Robert Hooke]] describes the "fantastical" ([[Structural coloration|structural]], not pigment) colours of the Peacock's feathers:&lt;ref name=Hooke&gt;[[Robert Hooke|Hooke, Robert]] (1665) ''[[Micrographia]]''. Ch. 36 ('Observ. XXXVI. ''Of Peacoks, Ducks, and Other Feathers of Changeable Colours''.'). J. Martyn and J. Allestry, London. [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hooke/robert/micrographia/index.html Full text].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The parts of the Feathers of this glorious Bird appear, through the Microscope, no less gaudy then do the whole Feathers; for, as to the naked eye 'tis evident that the stem or quill of each Feather in the tail sends out multitudes of Lateral branches, ... so each of those threads in the Microscope appears a large long body, consisting of a multitude of bright reflecting parts. &lt;br&gt;... their upper sides seem to me to consist of a multitude of thin plated bodies, which are exceeding thin, and lie very close together, and thereby, like [[Nacre|mother of Pearl]] shells, do not onely reflect a very brisk light, but tinge that light in a most curious manner; and by means of various positions, in respect of the light, they reflect back now one colour, and then another, and those most vividly.  Now, that these colours are onely fantastical ones, that is, such as arise immediately from the refractions of the light, I found by this, that water wetting these colour'd parts, destroy'd their colours, which seem'd to proceed from the alteration of the reflection and refraction.|Robert Hooke&lt;ref name=Hooke/&gt;}}

According to [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 theory of [[natural selection]], features such as coloration [[evolution|evolved]] by providing individual animals with a reproductive advantage. For example, individuals with slightly better camouflage than others of the same [[species]] would, on average, leave more offspring. In his ''[[Origin of Species]]'', Darwin wrote:&lt;ref name=Darwin&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', Ch. 4. John Murray, London.

However, the Thayers spoilt their case by arguing that camouflage was the sole purpose of animal coloration, which led them to claim that even the brilliant pink plumage of the [[flamingo]] or the [[roseate spoonbill]] was cryptic—against the momentarily pink sky at dawn or dusk. As a result, the book was mocked by critics including [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as having "pushed [the "doctrine" of concealing coloration] to such a fantastic extreme and to include such wild absurdities as to call for the application of common sense thereto."&lt;ref&gt;[[Abbott Handerson Thayer|Thayer, Abbott Handerson]] and Thayer, Gerald H.

==Evolutionary reasons for animal coloration==

===Camouflage===
{{Main|Camouflage|List of camouflage methods}}

One of the pioneers of research into animal coloration, [[Poulton, E. B.|Edward Bagnall Poulton]]&lt;ref name=poulton&gt;[[Edward Bagnall Poulton|Poulton, Edward Bagnall]] (1890). ''[[The Colours of Animals|The Colours of Animals, their meaning and use, especially considered in the case of insects]]''. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner. London. pp. 331–334&lt;/ref&gt; classified the forms of protective coloration, in a way which is still helpful. He described: protective resemblance; aggressive resemblance; adventitious protection; and variable protective resemblance.&lt;ref name=forbes50&gt;Forbes, 2009. pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; These are covered in turn below.
[[File:Orange oak leaf bottom.JPG|thumb|left|A camouflaged orange oak leaf butterfly, ''[[Kallima inachus]]'' (centre) displays protective resemblance]]

Protective resemblance is used by prey to avoid predation. It includes special protective resemblance, now called [[Mimesis (biology)|mimesis]], where the whole animal looks like some other object, for example when a caterpillar resembles a twig or a bird dropping. In general protective resemblance, now called [[crypsis]], the animal's texture blends with the background, for example when a moth's colour and pattern blend in with tree bark.&lt;ref name=forbes50/&gt;

[[File:Insect camouflage PP08338.png|thumb|right|A flower mantis, ''[[Hymenopus coronatus]]'', displays special [[Aggressive mimicry|aggressive resemblance]]]]
[[Aggressive mimicry|Aggressive resemblance]] is used by [[predation|predator]]s or [[parasite]]s. In special aggressive resemblance, the animal looks like something else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example when a [[flower mantis]] resembles a particular kind of flower, such as an [[orchid]]. In general aggressive resemblance, the predator or parasite blends in with the background, for example when a [[leopard]] is hard to see in long grass.&lt;ref name=forbes50/&gt;

For adventitious protection, an animal uses materials such as twigs, sand, or pieces of shell to conceal its outline, for example when a [[caddis fly]] larva builds a decorated case, or when a [[decorator crab]] decorates its back with seaweed, sponges and stones.&lt;ref name=forbes50/&gt;

In variable protective resemblance, an animal such as a [[chameleon]], flatfish, squid or [[octopus]] changes its skin pattern and colour using special [[chromatophore]] cells to resemble whatever background it is currently resting on (as well as for [[Signalling theory|signalling]]).&lt;ref name=forbes50/&gt;

The main mechanisms to create the resemblances described by Poulton – whether in nature or in military applications – are [[crypsis]], blending into the background so as to become hard to see (this covers both special and general resemblance); [[Camouflage#Disruptive patterning|disruptive patterning]], using colour and pattern to break up the animal's outline, which relates mainly to general resemblance; mimesis, resembling other objects of no special interest to the observer, which relates to special resemblance; [[countershading]], using graded colour to create the illusion of flatness, which relates mainly to general resemblance; and [[Bioluminescence#Counterillumination camouflage|counterillumination]], producing light to match the background, notably in some species of [[squid]].&lt;ref name=forbes50/&gt;

Countershading was first described by the American artist [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]], a pioneer in the theory of animal coloration. Thayer observed that whereas a painter takes a flat canvas and uses coloured paint to create the illusion of solidity by painting in shadows, animals such as deer are often darkest on their backs, becoming lighter towards the belly, creating (as zoologist [[Cott, H. B.|Hugh Cott]] observed) the illusion of flatness,&lt;ref name=cott&gt;Cott, H. B. 1940&lt;/ref&gt; and against a matching background, of invisibility. Thayer's observation "Animals are painted by Nature, darkest on those parts which tend to be most lighted by the sky's light, and ''vice versa''" is called ''Thayer's Law''.&lt;ref name=forbesthayer&gt;Forbes, 2009. pp. 72–3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signalling===
{{further|Signalling theory}}

Colour is widely used for signalling in animals as diverse as birds and shrimps. Signalling encompasses at least three purposes:

*  [[advertising in biology|advertising]], to signal a capability or service to other animals, whether within a species or not
* sexual selection, where members of one sex choose to mate with suitably coloured members of the other sex, thus driving the development of such colours
* warning, to signal that an animal is harmful, for example can sting, is poisonous or is bitter-tasting. Warning signals may be mimicked truthfully or untruthfully.

====Advertising services====
[[File:Cleaner station komodo.jpg|thumb|Cleaner [[wrasse]] signals its [[Cleaning symbiosis|cleaning services]] to a [[Priacanthidae|big eye squirrelfish]]]]
{{main|Advertising in biology}}

Advertising coloration can signal the services an animal offers to other animals. These may be of the same species, as in [[sexual selection]], or of different species, as in [[cleaning symbiosis]]. Signals, which often combine colour and movement, may be understood by many different species; for example, the cleaning stations of the banded coral shrimp ''[[Stenopus hispidus]]'' are visited by different species of fish, and even by reptiles such as [[hawksbill sea turtle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Brian Morton |author2=John Edward Morton |year=1983 |title=The Sea Shore Ecology of Hong Kong |publisher=[[Hong Kong University Press]] |isbn=978-962-209-027-9 |chapter=The coral sub-littoral |pages=253–300 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r79kKRbkzMwC&amp;pg=PA273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Voss, Gilbert L. |title=Seashore Life of Florida and the Caribbean |publisher=[[Courier Dover Publications]] |isbn=978-0-486-42068-4 |chapter=The crustaceans |pages=78–123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=scXKvA97b24C&amp;pg=PA84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1590/S1676-06032004000100011|title=Hawksbill turtles visit moustached barbers: Cleaning symbiosis between ''Eretmochelys imbricata'' and the shrimp ''Stenopus hispidus''|journal=Biota Neotropica|volume=4|pages=1–6|year=2004|last1=Sazima|first1=Ivan|last2=Grossman|first2=Alice|last3=Sazima|first3=Cristina|url=http://www.biotaneotropica.org.br/v4n1/pt/fullpaper?bn01504012004+en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sexual selection ====
[[File:Paradesia decora Keulemans.jpg|upright=0.8|left|thumb|Male [[Goldie's bird of paradise]] displays to a female]]
{{Main|Sexual selection}}

Darwin observed that the males of some species, such as birds of paradise, were very different from the females.

Darwin explained such male-female differences in his theory of sexual selection in his book ''[[The Descent of Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1874). ''[[The Descent of Man]]''. Heinemann, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the females begin to select males according to any particular characteristic, such as a long tail or a coloured crest, that characteristic is emphasized more and more in the males. Eventually all the males will have the characteristics that the females are sexually selecting for, as only those males can reproduce. This mechanism is powerful enough to create features that are strongly disadvantageous to the males in other ways. For example, some male [[birds of paradise]] have wing or tail streamers that are so long that they impede flight, while their brilliant colours may make the males more vulnerable to predators. In the extreme, sexual selection may drive species to extinction, as has been argued for the enormous horns of the male Irish elk, which may have made it difficult for mature males to move and feed.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G.F. (2000). ''The Mating Mind: How sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature''. Heinemann, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different forms of sexual selection are possible, including rivalry among males, and selection of females by males.

====Warning====
[[File:Micrurus tener.jpg|right|thumb|A [[venom]]ous [[coral snake]] uses bright colours to warn off potential predators.]]
{{Main|Aposematism}}

Warning coloration (aposematism) is effectively the "opposite" of camouflage, and a special case of advertising. Its function is to make the animal, for example a wasp or a coral snake, highly conspicuous to potential predators, so that it is noticed, remembered, and then avoided. As Peter Forbes observes, "Human warning signs employ the same colours – red, yellow, black, and white – that nature uses to advertise dangerous creatures."&lt;ref name=Forbes52&gt;Forbes, 2009. p. 52 and plate 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Warning colours work by being associated by potential predators with something that makes the warning coloured animal unpleasant or dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Cott, 1940. p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be achieved in several ways, by being any combination of:

[[File:Tyria jacobaeae caterpillar.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|The black and yellow warning colours of the cinnabar moth caterpillar, ''[[Tyria jacobaeae]]'', are [[instinct]]ively avoided by some birds.]]

* distasteful, for example caterpillars, pupae and adults of the [[cinnabar moth]], the [[Danaus plexippus|monarch]] and the [[Euphydryas chalcedona|variable checkerspot butterfly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2408519|jstor=2408519|title=Bird Predation as a Selective Agent in a Butterfly Population|journal=Evolution|volume=39|pages=93|year=1985|last1=Bowers|first1=M. Deane|last2=Brown|first2=Irene L.|last3=Wheye|first3=Darryl}}&lt;/ref&gt; have bitter-tasting chemicals in their blood. One monarch contains more than enough [[digitalis]]-like [[toxin]] to kill a cat, while a monarch extract makes [[European starling|starlings]] vomit.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 2008. p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
* foul-smelling, for example the [[skunk]] can eject a liquid with a long-lasting and powerful odour&lt;ref name=CottSkunk&gt;Cott, 1940, p. 241, citing [[Gilbert White]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* aggressive and able to defend itself, for example [[honey badger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black, White and Stinky: Explaining Coloration in Skunks and Other Boldly Colored Animals|url=https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/black-white-and-stinky-explaining-coloration-skunks-and-other-boldly-colored-animals|publisher=University of Massachusetts Amberst|accessdate=21 March 2016|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* venomous, for example a [[wasp]] can deliver a painful sting, while snakes like the [[viper (animal)|viper]] or [[coral snake]] can deliver a fatal bite.&lt;ref name=Forbes52/&gt;

Warning coloration can succeed either through inborn behaviour ([[instinct]]) on the part of potential predators,&lt;ref name=Lindstrom&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://users.jyu.fi/~lilema/papers_files/1999_BehEcol.pdf | title=Reactions of hand-reared and wild-caught predators toward warningly colored, gregarious, and conspicuous prey |author1=Lindström, Leena |author2=Alatalo, Rauno V |author3=Mappes, Johanna | journal=Behavioral Ecology | year=1999 | volume=10 | issue=3 | pages=317–322 | doi=10.1093/beheco/10.3.317}}&lt;/ref&gt; or through a learned avoidance. Either can lead to various forms of mimicry. Experiments show that avoidance is learned in [[birds]],&lt;ref&gt;Cott, 1940. pp. 277–278.&lt;/ref&gt; [[mammals]],&lt;ref&gt;Cott, 1940. pp. 275–276.&lt;/ref&gt; [[lizards]],&lt;ref&gt;Cott, 1940. p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[amphibians]],&lt;ref&gt;Cott, 1940. pp. 279–289.&lt;/ref&gt; but that some birds such as [[great tit]]s have inborn avoidance of certain colours and patterns such as black and yellow stripes.&lt;ref name=Lindstrom/&gt;

===Mimicry===
{{Main|Mimicry}}
[[File:FinnBirdMimic.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hierococcyx varius|Hawk-cuckoo]] resembles predatory [[Accipiter badius|shikra]], giving cuckoo time to lay egg in songbird's nest unnoticed]]

Mimicry means that one species of animal resembles another species closely enough to deceive predators. To evolve, the mimicked species must have warning coloration, because appearing to be bitter-tasting or dangerous gives [[natural selection]] something to work on. Once a species has a slight, chance, resemblance to a warning coloured species, natural selection can drive its colours and patterns towards more perfect mimicry. There are numerous possible mechanisms, of which by far the best known are:

* '''[[Batesian mimicry]]''', where an edible species resembles a distasteful or dangerous species. This is most common in insects such as [[butterflies]]. A familiar example is the resemblance of harmless [[hoverflies]] (which have no sting) to [[bees]].
* '''[[Müllerian mimicry]]''', where two or more distasteful or dangerous animal species  resemble each other. This is most common among insects such as [[wasps]] and bees ([[hymenoptera]]).

''Batesian mimicry'' was first described by pioneering naturalist [[Henry W. Bates]]. When an edible prey animal comes to resemble, even slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those individuals that even very slightly better resemble the distasteful species. This is because even a small degree of protection reduces predation and increases the chance that an individual mimic will survive and reproduce. For example, many species of hoverfly are coloured black and yellow like bees, and are in consequence avoided by birds (and people).&lt;ref name=bates/&gt;

''Müllerian mimicry'' was first described by pioneering naturalist [[Fritz Müller]]. When a distasteful animal comes to resemble a more common distasteful animal, natural selection favours individuals that even very slightly better resemble the target. For example, many species of stinging wasp and bee are similarly coloured black and yellow. Müller's explanation of the mechanism for this was one of the first uses of mathematics in biology. He argued that a predator, such as a young bird, must attack at least one insect, say a wasp, to learn that the black and yellow colours mean a stinging insect. If bees were differently coloured, the young bird would have to attack one of them also. But when bees and wasps resemble each other, the young bird need only attack one from the whole group to learn to avoid all of them. So, fewer bees are attacked if they mimic wasps; the same applies to wasps that mimic bees. The result is mutual resemblance for mutual protection.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, 2009. pp. 39–42&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distraction ===
[[File:Gottesanbeterin Abwehr.JPG|thumb|A [[praying mantis]] in [[deimatic behaviour|deimatic]] or threat pose displays conspicuous patches of colour to startle potential predators. This is not warning coloration as the insect is palatable.]]

==== Startle ====
{{main|Deimatic behaviour}}

Some animals such as many [[moth]]s, [[mantis]]es and [[grasshopper]]s, have a repertory of threatening or [[deimatic behaviour|startling behaviour]], such as suddenly displaying conspicuous [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] or patches of bright and contrasting colours, so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator. This gives the prey animal an opportunity to escape. The behaviour is deimatic (startling) rather than aposematic as these insects are palatable to predators, so the warning colours are a bluff, not an [[honest signal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1464793105006810 |author =Stevens, Martin |title=The role of eyespots as anti-predator mechanisms, principally demonstrated in the Lepidoptera |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=80 |issue=4 |year=2005 |pages=573–588 |pmid=16221330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/86053.html | title=Deimatic Behavior | publisher=Springer | year=2012 | accessdate=31 December 2012 | author=Edmunds, Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Motion dazzle ====

Some prey animals such as [[zebra]] are marked with high-contrast patterns which possibly help to confuse their predators, such as [[lion]]s, during a chase. The bold stripes of a herd of running Zebra have been claimed make it difficult for predators to estimate the prey's speed and direction accurately, or to identify individual animals, giving the prey an improved chance of escape.&lt;ref name="Stevens Motion Dazzle"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/81/abstract | title=BMC Biology: Motion dazzle | publisher=BMC Biology | pages=9:81 | doi=10.1186/1741-7007-9-81 | work=Motion dazzle and camouflage as distinct anti-predator defenses | date=25 November 2011 | accessdate=27 November 2011 |author1=Martin Stevens |author2=William TL Searle |author3=Jenny E Seymour |author4=Kate LA Marshall |author5=Graeme D Ruxton }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since dazzle patterns (such as the Zebra's stripes) make animals harder to catch when moving, but easier to detect when stationary, there is an evolutionary trade-off between dazzle and [[#Camouflage|camouflage]].&lt;ref name="Stevens Motion Dazzle" /&gt; Another theory is that the zebra's stripes could provide some protection from flies and biting insects.&lt;ref name="BBC  Zebra"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/16944753 |title=BBC nature |work=Zebra stripes evolved to keep biting flies at bay |last=Gill |first=Victoria |date=9 February 2012}} Retrieved 30 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Some frogs such as ''[[Bokermannohyla alvarengai]]'', which basks in sunlight, lighten their skin colour when hot (and darkens when cold), making their skin reflect more heat and so avoid overheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Tribute to R.

{{further|Biological pigment}}

Some animals are coloured purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the [[olm]] that live in caves may be largely colourless as colour has no function in that environment, but they show some red because of the [[haem]] pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also have a little orange coloured [[riboflavin]] in their skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Istenic L. |author2=Ziegler I. |year=1974 |title=Riboflavin as "pigment" in the skin of ''Proteus anguinus'' L. |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=61|issue=12 |pages=686–687|doi=10.1007/bf00606524 |bibcode=1974NW.....61..686I}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human [[albino]]s and people with fair skin have a similar colour for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/2791/2858109/toolbox/Table11_1.pdf | title=Color Variations in Light and Dark Skin | publisher=Prentice-Hall | year=2007 | accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms of colour production in animals ==

Animal coloration may be the result of any combination of [[biological pigment|pigments]], [[chromatophores]], [[Color#Structural color|structural coloration]] and [[bioluminescence]].&lt;ref name="Wallin"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bioscience-explained.org/ENvol1_2/pdf/paletteEN.pdf | title=Nature's Palette | publisher=Bioscience-explained.org | work=Nature's Palette: How animals, including humans, produce colours | year=2002 | accessdate=17 November 2011 | author=Wallin, Margareta | pages=Vol 1, No 2, pages 1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coloration by pigments ===
{{main|Biological pigment|Seasonal camouflage}}
[[File:Flamingo rubro-Phoenicopterus ruber ruber.jpg|thumb|left|The red [[Biological pigment|pigment]] in a flamingo's plumage comes from its diet of shrimps, which get it from microscopic algae.]]

Pigments are coloured chemicals (such as [[melanin]]) in animal tissues.&lt;ref name="Wallin"/&gt; For example, the [[Arctic fox]] has a white coat in winter (containing little pigment), and a brown coat in summer (containing more pigment), an example of [[seasonal camouflage]] (a [[polyphenism]]). Many animals, including [[mammals]], [[birds]], and [[amphibians]], are unable to synthesize most of the pigments that colour their fur or feathers, other than the brown or black melanins that give many mammals their earth tones.&lt;ref name="HiltonPond"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.hiltonpond.org/ArticleAnimalColorsMain.html | title=South Carolina Wildlife | publisher=Hilton Pond Center | work=Animal Colors | year=1996 | accessdate=26 November 2011 | author=Hilton Jr., B. | pages=10–15|volume=43|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the bright yellow of an [[American goldfinch]], the startling orange of a juvenile [[red-spotted newt]], the deep red of a [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinal]] and the pink of a [[flamingo]] are all produced by [[carotenoid]] pigments synthesized by plants. In the case of the flamingo, the bird eats pink shrimps, which are themselves unable to synthesize carotenoids. The shrimps derive their body colour from microscopic red algae, which like most plants are able to create their own pigments, including both carotenoids and (green) [[chlorophyll]]. Animals that eat green plants do not become green, however, as chlorophyll does not survive digestion.&lt;ref name="HiltonPond" /&gt;

=== Variable coloration by chromatophores ===
{{main|Chromatophores}}
{{further|Category:Animals that can change color}}
[[File:Melanophores with dispersed or aggregated melanosomes.svg|thumb|Fish and frog melanophores are cells that can change colour by dispersing or aggregating pigment-containing bodies.]]

Chromatophores are special pigment-containing [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that may change their size, but more often retain their original size but allow the pigment within them to become redistributed, thus varying the colour and pattern of the animal. Chromatophores may respond to hormonal and/or neurobal control mechanisms, but direst responses to stimulation by visible light, UV-radiation, temperature, pH-changes, chemicals, etc. have also been documented.&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 2001"/&gt;  The voluntary control of chromatophores is known as metachrosis.&lt;ref name="Wallin"/&gt; For example, [[cuttlefish]] and [[chameleon]]s can rapidly change their appearance, both for camouflage and for signalling, as [[Aristotle]] first noted over 2000&amp;nbsp;years ago:&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Historia Animalium''. IX, 622a: 2–10. About 400 BC. Cited in Luciana Borrelli, [[Francesca Gherardi]], Graziano Fiorito (2006). [http://www.fupress.com/scheda.asp?IDV=487 Abstract] [https://books.google.com/books?id=CW5RKQEL7-EC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3 ''A catalogue of body patterning in Cephalopoda'']. Firenze University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''The octopus ... seeks its prey by so changing its colour as to render it like the colour of the stones adjacent to it; it does so also when alarmed.''|Aristotle}}

[[File:Chromatophores.jpg|left|thumb|[[Squid]] chromatophores appear as black, brown, reddish and pink areas in this micrograph.]]
When [[cephalopod]] [[molluscs]] like [[squid]] and cuttlefish find themselves against a light background, they contract many of their chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark.&lt;ref&gt;Kozloff, Eugene N. (1983) ''Seashore Life of the Northern Pacific Coast: Illustrated Guide to Northern California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia''. University of Washington Press. 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amphibians]] such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains '[[xanthophores]]' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains '[[iridophores]]' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains '[[melanophores]]' with dark melanin.&lt;ref name="HiltonPond" /&gt;

=== Structural coloration ===
[[File:Peacock feathers closeup.jpg|thumb|left|The brilliant iridescent colours of the peacock's tail feathers are created by [[Structural coloration]].]]
[[File:Butterfly magnification series collage.jpg|thumb|upright|Butterfly wing at different magnifications reveals microstructured chitin acting as diffraction grating.]]
{{main|Structural coloration}}

While many animals are unable to synthesize carotenoid pigments to create red and yellow surfaces, the green and blue colours of bird feathers and insect carapaces are usually not produced by pigments at all, but by structural coloration.&lt;ref name="HiltonPond"/&gt; Structural coloration means the production of colour by microscopically-structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with [[visible light]], sometimes in combination with pigments: for example, [[peacock]] tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their structure makes them appear blue, turquoise and green. Structural coloration can produce the most brilliant colours, often [[iridescence|iridescent]].&lt;ref name="Wallin"/&gt; For example, the blue/green gloss on the plumage of [[birds]] such as [[ducks]], and the purple/blue/green/red colours of many [[beetles]] and [[butterflies]] are created by structural coloration.&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ScientificAmerican.com | title=Scientific American | work=Nature's Color Tricks | date=May 2012 | accessdate=23 April 2012 | author=Ball, P. | pages=60–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals use several methods to produce structural colour, as described in the table.&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;

=== Bioluminescence ===
[[File:Bioluminescence emitted by comb jelly of genus Euplokamis.jpg|thumb|A ''Euplokamis'' [[comb jelly]] is [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]].]]
{{main|Bioluminescence}}

Bioluminescence is the production of [[light]], such as by the [[photophore]]s of marine animals,&lt;ref name="Bioluminescence"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=DNrTfH5PcWoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Bioluminescence#v=onepage&amp;q=Bioluminescence&amp;f=false | title=Bioluminescence: chemical principles and methods | publisher=World Scientific | author=Shimomura, Osamu | origyear=2006 |year=2012| isbn=9789812568014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tails of [[glowworm|glow-worms]] and [[firefly|fireflies]]. Bioluminescence, like other forms of [[metabolism]], releases energy derived from the chemical energy of food. A pigment,  [[luciferin]] is catalysed by the [[enzyme]] [[luciferase]] to react with oxygen, releasing light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.npca.org/magazine/2005/spring/mysteries.html | title=Park Mysteries: Deep Blue | first = Scott | last = Kirkwood | newspaper = National Parks Magazine | date = Spring 2005 | issn = 0276-8186 | pages = 20–21 | publisher=[[National Parks Conservation Association]] | accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comb jelly|Comb jellies]] such as ''Euplokamis'' are bioluminescent, creating blue and green light, especially when stressed; when disturbed, they secrete an ink which luminesces in the same colours. Since comb jellies are not very sensitive to light, their bioluminescence is unlikely to be used to signal to other members of the same species (e.g. to attract mates or repel rivals); more likely, the light helps to distract predators or parasites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Haddock, S.H.D. |authorlink=Steven Haddock |author2=Case, J.F. |title=Bioluminescence spectra of shallow and deep-sea gelatinous zooplankton: ctenophores, medusae and siphonophores |journal=Marine Biology |date=April 1999 |volume=133 |issue=3 |pages=571–582 |doi=10.1007/s002270050497 |url=http://www.lifesci.ucsb.edu/~haddock/abstracts/haddock_spectra.pdf |accessdate=25 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516210612/http://www.lifesci.ucsb.edu/~haddock/abstracts/haddock_spectra.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species of [[squid]] have light-producing organs ([[photophores]]) scattered all over their undersides that create a sparkling glow.

[[Australian]] Aboriginal [[kinship]] are the systems of [[law]] governing social interaction, particularly [[marriage]], in traditional [[Australian Aboriginal culture]]s. It is an integral part of the culture of every [[List of Indigenous Australian group names|Aboriginal group]] across Australia.

==The subsection system==

Subsection systems are a unique social structure that divide all of Australian Aboriginal society into a number of groups, each of which combines particular sets of kin. In Central Australian Aboriginal English vernacular, subsections are widely known as "'''skins'''". Each subsection is given a name that can be used to refer to individual members of that group. Skin is passed down by a person's parents to their children.

The name of the groups can vary. There are systems with two such groupings (these are known as '[[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]' in kinship studies), systems with four (sections), six and eight (subsection systems). Some language groups extend this by having distinct male and female forms, giving a total of sixteen skin names, for example the Pintupi (listed below) and Warlpiri. While membership in skin groups is ideally based on blood relations, Australian Aboriginal subsection systems are classificatory, meaning that even people who are not actual blood relations are assigned to a subsection. They are also universal, meaning that every member of the society is assigned a position in the system.

Subsection systems are found in Aboriginal societies across much of Central, Western and Northern Australia. On the basis of detailed analysis and comparison of the various subsection systems and their terminologies, and in particular the apparent prefix /j-/ for male and /n-/ for female, it has been identified as a social innovation originally from the Daly River region of the Northern Territory, which then spread rapidly southwards to other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Systems with two groupings (moieties)===

====Yolngu====

The [[Yolngu|Yolŋu]] people of north-eastern [[Arnhem Land]] divide society (and much of the natural world) into two [[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]: ''Dhuwa'' and ''Yirritja''. Each of these is represented by people of a number of different groups (each with their own lands, languages and philosophies) through their [[hereditary]] [[Estate (law)|estates]] – so many things are either ''Yirritja'' or ''Dhuwa'':

:::{| class="wikitable"

|Rirratjingu, Galpu, Djambarrpuyngu, Golumala, Marrakulu,&lt;br/&gt;Marrangu, Djapu, Datiwuy, Ngaymil, Djarrwark.
|}

Fish, stone, river, sea etc., belongs to one or the other moiety. Things that are not either Dhuwa or Yirritja are called ''wakinŋu''. Yolŋu also have a kinship system with eight subsections (four Dhuwa and four Yirritja which is what creates moiety).

===Systems with four sections===

====Gamilaraay====

The [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] language group from [[New South Wales]] have a four section system.

====Martuthunira====

The [[Martuthunira language|Martuthunira]] language group from the [[Pilbara]] region of [[Western Australia]] have a four section system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Bilybara: Aboriginal languages of the Pilbara region |last=Sharp, Janet |author2=Nicholas Thieberger |year=1992 |publisher= Wangka Maya, The Pilbara Aboriginal Language Centre|location= Port Hedland, Western Australia |isbn= 0-646-10711-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The spelling '''''l.y''''' indicates that the letters represent two distinct [[phoneme]]s, and are not a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]).

Similar systems are found across most language groups in the Pilbara, though with some variation in the forms of the names. For example, speakers of [[Ngarla language|Ngarla]] use ''Milangka'' where Martuthunira use ''Pal.yarri''.

====Alyawarra====

The [[Alyawarre]] language group from [[Central Australia]] also have a four section system, but use different terms from the Martuthunira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Simple Introduction to Central Australian Kinship Systems |last=Wafer, Jim |year=1982 |publisher= Institute for Aboriginal Development, Alice Springs, Northern Territory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems with eight groups (subsection systems)===

====Lardil====
The [[Lardil]] of [[Mornington Island]] in the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] have eight subsection groups, shown here with some of their totems:

|Yakimarr
|Ngarrijbalangi

|Buranyi
|''Crane, salt water, &lt;br/&gt;sleeping turtle''

|-
|Burrarangi
|''Lightning, rough sea,&lt;br/&gt;black dingo''

|''Rock, pelican, [[brolga]],&lt;br/&gt;red dingo''
|Balyarriny
|Burrarangi

|Kangal
|''[[Barramundi]],&lt;br/&gt;grey shark''
|Buranyi
|Yakimarr
|-
|Ngarrijbalangi
|''Rainbird, shooting star,&lt;br/&gt;egret''
|Burrarangi
|Bangariny
|-
|Yakimarr
|''Seagull, barramundi,&lt;br/&gt;grey shark''
|Bangariny
|Kangal
|}

Each Lardil person belongs to one of these groups. Their paternal [[grandfather]]'s subsection determines their own; so a Balyarriny man or woman will have a Balyarriny grandfather. Members of each group may only marry members of one other, specified, group.

Once a person's subsection group is known, their relationship to any other Lardil can be determined. A Ngarrijbalangi is a 'father' to a Bangariny, a 'father-in-law' to a Yakimarr and a 'son' to another Bangariny, either in a social sense or purely through linearship.

The mechanics of the Lardil skin system means that generations of males cycle back and forth between two subsections. ''Ngarrijbalangi'' is father to ''Bangariny'' and ''Bangariny'' is father to ''Ngarrijbalangi'' and similarly for the three other pairs of subsections. Generations of women, however, cycle through four subsections before arriving back at the starting point. This means that a woman has the same subsection name as her ([[Matrilineality|matrilineal]]) great-great-grandmother.

====Pintupi====&lt;!-- This section header is linked to from the article "Makinti Napanangka" --&gt;
The [[Pintupi]] of the [[Western Desert (Australia)|Western Desert]] also have an eight subsection system, made more complex by distinct forms for male and female subsection names; male forms begin with "Tj", the female forms with "N". The [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] system is almost the same:

Each person therefore has a [[patriline|patrimoiety]] and a [[matriline|matrimoiety]], a father's and a mother's subsection group.

===Extension of the system to non-relatives===

Outsiders who have significant interaction with such groups may be given a 'skin name', commonly based on the people they have interacted with and the types of interaction.

==Some common kinship terms used in Aboriginal English==
{{Main article|Australian Aboriginal English}}

The variety of English used by many Australian Aboriginal people employs kinship terms in ways that are based on their equivalents in Australian Aboriginal languages.

*''Aunty'' and ''uncle''  are terms of address for older people, to whom the speaker may not be related. 
*''Brother'' and ''sister''—as well as siblings this term is used to refer to children of one's mother's sister and of father's brother (cousin), just as in many indigenous languages.
*''Cousin-brother'' and ''cousin-sister'' are often used to refer to children of one's mother's sister and father's brother.
*''Cousin'' refers to children of one's father's sister and mother's brother, but may be extended to any relative of one's own generation, such as one who might share the same great grandparent as their own great grandparent, which is a second-cousin in Aboriginal terms.
*In south-east Queensland, ''daughter'' is used to refer to any woman of one's great-grandparents' generation. This is due to the cyclical nature of traditional kinship systems and mirrors usage in many Australian languages.
*''Father'' and ''mother'' include any relative of one's parents' generation, such as uncles, aunts, their own cousins and in-laws.
*''Grandfather'' and ''grandmother'' can refer to anyone of one's grandparents' generation. ''Grandfather'' can also refer to any respected elderly man, to whom the speaker may not be related.
*''Poison'' refers to a relation one is obligated to avoid. See ''[[Mother-in-law language]]''.
*The term ''second'', or ''little bit'' in northern Australia, is used with a distant relative who is described using a close kinship term. For example, one's ''second father'' or ''little bit father'' is a man of one's father's generation not closely related to the speaker. Usually having a ''second mother'' is having a woman of your own mother's generation who seems to act like a mother and would most likely care for you if anything were to happen to your own parents. It is contrasted with ''close'', ''near'' or ''true''.
*A ''skin'' or ''skin group'' is a section determined by the skin of a person's parents, and determines who a person is eligible to marry.
*''Son'' can refer to any male of the next generation, such as nephews, just as ''daughter'' can refer to any female of the next generation, including nieces.

It was hosted and launched by Germany and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN)  in [[Bonn]] on 2 September 2011, in collaboration with the Global Partnership on Forest/Landscape Restoration and targets delivery on the [[Rio Convention]]s and other outcomes of the 1992 [[Earth Summit]].&lt;ref name="IUCN policy" /&gt;  As at 2013 over 20 million hectares of land had been pledged for restoration from countries including [[Brazil]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Rwanda]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On the Road to the Bonn Challenge|url=http://www.forestlandscaperestoration.org/resource/road-bonn-challenge|publisher=Global Partnership on Forest/Landscape Restoration|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]], Costa Rica, [[Pakistan]], [[China]], [[Rwanda]] and Brazil have embarked on successful landscape restoration programmes.&lt;ref name="3 News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Governments sign up to Bonn Challenge restoring degraded land|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Governments-sign-up-to-Bonn-Challenge-restoring-degraded-land/tabid/1160/articleID/258215/Default.aspx|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=3 News|date=19 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burra Katha''', also spelled Burrakatha, is an [[oral storytelling]] technique in the [[Katha (storytelling format)|Katha]] tradition, performed in villages of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]]. The troupe consists of one main performer and two co-performers. It is a narrative entertainment that consists of prayers, solo drama, dance, songs, poems and jokes. The topic will be either a [[Hindu]] mythological story ([[Jangam|Jangam Katha]]) or a contemporary social issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Burrakatha loses sheen sans patronage| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-14/visakhapatnam/36332535_1_artistes-burrakatha-art-form |date=Jan 14, 2013| accessdate = 2013-09-02
| publisher = [[The Times of India]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Burra - Katha was developed in Guntur district around 1942 with the aim of propagating political ideas among illiterate masses in villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4U5AAAAIAAJ|title=Vidya Bharathi|last=Lectures|first=Bangalore University Dept of Publications and Extension|date=1977-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The communists with the help of Andhra Praja Natya Mandali founded by Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy in Bezawada spread the message to the masses in the Naizam region during the rebellion against Nizam in the 1940s.

==Etymology==
"Burra" is referred to [[Tanpura|tambura]], a musical string instrument with a hollow shell. "Katha" means story.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Burrakatha.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Burrakatha photo from Vepachedu research foundation]] --&gt;
Burra means a skull in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. The shell resembles a [[human skull]]. It is made of baked clay or dried pumpkin, or of brass and copper. The instrument looks very similar to [[veena]] and the performer can pull and press strings to get music.

==Alternative names==
Burrakatha refers to the art throughout [[Andhra Pradesh]], and there are local names in each region.
* Coastal region: Tamboora or Jangam or Tandanana Katha
* Rayalaseema: Tamboora or Tandana katha or suddulu
* Telangana: Tamboora or Sarada katha

==History==
Burrakatha started as devotional songs of nomadic people and became a popular art form. It is played on radio and TV regularly in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is a 20th-century name for the theater show known as [[Jangam]] Katha. The [[jangam|jangams lingayats]] were wandering minstrels who worshiped and sang of [[Shiva|Lord Siva]]. Two performers participated in these plays: the storyteller and his wife. With societal and cultural changes, the secular aspect was incorporated into this form. The modern form has three performers of any gender.

Popular Hindu artists were Pendyala Venkateswarrao, Sunkara Sri Krishna Madhava Rao, Paruchuri Ramakotayya, Sirivisetti Subbarao, Kosuri Punnayya, Govardhana, Kakumanu Subbarao, Davuluru, Chintalal Suryanarayana, Budagajangala mote papaiah, Budagajangala mote kullayappa, Budagajangala mote ramalingam, etc. Women also formed groups, e.g., Moturi Udayam, Chintala Koteswaramma, Mahankali Lakshmi, Sridevi sisters, etc. Popular non-Hindu artists are Abraham Bhagavatar, Manohara Kavi, Khader Khan Sahib, Shaik Nazar etc.

==Modern form==
The main storyteller (kathakudu) narrates the story. He plays tambura and dances to music. He also wears a metal ring called an andelu on his right thumb, holds another ring in his other hand and adds more music by colliding them frequently.  The co-performers plays gummeta (also called dakki or budike), earthen drums with two heads. All three or only the kathakadu wear anklets (also called as gajjelu), which add even more music when they dance.

The right side performer (hasyaka, meaning joker) acts as a joker and cracks satires and jokes. The left side performer (rajakiya, meaning politician) acts as someone who knows worldly ways and talks about politics and social issues. The main performer and co-performers constantly was address each other. The co-performers interrupt the kathakudu with doubts, and they sometimes add emphasis to the main events in the story with short words similar to "Wow!" "Aha!" and "That is it."

Whenever the main performer sings a song, he or she starts with "vinara veera kumara veera gadha vinara" followed by the co-performers singing "tandhana tane tandhana na." It is also called 'tandana katha.'

==Significance==
Burra katha was a pastime event in villages. It is seen even now during [[Navratri|Dussehra]] or [[Sankranti]] festival seasons to describe events in epics like [[Ramayan]] and [[Mahabharat]] and also some of best and moral stories of kings like kambojaraju katha, chinnamma katha, muggurumoratila katha, etc.

It played an effective role in conveying message to people and awakening them during [[Indian Independence Movement]]. Burrakatha was banned in [[Madras]] by the British government and in [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] kingdom by Nizam government, because it was the medium to enlighten the people of the political situation in political meetings.

==Present==
Burrakatha tellers are called as budagajangalu. Internet and movies play a major role in modern life.
That's why the burrakathas are not being seen and no one is there to develop this and improve the art.
In past these burrakatha tellers were important in the villages; now there is no response for their art.

So these burrakatha tellers left their traditional art and have become beggars or day labourers. Even in these modern times, there are no educated people in this tribe. They don't have caste certificates for developing their tribe.

[[Daroji Eramma]] was a performer of Burra katha from [[Karnataka]].

'''Common descent''' describes how, in [[evolutionary biology]], a group of [[organism]]s share a [[most recent common ancestor]]. There is "massive"&lt;ref name="theobald"/&gt; [[evidence of common descent]] of all [[life]] on [[Earth]] from the [[last universal common ancestor]] (LUCA).&lt;ref name="theobald"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |date=13 May 2010 |title=A formal test of the theory of universal common ancestry |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |location=London |volume=465 |issue=7295 |pages=219–222 |doi=10.1038/nature09014 |pmid=20463738|bibcode=2010Natur.465..219T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="steel"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steel |first1=Mike |author1-link=Mike Steel (mathematician) |last2=Penny |first2=David |date=13 May 2010 |title=Origins of life: Common ancestry put to the test |journal=Nature |volume=465 |issue=7295 |pages=168–169 |doi=10.1038/465168a |pmid=20463725|bibcode=2010Natur.465..168S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 [[gene]]s from the LUCA, by comparing the [[genome]]s of the three [[domains of life]], [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160725"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |title=Meet Luca, the Ancestor of All Living Things |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/science/last-universal-ancestor.html |date=25 July 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=25 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common ancestry between organisms of different [[species]] arises during [[speciation]], in which new species are established from a single ancestral population.

Universal common descent through an [[evolution]]ary process was first proposed by the English [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Charles Darwin]] in the concluding sentence of his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'':

{{quote|There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.&lt;ref name="origin_490"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
{{See also|History of evolutionary thought}}

In the 1740s, the French [[mathematician]] [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] made the first known suggestion that all organisms had a common ancestor, and had diverged through random variation and [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Crombie |Hoskin |1970 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OOgzAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Maupertuis+%22for+the+first+time%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Maupertuis%20%22for%20the%20first%20time%22&amp;f=false 62–63]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Treasure |1985 |p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Essai de cosmologie'' (1750), Maupertuis noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;May we not say that, in the fortuitous combination of the productions of Nature, since only those creatures ''could'' survive in whose organizations a certain degree of adaptation was present, there is nothing extraordinary in the fact that such adaptation is actually found in all these species which now exist? Chance, one might say, turned out a vast number of individuals; a small proportion of these were organized in such a manner that the animals' organs could satisfy their needs. A much greater number showed neither adaptation nor order; these last have all perished.... Thus the species which we see today are but a small part of all those that a blind destiny has produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Harris |1981 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fkqg3TIkBJwC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=Essai+de+Cosmologie+%22blind+destiny%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Essai%20de%20Cosmologie%20%22blind%20destiny%22&amp;f=false 107]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1790, the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] wrote in ''Kritik der Urteilskraft'' (''[[Critique of Judgement]]'') that the similarity{{efn|Now called [[Homology (biology)|homology]].}} of animal forms implies a common original type, and thus a common parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Kant |1987 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y5wQD-ioaUUC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=Critique+of+Judgment+%22original+mother%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 304]}}: "Despite all the variety among these forms, they seem to have been produced according to a common archetype, and this analogy among them reinforces our suspicion that they are actually akin, produced by a common original mother."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1794, Charles Darwin's grandfather, [[Erasmus Darwin]], asked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]ould it be too bold to imagine, that in the great length of time, since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which {{Smallcaps |the great First Cause}} endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end?&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Darwin |1818 |p=397 [§&amp;nbsp;39.4.8]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]]'s views about common descent, as expressed in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', were that it was probable that there was only one progenitor for all life forms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Darwin |1859 |p=484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Common descent was widely accepted amongst the [[scientific community]] after Darwin's publication.&lt;ref&gt;Krogh, David. (2005). ''Biology: A Guide to the Natural World''. Pearson/Prentice Hall. p. 323. {{ISBN|978-0321946768}} "Descent with modification was accepted by most scientists not long after publication of Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection'' in 1859. Scientists accepted it because it explained so many facets of the living world."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, [[Vernon Lyman Kellogg|Vernon Kellogg]] commented that "practically no naturalists of position and recognized attainment doubt the theory of descent."&lt;ref&gt;[[Vernon Lyman Kellogg|Kellogg, Vernon L]]. (1907). [https://archive.org/stream/darwinismtodaydi00kell#page/3/mode/2up ''Darwinism To-Day'']. Henry Holt and Company. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, biologist [[T. Ryan Gregory]] noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No reliable observation has ever been found to contradict the general notion of common descent. It should come as no surprise, then, that the scientific community at large has accepted evolutionary descent as a historical reality since Darwin’s time and considers it among the most reliably established and fundamentally important facts in all of science.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, T. Ryan. (2008). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-007-0001-z ''Evolution as Fact, Theory, and Path'']. ''Evolution: Education and Outreach'' 1 (1): 46–52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{further|Evidence of common descent}}

===Common biochemistry===

All known forms of life are based on the same fundamental biochemical organization: genetic information encoded in [[DNA]], transcribed into [[RNA]], through the effect of [[protein]]- and RNA-[[enzyme]]s, then translated into proteins by (highly similar) [[ribosome]]s, with [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]] and others as energy sources. Analysis of small sequence differences in widely shared substances such as [[cytochrome c]] further supports universal common descent.&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Knight |first1=Robin |last2=Freeland |first2=Stephen J. |last3=Landweber |first3=Laura F. |date=January 2001 |title=Rewiring the keyboard: evolvability of the genetic code |journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=49–58 |doi=10.1038/35047500 |pmid=11253070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 23 proteins are found in all organisms, serving as [[enzyme]]s carrying out core functions like DNA replication.

The [[genetic code]] (the "translation table" according to which DNA information is translated into [[amino acid]]s, and hence proteins) is nearly identical for all known lifeforms, from [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] to [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s. The universality of this code is generally regarded by biologists as definitive evidence in favor of universal common descent.&lt;ref name=Knight/&gt;

The way that [[Genetic code|codon]]s (DNA triplets) are mapped to [[amino acid]]s seems to be strongly optimised. Richard Egel argues that in particular the [[hydrophobic]] (non-polar) side-chains are well organised, suggesting that these enabled the earliest organisms to create [[peptide]]s with water-repelling regions able to support the essential electron exchange ([[redox]]) reactions for energy transfer.&lt;ref name=Egel&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Egel |first1=Richard |title=Primal Eukaryogenesis: On the Communal Nature of Precellular States, Ancestral to Modern Life |journal=Life |date=March 2012 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=170–212 |doi=10.3390/life2010170 |pmc=4187143 |pmid=25382122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selectively neutral similarities===

Similarities which have no adaptive relevance cannot be explained by [[convergent evolution]], and therefore they provide compelling support for universal common descent. Such evidence has come from two areas: [[amino acid]] sequences and DNA sequences. Proteins with the same three-dimensional structure need not have identical amino acid sequences; any irrelevant similarity between the sequences is evidence for common descent. In certain cases, there are several [[Genetic code|codon]]s (DNA triplets) that code redundantly for the same amino acid. Since many species use the same codon at the same place to specify an amino acid that can be represented by more than one codon, that is evidence for their sharing a recent common ancestor. Had the amino acid sequences come from different ancestors, they would have been coded for by any of the redundant codons, and since the correct amino acids would already have been in place, [[natural selection]] would not have driven any change in the codons, however much time was available. [[Genetic drift]] could change the codons, but it would be extremely unlikely to make all the redundant codons in a whole sequence match exactly across multiple lineages. Similarly, shared nucleotide sequences, especially where these are apparently neutral such as the positioning of [[intron]]s and [[pseudogene]]s, provide strong evidence of common ancestry.&lt;ref name="Sharma2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharma |first=N. S. |title=Continuity And Evolution Of Animals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7Q47fvCfLIC&amp;pg=PA32 |year=2005 |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=978-81-8293-018-6 |pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other similarities===

Biologists often{{quantify|date=March 2018}} point to the universality of many aspects of cellular life as supportive evidence to the more compelling evidence listed above. These similarities include the energy carrier [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), and the fact that all amino acids found in proteins are [[Chirality (chemistry)#In biology|left-handed]]. It is, however, possible that these similarities resulted because of the [[Laws of science|laws of physics and chemistry]] - rather than through universal common descent - and therefore resulted in convergent evolution. In contrast, there is evidence for homology of the central subunits of [[ATPase#Transmembrane ATP synthases|Transmembrane ATPases]] throughout all living organisms, especially how the rotating elements are bound to the membrane. This supports the assumption of a LUCA as a cellular organism, although primordial membranes may have been semipermeable and evolved later to the membranes of modern bacteria, and on a second path to those of modern archaea also.&lt;ref&gt;

===Phylogenetic trees===
{{PhylomapB|size=300px|caption=A [[phylogenetic tree]] based on [[ribosomal RNA]] genes implies a single origin for all life.}}
{{Main |Phylogenetic tree}}
{{See also |Tree of life (biology)}}

Another important piece of evidence is from detailed phylogenetic trees (i.e., "genealogic trees" of species) mapping out the proposed divisions and common ancestors of all living species. In 2010, Douglas L. Theobald published a statistical analysis of available genetic data,&lt;ref name="theobald" /&gt; mapping them to phylogenetic trees, that gave "strong quantitative support, by a formal test, for the unity of life."&lt;ref name="steel" /&gt;

Traditionally, these trees have been built using morphological methods, such as appearance, [[embryology]], etc. Recently, it has been possible to construct these trees using molecular data, based on similarities and differences between genetic and protein sequences. All these methods produce essentially similar results, even though most [[genetic variation]] has no influence over external morphology. That phylogenetic trees based on different types of information agree with each other is strong evidence of a real underlying common descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html#independent_convergence |title=Prediction 1.3: Consilience of independent phylogenies |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |work=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: The Scientific Case for Common Descent |version=Version 2.89 |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive|The TalkOrigins Foundation]] |accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential objections==

[[File:Tree Of Life (with horizontal gene transfer).svg|thumb|2005 [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] shows many [[horizontal gene transfer]]s, implying multiple possible origins.]]

===Gene exchange clouds phylogenetic analysis===
{{further|Horizontal gene transfer}}

Theobald noted that substantial [[horizontal gene transfer]] could have occurred during early evolution. Bacteria today remain capable of gene exchange between distantly-related lineages. This weakens the basic assumption of phylogenetic analysis, that similarity of genomes implies common ancestry, because sufficient gene exchange would allow lineages to share much of their genome whether or not they [[monophyly|shared an ancestor (monophyly)]]. This has led to questions about the single ancestry of life.&lt;ref name="theobald" /&gt; However, biologists consider it very unlikely that completely unrelated proto-organisms could have exchanged genes, as their different coding mechanisms would have resulted only in garble rather than functioning systems. Later, however, many organisms all derived from a single ancestor could readily have shared genes that all worked in the same way, and it appears that they have.&lt;ref name="theobald" /&gt;

===Convergent evolution===
{{further|Convergent evolution}}

If early organisms had been driven by the same environmental conditions to [[Convergent evolution|evolve similar biochemistry convergently]], they might independently have acquired similar genetic sequences. Theobald's "formal test" was accordingly criticised by Takahiro Yonezawa and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yonezawa |first1=Takahiro |last2=Hasegawa |first2=Masami |title=Was the universal common ancestry proved? |date=16 December 2010 |journal=Nature |volume=468 |issue=7326 |page=E9 |doi=10.1038/nature09482 |pmid=21164432|bibcode=2010Natur.468E...9Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; for not including consideration of convergence. They argued that Theobald's test was insufficient to distinguish between the competing hypotheses. Theobald has defended his method against this claim, arguing that his tests distinguish between phylogenetic structure and mere sequence similarity. Therefore, Theobald argued, his results show that "real universally [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] proteins are [[sequence homology|homologous]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |date=16 December 2010 |title=Theobald reply |journal=Nature |volume=468 |issue=7326 |page=E10 |doi=10.1038/nature09483|bibcode=2010Natur.468E..10T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |date=24 November 2011 |title=On universal common ancestry, sequence similarity, and phylogenetic structure: The sins of P-values and the virtues of Bayesian evidence |journal=Biology Direct |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=60 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-6-60 |pmc=3314578 |pmid=22114984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''depolarizing prepulse (DPP)''' is an electrical stimulus that causes the [[Voltage|potential difference]] measured across a [[neuron]]al [[Cell membrane|membrane]] to become more positive or less negative, and precedes another electrical stimulus.&lt;ref name=Grill&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/51.395310 |vauthors=Grill WM, Mortimer JT |title=Stimulus waveforms for selective neural stimulation |journal=IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=375–385 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DPPs may be of either the voltage or current stimulus variety and have been used to inhibit neural activity,&lt;ref name=Grill /&gt; selectively excite neurons,&lt;ref name=Grill2 /&gt; and increase the pain threshold associated with electrocutaneous stimulation.&lt;ref name=Poletto /&gt;

==Biophysical mechanisms==

===Hodgkin–Huxley model===

Typical [[action potential]]s are initiated by [[Sodium channel#Voltage-gated sodium channels|voltage-gated sodium channels]].  As the [[Membrane potential|transmembrane voltage]] is increased the probability that a given voltage gated sodium channel is open is increased, thus enabling an influx of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.  Once the sodium inflow becomes greater than the potassium outflow, a [[positive feedback]] loop of sodium entry is closed and thus an action potential is fired.

In the early 1950s Drs. [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]] performed experiments on the [[squid giant axon]], and in the process developed a model (the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]]) for sodium channel conductance.  It was found that the conductance may be expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt;{g}_{Na^+} = \bar{g}_{Na^+} m^3h,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{g}_{Na^+}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum sodium conductance, ''m'' is the activation gate, and ''h'' is the inactivation gate (both gates are shown in the adjacent image).&lt;ref name=Hodgkin&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hodgkin AL, Huxley AF |title=A quantitative description of ion currents and its applications to conduction and excitation in nerve membranes |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=500–544 |year=1952 |pmid=12991237 |pmc=1392413 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004764}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The values of ''m'' and ''h'' vary between 0 and 1, depending upon the transmembrane potential.

[[Image:Depolarizing Prepulse.PNG|left|thumb|upright=2|Transmembrane voltage response of a space-clamped mammalian [[Nodes of Ranvier|node of Ranvier]]]]

As the [[Membrane potential|transmembrane potential]] rises, the value of ''m'' increases, thus increasing the probability that the activation gate will be open.  And as the transmembrane potential drops, the value of ''h'' increases, along with the probability that the inactivation gate will be open. The rate of change for an ''h'' gate is much slower than that of an ''m'' gate, therefore if one precedes a sub-threshold voltage stimulation with a [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarizing]] prepulse, the value of ''h'' may be temporarily increased, enabling the neuron to fire an action potential.

Vice versa, if one precedes a supra-threshold voltage stimulation with a [[Depolarization|depolarizing]] prepulse, the value of ''h'' may be temporarily reduced, enabling the inhibition of the neuron. An illustration of how the transmembrane voltage response to a supra-threshold stimulus may differ, based upon the presence of a depolarizing prepulse, may be observed in the adjacent image.

The Hodgkin–Huxley model is slightly inaccurate as it fudges over some dependencies, for example the inactivation gate should not be able to close unless the activation gate is open and the inactivation gate, once closed, is located inside the [[cell membrane]] where it cannot be directly affected by the transmembrane potential.&lt;ref name=Dayan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dayan |first1=Peter |last2=Abbott |first2=Larry |title=Theoretical Neuroscience |year=2001 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-262-04199-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this model is useful for gaining a high level understanding of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing prepulses. Depolarizing neurons creates a more likely out come of the neuron firing.

===Voltage-gated sodium channel===

[[File:Sodium-channel.svg|thumb|500px|Diagram of a voltage-sensitive sodium channel &amp;alpha;-subunit. G - [[glycosylation]], P - [[phosphorylation]], S - ion selectivity, I - inactivation, positive (+) charges in S4 are important for transmembrane voltage sensing.]]

Since the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] was first proposed in the 1950s, much has been learned concerning the structure and functionality of voltage-gated [[sodium channel]]s.  Although the exact three dimensional structure of the [[sodium channel]] remains unknown, its composition and the functionality of individual components have been determined. Voltage-gated sodium channels are large, [[Protein subunit|multimeric]] complexes, composed of a single α subunit and one or more β subunits, an illustration of which may be observed in the adjacent image.  The α subunit folds into four homologous domains, each of which contain six α-[[Helix|helical]] transmembrane segments.&lt;ref name=Catterall&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)81133-2 |author=Catterall WA |title=From ionic currents to molecular mechanisms: the structure and function of voltage-gated sodium channels |journal=Neuron |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=13–25 |year=2000 |pmid=10798388}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; segments of each domain serve as voltage sensors for activation.  Each S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; segment consists of a repeating structure of one positively charged [[Residue (chemistry)|residue]] and two [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] residues, and these combine to form a helical arrangement.  When the channel is [[Depolarization|depolarized]] these S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; segments undergo a conformational change that widens the helical arrangement and opens the sodium-channel [[Ion channel pore|pore]].  Within milliseconds after the pore’s opening, the intracellular loop that connects domains III and IV, binds to the channel’s intracellular pore, inactivating the channel.&lt;ref name=Yu&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/gb-2003-4-3-207 |vauthors=Yu FH, Catterall WA |title=Overview of the voltage-gated sodium channel family |journal=Genome Biology |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=207 |year=2003 |pmid=12620097 |pmc=153452}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, by providing a depolarizing prepulse before a stimulus, there is a greater probability that the inactivating domains of the sodium channels have bound to their respective pores, reducing the stimulus induced sodium influx and the influence of the stimulus.

==Depolarizing prepulse properties==

===DPP duration===

The relationship between the DPP duration and neuronal recruitment is as follows.  If the duration of the DPP is relatively short, i.e. much less than 100 μs, then the threshold of excitation for the surrounding nerves will be decreased as opposed to increased.  Possibly resulting from the depolarization of the S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; segments and the little time given for inactivation.  For long duration DPP’s the III and IV domains of the sodium channels (discussed above) are given more time to bind with their respective channel pores, thus the threshold current is observed to increase with an increasing DPP duration.&lt;ref name=Grill2 /&gt;

===DPP amplitude===

As the DPP amplitude is increased from zero to near threshold, the resulting increase in threshold current will grow as well.&lt;ref name=Grill2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vuckovic&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1741-2560/5/3/002 |vauthors=Vuckovic A, Tosato M, Struijk JJ |title=A comparative study of three techniques for diameter selective fiber activation in the vagal nerve: anodal block, depolarizing prepulses and slowly rising pulses |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=275–286 |journal=Journal of Neural Engineering |year=2008 |pmid=18566504}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because the higher amplitude activates more sodium channels, thus allowing more channels to become inactivated by their III and IV domains.

===DPP inter-phase delay===

An increase in the delay between the DPP and the stimulus provides more time during which the sodium channel S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; segments may close and the III and IV domains may detach themselves from their respective pores.  Thus, an increase in the DPP inter-phase delay will reduce the effective increase in threshold current, induced by the DPP.&lt;ref name=Grill2 /&gt;

==Depolarizing prepulse applications==

===Elevating pain thresholds===

One immediate application for [[Depolarization|depolarizing]] prepulses, explored by Drs. Poletto and Van Doren, is to elevate the pain thresholds associated with electrocutaneous stimulation.&lt;ref name=Poletto&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TBME.2002.803563 |vauthors=Poletto CJ, Van Doren CL |title=Elevating Pain Thresholds in Humans Using Depolarizing Prepulses |journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering |volume=49 |issue=10 |pages=1221–1224 |year=2002 |pmid=12374350}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrocutaneous stimulation possesses a great deal of potential as a mechanism for the conveyance of additional sensory information.  Hence, this method of stimulation may be directly applied to fields such as [[virtual reality]], [[sensory substitution]], and sensory augmentation .  However, many of these applications require the use of small [[Multielectrode array|electrode arrays]], stimulation through which is often painful, thus limiting the usefulness of this technology.  The experimental setup, constructed by Drs. Poletto and Van Doren, was as follows:

[[Image:Poletto 2002 pain plot 2.PNG|right|thumb|upright=2|Mean proportions of stimuli perceived as painful v. stimulus prepulse]]

*4 human subjects, each of which had demonstrated the ability to provide reliable pain judgments in previous studies
*left middle finger rests on a 1&amp;nbsp;mm diameter polished stainless steel disk [[electrode]]s
*a single stimulus consisted of a burst of three identical prepulse and stim-pulse pairs, presented at the beginning, middle, and end of a 1-second interval
*the prepulse and stim-pulse widths were matched at a duration of 10 milliseconds so that the thresholds would be the same for both
*used varying prepulse amplitudes of 0%, 79%, 63%, 50%, 40%, and 32% so as to study their influence over the pain experienced
*the experiments were conducted in such a way that the stimulus, without a prepulse was painful for about half of the time; this was achieved by stepping the stim-pulse amplitude up and down for the next trial, based upon whether it was reported as painful

Their results demonstrated that a prepulse before a stimulus pulse effectively reduces the probability that pain will be experienced due to electrocutaneous stimulation.  Surprisingly enough, a prepulse of 32% of the amplitude of the stimulus pulse was able to nearly half the probability of experiencing pain.  Therefore, in environments in which the pain threshold is difficult to discern, it may be sufficient to deliver a relatively low amplitude prepulse before the stimulus to achieve the desired effects.

===Nerve fiber recruitment order===

[[Image:Nerve Fiber Recruitment Inversion Plot.png|left|thumb|upright=1.6|Based upon the data presented in&lt;ref name=Grill2 /&gt;]]

In addition to inhibiting neural excitability, it has been observed that preceding an electrical stimulus with a depolarizing prepulse allows one to invert the current-distance relationship controlling [[Axon|nerve fiber]] recruitment, where the current-distance relationship describes how the threshold current for nerve fiber excitation is proportional to the square of the distance between the nerve fiber and the electrode.&lt;ref name=Grill2 /&gt;  Therefore, if the region of influence for the depolarizing prepulse is less than that for the stimulus, the nerve fibers closer to the electrode will experience a greater increase in their threshold current for excitation.  Thus, provided such a stimulus, the nerve fibers closest to the electrode may be inhibited, while those further away may be excited.&lt;ref name=Grill2&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/10.553708 |vauthors=Grill WM, Mortimer JT |title=Inversion of the current-distance relationship by transient depolarization |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering |year=1997 |pmid=9214779}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Deurloo&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s004220100253 |vauthors=Deurloo KE, Holsheimer J, Bergveld P |title=The effect of subthreshold prepulses on the recruitment order in a nerve trunk analyzed in a simple and realistic volume conductor model |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=281–291 |journal=Biological Cybernetics |year=2001 |pmid=11592625}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A simulation of this stimulation, constructed by Drs. Warren Grill and J. Thomas Mortimer, may be observed in the adjacent image.  Building upon this, a stimulus with two depolarizing prepulses, each of an amplitude slightly below the threshold current (at the time of delivery), should increase the radii of influence for nearby nerve fiber inactivation and distant nevre fiber excitation.

Typically, nerve fibers of a larger diameter may be activated by single-pulse stimuli of a lower intensity, and thus may be recruited more readily.&lt;ref name=Grill /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grill2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hennings&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2006.10.017 |vauthors=Hennings K, Kamavuako EN, Farina D |title=The recruitment order of electrically activated motor neurons investigated with a novel collision technique |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=283–291 |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |year=2007 |pmid=17174598}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, DPPs have demonstrated the additional capability to invert this recruitment order.  As electrical stimuli have a greater effect over nerve fibers of a larger diameter, DPPs will in turn cause a larger degree of sodium conductance inactivation within such nerve fibers, thus nerve fibers of a smaller diameter will have a lower threshold current.

{{Tanakh OT |Ketuvim |WP}}

'''Ecclesiastes ''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˌ|k|l|iː|z|i|ˈ|æ|s|t|iː|z}}; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Ἐκκλησιαστής, ''Ekklēsiastēs'', {{lang-he-n|קֹהֶלֶת}}, ''qōheleṯ'') is one of 24 books of the [[Tanakh]] or [[Hebrew Bible]], where it is classified as one of the ''[[Ketuvim]]'' (or "Writings"). Originally written c. 450–200 BCE, it is also among the canonical [[Sapiential books|Wisdom Books]] in the [[Old Testament]] of most [[Christian denominations|denominations of Christianity]]. The title ''Ecclesiastes'' is a Latin [[transliteration]] of the Greek translation of the Hebrew '''Kohelet''', the [[pseudonym]] used by the author of the book.

In traditional Jewish texts, [[King Solomon]] is named as the author, although modern scholars reject this. Textually, the book is the musings of a King of Jerusalem as he relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical. The author, who is not named anywhere in the book, or in the whole of the Bible, introduces a "teacher" whom he identifies as the son of David (1:1). The author does not use his own "voice" throughout the book again until the final verses (12:9–14), where he gives his own thoughts and summarises what "the teacher" has spoken.

The teacher discusses the [[meaning of life]] and the best way to live. He proclaims all the actions of man to be inherently ''[[wikt:הבל|hevel]]'', meaning "vain" or "futile", ("mere breath"), as both the wise and the foolish end their lives in death. Kohelet clearly endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life. In light of this senselessness, one should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life, such as eating, drinking, and taking enjoyment in one's work, which are gifts from the hand of God. The book concludes with the injunction: "Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone" (12:13).

Ecclesiastes has had a deep influence on Western literature. It contains several phrases that have resonated in British and American culture, and was quoted by [[Abraham Lincoln]] addressing Congress in 1862. American novelist [[Thomas Wolfe]] wrote:
{{quotation | "[O]f all I have ever seen or learned, that book seems to me the noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man's life upon this earth—and also the highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth. I am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary creation, but if I had to make one I could say that Ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound."{{sfn|Christianson|2007|p=70}} }}

==Structure==
Ecclesiastes is presented as biography of "Kohelet" (or "Qoheleth", meaning "Gatherer", but traditionally translated as "Teacher" or "Preacher"{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}}). Kohelet's story is framed by voice of the narrator, who refers to Kohelet in the third person, praises his wisdom, but reminds the reader that wisdom has its limitations and is not man's main concern. Kohelet reports what he planned, did, experienced and thought. His journey to knowledge is, in the end, incomplete. The reader is not only to hear Kohelet's wisdom, but to observe his journey towards understanding and acceptance of life's frustrations and uncertainties: the journey itself is important.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiii}}

Few of the many attempts to uncover an underlying structure to Ecclesiastes have met with widespread acceptance; among them, the following is one of the more influential:{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xvi}}
* Title (1:1)
* Initial poem (1:2–11)
* I: Kohelet's investigation of life (1:12–6:9)
* II: Kohelet's conclusions (6:10–11:6)
** Introduction (6:10–12)
** A: Man cannot discover what is good for him to do (7:1–8:17)
** B: Man does not know what will come after him (9:1–11:6)
* Concluding poem (11:7–12:8)
* Epilogue (12:9–14)
Verse 1:1 is a superscription, the ancient equivalent of a title page: it introduces the book as "the words of Kohelet, son of David, king in Jerusalem."{{sfn|Longman|1998|pp=57–59}}

Most, though not all, modern commentators regard the epilogue (12:9–14) as an addition by a later scribe. Some have identified certain other statements as further additions intended to make the book more religiously orthodox (e.g., the affirmations of God's justice and the need for piety).{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xvii}}

==Summary==
The ten-verse introduction in verses 1:2–11 are the words of the frame narrator; they set the mood for what is to follow: Kohelet's message is that all is meaningless.{{sfn|Longman|1998|pp=57–59}}

After the introduction come the words of Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is to partake of life in the present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. The world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.{{sfn|Seow|2007|pp=946–57}}

The frame narrator returns with an epilogue: the words of the wise are hard, but they are applied as the shepherd applies goads and pricks to his flock. The original ending of the book was probably the words: "The end of the matter" (12:13) but the text we have continues: "Fear God" (a phrase used often in Kohelet's speech) "and keep his commandments" (which he never uses), "for God will bring every deed to judgement."{{sfn|Seow|2007|pp=957–58}}

The book takes its name from the Greek ''ekklesiastes'', a translation of the title by which the central figure refers to himself: ''Kohelet'', meaning something like "one who convenes or addresses an assembly".{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|pp=124–25}} According to rabbinic tradition, Ecclesiastes was written by [[Solomon]] in his old age.{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=11}} (An alternative tradition that "[[Hezekiah]] and his colleagues wrote [[Isaiah]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], the [[Song of Songs]] and Ecclesiastes" probably means simply that the book was edited under Hezekiah.){{sfn|Smith|2007|p=692}} Nevertheless, critical scholars have long rejected the idea of a pre-exilic origin.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=x}}{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|pp=50–52}} The presence of [[Old Persian|Persian]] loan-words and [[Imperial Aramaic|Aramaisms]] points to a date no earlier than about 450 BCE,{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}} while the latest possible date for its composition is 180 BCE, when another Jewish writer, [[Ben Sira]], quotes from it.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiv}} The dispute as to whether Ecclesiastes belongs to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] or the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] periods (i.e., the earlier or later part of this period) revolves around the degree of [[Hellenization]] (influence of Greek culture and thought) present in the book. Scholars arguing for a Persian date (c. 450–330 BCE) hold that there is a complete lack of Greek influence;{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}} those who argue for a Hellenistic date (c. 330–180 BCE) argue that it shows internal evidence of Greek thought and social setting.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|pp=54–55}}

Also unresolved is whether the author and narrator of Kohelet are one and the same person. Ecclesiastes regularly switches between third-person quotations of Kohelet and first-person reflections on Kohelet’s words, which would indicate the book was written as a commentary on Kohelet’s parables rather than a personally-authored repository of his sayings. Some scholars have argued that the third-person narrative structure is an artificial literary device along the lines of [[Uncle Remus]], although the description of the Teacher in 12:8–14 seems to favour a historical person whose thoughts are presented by the narrator.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=48}} The question, however, has no theological importance,{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=48}} and one scholar (Roland Murphy) has commented that Kohelet himself would have regarded the time and ingenuity put into interpreting his book as "one more example of the [[fatalism|futility of human effort]]".{{sfn|Ingram|2006|p=45}}

===Genre and setting===
Ecclesiastes has taken its literary form from the Middle Eastern tradition of the fictional autobiography, in which a character, often a king, relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical: Kohelet likewise identifies himself as a king, speaks of his search for wisdom, relates his conclusions, and recognises his limitations.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiii}} It belongs to the category of [[wisdom literature]], the body of biblical writings which give advice on life, together with reflections on its problems and meanings—other examples include the [[Book of Job]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], and some of the [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]]. Ecclesiastes differs from the other biblical Wisdom books in being deeply skeptical of the usefulness of Wisdom itself.{{sfn|Brettler|2007|p=721}} Ecclesiastes in turn influenced the [[deuterocanonical]] works, [[Wisdom of Solomon]] and [[Sirach]], both of which contain vocal rejections of the Ecclesiastical philosophy of futility.

Wisdom was a popular genre in the ancient world, where it was cultivated in scribal circles and directed towards young men who would take up careers in high officialdom and royal courts; there is strong evidence that some of these books, or at least sayings and teachings, were translated into Hebrew and influenced the Book of Proverbs, and the author of Ecclesiastes was probably familiar with examples from Egypt and Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Fox|2004|pp=x–xi}} He may also have been influenced by Greek philosophy, specifically the schools of [[Stoicism]], which held that all things are fated, and [[Epicureanism]], which held that happiness was best pursued through the quiet cultivation of life's simpler pleasures.{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|p=125}}

===Canonicity===
The presence of Ecclesiastes in the Bible is something of a puzzle, as the common themes of the Hebrew canon—a God who reveals and redeems, who elects and cares for a chosen people—are absent from it, which suggests that Kohelet had lost his faith in his old age. Understanding the book was a topic of the earliest recorded discussions (the hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] in the 1st century CE). One argument advanced then was that the name of Solomon carried enough authority to ensure its inclusion, but other works which appeared with Solomon's name were excluded despite being more orthodox than Ecclesiastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=Canon|date=1752|pages=601–04|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.did2222.0000.566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was that the words of the epilogue, in which the reader is told to fear God and keep his commands, made it orthodox; but all later attempts to find anything in the rest of the book which would reflect this orthodoxy have failed. A modern suggestion treats the book as a dialogue in which different statements belong to different voices, with Kohelet himself answering and refuting unorthodox opinions, but there are no explicit markers for this in the book, as there are, for example in the [[Book of Job]]. Yet another suggestion is that Ecclesiastes is simply the most extreme example of a tradition of skepticism, but none of the proposed examples match Ecclesiastes for a sustained denial of faith and doubt in the goodness of God. "In short, we do not know why or how this book found its way into such esteemed company," summarizes Martin A. Shields in his 2006 book ''The End of Wisdom: A Reappraisal of the Historical and Canonical Function of Ecclesiastes''{{sfn|Shields|2006|pp=1-5}}

==Themes==
Scholars disagree about the themes of Ecclesiastes. Is it positive and life-affirming, or deeply pessimistic?{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=17}} Is Kohelet coherent or incoherent, insightful or confused, orthodox or heterodox? Is the ultimate message of the book to copy Kohelet, the wise man, or to avoid his errors?{{sfn|Enns|2011|p=21}} At times Kohelet raises deep questions; he "doubted every aspect of religion, from the very ideal of righteousness, to the by now traditional idea of divine justice for individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Doubt: A History|last=Hecht|first=Jennifer Michael|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2003|isbn=978-0-06-009795-0|location=New York|pages=75|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some passages of Ecclesiastes seem to contradict other portions of the Old Testament, and even itself.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=17}} One suggestion for resolving the contradictions is to read the book as the record of Kohelet's quest for knowledge: opposing judgments (e.g., "the dead are better off than the living" (4:2) vs. "a living dog is better off than a dead lion" (9:4)) are therefore provisional, and it is only at the conclusion that the verdict is delivered (11–12:7). On this reading, Kohelet's sayings are goads, designed to provoke dialogue and reflection in his readers, rather than to reach premature and self-assured conclusions.{{sfn|Brown|2011|pp=17–18}}

The subjects of Ecclesiastes are the pain and frustration engendered by observing and meditating on the distortions and inequities pervading the world, the uselessness of human deeds, and the limitations of wisdom and righteousness. The phrase "under the sun" appears thirty times in connection with these observations; all this coexists with a firm belief in God, whose power, justice and unpredictability are sovereign.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=ix}} History and nature move in cycles, so that all events are predetermined and unchangeable, and life has no meaning or purpose: the wise man and the man who does not study wisdom will both die and be forgotten: man should be reverent ("Fear God"), but in this life it is best to simply enjoy God's gifts.{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|p=125}}

==Judaism==
In Judaism, Ecclesiastes is read either on [[Shemini Atzeret]] (by Yemenites, Italians, some [[Sepharadim]], and the mediaeval French Jewish rite) or on the [[Shabbat]] of the Intermediate Days of [[Sukkot]] (by [[Ashkenazim]]). If there is no Intermediate Sabbath of [[Sukkot]], even the Ashkenazim read it on [[Shemini Atzeret]] (or, for Ashkenazim in the Land of Israel, on the first [[Shabbat]] of Sukkot). It is read on Sukkot as a reminder to not get too caught up in the festivities of the holiday, as well as to carry over the happiness of Sukkot to the rest of the year by telling the listeners that, without God, life is meaningless. When the listeners take this to heart, then true happiness can be achieved throughout the year.

The final poem of Kohelet ({{Bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|12:1–8|HE}}) has been interpreted in the [[Targum]], Talmud and [[Midrash]], and by the rabbis [[Rashi]], [[Rashbam]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra|ibn Ezra]], as an allegory of old age.

==Catholicism==
Ecclesiastes has been cited in the writings of past and current [[Roman Catholic|Catholic Church]] leaders. For example, [[doctors of the Church]] have cited Ecclesiastes. [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]] cited Ecclesiastes in Book XX of ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120120.htm The City of God, Book XX]. Accessed 2015-06-28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Jerome]] wrote a commentary on Ecclesiastes.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, [http://www.paulistpress.com/Products/0601-1/66-st-jerome-commentary-on-ecclesiastes.aspx Commentary on Ecclesiastes]. Accessed 2015-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] cited Ecclesiastes ("The number of fools is infinite.") in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/aquinas/summa/sum071.htm#FP_Q63_A9-p3.1 Summa Theologica]. Accessed 2015-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The twentieth-century Catholic theologian and cardinal-elect [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] discusses Ecclesiastes in his work on theological aesthetics, ''The Glory of the Lord''. He describes Qoheleth as "a [[transcendental idealism|critical transcendentalist]] ''avant la lettre''", whose God is distant from the world, and whose ''[[kairos]]'' is a "form of time which is itself empty of meaning". For Balthasar, the role of Ecclesiastes in the Biblical canon is to represent the "final dance on the part of wisdom, [the] conclusion of the ways of man", a logical end-point to the unfolding of human wisdom in the Old Testament that paves the way for the advent of the New.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Balthasar|first=Hans Urs|title=The Glory of the Lord. Volume VI: Theology: The Old Covenant|year=1991|publisher=T&amp;T Clark|location=Edinburgh|translator=Brian McNeil and Erasmo Leiva-Merikakis|pages=137–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book continues to be cited by recent [[pope]]s, including [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Pope Francis]]. Pope John Paul II, in his general audience of October 20, 2004, called the author of Ecclesiastes "an ancient biblical sage" whose description of death "makes frantic clinging to earthly things completely pointless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manhardt|first=Laurie|title=Come and See: Wisdom of the Bible|year=2009|publisher=Emmaus Road Publishing|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T6g1uStpp4kC&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781931018555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis cited Ecclesiastes on his address on September 9, 2014. Speaking of vain people, he said, "How many Christians live for appearances? Their life seems like a [[soap bubble]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pope Francis, [http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/09/25/pope_francis_vain_christians_are_like_soap_bubbles/1107284 "Pope Francis: Vain Christians are like soap bubbles"]. Accessed 2015-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Western literature==
Ecclesiastes has had a deep influence on Western literature. It contains several phrases that have resonated in British and American culture, such as "eat, drink and be merry," "nothing new under the sun," "a time to be born and a time to die," and "vanity of vanities; all is [[vanity]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirsch|first=E.D.|title=The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy|year=2002|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAzOg4eQl2YC&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=0618226478}}&lt;/ref&gt;  American novelist [[Thomas Wolfe]] wrote: "[O]f all I have ever seen or learned, that book seems to me the noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man's life upon this earth—and also the highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth. I am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary creation, but if I had to make one I could say that Ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound."{{sfn|Christianson|2007|p=70}}

* [[Abraham Lincoln]] quoted Ecclesiastes 1:4 in his address to the reconvening Congress on December 1, 1862, during the darkest hours of the [[American Civil War]]: "'One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.' ...

'''Electroblotting''' is a method in [[molecular biology]]/[[biochemistry]]/[[immunogenetics]] to transfer [[proteins]] or [[nucleic acids]] onto a membrane by using [[PVDF]] or  [[nitrocellulose]], after [[gel electrophoresis]].&lt;ref name="Sheehan2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Sheehan|title=Physical Biochemistry: Principles and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AxxbYlsuZrwC&amp;pg=PT206|date=30 April 2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-68748-2|pages=206–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bansal2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

This method can be used with all polyacrylamide and agarose gels. An alternative technique for transferring proteins from a gel is capillary blotting.

==Development==
This technique was patented in 1989 by William J. Littlehales under the title "Electroblotting technique for transferring specimens from a polyacrylamide electrophoresis or like gel onto a membrane.&lt;ref name="Dubey2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=R C Dubey|title=Advanced Biotechnology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKgrDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199|year=2014|publisher=S.

==Electroblotting procedure==
This technique relies upon current and a transfer buffer solution to drive proteins or nucleic acids onto a membrane. Following electrophoresis, a standard tank or semi-dry blotting transfer system is set up. A stack is put together in the following order from cathode to anode: sponge | three sheets of filter paper soaked in transfer buffer | gel | PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane | three sheets of filter paper soaked in transfer buffer | sponge. It is a necessity that the membrane is located between the gel and the positively charged anode, as the current and sample will be moving in that direction. Once the stack is prepared, it is placed in the transfer system, and a current of suitable magnitude is applied for a suitable period of time according to the materials being used.

Typically the electrophoresis gel is stained with [[Coomassie Brilliant Blue]] following the transfer to ensure that a sufficient quantity of material has been transferred. Because the proteins may retain or regain part of their structure during blotting they may react with specific [[antibodies]] giving rise to the term [[immunoblotting]]. Alternatively the proteins may react with [[ligand]]s like [[lectin]]s giving rise to the term [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] blotting.

[[File:Bob Moog3.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Moog]], inventor of the [[Moog synthesizer]]]]
An '''electronic musical instrument''' is a [[musical instrument]] that produces sound using [[electronics|electronic circuitry]]. Such an instrument sounds by outputting an electrical, electronic or digital [[audio signal]] that ultimately is plugged into a [[power amplifier]] which drives a [[loudspeaker]], creating the sound heard by the performer and listener.

An electronic instrument might include a [[user interface]] for controlling its sound, often by adjusting the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[frequency]], or duration of each [[Musical note|note]]. A common user interface is the [[musical keyboard]], which functions similarly to the keyboard on an acoustic [[piano]], except that with an electronic keyboard, the keyboard itself does not make any sound. An electronic keyboard sends a signal to a [[synth module]], [[computer]] or other electronic or digital sound generator, which then creates a sound. However, it is increasingly common to separate user interface and sound-generating functions into a [[MIDI controller|music controller]] ([[input device]]) and a [[music synthesizer]], respectively, with the two devices communicating through a musical performance description language such as [[MIDI]] or [[Open Sound Control]].

All electronic musical instruments can be viewed as a subset of [[audio signal processing]] applications. Simple electronic musical instruments are sometimes called [[sound effect]]s; the border between sound effects and actual musical instruments is often unclear.

In the 2010s, electronic musical instruments are now widely used in most styles of music. In popular music styles such as [[electronic dance music]], almost all of the instrument sounds used in recordings are electronic instruments (e.g., [[bass synth]], [[synthesizer]], [[drum machine]]). Development of new electronic musical instruments, controllers, and synthesizers continues to be a highly active and interdisciplinary field of research. Specialized conferences, notably the International Conference on [[New Interfaces for Musical Expression]], have organized to report cutting-edge work, as well as to provide a showcase for artists who perform or create music with new electronic music instruments, controllers, and synthesizers.

[[Image:Clavecin électrique.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the clavecin électrique]]
In the 18th-century, musicians and composers adapted a number of acoustic instruments to exploit the novelty of electricity. Thus, in the broadest sense, the first electrified musical instrument was the [[Denis d'or]] keyboard, dating from 1753, followed shortly by the [[clavecin électrique]] by the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste de Laborde in 1761. The Denis d'or consisted of a keyboard instrument of over 700 strings, electrified temporarily to enhance sonic qualities. The clavecin électrique was a keyboard instrument with [[plectrum|plectra]] (picks) activated electrically. However, neither instrument used electricity as a sound-source.

The first electric synthesizer was invented in 1876 by [[Elisha Gray]].&lt;ref name="elisha"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Musical Telegraph" was a chance by-product of his telephone technology when Gray accidentally discovered that he could control sound from a self-vibrating electromagnetic circuit and so invented a basic [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. The Musical Telegraph used steel reeds oscillated by electromagnets and transmitted over a telephone line. Gray also built a simple loudspeaker device into later models, which consisted of a diaphragm vibrating in a magnetic field.

A significant invention, which later had a profound effect on electronic music, was the [[audion]] in 1906. This was the first thermionic valve, or [[vacuum tube]] and which led to the generation and amplification of electrical signals, radio broadcasting, and electronic computation, among other things. Other early synthesizers included the [[Telharmonium]] (1897), the [[Theremin]] (1919), Jörg Mager's [[Spharophon]] (1924) and Partiturophone, Taubmann's similar [[Electronde]] (1933), [[Maurice Martenot]]'s [[ondes Martenot]] ("Martenot waves", 1928), Trautwein's [[Trautonium]] (1930). The Mellertion (1933) used a non-standard scale, Bertrand's Dynaphone could produce octaves and perfect fifths, while the Emicon was an American, keyboard-controlled instrument constructed in 1930 and the German Hellertion combined four instruments to produce chords. Three Russian instruments also appeared, Oubouhof's [[Croix Sonore]] (1934),  [[Ivor Darreg]]'s [[microtonal music|microtonal]] 'Electronic Keyboard Oboe' (1937) and the [[ANS synthesizer]], constructed by the Russian scientist [[Evgeny Murzin]] from 1937 to 1958. Only two models of this latter were built and the only surviving example is currently stored at the Lomonosov University in [[Moscow]]. It has been used in many Russian movies—like ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]''—to produce unusual, "cosmic" sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Hugh Le Caine]], John Hanert, [[Raymond Scott]], composer [[Percy Grainger]] (with Burnett Cross), and others built a variety of automated electronic-music controllers during the late 1940s and 1950s. In 1959 [[Daphne Oram]] produced a novel method of synthesis, her "[[Oramics]]" technique, driven by drawings on a 35&amp;nbsp;mm film strip; it was used for a number of years at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Telharmonium ===
&lt;div style="clear:right;float:right;"&gt;
[[Image:Teleharmonium1897.jpg|thumb|center|160px|Telharmonium console &lt;br/&gt;by [[Thaddeus Cahill]] 1897]]&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Telharmonium}}
In 1897 [[Thaddeus Cahill]] patented an instrument called the Telharmonium (or Teleharmonium, also known as the Dynamaphone). Using [[tonewheel]]s to generate musical sounds as electrical signals by [[additive synthesis]], it was capable of producing any combination of notes and overtones, at any dynamic level. This technology was later used to design the [[Hammond organ]]. Between 1901 and 1910 Cahill had three progressively larger and more complex versions made, the first weighing seven tons, the last in excess of 200 tons. Portability was managed only by rail and with the use of thirty boxcars. By 1912, public interest had waned, and Cahill's enterprise was bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Weidenaar|first = Reynold|date = 1995|title = Magic Music from the Telharmonium|location=Metuchen, New Jersey|publisher= Scarecrow Press|isbn =9780810826922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another development, which aroused the interest of many composers, occurred in 1919-1920. In Leningrad, Leon Theremin (actually [[Lev Termen]]) built and demonstrated his Etherophone, which was later renamed the [[Theremin]]. This led to the first compositions for electronic instruments, as opposed to noisemakers and re-purposed machines.  The Theremin was notable for being the first musical instrument played without touching it. In 1929, [[Joseph Schillinger]] composed ''First Airphonic Suite for Theremin and Orchestra'', premièred with the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] with [[Leon Theremin]] as soloist. The next year [[Henry Cowell]] commissioned Theremin to create the first electronic rhythm machine, called the [[Rhythmicon]]. Cowell wrote some compositions for it, and he and Schillinger premiered it in 1932.

=== Ondes Martenot ===
&lt;div style="clear:right;float:right;"&gt;
[[Image:Ondes martenot.jpg|thumb|center|160px|Ondes Martenot (ca.1974, &lt;br/&gt;7th generation model)]]&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Ondes Martenot}}
The 1920s have been called the apex of the Mechanical Age and the dawning of the Electrical Age. In 1922, in Paris, [[Darius Milhaud]] began experiments with "vocal transformation by phonograph speed change."&lt;ref name = "tvnpyt"&gt;Herbert Russcol, ''The Liberation of Sound: An Introduction to Electronic Music'' ( Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1972): 68.&lt;/ref&gt; These continued until 1927. This decade brought a wealth of early electronic instruments&amp;mdash;along with the Theremin, there is the presentation of the [[Ondes Martenot]], which was designed to reproduce the microtonal sounds found in Hindu music, and the [[Trautonium]].
Maurice Martenot invented the Ondes Martenot in 1928, and soon demonstrated it in Paris. Composers using the instrument ultimately include [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]], [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]], [[André Jolivet|Jolivet]], [[Charles Koechlin|Koechlin]], [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], [[Gilles Tremblay (composer)|Tremblay]], and [[Edgard Varèse|Varèse]]. [[Radiohead]] guitarist and multi-instrumentalist [[Jonny Greenwood]] also uses it in his compositions and a plethora of Radiohead songs. In 1937, Messiaen wrote ''Fête des belles eaux'' for 6 ondes Martenot, and wrote solo parts for it in ''[[Trois petites Liturgies de la Présence Divine]]'' (1943&amp;ndash;44) and the ''[[Turangalîla-Symphonie]]'' (1946&amp;ndash;48/90).

=== Trautonium ===
&lt;div style="clear:right;float:right;"&gt;
[[Image:Volkstrautonium MIM.jpg|thumb|center|160px|Volks Trautonium (1933, Telefunken Ela T 42)]]&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Trautonium}}
The Trautonium was invented in 1928. It was based on the [[subharmonic]] scale, and the resulting sounds were often used to emulate bell or gong sounds, as in the 1950s Bayreuth productions of ''[[Parsifal]]''. In 1942, Richard Strauss used it for the bell- and gong-part in the Dresden première of his ''Japanese Festival Music''.  This new class of instruments, microtonal by nature, was only adopted slowly by composers at first, but by the early 1930s there was a burst of new works incorporating these and other electronic instruments.

{{main|Hammond organ|Novachord}}
In 1929 [[Laurens Hammond]] established his company for the manufacture of electronic instruments. He went on to produce the [[Hammond organ]], which was based on the principles of the [[Telharmonium]], along with other developments including early reverberation units.&lt;ref&gt;Russcol 1972, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hammond organ is an electromechanical instrument, as it used both mechanical elements and electronic parts. A Hammond organ used spinning metal tonewheels to produce different sounds. A [[magnetic pickup]] similar in design to the pickups in an [[electric guitar]] is used to transmit the pitches in the tonewheels to an amplifier and speaker enclosure. While the Hammond organ was designed to be a lower-cost alternative to a [[pipe organ]] for church music, musicians soon discovered that the Hammond was an excellent instrument for [[blues]] and [[jazz]]; indeed, an entire genre of music developed built around this instrument, known as the [[organ trio]] (typically Hammond organ, drums, and a third instrument, either saxophone or guitar).

The first commercially manufactured synthesizer was the [[Novachord]], built by the [[Hammond Organ]] Company from 1938 to 1942, which offered 72-note [[Polyphony (instrument)|polyphony]] using 12 oscillators driving [[monostable]]-based divide-down circuits, basic [[envelope generator|envelope]] control and resonant [[low-pass filter]]s. The instrument featured 163 vacuum tubes and weighed 500 pounds. The instrument's use of envelope control is significant, since this is perhaps the most significant distinction between the modern synthesizer and other electronic instruments.

{{Main|Analog synthesizer|Synthesizer}}

The most commonly used electronic instruments are [[synthesizer]]s, so-called because they artificially generate sound using a variety of techniques. All early circuit-based synthesis involved the use of analogue circuitry, particularly voltage controlled amplifiers, oscillators and filters. An important technological development was the invention of the [[Clavivox]] [[synthesizer]] in 1956 by [[Raymond Scott]] with subassembly by [[Robert Moog]]. French [[composer]] and engineer [[Edgard Varèse]] created a variety of compositions using [[electronic horn]]s, whistles, and tape. Most notably, he wrote ''[[Poème électronique]]'' for the Phillips pavilion at the [[Expo '58|Brussels World Fair]] in 1958.

=== Modular synthesizers ===
{{main|Modular synthesizer}}
[[RCA]] produced experimental devices to synthesize voice and music in the 1950s.  The [[RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer|Mark II Music Synthesizer]], housed at the [[Computer Music Center|Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center]] in [[New York City]]. Designed by Herbert Belar and Harry Olson at RCA, with contributions from Vladimir Ussachevsky and Peter Mauzey, it was installed at Columbia University in 1957. Consisting of a room-sized array of interconnected sound synthesis components, it was only capable of producing music by programming,&lt;ref name="beginnings"/&gt; using a [[paper tape]] [[Music sequencer|sequencer]] punched with holes to control pitch sources and filters, similar to a mechanical [[player piano]] but capable of generating a wide variety of sounds. The [[vacuum tube]] system had to be patched to create timbres.

[[Image:Bob Moog3.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Moog]]
In the 1960s synthesizers were still usually confined to studios due to their size. They were usually modular in design, their stand-alone signal sources and processors connected with patch cords or by other means and controlled by a common controlling device. [[Harald Bode]], [[Don Buchla]], [[Hugh Le Caine]], [[Raymond Scott]] and [[Paul Ketoff]] were among the first to build such instruments, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Buchla later produced a commercial modular synthesizer, the [[Buchla|Buchla Music Easel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Moog established standards for control interfacing, using a logarithmic 1-volt-per-octave for pitch control and a separate triggering signal. This standardization allowed synthesizers from different manufacturers to operate simultaneously. Pitch control was usually performed either with an organ-style keyboard or a [[music sequencer]] producing a timed series of control voltages. During the late 1960s hundreds of popular recordings used Moog synthesizers. Other early commercial synthesizer manufacturers included [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP]], who also started with modular synthesizers before producing all-in-one instruments, and British firm [[Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd|EMS]].

===Integrated synthesizers===

In 1970, Moog designed the [[Minimoog]], a non-modular synthesizer with a built-in keyboard. The analogue circuits were interconnected with switches in a simplified arrangement called "normalization." Though less flexible than a modular design, normalization made the instrument more portable and easier to use. The [[Minimoog]] sold 12,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Polyphony===
{{main|Polyphony (instrument)#Synthesizer}}
Many early analog synthesizers were monophonic, producing only one tone at a time. Popular monophonic synthesizers include the Moog [[Minimoog]]. A few, such as the Moog Sonic Six, [[ARP Odyssey]] and EML 101, could produce two different pitches at a time when two keys were pressed.  [[Polyphony (instrument)|Polyphony]] (multiple simultaneous tones, which enables [[Chord (music)|chords]]) was only obtainable with electronic organ designs at first. Popular electronic keyboards combining organ circuits with synthesizer processing included the ARP Omni and Moog's Polymoog and Opus 3.

By 1976 affordable polyphonic synthesizers began to appear, notably the Yamaha CS-50, CS-60 and [[Yamaha CS-80|CS-80]], the [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5]] and the [[Oberheim]] Four-Voice. These remained complex, heavy and relatively costly. The recording of settings in digital memory allowed storage and recall of sounds. The first practical polyphonic synth, and the first to use a microprocessor as a controller, was the [[Sequential Circuits]] [[Prophet-5]] introduced in late 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The Prophet-5's design paradigm became a new standard, slowly pushing out more complex and recondite modular designs.

{{main|Magnetophon|Musique concrète|Multitrack recording|Chamberlin|Mellotron}}
In 1935, another significant development was made in Germany. Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft (AEG) demonstrated the first commercially produced [[magnetic tape recorder]], called the ''[[Magnetophon]]''.  [[Magnetic tape sound recording|Audio tape]], which had the advantage of being fairly light as well as having good audio fidelity, ultimately replaced the bulkier wire recorders.

The term "electronic music" (which first came into use during the 1930s) came to include the tape recorder as an essential element: "electronically produced sounds recorded on tape and arranged by the composer to form a musical composition"&lt;ref&gt;"Electronic music": [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/electronic%20music Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc.]  (accessed: August 19, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; It was also indispensable to [[Musique concrète]].

Tape also gave rise to the first, analogue, sample-playback keyboards, the [[Chamberlin]] and its more famous successor the [[Mellotron]], an electro-mechanical, polyphonic keyboard originally developed and built in Birmingham, England in the early 1960s.

{{main|Music sequencer}}
During the 1940s&amp;ndash;1960s, [[Raymond Scott]], an American composer of electronic music, invented various kind of music sequencers for his electric compositions. Step sequencers played rigid patterns of notes using a grid of (usually) 16 buttons, or steps, each step being 1/16 of a [[bar (music)|measure]]. These patterns of notes were then chained together to form longer compositions. Software sequencers were continuously utilized since the 1950s in the context of [[computer music]], including computer-''played'' music (software sequencer), computer-''composed'' music ([[algorithmic music|music synthesis]]), and computer ''sound generation'' ([[sound synthesis]]).

[[Frequency modulation synthesis|FM synthesis]] was developed for this purpose; as a way of generating complex sounds digitally with the smallest number of computational operations per sound sample. In 1983 [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] introduced the first stand-alone digital synthesizer, the [[DX-7]]. It used frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis), first developed by [[John Chowning]] at [[Stanford University]] during the late sixties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last =Chowning|first = John M.|date = September 1973|title = The Synthesis of Complex Audio Spectra by Means of Frequency Modulation|journal = Journal of the Audio Engineering Society|pages = 526–534|volume = 21|number =7|url = https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/course/100/misc/chowning-73-tso.pdf}}

{{main|Computer music|Software synthesizer}}
An important new development was the advent of computers for the purpose of composing music, as opposed to manipulating or creating sounds. [[Iannis Xenakis]] began what is called ''musique stochastique,'' or ''[[stochastic music]]'', which is a method of composing that employs mathematical probability systems. Different probability algorithms were used to create a piece under a set of parameters. Xenakis used graph paper and a ruler to aid in calculating the velocity trajectories of [[glissando|glissandi]] for his orchestral composition ''Metastasis'' (1953&amp;ndash;54), but later turned to the use of computers to compose pieces like ''ST/4'' for string quartet and ''ST/48'' for orchestra (both 1962).

The impact of computers continued in 1956. [[Lejaren Hiller]] and [[Leonard Issacson]] composed ''[[Illiac Suite]]'' for [[string quartet]], the first complete work of computer-assisted composition using [[algorithm]]ic composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Schwartz|first = Elliot|date =1975|title= Electronic Music: A Listener's Guide|publisher = Praeger|page = 88|isbn =  9780275537302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, [[Max Mathews]] at [[Bell Lab]] wrote [[MUSIC-N]] series, a first computer program family for generating digital audio waveforms through direct synthesis.  Then [[Barry Vercoe]] wrote [[MUSIC-N|MUSIC 11]] based on [[Music 4|MUSIC IV-BF]], a next-generation music synthesis program (later evolving into [[csound]], which is still widely used).

In mid 80s, [[Miller Puckette]] at [[IRCAM]] developed graphic signal-processing software for [[Sogitec 4X|4X]] called [[Max (software)|Max]] (after [[Max Mathews]]), and later ported it to [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] (with [[Dave Zicarelli]] extending it for [[Opcode Systems|Opcode]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Ozab|first = David |url = http://www.atpm.com/6.05/barline.shtml |title = Beyond the Barline|website = ATPM|date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for real-time [[MIDI]] control, bringing algorithmic composition availability to most composers with modest computer programming background.

=== MIDI ===
[[Image:Midiaansl.jpg|thumb|MIDI, a LAN for music, enables connections between digital musical instruments]]
{{main|Musical Instrument Digital Interface}}
In 1980, a group of musicians and music merchants met to standardize an interface by which new instruments could communicate control instructions with other instruments and the prevalent microcomputer. This standard was dubbed MIDI ([[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]]). A paper was authored by [[Dave Smith (engineer)|Dave Smith]] of [[Sequential Circuits]] and proposed to the [[Audio Engineering Society]] in 1981. Then, in August 1983, the MIDI Specification 1.0 was finalized.

The advent of MIDI technology allows a single keystroke, control wheel motion, pedal movement, or command from a microcomputer to activate every device in the studio remotely and in synchrony, with each device responding according to conditions predetermined by the composer.

MIDI instruments and software made powerful control of sophisticated instruments easily affordable by many studios and individuals. Acoustic sounds became reintegrated into studios via [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and sampled-ROM-based instruments.

The increasing power and decreasing cost of sound-generating electronics (and especially of the personal computer), combined with the standardization of the [[MIDI]] and [[Open Sound Control]] musical performance description languages, has facilitated the separation of musical instruments into music controllers and music synthesizers.

By far the most common musical controller is the [[musical keyboard]]. Other controllers include the [[radiodrum]], Akai's [[EWI (musical instrument)|EWI]] and Yamah's [[Yamaha WX5|WX]] wind controllers, the guitar-like [[SynthAxe]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303052323/http://www.synthzone.com/bsynth.html BodySynth], the [[Buchla Thunder]], the [[Continuum (instrument)|Continuum Fingerboard]], the [[Roland Octapad]], various [[isomorphic keyboards]] including the [[Thummer]], and [[Kaossilator|Kaossilator Pro]], and kits like [[I-CubeX]].

[[Image:Reactable Multitouch.jpg|thumb|160px|Reactable]]&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Reactable}}
The Reactable is a round translucent table with a [[backlight|backlit]] interactive display. By placing and manipulating blocks called ''tangibles'' on the table surface, while interacting with the visual display via finger gestures, a [[Virtuality|virtual]] [[modular synthesizer]] is operated, creating music or sound effects.

===Percussa AudioCubes===
&lt;div style="clear:right;float:right;margin:0 0 -3.3ex 0;"&gt;
[[Image:Detailed view of Audiocubes.jpg|thumb|160px|Audiocubes]]&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Audiocubes}}
AudioCubes are autonomous wireless cubes powered by an internal computer system and rechargeable battery. They have internal RGB lighting, and are capable of detecting each other's location, orientation and distance. The cubes can also detect distances to the user's hands and fingers. Through interaction with the cubes, a variety of music and sound software can be operated. AudioCubes have applications in sound design, music production, DJing and live performance.

===Kaossilator===
&lt;div style="clear:right;float:right;margin:0 0 -3.3ex 0;"&gt;
[[Image:KORG Kaossilator.jpg|thumb|120px|Korg Kaossilator]]&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|Kaossilator}}
The Kaossilator and Kaossilator Pro are compact instruments where the position of a finger on the touch pad controls two note-characteristics; usually the pitch is changed with a left-right motion and the tonal property, filter or other parameter changes with an up-down motion.  The touch pad can be set to different musical scales and keys.  The instrument can record a repeating loop of adjustable length, set to any tempo, and new loops of sound can be layered on top of existing ones.  This lends itself to electronic dance-music but is more limited for controlled sequences of notes, as the pad on a regular Kaossilator is featureless.

===Eigenharp===
{{main|Eigenharp}}
The Eigenharp is a large instrument resembling a [[bassoon]], which can be interacted with through big buttons, a drum sequencer and a mouthpiece. The sound processing is done on a separate computer.

===XTH Sense===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
The XTH Sense is a wearable instrument that uses muscle sounds from the human body (known as [[mechanomyogram]]) to make music and sound effects. As a performer moves, the body produces muscle sounds that are captured by a chip microphone worn on arm or legs. The muscle sounds are then live sampled using a dedicated software program and a library of modular audio effects. The performer controls the live sampling parameters by weighing force, speed and articulation of the movement.

===AlphaSphere===
&lt;div style="clear:right;float:right;margin:0 0 -3.3ex 0;"&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:AlphaSphere nexus.png|thumb|160px|[[AlphaSphere (instrument)|AlphaSphere]]]] --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
{{main|AlphaSphere (instrument)}}
The AlphaSphere is a spherical instrument that consists of 48 tactile pads that respond to pressure as well as touch. Custom software allows the pads to be indefinitely programmed individually or by groups in terms of function, note, and pressure parameter among many other settings. The primary concept of the AlphaSphere is to increase the level of expression available to electronic musicians, by allowing for the playing style of a musical instrument.

==Chip music==
{{main|Chiptune}}
{{see also|Video game music}}
[[Chiptune]], chipmusic, or chip music is music written in sound formats where many of the sound textures are synthesized or sequenced in real time by a [[computer]] or [[video game console]] [[sound chip]], sometimes including sample-based synthesis and low bit sample playback. Many chip music devices featured synthesizers in tandem with low rate sample playback.

==DIY culture==
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[DIY]] (Do it yourself) designs were published in hobby electronics magazines (notably the Formant modular synth, a DIY clone of the Moog system, published by [[Elektor]]) and kits were supplied by companies such as Paia in the US, and Maplin Electronics in the UK.

===Circuit bending===
[[File:Bending.jpg|thumb|160px|Probing for "good bends" using a jeweler's screwdriver and alligator clips.]]
{{main|Circuit bending}}

In 1966, [[Reed Ghazala]] discovered and began to teach math "[[circuit bending]]"&amp;mdash;the application of the creative short circuit, a process of chance short-circuiting, creating experimental electronic instruments, exploring sonic elements mainly of timbre and with less regard to pitch or rhythm, and influenced by [[John Cage]]’s [[aleatoric music]] concept.&lt;ref name="circuit"&gt;{{cite web

  |quote     = This element of embracing errors is at the centre of Circuit Bending, it is about creating sounds that are not supposed to happen and not supposed to be heard (Gard, 2004). In terms of musicality, as with electronic art music, it is primarily concerned with timbre and takes little regard of pitch and rhythm in a classical sense. ... . In a similar vein to Cage’s aleatoric music, the art of Bending is dependent on chance, when a person prepares to bend they have no idea of the final outcome.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this manipulation of circuits directly, especially to the point of destruction, was pioneered by [[Louis and Bebe Barron]] in the early 1950s, such as their work with [[John Cage]] on the ''[[Williams Mix]]'' and especially in the soundtrack to [[Forbidden Planet]].

Modern [[circuit bending]] is the creative customization of the circuits within electronic devices such as low [[voltage]], battery-powered [[guitar effects]], children's [[toy]]s and small digital [[synthesizer]]s to create new musical or visual instruments and sound generators. Emphasizing spontaneity and randomness, the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with [[noise music]], though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with "bent" instruments. Circuit bending usually involves dismantling the machine and adding components such as switches and [[potentiometer]]s that alter the circuit. With the revived interest for analogue synthesizer circuit bending became a cheap solution for many experimental musicians to create their own individual analogue sound generators. Nowadays many schematics can be found to build noise generators such as the [[Atari Punk Console]] or the [[Dub Siren]] as well as simple modifications for children toys such as the famous [[Speak &amp; Spell (toy)|Speak &amp; Spell]]s that are often modified by circuit benders.

===Modular synthesizers===
{{main|Modular synthesizer}}
The modular synthesizer is a type of synthesizer consisting of separate interchangeable modules. These are also available as  kits for hobbyist DIY constructors. Many hobbyist designers also make available bare PCB boards and front panels for sale to other hobbyists.

{{Original research|date=October 2016}}

'''Empirical evidence''' is the [[information]] received by means of the [[senses]], particularly by [[observation]] and documentation of patterns and behavior through [[experiment]]ation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pickett|2006|p=585}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word for experience, ἐμπειρία (''empeiría''). 

After [[Immanuel Kant]], in philosophy, it is common to call the knowledge gained ''[[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'' knowledge]]'' (in contrast to ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' knowledge).

==Meaning==
Empirical evidence is information that verifies the [[truth]] (which accurately corresponds to reality) or falsity (inaccuracy) of a claim. In the [[empiricism|empiricist]] view, one can claim to have knowledge only when based on empirical evidence (although some empiricists believe that there are other ways of gaining knowledge). This stands in contrast to the [[rationalism|rationalist]] view under which [[reason]] or reflection alone is considered evidence for the truth or falsity of some [[proposition]]s.&lt;ref name="cdp"&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|2001|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical evidence is information acquired by observation or experimentation. This data is recorded and analyzed by scientists.  This is the primary source of empirical evidence. Secondary sources describe, discuss, interpret, comment upon, analyze, evaluate, summarize, and process primary sources. Secondary source materials can be articles in newspapers or popular magazines, book or movie reviews, or articles found in scholarly journals that discuss or evaluate someone else's original research.&lt;ref name="cdp" /&gt;

Empirical evidence may be synonymous with the outcome of an experiment. In this regard, an empirical result is a unified confirmation. In this context, the term ''semi-empirical'' is used for qualifying theoretical methods that use, in part, basic [[axiom]]s or postulated scientific laws and experimental results. Such methods are opposed to theoretical ''[[ab initio]]'' methods, which are purely [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] and based on [[first principle]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In [[science]], empirical evidence is required for a hypothesis to gain acceptance in the [[scientific community]].  Normally, this validation is achieved by the [[scientific method]] of forming a [[hypothesis]], [[design of experiments|experimental design]], [[peer review]], [[Scientific Method#Reproducibility|reproduction of results]], conference presentation, and [[Scientific literature|journal publication]]. This requires rigorous communication of hypothesis (usually expressed in mathematics), experimental constraints and controls (expressed necessarily in terms of standard experimental apparatus), and a common understanding of measurement.

[[Statement (logic)|Statements]] and [[argument]]s depending on empirical evidence are often referred to as ''[[a posteriori]]'' ("following experience") as distinguished from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' (preceding it). ''A priori'' knowledge or justification is independent of experience (for example "All bachelors are unmarried"), whereas ''a posteriori'' knowledge or justification is dependent on experience or empirical evidence (for example "Some bachelors are very happy"). The notion that the distinction between ''a posteriori'' and ''a priori'' is tantamount to the distinction between empirical and non-empirical knowledge comes from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]].''&lt;ref name=Craig2005&gt;{{harvnb|Craig|2005|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard [[positivism|positivist]] view of empirically acquired information has been that observation, experience, and experiment serve as neutral arbiters between competing theories. However, since the 1960s, a persistent critique most associated with [[Thomas Kuhn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2014}} has argued that these methods are influenced by prior beliefs and experiences. Consequently, it cannot be expected that two scientists when observing, experiencing, or experimenting on the same event will make the same theory-neutral observations. The role of observation as a theory-neutral arbiter may not be possible. Theory-dependence of observation means that, even if there were agreed methods of inference and interpretation, scientists may still disagree on the nature of empirical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bird|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erotic target location error''' ('''ETLE''') is having a sexual preference or strong sexual interest in features that are somewhere other than on one's sexual partners.&lt;ref name = Lawrence2009&gt;{{Cite journal

When one's sexual arousal is based on imagining oneself in another physical form (such as an animal, an infant, or an amputee) the erotic target is said to be one's self, or erotic target identity inversion.&lt;ref name = Blanchard&gt;{{Cite journal

The terms "erotic target location error" and "erotic target identity inversion" were first used in 1993 by [[sexologist]] [[Ray Blanchard]].&lt;ref name =Blanchard/&gt;

== Types ==
The best known examples of erotic target identity inversions are biological males who experience sexual arousal in response to imagining themselves as women (called [[autogynephilia]]), but at least one case of anatomic [[autoandrophilia]] has also been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'' (1990) by [[Naomi Wolf]], Wolf writes, "Women tell me they're jealous of the men who get so much pleasure from the female body; that they imagine being inside the male body that is inside their own so that they can vicariously experience desire."&lt;ref name="Wolf1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Naomi Wolf|title=The Beauty Myth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0naAAAAMAAJ|year=1990|pages=127–|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|isbn=978-0-7011-3431-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas [[gynephilia]] refers to the sexual preference for women, autogynephilia refers to a male's sexual interest in being a woman.  Autogynephilia can be associated with [[gender dysphoria]] and [[gender identity disorder]], discontent with one's biological sex and the desire to undergo [[sex reassignment surgery|surgery for sex reassignment]] and permanently take on a role and life of the other sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Several other sexual interests also exist in ETLE forms:

== Sexuality in subcultures ==
There are many subcultures of people who are interested in transforming themselves to various degrees and interacting in their new role or identity.  Such interactions can include sexual interactions with other members of the community.  There is debate in these communities regarding whether their desire to transform is based on their sexual interests in the new form or based on [[autozoophilia|feeling like they are part animal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Winterman | first = D | title = What are the furries? | publisher = [[BBC News]] | accessdate = 2012-08-07 | date = 2009-11-13 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8355287.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In a letter to the editor of ''[[The Journal of Sex Research]],'' San Francisco-based physician and activist [[Charles Allen Moser]] criticized Lawrence' endorsement of the concept of ETLEs.&lt;ref name = MoserResponse&gt;{{Cite journal

Lawrence responded that "Moser's critiques of the paraphilias rely on fallacious reasoning" and that "most of his other criticism...results from his having ignored or misinterpreted my statements, either inadvertently or for rhetorical purposes." She indicated that "Moser correctly observed that such an unwarranted generalization would lead to ludicrous conclusions; but these would be wholly attributable to Moser's ludicrous misinterpretation of what I actually wrote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lawrence | first1 = A.

'''Fire ecology''' is a scientific discipline concerned with natural processes involving [[fire]] in an [[ecosystem]] and the [[ecology|ecological]] effects, the interactions between fire and the abiotic and biotic components of an ecosystem, and the role as an ecosystem process. Many ecosystems, particularly [[prairie]], [[savanna]], [[chaparral]] and [[coniferous forest]]s, have evolved with fire as an essential contributor to [[habitat]] vitality and renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780128027493|title=The Ecological Importance of Mixed-Severity Fires -  ScienceDirect|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many plant species in  fire-affected environments require fire to germinate, establish, or to reproduce.  [[Wildfire suppression]] not only eliminates these species, but also the animals that depend upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutto|first=Richard L.|date=2008-12-01|title=The Ecological Importance of Severe Wildfires: Some Like It Hot|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/08-0895.1/abstract|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1827–1834|doi=10.1890/08-0895.1|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of wildfire suppression in the United States|Campaigns in the United States]] have historically molded public opinion to believe that [[wildfire]]s are always harmful to nature. This view is based on the outdated belief that ecosystems progress toward an equilibrium and that any disturbance, such as fire, disrupts the harmony of nature. More recent ecological research has shown, however, that fire is an integral component in the function and [[biodiversity]] of many natural habitats, and that the organisms within these communities have adapted to withstand, and even to exploit, natural wildfire.  More generally, fire is now regarded as a 'natural disturbance', similar to [[flood]]ing, [[Storm|wind-storms]], and [[landslide]]s, that has driven the evolution of species and controls the characteristics of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11134082|title=The ecology of natural disturbance and patch dynamics|date=1985|publisher=Academic Press|others=Pickett, Steward T., 1950-, White, P. S.|isbn=0125545207|location=Orlando, Fla.|oclc=11134082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fire suppression, in combination with other human-caused environmental changes, may have resulted in unforeseen consequences for natural ecosystems. Some large wildfires in the United States have been blamed on years of fire suppression and the continuing expansion of people into fire-adapted ecosystems, but [[climate change]] is more likely responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westerling|first=A.

==Fire components==

A [[fire regime]] describes the characteristics of fire and how it interacts with a particular ecosystem.&lt;ref name=Whitlock2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitlock|first=Cathy|author2=Higuera, P.E.|author3=McWethy, D.B.|author4=Briles, C.E.|title=Paleoecological Perspectives on Fire Ecology: Revisiting the Fire-Regime Concept|journal=Open Journal of Ecology|year=2010|volume=3|pages=6–23|url=http://www.benthamscience.com/open/toecolj/articles/V003/S10001TOECOLJ/6TOECOLJ.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2013|doi=10.2174/1874213001003020006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130222755/http://www.benthamscience.com/open/toecolj/articles/V003/S10001TOECOLJ/6TOECOLJ.pdf|archivedate=30 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its "severity" is a term that ecologists use to refer to the impact that a fire has on an ecosystem. Ecologists can define this in many ways, but one way is through an estimate of plant mortality. Fire can burn at three levels. Ground fires will burn through soil that is rich in organic matter. Surface fires will burn through dead plant material that is lying on the ground. Crown fires will burn in the tops of shrubs and trees. Ecosystems generally experience a mix of all three.&lt;ref name="BondKeeley2005" /&gt;

Fires will often break out during a dry season, but in some areas wildfires may also commonly occur during a time of year when lightning is prevalent. The frequency over a span of years at which fire will occur at a particular location is a measure of how common wildfires are in a given ecosystem. It is either defined as the average interval between fires at a given site, or the average interval between fires in an equivalent specified area.&lt;ref name="BondKeeley2005"&gt;Bond and Keeley 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Defined as the energy released per unit length of fireline (kW m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), wildfire intensity can be estimated either as

* the product of 
**the linear spread rate (m s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), 
** the low heat of combustion (kJ kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;),
**  and the combusted fuel mass per unit area, 
*or it can be estimated from the flame length.&lt;ref name="Byram1959"&gt;Byram, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abiotic responses==
Fires can affect soils through heating and combustion processes. Depending on the temperatures of the soils caused by the combustion processes, different effects will happen- from evaporation of water at the lower temperature ranges, to the combustion of soil organic matter and formation of pyrogenic organic matter, otherwise known as charcoal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santín|first=Cristina|last2=Doerr|first2=Stefan H.|date=2016-06-05|title=Fire effects on soils: the human dimension|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1696/20150171|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B|language=en|volume=371|issue=1696|pages=20150171|doi=10.1098/rstb.2015.0171|issn=0962-8436|pmid=27216528|pmc=4874409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fires can cause changes in soil nutrients through a variety of mechanisms, which include oxidation, volatilization, erosion, and leaching by water, but the event must usually be of high temperatures in order of significant loss of nutrients to occur. However, quantity of nutrients available in soils are usually increased due to the ash that is generated, and this is made quickly available, as opposed to the slow release of nutrients by decomposition.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pivello|first=Vânia Regina|last2=Oliveras|first2=Imma|last3=Miranda|first3=Heloísa Sinátora|last4=Haridasan|first4=Mundayatan|last5=Sato|first5=Margarete Naomi|last6=Meirelles|first6=Sérgio Tadeu|date=2010-12-01|title=Effect of fires on soil nutrient availability in an open savanna in Central Brazil|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-010-0508-x|journal=Plant and Soil|language=en|volume=337|issue=1–2|pages=111–123|doi=10.1007/s11104-010-0508-x|issn=0032-079X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock spalling (or [[Spall#Exfoliation|thermal exfoliation]]) accelerates weathering of rock and potentilly the release of some nutrients.

Increase in the pH of the soil following a fire is commonly observed, most likely due to the formation of calcium carbonate, and the subsequent decomposition of this calcium carbonate to calcium oxide when temperatures get even higher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It could also be due to the increased cation content in the soil due to the ash, which temporarily increases soil pH. Microbial activity in the soil might also increase due to the heating of soil and increased nutrient content in the soil, though studies have also found complete loss of microbes on the top layer of soil after a fire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mataix-Solera|first=J.|last2=Cerdà|first2=A.|last3=Arcenegui|first3=V.|last4=Jordán|first4=A.|last5=Zavala|first5=L.M.|title=Fire effects on soil aggregation: A review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012825211001322|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|language=en|volume=109|issue=1–2|pages=44–60|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.08.002|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, soils become more [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] (higher pH) following fires because of [[acid]] combustion. By driving novel chemical reactions at high temperatures, fire can even alter the [[Soil#Texture|texture]] and [[Soil#Structure|structure of soils]] by affecting the clay content and the [[Soil#Porosity|soil's porosity]].

Removal of vegetation following a fire can cause several effects on the soil, such as increasing the temperatures of the soil during the day due to increased solar radiation on the soil surface, and greater cooling due to loss of radiative heat at night. Fewer leaves to intercept rain will also cause more rain to reach the soil surface, and with fewer plants to absorb the water, the amount of water content in the soils might increase. However, it might be seen that ash can be water repellent when dry, and therefore water content and availability might not actually increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robichaud|first=Peter R.|last2=Wagenbrenner|first2=Joseph W.|last3=Pierson|first3=Fredrick B.|last4=Spaeth|first4=Kenneth E.|last5=Ashmun|first5=Louise E.|last6=Moffet|first6=Corey A.|title=Infiltration and interrill erosion rates after a wildfire in western Montana, USA|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0341816216300431|journal=CATENA|language=en|volume=142|pages=77–88|doi=10.1016/j.catena.2016.01.027|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biotic responses and adaptations==
{{See also|Fire adaptations}}

===Plants===
[[Image:LodgepolePine 6915.jpg|right|thumb|Lodgepole pine cones]]
Plants have evolved many [[adaptation]]s to cope with fire.  Of these adaptations, one of the best-known is likely ''[[serotiny|pyriscence]]'', where maturation and release of seeds is triggered, in whole or in part, by fire or smoke; this behaviour is often erroneously called ''serotiny'', although this term truly denotes the much broader category of seed release activated by any stimulus.  All pyriscent plants are serotinous, but not all serotinous plants are pyriscent (some are necriscent, hygriscent, xeriscent, soliscent, or some combination thereof).  On the other hand, [[germination]] of seed activated by trigger is not to be confused with pyriscence; it is known as ''physiological dormancy''.

In [[chaparral]] communities in Southern [[California]], for example, some plants have leaves coated in flammable oils that encourage an intense fire.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/fire/wildland-fire/learning-center/fire-in-depth/different-ecosystems/chaparral-sw.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; This heat causes their fire-activated seeds to germinate (an example of dormancy) and the young plants can then capitalize on the lack of [[competition (biology)|competition]] in a burnt landscape. Other plants have smoke-activated seeds, or fire-activated buds. The cones of the [[Lodgepole pine]] (''Pinus contorta'') are, conversely, pyriscent: they are sealed with a resin that a fire melts away, releasing the seeds.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;USDA Forest Service&lt;/ref&gt; Many plant species, including the shade-intolerant [[giant sequoia]] (''Sequoiadendron giganteum''), require fire to make gaps in the vegetation canopy that will let in light, allowing their seedlings to compete with the more shade-tolerant seedlings of other species, and so establish themselves.&lt;ref name="USNPS"&gt;US National Park Service&lt;/ref&gt; Because their stationary nature precludes any fire avoidance, plant species may only be fire-intolerant, fire-tolerant or fire-resistant.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"&gt;Kramp ''et al.'' 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fire intolerance====
Fire-intolerant plant species tend to be highly flammable and are destroyed completely by fire. Some of these plants and their seeds may simply fade from the community after a fire and not return; others have adapted to ensure that their offspring survives into the next generation. "Obligate seeders" are plants with large, fire-activated seed banks that germinate, grow, and mature rapidly following a fire, in order to reproduce and renew the seed bank before the next fire.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KnoxClarke2005"&gt;Knox and Clarke 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
Seeds may contain the receptor protein KAI2, that is activated by the growth hormones [[karrikin]] released by the fire.&lt;ref name="Salk"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salk.edu/news/pressrelease_details.php?press_id=613 | title=Smoke signals: How burning plants tell seeds to rise from the ashes | publisher=Salk Institute for Biological Studies | work=Salik researchers | date=April 29, 2013 | accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Eucalypt trees, Australia, 15 months after a bushfire.jpg|right|thumb|Fire tolerance. Typical regrowth after an Australian bushfire]]

====Fire tolerance====
Fire-tolerant species are able to withstand a degree of burning and continue growing despite damage from fire. These plants are sometimes referred to as "[[resprouter]]s." Ecologists have shown that some species of resprouters store extra energy in their roots to aid recovery and re-growth following a fire.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KnoxClarke2005"/&gt; For example, after an [[Bushfires in Australia|Australian bushfire]], the [[Mountain Grey Gum]] tree (''Eucalyptus cypellocarpa'') starts producing a mass of shoots of leaves from the base of the tree all the way up the trunk towards the top, making it look like a black stick completely covered with young, green leaves.

====Fire resistance====
Fire-resistant plants suffer little damage during a characteristic fire regime. These include large trees whose flammable parts are high above surface fires. Mature [[ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') is an example of a tree species that suffers virtually no crown damage under a naturally mild fire regime, because it sheds its lower, vulnerable branches as it matures.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pyne2002"&gt;Pyne 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animals, birds and microbes===
[[Image:Fire hawks.jpg|right|thumb|A mixed flock of hawks hunting in and around a bushfire]]
Like plants, animals display a range of abilities to cope with fire, but they differ from most plants in that they must avoid the actual fire to survive. Although [[bird]]s are vulnerable when nesting, they are generally able to escape a fire; indeed they often profit from being able to take prey fleeing from a fire and to recolonize burned areas quickly afterwards. Some anthropological and ethno-ornithological evidence suggests that certain species of fire-foraging raptors may engage in intentional fire propagation to flush out prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gosford|first1=Robert|title=Ornithogenic Fire: Raptors as Propagators of Fire in the Australian Savanna|journal=2015 Raptor Research Foundation Annual Conference, Nov 4 – 8 , Sacramento, California|date=Nov 2015|url=http://www.raptorresearchfoundation.org/files/2015/11/2015_conference_program.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonta|first1=Mark|title=Intentional fire-spreading by "firehawk" raptors in Northern Australia|journal=Journal of Ethnobotany|date=2017|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2993/0278-0771-37.4.700|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mammal]]s are often capable of fleeing a fire, or seeking cover if they can burrow. [[Amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s may avoid flames by burrowing into the ground or using the burrows of other animals. Amphibians in particular are able to take refuge in water or very wet mud.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"/&gt; Some [[arthropod]]s also take shelter during a fire, although the heat and smoke may actually attract some of them, to their peril.&lt;ref name="DeBano1998"&gt;DeBano ''et al.'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microbial]] organisms in the soil vary in their heat tolerance but are more likely to be able to survive a fire the deeper they are in the soil. A low fire intensity, a quick passing of the flames and a dry soil will also help. An increase in available nutrients after the fire has passed may result in larger microbial communities than before the fire.&lt;ref name="Hart2005"&gt;Hart ''et al.'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The generally greater heat tolerance of bacteria relative to fungi makes it possible for soil microbial population diversity to change following a fire, depending on the severity of the fire, the depth of the microbes in the soil, and the presence of plant cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersson|first1=Michael|title=Tropical savannah woodland: effects of experimental fire on soil microorganisms and soil emissions of carbon dioxide|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|date=5 May 2014|volume=36|issue=5|pages=849–858|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2004.01.015|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071704000513|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain species of fungi, such as ''Cylindrocarpon destructans'' appear to be unaffected by combustion contaminants, which can inhibit re-population of burnt soil by other microorganisms, and therefore have a higher chance of surviving fire disturbance and then recolonizing and out-competing other fungal species afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Widden|first1=P|title=The effects of a forest fire on soil microfungi|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|date=March 1975|volume=7|issue=2|pages=125–138|doi=10.1016/0038-0717(75)90010-3.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire and ecological succession==
Fire behavior is different in every ecosystem and the organisms in those ecosystems have adapted accordingly. One sweeping generality is that in all ecosystems, fire creates a mosaic of different [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] patches, with areas ranging from those having just been burned to those that have been untouched by fire for many years. This is a form of [[ecological succession]] in which a freshly burned site will progress through continuous and directional phases of colonization following the destruction caused by the fire.&lt;ref name="Begon1996p692"&gt;Begon ''et al.'' 1996, pg. 692&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecologists usually characterize succession through the changes in vegetation that successively arise. After a fire, the first species to re-colonize will be those with seeds are already present in the soil, or those with seeds are able to travel into the burned area quickly. These are generally fast-growing [[herbaceous]] plants that require light and are intolerant of shading. As time passes, more slowly growing, shade-tolerant woody species will suppress some of the herbaceous plants.&lt;ref name="Begon1996p700"&gt;Begon ''et al.'' 1996, pg 700&lt;/ref&gt; Conifers are often early successional species, while broad leaf trees frequently replace them in the absence of fire. Hence, many conifer forests are themselves dependent upon recurring fire.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007"&gt;Keddy 2007, Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Different species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting different stages in this process of succession, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape. Soil characteristics will be a factor in determining the specific nature of a fire-adapted ecosystem, as will climate and topography.

==Some examples of fire in different ecosystems==

===Forests===
Mild to moderate fires burn in the [[forest]] [[understory]], removing small trees and herbaceous [[groundcover]]. High-severity fires will burn into the crowns of the trees and kill most of the dominant vegetation. Crown fires may require support from ground fuels to maintain the fire in the forest canopy (passive crown fires), or the fire may burn in the canopy independently of any ground fuel support (an active crown fire). High-severity fire creates [[complex early seral forest]] habitat, or [[snag forest]] with high levels of biodiversity. When a forest burns frequently and thus has less plant litter build-up, below-ground soil temperatures rise only slightly and will not be lethal to roots that lie deep in the soil.&lt;ref name="DeBano1998"/&gt; Although other characteristics of a forest will influence the impact of fire upon it, factors such as [[climate]] and [[topography]] play an important role in determining fire severity and fire extent.&lt;ref name="BeatyTaylor2001"&gt;Beaty and Taylor (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Fires spread most widely during drought years, are most severe on upper slopes and are influenced by the type of vegetation that is growing.

====Forests in British Columbia====
In [[Canada]], forests cover about 10% of the land area and yet harbor 70% of the country’s bird and terrestrial mammal species. Natural fire regimes are important in maintaining a diverse assemblage of [[vertebrate]] species in up to twelve different forest types in [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Bunnell1995"&gt;Bunnell (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Different species have adapted to exploit the different stages of succession, regrowth and habitat change that occurs following an episode of burning, such as downed trees and debris. The characteristics of the initial fire, such as its size and intensity, cause the habitat to evolve differentially afterwards and influence how vertebrate species are able to use the burned areas.&lt;ref name="Bunnell1995" /&gt;

===Shrublands===
[[File:2011-08-04 20 00 00 Susie Fire in the Adobe Range west of Elko Nevada.jpg|thumb|Lightning-sparked wildfires are frequent occurrences on shrublands and grasslands in [[Nevada]].]]
[[Shrub]] fires typically concentrate in the canopy and spread continuously if the shrubs are close enough together. [[Shrubland]]s are typically dry and are prone to accumulations of highly volatile fuels, especially on hillsides. Fires will follow the path of least moisture and the greatest amount of dead fuel material. Surface and below-ground soil temperatures during a burn are generally higher than those of forest fires because the centers of combustion lie closer to the ground, although this can vary greatly.&lt;ref name="DeBano1998"/&gt; Common plants in shrubland or chaparral include [[manzanita]], [[Adenostoma fasciculatum|chamise]] and [[Coyote Brush]].

====California shrublands====
California shrubland, commonly known as [[chaparral]], is a widespread plant community of low growing species, typically on arid sloping areas of the [[California Coast Ranges]] or western foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. There are a number of common shrubs and tree shrub forms in this association, including [[salal]], [[toyon]], [[Rhamnus californica|coffeeberry]] and [[Western poison oak]].&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan (2008) [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 "Western poison-oak: Toxicodendron diversilobum"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721044257/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 |date=July 21, 2009 }}, GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Strömberg&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration following a fire is usually a major factor in the association of these species.

====South African Fynbos shrublands====
[[Fynbos]] shrublands occur in a small belt across [[South Africa]]. The plant species in this ecosystem are highly diverse, yet the majority of these species are obligate seeders, that is, a fire will cause germination of the seeds and the plants will begin a new life-cycle because of it. These plants may have [[Coevolution|coevolved]] into obligate seeders as a response to fire and nutrient-poor soils.&lt;ref name="Wisheu2000"&gt;Wisheu ''et al.'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Because fire is common in this ecosystem and the soil has limited nutrients, it is most efficient for plants to produce many seeds and then die in the next fire. Investing a lot of energy in roots to survive the next fire when those roots will be able to extract little extra benefit from the nutrient-poor soil would be less efficient. It is possible that the rapid generation time that these obligate seeders display has led to more rapid [[evolution]] and [[speciation]] in this ecosystem, resulting in its highly diverse plant community.&lt;ref name="Wisheu2000" /&gt;

===Grasslands===
[[Grasslands]] burn more readily than forest and shrub ecosystems, with the fire moving through the stems and leaves of herbaceous plants and only lightly heating the underlying soil, even in cases of high intensity. In most grassland ecosystems, fire is the primary mode of [[decomposition]], making it crucial in the [[nutrient cycle|recycling of nutrients]].&lt;ref name="DeBano1998"/&gt; It has been hypthesized that fire only recently became the primary mode of decomposition in many grassland ecosystems after the removal or extinction of large migratory herds of browsing or grazing megafauna driven by predator pressure. In this view, in the absence of functional communities of large migratory herds of herbivorous megafauna and attendant predators, overuse of fire to maintain grassland ecosystems may lead to excessive oxidation, loss of carbon, and desertification in susceptible climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961894493|title=Holistic management : a commonsense revolution to restore our environment|last1=Savory|first1=Allan|last2=Butterfield|first2=Jody|isbn=9781610917438|edition=Third|location=Washington|oclc=961894493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South African savanna====
In the [[savanna]] of [[South Africa]], recently burned areas have new growth that provides palatable and nutritious forage compared to older, tougher grasses. This new forage attracts large [[herbivores]] from areas of unburned and grazed grassland that has been kept short by constant grazing. On these unburned "lawns", only those plant species adapted to heavy grazing are able to persist; but the distraction provided by the newly burned areas allows grazing-intolerant grasses to grow back into the lawns that have been temporarily abandoned, so allowing these species to persist within that ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Archibald2005"&gt;Archibald et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longleaf pine savannas===
[[image:Sarracenia Flava JPG01.jpg|thumb|100px|Yellow pitcher plant is dependent upon recurring fire in coastal plain savannas and flatwoods.]]
Much of the southeastern United States was once open [[longleaf pine]] forest with a rich understory of grasses, sedges, carnivorous plants and orchids. The above maps shows that these ecosystems (coded as pale blue) had the highest fire frequency of any habitat, once per decade or less. Without fire, deciduous forest trees invade, and their shade eliminates both the pines and the understory.  Some of the typical plants associated with fire include [[Sarracenia flava|Yellow Pitcher Plant]] and [[Pogonia ophioglossoides|Rose pogonia]]. The abundance and diversity of such plants is closely related to fire frequency. Rare animals such as [[gopher tortoise]]s and [[indigo snake]]s also depend upon these open grasslands and [[flatwoods]].&lt;ref&gt;Means, D. Bruce. 2006. Vertebrate faunal diversity in longleaf pine savannas.  Pages 155-213 in S. Jose, E. Jokela and D. Miller (eds.) Longleaf Pine Ecosystems: Ecology, Management and Restoration.  Springer, New York. xii + 438 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the restoration of fire is a priority to maintain species composition and biological diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Peet, R. K. and Allard, D. J. (1993).

Hermann, pp. 45–81. Tallahassee, FL: Tall Timbers Research Station.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire in wetlands===
Although it may seem strange, many kinds of wetlands are also influenced by fire. This usually occurs during periods of drought.  In landscapes with peat soils, such as bogs, the peat substrate itself may burn, leaving holes that refill with water as new ponds. Fires that are less intense will remove accumulated litter and allow other wetland plants to regenerate from buried seeds, or from rhizomes.  Wetlands that are influenced by fire include [[coastal marsh]]es, wet prairies, [[peat bog]]s, [[floodplain]]s, prairie marshes and [[flatwoods]].&lt;ref name="Keddy 2010"&gt;Keddy 2010, p. 114-120.&lt;/ref&gt; Since wetlands can store large amounts of carbon in peat, the fire frequency of vast northern peatlands is linked to processes controlling the carbon dioxide levels of the atmosphere, and to the phenomenon of global warming.&lt;ref name="Vitt  2010"&gt;Vitt et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire suppression==
{{Main|Wildfire suppression}}
Fire serves many important functions within fire-adapted ecosystems. Fire plays an important role in nutrient cycling, diversity maintenance and habitat structure. The suppression of fire can lead to unforeseen changes in ecosystems that often adversely affect the plants, animals and humans that depend upon that habitat. Wildfires that deviate from a historical fire regime because of fire suppression are called "uncharacteristic fires".

===Chaparral communities===
In 2003, southern [[California]] witnessed powerful [[chaparral]] wildfires. Hundreds of homes and hundreds of thousands of acres of land went up in flames. Extreme fire weather (low humidity, low fuel moisture and high winds) and the accumulation of dead plant material from 8 years of drought, contributed to a catastrophic outcome. Although some have maintained that fire suppression contributed to an unnatural buildup of fuel loads,&lt;ref name="Minnich1983"&gt;Minnich 1983&lt;/ref&gt; a detailed analysis of historical fire data has showed that this may not have been the case.&lt;ref name="Keeley1999"&gt;Keeley ''et al.'' 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Fire suppression activities had failed to exclude fire from the southern California chaparral. Research showing differences in fire size and frequency between southern California and Baja has been used to imply that the larger fires north of the border are the result of fire suppression, but this opinion has been challenged by numerous investigators and is no longer supported by the majority of fire ecologists.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

One consequence of the fires in 2003 has been the increased density of [[invasive species|invasive]] and [[introduced species|non-native]] plant species that have quickly colonized burned areas, especially those that had already been burned in the previous 15 years. Because shrubs in these communities are adapted to a particular historical fire regime, altered fire regimes may change the [[selective pressure]]s on plants and favor invasive and non-native species that are better able to exploit the novel post-fire conditions.&lt;ref name="Keeley2005"&gt;Keeley ''et al.'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish impacts===
The [[Boise National Forest]] is a US national forest located north and east of the city of [[Boise, Idaho]]. Following several uncharacteristically large wildfires, an immediately negative impact on fish populations was observed, posing particular danger to small and isolated fish populations.&lt;ref name="Burton2005"&gt;Burton (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In the long term, however, fire appears to rejuvenate fish habitats by causing [[hydraulic]] changes that increase flooding and lead to [[silt]] removal and the deposition of a favorable habitat substrate. This leads to larger post-fire populations of the fish that are able to recolonize these improved areas.&lt;ref name="Burton2005" /&gt; But although fire generally appears favorable for fish populations in these ecosystems, the more intense effects of uncharacteristic wildfires, in combination with the fragmentation of populations by human barriers to dispersal such as weirs and dams, ''will'' pose a threat to fish populations.

==Fire as a management tool==
[[Restoration ecology]] is the name given to an attempt to reverse or mitigate some of the changes that humans have caused to an ecosystem. [[Controlled burn]]ing is one tool that is currently receiving considerable attention as a means of restoration and management. Applying fire to an ecosystem may create habitats for species that have been negatively impacted by fire suppression, or fire may be used as a way of controlling invasive species without resorting to herbicides or pesticides. However, there is debate as to what state managers should aim to restore their ecosystems to, especially as to whether "natural" means pre-human or pre-European. [[Native American use of fire]], not natural fires, historically maintained the diversity of the [[Pre-Columbian savannas of North America|savannas of North America]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/heritage/docum/Fire/Bibliography%20-%20Indian%20Use%20of%20Fire.pdf|title=REFERENCES ON THE AMERICAN INDIAN USE OF FIRE IN ECOSYSTEMS|last=Williams|first=Gerald W.|date=2003-06-12|accessdate=2008-07-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706160607/http://www.blm.gov/heritage/docum/Fire/Bibliography%20-%20Indian%20Use%20of%20Fire.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When, how, and where managers should use fire as a management tool is a subject of debate.

===The Great Plains shortgrass prairie===
{{details|Shortgrass prairie}}
A combination of heavy livestock grazing and fire-suppression has drastically altered the structure, composition, and diversity of the shortgrass prairie ecosystem on the [[Great Plains]], allowing woody species to dominate many areas and promoting fire-intolerant invasive species. In semi-arid ecosystems where the decomposition of woody material is slow, fire is crucial for returning nutrients to the soil and allowing the grasslands to maintain their high productivity.

Although fire can occur during the growing or the dormant seasons, managed fire during the dormant season is most effective at increasing the grass and [[forb]] cover, [[biodiversity]] and plant nutrient uptake in shortgrass prairies.&lt;ref name="Brockwayet"&gt;Brockway et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Managers must also take into account, however, how invasive and non-native species respond to fire if they want to restore the integrity of a native ecosystem. For example, fire can only control the invasive [[spotted knapweed]] (''Centaurea maculosa'') on the Michigan tallgrass prairie in the summer, because this is the time in the knapweed's life cycle that is most important to its reproductive growth.&lt;ref&gt;Emery and Gross (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed conifer forests in the US Sierra Nevada===
Mixed [[conifer]] forests in the United States [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] used to have fire return intervals that ranged from 5 years up to 300 years, depending on the local climate. Lower elevations had more frequent fire return intervals, whilst higher and wetter elevations saw much longer intervals between fires. Native Americans tended to set fires during fall and winter, and land at a higher elevation was generally occupied by Native Americans only during the summer.&lt;ref name="Anderson1996"&gt;{{Cite book|last=ANDERSON|first=M.

=== Finnish boreal forests ===
The decline of habitat area and quality has caused many species populations to be red-listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to a study on forest management of Finnish boreal forests, improving the habitat quality of areas outside reserves can help in conservation efforts of endangered deadwood-dependent beetles. These beetles and various types of fungi both need dead trees in order to survive. Old growth forests can provide this particular habitat. However, most Fennoscandian boreal forested areas are used for timber and therefore are unprotected. The use of controlled burning and tree retention of a forested area with deadwood was studied and its effect on the endangered beetles. The study found that after the first year of management the number of species increased in abundance and richness compared to pre-fire treatment. The abundance of beetles continued to increase the following year in sites where tree retention was high and deadwood was abundant. The correlation between forest fire management and increased beetle populations shows a key to conserving these red-listed species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyvarinen|first1=Esko|last2=Kouki|first2=Jari|last3=Martikainen|first3=Petri|title=Fire and Green-Tree Retention in Conservation of Red-Listed and Rare Deadwood-Dependent Beetles in Finnish Boreal Forests|journal=Conservation Biology|date=1 February 2006|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1711–1719|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00511.x|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=aee65b99-0f41-4054-a741-ff200aca6310%40sessionmgr105&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=110|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian eucalypt forests===
Much of the old growth eucalypt forest in Australia is designated for conservation. Management of these forests is important because species like ''Eucalyptus grandis'' rely on fire to survive. There are a few eucalypt species that do not have a [[lignotuber]], a root swelling structure that contains buds where new shoots can then sprout. During a fire a lignotuber is helpful in the reestablishment of the plant. Because some eucalypts do not have this particular mechanism, forest fire management can be helpful by creating rich soil, killing competitors, and allowing seeds to be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tng|first1=David Y. P.|last2=Goosem|first2=Steve|last3=Jordan|first3=Greg J.|last4=Bowman|first4=David M.J.S.|title=Letting giants be - rethinking active fire management of old-growth eucalypt forest in the Australian tropics|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|date=2014|volume=51|pages=555–559|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12233|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2f35e2f6-ed9f-4aa9-9846-8e72e1870104%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=110|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management policies==

===United States===
Fire [[policy]] in the United States involves the federal government, individual state governments, tribal governments, interest groups, and the general public. The new federal outlook on fire policy parallels advances in ecology and is moving towards the view that many ecosystems depend on disturbance for their diversity and for the proper maintenance of their natural processes. Although human safety is still the number one priority in fire management, new US government objectives include a long-term view of ecosystems. The newest policy allows managers to gauge the relative values of private property and resources in particular situations and to set their priorities accordingly.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"/&gt;

One of the primary goals in fire management is to improve public education in order to suppress the "[[Smokey Bear]]" fire-suppression mentality and introduce the public to the benefits of regular natural fires.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8602">'''Formative contexts''' are the institutional and imaginative arrangements that shape a society's conflicts and resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Trubek, David M. 1990. "Programmatic Thought and the Critique of the Social Disciplines." In Critique and Construction, ed. M Perry. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; They are the [[Social structure|structures]] that limit both the practice and the imaginative possibilities in a socio-political order, and in doing so shape the routines of conflict over social, political and economic resources that govern access to labor, loyalty, and social station, e.g. government power, economic capital, technological expertise, etc. In a formative context, the institutions structure conflict over government power and capital allocation, whereas the imaginative framework shapes the preconceptions about possible forms of human interaction. Through this, a formative context further creates and sustains a set of roles and ranks, which mold conflict over the mastery of resources and the shaping of the ideas of social possibilities, identities and interests. The formative context of the [[liberal democracy|Western democracies]], for example, include the organization of production through managers and laborers, a set of laws administering capital, a state in relation to the citizen, and a social division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=False Necessity|year=2001|publisher=Verso|location=New York|pages=58–59, 69–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Also referred to as order, framework, or structure of social life, the concept of formative context was developed by philosopher and social theorist [[Roberto Unger]]. Whereas other social and political philosophers have taken the historical context as a given, and seen one existing set of institutional arrangements as necessarily giving birth to another set, Unger rejects this naturalization of the world and moves to explain how such contexts are made and reproduced. The most forceful articulation and development of the concept is in Unger's book ''False Necessity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=False Necessity|year=2001|publisher=Verso|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The thesis of formative context is central to Unger's theory of [[false necessity]], which rejects the idea of a closed number of institutional arrangements of human societies, e.g. feudalism and capitalism, and that these arrangements are the product of historical necessity, as theories of [[liberalism]] or [[Marxism]] claim. Rather, Unger argues that there are myriad institutional arrangements that can coalesce, and that they do so through a contingent process of struggle, reconciliation, and innovation among individuals and groups. For Unger, the concept of formative context serves to explain the basis of a certain set of institutional arrangements and their reliance upon each other. It offers an explanation of the cycles of reform and retrenchment of a socio-economic political system and how it remains undisturbed by rivalries and animosities. The theory of false necessity goes on to explain the connections of a formative context, their making and remaking, and how they maintain stability despite the contingent formation.&lt;ref&gt;For good overviews of Unger's thought see Collins, Hugh. “Roberto Unger and the Critical Legal Studies Movement,” Journal of Law and Society 14 (1987), Trubek, David M. "Radical Theory and Programmatic Thought." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 95, no. 2 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
While a formative context of a society exerts a major influence on the course of [[social actions]] and behaviors, it is itself hard to challenge, revise, or even identify in the midst of everyday conflicts and routines. Thus there are two criteria for determining if an institution or structure belongs in a formative context, one subjective and one objective. The '''subjective criteria''' considers the perspective of the social actors themselves and the arrangements that are assumed in their speech and actions. For example, the attempts of big business and labor to protect themselves through deals with each other, and the political efforts of unorganized labor and petty bourgeoisie to undermine and circumvent these deals by pressuring the government, operate on the same institutional assumption of the distinction between economy and polity, and that victory in one can be offset by the other. The '''objective criteria''' is simply that if a substitution of the proposed structure affects the hierarchies or cyclical conflicts—if it alters the social divisions—then it can be included in the formative context. For example, a change in any one of the following conditions would completely change the formative context of a Western democratic state: if the state stopped being democratic or was democratic enough to allow collective militancy and subject private centers of power to public accountability; if business could have its way and override all regulatory controls of govt; or if no workers could unionize or all of them could and did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = Social Theory, Its Situation and Its Task | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1987 | page=63| isbn = 978-0-521-32974-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=61–66| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western democracies==
The formative context of the North Atlantic democracies can be organized into four clusters of institutional arrangements: work, law, government, and occupational structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unger | first = Roberto | title = False Necessity: Anti-Necessitarian Social Theory in the Service of Radical Democracy, Revised Edition | publisher = Verso | location = London | year = 2004 |pages=69–82| isbn = 978-1-85984-331-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The '''work-organization complex''' makes a distinction in work between task definers and task executers, with the material rewards concentrated in the task defining jobs.
*The '''private-rights complex''' understands the rights of the individual vis-a-vis other individuals and the state. This structure is central to the allocation and control of capital, ensuring all forms of capital distribution and entitlement.
*The '''government-organization complex''' is the institutional arrangement to protect the individual from the state, and to prevent those in power from changing the formative context. It establishes a link between safeguards of freedom and the dispersion of powers, e.g. partisan rivalries fail to extend to debates over the fundamental institutions that affect social interactions.
*The '''occupational-structure complex''' is a social division of labor characterized by a lack of caste or religious division. It is based on material reward and task defining jobs receiving the highest pay.

==Influences in other fields==
The thesis of formative contexts has been heavily drawn on and used within the [[Social Study of Information Systems]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In the field of [[Information systems]] [[Claudio Ciborra]] and Giovan Lanzara define the term "formative context" as the "set of institutional arrangements and cognitive imageries that inform actors' practical and reasoning routines in organisations". They posit that the common inability to inquire into, challenge or shape formative context can inhibit individuals and organizations from acting competently and learning what they need to know in order to make the most of situations and technological transitions as the enchaining effect of Formative Context can lead to cognitive and social inertia.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

'''Gastrulation''' is a phase early in the [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]] of most [[animals]], during which the single-layered [[blastula]] is reorganized into a multilayered structure known as the '''gastrula'''. Before gastrulation, the embryo is a continuous [[Epithelium|epithelial]] sheet of cells; by the end of gastrulation, the embryo has begun [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] to establish distinct cell lineages, set up the basic axes of the body (e.g. [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal-ventral]], [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|anterior-posterior]]), and internalized one or more cell types including the prospective gut.

In [[Triploblasty|triploblastic]] organisms the gastrula is trilaminar ("three-layered"). These three ''[[germ layers]]'' are known as the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[endoderm]].&lt;ref name=mundlos2009&gt;Mundlos 2009: [https://books.google.com/books?id=FlfPSpBvKLgC&amp;pg=PA422 p. 422]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgeady-2004-p.34"&gt;McGeady, 2004: p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Diploblasty|diploblastic]] organisms, such as [[Cnidaria]] and [[Ctenophora]], the gastrula has only ectoderm and endoderm. The two layers are also sometimes referred to as the hypoblast and epiblast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essential Developmental Biology|last=Jonathon M.W.|first=Slack|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2013|isbn=978-0-470-92351-1|location=West Sussex, UK|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gastrulation takes place after [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] and the formation of the [[blastula]]. Gastrulation is followed by [[organogenesis]], when individual organs develop within the newly formed germ layers.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 1998: [https://books.google.com/books?id=JhSwumfgTQ4C&amp;pg=PA132 pp. 132-134]&lt;/ref&gt; Each layer gives rise to specific [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] in the developing embryo. The '''ectoderm''' gives rise to [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]], the [[nervous system]], and to the [[neural crest]] in vertebrates. The '''endoderm''' gives rise to the [[epithelium]] of the [[digestive system]] and [[respiratory system]], and organs associated with the [[digestive system]], such as the [[liver]] and [[pancreas]]. The '''mesoderm'''  gives rise to many cell types such as [[muscle]], [[bone]], and [[connective tissue]]. In vertebrates, mesoderm derivatives include the [[notochord]], the [[heart]],  [[blood]] and [[blood vessels]], the [[cartilage]] of the [[ribs]] and [[vertebrae]], and the [[dermis]].&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;Arnold &amp; Robinson, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Following gastrulation, cells in the body are either organized into sheets of connected cells (as in [[epithelia]]), or as a mesh of isolated cells, such as [[mesenchyme]].&lt;ref name="mcgeady-2004-p.34" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 1998: [https://books.google.com/books?id=JhSwumfgTQ4C&amp;pg=PA177 p. 177]&lt;/ref&gt;

The molecular mechanism and timing of gastrulation is different in different organisms. However, some common features of gastrulation across [[Triploblasty|triploblastic]] organisms include: (1) A change in the [[topological structure]] of the embryo, from a [[simply connected space|simply connected]] surface ([[sphere]]-like), to a non-simply connected surface ([[torus]]-like); (2) the [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]] of cells into one of three types (endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal); and (3) the [[digestion|digestive]] function of a large number of endodermal cells.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison 2011: [https://books.google.com/books?id=-IPG-vg7Pr8C&amp;pg=PA206 p. 206]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lewis Wolpert]], pioneering developmental biologist in the field, has been credited for noting that "It is not birth, marriage, or death, but gastrulation which is truly the most important time in your life."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Wolpert|Wolpert L]] (2008) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=VfdFOKz3O5UC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22The+triumph+of+the+embryo%22+%22It+is+not+birth,+marriage,+or+death,+but+gastrulation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRheHC9IXVAhWJWLwKHawvC_oQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20triumph%20of%20the%20embryo%22%20%22It%20is%20not%20birth%2C%20marriage%2C%20or%20death%2C%20but%20gastrulation%22&amp;f=false ''The triumph of the embryo'']. Courier Corporation, page 12. {{ISBN|9780486469294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "gastrula" and "gastrulation" were coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]], in his 1872 work ''"Biology of Calcareous Sponges"''.&lt;ref&gt;Ereskovsky 2010: [https://books.google.com/books?id=PHztG3LEUnsC&amp;pg=PA236 p. 236]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although gastrulation patterns exhibit enormous variation throughout the animal kingdom, they are unified by the [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9992/figure/A1689/?report=objectonly five basic types of cell movements]&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert 2010: p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; that occur during gastrulation: 1) [[invagination]] 2) [[Involution (medicine)|involution]] 3) [[Ingression (biology)|ingression]] 4) [[Embryogenesis#Formation of the gastrula|delamination]] 5) [[epiboly]].

==Classic model systems for understanding gastrulation==

Gastrulation is highly variable across the animal kingdom but has underlying similarities. Gastrulation has been studied in many animals, but some models have been used for longer than others. Furthermore, it is easier to study development in animals that develop outside the mother. Animals whose gastrulation is understood in the greatest detail include:
*[[Mollusc]]
*[[Sea urchin]]
*[[Frog]]
*[[Chicken]]

==Protostomes versus deuterostomes==

The [[Embryological origins of the mouth and anus|distinction between]] [[protostome]]s and [[deuterostome]]s is based on the direction in which the mouth (stoma) develops in relation to the blastopore. Protostome derives from the Greek word protostoma meaning "first mouth"(πρώτος + στόμα) whereas Deuterostome's etymology is "second mouth" from the words second and mouth (δεύτερος + στόμα).

The major distinctions between deuterostomes and protostomes are found in embryonic development:

* Mouth/anus
** In protostome development, the first opening in development, the blastopore, becomes the animal's [[mouth]].
** In deuterostome development, the blastopore becomes the animal's [[anus]].
* [[Cleavage (embryo)|Cleavage]]
** Protostomes have what is known as ''spiral cleavage'' which is ''determinate'', meaning that the fate of the cells is determined as they are formed.
** Deuterostomes have what is known as ''radial cleavage'' that is ''indeterminate''.

==Sea urchins==
Sea urchins [[Euechinoidea]] have been an important model system in developmental biology since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Laubichler, M.D. and Davidson, E. H. (2008). "Boveri's long experiment: sea urchin merogones and the establishment of the role of nuclear chromosomes in development". "Developmental Biology". "314(1):1-11". "doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.11.024".&lt;/ref&gt; Their gastrulation is often considered the archetype for invertebrate deuterostomes.&lt;ref name="gast-urchin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McClay |first1=David R.|last2=Gross |first2=J.M. |last3=Range|first3=Ryan |last4=Peterson |first4=R.E. |last5=Bradham |first5=Cynthia |editor-last=Stern |editor-first=Claudio D. |title=Gastrulation: From Cells to Embryos |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press |date=2004 |pages=123–137|chapter=Chapter 9: Sea Urchin Gastrulation |isbn=0-87969-707-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germ layer determination===
Sea urchins exhibit highly stereotyped cleavage patterns and cell fates. Maternally deposited [[mRNA]]s establish the organizing center of the sea urchin embryo. Canonical [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt]] and [[Notch signaling pathway|Delta-Notch]] signaling progressively segregate progressive endoderm and mesoderm.&lt;ref&gt;McClay, D. R. 2009. Cleavage and Gastrulation in Sea Urchin. eLS. {{DOI|10.1002/9780470015902.a0001073.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell internalization===
In [[Euechinoids]] the first cells to internalize are the primary [[mesenchyme]] cells (PMCs), which have a [[Sea urchin skeletogenesis|skeletogenic]] fate, which ingress during the blastula stage. Gastrulation – internalization of the prospective [[endoderm]] and non-skeletogenic [[mesoderm]] – begins shortly thereafter with invagination and other cell rearrangements the vegetal pole, which contribute approximately 30% to the final [[archenteron]] length. The [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9987/figure/A1730/?report=objectonly gut's final length] depends on cell rearrangements within the archenteron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hardin J D | year = 1990 | title = Context-sensitive cell behaviors during gastrulation. | url = http://worms.zoology.wisc.edu/reprints/hardin_sem_DB_1990.pdf | journal = Semin. Dev. Biol. | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 335–345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amphibians==

Tailless amphibians ([[Frog|Anura]]) are a classic model system for gastrulation.

===Symmetry breaking===
The sperm contributes one of the two [[Spindle apparatus|mitotic asters]] needed to complete first cleavage. The sperm can enter anywhere in the animal half of the egg but its exact point of entry will break the egg's radial symmetry by organizing the [[cytoskeleton]]. Prior to first cleavage, the egg's cortex rotates relative to the internal [[cytoplasm]] by the coordinated action of [[microtubules]], in a process known as cortical rotation. This displacement brings maternally loaded determinants of cell fate from the equatorial cytoplasm and vegetal cortex into contact, and together these determinants set up the [[Primitive knot|organizer]]. Thus, the area on the vegetal side opposite the sperm entry point will become the organizer.&lt;ref name = "Gilbert-AmpAxis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Scott F. |title=Developmental Biology |publisher=Sinauer Associates |date=2000|chapter=Axis Formation in Amphibians: The Phenomenon of the Organizer, The Progressive Determination of the Amphibian Axes|chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10101/#A2296}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilde Mangold]], working in the lab of [[Hans Spemann]], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10101/figure/A2302/?report=objectonly demonstrated] that this special "organizer" of the embryo is necessary and sufficient to induce gastrulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Spemann H., Mangold H. | year = 1924 | title = Über Induktion von Embryonanlagen durch Implantation artfremder Organisatoren | url = | journal = Roux' Arch. f.

===Germ layer determination===
Specification of endoderm depends on rearrangement of maternally deposited determinants, leading to nuclearization of [[Beta-catenin]]. Mesoderm is [[Cellular differentiation|induced]] by signaling from the presumptive endoderm to cells that would otherwise become ectoderm.&lt;ref name="Gilbert-AmpAxis"/&gt;

===Cell internalization===
The [[dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] lip of the blastopore is the mechanical driver of gastrulation. The first sign of invagination seen in [http://www.gastrulation.org/Movie13_1.mov this video of frog gastrulation] is the dorsal lip.

==Amniotes==

===Overview===
In [[amniote]]s (reptiles, birds and mammals), gastrulation involves the creation of the '''blastopore''', an opening into the [[archenteron]].  Note that the blastopore is not an opening into the [[blastocoel]], the space within the [[blastula]], but represents a new inpocketing that pushes the existing surfaces of the blastula together.  In [[amniotes]], gastrulation occurs in the following sequence: (1) the [[embryo]] becomes [[asymmetry|asymmetric]]; (2) the [[primitive streak]] forms; (3) cells from the [[epiblast]] at the [[primitive streak]] undergo an [[Epithelial-mesenchymal transition|epithelial to mesenchymal transition]] and [[ingression (biology)|ingress]] at the [[primitive streak]] to form the [[germ layers]].&lt;ref name=Arnold /&gt;

===Symmetry breaking===
In preparation for gastrulation, the embryo must become asymmetric along both the [[Proximo-distal|proximal-distal axis]] and the [[Anteroposterior|anterior-posterior axis]].  The proximal-distal axis is formed when the cells of the embryo form the “egg cylinder,” which consists of the extraembryonic tissues, which give rise to structures like the [[placenta]], at the proximal end and the [[epiblast]] at the distal end.  Many signaling pathways contribute to this reorganization, including [[bone morphogenetic protein|BMP]], [[fibroblast growth factor|FGF]], [[nodal signaling|nodal]], and [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt]].  Visceral endoderm surrounds the [[epiblast]].  The [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] visceral endoderm (DVE) migrates to the [[anterior]] portion of the embryo, forming the “anterior visceral endoderm” (AVE).  This breaks anterior-posterior symmetry and is regulated by [[NODAL|nodal]] signaling.&lt;ref name=Arnold /&gt;

===Germ layer determination===
The [[primitive streak]] is formed at the beginning of gastrulation and is found at the junction between the extraembryonic tissue and the [[epiblast]] on the posterior side of the embryo and the site of [[ingression (biology)|ingression]].&lt;ref name=Tam&gt;Tam &amp; Behringer, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Formation of the [[primitive streak]] is reliant upon [[NODAL|nodal]] signaling&lt;ref name=Arnold /&gt; in the [[Koller's sickle]] within the cells contributing to the primitive streak and [[BMP4]] signaling from the extraembryonic tissue.&lt;ref name=Tam /&gt;&lt;ref name=catala2005&gt;Catala, 2005: [https://books.google.com/books?id=RJvkR3gfExwC&amp;pg=PA1535 p. 1535]&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, [[Cerberus (protein)|Cer1]] and [[Lefty (protein)|Lefty1]] restrict the primitive streak to the appropriate location by antagonizing [[NODAL|nodal]] signaling.&lt;ref name=Loebel&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tam, P.P.  |author2=Loebel, D.A|title=Gene function in mouse embryogenesis: get set for gastrulation | journal = Nat Rev Genet | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 368–81 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17387317 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2084}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The region defined as the [[primitive streak]] continues to grow towards the distal tip.&lt;ref name=Arnold /&gt;

During the early stages of development, the primitive streak is the structure that will establish [[bilateral symmetry]], determine the site of gastrulation and initiate germ layer formation. To form the streak, reptiles, birds and mammals arrange mesenchymal cells along the prospective midline, establishing the first embryonic axis, as well as the place where cells will ingress and migrate during  the process of gastrulation and germ layer formation.&lt;ref name="mikawa"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1002/dvdy.10458 |vauthors=Mikawa T, Poh AM, Kelly KA, Ishii Y, Reese DE |title= Induction and patterning of the primitive streak, an organizing center of gastrulation in the amniote. |journal= Dev Dyn |volume=229 |pages= 422–32|year=2004 |pmid=14991697| issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primitive streak extends through this midline and creates the antero-posterior body axis,&lt;ref name="downs"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1002/bies.200900038 |author= Downs KM. |title= The enigmatic primitive streak: prevailing notions and challenges concerning the body axis of mammals. |journal= BioEssays |volume=31 |pages= 892–902|year=2009|pmid=19609969| issue=8 |pmc= 2949267}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first symmetry-breaking event in the [[embryo]], and marks the beginning of gastrulation.&lt;ref name="chuai"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chuai M, Zeng W, Yang X, Boychenko V, Glazier JA, Weijer CJ |title= Cell movement during chick primitive streak formation. |journal= Dev.

In order for the cells to move from the [[epithelium]] of the [[epiblast]] through the [[primitive streak]] to form a new layer, the cells must undergo an [[Epithelial-mesenchymal transition|epithelial to mesenchymal transition]] (EMT) to lose their epithelial characteristics, such as [[Cell adhesion|cell-cell adhesion]].  [[fibroblast growth factor|FGF]] signaling is necessary for proper EMT.  [[FGFR1]] is needed for the up regulation of [[SNAI1]], which down regulates [[CDH1 (gene)|E-cadherin]], causing a loss of cell adhesion.  Following the EMT, the cells [[ingression (biology)|ingress]] through the [[primitive streak]] and spread out to form a new layer of cells or join existing layers.  [[FGF8]] is implicated in the process of this dispersal from the [[primitive streak]].&lt;ref name=Loebel /&gt;

== Gastrulation ''in vitro'' ==
There have been a number of attempts to understand the processes of Gastrulation using ''in vitro'' techniques in parallel and complementary to studies in embryos, usually though the use of [[Cell culture|2D]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=David A.|last2=Rué|first2=Pau|last3=Mackenzie|first3=Jonathan P.|last4=Davies|first4=Eleanor|last5=Martinez Arias|first5=Alfonso|date=2014-01-01|title=Brachyury cooperates with Wnt/β-catenin signalling to elicit primitive-streak-like behaviour in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12915-014-0063-7|journal=BMC Biology|volume=12|pages=63|doi=10.1186/s12915-014-0063-7|issn=1741-7007|pmc=4171571|pmid=25115237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warmflash|first=Aryeh|last2=Sorre|first2=Benoit|last3=Etoc|first3=Fred|last4=Siggia|first4=Eric D|last5=Brivanlou|first5=Ali H|title=A method to recapitulate early embryonic spatial patterning in human embryonic stem cells|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nmeth.3016|journal=Nature Methods|volume=11|issue=8|pages=847–854|doi=10.1038/nmeth.3016|pmc=4341966|pmid=24973948|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Etoc|first=Fred|last2=Metzger|first2=Jakob|last3=Ruzo|first3=Albert|last4=Kirst|first4=Christoph|last5=Yoney|first5=Anna|last6=Ozair|first6=M.

These are associated with number of clear advantages in using tissue-culture based protocols, some of which include reducing the cost of associated ''in vivo'' work (thereby reducing, replacing and refining the use of animals in experiments; [[The Three Rs (animals)|the 3Rs]]), being able to accurately apply agonists/antagonists in spatially and temporally specific manner&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; which may technically difficult to perform during Gastrulation. However, it is important to relate the observations in culture to the processes occurring in the embryo for context.

To illustrate this, the guided differentiation of mouse ESCs has resulted in generating [[primitive streak]]-like cells that display many of the characteristics of epiblast cells that traverse through the primitive streak&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (e.g. transient [[brachyury]] up regulation and the cellular changes associated with an [[Epithelial–mesenchymal transition|epithelial to mesenchymal transition]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;), and human ESCs cultured on micro patterns, treated with [[Bone morphogenetic protein 4|BMP4]], can generate spatial differentiation pattern similar to the arrangement of the [[germ layer]]s in the human embryo.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Finally, using 3D [[embryoid body]]- and [[organoid]]-based techniques, small aggregates of mouse ESCs ([[Gastruloid|Embryonic Organoids, or Gastruloids]]) are able to show a number of processes of early mammalian embryo development such as symmetry-breaking, polarisation of gene expression, gastrulation-like movements, axial elongation and the generation of all three embryonic axes (anteroposterior, dorsoventral and left-right axes).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=David A.|last2=Girgin|first2=Mehmet|last3=Alonso-Crisostomo|first3=Luz|last4=Trivedi|first4=Vikas|last5=Baillie-Johnson|first5=Peter|last6=Glodowski|first6=Cherise R.|last7=Hayward|first7=Penelope C.|last8=Collignon|first8=Jérôme|last9=Gustavsen|first9=Carsten|date=2017-11-01|title=Anteroposterior polarity and elongation in the absence of extra-embryonic tissues and of spatially localised signalling in gastruloids: mammalian embryonic organoids|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/144/21/3894|journal=Development|language=en|volume=144|issue=21|pages=3894–3906|doi=10.1242/dev.150391|issn=0950-1991|pmid=28951435|pmc=5702072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3965">In [[computational complexity theory]], an '''integer circuit''' is a [[circuit (computer science)|circuit]] [[model of computation]] in which inputs to the circuit are [[set (mathematics)|set]]s of [[integer]]s and each gate of the circuit computes either a set operation or an arithmetic operation on its input sets.

As an [[algorithm]]ic problem, the possible questions are to find if a given integer is an element of the output node or if two circuits compute the same set. The decidability is still an open question, but there are results on restriction of thoses circuits. Finding answers to some questions about this model could serve as a proof to many important mathematical conjectures, like [[Goldbach's conjecture]]. 

It is a natural extension of the [[circuits over sets of natural numbers]] when the considered set contains also negative integers, the definitions, which does not change, will not be repeated on this page. Only the differences will be mentioned.

== Complexity of the membership problem ==

The membership problem is the problem of deciding, given an integer circuit ''C'', an input to the circuit ''X'', and a specific integer ''n'', whether the integer ''n'' is in the output of the circuit ''C'' when provided with input ''X''. The computational complexity of this problem depends on the type of gates allowed in the circuit ''C''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''Kurkihar hoard''' represents a rare set of 226 bronzes, mostly Buddhist, dating to between the 9th and 12th centuries CE, which were found in  Kurkihar near [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] in the Indian state of [[Bihar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jais/hd_jais.htm Guy, The "Påala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture, Volume 10 of Studies in South Asian Culture,  The "Pala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture, Susan L. Huntington  Brill Archive, 1984, p. 141]&lt;/ref&gt; The village of Kurkihar is situated about 5&amp;nbsp;km. north-east of Wazirgunj, and 27 km east from [[Gaya, India|Gaya]]. The inscriptions found suggest that Kurkihar was once a well known international pilgrimage center.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bhaskar.com/news/BIH-PAT-HMU-buddhist-archaeological-site-kurkihar-5620721-PHO.html जिद धरोहर बचाने की : गया के कुर्किहार के घर-घर में है धरोहर, विदेशों से था संबंध,  Bhaskar News,  Jun 13, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==

Major Kittoe in 1847, he visited the place twice and on the second visit to the village, spent four days collecting "ten cart-loads of images; all Buddhist and the Tamrika period". A great portion of this collection is preserved in the Indian Museum Kolkata.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhpromo.org.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=71  KURKIHAR, -The remnants of an artistic age, 10 December 2009 20:10]&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham visited Kurkihar in 1861-62 and again in 1879-80. He mentions that the site was about 600 feet square and about 25 feet high. He mentioned having seen here not only numerous Buddhist images, large and small, but a large number of votive stupas. He says there were in his time "row after row of Chaityas extending north to south for several hundred feet".

In 1930 a hoard of 226 bronzes and five other objects was found at Kurkihar, which were unearthed from the main mound. These included  Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Stupas, Bells and ritual objects. Today, these objects are displayed in special room in the Patna Museum.

Of the 87 images, 81 were Buddhist and 6 Brahmanical. They were all found in one spot, with the smaller images enclosed in earthen jars.&lt;ref&gt;S.K. Sarasvati and K.C. Sarkar, Kurkihar, Gaya and Bodh-Gaya, Rajshahi, 1936, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; They were found about 25 feet below the surface of the main mound,  when someone was digging for bricks.

==Major images ==

The Sonnery Kurkihar Buddha was sold for US$ 2,806,390 on 3 Oct 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/24028/lot/16/  THE SONNERY KURKIHAR BUDDHA]&lt;/ref&gt; It is roughly contemporaneous with the Atisha period in Tibet (1st half of the 11th century), which initiated a two-century period when Indian bronzes were collected by Tibetans and served as the models of  their own early styles. The Sonnery Kurkihar Buddha may have been one such image that travelled to Tibet during the [[History_of_Tibet#Tibetan_Renaissance_.2810th-12th_century.29|Tibetan Renaissance]] period.

In 2005, for an exhibition in Australia, two of the three statues representing India were from Kurkihar, they were valued at US $30 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livehindustan.com/news/Gaya/article1-Kurkihar-neglected-Buddhist-site-lies-in-increased-prized-sculptures-653651.html  उपेक्षित है कुर्किहार बौद्ध स्थल, बढ़ में छिपी है बेशकीमती मूर्तियां, Live Hindustan, 4 जनवरी, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscriptions==
Cunningham has written: "I procured several short but interesting inscriptions at Kurkihar. The name of Sakala is mentioned in several of them, and also Kerala in Dakshinades. The age of these inscriptions, judging from the shapes of the letters, must be about A.D. 800 to 1000"&lt;ref&gt;[https://silentpagesindia.blogspot.in/2013/09/visit-to-kurkihar-in-august-2013.html   An ancient legendary site yet to be fully explored and understood, 28th September 2013, Vikas Vaibhav]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ninety three inscriptions have been found on the bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;Banerji-Sastri, "Ninety-three Inscriptions on the Kurkihar Bronzes,  Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, XXVI, 3 (1940), 236-251. &lt;/ref&gt; The Kurkihar inscriptions refer to Devapala (810–c. 850), Rajyapala (908–940), Mahipala (988–c. 1036) and Vigrahapala III (1054–1072), ranging from 9th century to 1074 AD.  The name of the monastery was apparently named Apanaka, which is mentioned in several inscriptions. The monastery was apparently very popular among the visitors from [[Kanchi]] in South India.

The names, places of origin and ranks of the donors for 9-12th century have been analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jocbs.org/index.php/jocbs/article/download/100/120 The socieo-economic dimensions of dedicatory inscriptions, B.N. Prasad, JOBS.2074(7):116-152]&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution is 9th century:14, 10th: 21, 11th: 25, and 12th: 10.

==Manuscript==
A circa 1100-1125 manuscript of [[Prajnaparamita#A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81_Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81|Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita]]  now in  [[LACM]].&lt;ref&gt;A Forgotten Monastery of Ancient Bihar, Pal, Pratapaditya, South Asian studies, Vol:4 No:1 Date: 1988 Pages:83-88&lt;/ref&gt; was copied in this monastery during the rule of [[Ramapala]].

==Significance==

Kurkihar was apparently a major pilgrimage center located midway between [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] and [[Rajgriha]] and as well an artistic center of brass and stone sculpting. The inscriptions found  refer to donors not only from distant place in India like Sakala in Punjab, and Kerala, Conjeevaram or Kanchi in the south, but also from Bali Islands, Malaya as well as  other countries. The inscriptions  refer to a number of kings, mostly of the Pala dynasty.

==Comparison with Nalanda bronzes==
[[File:043 Buddha Teaching, Nalanda (9218609395).jpg|thumb|Buddha Teaching, [[Nalanda]] ]]

Kurkihar bronzes have been compared with the bronzes from nearby Nalanda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qCQVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=nalanda+bronzes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZG8OgVa2md&amp;sig=v10TTanrXBuxy8Cs4mxUGYNck34&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix87zom6bXAhXH4IMKHULFDUoQ6AEISTAM#v=onepage&amp;q=kurkihar&amp;f=false The Bronzes of Nalanda and Hindu-javanese Art, A.J.

Huntington, Brill Archive, 1984  p. 5-153]&lt;/ref&gt; Kurkihar bronzes data from 10th to 12th cent while Nalanda bronzes cover the period from 7th to 9th cent. nalanda bronzes are reddish whereas Kurkihar bronzes are more yellow.

==Museums==

Most of the Kurkihar bronzes are in the [[Patna Museum]]. The Hindu temple situated in the north-eastern portion of the village was visited by Cunningham in 1861 where a number of images, both Buddhist and Hindu images,  dated to the 10th - 11th Century AD, have been preserved here.

==Patna Museum theft==

On Sept 26, 2006, 18 bronze images from Kurkihar were stolen from the Patna Museum. The thieves entered through a window by cutting the cutting bars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/18-statues-figurines-of-pala-period-stolen-from-patna-museum/418634   18 statues, figurines of Pala period stolen from Patna museum, Outlook, Sept 26, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The images were later recovered from a gang  including a Vinod Yadav in Nalanda district, and Shahid Warsi of Kolkata. A [[Manjushri]] image was not recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6038510.stm Priceless Indian statue recovered, BBC,  10 October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LIVAC''' is an uncommon language [[text corpus|corpus]] dynamically maintained since 1995. Different from other existing corpora, LIVAC has adopted a rigorous and regular as well as "Windows" approach in processing and filtering massive media texts from representative communities in the Pan-Chinese region including [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Taipei]], [[Singapore]], [[Shanghai]], [[Beijing]], [[Guangzhou]], and [[Shenzhen]].&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, Benjamin; Lai, Tom; Chan, Samuel; and Wang, William S.-Y. (Eds). (1998). ''Quantitative and Computational Studies on the Chinese Language'' 《漢語計量與計算研究》. Language Information Sciences Research Centre, City University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents are thus deliberately repetitive in most cases, represented by textual samples drawn from editorials, local and international news, cross-[[Taiwan Strait|Formosan Straits]] news, as well as news on finance, sports and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, B. K., Kwong, O.Y. (Eds). (2015). ''Linguistic Corpus and Corpus Linguistics in the Chinese Context'' ''(Journal of Chinese Linguistics Monograph Series Number 25)'', Hong Kong: [[Chinese University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, 2.5 billion characters of news media texts have been filtered so far, of which 600 million characters have been processed and analyzed and have yielded an expanding Pan-Chinese dictionary of 2 million words from the Pan-Chinese printed media. Through rigorous analysis based on computational methodology, LIVAC has at the same time accumulated a large amount of accurate and meaningful statistical data on the Chinese language and their speech communities in the Pan-Chinese region, and the result shows considerable and important variations.&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, Benjamin. (2004). "Chinese Language Processing at the Dawn of the 21st Century", in C R Huang and W Lenders (eds) ''Language and Linguistics Monograph Series B: Frontiers in Linguistics I'', pp.189–207. Institute of Linguistics, [[Academia Sinica]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, B. K. (2017). Loanwords in Mandarin Through Other Chinese Dialects. In R. Sybesma, W. Behr, Y. Gu, Z. Handel, C.-T. Huang &amp; J. Myers (Eds.), ''The Encyclopaedia of Chinese Language and Linguistics'' (Vol. 2, pp. 641-647). Leiden; Boston: BRILL&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Windows" approach is the most representative feature of LIVAC and has enabled Pan-Chinese media texts to be quantitatively analyzed according to various attributes such as ''locations'', ''time'' and ''subject'' domains. Thus, various types of comparative studies and applications in information technology as well as development of often related innovative applications have been possible.&lt;ref&gt;Tsou, Benjamin, and Kwong, Olivia. (2015). LIVAC as a Monitoring Corpus for Tracking Trends beyond Linguistics. In Tsou, Benjamin, and Kwong, Olivia.,  (eds.), ''Linguistic Corpus and Corpus Linguistics in the Chinese Context'' ''(Journal of Chinese Linguistics Monograph Series No.25)''.

In Chin, Chi-on Andy and Kwok, Bit-chee and Tsou, Benjamin K., (eds.), ''Commemorative Essays for Professor Yuen-Ren Chao: Father of Modern Chinese Linguistics''. Taiwan: Crane Publishing. pp. 343-357.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, LIVAC has allowed longitudinal developments to be taken into account, facilitating [[Key Word in Context]] (KWIC) and comprehensive study of target words and their underlying concepts as well as linguistic structures over the past 20 years, based on variables such as ''region'', ''duration'' and ''content''. Results from the extensive and accumulative data analysis contained in LIVAC have enabled the cultivation of textual databases of proper names, place names, organization names, new words, and bi-weekly and annual rosters of media figures. Related applications have included the establishment of verb and adjective databases, the formulation of sentiment indices, and related opinion mining, to measure and compare the popularity of global media figures in the Chinese media (LIVAC Annual Pan-Chinese Celebrity Rosters, later renamed as the Pan-Chinese Media Personalities Rosters)&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikisites.cityu.edu.hk/sites/newscentre/en/Pages/201512281400.aspx CityU releases 2015 LIVAC Pan-Chinese Media Personality Roster], [[City University of Hong Kong]], Hong Kong, 28 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikisites.cityu.edu.hk/sites/media/pr/Pages/2017010201.aspx CityU releases 2016 LIVAC Pan-Chinese Media Personality Roster], [[City University of Hong Kong]], Hong Kong, 02 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and construction of monthly new word lexicons (LIVAC Annual Pan-Chinese New Word Rosters).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikisites.cityu.edu.hk/sites/newscentre/en/Pages/201502121400.aspx CityU releases 2014 Pan-Chinese New Word Rosters], [[City University of Hong Kong]], Hong Kong, 12 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikisites.cityu.edu.hk/sites/newscentre/en/pages/201602041130.aspx CityU releases 2015 LIVAC Pan-Chinese New Word Rosters], [[City University of Hong Kong]], Hong Kong, 04 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, the analysis of the emergence, diffusion and transformation of new words, and the publication of dictionaries of [[neologism]]s have been made possible.&lt;ref&gt;鄒嘉彥、游汝杰（編）（2007），《21世紀華語新詞語詞典》（簡體字版），上海，復旦大學出版社。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;鄒嘉彥、游汝杰（編）（2010），《全球華語新詞語詞典》，北京，商務印書館。&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leadership analysis''' is the art of breaking down a leader into basic [[Psychology|psychological]] components for study and use by academics and practitioners. Good leadership analyses are not reductionist, but rather take into consideration the overall person in the context of the times, society, and culture from which they come. Leadership analysis is traditionally housed in [[political psychology]] departments and utilizes the tools of psychology to achieve political ends by exploiting the psyche in the case of practitioners, or to gain knowledge about the building blocks of leadership and individuals in the case of academics.&lt;ref name=USIC&gt;{{cite book|last=Richelson|first=Jeffrey T.|title=The US Intelligence Community|year=2012|publisher=Westview Press|location=United States|isbn=9780813345116|page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distinction between the two is not made frivolously; in fact, while academics and practitioners both engage in the overarching act of analyzing leaders, they go about it quite differently. Applied analysts make great use of the psychobiography, while academics tend to analyze transcriptions in search of [[trait theory|traits]] and character clues.&lt;ref name=Post&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=Jerrold|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|isbn=0472068385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applied analysis ==

In keeping with the goals of psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halonen|first=Jane|title=APA GUIDELINES FOR  THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/precollege/about/psymajor-guidelines.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (describe, explain, predict, control), a psychobiography is first a description of an individual’s life, an explanation or analysis in psychological terms of how the events shaped the individual, and an if/then predictor (if conducting an applied analysis) of the actions the individual might take if given the right situation, leaving the control/change up to the policy-maker requesting the analysis. An if/then predictor is used because no analyst will be able to know the environment that acts upon the individual to the extent of proper analysis. One of the most influential government analysts is [[Jerrold Post]], founder of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA’s]] [[Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior]]. Post's analytical paradigm is below. His background, like many of the earliest applied analysts, was in psychiatry, which utilizes qualitative methods for analysis.

Important theorists for a [[psychobiography]] would be [[Gordon Allport]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Albert Bandura]], [[John Bowlby]], among others.

These methods focus primarily [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]], [[personality]], and [[developmental psychology|developmental]] theories including the influence of role models, early experiences, heroes and mentors, as well as ego defenses (known more commonly as [[defence mechanisms]]), personality types, belief systems, information processing styles, and cognitive factors. The important thing to note about leadership analysis is the consistency of the individual’s belief systems, rather than small fluctuations.

[[Personality type]]s (and [[personality disorder]]s) play a large part in aiding with analysis, as they are often associated with specific cognitive beliefs and processes. For example, extreme narcissists lack [[empathy]], conscience, and will do anything to accomplish personal goals. Lack of accomplishment is usually taken extremely badly and narcissists have low self-esteem. Narcissists have trouble learning from others because they know everything. Leaders who are narcissists make their people give great shows affirming their righteous leadership, demand praise from others, and employ “yes men”, or sycophants.

Other common personality types of leaders are obsessive-compulsive, which makes for a hardworking leader with great organizational skills, but also one afraid to make decisions for fear of making a mistake, excessively contentious, and lacking in social grace, and the paranoid; a hypersensitive, easily slighted leader who see the world as full of enemies and will rarely negotiate. [[Paranoia|Paranoid]] leaders fall prey to projecting their beliefs (ego defense) on those around them and are therefore largely autonomous and independent. Their enemies are always coordinated and rational actors intent on the paranoid’s destruction.

In line with developmental psychology, life stages are a particularly important part of analysis, especially during the mid-thirties (when most leaders of coups emerge), or in old age, when leaders, especially narcissists, feel the reins of power slipping and either try to consolidate power, as did [[Deng Xiaoping]], or give it up, as did [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=Jerrold|title=Leaders and their Followers in a Dangerous World: the Psychology of Political Behavior|year=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic analysis ==
In contrast to applied analysts, academic analysts generally come from the fields of social psychology and political science and take a quantitative methodology when conducting analysis, usually consisting in part of [[trait theory]] (openness, contentiousness, extroversion, etc.) and/or character study (central to individual’s functioning, observable, stable patterns of behavior, present across circumstances). In addition, quantitative measures such as verbal styles, grammatical choices, and scales for achievement, affiliation, and power provide room for analysis.

=== Verbal categories ===
Sources that are analyzed for verbal styles are general public data that has been cross-checked, legitimized, and filtered for representation of the individual as much as possible. Verbal style is preferred to be off the cuff, both to ensure lack of third party input and to put the individual in what is deemed a stressful situation.

Verbal categories include [[qualifier]]s (“I believe”), retractors (“but”, “nevertheless”), I/We, me, [[Affirmative and negative|negatives]] (“nothing”, “never”, “not”), explainers (“because” “therefore”), feeling expressions (“I like”),  direct references (“your question”), nonpersonal references (“Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine”), and expressions. The scores are based on occurrences/1000 words.

These scores can tell about the traits of the individual. Many qualifiers suggest a lack of decisiveness, use of retractors indicate an individual who will reconsider, use of retractors and negatives indicates a large amount of impulsivity, a combination of using I, me, explainers, negatives, and qualifiers, suggest anxiousness (and a less likely change of being the leader of a country), moodiness is identified by high I/we ratio, direct references, expression of feelings, and adverbial intensifiers. Other traits include an angry disposition, evidenced by high negatives, rhetorical questions, and direct references. Impulsive speakers use negatives more than any other group, controlling speakers use low qualifiers, steer the conversation, and use very few feelings. Histrionic individuals use adverbial intensifiers and exaggeration. Passivity is categorized by the extensive use of me. Domineering individuals use lots of qualifiers, retractors, and explainers as well as interruptions. Familiar behavior (establish report) is not surprising evidenced by the use of first names and high direct references. A resilient speaker will lose their verbal style during a crisis and then afterward resume it.&lt;ref name=Weintraub&gt;{{cite book|last=Weintraub|first=Walter|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motivation assessments ===
Leadership analyses can also come in the form of [[motivation]] assessments, where achievement, affiliation, and power are deemed the three fundamental dimensions. Achievement motivation, the concern for excellence, is often manifested in the leader claiming to do “good” or “better”. High achievers delay gratification, have high but achievable expectations, and are innovative. These leaders are rational calculators pursuing self-interest. Affiliation motivation, the concern for close relations with others, is manifested by statements of togetherness and common pursuits. Affiliation leaders form ideological circles and rely on friends, rather than experts, when formulating decisions. They work harder with people who share their ideologies and are aggressive towards people who are different or new. Affiliate leaders will rebel against those they believe are being exploitive, and perceptions of friends and enemies is important. They may appear erratic and unstable and are not adept and working with or managing people they don’t know or like. Power motivation portrays the leader and the leader’s group as the mover and shaker of events. Power motives with a sense of self-control, responsibility, and altruism leads to successful managers who create high-morale atmospheres, are visible and well-known (and liked). Power motives without self-censorship are prone to fall victim to ingratiation and flattery and will take extreme risks with little thought to moral considerations. Unchecked power motives create impulsive behavior and combined with stress, leads to lower immune functions, vulnerability to cardiovascular problems, and infectious diseases.

Studies have shown that countries heading to war will increase power language while decreasing affiliation language. Country documents with high achievement scores generally have stronger economies with greater numbers of entrepreneurs and higher levels of economic development.&lt;ref name=Winter&gt;{{cite book|last=Winter|first=David G|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trait assessment ===
Seven other traits are used for assessing leadership style. The belief that one can influence or control what happens ([[locus of control]]), the need for power and influence, conceptual complexity (ability to differentiate between people and things in an environment), self-confidence, and motivations (problem solving/relationships), general distrust or suspicion, in-group bias. Scoring is done per mention per speech and compared with other leaders being studied. When the first trait, belief in influence, is scored high, these leaders generally get their way and have a way forward. Low scores indicate a belief in constraints, but also in consensus building and compromise. High scores in this trait but low in power motivation will not be able to manipulate as well and will not achieve all they want to do.

=== Conceptual complexity ===
Conceptual complexity and levels of self-confidence make up a self-other orientation, which analyses the level of openness the individual is to input from others. Higher complexity than self-confidence mean more likely to take input, showing a concern for others and are successful at seeing the whole picture and dealing with situations on a case-by-case basis. The reverse situation (higher self-confidence) shows a leader who view the world as they wish to perceive it and use coercion to ensure their views become their follower’s views. Low in both is an individual who mirrors the group that elected them and tends to exhibit narcissistic tendencies.

Self-confidence scores are judged on the use of the words, I, me, myself, and mine. Scores are calculated by average percentage over the course of several speeches. Again, high self-confidence forms a filter with which the individual creates their world-view, low self-confidence turns the individual into a mouth for a cause. Contextual complexity (degree of differentiation) forecasts leaders either seeing multiple paths through situations  (high) or absolutist terms (low).

=== Motivation assessment ===
The continuum of motivations spans from relationships (group maintenance) to problem solving. Coding is done through word choice, where words like accomplish(ment), achieve(ment), plan, position, proposal, recommend(ation),  and tactic signify problem solving and words like appreciation, amnesty, collaboration, disappoint(ment), forgive(ness), harm, liberation, and suffering indicate group maintenance. Scoring is done of one in proportion to the other.

Problem solvers view people as tools to solve problems, sacrificing unity, morale, and cohesion if necessary. Relationship builders will move only if morale is high and the group wants to go in that way.

General distrust and suspicion and in-group bias come from leader’s distrustful of the “other” and believe in the exceptionalism of their people/state. Cues of this trait include words and phrases like great, peace-loving, progressive, successful, prosperous, powerful, capable, made great advances, has boundless resources, firmly defend borders, decide our own fate. Scoring is based on average of percentages across transcripts. Distrust is coded with words like doubtful, uneasy about, misgivings (of the out-group). High leaders in this category see the us-them paradigm and the leader becomes the group (we). The world is a zero-sum game and there may be external enemies constantly needing confrontation.

The directed psychobiography in this case would only include categories of topics discussed in speeches, audience, events and tenure, and any significance in changes of speech patterns/traits.&lt;ref name=Hermann&gt;{{cite book|last=Hermann|first=Margaret G.|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operational coding ===
Another way to conduct a leadership analysis is through operational coding. Operational coding analysis is the study of political leaders that closely focus on set of political beliefs and their cultural context. There are ten questions that should be answered:

Philosophy
#What is the “essential” nature of political life? Is the political universe essentially one of harmony or conflict? What is the fundamental character of one’s political opponents?
#What are the prospects for the eventual realization of one’s fundamental values and aspirations? Can one be optimistic, or must one be pessimistic on this score; and in what respects the one and/or the other?
#Is the political future predictable? In what sense and to what extent?
#How much “control” or “mastery” can one have over historical development? What is one’s role in “moving” and “shaping” history in the desired direction?
#What is the role of “chance” in human affairs and in historical development?

Instrumental
#What is the best approach for selecting goals or objectives for political action?
#How are the goals of action pursued most effectively?
#How are the risks of political action calculated, controlled, and accepted?
#What is the best “timing” of action to advance one’s interests?
#What are the utility and role of different means for advancing one’s interests?

Answering these questions will give the nature of the belief system, which can then be categorized into six types (A-F) regarding the opinions of the nature of conflict. A, B, and C believe that conflict is temporary, caused by individual misperceptions (A), pathological societal institutions (B), or anarchical organizations of the international system (C). D, E, and F believe that conflict is permanent, caused by the individual (D), society (E), or the international system (F). Type A’s motivation is affiliation, which DEF are power motives. B and C shared achievement, but differed in power (B) and affiliation (C).

A system of analysis of operational coding is the psycholinguistic VICS (Verbs in Context System), a system for reviewing belief patterns in speeches in public statements and making inferences about behavior from those beliefs. Subject, verb category, domain of politics, tense of verb, intended target, and context are all scored with + or – points according to the table:

#	Identify the subject: Self or Other
#	Identify the tense of the transitive verb: past, present, future
:a.	Identify the category of the verb +/-
#	Words
:a.	Appeal, support (+1)		Oppose, resist (-1)
:b.	Promise benefits (+2)	Threaten costs (-2)
#	Deeds
:a.	Rewards (+3)			Punishments (-3)
#	Identify domain: Domestic or Foreign
#	Identify target and place in context

Scoring (after weighting based on same verb categories and multiplying by frequency measures)- these can be applied to any of the operational coding questions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker, Schafer, and Young|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Adolf Hitler ===
[[Adolf Hitler]] was one of the first targets of government analysis by the [[Office of Strategic Services]] on at least two occasions, one being by Dr. [[Henry Murray]] titled "[[Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler]]", another by [[Walter Charles Langer|Walter Langer]] titled [[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]], and another of unknown origin titled "Adolf Hitler". These psychobiographies included headers such as background, education, physique, religion, metamorphosis in Landsberg, sexual life, speechmaking technique, Hitler as he believes himself to be, Hitler as the German people know him, Hitler as his associates know him, Hitler as he knows himself, Hitler the man, and Predictions of Hitler's behavior in the coming future. These analyses included observations such as Hitler's messiah complex, sense of destiny, and how his rough beginnings inspired him to be where he is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Henry|title=Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler: With Predictions of His Future Behavior and Suggestions for Dealing with Him Now and After Germany's Surrender|url=http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/library/WhatWeHave/SpecialCollections/Donovan/Hitler/Download.cfm|work=Cornell University Law Library|publisher=Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Woodrow Wilson ===
[[Woodrow Wilson]] was another target of analysis by psychobiographers George and George, who concluded a self-defeating pattern of low self-esteem and inner doubt that originated from his father, a Presbyterian Preacher whose perfectionist demands his son internalized. A competing analysis by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] maintained that Wilson had not resolved the [[Oedipus complex]] and identified with his father and his harsh [[superego]]. His repressed aggression was reflected on those around him, who were his "younger brothers".

=== Camp David Profiles ===
Post's creation of the Center for the Analysis of Personality and Behavior (CAPB) (later the Political Psychology Division) at [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] lead to the creation of the Camp David Profiles, psychobiographies of [[Anwar Sadat]] and [[Menachem Begin]] as well as how to manipulate each to get the best negotiation position. These were extensively studied by Carter, and resulted in the Nobel Prize. Among the findings where Anwar Sadat's "Nobel Prize Complex", his desire to be forever known in history as a great leader and Begin's biblical preoccupation and fixation on detail, which Carter was able to play off each other.

=== Carter ===
From an academic perspective, Carter's VICS score changed intensely from before to after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Carter had previously been cooperative and friendly but changed to hostile and conflict prone afterward.

=== Bill Clinton ===
Bill Clinton's Trait and Motivation Profile, gathered from Q&amp;A at press conferences, presented [[Bill Clinton]] as a single successful politician, rather than a part of a larger whole or cause (use of "I" was highest of post-World War II presidents while "we" was lowest), the use of qualifiers and retractors, presented a confident individual with no desire to control the flow of conversation but who would make decisions and rethink them when necessary. He doesn't use many explainers and tells, rather than explains his views. He is the most expressive post-World War II president and with high adverbial intensifiers, he is an actor who displays histrionic ([[attention seeking]]) behavior. His high negatives score shows he's very defensive when attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weintraub|first=Walter|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan|location=Michigan|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saddam Hussein ===
An analysis of [[Saddam Hussein]] reveals a rational calculator who when necessary, finds it prudent to change mind and adapt other tactics, as long as he can find a face-saving measure to do so. His childhood started with his mother rejecting physically rejecting room, being saved by a [[Jews|Jewish]] family, and then sent off to live with his uncle in order to get an education. His uncle indoctrinated him in the ways of Iraqi nationalism and the Baath party. His early hero was Abdel Nasser of [[Egypt]], who confronted the West and gained his Arab nationalist credentials. Saddam was part of an attempted Iraqi uprising, which failed and forced him to Egypt, law school, and high ranks in Egyptian Baath party until he was able to return to Iraq. From there he was appointed successor to [[Michel Aflaq]], the father of the Baath party. In Saddam's efforts to become the Supreme Arab Nationalist Leader, he had to compete against Assad of [[Syria]].

Throughout his tenure, Saddam killed supporters who gave advice contrary to his thinking, and thus surrounded himself with sycophants. He warred with the [[Kurds]] and Iranians and was pragmatic enough to change his mind regarding the Shatt al Arab Waterway, his foreign hostage policy, and the War with Iran, which had started going badly for the Iraqis. To his mind, Saddam is Iraq and Iraq is Saddam. He was a [[Narcissism|narcissist]] who believed he was the chosen leader of the [[Arab world]], despite lack of support for the [[Kuwait]] invasion. Paranoid, he was convinced in conspiracies of the US, [[Israel]], and [[Iran]] to kill him. After the Kuwait invasion and defeat, he worked to shore up his forces and eventually began to trust party loyalists over his family, including two of his sons whom he killed after giving them amnesty. His goal is survival and a place in the world state with world class weapons. When backed into a corner, he fights with everything he has but can change his mind and compromise to be seen as a global leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Post|first=Jerrold|title=The Psychological Assessment of Political Leaders|year=2005|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Critical pedagogy}}'''''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''''' is a 1977 book on [[education]], written by [[Great Britain|British]] social scientist and [[Cultural studies|cultural theorist]] [[Paul Willis]]. A [[Columbia University Press]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;edition, titled the "Morningside Edition," was published in the [[United States]] shortly after its reception.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning to Labor: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs|last=Willis|first=Paul|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1981|isbn=0-231-05357-6|location=New York, NY|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Willis's first major book, ''Learning to Labour'' relates the findings of his [[Ethnography|ethnographic study]] of [[Working class|working-class]] boys at a [[secondary school]] in [[England]]. In it, Willis attempts to explain the role of [[Youth|youths']] [[culture]] and [[socialization]] as mediums by which schools route working-class students into working-class jobs. [[Stanley Aronowitz]], in the preface to the Morningside edition, hails the book as a key text in [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[social reproduction]] theory about education, advancing previous work in education studies by [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] and [[Herbert Gintis|Herbert Gintis's]] [[Schooling in Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life|Schooling in Capitalist America]], as well as work by [[Michael Apple]] and [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

''Learning to Labour'' has been recognized by [[Sociology|sociologists]], [[Critical pedagogy|critical pedagogues]], and researchers in education studies as a landmark study of schooling and culture, and is one of the most cited sociological texts in education studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning to Labor in New Times|last=Dolby|first=Nadine|last2=Dimitriadis|first2=Greg|last7=|publisher=Routledge Falmer|year=2004|isbn=0-415-94854-1|editor-last=Dolby|editor-first=Nadine|location=New York, NY|pages=1–2|chapter=Learning to Labor in New Times: An Introduction|quote=|editor-last2=Dimitriadis|editor-first2=Greg|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Arnot, Madeleine. "Male Working-Class Identities and Social Justice: A Reconsideration of Paul Willis's ''Learning to Labor'' in Light of Contemporary Research." ''Learning to Labor in New Times''. pp. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
''Learning to Labour'' represents Paul Willis's ethnographic [[Field research|fieldwork]] with twelve [[Working class|working-class]] British male students, attending their second-to-last year of schooling at "Hammertown Boys," a modern, boys-only school in a town in [[The Midlands|the British Midlands]]. Beginning in 1972, Willis followed the boys for about six months, observing their social behavior with each other and their school and interviewing them periodically. He also studied them at later points up until 1976. The makeup of Hammertown Boys, and Hammertown, is largely working-class, with some [[Immigration|immigrants]] from [[South Asia]] and the [[West Indies]]. At the time of the study, the local school system was expanding its infrastructure and exploring new pedagogical methods, thanks to the implementation of the [[Raising of school leaving age in England and Wales|Raising of School Leaving Age]] policies in September [[1972]] that were in line with [[education reform]]s that sought to keep youth in schools for a greater span of time, as well as offer them opportunities for gainful employment and [[Social mobility|socioeconomic mobility]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Willis's research was made possible by funding through the [[Social Science Research Council]]. Willis acknowledged the advice and support of members of the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], including cultural theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], in writing in the book.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Summary ==
''Learning to Labour'' is organized into two sections: ethnography and analysis. In Part One, Willis describes and analyzes the nonconformist counter-school culture produced by Hammertown Boys' [[White people|White]], working-class boys (called "lads"). In this section, he applies [[thick description]] and ethnographic analysis to the counter-school culture of the lads, recognizing the legitimacy and reality of the students' own interpretive accounts of schooling. In Part Two, Willis analyzes his own ethnography to produce a theoretical account of how counter-school culture plays a vital role in leading working-class students into subordinate, low-wage labor positions in adult life, fulfilling what he calls their "self-damnation."&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. pp. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Working-class youths' recognition of, and reaction against, the dominating, [[Discipline|disciplinary]] mechanisms of school help seal their future outcomes as workers, in turn enabling the social reproduction of [[Social class|class positions]].

=== Part One: Ethnography ===
Willis uses the [[qualitative research]] methods of participant observation and group interviews to study an informal (but socially cohesive) group of twelve lads at Hammertown Boys. He distinguishes between two distinct, informal groups of the working-class students at Hammertown Boys: lads and 'ear'oles. Whereas the lads are those nonconformist students who defy authority, 'ear'oles are those conformist students who invest themselves in formal learning and academic achievement, and therefore in the authority of teachers and the school system. The term "'ear'ole" recalls the earhole or [[earlobe]], signifying conformist students' passive reception of learning. This contrasts with lads' rowdy, active behaviour in school. The lads perceive themselves as more manly, more authentic, and more independent than the 'ear'oles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The lads informally socialise and organise themselves against the 'ear'oles and the school as an institution, producing a culture of nonconformity, rebellion, and opposition to their school's authority figures and strictures. It is not only important that the lads smoke and [[Heterosexuality|have sex with girls]], but are seen to smoke and recognized to have had sexual liaisons. Behaviours that define the forms of this culture, such as playing pranks on teachers, harassing conformist students, and refusing to inform teachers of each other's behaviour, also build a sense of solidarity and identity among their group. The lads' culture is also [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] and [[Racism|racist]], as girls and non-Whites are excluded from their informal group. It also strongly identifies with the actual, working-class environment from which it originates. In terms of working-class identity, their culture has much in common with the culture of working-class shop floors. This includes the active search for producing moments of excitement, disorder, and enjoyment in what is an otherwise boring, routine, and meaningless span of time of work for adult workers, and [[school discipline]] for students.

Over the course of their time as Hammertown Boys, the lads were recognised by school authorities as a distinct "anti-school group." However, when they were of age to legally leave school, in their fifth year in secondary school, few of them did.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. pp. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, as the lads took career-preparation lessons in school, they rejected the legitimacy of formal credentials and qualifications, prizing instead manual labour as superior to and more authentic than mental labour. This inverted the lessons' insinuation of mental labour’s being more desirable than [[manual labour]] by dint of its higher [[socioeconomic status]]. By the end of the ethnography, the lads were easily able to enter working-class jobs, including [[Plumber|plumbing]], [[Bricklayer|bricklaying]], and trainee [[Machinist|machine work]]. However, half of them left their job for another after one year of work, and one was unable to find work at all. Willis ended the ethnographic study in autumn 1976, with the lads routed into working-class labour with little hope of rising into the [[middle class]], even as they subjectively experienced manual labour and income as empowering. Willis writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;There is also a sense in which, despite the ravages -- fairly well contained at this point anyway -- manual work stands for something and is a way of contributing to and substantiating a certain view of life which criticises, scorns and devalues others as well as putting the self, as they feel it, in some elusive way ahead of the game. These feelings arise precisely from a sense of their own labour power which has been learnt and truly appropriated as insight and self-advance within the depths of the counter-school culture as it develops specific class forms in the institutional context. It is difficult to think how attitudes of such strength and informal and personal validity could have been formed in any other way. It is they, not formal schooling, which carry 'the lads' over into a certain application to the productive process. In a sense, therefore, there is an element of self-domination in the acceptance of subordinate roles in western capitalism. However, this damnation is experienced, paradoxically, as a form of true learning, appropriation and as a kind of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Part Two: Analysis ===
In the second half of ''Learning to Labour'', Willis synthesises his observations of the lads' counter-school culture at Hammertown Boys in order to produce a theory of social reproduction that integrates culture as a key element alongside education. He proposes that the working-class lads enter working-class jobs of their own apparent volition, but this is not to be understood as merely a psychological inclination toward these jobs, nor as merely the deterministic effect of capitalist [[ideology]] persuading them to select them. Rather, it is in school that the lads acquire a distorted [[class consciousness]] through their counter-school culture, in which they end up embracing working-class, manual labor as more affirming and authentic. A rebellious culture can successfully oppose the norms of capitalism transmitted in school, but the success is, in Willis's terms, a "pyrrhic victory," for they end up taking on working-class jobs as adults.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In his analysis, Willis defines and uses the following concepts: 
* '''Teaching paradigm:''' The teaching paradigm is the principal set of demands and incentives used by the school system. According to this paradigm, students consent to behave obediently and in deference to their teacher in exchange for promised credentials that will help them move upward socioeconomically. This paradigm, which helps the teacher with authority, implies the desirability of obedience, deference, and conformity for working-class students, and recalls the banking paradigm in [[Paulo Freire|Paulo Freire's]] ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paulo|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2000|isbn=0-8264-1276-9|location=New York, NY|pages=72–75|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Willis notes the importance of teachers' winning from their students consent to the teaching paradigm, as their exchange-based authority does not permit them to directly impose it on students.
* '''Differentiation''' and '''integration''': Willis describes differentiation as the process by which working-class students reinterpret, invert, criticize, and reject the teaching paradigm as failing to meet their objective interests as members of the working class. Aspects of differentiation constitute, in part, the lads' counter-school culture. Integration is the opposite of differentiation, the process by which agents of the school system, such as teachers, attempt to legitimise the role of schooling in improving students' lives. The tug-of-war between differentiation and integration is, in Willis's observation, continually manifested through day-to-day contests between teachers attempting to maintain their authority and lads attempting to subvert it. 
* '''Penetration''' and '''limitation''': These struggles between the lads and teachers occasionally lead to penetration, which denotes the lads' insights into their own class condition, as interpreted through the lens of their counter-school culture. It is through penetrations that working-class youth recognise the illusions of the teaching paradigm, and more generally of [[liberal democracy]] and [[Capitalism|capitalism's]] promises of advancement through education. Willis notes, however, that penetrations are, for anyone immersed in their own culture, partial and disorganised, meaning that they are culturally, subjectively distorted, and unable to bloom into [[Political radicalism|politically radical]] class consciousness. Later, he describes this partiality as limitations. The limitations of penetrations grant the lads a sense of freedom, affirmation, solidarity, and empowerment in their rebellion and embrace of working-class identity. For example, that the lads understand the teaching paradigm's valuation of mental labour as superior to manual labour is a penetration; on the other hand, that they respond by culturally affirming manual labour over mental labour, as more sensual and authentic, shows the partiality of their perpetration. Willis also identifies limitations in the intersection of patriarchy and capitalism: The lads approach manual labour as a means to accomplish a [[Masculinity|masculine identity]], and identify [[gender]] [[domestic labor|domestic labour]] and mental labour as girlish and "[[Sissy|cissy]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. pp. 147-149.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''[[Ideology]]''': Drawing on the theory of [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], Willis argues that schools are also complicit in social reproduction as [[Ideological State Apparatus|state institutions for ideology]]. [[Career counseling]] programs in secondary school emphasise individual competition, promote the desirability of [[White-collar worker|white-collar labour]], and [[Reification (Marxism)|reify]] adult work as an inevitable and natural stage of life. Ideology also has the power to undo any successful penetrations, by acknowledging the facts of [[economic inequality]] and domination in the workplace by [[Supervisor|bosses]], without organising these facts in any kind of systematic framework of class, [[wage labour]], and exploitation. Ideology and penetration are at odds, and help determine the degree to which working-class youth identify with the working class. 
In ''Learning to Labour'', the informal, creative, counter-school culture of the lads is vital to understanding the reproduction of class structure. Willis notes that working-class cultures are distinct in that they have no stake in subscribing to the dominant capitalist ideology, and therefore have the potential to subvert it. Yet it is this subversion that routes the lads into working-class labour, seemingly of their own volition. They use culture to explain and interpret the structures of schooling and work that enfold them, but doing so also steers them into social reproduction.

Willis warns against an overtly deterministic mode of social reproduction, encouraging the consideration of culture in a mediating role. He also warns against policy that would focus strictly on changing culture as a means to change material outcomes in education and labour. ''Learning to Labour'' ends with several practical suggestions for changing education accordingly, including:
* Recognising the competition inherent to an educational [[meritocracy]] 
* Respecting the insights and logic of youth working-class culture 
* Communicating to students without denigrating their social identities 
* Discussing elements of students' own cultural forms, including wage labour, [[street fighting]], sexism, and rebellion 
* Recognising the limits of pedagogy and teaching paradigms in reaching disaffected working-class students, as well as the necessity of some authority in classrooms. Although Willis acknowledges the possibility of using radical pedagogical methods, he suggests they would be ineffective for students as the Hammertown Boys lads, who are likely to register a teacher's withdrawal from authority as simply their victory over him.
In his afterword to the Morningside Edition, Willis reflected that ''Learning to Labour'' contributed to the academic literature of education by advancing social reproduction theory and by asserting the complicity of both liberal educational policies and student in causing educational and socioeconomic inequality. While researchers must be skeptical of schools' purported role in improving social mobility, schools are not all-powerful in reproducing class:&lt;blockquote&gt;There may be a justified skepticism about liberal claims in education, but the "Reproduction" perspective moves too quickly to a simple version of their opposite. Apparently, education unproblematically does the bidding of the capitalist economy by inserting working class agents into unequal futures ... The actually varied, complex, and creative field of human consciousness, culture, and capacity is reduced to the dry abstraction of structural determination. Capital requires it, therefore schools do it! Humans become dummies, dupes, or zombies. Their innermost sensibilities are freely drawn on. The school is even the main site for this cosmic drawing; for all we are told of how this actually happens, schools may as well be "black boxes." This will not do theoretically. It certainly will not do politically. Pessimism reigns supreme in this, the most spectacular of secular relations of pre-determination.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reception ==
''Learning to Labour'' was received with wide acclaim.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Aronowitz. "Foreword." ''Learning to Labor in New Times''. pp. x-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years after its original release,  Willis discussed his research with a variety of educators and community groups, who provided both support and criticism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An anthology of essays, titled ''Learning to Labour in New Times'', was published in 2004, growing from a 2002 [[American Educational Research Association]] meeting to recognise ''Learning to Labour''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s 25th anniversary. [[Jean Anyon]], Michael Apple, [[Peter McLaren]], and other academics contributed essays to the anthology, applying Willis's ethnography to contemporary issues of gender, race, [[neoliberalism]], [[Precarious work|work precarity]], [[globalization|globalisation]], media, and [[United States incarceration rate|mass incarceration in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Aronowitz. "Foreword." ''Learning to Labor in New Times''. pp. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Black people|Black]] youth in United States schools develop cultures of oppositionality, collective identity, and "tough fronts," similar to the Hammertown lads, but are led to incarceration instead of working-class jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Kathleen; Anyon, Jean.

In the wider field of cultural studies, ''Learning to Labour'' was recognized as an important text in [[youth studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postmodernism and Popular Culture|last=McRobbie|first=Angela|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0-203-16833X|location=New York, NY|pages=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as working-class leisure and culture, whereas other contemporaneous leftist research in the social sciences tended to foreground employment, [[Trade union|labour unions]], and political organizations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McRobbie|first=Angela|year=1980|title=Settling Accounts with Subcultures: A Feminist Critique|journal=Screen Education|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Willis acknowledged that shortly after its first release, some right-wing policymakers and politicians sought to appropriate its findings to justify [[Tracking (education)|tracking]] and legitimate educational inequality.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. pp. 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; While Willis repudiated this use of his work, he even more strongly criticised well-intending, liberal policies that sought to extirpate counter-school cultures: &lt;blockquote&gt;Besides, even in the worst case of interpretation and action taken on the book-the "oiling" paradigm-a cynical recognition of actual cultures is preferable to their attempted destruction as "pathological" cases, or their chimerical projection into shocking Satanic forms visited upon us from nowhere. "Solutions" based on such myths are likely to be cruel because their recipients were never seen as real people.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs.'' p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Willis further advanced concepts of profane, working-class youth culture and symbolic labour in his 1990 book ''Common Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Common Culture|last=Willis|first=Paul|publisher=Open University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-8133-1097-0|location=Buckingham, UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, Peter; Scatamburlo-D'Annibale. "Paul Willis, Class Consciousness, and Critical Pedagogy." ''Learning to Labor in New Times''. pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Researchers in education and [[cultural studies]], including [[Angela McRobbie]], criticized ''Learning to Labour'' for neglecting girls and conformist male students in its study. McRobbie wrote that Willis's study took little concern with the overt and violent sexism of the lads falling into a wider pattern of cultural studies' failure to prioritise gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McRobbie|first=Angela|date=2010|title=Reflections on Feminism, Immaterial Labour and the Post-Fordist Regime|journal=New Formations|volume=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism and Youth Culture: From Jackie to Just Seventeen|last=McRobbie|first=Angela|publisher=Unwin Hyman|year=1991|isbn=978-0333452646|location=Boston|pages=18|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Willis acknowledged this sexism, but replied that he had indeed incorporated a construction of working-class [[masculinity]] as "self-entrapment."&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Willis's ethnography was also criticised for an unclear methodology, inviting questions of [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and generalization as a "fish 'n' chips ethnography.'"&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, Gord (1980). "Cries from the School Corridors of North York, Birmingham and Tyneside." ''This Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers also replied to ''Learning to Labour'' that cultures of resistance were absent in their own classrooms. In turn, Willis argued that such cultures are not immediately obvious, and may be interpreted as individualised behaviours. Moreover, studies of student culture require extensive fieldwork to generate [[Validity (statistics)|validity]], and quantitative methods such as surveys, which may produce greater reliability, cannot satisfactorily report on cultural forms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Macroinvertebrate Community Index''' (MCI) is an [[Index (statistics)|index]] used in [[New Zealand]] to measure the [[water quality]] of fresh water streams.&lt;ref name="LAWADefn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Macroinvertebrate Community Index|url=https://www.lawa.org.nz/learn/glossary/m/macroinvertebrate-community-index-(mci)|website=www.lawa.org.nz|publisher=Land Air Water Aoteraroa|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence or lack of [[invertebrate|macroinvertebrates]] such as insects, worms and snails in a river or stream can give a [[Bioindicator|biological indicator]] on the health of that waterway.&lt;ref name="MFEMCI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Macroinvertebrate Community Composition (MCI)|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/more/environmental-reporting/reporting-act/fresh-water/river-condition-indicator/macroinvertebrates|website=Ministry for the Environment|publisher=Government of New Zealand|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCI assigns a number to each [[species]] of macroinvertebrate based on the sensitivity of that species to [[pollution]]. The index then calculates an average score.&lt;ref name="LAWADefn"/&gt; A higher score on the MCI generally indicates a more healthy stream.&lt;ref name="MFEMCI"/&gt;

The '''MCI (Macro invertebrate Community Index)''' relies on an allocation of scores to freshwater macroinvertebrates based on their pollution tolerances. Freshwater macroinvertebrates found in pristine conditions would score higher than those found in polluted areas.&lt;ref name="STARK 1993"&gt;Stark, J. D. (1993) Performance of the Macroinvertebrate Community Index: Effects of sampling method, sample replication, water depth, current velocity, and substratum on index values. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 27:4, 463-478.&lt;/ref&gt; MCI values can be calculated using macroinvertebrate presence-absence data using this equation:&lt;ref name="STARK 1993"/&gt;

'''MCI = [(site score)/(# of scoring taxa)]*20'''

Previous [[water quality]] assessments have relied on both chemical and habitat analysis, however, these methods have been proven to be insufficient due to pollution from nonpoint sources.&lt;ref name="BENNETT"&gt;Bennett, H. H., M. W. Mullen, P. M. Stewart, J. A. Sawyer, and E. C. W. (2004) Development of an Invertebrate Community Index for an Alabama Coastal Plain Watershed. Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 40:1, 43-51&lt;/ref&gt; Species living in an aquatic environment may be the best natural indicator of environmental quality and reveal the effects of any habitat alteration or pollution,&lt;ref name="BENNETT"/&gt; and have proved to respond to a wide range of stressors such as [[sedimentation]], [[urbanization]], [[agricultural]] practices and forest harvesting effects.&lt;ref name="COLLIER"&gt;Collier, KJ. (2014) Wood decay rates and macroinvertebrate community structure along contrasting human pressure gradients (Waikato, New Zealand), New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 48:1, 97-111&lt;/ref&gt; Any changes that may occur in macroinvertebrate communities that lead to a reduction in diversity increase the dominance of pollution-tolerant invertebrates, such as [[oligochaetes]] and [[chironomids]].&lt;ref name="HALL"&gt;Hall, M. J., G. P. Closs and R. H. Riley. (2001) Relationships between land use and stream invertebrate community structure in a South Island, New Zealand, coastal stream catchment. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 35:3, 591-603&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a lack of species diversity and low [[biotic index]] scores of inhabitant macroinvertebrates may be an indicator of poor water quality.&lt;ref name="COLLINS"&gt;Collins, C. L., M. W. Mullen, P. M. Stewart, and E. C. Webber. (2008) Validation of an Invertebrate Community Index for Urban Streams for an Alabama Coastal Plains Watershed. Journal of The American Water Resources Association, 44(3), 663-669&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of water quality degradation is the greatest in low-elevation areas, where high intensity agriculture and urban development are the dominant land uses.&lt;ref name="LARNED"&gt;Larned, S. T., T. Snelder, M. J. Unwin, and G.B. McBride. (2016) Water quality in New Zealand rivers: current state and trends. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 50:3, 389-417&lt;/ref&gt;

Macro invertebrate communities are the preferred indicators of aquatic ecosystem health because they are very easy to both collect and identify, and have short life spans, thus responding very quickly to changes in their environment.&lt;ref name="COLLIER"/&gt; The MCI methods of utilizing macroinvertebrate communities to assess the overall health of an aquatic environment continues to be the most reliable, applicable, and widely acclaimed method around the world.&lt;ref name="OLOMUKORO"&gt;Olomukoro, J. O. and A. Dirisu. (2014) Macroinvertebrate Community and Pollution Tolerance Index in Edion and Omodo Rivers in Derived Savannah Wetlands in Southern Nigeria. Jordan Journal of Biological Sciences, 7:1, 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Variations on the MCI'''

In addition to the MCI indexed defined above, there are also two other variations of the MCI. The QMCI (Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index) and the SQMCI (Semi-Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index). Both MCI and QMCI are widely used in countries like New Zealand. The combination of widespread use and good performance of the MCI and the QMCI in detecting water quality in aquatic ecosystems has sparked interest in further refinement of the methods in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"&gt;Stark, J. D. (1998) SQMCI: A biotic index for freshwater macroinvertebrate coded‐abundance data. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 32:1, 55-66.&lt;/ref&gt; The QMCI, just like the MCI, was initially designed to evaluate the organic enrichment in aquatic ecosystems. The third index, the SQMCI, was created to reduce sampling and processing efforts required for the QMCI.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"&gt;Wright‐Stow, A. E. and Winterbourn, M. J. (2003) How well do New Zealand's stream‐monitoring indicators, the macroinvertebrate community index and its quantitative variant, correspond? New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 37:2, 461-470.&lt;/ref&gt; The SQMCI will respond in a similar matter to the QMCI in community dominance, however, will require fewer samples to achieve the same precision. The SQMCI gives a comparative appraisal to the QMCI with under 40% of the [[exertion]], in circumstances that macroinvertebrate densities are not required. This diminishes expenses and also enhances the logical solidness of biomonitoring projects.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"/&gt; Both the QMCI and SQMCI are similar to the MCI in the way that they are graded on a 1 (extremely tolerant) to 10 (highly intolerant) scale. However, they differ in the way that MCI is calculated using presence-absence data whereas QMCI uses quantitative or percentage data.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt; Having a qualitative, quantitative, and semi-quantitative version of the same index has raised some questions as to if this is a good thing or not. All three indexes have the same purpose, which is to measure the quality of an aquatic ecosystem, however, there are no clear recommendations about when each one is most appropriate to be used. In a study conducted on 88 rivers, Searsbrook et al. (2000) concluded MCI is more useful than the QMCI for recognizing changes in stream water quality over time. Having three forms of a similar index may prompt to various conclusions and also opens the route for specific utilization of either file to give bias to a specific position or position taken by a specialist.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt; Consistency on the different versions of MCI have not yet been formally measured despite the communication that has been made to the public, managers and politicians.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt;
	

'''QMCI values can be calculated using:
QMCI = ∑_(i=1)^(i=s)▒(n_i*a_i)/N'''

SQMCI values can be calculated similar to QMCI except that coded abundances are substituted for actual counts. Example:

'''SQMCI = ∑_(i=1)^(i=s)▒(n_i*a_i)/N'''

'''Factors Influencing MCI'''
There are several factors which can affect the data acquisition of MCI when assessing the water quality of an aquatic ecosystem. Hard-bottom and Soft-bottom channels can often yield different results and many researchers will use two different versions of the MCI. For example, in a study by Stark &amp; Mallard (2007) they discuss that hard and soft bottom channels have separate versions of the MCI and the two versions can not be combined into one data set because of the differences in [[taxa]] and tolerance values.&lt;ref name="LARNED"/&gt;
	

[[Spatial variability]] is also of interest in terms of affecting the data acquired through MCI. Sites which are progressively down stream often tend to yield a lower MCI value. There may also be confounding influences between riffles, runs, or pools with a single stream reach.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"&gt;Stark, J. D. and N. Phillips. (2009) Seasonal variability in the Macroinvertebrate Community Index: Are seasonal correction factors required? New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 43:4, 867-882&lt;/ref&gt;
	

Depth and velocity have also been raised as a concern with regards to effecting results, however Stark (1993) investigated the influences of the sampling method, water depth, current velocity and [[substratum]] on the results and found that both MCI and QMCI are independent of depth, velocity, and substratum from macroinvertebrate samples collected from stony riffles.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"/&gt; This finding is an advantage for the assessment of water pollution.
	

There have been several studies conducted on seasonal variability, which has been considered the main influential factor on the assessment of water quality. It has been concluded that all models should test data that has been collected in the season as the reference data, which is being used.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"/&gt;
	

There have been several other factors such as water temperature, invertebrate life histories and dissolved oxygen levels that have all been explained as causes of seasonal variability. Warmer seasons have biotic indices that are indicative of poorer stream health.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"/&gt; Warmer seasons such as summer, would have increased temperatures therefore increasing water temperature and decreasing the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water making the environment less ideal to aquatic macroinvertebrates. In return, this effects the density of macroinvertebrate population and changes the results of the indices.

The '''George C. Marshall Space Flight Center''' ('''MSFC'''), located in Huntsville, Alabama, is the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]'s civilian [[rocket]]ry and [[spacecraft propulsion]] research center.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/msfcfactsheet11032016.pdf |title=Marshall Space Flight Center Fact Sheet |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=November 3, 2016 |website=NASAfacts |publisher=NASA |access-date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest [[NASA]] center, MSFC's first mission was developing the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn launch vehicles]] for the [[Apollo program|Apollo Moon program]]. Marshall has been the agency's lead center for [[Space Shuttle]] propulsion and its [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]]; payloads and related crew training; [[International Space Station]] (ISS) design and assembly; and computers, networks, and information management. Located on the [[Redstone Arsenal]] near [[Huntsville, Alabama]], MSFC is named in honor of [[General of the Army (United States)|Army General]] [[George Marshall]].

The center also contains the '''Huntsville Operations Support Center''' ('''HOSC'''), a facility that supports ISS launch, payload and experiment activities at the [[Kennedy Space Center]]. The HOSC also monitors rocket launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] when a Marshall Center payload is on board.

==History==
After the end of the war with Germany in May 1945, a program was initiated to bring to the United States a number of scientists and engineers who had been at the center of Germany's advanced military technologies. The largest and best-known activity was called [[Operation Paperclip]]. In August 1945, 127 missile specialists led by [[Wernher von Braun]] signed work contracts with the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army's Ordnance Corps]]. Most of them had worked on the [[V-2]] missile development under von Braun at [[Peenemünde]]. 
Von Braun and the other Germans were sent to [[Fort Bliss, Texas]], joining the Army's newly formed Research and Development Division Sub-office (Rocket).

For the next five years, von Braun and the German scientists and engineers were primarily engaged in adapting and improving the V-2 missile for U.S. applications; testing was conducted at nearby [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico]]. Von Braun had long had a great interest in rocketry for space science and exploration. Toward this, he was allowed to use a [[WAC Corporal]] rocket as a second stage for a V-2; the combination, called Bumper, reached a record-breaking {{convert|250|mi|km}} altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Fidenbach, Peter L.; [http://nmsua.edu/tiopete/files/2008/12/wspgcoldbook.pdf "A Brief History of White Sands Proving Ground"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028154222/http://nmsua.edu/tiopete/files/2008/12/wspgcoldbook.pdf|date=2014-10-28}}, N.M. State Univ.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, the production and storage of ordnance shells was conducted by three arsenals nearby to [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. After the war, these were closed, and the three areas were combined to form [[Redstone Arsenal]]. In October 1948, the Chief of Ordnance designated Redstone Arsenal as the center of research and development activities in free-flight rockets and related items, and the following June, the Ordnance Rocket Center was opened. A year later, the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] approved the transfer of the rocket research and development activities from [[Fort Bliss]] to the new center at Redstone Arsenal. Beginning in April 1950, about 1,000 persons were involved in the transfer, including von Braun's group. At this time, R&amp;D responsibility for guided missiles was added, and studies began on a medium-range guided missile that eventually became the [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone]] rocket.

Over the next decade, the missile development on Redstone Arsenal greatly expanded. Many small free-flight and guided rockets were developed, and work on the Redstone rocket got underway. Although this rocket was primarily intended for military purposes, von Braun kept space firmly in his mind, and published a widely read article on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;Wernher von Braun; [[Man Will Conquer Space Soon!|"Crossing the Last Frontier"]], ''Collier's Magazine'', March 22, 1952, pp. 24–29, 72, 74&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1952, the Germans who had initially worked under individual contracts were converted to civil service employees, and in 1954-55, most became U.S. citizens. Von Braun was appointed Chief of the Guided Missile Development Division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/chron2b/welcome.html "Redstone Arsenal Complex Chronology, Part II: Nerve Center of Army Missilery, 1950-62 - Section B: The ABMA/AOMC Era, 1956-62"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716183621/http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/chron2b/welcome.html |date=2006-07-16 }}. Redstone Arsenal Historical Information. United States Army&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1954, von Braun proposed using the Redstone as the main booster of a multi-stage rocket for launching artificial satellites. A year later, a study for [[Project Orbiter]] was completed, detailing plans and schedules for a series of scientific satellites. The Army's official role in the U.S. space satellite program was delayed, however, after higher authorities elected to use the [[Vanguard (rocket)|Vanguard rocket]] then being developed by the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL).

In February 1956, the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA) was established; von Braun was the director of the Development Operations Division. One of the primary programs was a {{convert|1500|mi|km|adj=on}}, single-stage missile that was started the previous year; intended for both the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy, this was designated the [[PGM-19 Jupiter]]. Guidance component testing for this Jupiter intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) began in March 1956 on a modified Redstone missile dubbed Jupiter A while re-entry vehicle testing began in September 1956 on a Redstone with spin-stabilized upper stages named Jupiter-C. The first Jupiter IRBM flight took place from Cape Canaveral in March 1957 with the first successful flight to full range on 31 May.&lt;ref&gt;James N. Gibson, ''Nuclear Weapons of the United States, An Illustrated History'', p. 167, Schiffer Publishing Ltd., Atglen, PA, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Jupiter was eventually taken over by the U.S. Air Force. The ABMA developed [[Jupiter-C]] was composed of a Redstone rocket first stage and two upper stages for RV tests or three upper stages for Explorer satellite launches. ABMA had originally planned the 20 September 1956 flight as a satellite launch but, by direct intervention of Eisenhower, was limited to the use of 2 upper stages for an RV test flight traveling {{convert|3350|mi|km}} and attaining an altitude of {{convert|682|mi|km}}. While the Jupiter C capability was such that it could have placed the fourth stage in orbit, that mission had been assigned to the NRL.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/expinfo.html "Data Sheet - Explorer-1 and Jupiter-C"], Dept. of Astronautics, National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Wolfe and W. J. Truscott, ''Juno Final Report Volume 1, Juno 1: Re-entry Test Vehicles and Explorer Satellites'', JPL, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; Later Jupiter-C flights would be used to launch satellites.

The Soviet Union launched [[Sputnik 1]], the first man-made earth satellite, on October 4, 1957. This was followed on November 3 with the second satellite, [[Sputnik 2]]. The United States attempted a satellite launch on December 6, using the NRL's Vanguard rocket, but it barely struggled off the ground, then fell back and exploded. On January 31, 1958, after finally receiving permission to proceed, von Braun and the ABMA space development team used a Jupiter C in a [[Juno I]] configuration (addition of a fourth stage) to successfully place [[Explorer 1]], the first American satellite, into orbit around the earth.

Effective at the end of March 1958, the U.S. Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC), was established at Redstone Arsenal. This encompassed the ABMA and its newly operational space programs. In August, AOMC and [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA, a Department of Defense organization) jointly initiated a program managed by ABMA to develop a large space booster of approximately 1.5-million-pounds thrust using a cluster of available rocket engines. In early 1959, this vehicle was designated [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]].

On April 2, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] recommended to Congress that a civilian agency be established to direct nonmilitary space activities, and on July 29, the President signed the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]], creating the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). The nucleus for forming NASA was the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), with its 7,500 employees and [[Ames Research Center]] (ARC), [[Langley Research Center]] (LaRC), and [[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory]] (later LRC, then Glenn RC) becoming the initial operations of NASA.

Despite the existence of an official space agency, the Army continued with certain far-reaching space programs. In June 1959, a secret study on [[Project Horizon]] was completed by ABMA, detailing plans for using the Saturn booster in establishing a manned Army outpost on the Moon. Project Horizon, however, was rejected, and the Saturn program was transferred to NASA.

[[File:army nasa transfer 01.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremony of transfer from Army to NASA July 1, 1960]]
The U.S. manned satellite space program, using the Redstone as a booster, was officially named [[Project Mercury]] on November 26, 1958. With a future goal of manned flight, monkeys Able and Baker were the first living creatures recovered from outer space on May 28, 1959. They had been carried in the [[nose cone]] on a Jupiter missile to an altitude of {{convert|300|mi|km}} and a distance of {{convert|1500|mi|km}}, successfully withstanding 38 times the normal pull of gravity. Their survival during speeds over 10,000 miles per hour was America's first biological step toward putting a man into space.

On October 21, 1959, President Eisenhower approved the transfer of all Army space-related activities to NASA. This was accomplished effective July 1, 1960, when 4,670 civilian employees, about $100 million worth of buildings and equipment, and {{convert|1,840|acre|km2}} of land transferred from AOMC/ABMA to NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center. MSFC officially opened at Redstone Arsenal on this same date, then was dedicated on September 8 by President Eisenhower in person. The Center was named in honor of [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[George Marshall|George C. Marshall]], Army [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff]] during World War II, [[United States Secretary of State]], and [[Nobel Prize]] winner for his world-renowned [[Marshall Plan]].

==Capabilities and projects==
From its initiation, MSFC has been NASA's lead center for the development of rocket propulsion systems and technologies. During the 1960s, the activities were largely devoted to the [[Apollo Program]] – man's first visit to the Moon. In this, the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn Family]] of launch vehicles were designed and tested at MSFC. Following the highly successful [[Moon landing]], including initial scientific exploration, MSFC had a major role in Post-Apollo activities; this included [[Skylab]], the United States' first space station. With a permanent space station as an objective, the [[Space Shuttle]] was developed as a reusable transportation vehicle, and with it came [[Spacelab]] and other experimental activities making use of the Shuttle’ cargo bay. These and other projects are described in a later section. But first, MSFC's present capabilities and projects are addressed.

===Present and future – 2000s onward===
Marshall Space Flight Center has capabilities and projects supporting NASA's mission in three key areas: lifting from Earth (Space Vehicles), living and working in space (International Space Station), and understanding our world and beyond (Advanced Scientific Research).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/missions/index.html|title=Marshall Missions|first=Jennifer|last=Harbaugh|date=3 March 2015|website=nasa.gov|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Space vehicles====
MSFC is NASA's designated developer and integrator of launch systems. The state-of-the-art Propulsion Research Laboratory serves as a leading national resource for advanced space propulsion research. Marshall has the engineering capabilities to take space vehicles from initial concept to sustained service. For manufacturing, the world's largest-known welding machine of its type was installed at MSFC in 2008; it is capable of building major, defect-free components for manned-rated space vehicles.

In early March 2011, NASA Headquarters announced that MSFC will lead the efforts on a new heavy-lift rocket that, like the Saturn V of the lunar exploration program of the late 1960s, will carry large, [[Human-rating certification|man-rated]]  payloads beyond low-Earth orbit. The Center will have the program office for what is being called the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://marshallstar.msfc.nasa.gov/3-3-11.pdf "SLS program office at Marshall"], ''Marshall Star'', March 3, 2011, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Constellation Program=====
Before it was cancelled by President [[Barack Obama]] in early 2010, the [[Constellation Program]] had been a major activity in NASA since 2004. In this program, MSFC was responsible for propulsion on the heavy-lift vehicles. These vehicles were designated [[Ares I]] and [[Ares V]], and would replace the aging [[Space Shuttle]] fleet as well as transport humans to the Moon, Mars, and other deep-space destinations.&lt;ref&gt;Connolly, John F.; [http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163092main_constellation_program_overview.pdf "Constellation Program Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710060512/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163092main_constellation_program_overview.pdf |date=2007-07-10 }}", NASA Constellation Program Office, October 2006; .&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2006, the MSFC Exploration Launch Projects Office began work on the Ares projects. On October 28, 2009, an Ares I-X test rocket lifted off from the newly modified [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39B]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) for a two-minute powered flight; then continued for four additional minutes traveling {{convert|150|mi|km}} down range.

=====Space Shuttle=====
MSFC had responsibility for the Space Shuttle's propulsion engines. On February 1, 2003, the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] occurred, with the orbiter disintegrating during reentry and resulting in the death of its seven crew members. Flights of the other Shuttles were put on hold for 29 months. Based on a seven-month investigation, including a ground search that recovered debris from about 38 percent of the Orbiter, together with telemetry data and launch films, indicated that the failure was caused by a piece of insulation that broke off the [[external tank]] during launch and damaged the [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection]] on the Orbiter's left wing.

MSFC was responsible for the external tank, but few or no changes to the tank were made; rather, NASA decided that it was inevitable that some insulation might be lost during launch and thus required that an inspection of the orbiter's critical elements be made prior to reentry on future flights.

NASA retired the Space Shuttle in 2011, leaving America dependent upon the Russian  [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|''Soyuz'']] spacecraft for manned space missions.

=====Orbital Space Plane=====
The initial plans for the Space Station envisaged a small, low-cost [[Crew Return Vehicle]] (CRV) that would provide emergency evacuation capability. The 1986 Challenger disaster led planners to consider a more capable spacecraft. The [[Orbital Space Plane]] (OSP) development got underway in 2001, with an early version expected to enter service by 2010. With the initiation of the Constellation program in 2004, the knowledge gained on the OSP was transferred to Johnson Space Center (JSC) for use in the development of the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]]. No operational OSP was ever built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/background/facts/ospfacts.html "Beginning a New Era of Space Flight: The Orbital Space Plane"] MSFC Fact Sheet, May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====International Space Station====
The [[International Space Station]] is a partnership of the United States, Russian, European, Japanese, and Canadian Space Agencies. The station has continuously had human occupants since November 2, 2000. Orbiting 16 times daily at an average altitude of about {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=on}}, it passes over some 90 percent of the world's surface. It weighs over {{convert|800,000|lb|kg}}, and a crew of six conducts research and prepares the way for future explorations.

NASA began the plan to build a space station in 1984. The station was named ''Freedom'' in 1988, and changed to the International Space Station (ISS) in 1992. The ISS is composed in modules, and the assembly in orbit started with the delivery of Russian module [[Zarya (spacecraft)|''Zarya'']] in November 1998. This was followed in December by the first U.S. module, ''Unity'' also called Node 1, built by Boeing in facilities at MSFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/docs/ISS_overview.pdf|title=Boeing: International Space Station|author=|date=|website=www.boeing.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 21st century started, Space Shuttle flights carried up supplies and additional small equipment, including a portion of the solar power array. The two-module embryonic ISS remained unmanned until the next module, [[Destiny (ISS module)|''Destiny'']], the U.S. Laboratory, arrived on February 7, 2001; this module was also built by Boeing at MSFC. The three-module station allowed a minimum crew of two astronauts or cosmonauts to be on the ISS permanently. In July, [[Quest Joint Airlock|''Quest'']] air-lock was added to ''Unity'', providing the capability for [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA).

Since 1998, 18 major U.S. components on the ISS have been assembled in space. In October 2007, [[Harmony (ISS module)|''Harmony'']] or Node 2, was attached to ''Destiny''; also managed by MSFC, this gave connection hubs for European and Japanese modules as well as additional living space, allowing the ISS crew to increase to six. The 18th and final major U.S. and Boeing-built element, the Starboard 6 Truss Segment, was delivered to the ISS in February 2009. With this, the full set of solar arrays could be activated, increasing the power available for science projects to 30&amp;nbsp;kW. That marked the completion of the U.S. "core" of the station.

On 5 March 2010, Boeing turned over to NASA the U.S. on-orbit segment of the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boeing.mediaroom.com/2010-03-05-Boeing-Transfers-US-Portions-of-International-Space-Station-to-NASA|title=Boeing Transfers US Portions of International Space Station to NASA|last=|first=|date=5 March 2010|website=Boeing|publisher=Boeing|access-date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is planned that the International Space Station will be operated at least through the end of 2020. With the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2011, future manned missions to the ISS will depend upon the Russian ''Soyuz'' spacecraft for the immediate future.

====Advanced scientific research====
MSFC is involved in some of the most advanced space research of our time. Scientist/Astronaut researchers aboard the [[International Space Station]] are engaged in hundreds of advanced experiments, most of which could not be conducted except for the zero-gravity environment. The deep-space images from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] are made possible in part by the people and facilities at Marshall. The Center was not only responsible for the design, development, and construction of these telescopes, but it is also now home to the only facility in the world for testing large telescope mirrors in a space-simulated environment. Preliminary work has started on a Hubble successor, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST); this will be the largest primary mirror ever assembled in space. In the future, the facility will likely be used for another successor, the [[Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope]] (AT-LAST).

The [[National Space Science and Technology Center]] (NSSTC) is a joint research venture between NASA and the seven research universities of the State of Alabama. The primary purpose of NSSTC is to foster collaboration in research between government, academia, and industry. It consists of seven research centers: Advanced Optics, Biotechnology, Global Hydeology &amp; Climate, Information Technology, Material Science, Propulsion, and Space Science. Each center is managed by either MSFC, the host NASA facility, or the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]], the host university.

=====Deep-space astronomy=====
The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] was launched in April 1990, but gave flawed images. It had been designed at MSFC, but used a primary mirror that had [[spherical aberration]] due to incorrect grinding and polishing by the contractor. The defect was found when the telescope was in orbit. The design was such that repairs were possible, and three maintenance missions were flown in Shuttles during the 1990s. Another servicing mission (STS-109) was flown on March 1, 2002. Each mission resulted in considerable improvements, with the images receiving worldwide attention from astronomers as well as the public.

Based on the success of earlier maintenance missions, NASA decided to have a fifth service mission to Hubble; this was STS-125 flown on May 11, 2009. The maintenance and addition of equipment resulted in Hubble performance considerably better than planned at its origin. It is now expected that the Hubble will remain operational until its successor, the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST), is available in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/about.html|title=About Webb/NASA|author=|date=|website=www.jwst.nasa.gov|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts125/main/overview.html|title=NASA - STS-125: The Final Visit|first=Jerry Wright :|last=JSC|date=|website=www.nasa.gov|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Further information|#Hubble Space Telescope}}

The [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], originating at MSFC, was launched on July 3, 1999, and is operated by the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]]. With an [[angular resolution]] of 0.5 [[arcsecond]] (2.4 µrad), it has a thousand times better resolution than the first orbiting X-ray telescopes. Its highly [[eliptical]] orbit allows continuous observations up to 85 percent of its 65-hour [[orbital period]]. With its ability to make X-ray images of star clusters, supernova remnants, galactic eruptions, and collisions between clusters of galaxies - in its first decade of operation it has transformed astronomer's view of the high-energy universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/ten/|title=Chandra :: About Chandra :: The Extraordinary Universe with Chandra|author=|date=|website=chandra.harvard.edu|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]], initially called the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), is an international, multi-agency space observatory used to study the cosmos. It was launched June 11, 2008, has a design life of 5 years and a goal of 10 years. The primary instrument is the Large Area Telescope (LAT) that is sensitive in the photon energy range of 8 to greater than 300 GeV. It can view about 20% of the sky at any given moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/spacecraft/index.html "Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope"], NASA&lt;/ref&gt;

The LAT is complemented by the GLAST Burst Monitor (GBM) which can detect burst of X-rays and gamma rays in the 8-keV to 3-MeV energy range, overlapping with the LAT. The GBM is a collaborative effort between the U.S. [[National Space Science and Technology Center]] and the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]] in Germany. MSFC manages the GBM, and Charles A. Meegan of MSFC is the Principal Investigator. Many new discoveries have been made in the initial period of operation. For example, on May 10, 2009, a burst was detected that, by its propagation characteristics, is believed to negate some approaches to a new theory of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/first_year.html NASA - Fermi Telescope Caps First Year With Glimpse of Space-Time]. Nasa.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), with [[Gerald J. Fishman]] of MSFC serving as Principal Investigator, is an ongoing examination of the many years of data from gamma-ray bursts, pulsars, and other transient gamma-ray phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;"The Gamma-Ray Astronomy Team Home Page; {{cite web |url=http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108070046/http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/ |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 [[Shaw Prize]], often called "Asia's Nobel Prize," was shared by Fishman and Italian astronomer [[Enrico Costa (physicist)|Enrico Costa]] for their gamma-ray research.&lt;ref&gt;Roop, Lee; "Gamma rays lead to glory," ''The Huntsville Times'', June 16, 2011, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Research in the ISS=====
For 10 years, MSFC has supported activities in the U.S. Laboratory (''Destiny'') and elsewhere on the International Space Station through the [[Payload Operations and Integration Center|Payload Operations Center]] (POC). The research activities include experiments on topics ranging from human physiology to physical science. Operating around the clock, scientists, engineers, and flight controllers in the POC link Earth-bound researchers throughout the world with their experiments and astronauts aboard the ISS. {{As of|2011|03}}, this has included the coordination of more than 1,100 experiments conducted by 41 space-station crew members involved in over 6,000 hours of science research.

=====Solar system research=====
Teams at Marshall manage NASA's programs for exploring the Sun, the Moon, the planets, and other bodies throughout our solar system. These have included [[Gravity Probe B]], an experiment to test two predictions of Einstein's general theory of relativity, and [[Hinode|Solar-B]], an international mission to study the solar magnetic field and origins of the solar wind, a phenomenon that affects radio transmission on the Earth. The MSFC Lunar Precursor and Robotic Program Office manages projects and directs studies on lunar robotic activities across NASA.

=====Climate and weather research=====
MSFC also develops systems for monitoring the Earth's climate and weather patterns. At the Global Hydrology and Climate Center (GHCC), researchers combine data from Earth systems with satellite data to monitor biodiversity conservation and climate change, providing information that improves agriculture, urban planning, and water-resource management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/ GHCC / Earth Science Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224052901/http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/ |date=2011-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Microsatellites=====
On November 19, 2010, MSFC entered the new field of microsatellites with the successful launch of  [[FASTSAT]]  (Fast, Affordable, Science and Technology Satellite). Part of a joint DoD/NASA payload, it was launched by a [[Minotaur IV]] rocket from the [[Kodiak Launch Complex]] on [[Kodiak Island]], Alaska. FASTSAT is a platform carrying multiple small payloads to low-Earth orbit, creating opportunities to conduct low-cost scientific and technology research on an autonomous satellite in space. FASTSAT, weighing just under {{convert|400|lb|kg}}, serves as a full scientific laboratory containing all the resources needed to carry out scientific and technology research operations. It was developed at the MSFC in partnership with the Von Braun Center for Science &amp; Innovation and Dynetics, Inc., both of Huntsville, Alabama. Mark Boudreaux is the project manager for MSFC.

There are six experiments on the FASTSAT bus, including [[NanoSail-D2]], which is itself a nanosatellite – the first satellite launched from another satellite. It was deployed satisfactorily on January 21, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/smallsats/fastsat/ "FASTSAT Latest News and Update"] MSFC Data&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spinoffs====
In addition to supporting NASA's key missions, the spinoffs from these activities at MSFC have contributed broadly to technologies that improve the Nation and the World. In the last decade alone, Marshall generated more than 60 technologies featured as NASA spinoffs. MSFC research has benefited firefighters, farmers, plumbers, healthcare providers, soldiers, teachers, pilots, divers, welders, architects, photographers, city planners, disaster relief workers, criminal investigators, and even video-gamers and golfers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/ "Value for NASA, Benefits for the Nation]" Office of the Chief Technologist, NASA&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 1990s – the Shuttle era===
The [[Space Shuttle]] is likely the most complex spacecraft ever built. Although MSFC was not responsible for developing the centerpiece – the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|Orbiter Vehicle]] (OV) – it was responsible for all of the rocket propulsion elements: the OV's three main engines, the [[Space Shuttle external tank|External Tank]] (ET), and the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|Solid-Rocket Boosters]] (SRBs). MSFC was also responsible for [[Spacelab]], the research facility carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay on certain flights. From the start of the program in 1972, the management and development of Space Shuttle propulsion was a major activity at MSFC. [[Alex McCool|Alex A. McCool, Jr.]] was manager of MSFC's Space Shuttle Projects Office.

====Shuttle propulsion====
Throughout 1980, engineers at MSFC participated in tests related to plans to launch the first Space Shuttle. During these early tests and prior to each later Shuttle launch, personnel in the Huntsville Operations Support Center monitored consoles to evaluate and help solve any problems at the Florida launch that might involve Shuttle propulsion

On April 12, 1981, [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] made the first orbital test flight of a full Space Shuttle with two astronauts. This was designated [[STS-1]] (Space Transportation System-1), and verified the combined performance of the entire system. This was followed by [[STS-2]] on November 12, also using ''Columbia'', primarily to demonstrate safe re-launch of a Shuttle. During 1982, two more test flights ([[STS-3]] &amp; [[STS-4]]) were made. [[STS-5]], launched November 11, was the first operational mission; carrying four astronauts, two commercial satellite were deployed. In all three of these flights, on-board experiments were carried and conducted on pallets in the Shuttle's cargo bay.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of space shuttle missions]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Space Shuttle [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']] was launched on mission [[STS-51-L]] on January 28, 1986. (The sequential numbering changed after 1983, but otherwise this would have been STS-25). One-minute, 13-seconds into flight, the entire ''Challenger'' was [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|enveloped in a fireball and broke into several large segments, killing the seven astronauts]]. Subsequent analysis of the high-speed tracking films and telemetry signals indicated that a leak occurred in a joint on one of the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters (SRBs)]], the escaping flame impinged on the surface of the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank (ET)]]; there followed a complex series of very rapid structural failures, and in milliseconds the hydrogen and oxygen streaming from the ruptured tank exploded.

The basic cause of the disaster was determined to be an [[O-ring]] failure in the right SRB; cold weather was a contributing factor. The redesign effort, directed by MSFC, involved an extensive test program to verify that the SRBs were safe. There were no Space Shuttle missions in the remainder of 1986 or in 1987. Flights resumed in September 1988, with sequential numbering starting with [[STS-26]].

====Shuttle missions and payloads====
As a reusable space-launch vehicle, the space shuttles carried a wide variety of payloads – from scientific research equipment to highly classified military satellites. The flights were assigned a Space Transportation System (STS) number, in general sequenced by the planned launch date. The Wikipedia [[list of space shuttle missions]] shows all flights, their missions, and other information.

The first orbital flight (STS-1) by Shuttle ''Columbia'' on April 12, 1981, did not have a payload, but all flights that followed generally had multiple payloads. Through 1989, there were 32 flights; this includes the one on January 28, 1986, when ''Challenger'' was lost, and the delay until September 29, 1988, when flights resumed. During the 1990s, there were 58 flights, giving a total of 95 successful flights through 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/missions.html Space Shuttle Launch Archive]. Science.ksc.nasa.gov (2003-02-01). Retrieved on 2013-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]] planetary spacecraft, MSFC managed the adaptation of the [[Inertial Upper Stage]]. This solid-rocket was used in May 1989 to propel the spacecraft from Orbiter ''Atlantis'' on a 15-month loop around the Sun and eventually into orbit around Venus for four years of radar surface-mapping.

Many Shuttle flights carried equipment for performing on-board research. Such equipment was accommodated in two forms: on pallets or other arrangements in the Shuttle's cargo bay (most often in addition to hardware for the primary mission), or within a reusable laboratory called Skylab. All such experimental payloads were under the general responsibility of MSFC.

=====Pallet experiments=====
Pallet experiments covered a very wide spread of types and complexity, but many of them were in fluid physics, materials science, biotechnology, combustion science, and commercial space processing. For some missions, an aluminum bridge fitting across the cargo bay was used. This could carry 12 standard canisters holding isolated experiments, particularly those under the [[Getaway Special]] (GAS) program. GAS flights were made available at low cost to colleges and universities, American industries, individuals, foreign governments, and others.

On some flights, a variety of pallet experiments constituted the full payload; examples of these include the following:

*[[STS-35|Astronomy Laboratory-1]] (ASTRO-1) was developed by Goddard Space Flight Center and flown on STS-35 in December 1990. The $150-million payload included an X-ray telescope and three ultraviolet (UV) telescopes. The displays to be used by the on-board scientist-astronaut to aim the UV telescopes failed. An astronomer in the MSFC Payload Control Center then did the telescope pointing.
*[[STS-45|Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science]] (ATLAS 1) was carried on STS-45 launched in March 1992. This had l2 instruments from the U.S., France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and Japan. Experiments were conducted in atmospheric chemistry, solar radiation, space plasma physics, and ultraviolet astronomy.

=====Spacelab=====
In addition to the pallet experiments, many other experiments were flown and performed using [[Spacelab]]. This was a reusable laboratory consisting of multiple components, including a pressurized module, an unpressurized carrier, and other related hardware. Under a program managed by MSFC, ten Europeans nations jointly designed, built, and financed the first Spacelab through the European Space Research Organisation ([[ESRO]]. In addition, Japan funded a Spacelab for STS-47, a dedicated mission.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Douglas R.; [https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19880009991 "Spacelab: An international success story"] NASA, Jan. 1, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a 15-year period, Spacelab components flew on 22 shuttle missions, the last in April 1998. Examples of Spacelab missions follow:

*[[STS-9|Spacelab 1]] was flown on STS-9, launched November 28, 1983. A Shuttle ''Columbia'' flight, this was the first with six astronauts, including two Payload Specialists from the ESRO. There were 73 experiments carried out in astronomy and physics, atmospheric physics, Earth observations, life sciences, materials sciences, and space plasma physics
*[[STS-50|U.S. Microgravity Laboratory 1]] (USML-1) was launched in June 1992 on STS-50, the first [[Extended Duration Orbiter]]. During 14 days, 31 microgravity experiments were completed in round-the-clock operations. [[STS-73|USML-2]] was launched in October 1995 on STS-73 with an MSFC scientist, [[Frederick W. Leslie]], as an on-board Payload Specialist.

In early 1990, MSFC's new Spacelab Mission Operations Control Center took over the responsibility for controlling all Spacelab missions. This replaced the Payload Operations Control Center formerly situated at the JSC from which previous Spacelab missions were operated.&lt;ref&gt;"Spacelab Mission Operations Control Facility," MSFC Fact Sheet, May 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other major programs====
The advent of the Space Shuttle made possible several major space programs in which MSFC had significant responsibilities. These were the International Space Station, the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, and the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. The latter three are part of NASA's series of  [[Great Observatories program|Great Observatories]]; this series also includes the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], but this was not launched by a Space Shuttle and MSFC had no significant role in its development.

=====International Space Station=====
A manned space station had long been in the plans of visionaries. Wernhar von Braun, in his widely read ''Collier's Magazine'' 1953 article, envisioned this to be a huge wheel, rotating to produce gravity-like forces on the occupants.&lt;ref&gt;''Opt.Cet.''; Wernher von Braun; "Crossing the Last Frontier,"&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Project Horizon]], prepared by the U.S. Army in 1959, a space station would be built by assembling spent booster rockets. Following this same basic concept, in 1973 MSFC used a modified stage of Saturn V to put into orbit [[Skylab]], but this was preceded by the Soviet Union's ''[[Salyut]]'' in 1971, then followed by their ''[[Mir]]'' in 1986. Even during Skylab, MSFC began plans for a much more complete space station. President [[Ronald Reagan]] announced plans to build [[Space Station Freedom]] in 1984. Luther B. Powell was MSFC's space station program manager.

By the late 1990s, planning for four different stations were underway: the American ''Freedom'', the Soviet/Russian ''[[Mir-2]]'', the European ''Columbus'', and the Japanese ''[[Japanese Experimental Module|Kibō]]''. In June 1992, with the [[Cold War]] over, American President [[George H. W. Bush]] and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] agreed to cooperate on space exploration. Then in September 1993, American Vice-President [[Al Gore, Jr.]], and Russian Prime Minister [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]] announced plans for a new space station. In November, plans for ''Freedom'', ''Mir-2'', and the European and Japanese modules were incorporated into a single [[International Space Station]]. Boeing began as NASA's prime contractor for U.S. hardware in January 1995.

The ISS is composed of a number of modules, sharing primary power from large arrays of solar power cells. The first module, ''[[Zarya]]'' from Russia, was delivered to orbit by a [[Proton rocket]] on November 20, 1998. On December 4, the first American component,  [[Unity (ISS module)|''Unity'']], a connecting module, was carried up by Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'' on flight STS-88; it was then joined with ''Zarya'' to form an embrionic ISS.  ''Unity'' was built by Boeing in MSFC facilities. Additional building supplies were carried to the ISS in May 1999, aboard STS-96.

The ISS continued to be assembled throughout the next decade, and has been continuously occupied since February 7, 2001. In March 2010, Boeing completed its contract and officially turned over to NASA the U.S. on-orbit segment of the ISS.

=====Hubble Space Telescope=====
Shortly after NASA was formed, the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] was launched, and was followed by the [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory]] (OAO) that carried out ultraviolet observations of stars between 1968 and 1972. These showed the value of space-based astronomy, and led to the planning of the Large Space Telescope (LST) that would be launched and maintained from the forthcoming space shuttle. Budget limitations almost killed the LST, but the astronomy community – especially [[Lyman Spitzer]] – and the National Science Foundation pressed for a major program in this area. Congress finally funded LST in 1978, with an intended launch date of 1983.

MSFC was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GFC) was to control the scientific instrument and the ground-control center. As the Project Scientist, MSFC brought on board C. Robert O’Dell, then chairman of the Astronomy Department at the [[University of Chicago]]. Several different people, at various times, served as the project manager. The telescope assembly was designed as a [[Cassegrain reflector]] with hyperbolic mirror polished to be [[diffraction limited]]; the primary mirror had a diameter of {{convert|2.4|m|in|abbr=on}}. The mirrors were developed by the optics firm, Perkin-Elmer. MSFC did not have a facility to check the ‘end-to-end’ performance of the mirror assembly, so the telescope could not be totally checked until launched and placed in service.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Robert; ''The Universe in a Mirror: The Saga of the Hubble Space Telescope and Visionaries Who Built It''; Princeton Univ. Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The LST was named the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in 1983, the original launch date. There were many problems, delays, and cost increases in the program, and the ''Challenger'' disaster delayed the availability of the launch vehicle. Finally, on April 24, 1990, on Mission STS-31, Shuttle ''Discovery'' launched the Hubble telescope successfully into its planned orbit. Almost immediately it was realized that the optical performance was not as expected; analysis of the flawed images showed that the primary mirror had been ground to the wrong shape, resulting in [[spherical aberration]].

Fortunately, the Hubble telescope had been designed to allow in-space maintenance, and in December 1993, mission STS-61 carried astronauts to the Hubble to make corrections and change some components. A second repair mission, STS-82, was made in February 1997, and a third, STS-103, in December 1999. For these repair missions, the astronauts practiced the work in MSFC's Neutral Buoyancy Facility, simulating the weightless environment of space.

Through the 1990s, the Hubble did provide astronomy images that had never before been seen. During the next decade, two additional repair missions were made (March 2002 and in May 2009), eventually bringing the telescope to even better that its initially intended performance.

=====Chandra X-Ray Observatory=====
Even before HEAO-2 (the [[Einstein Observatory]]) was launched in 1978, MSFC began preliminary studies for a larger X-ray telescope. To support this effort, in 1976 an X-Ray Test Facility, the only one of its size, was constructed at Marshall for verification testing and calibration of X-ray mirrors, telescope systems, and instruments. With the success of HEAO-2, MSFC was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of what was then known as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF). The [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (SAO) partners with MSFC, providing the science and operational management.

Work on the AXAF continued through the 1980s. A major review was held in 1992, resulting in many changes; four of the twelve planned mirrors were eliminated, as were two of the six scientific instruments. The planned circular orbit was changed to an elliptical one, reaching one-third of the way to the Moon at its farthest point; this eliminated the possibility of improvement or repair using the Space Shuttle, but it placed the spacecraft above the Earth's radiation belts for most of its orbit.

AXAF was renamed [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] in 1998. It was launched July 23, 1999, by the Shuttle ''Columbia'' (STS-93). An [[Inertial Upper Stage]] booster adapted by MSFC was used to transport ''Chandra'' to its high orbit Weighing about {{convert|22,700|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, this was the heaviest payload ever launched by a Shuttle. Operationally managed by the SAO, ‘’Chandra’’ has been returning excellent data since being activated. It initially had an expected life of five years, but this has now been extended to 15 years or longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/main/index.html "Chandra: Exploring the Invisible Universe"] MSFC&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Compton Gamma Ray Observatory=====
The ''Compton'' Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) is another of NASA's Great Observatories; it was launched April 5, 1991, on Shuttle flight STS-37. At {{convert|37,000|lb|kg}}, it was the heaviest astrophysical payload ever flown at that time. CGRO was 14 years in development by NASA; TRW was the builder. Gamma radiation (rays) is the highest energy-level of electromagnetic radiation, having energies above 100 [[electronvolt|keV]] and thus frequencies above 10 [[hertz|exahertz]] (10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; Hz). This is produced by [[atom|sub-atomic]] particle interactions, including those in certain astrophysical processes. The continuous flow of cosmic rays bombarding space objects, such as the Moon, generate this radiation Gamma rays also result in bursts from nuclear reactions. The CGRO was designed to image continuous radiation and to detect bursts.

MSFC was responsible for the Burst and Transient Source Experiment, (BATSE). This triggered on sudden changes in gamma count-rates lasting 0.1 to 100 s; it was also capable of detecting less impulsive sources by measuring their modulation using the Earth [[occultation]] technique. In nine years of operation, BATSE triggered about 8000 events, of which some 2700 were strong bursts that were analyzed to have come from distant galaxies.

Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, the CGRO was not designed for on-orbit repair and refurbishment. Thus, after one of its gyroscopes failed, NASA decided that a controlled crash was preferable to letting the craft come down on its own at random. On June 4, 2000, it was intentionally de-orbited, with the debris that did not burn up falling harmlessly into the Pacific Ocean. At MSFC, [[Gerald J. Fishman]] is the principal investigator of a project to continue examination of data from BATSE and other gamma-ray projects. The 2011 [[Shaw Prize]] was shared by Fishman and Italian [[Enrico Costa (physicist)|Enrico Costa]] for their gamma-ray research.

===1960s and 1970s – the initial decades===
[[File:MSFC rocket park.jpg|thumb|Rockets developed at MSFC and ABMA before it are on display at MSFC.]]
Shortly before activating its new Field Center in July 1960, NASA described the MSFC as the only self-contained organization in the nation that was capable of conducting the development of a space vehicle from the conception of the idea, through production of hardware, testing, and launching operations.

Initially, engineers from Huntsville traveled to Florida to conduct launch activities at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]]. The first NASA launch facility there ([[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39]]) was designed and operated by MSFC, then in on July 1, 1962, the overall site achieving equal status with other NASA centers and was named the Launch Operations Center, later renamed the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC).

Another major NASA facility, the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) located near [[Houston, Texas]], was officially opened in September 1963. Designated the primary center for U.S. space missions and systems involving astronauts, it coordinates and monitors crewed missions through the Mission Control Center. MSC was renamed the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) in February 1973. Through the years, there have been a number of ‘turf’ battles between MSFC and MSC/JSC concerning mission responsibilities.

When the Marshall Space Flight Center began official operations in July 1960, Wernher von Braun was the Director and Eberhard Rees was his Deputy for Research and Development. The administrative activities in MSFC were led by persons with backgrounds in traditional U.S. Government functions, but all of the technical heads were individuals who had assisted von Braun in his success at ABMA. The initial technical activities and leaders at MSFC were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;From a NASA-MSFC Organization Chart dated May 25, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}
* Director – [[Wernher von Braun]]
* Deputy Director for R&amp;D – [[Eberhard Rees|Eberhard F. M. Rees]]
* Reliability Office – H. August Schulze
* Future Projects Office – [[Heinz-Hermann Koelle]]
* Light &amp; Medium Vehicles Office – Hans Hueter
* Saturn Systems Office – O. Hermann Lange
* Technical Program Coordination Office – George N. Constan
* Weapons Systems Office – Werner G. Tiller
* Launch Operations Directorate – [[Kurt H. Debus]]
* Aeroballistics Division – [[Ernst Geissler|Ernst G. Geissler]]
* Computation Division – [[Helmut Hölzer]]
* Fabrication &amp; Assembly Engineering Division – Hans H. Maus
* Guidance &amp; Control Division – [[Walter Haeussermann|Walter Häussermann]]
* Quality Division – [[Dieter Grau|Dieter E. Grau]]
* Research Projects Division – [[Ernst Stuhlinger]]
* Structures &amp; Mechanics Division – [[William A. Mrazek]]
* Test Division – Karl L. Heimburg
{{div col end}}

With the exception of Koelle, all of the technical leaders had come to the United States under [[Operation Paperclip]] after working together at [[Peenemünde]]. Von Braun knew well the capabilities of these individuals and had great confidence in them. This confidence was shown to be appropriate; in the following decade of developing hardware and technical operations that established new levels of complexity, there was never a single failure of their designs during manned flight.

The initial projects at MSFC were primarily continuations of work initiated earlier at ABMA. Of immediate importance was the final preparation of a Redstone rocket that, under [[Project Mercury]] would lift a [[space capsule]] carrying the first American into space. Originally scheduled to take place in October 1960, this was postponed several time and on May 5, 1961, [[astronaut]] [[Alan Shepard]] made America's first [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]. The delays led to a circumstance similar to that of the first satellite; on April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]] had become the first person to orbit the Earth.

By 1965, MSFC had about 7,500 government employees. In addition, most of the prime contractors for launch vehicles and related major items (including [[North American Aviation]], [[Chrysler]], [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft]], [[Rocketdyne]], and [[IBM]]) collectively had approximately a similar number of employees working in MSFC facilities.

Several support contracting firms were also involved in the programs; the largest of these was Brown Engineering Company (BECO, later [[Teledyne Technologies#Companies|Teledyne Brown Engineering]]), the first high-technology firm in Huntsville and by this time having some 3,500 employees. In the Saturn-Apollo activities, BECO/TBE provided about 20-million [[man-hour]]s of support. Milton K. Cummings was the BECO president, Joseph C. Moquin the executive vice president, William A. Girdini led the engineering design and test work, and Raymond C. Watson, Jr., directed the research and advanced systems activities. [[Cummings Research Park]], the second largest park of this type in the Nation, was named for Cummings in 1973.

====Saturn launch vehicles====
On May 25, 1961, just 20 days after Shepard's flight, President [[John F. Kennedy]] committed the Nation to "achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth".&lt;ref&gt;John F. Kennedy; "Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs." Delivered in person before a joint session of Congress, May 25, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In what would be called the [[Apollo Program]], the primary mission of MSFC was developing the heavy-lift rockets – the Saturn family. This required the development and equalization of three new liquid-fueled rocket engines, the  [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]], the [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]], and the [[H-1 (rocket engine)]]; in addition, an existing engine, the [[RL10]], was improved for use on Saturns. Leland F. Belew managed the Engine Development Office.&lt;ref&gt;Bilstein, Roger E.; [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/sp4206.htm "Stages to Saturn: A Technological History of the Apollo/Saturn Launch Vehicles]" NASA History Series;&lt;/ref&gt;
The F-1 engine was, and still is the most powerful single-nozzle liquid-fueled rocket engine ever used in service; each produced 1.5-million-pounds thrust. Originally started by the U.S. Air Force, responsibility for the development was taken over by ABMA in 1959, and the first test firings at MSFC were in December 1963.

=====Saturn I=====
The original vehicle, designated [[Saturn I]], consisted of two propulsion stages and an instrument unit; it was first tested in flight on October 27, 1961. The first stage (S-I) had a cluster of eight H-1 engines, giving approximately 1.5-million-pounds thrust total. The four outboard engines were [[gimbaled thrust|gimbaled]] to allow vehicle steering. The second stage (SIV) had six gimbaled LR10A-3 engines, producing a combined 90-thousand-pounds thrust. Ten Saturn Is were used in flight-testing of Apollo [[boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] units. Five of the test flights also carried important auxiliary scientific experiments.

=====Saturn IB=====
The [[Saturn IB]] (alternatively known as the Uprated Saturn I) also had two propulsion stages and an instrument unit. The first stage (S-IB) also had eight H-1 engines with four gimballed, but the stage had eight fixed fins of equal size fitted to the sides to provide aerodynamic stability. The second stage (S-IVB) had a single J-2 engine that gave a more powerful 230-thousand-pounds thrust. The J-2 was gimbaled and could also be restarted during flight. The vehicle was first flight-tested on February 26, 1966. Fourteen Saturn 1Bs (or partial vehicles) were built, with five used in unmanned testing and five others used in manned missions, the last on July 15, 1975.

=====Saturn V=====
The [[Saturn V]] was the pinnacle of developments at MSFC. This was an [[expendable launch system|expendable]], [[Human-rating certification|man-rated]] heavy-lift vehicle that was the most vital element in the Apollo Program. Designed under the direction of [[Arthur Rudolph]], the Saturn V holds the record as the largest and most powerful launch vehicle ever brought to operational status from a combined height, weight, and payload standpoint.

The Saturn V consisted of three propulsion stages and an instrument unit. The first stage (S-IC), had five F-1 engines, giving a combined total of 7.5-million-pounds thrust. These engines were arranged in a cross pattern, with the center engine fixed and the outer four gimballed. The second stage (S-II), had five J-2 engines with the same arrangement as the F-1s and giving a total of 1.0-million-pounds thrust. The third stage (S-IVB) had a single gimballed J-2 engine with 200-thousand-pounds thrust. As previously noted, the J-2 engine could be restarted in flight. The basic configuration for this heavy-lift vehicle was selected in early 1963, and the name Saturn V was applied at that time (configurations that might have led to Saturn II, III, and IV were discarded).

The [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo Spacecraft]] was atop the launch vehicle, and was composed of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) and the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) inside the Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter, with the [[Launch Escape System]] at the very top. The Apollo Spacecraft and its components were developed by other NASA centers, but were flight-tested on Saturn I and IB vehicles from MSFC.

While the three propulsion stages were the "muscle" of the Saturn V, the [[Saturn V Instrument Unit|Instrument Unit]] (IU) was the "brains." The IU was on a 260-inch (6.6-m) diameter, 36-inch (91-cm) high, ring that was held between the third propulsion stage and the LM. It contained the basic guidance system components – a stable platform, accelerometers, a digital computer, and control electronics – as well as radar, telemetry, and other units. Basically the same IU configuration was used on the Saturn I and IB. With IBM as the prime contractor, the IU was the only full Saturn component manufactured in Huntsville.

The first Saturn V test flight was made on November 9, 1967. On July 16, 1969, as its crowning achievement in the Apollo space program, a Saturn V vehicle lifted the Apollo 11 spacecraft and three astronauts on their journey to the Moon. Other Apollo launches continued through December 6, 1972. The last Saturn V flight was on May 14, 1973, in the Skylab Program (described later). A total of 15 Saturn Vs were built; 13 functioned flawlessly, and the other two (intended as backup) remain unused.

=====Fabrication and test facilities=====
Wernher von Braun believed that the personnel designing the space vehicles should have direct, hands-on participation in the building and testing of the hardware. For this, MSFC had facilities comparable with the best to be found in private industries. Included were precision machine shops, giant metal-forming and welding machines, and all types of inspection equipment. For every type of Saturn vehicle, one or more prototypes were fabricated in MSFC shops. Large, special-purpose computers were used in the checkout procedures.

Static test towers had been constructed at ABMA for the Redstone and Jupiter rockets. In 1961, the Jupiter stand was modified to test Saturn 1 and 1B stages. A number of other test stands followed, the largest being the [[Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand]] completed in 1964. At {{convert|475|ft|m}} in height, the entire Saturn V could be accommodated. Also completed in 1964, the S1C Static Test Stand was for live firing of the five F-1 engines of the first stage. Delivering a total of 7.5-million-pounds thrust, the tests produced earthquake-like rumbles throughout the Huntsville area and could be heard as far as {{convert|100|mi|km}} away.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Pamphlet, "Propulsion Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center" 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Saturn activities progressed, external facilities were needed. In 1961, The Michoud Rocket Factory near New Orleans, Louisiana, was selected as the Saturn production site. A {{convert|13,500|acre|km2}} isolated area in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] was selected to conduct Saturn tests. Known as the Mississippi Test Facility (later renamed the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]]), this was primarily to test the vehicles built at the [[Michoud Assembly Facility|rocket factory]].

====Space Shuttle====
[[File:Space Shuttle Pathfinder OV-098 original configuration.jpg|thumb|A crane hoists [[Space Shuttle Pathfinder]] into the Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand at MSFC to test the procedures in preparation for the dynamic test of [[Space Shuttle Enterprise]].]]
On January 5, 1972, President [[Richard M. Nixon]] announced plans to develop the [[Space Shuttle]], a reusable Space Transportation System (STS) for routine access to space. The Shuttle was composed of the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|Orbiter Vehicle]] (OV) containing the crew and payload, two [[Solid Rocket Booster]]s (SRBs), and the [[Space Shuttle external tank|External Tank]] (ET) that carried liquid fuel for the OV's main engines. MSFC was responsible for the SRBs, the OV's three main engines, and the ET. The Center also received responsibility for [[Spacelab]], a versatile laboratory that would be carried on some flights within the Shuttle's cargo bay. Other assignments included the adaptation of the [[Inertial Upper Stage]] Booster, a two-stage rocket that would lift Shuttle payloads into higher orbits or interplanetary voyages.

The first test firing of an OV main engine was in 1975. Two years later, the first firing of a SRB took place and tests on the ET began at MSFC. The first ''Enterprise'' OV flight, attached to a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA – an extensively modified [[Boeing 747]]), was in February 1977; this as followed by a free landings in August and October. In March 1978, the ''Enterprise'' OV was flown atop a SCA to MSFC. Mated to an ET, the partial Space Shuttle was hoisted onto the modified [[Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand]] where it was subjected to a full range of vibrations comparable to those in a launch. The second space shuttle, ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', was completed and placed at the KSC for checking and launch preparation. On April 12, 1981, the ''Columbia'' made the first orbital test flight.

====Scientific and engineering research====
From the start, MSFC has had strong research projects in science and engineering. Two of the early activities, Highwater and Pegasus, were performed on a non-interference basis while testing the Saturn I vehicle.

=====Highwater and Pegasus=====
In [[Project Highwater]], the dummy second stage was filled with {{convert|23,000|USgal|m3}} of water as ballast, and, after burnout of the first stage, explosive charges released the water into the upper atmosphere. The project answered questions about the diffusion of liquid propellants in the event that a rocket was destroyed at high altitude. Highwater experiments were carried out in April and November,1962.

Under the [[Pegasus satellite program|Pegasus Satellite Program]], the second stage was instrumented to study the frequency and penetration depth of [[micrometeoroid]]s. Two large panels were folded into the empty stage and, when in orbit, unfolded to present 2,300-square-feet (210-m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of instrumented surface. Three Pegasus satellites were launched during 1965, and stayed in orbit from 3 to 13 years.

=====Lunar exploration=====
[[File:Lunar Roving Vehicle Mobility Test Article Dress Test.jpg|thumb|MSFC tested candidates for the Lunar Roving Vehicle on this test track.]]
The overall Apollo Program was the largest scientific and engineering research activity in history. The actual landing on the Moon led to investigations that could have only been conducted on location. There were six Apollo missions that landed on the Moon: [[Apollo 11]], [[Apollo 12|12]], [[Apollo 14|14]], [[Apollo 15|15]], [[Apollo 16|16]], and [[Apollo 17|17]]. [[Apollo 13]] had been intended as a landing, but only circled the Moon and returned to Earth after an oxygen tank ruptured and crippled power in the CSM.

Except for Apollo 11, all of the missions carried an [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP), composed of equipment for seven scientific experiments plus a central control station (they were controlled from the Earth) with a [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG). Scientists from MSFC were among the co-investigators.

The [[Lunar rover (Apollo)|Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV), popularly known as the "Moon Buggy," was developed by MSFC to provide transportation for exploring a limited amount of the Moon's surface. Not intended in the original planning, by 1969 it became clear that an LRV would be needed to maximize the scientific returns. An LRV was carried on the last three missions, allowing an area similar in size of Manhattan Island to be explored. Outbound they carried an ALSEP to be set up; on the return trip, they carried more than 200 pounds of lunar rock and soil samples. Saverio E. "Sonny" Morea was the LRV project manager at MSFC.&lt;ref&gt;Morea, Saverio E; [http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/lunar/LRV_Historical_Perspective.pdf "The Lunar Roving Vehicle – Historical Perspective"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Skylab and ATM=====
[[File:Serpentuator.jpg|thumb|MSFC engineers tested this articulated arm developed, but not used, for Skylab at a MSFC flat floor facility.]]
Even before the first Apollo landing, plans were being made by NASA for an [[Apollo Applications Program]] (AAP). This involved science-based manned space missions using surplus Apollo equipment. The lack of interest by Congress, and subsequent lack of funding, cut out most of the proposed activities – such as [[Manned Venus Flyby]] – but an orbital workshop remained of interest. Under [[Project Horizon]] in the late 1950s, use of spent missile stages for building a manned orbital space station had been proposed, and this general concept was picked up under AAP.

In December 1965, MSFC was authorized to have the Orbital Workshop as a formal project. At a meeting at MSFC on August 19, 1966, [[George Mueller (NASA)|George E. Mueller]], NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, pinned down the final concept for the major elements. MSFC was assigned responsibility for the development of the orbiting space station hardware as well as overall systems engineering and integration.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force was pursuing the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL), a small space station with a two-man crew, primarily intended for photo reconnaissance. For five years, MOL competed with a NASA station for funding but was finally dropped.
[[File:Neutral Buoyancy Space Simulator.jpg|thumb|MSFC used the Neutral Buoyancy Facility to test Skylab procedures. Here, engineers are testing procedures for repairing Skylab.]]
For testing and mission simulation, a {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=on}}-diameter water-filled tank, the [[Neutral Buoyancy Simulator|Neutral Buoyancy Facility]], was opened at MSFC in March 1968. Engineers and astronauts used this underwater facility to simulate the [[weightlessness]] (or zero-g) environment of space. This was particularly used in training astronauts in activities in zero-g work, especially [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalks]].

The Orbital Workshop was designed using the hull of a Saturn V third stage, being fully refitted on the ground. It was renamed [[Skylab]] in February 1970. Two were built – one for flight and the other for testing and mission simulation in the Neutral Buoyancy Facility. Leland F Belew served for eight years as the overall Skylab program director.

Another AAP project that survived was a solar observatory, originally intended to be a deployable attachment to the Apollo spacecraft. Called the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] (ATM), the project was assigned to MSFC in 1966. As the Orbital Workshop matured into the Skylab, the ATM was added as an appendage, but the two activities were kept as independent development projects. Rein Ise was the ATM project manager at MSFC. The ATM included eight major instruments for observations of the Sun at wavelengths from extreme [[ultraviolet]] to [[infrared]]. The data was mainly collected on special photographic film; during the Skylab missions, the film had to be changed out by astronauts in [[spacewalk]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ise, Rein, and Eugene H. Cagle; "The Apollo Telescope Mount on Skylab," ''Acta Astronautica'', vol. 1, no. 11–12 (Nov–Dec) 1974, pp 1315–1329&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 1973, the 77-ton (70,000-kg) Skylab was launched into a 235-nautical-mile (435-km) orbit by a Saturn V vehicle (the last to be flown) with Skylab replacing the upper stage. Saturn IB vehicles with their CSMs were used to ferry three-man crews to where they docked with the Skylab. Severe damage was sustained during Skylab launch and deployment, resulting in the loss of the station's micrometeoroid shield/sun shade and one of its main solar panels. This loss was partially corrected by the first crew, launched May 25; they stayed in orbit with Skylab for 28 days. Two additional missions followed with the launch dates of July 28 and November 16, with mission durations of 59 and 84 days, respectively. Skylab, including the ATM, logged about 2,000 hours on some 300 scientific and medical experiments. The last Skylab crew returned to the Earth on February 8, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Belew, Leland. F. (editor); [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-400/contents.htm "Skylab, Our First Space Station"] NASA publication SP-400, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Apollo–Soyuz=====
The last Saturn IB flight was launched on July 15, 1975, carrying a three-man crew on a six-day mission to dock with a Soviet [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft.. Called the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] (ASTP), the primary purpose was to provide engineering experience for future joint space flights, but both spacecraft also had scientific experiments. This was the last manned U.S. space mission until April 1981.

=====HEAO=====
The [[HEAO Program|High Energy Astronomy Observatory]] (HEAO) Program involved three missions of large spacecraft in [[low earth orbit|low-Earth orbit]] Each spacecraft was about {{convert|18|ft|m}} in length, weighed between {{convert|6000|and|7000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, and carried some {{convert|3000|lb|kg}} of experiments for [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] and [[gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray]] astronomy and [[Cosmic ray|cosmic-ray]] investigations. The project provided revolutionary insights into celestial objects by studying their high-energy radiation from space. Scientists from across the Nation served as [[principal investigator]]s.

The HEAO spacecraft was conceived by MSFC in the late 1960s, but, with the Apollo Program, funding did not become available for some time. Using [[Atlas-Centaur]] launch vehicles, highly successful missions were started in August 1977 (HEAO 1), November 1978 (HEAO 2, also called the Einstein Observatory), and September 1979 (HEAO 3). Fred A. Speer was the HEAO project manager for MSFC.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Wallace H.; [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-466/sp466.htm "The Star Splitters: The High Energy Astronomy Observatories"] NASA, SP-466, 1984;&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Other research=====
Other MSFC-managed space science projects in the 1970s included the [[LAGEOS|Laser Geodynamics Satellite]] (LAGEOS) and [[Gravity Probe A]]. In LAGEOS, laser beams from 35 ground stations are reflected by 422 prismatic mirrors on the satellite to track movements in the Earth's crust. The measurement accuracy is a few centimeters and it tracks the movement of [[tectonic plates]] with comparable accuracy. Conceived and built at MSFC, the LAGEOS was launched by a [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]] rocket in May 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1976-039A-01 "Laser Tracking Reflector"], NASA Tech Data&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravity Probe A, also called the Redshift Experiment, used an extremely precise [[hydrogen maser]] clock to confirm part of Einstein's [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]]. The probe was launched in June 1976, by a [[Scout (rocket family)|Scout]] rocket, and remained in space for near two hours, as intended.&lt;ref&gt;Vessot, R.F.C. et al. (1980). "Test of Relativistic Gravitation with a Space-Borne Hydrogen Maser" ''. Rev. Ltrs.'', vol. 45, no 26 (1980), pp. 2081–2084&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mondialogo Engineering Award''' was established by [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] and [[UNESCO]] to encourage cooperation and dialogue between engineering people from different countries and cultures, working together across continents on a joint project activity. The award invites student engineers from universities around the world to apply for Award. It was supported by the World Federation of Engineering Organisations ([[WFEO]]), who promoted it to its national members and took part in the judging panel.
The scheme has closed with Daimler and UNESCO ending their partnership in 2010. It is not clear if an alternative sponsor or scheme will be created.

==Previous Rounds==

The first round of the competition 2005 ended with a symposium in Berlin while the second round in 2007 ended in Mumbai. In its first round, the Mondialogo Engineering Award brought over 1,700 young engineers from 79 countries together to work on engineering solutions tackling [[poverty]] and promoting [[sustainable development]] in all regions of the world. While in the second round 3200 students from 89 countries participated.

==Goals==

The Mondialogo Engineering Award invited engineering students in developing and developed countries to form international teams to create project proposals that address the [[Millennium Development Goals|United Nations Millennium Development]] to 1) eradicate [[extreme poverty]] and [[hunger]]; 2) achieve [[universal primary education]]; 3) promote [[gender equality]] and [[Empowerment|empower]] women; 4) reduce [[child mortality]]; 5) improve [[maternal health]]; 6) combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and other diseases; 7) ensure environmental [[sustainability]]; and 8) develop global partnerships for development. Mondialogo encourages proposals that will improve the [[quality of life]] in the developing world, particularly [[Poverty reduction|poverty eradication]] and the promotion of sustainable development.

==Procedure==

International [[Project team|Project Teams]] eligible to apply for the Mondialogo Engineering Award consisted of two student groups from two higher education establishments, with one group from a developing country and the other from a developed country. The Mondialogo Internet Portal www.mondialogo.org acts as a contact centre for groups to meet each other, aiming to function as a virtual office for inter-group communications. Teams had until April 2009 to develop and design their project proposals. An international jury then assessed the entries and decide on the awarding, which formed part of a festive ceremony in latter 2009. Key factors in the assessment are sustainability, technical quality, feasibility of the project proposals and the quality of the intercultural cooperation between the teams.

==Criteria==

The following criteria were taken into consideration when assessing the final project proposals:
Quality of project – quality of analysis and understanding of a relevant problem, quality and innovativeness of project idea and design, and quality of presentation of the project proposal 
Degree to which the project addresses the Millennium Development Goals, especially poverty eradication and sustainable social development 
Relevance of project proposal in mitigating negative impacts of [[climate change]] 
Feasibility of the proposed project – demonstration of the practicality of implementing the proposed project, and benefit to local community; 
Quality of Dialogue – level of communication within project teams and student groups, balanced involvement of both student groups

==Awards==

Ten Mondialogo Engineering Awards of €20,000 went to teams with the top project proposals, with an Honourable Mention and €5,000 earmarked for twenty more teams. Representatives of the 30 finalist project teams (consisting of one member of each student group two members of each International Project Team) were invited to the Mondialogo Engineering Award Symposium. At the Symposium, each team made a presentation of their project proposal, followed by an Award Ceremony where the Mondialogo Engineering Awards and Honourable Mentions were announced. All participating teams that submit project proposals received an official certificate in recognition of their achievements and their commitment to the worldwide exchange of knowledge and intercultural dialogue. Additionally, Daimler and UNESCO publicized the 30 winning projects.

==Eligibility to participate==

Students from all fields of engineering were eligible to register for the Mondialogo Engineering Award. All members of the two (or more) student groups must have been officially registered as students at universities, technical colleges or similar institutions through to May 2009. Employees of commercial institutions and companies or students above 35 years of age were not eligible to participate.

[[File:Sani Pass heading into Lesotho.jpg|thumb|[[Sani Pass]] in [[Lesotho]].]]
[[File:Bwlch Maesgwm contour map.png|thumb|A mountain pass as it appears on a contour map: Bwlch Maesgwm in [[Snowdonia]], north [[Wales]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{coord|53|4|52.8|N|4|7|57|W}}, height contours from [[SRTM]] data.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''mountain pass''' is a navigable route through a [[mountain range]] or over a [[ridge]]. Since many of the world's mountain ranges have presented formidable barriers to travel, passes have played a key role in [[trade]], [[war]], and both [[Human migration|human]] and [[animal migration]] throughout Earth's history. At lower elevations it may be called a '''hill pass'''. The [[Extreme points of Earth|highest vehicle-accessible pass in the world]] appears to be [[Mana Pass]], located in the [[Himalayas]] on the border between [[India]] and [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]], [[China]].

==Overview==
[[File:Saddleroute3.JPG|thumb|Idealised mountain pass represented as the green line; the [[saddle point]] is in red.]]
Mountain passes make use of a [[gap (landform)|gap]], [[saddle (landform)|saddle]], or [[col]] (also sometimes a [[notch (landform)|notch]], the low point in a ridge). A topographic saddle is analogous to the mathematical concept of a [[saddle surface]], with a [[saddle point]] marking the highest point between two valleys and the lowest point along a ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Eberhart |first= Mark E. |title= Why Things Break: Understanding the World by the Way it Comes Apart |year= 2004 |publisher= Random House |isbn= 978-1-4000-4883-0 |page= 232 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wo9wGKk9MVsC&amp;pg=PT236 |accessdate= 6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bishop |first1= Michael P. |last2= Shroder |first2= John F. |title= Geographic Information Science and Mountain Geomorphology |year= 2004 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-3-540-42640-0 |pages= 86–87 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6TGu7-mwSNYC&amp;pg=PA86 |accessdate= 6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a [[topographic map]], passes are characterized by [[contour lines]] with an hourglass shape, which indicates a low spot between two higher points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Harvey |first1= Mark William Thornton |last2= Simer |first2= Peter |title= The National Outdoor Leadership School Wilderness Guide: The Classic Handbook |year= 1999 |publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn= 978-0-684-85909-5 |page= 185 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BHKUvFAzliYC&amp;pg=PA185 |accessdate= 6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passes are often found just above the [[Source (river or stream)|source of a river]], constituting a [[drainage divide]]. A pass may be very short, consisting of steep slopes to the top of the pass, or may be a valley many kilometres long, whose highest point might only be identifiable by [[surveying]].

Roads have long been built through passes, as well as railways more recently. Some high and rugged passes may have tunnels bored underneath a nearby mountainside (like the [[Eisenhower Tunnel]] bypassing [[Loveland Pass]] in the Rockies) to allow faster traffic flow throughout the year.

The top of a pass is frequently the only flat ground in the area, and is a high vantage point. In some cases this makes it a preferred site for buildings. If a national border follows a mountain range, a pass over the mountains is typically on the border, and there may be a [[border control]] or [[customs]] station, and possibly a military post as well. For instance [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] share the world's third-longest international border, {{convert|5300|km|mi}} long. The border runs north–south along the [[Andes]] mountains, with a total of 42 mountain passes.&lt;ref name=pasos/&gt;&lt;ref name=pasos_chile/&gt; On a road over a pass, it is customary to have a small roadside sign giving the name of the pass and its [[elevation]] [[above mean sea level]].

As well as offering relatively easy travel between valleys, passes also provide a route between two mountain tops with a minimum of descent. As a result, it is common for tracks to meet at a pass; this often makes them convenient routes even when travelling between a summit and the valley floor. Passes traditionally were places for trade routes, communications, cultural exchange, military expeditions etc. A typical example is the [[Brenner pass]] in the [[Alps]].

Some mountain passes above the [[tree line]] have problems with [[snow drift]] in the winter. This might be alleviated by building the road a few meters above the ground, which will make snow blow off the road.

==Synonyms==
There are many words for ''pass'' in the English-speaking world. In the United States, ''pass'' is very common in the [[Western United States|West]], the word ''gap'' is common in the southern [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]], ''notch'' in parts of [[New England]], and ''saddle'' in northern [[Idaho]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://itouchmap.com/?f=gap&amp;s=ID&amp;a1=&amp;start=255 Map showing "saddle" names in Idaho]&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland has the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] term ''bealach'' (anglicised "balloch"), while Wales has the similar ''bwlch'' (both being [[Insular Celtic languages|British Celtic]] languages). In the [[Lake District]] of north-west England, the term ''hause'' is often used, although the term ''pass'' is also common—one distinction is that a pass can refer to a route, as well as the highest part thereof, while a hause is simply that highest part, often flattened somewhat into a high-level plateau.

==Around the world==
There are thousands of named passes around the world, some of which are well-known, such as the [[Great St. Bernard Pass]] at {{convert|2473|m|ft}} in the [[Alps]], the [[Chang La]] at {{convert|5360|m|ft}}, and the [[Khardung La]] at {{convert|5359|m|ft}} in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], India. The roads at [[Mana Pass]] at {{convert|5610|m|ft}} and [[Marsimik La]] at {{convert|5582|m|ft}}, on and near the China-India border respectively, appear to be world's two highest motorable passes. [[Khunjerab Pass]] between [[Pakistan]] and China at {{Convert|4693|m|ft}} is also a high-altitude motorable mountain pass.

'''Network architecture''' is the design of a [[communication network]]. It is a framework for the specification of a network's [[Physical layer|physical components]] and their functional organization and configuration, its operational principles and procedures, as well as [[data type|data formats]] used. In [[telecommunication]], the specification of a network architecture may also include a detailed description of products and services delivered via a communications network, as well as detailed rate and billing structures under which services are compensated.

The network architecture of the [[Internet]] is predominantly expressed by its use of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]], rather than a specific model for interconnecting networks or nodes in the network, or the usage of specific types of hardware links.

== OSI network model ==
{{OSI model}}
{{main|OSI model}}

The [[OSI model|Open Systems Interconnection model]] (OSI model) is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection effort at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). OSI defines and codifies the concept of layered network architecture. It is a way of sub-dividing a communications system further into smaller parts called layers. A layer is a collection of similar functions that provide services to the layer above it and receives services from the layer below it. On each layer, an instance provides services to the instances at the layer above and requests service from the layer below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/OSI|title=What is OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|last=|first=|date=|work=SearchNetworking|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distributed computing ==
{{main|Distributed computing}}

In distinct usage in [[distributed computing]], the term "network architecture" often describes the structure and classification of a distributed application architecture, as the participating nodes in a distributed application are often referred to as a "network". For example, the [[applications architecture]] of the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) has been termed the [[Advanced Intelligent Network]]. There are any number of specific classifications but all lie on a continuum between the [[dumb network]] (e.g. [[Internet]]) and the [[intelligent computer network]] (e.g. the telephone network). Other networks contain various elements of these two classical types to make them suitable for various types of applications. Recently the [[context aware network]], which is a synthesis of  two, has gained much interest with its ability to combine the best elements of both.

A popular example of such usage of the term in distributed applications, as well as PVCs (permanent virtual circuits), is the organization of nodes in [[P2P network|peer-to-peer (P2P) services and networks]]. P2P networks usually implement overlay networks running over an underlying physical or logical network. These overlay network may implement certain organizational structures of the nodes according to several distinct models, the network architecture of the system.

Network architecture is a broad plan that specifies everything necessary for two application programs on different networks on an Internet to be able to work together effectively.

}} __NOTOC__
'''Papilionaceous flowers''' (from [[Latin]]: ''papilion'', a butterfly) are flowers with the characteristic [[zygomorphic|irregular]] and butterfly-like corolla found in many, though not all, plants of the species-rich [[Faboideae]] subfamily of [[Fabaceae|legumes]]. [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Tournefort]] suggested that the term ''Flores papilionacei'' originated with [[Valerius Cordus]],&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; who applied it to the flowers of the [[Phaseolus vulgaris|bean]].&lt;ref name=cordus&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cordus|first1=Valerius |title=Historia Stirpium et Sylva |chapter=162 |date=1561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
===Corolla===
The flowers have a [[Floral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]] with the [[corolla (botany)|corolla]] consisting of five [[petal]]s. A single, large, upper petal is known as the banner (also vexillum or standard petal). The semi-cylindrical base of the banner embraces and compresses two equal and smaller lateral wings (or alae). The wings in turn enclose a pair of small [[keel]] [[petal]]s, that are situated somewhat lower than the wings, but are interior to them.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; They have concave sides and correspond with the shape of the wings. The two keel petals are fused at their bases&lt;ref name=reddy/&gt; or stuck together&lt;ref name=nswfs&gt;{{cite web |title=Botanical term: papilionaceous |url=http://www.nswildflora.ca/glossary/papilionaceous.html |website=nswildflora.ca |publisher=Nova Scotia Wild Flora Society |date=2007 | accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form a boat-shaped structure that encloses the essential flower organs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gupta |first1=P.K. |title=Genetics: classical to modern |date=2007 |publisher=Rastogi Publications |location=Meerut, India |isbn=8171338968 |pages=146–147 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely the [[androecium]] and [[gynoecium]]. Typically these flowers have a vexillary (i.e. descendingly imbricate or overlapping) [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivation]].&lt;ref name=reddy&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reddy |first1=S. M. |title=University Botany III: (Plant Taxonomy, Plant Embryology, Plant Physiology) |volume = 3 |date=2007 |publisher=New Age International |isbn=9788122415476 |pages=60–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stamens===
The stamens often have a diadelphous morphology, meaning that they are united in two sets with a distinct filament shape in each set.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; The inferior set forms a membranous sheath at its base, that envelops the single, superior [[pistil]] in a tube. The tube divides into nine filaments, which trace the base of the keel petals that enclose them.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; The single free filament lies above them. In ''[[Smithia]]'' the two sets are equal, with 5 stamens in each.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;

Many papilionaceous flowers however have ten distinct stamens. Genera that conform to the latter morphology include ''[[Sophora]]'', ''[[Anagyris]]'', ''[[Cercis]]'', ''[[Daviesia]]'', ''[[Dillwynia]]'', ''[[Gompholobium]]'', ''[[Mirbelia]]'' and ''[[Pultenaea]]''.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;

==Biology==
[[Charles Darwin]] observed that the fertility of plants with papilionaceous flowers depend to an important extent on visits by bees,&lt;ref name=darw&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |title=On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life | chapter = IV: On the advantage |date=2007 |publisher=Cosimo Classics |location=New York |isbn=1602061440 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is accepted that this corolla structure evolved under selective pressure of bee pollinators.&lt;ref name=swj&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aronne |first1=Giovanna |last2=Giovanetti |first2=Manuela |last3=De Micco |first3=Veronica |title=Morphofunctional Traits and Pollination Mechanisms of Coronilla emerus L. Flowers (Fabaceae) |journal=The Scientific World Journal |date=2012 |volume=2012 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1100/2012/381575}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] remarked that they produce hardly any scent, but the flowers of [[Spartium junceum|Spanish broom]], [[Lathyrus odoratus|sweet pea]], [[Coronilla valentina|scorpion vetch]], [[Lupinus luteus|European yellow lupine]], [[Vicia faba|fava bean]] and various species of [[Trifolium|clover]] are notable exceptions.&lt;ref name=Rees&gt;{{cite book | last1=Rees | first1=Abraham | title=The Cyclopædia: Or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature | date=1819 | publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme &amp; Brown [etc.] | page=PAP |volume= 26 |accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four different mechanisms of pollen release are known in papilionaceous flowers, which are respectively known as the explosive, valvular, piston and brush mechanisms.&lt;ref name=swj/&gt; In the explosive or tripping mechanism (''cf.'' [[Medicago sativa|alfalfa]], [[Cytisus scoparius|common broom]], [[Mucuna|ox-eye bean]]&lt;ref name=mos&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mosquin |first1=Ted |title=The explosive pollination mechanism in Cornus canadensis L. |url=http://www.ou.edu/cas/botany-micro/ben/ben194.html |website=Botanical Electronic News |publisher=The Canadian Field-Naturalist, Volume 99, Number I, Jan.-Mar. 1985 |accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) all pollen is instantly released when pressure on the staminal column is permanently released (usually by an insect) causing it to snap against the standard petal. In the valvular mechanism pollen is released repeatedly when pollinators unseal the upper rim of the keel petals, and force them downwards. In the piston mechanism (''cf.'' [[Hippocrepis emerus|scorpion senna]]&lt;ref name=swj/&gt;) pollen is released repeatedly when the keel tip is moved by an insect so as to release pollen through a hole in the tip. The brush mechanism employs a pistil which is longer than the stamens, so as to avoid self-pollination. When a pollinator presses against the standard and wing petals, a brush on the temporarily lifted pistil brushes pollen onto the pollinator, while the stigma receives external pollen.&lt;ref name=swj/&gt;

==Examples and exceptions==
Well-known plant genera in the Faboideae which exhibit this corolla morphology include  [[Phaseolus|beans]], [[Pisum|peas]], [[Lathyrus|sweet peas]], [[alfalfa]] (lucerne), [[Trifolium|clovers]], [[Lupinus|lupines]], [[Dalea|smoke trees]], [[Robinia|black locust]]s, [[Astragalus|locoweed]]s and [[Erythrina|coral trees]].&lt;ref name=ww1&gt;{{cite web |last1=Armstrong |first1=W.

The [[Amorpha|false indigo]] genus, though belonging to the Faboideae, does not exhibit a papilionaceous corolla morphology, as it has only one petal per flower,&lt;ref name=aquatic&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wooten |first1=Robert K.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Other legume subfamilies==
To the contrary, plants in the [[Mimosoideae]] subfamily of legumes have the petals reduced, and have numerous stamens arranged in showy spikes. In the [[Caesalpinioideae]] subfamily of legumes the upper petal is initially enveloped by the lateral petals, before the petals unfold to assume a radial five-fold symmetry.&lt;ref name=ww1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5283">The '''photon underproduction crisis''' was a cosmological deficit between observed photons and predicted photons.&lt;ref name=CIS&gt;{{cite news |title=Cosmic accounting reveals missing light crisis| url=http://carnegiescience.edu/news/cosmic_accounting_reveals_missing_light_crisis|work=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]], News |date=July 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/mystery-missing-light-071620142 |title=The Mystery of the Missing Light|date=July 16, 2014 |first=Maria |last=Temming |work=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deficit, or underproduction crisis, is a theoretical problem, arising from comparing observations of ultraviolet light emitted from known populations of [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s to theoretical predictions of the amount of ultraviolet light require to simulate the observed distribution of the hydrogen gas in the local universe in a cosmological simulation. The distribution of hydrogen gas was inferred using [[Lyman-alpha forest]] observations from [[Hubble Space Telescope]]’s [[Cosmic Origins Spectrograph]].&lt;ref&gt;Danforth et. al, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2655 "on arXiv"], ''Submitted to ApJ'',&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of light from galaxies and quasars can be estimated from its effect on the distribution of hydrogen and helium in the regions between galaxies. Highly energetic ultraviolet photons can convert electrically neutral hydrogen gas into ionized gas. A team led by [[Juna Kollmeier]] reported an unexpected deficit of roughly 400% between ionizing light from known sources and the actual observations of intergalactic hydrogen. Kollmeier and her team wrote in their scientific report, “We examine the statistics of the low-redshift [[Lyman-alpha forest]] from smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations in light of recent improvements in the estimated evolution of the cosmic ultraviolet background (UVB) and recent observations from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). We find that the value of the metagalactic photoionization rate required by our simulations to match the observed properties of the low-redshift Lyman-alpha forest is a factor of 5 larger than the value predicted by state-of-the art models for the evolution of this quantity.”&lt;ref name=ApJL&gt;{{cite journal |date=2014 | title=The Photon Underproduction Crisis | journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal|The Astrophysical Journal Letters]]| volume=798  | issue=2 | pages=L32  | doi=10.1088/2041-8205/789/2/L32 | first=Juna |last=Kollmeier|display-authors=4|last2=Weinberg  | first2=David H.  | last3=Oppenheimer  | first3=Benjamin D. | last4=Haardt | first4=Francesco  | last5=Katz | first5=Neal  | last6=Davé | first6=Romeel A.  | last7=Fardal  | first7=Mark  | last8=Madau  | first8=Piero | last9=Danforth | first9=Charles  | last10=Ford  | first10 =Amanda B. | last11=Peeples | first11=Molly S. | last12 =McEwen | first12 =Joseph  |arxiv = 1404.2933 |bibcode = 2014ApJ...789L..32K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmological simulations start at very high cosmological redshift z (such as z=100 or larger) and are evolved to z=0. According to Benjamin D. Oppenheimer, who is one of the report's coauthors, “The simulations fit the data beautifully in the early universe, and they fit the local data beautifully if we’re allowed to assume that this extra light is really there. It's possible the simulations do not reflect reality, which by itself would be a surprise, because intergalactic hydrogen is the component of the Universe that we think we understand the best.”&lt;ref name=CIS/&gt; Kollmeier and her team state that "... either conventional sources of ionizing photons (galaxies and quasars) must contribute considerably more than current observational estimates or our theoretical understanding of the low-redshift universe is in need of substantial revision.”&lt;ref name=ApJL/&gt; Similar study, led by Michael Shull, found that the deficit is only factor 2 large and not a factor 5 as previously claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Shull, Moloney, Danforth, Tilton 2015 [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/811/1/3/meta], ''Astrophysical Journal'',&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The photon underproduction crisis is resolved by a series of recent papers.  Khaire &amp; Srianand &lt;ref&gt;Khaire &amp; Srianand 2015, [http://mnrasl.oxfordjournals.org/content/451/1/L30], ''MNRAS Letters'',&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a factor 2 to 5 times large metagalactic photoionization rate can be easily obtained using updated quasar and galaxy observations. Recent observations of quasars indicate that the quasar contribution to ultraviolet photons is factor 2 large as compared to previous estimates. The revised galaxy contribution is also factor 3 higher. Furthermore, the Kollmeier GADGET-2 simulations did not include heating from [[active galactic nuclei]] (AGN) feedback. Including AGN feedback was shown to be an important element for heating in the low redshift [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM) (Gurvich, Burkhart, &amp; Bird 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03293&lt;/ref&gt;). This implies that the low redshift COS data can be used to calibrate AGN feedback models in cosmological simulations.

'''Plant–soil feedback''' is a process where plants alter the [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] qualities of [[soil]] they grow in, which then alters the ability of plants to grow in that soil in the future.&lt;ref name="bever1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bever|first1=James D.|title=Feeback between Plants and Their Soil Communities in an Old Field Community|journal=Ecology|date=1 January 1994|volume=75|issue=7|pages=1965–1977|doi=10.2307/1941601|jstor=1941601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bever|first1=James D.|last2=Westover|first2=Kristi M.|last3=Antonovics|first3=Janis|title=Incorporating the Soil Community into Plant Population Dynamics: The Utility of the Feedback Approach|journal=The Journal of Ecology|date=October 1997|volume=85|issue=5|pages=561|doi=10.2307/2960528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative plant–soil feedback occurs when plants are less able to grow in soil that was previously occupied by a member of the same species, and positive plant–soil feedback occurs when plants are more able to grow in soil that was previously occupied by a member of the same species.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;  Although it was originally assumed that negative plant–soil feedback was caused by plants depleting the soil of [[nutrient]]s, recent work has suggested that a major cause of plant–soil feedback is a buildup of soil-borne [[pathogen]]s.&lt;ref name="bever1994" /&gt;  [[Mutualism (biology)|Mutualism]] and [[allelopathy]] are also thought to cause plant–soil feedback.  Studies have shown that, on average, plant–soil feedback tends to be negative;&lt;ref name="kulmatiski_et_al_2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulmatiski|first1=Andrew|last2=Beard|first2=Karen H.|last3=Stevens|first3=John R.|last4=Cobbold|first4=Stephanie M.|title=Plant-soil feedbacks: a meta-analytical review|journal=Ecology Letters|date=September 2008|volume=11|issue=9|pages=980–992|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01209.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there have been many notable exceptions, such as many invasive species.&lt;ref name="Klironomos2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klironomos|first1=John N.|title=Feedback with soil biota contributes to plant rarity and invasiveness in communities|journal=Nature|date=2 May 2002|volume=417|issue=6884|pages=67–70|doi=10.1038/417067a|pmid=11986666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative plant–soil feedback is thought to be an important factor in helping plants to [[coexistence theory|coexist]].  If a plant is over-abundant, then soil pathogens and other negative factors will become common, hurting its growth.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;  Similarly, if a plant becomes overly rare, then so too will its soil pathogens and other negative factors, helping its growth.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;  This [[negative feedback]] will help populations to stay in the community.  Negative plant–soil feedback has been called a particular case of the [[Janzen–Connell hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Petermann_et_al_2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petermann|first1=Jana S.|last2=Fergus|first2=Alexander J. F.|last3=Turnbull|first3=Lindsay A.|last4=Schmid|first4=Bernhard|title=JANZEN-CONNELL EFFECTS ARE WIDESPREAD AND STRONG ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN DIVERSITY IN GRASSLANDS|journal=Ecology|date=September 2008|volume=89|issue=9|pages=2399–2406|doi=10.1890/07-2056.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring plant–soil feedback==

Plant–soil feedback is best measured using Bever's interaction coefficient, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;  This value quantifies how much each plant's growth is limited by its own soil community compared to how much it limits others.  It is for two-species comparisons.  To measure this quantity, one must measure the growth of two plants, both in soil conditioned by members of their own species (''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''(home) for species ''x''), and in soil conditioned by members of the other species (''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''(away) for plant species ''x'').  Then, the interaction coefficient is calculated as

: &lt;math&gt;I_s=G_x(\mbox{home})+G_y(\mbox{home})-G_x(\mbox{away})-G_y(\mbox{away}). &lt;/math&gt;

If ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is negative, it means that both species grow worse in their own site compared to their competitor's soil, and therefore plant–soil feedback helps these species to coexist.&lt;ref name="bever_et_al_1997" /&gt;

'''Pleistocene Park''' ({{lang-ru|Плейстоценовый парк}}) is a [[nature reserve]] on the [[Kolyma River]] south of [[Chersky (settlement)|Chersky]] in the [[Sakha Republic]], [[Russia]], in northeastern [[Siberia]], where an attempt is being made to recreate the [[Mammoth steppe|northern subarctic steppe grassland ecosystem]] that flourished in the area during the [[last glacial period]].&lt;ref name="natgeo2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eli Kintisch: Born to Rewild. 2015" /&gt;

The project is being led by [[Russia]]n scientists [[Sergey Zimov]] and [[Nikita Zimov]],&lt;ref name="meyer2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Indiegogo 2018, update 30 May 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anna Stroganova: Bison for Siberia. 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp materials diary-nikita-wrangel-2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zoologist 84" /&gt; testing the [[hypothesis]] that repopulating with large herbivores (and predators) can restore rich grasslands ecosystems, as expected if [[Quaternary extinction event#Hunting hypothesis|overhunting]], and not [[Quaternary extinction event#Climate change hypothesis|climate change]], was primarily responsible for the extinction of wildlife and the disappearance of the grasslands at the [[Quaternary extinction event|end of the Pleistocene epoch]].&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;

The aim of the project is to research the climatic effects of the expected changes in the ecosystem. Here the hypothesis is that the change from [[tundra]] to grassland will result in a raised ratio of energy emission to energy absorption of the area, leading to less thawing of permafrost and thereby less emission of [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt; It is also thought that removal of snow by large herbivores will further reduce the permafrost's insulation.

To study this, large [[herbivore]]s have been released, and their effect on the local fauna is being monitored. Preliminary results point at the ecologically low-grade tundra [[biome]] being converted into a productive grassland biome, and at the energy emission of the area being raised.&lt;ref name="OttawaLife 2013: The Zimovs" /&gt;

A documentary is being produced about the park by an American journalist and filmmaker.&lt;ref name="Griswold-Tergis 2013: Pleistocene Park pt.1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold-Tergis: Pleistocene Park Movie. fb" /&gt;

== Goals ==

=== Researching the effects of large herbivores on the arctic tundra/grasslands ecosystem ===
The primary aim of Pleistocene Park is to recreate the mammoth steppe (ancient [[taiga]]/[[tundra]] grasslands that were widespread in the region during the last ice age). The key concept is that animals, rather than climate, maintained that ecosystem. Reintroducing large herbivores to Siberia would then initiate a positive feedback loop promoting the reestablishment of grassland ecosystems. This argument is the basis for [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] Pleistocene Park's landscape with [[megafauna]] that were previously abundant in the area, as evidenced by the fossil record.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon. QSR" /&gt;

The [[Mammoth steppe|grassland-steppe ecosystem]] that dominated Siberia during the [[Pleistocene]] disappeared 10,000 years ago and was replaced by a mossy and forested [[tundra]] and [[taiga]] ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;  Concurrently, most of the large herbivores that roamed Siberia during the Pleistocene have vanished from the region.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt; The mainstream explanation for this used to be that at the beginning of the [[Holocene]] the arid steppe climate changed into a humid one, and when the steppe vanished so did the steppe's animals.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt; Sergei Zimov points out that in contradiction to this scenario:
* Similar climatic shifts occurred in previous interglacial periods without causing such massive environmental changes,&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon. QSR" /&gt;
* Those large herbivores of the former steppe that survived until today (e.g. [[Muskox|musk oxen]], [[bison]], [[Equus ferus|horses]]) thrive in humid environments just as well as in arid ones,&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon. QSR" /&gt;
* The climate (both temperatures and humidity) in today's northern Siberia is in fact similar to that of the [[mammoth steppe]]. The radiation aridity index for northern Siberia on [[Mikhail Budyko]]'s scale is 2 (= steppe bordering on semi-desert).&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon. QSR" /&gt; [[Aridity index#Budyko's index|Budyko's scale]] compares the ratio of the energy received by the earth's surface to the energy required for the evaporation of the total annual precipitation. The 'humid climate' argument was based on [[Aridity index|other scales]], which compare precipitation to [[potential evapotranspiration]]. Moss has a very low transpiration rate and thus causes humidity without necessarily needing humidity for its establishment. Using these other scales as a proof for humidity being the cause of the disappearance of the grasslands therefore constitutes a [[begging the question|circular argument]], which is not scientifically viable.
Zimov and colleagues argue for a reversed order of environmental change in the mammoth steppe. Humans, with their constantly improving technology, overhunted the large herbivores and led to their extinction and extirpation.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon. QSR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf 2008: Big Thaw" /&gt;  Without herbivores grazing and trampling over the land, mosses, shrubs and trees were able to take over and replace the grassland ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon. QSR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf 2008: Big Thaw" /&gt; If the grasslands were destroyed because herbivore populations were decimated by human hunting, then "it stands to reason that those landscapes can be reconstituted by the judicious return of appropriate herbivore communities."&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;

=== Researching the effects of large herbivores on permafrost and global warming ===
{{See also|Permafrost#Climate change effects}}
A secondary aim is to research the climatic effects of the expected changes in the ecosystem. Here the key concept is that some of the effects of the large herbivores, such as eradicating trees and shrubs or trampling snow, will result in a stronger cooling of the ground in the winter, leading to less thawing of [[permafrost]] during summer and thereby less emission of [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold-Tergis 2013: Pleistocene Park pt.1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon. QSR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold-Tergis 2013: Pleistocene Park pt.2" /&gt;

{{wikinews|Scientists warn thawing Siberia may trigger global meltdown}}
Permafrost is a large global carbon reservoir that has remained frozen throughout much of the Holocene.&lt;ref name="Zimov, Schuur, Chapin 2006: Permafrost and Global" /&gt;  Due to recent [[global warming|climate change]], the permafrost is beginning to thaw, releasing stored carbon and forming [[Thermokarst|thermokarst lakes]].&lt;ref name="Zimov, Schuur, Chapin 2006: Permafrost and Global" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimes 2007: lakes a major source" /&gt;  When the thawed permafrost enters the thermokarst lakes, its carbon is converted into [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gases|carbon dioxide and methane]] and released into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Walter et al 2007: Thermokarst Lakes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter et al 2006: Methane bubbling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 1997: North Siberian Lakes" /&gt; [[Atmospheric methane#Methane as a greenhouse gas|Methane is a potent greenhouse gas]] and the methane emissions from thermokarst lakes have the potential to initiate a [[positive feedback|positive feedback cycle]] in which increased atmospheric methane concentrations lead to amplified global climate change, which in turn leads to more permafrost thaw and more methane and carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name="Walter et al 2006: Methane bubbling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 1997: North Siberian Lakes" /&gt;

As the combined carbon stored in the world's permafrost (1670 [[Gigatonne|Gt]])&lt;ref name="Tarnocai et al (2009): Soil organic" /&gt; equals about two times the amount of the carbon currently released in the atmosphere (720 Gt),&lt;ref name="Falkowski et al 2000: Global Carbon Cycle" /&gt; the setting in motion of such a positive feedback cycle could potentially lead to [[runaway climate change]] scenario. Even if the ecological situation of the arctic were as it was 400,000 years ago (i.e., grasslands instead of tundra), a global temperature rise of 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C (2.7&amp;nbsp;°F) relative to the pre-industrial level would be enough to start the thawing of permafrost in Siberia.&lt;ref name="Fiona Harvey 2013 / Vaks et al 2013: Speleothems" /&gt;  An increased cooling of the ground during winter would raise the current [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]], potentially delaying such a scenario.

== Implementation ==

=== Background: regional Pleistocene ecoregions ===
It has been proposed that the introduction of a variety of large herbivores will recreate their ancient [[ecological niche]]s in Siberia and regenerate the Pleistocene terrain with its different ecological habitats such as [[taiga]], [[tundra]], [[steppe]] and [[alpine-steppe|alpine terrain]].

The main object, however, is to recreate the extensive grasslands that covered the [[Beringia|Beringia region]] in the late Pleistocene. This form of grassland (also known as [[mammoth steppe]]) was inhabited by a diverse set of large and medium herbivores. Back in the Pleistocene the area was populated by many species of [[grazers]] that assembled in large herds similar in size to those in Africa today. Species that roamed the great grasslands included the [[woolly mammoth]], [[woolly rhino]], [[steppe wisent]], [[Lena horse]], [[muskox]], and [[reindeer]].

Another herbivore that was abundant in this region during the Pleistocene but now faces possible extinction in its remaining habitats is the [[saiga antelope]], which can form massive herds that keep the vegetation down.

At the edges of these large stretches of grassland could be found more shrub-like terrain and dry conifer forests (similar to taiga). In this terrain the [[browsing (predation)|browsers]] of the Pleistocene were to be found. This group of megafauna included [[woolly rhinoceros]], [[moose]], [[wapiti]], [[Equus lambei|Yukon wild ass]], and [[camel]]s. The more mountainous terrain was occupied by several species of mountain-going animals like the [[snow sheep]].

Back in the Pleistocene there was also a great variety of carnivorous mammals as well. On the plains there were prides of [[Beringian cave lion]]. These large cats were the apex predators of the region, but also shared their habitat with other predators such as [[grey wolf]], [[cave hyena]], ''[[Homotherium]]'', [[brown bear]], [[wolverine]], and [[Arctic fox]], which all occupied a distinct ecological niche essential for the balance of their respective ecosystems.

On the edges of the grasslands (in the shrubs and forests) there were also [[brown bear]]s, [[wolverine]]s, [[cave bear]]s, [[lynx]]es, [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[red fox]]es. The [[Siberian tiger]] and [[Amur leopard]] occupied the southern part of the steppe biome and surviving populations are still found along the present Russian-Sino border in the [[Amur region|Amur]] and [[Primorye|Primorye region]]s.

=== Proposed procedure ===
In present-day Siberia only a few of the former species of megafauna are left, and their population density is extremely low, too low to affect the environment. To reach the desired effects, the density has to be raised artificially by fencing in and concentrating the existing large herbivores. A large variety of species is important as each species affects the environment differently and as the overall stability of the ecosystem increases with the variety of species&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt; (compare ''[[Biodiversity#Biodiversity and ecological services]]''). Their numbers will be raised by reintroducing species that went locally extinct (e.g., [[muskox]]en). For species that went completely extinct, suitable replacements will be introduced if possible (e.g., [[wild Bactrian camel]]s for the extinct Pleistocene camels of the genus [[Paracamelus]]). As the number of herbivores increases, the enclosure will be expanded.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp Scientific background" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Good fence, Russian, 2006" /&gt;

While this is taking place, the effects will be monitored. This concerns for example the effects on the flora (are the mosses being replaced by grasses, etc.), the effects on the atmosphere (changes in levels of methane, carbon dioxide, water vapor) and the effects on the [[permafrost]].&lt;ref name="OttawaLife 2013: The Zimovs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPost 2010: Russian Scientist Working To Recreate Ice Age Ecosystem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sakha news" /&gt;

Finally, once a high density of herbivores over a vast area has been reached, predators larger than the wolves will have to be introduced to keep the megafauna in check.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;

=== Progress and plans ===
;1988–1996
The first grazing experiments began in 1988 at the [[Northeast Science Station (Russia)|Northeast Science Station]] in Chersky with [[Yakutian horse]]s.&lt;ref name="OttawaLife 2013: The Zimovs" /&gt;

;1996–2004
In 1996 a 50 [[Hectare|ha]] (125 [[acre]]) enclosure was built in Pleistocene Park.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt; As a first step in recreating the ancient landscape, the Yakutian horses were introduced, as horses had been the most abundant [[ungulate]]s on the northeastern Siberian mammoth steppe.&lt;ref name="Gennady: The North of Eastern Siberia, 2004" /&gt; Of the first 40 horses, 15 were killed by predators and 12 died of eating poisonous plants. More horses were imported, and they learned to cope with the environment.&lt;ref name="HuffPost 2010: Russian Scientist Working To Recreate Ice Age Ecosystem" /&gt; In 2006 approximately 20 horses lived in the park,&lt;ref name="Radio Svoboda, Zimov interview, 2006" /&gt; and by 2007 more horses were being born annually than died.&lt;ref name="HuffPost 2010: Russian Scientist Working To Recreate Ice Age Ecosystem" /&gt; By 2013, the number had risen to about 30.&lt;ref name="zoologist 78" /&gt; Moose, present in the area, were also introduced.&lt;ref name="pp Pleistocene Park" /&gt; The effects of large animals (mammoths and wisents) on nature were artificially created by using an [[Military engineering vehicle|engineering tank]] and an 8-wheel drive [[ARGO (ATV manufacturer)|Argo all-terrain vehicle]] to crush pathways through the willow shrub.&lt;ref name="Wolf 2008: Big Thaw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark Paricio: Polaris Project. 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp machinery 62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fanny Kittler: Summer Blog: Chersky 2013 - Pleistocene Park" /&gt;

[[File:Pleistocene Park.jpg|thumb|Restored grasslands in Pleistocene Park]]The vegetation in the park started to change. In the areas where the horses grazed, the soil has been compacted&lt;ref name="sakha news" /&gt; and mosses, weeds and willow shrub were replaced by grasses.&lt;ref name="meyer2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OttawaLife 2013: The Zimovs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Good fence, Russian, 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Terry Chapin pp site: Pleistocene Park Concept" /&gt; Flat grassland is now the dominating landscape inside the park.&lt;ref name="Fanny Kittler: Summer Blog: Chersky 2013 - Pleistocene Park" /&gt; The permafrost was also influenced by the grazers. When air temperature sank to –40&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] (–40&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]]) in winter, the temperature of the ground was found to be only –5&amp;nbsp;°C (+23&amp;nbsp;°F) under an intact cover of snow, but –30&amp;nbsp;°C (–22&amp;nbsp;°F) where the animals had trampled down the snow. The grazers thus help keep permafrost intact, thereby lessening the amount of methane released by the tundra.&lt;ref name="OttawaLife 2013: The Zimovs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon. QSR" /&gt;

;2004–2011
In the years 2004–2005 a new fence was erected, creating an enclosure of 16 [[Square kilometre|km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] (6 [[Square mile|sq mi]]).&lt;ref name="Good fence, Russian, 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp Homepage" /&gt;

The new enclosure finally allowed a more rapid development of the project.&lt;ref name="Good fence, Russian, 2006" /&gt; After the fence was completed, reindeer were brought into the park from herds in the region and are now the most numerous ungulates in the park.&lt;ref name="pp Pleistocene Park" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp Reindeer" /&gt; To increase moose density in the park, special constructions were added to the fence in several places that allow animals outside the fenced area to enter the park, while not allowing them to leave. Besides that, wild moose calves were caught in other regions and transported to the park.&lt;ref name="pp Moose" /&gt;

In 2007 a 32-meter (105-foot) high tower was erected in the park that constantly monitors the levels of methane, carbon dioxide and water vapor in the park's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="HuffPost 2010: Russian Scientist Working To Recreate Ice Age Ecosystem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp pleistocene park 10" /&gt;

In September 2010 the [[muskox]] was reintroduced.

;2011–2016
In the years 2011 to 2016 progress slowed down as most energy was put into the construction of a 150 [[Hectare|ha]] (370 [[Acre|ac]]) branch of Pleistocene Park near the city of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] in [[Tula Oblast]] in Europe,&lt;ref name="zoologist 78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp news 22" /&gt; see below ([[#Southern branch of Pleistocene Park: The Wild Field wilderness reserve|Wild Field]] section). A few more reindeer and moose were introduced into Pleistocene Park during this time,&lt;ref name="pp news 22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp news 10" /&gt; and a monitoring system for measuring the [[energy balance (disambiguation)|energy balance]]&lt;!-- for reason why link leads to disambiguation page see following note (ref group=note name="energy balance") --&gt; (ratio of energy emission and energy absorption)&lt;ref group=note name="energy balance"&gt;Wikipedia has no good basic article or at least article section on the energy balance (ratio of energy emission and energy absorption) of land surfaces – what it is, what affects it, etc. Some information may be gleaned from the articles

;2017–
Attention has now been shifted back to the further development of Pleistocene Park. A successful [[crowdfunding]] effort in early 2017 provided funding for further animal acquisitions.&lt;ref name="Kickstarter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adele Peters: … on the ферма. 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="David Addison: A steppe towards a new age. 2017" /&gt;  Later that year twelve domestic yak&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 13 June 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 24 June 2017" /&gt; and 30 domestic sheep&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 8 September 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 7 October 2017" /&gt; were brought to the park. The introduction of a herd of 12 plains bison is planned for May 2018,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/PleistocenePark/posts/440201056399594|title=Pleistocene Park|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/PleistocenePark/videos/vb.271986773221024/461247900961576/?type=3&amp;theater|title=Pleistocene Park|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of more muskoxen is planned for 2019.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/PleistocenePark/posts/441396572946709|title=Pleistocene Park|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the near future the focus in animal introductions will generally be placed on browsers, not grazers, i.e., bison, muskoxen, moose and wapiti. Their role in this phase will be to diminish the amount of shrubs and trees and enlarge the grassy areas. Only when these areas have sufficiently increased will grazers like saiga and kiang be introduced.&lt;ref name="RIA Novosti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zoologist 37" /&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Controversial aspects ===
Critics admonish that introducing alien species could damage the fragile ecosystem of the existing tundra. To this criticism [[Sergey Zimov]] replied: "Tundra – that is not an ecosystem. Such systems had not existed on the planet [before the disappearance of the megafauna], and there is nothing to cherish in the tundra. Of course, it would be silly to create a desert instead of the tundra, but if the same site would evolve into a steppe, then it certainly would improve the environment. If deer, foxes, bovines were more abundant, nature would only benefit from this. And people too. However, the danger still exists, of course, you have to be very careful. If it is a revival of the steppes, then, for example, small animals are really dangerous to release without control. As for large herbivores – no danger, as they are very easy to remove again."&lt;ref name="Полiт.ру 2006: Siberian park ‘mammoth period'" /&gt;

Another point of concern is doubt that the majority of species can be introduced in such harsh conditions. For example, according to some critics, the Yakutian horses, although they have been living in the park for several generations, would not have survived without human intervention. They normally tolerate –60&amp;nbsp;°C, but are said to cope poorly with an abundance of snow and possibly would have died within the first snowy winter of starvation. However, horses of much less primitive stock abandoned by the Japanese Army have been living feral on some uninhabited Kuril Islands since 1945. Despite the deep snows (two to three times deeper than in Yakutia), they have successfully survived all the winters without feeding. And in Pleistocene Park, while some of the Yakutian horses accept supplementary feeding, others keep away and survive on their own.&lt;ref name="HuffPost 2010: Russian Scientist Working To Recreate Ice Age Ecosystem" /&gt;

=== Positive reception ===
The Zimov’s concept of Pleistocene Park and repopulating the mammoth steppe is listed as one of the “100 most substantive solutions to global warming” by [[Project Drawdown]].&lt;ref name="Drawdown-mammoth steppe" /&gt;  The list, encompassing only technologically viable, existing solutions, was compiled by a team of over 200 scholars, scientists, policymakers, business leaders and activists;&lt;ref name="Book Passage-drawdown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Drawdown" /&gt; for each solution the carbon impact through the year 2050, the total and net cost to society, and the total lifetime savings were measured and modelled.&lt;ref name="Drawdown-solutions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenBiz 2014" /&gt;

== Visitors ==
The park is a hub for international scientists and students, who come from around the world to conduct their own ecological research and experiments.&lt;ref name="OttawaLife 2013: The Zimovs" /&gt; The Polaris Project was a yearly visitor from 2009 to 2015, sending US-American students on excursions to the park each summer.&lt;ref name="Polaris Project: Blog" /&gt;

Another group of visitors are journalists. The park is steadily gaining more media attention and while most journalists do not come to the park itself the number of visitors is increasing. In 2016 for example, the park was visited by a filmmaker, two print media (Swiss ''[[24 heures (Switzerland)|24 Heures]]'' and American ''[[The Atlantic]]''), and two TV broadcasting companies (German ''[[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]'' and American ''[[Vice on HBO|HBO]]'').&lt;ref name="pp news 24" /&gt;

The total of visitors for 2016 (summer months only) was 45.&lt;ref name="pp news 23" /&gt;

== Size and administration ==
Pleistocene Park is a 16&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; scientific [[nature reserve]] (''[[zakaznik]]'') consisting of [[Shrubland|willow brush]], [[Grassland#Tundra|grasslands]], [[Wetland|swamps]], [[forest]]s and a multitude of [[lake]]s.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Re-Establishment FES" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="160km2"|A newer source talks of “around 14 thousand hectares” (140&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),&lt;ref name="Anna Stroganova: Bison for Siberia. 2018" /&gt; but as the two older references&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Re-Establishment FES" /&gt; were written by Sergey Zimov himself while the newer source was written by a journalist, 160&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is more likely to be the correct number.}} The average temperature in January is about –33&amp;nbsp;°C and in July +12&amp;nbsp;°C; annual precipitation is 200–250&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;

Pleistocene Park is owned and administered by a non-profit corporation, the Pleistocene Park Association, consisting of the [[ecologist]]s from the [[Northeast Science Station (Russia)|Northeast Science Station]] in Chersky and the [[Grassland Institute]] in [[Yakutsk]].&lt;ref name="Re-Establishment FES" /&gt; The present park area was signed over to the association by the state and is exempt from land tax.&lt;ref name="Anna Stroganova: Bison for Siberia. 2018" /&gt; The reserve is surrounded by a 600&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; buffer zone that will be added to the park by the regional government once the animals have successfully established themselves.&lt;ref name="Re-Establishment FES" /&gt;

In July 2015 the [http://pleistocenepark.org/ Pleistocene Park Foundation] was founded, a non-profit organization (registered in Pennsylvania, USA, with [[501(c)(3)]] status)&lt;ref name="PPF" /&gt; dedicated to acquiring private donations for funding Pleistocene Park.&lt;ref name="pp news 20" /&gt;  Hitherto Pleistocene Park had been financed solely through the funds of the founders, a practice that grew increasingly insufficient.&lt;ref name="pp news 20" /&gt;

== Animals ==

'''Animals already present in the park:'''

''Herbivores:''
[[File:Лошади темная 3 малень wiki.jpg|thumb|[[Yakutian horse]]s]]
* [[Reindeer]] (''[[Rangifer tarandus]]''):&lt;ref name="pp Reindeer" /&gt; Present before the project started (although more are being brought to help simulate Pleistocene conditions). They mainly graze in the southern highlands of the park. This territory is not affected by spring flooding and dominated by larch forests and shrubland. Reindeer rarely visit the flood plain. Besides actively grazing (especially in winter) they browse on willow shrubs, [[tree moss]], and [[lichen]]s. (Numbers in park in July 2017: approximately 20)&lt;ref name="Anna-Lena Laurén: Sibirien sjunker sakta, DN 31 July 2017" /&gt;
* [[Alces alces|Elk]]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[British English|BE]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;/moose&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[American English|AE]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (''[[Alces alces]]''):&lt;ref name="pp Moose" /&gt; Present before the project started, although in low numbers. Immigration from neighboring areas is stimulated. Due to poaching the density of moose in the region has substantially decreased in the last 20 years. To increase moose density in the park, special constructions were added to the fence in several places that allow animals outside the fenced area to enter the park, while not allowing them to leave. Besides that wild moose calves are being caught in other regions and transported to the park.&lt;ref name="pp Moose" /&gt; It is the largest extant species of the deer family and one of the largest herbivores in the park today. (Numbers in park in July 2017: approximately 15)&lt;ref name="Anna-Lena Laurén: Sibirien sjunker sakta, DN 31 July 2017" /&gt;
* [[Yakutian horse]] (a domestic breed of ''[[Equus ferus caballus]]''):&lt;ref name="pp Horses" /&gt; The first species to be introduced for the project, they were imported from the surrounding [[Srednekolymsk]] region beginning in 1988.&lt;ref name="pp Horses" /&gt; Yakutian horses have developed a [[Yakutian horse#Adaption to the Siberian environment|range of remarkable morphologic, metabolic and physiologic adaptions]] to the harsh environment of Siberia, including an extremely dense and long winter coat, a compact build, a metabolism adjusted to seasonal needs, and an increased production of antifreezing compounds.&lt;ref name="Pablo Librado et al., Tracking the origins of Yakutian horses, 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uffe Wilken, A tale of Yakutian horses, 2017" /&gt; In summer they grow very large hooves, which they wear down in winter scraping away snow to get at food. Despite their size, they proved to be dominant over the wisents, who often fled from them. Yakutian horses are purely grazing animals – they eat only [[Graminoid|grass species]], and visit the park's forests only during the spring flood. In the spring of 2015, ten more Yakutian horses were acquired to increase genetic diversity.&lt;ref name="Jake Kong 11 April 2015" /&gt; (Numbers in park in May 2018: approximately 30)&lt;ref name="Anna Stroganova: Bison for Siberia. 2018" /&gt;
[[File:Greenland-musk-ox hg.jpg|thumb|[[Muskox]]en family]]
* [[Muskox]] (''[[Ovibos moschatus]]''):&lt;ref name="pp Musk ox" /&gt; Muskoxen arrived at the park in September 2010. They were brought from [[Wrangel Island]]&lt;ref name="pp Musk ox" /&gt; (itself repopulated with animals from [[North America]]). They are doing well and are now fully grown. Unfortunately only males could be acquired, and the Zimovs are now urgently looking for females.&lt;ref name="pp news 13" /&gt; The introduction of more muskoxen is planned for 2019.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (Numbers in park in July 2017: 3 males)&lt;ref name="Anna-Lena Laurén: Sibirien sjunker sakta, DN 31 July 2017" /&gt;
* [[Wisent]] (European bison, ''[[Bison bonasus]]''):&lt;ref name="pp Bison" /&gt; During the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], wisents were the most cold-adapted of the ''Bison'' species and thrived in the glacial grassland-steppe biome.&lt;ref name="Soubrier et al. 2016: Early cave art and ancient DNA" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Two bison species are known to have co-existed during that period in Eurasia, the [[steppe bison]] (''Bison priscus'', the ancestor of today’s American bison) and the ancestral form of today’s wisent.  A study on the distribution of these two species in the Urals, the Caucasus and Western Europe found that population replacements between steppe bison and wisent occurred regularly in correlation “with major palaeoenvironmental shifts”, with the wisent being “associated with colder, more tundra-like landscapes and absence of a warm summer” while the steppe bison dominated during the warmer [[interstadial]]s.  During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] the steppe bison disappeared from all of the area covered by the study, leaving only the wisent.&lt;ref name="Soubrier et al. 2016: Early cave art and ancient DNA" /&gt;}}  Their dietary needs are very different from the American bison. Year-round 10% of their intake necessarily consists of trees and shrubs, and they will ignore their main forage ([[Poaceae|grasses]], [[sedge]]s and [[forb]]s) in favour of woody forage to reach this quota.&lt;ref name="ADW: wisent" /&gt;  Without supplementary feeding in winter, the yearly average may rise to 20% even in countries with mild winters.&lt;ref name="Joris Cromsigt et al., 17 December 2017" /&gt;  Five wisents, one adult male and four juvenile females, were introduced in the park in April 2011. The wisents were brought to the park from the [[Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Reserve]] near Moscow.&lt;ref name="БезФормата.Ru 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp Bison" /&gt; The transportation was more complicated and took a longer time than originally thought, but all the animals recovered rapidly after the trip. Unfortunately, the wisents did not sufficiently acclimatize in the first months. They started to [[moult]] in November, when temperatures already were down to –30 [[Celsius|°C]] (–35 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]) in Cherskii. The four juveniles died; only the adult bull survived. He is now fully acclimatized.&lt;ref name="zoologist 78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp bison 241" /&gt; (Numbers in park in July 2017: 1 male)&lt;ref name="Anna-Lena Laurén: Sibirien sjunker sakta, DN 31 July 2017" /&gt;

This is a list only of animals whose introduction is planned or considered by the park management.
Only add animals together with a reliable source showing that the species in question is being considered for reintroduction by the Zimovs (the directors of Pleistocene Park and Northeast Science Station).

* [[Woolly mammoth]] (''Mammuthus primigenius''): In January 2011, the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' reported that a team of scientists from [[Kyoto University]] were planning to extract DNA from a mammoth carcass preserved in a Russian laboratory and insert it into egg cells of [[elephant]]s in hope of creating a mammoth embryo. If the experiment succeeded, the calf would be taken to the park along with others to form a wild population. The researchers claimed that their aim was to produce the first mammoth within six years.&lt;ref name="VoR 2011: Pleistocene Park: so far without mammoths." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis: Regeneration of the Mammoth Steppe?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brad Lendon: Mammoth.

== Southern branch of Pleistocene Park: The Wild Field wilderness reserve ==
{{Main|Wild Field (wilderness reserve)}}
In 2012 to 2014 a branch of Pleistocene Park named "Wild Field" ({{lang-ru|Дикое поле}} {{transl|ru|Dikoe pole}}) was constructed near the city of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] in [[Tula Oblast]] in the European part of Russia, approximately 250&amp;nbsp;km (150&amp;nbsp;mi) south of Moscow.&lt;ref name="zoologist 78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp news 14" /&gt;

Unlike Pleistocene Park, Wild Field's primary purpose is not scientific research but public outreach, i.e., it will provide a model of what an unregulated [[Eurasian Steppe|steppe ecosystem]] looked like before the advent of humans. It is situated near a federal road and a railway station and will be accessible to the general public.&lt;ref name="pp news 14" /&gt;

Wild Field comprises 300&amp;nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]] (740&amp;nbsp;[[Acre|ac]])&lt;ref name="pp news 14" /&gt; of which 280 ha have been fenced off and stocked with animals.&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 04 June 2017" /&gt; Already present in the park are nine species of [[Megaherbivore|large herbivores]] and one [[omnivore]] species: [[Bashkir Pony|Bashkir horse]]s (a strain of ''[[Equus ferus caballus]]'') from the southern part of the Ural Mountains,&lt;ref name="TNF 4 March 14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp Wild Field" /&gt; [[Altai maral]]/[[Altai wapiti]] (''[[Cervus canadensis sibiricus]]''),&lt;ref name="pp Wild Field" /&gt; [[Edilbaevskaya sheep]] (a strain of ''[[Ovis orientalis aries]]''),&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 14 December 2017" /&gt; [[roe deer]] (''[[Capreolus|Capreolus spec.]]''),{{refn|group=note|These are the roe deer of the Tula region, which were already present on the site of Wild Field reserve. The species is not certain, as roe deer were absent in much of European Russia throughout the 20th century and only reoccupied the area in the last decades. Judging by the [[IUCN]] distribution maps,&lt;ref name="IUCN maps roe deer" /&gt; the roe deer of the Tula region should be [[European roe deer]] (''[[Capreolus capreolus]]''), with the westernmost extension of the range of the [[Siberian roe deer]] (''[[Capreolus pygargus]]'') ending approximately 500 km (300 mi) to the east.}}&lt;ref name="pp news 14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp wild field 245" /&gt; [[Kalmyk cattle|Kalmykian cattle]] (a strain of ''[[Bos primigenius taurus]]''),&lt;ref name="zoologist 84" /&gt;&lt;ref name="First Tula Telechannel 3-2015" /&gt; [[Yak#Domesticated yaks|domestic yaks]] (''[[Bos mutus grunniens]]''),&lt;ref name="zoologist 84" /&gt;&lt;ref name="First Tula Telechannel 3-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp news 21" /&gt; [[wild boar]] (''[[Sus scrofa]]''),&lt;ref name="pp news 21" /&gt; one female [[Alces|elk]]&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#91;[[British English|BE]]&amp;#93;&lt;/sup&gt;/[[Alces|moose]]&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#91;[[American English|AE]]&amp;#93;&lt;/sup&gt; (''[[Alces alces]]''),&lt;ref name="pp news 21" /&gt; four [[reindeer]] (''[[Rangifer tarandus]]'')&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 24 May 2017" /&gt; and 73 domestic [[Pridonskaya goat]]s (a strain of ''[[Capra aegagrus hircus]]'').&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 04 June 2017" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4726">'''Polymerase cycling assembly''' (or '''PCA''', also known as '''Assembly PCR''') is a method for the assembly of large [[DNA]] [[oligonucleotide]]s from shorter fragments.  The process uses the same technology as [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], but takes advantage of DNA hybridization and annealing as well as [[DNA polymerase]] to amplify a complete sequence of DNA in a precise order based on the single stranded oligonucleotides used in the process.  It thus allows for the production of [[synthetic gene]]s and even entire synthetic [[genome]]s.

== PCA principles ==
[[Image:PCA polymerase cycling assembly.jpg|right|400px|thumbnail]]Much like how primers are designed such that there is a forward primer and a reverse primer capable of allowing DNA polymerase to fill the entire template sequence, PCA uses the same technology but with multiple oligonucleotides. While in PCR the customary size of oligonuleotides used is 18 base pairs, in PCA lengths of up to 50 are used to ensure uniqueness and correct hybridization.

Each oligonucleotide is designed to be either part of the top or bottom strand of the target sequence. As well as the basic requirement of having to be able to tile the entire target sequence, these oligonucleotides must also have the usual properties of similar melting temperatures, hairpin free, and not too GC rich to avoid the same complications as PCR.

During the polymerase cycles, the oligonucleotides anneal to complementary fragments and then are filled in by polymerase. Each cycle thus increases the length of various fragments randomly depending on which oligonucleotides find each other. It is critical that there is complementarity between all the fragments in some way or a final complete sequence will not be produced as polymerase requires a template to follow.

After this initial construction phase, additional primers encompassing both ends are added to perform a regular PCR reaction, amplifying the target sequence away from all the shorter incomplete fragments. A gel purification can then be used to identify and isolate the complete sequence.

== Typical reaction ==
A typical reaction consists of oligonucleotides ~50 base pairs long each overlapping by about 20 base pairs. The reaction  with all the oligonucleotides is then carried out for ~30 cycles followed by an additional 23 cycles with the end primers.&lt;ref name=Stemmer1&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stemmer|displayauthors=etal|title=Single step assembly of a gene and entire plasmid from large numbers of oligodeoxyribonucleotides|journal=Gene|volume=164|issue=1|year=1995|pages=49–53|doi=10.1016/0378-1119(95)00511-4|pmid=7590320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gibson assembly ==
A modification of this method, [[Gibson assembly]], described by Gibson et al. allows for single-step isothermal assembly of DNA with up to several hundreds [[kilobase|kb]]. By using T5 exonuclease to 'chew back' complementary ends, an overlap of about 40bp can be created. The reaction takes place at 50&amp;nbsp;°C, a temperature where the T5 exonuclease is unstable. After a short timestep it is degraded, the overlaps can anneal and be ligated.&lt;ref name="gibson1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gibson DG, Young L, Chuang RY, Venter JC, Hutchison CA 3rd, Smith HO |year=2009 |title=Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases |journal=Nature Methods |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=343–345 |publisher= |doi=10.1038/nmeth.1318 |pmid=19363495 |pmc= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge University]] [[International Genetically Engineered Machine|IGEM]] team made a video describing the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=WCWjJFU1be8|title=Gibson Assembly video}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ligation independent cloning (LIC) is a new variant of the method for compiling several DNA pieces together and needing only exonuclease enzyme for the reaction. However, the method requires even number of DNA-pieces to be joined together and (usually PCR mediated) synthesis of suitable adapters. LIC cannot thus be regarded as a "non-scarring" sub-cloning method.

'''''Printing and the Mind of Man''''' is a book first published in 1967 and based on an exhibition in 1963. 

'''''PMM''''', as it is usually abbreviated, is regarded as a standard [[Bibliography|bibliographical]] reference, and offers a survey of the impact of [[printing|printed books]] on the development of [[western culture|western civilization]].

The book developed from an exhibition put on at two locations to coincide with the 1963 [[International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition]] (IPEX). At the behest of typographer [[Stanley Morison]] it was decided to put together an exhibition of the contribution printing had made to the enlargement of human knowledge. A display at [[Earls Court]] concentrated on the technical side of printing, while a display at the [[British Museum]] looked more at fine printing. However, both displays had the quite novel intention of promoting the study of books for their role in advancing factual knowledge, rather than for their aesthetics. [[Ian Fleming]], who lent 40 books from his library, was among the private collectors who contributed to the exhibition.

The catalogue, (which might be considered the pre-first edition of ''PMM'') was printed by [[Oxford University Press]], edited by [[John_Carter_(author)|John Carter]], Stanley Morison, Percy H. Muir and others and entitled: ''Catalogue of a display of printing mechanisms and printed materials arranged to illustrate the history of Western civilization and the means of the multiplication of literary texts since the 15th century, organised in connection with the eleventh International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition, under the title Printing and the Mind of Man, assembled at the British Museum and at Earls Court, London, 16–27 July 1963''.

A book-length edition, revised and enlarged, was printed at [[Cambridge University Press]] and published in 1967 by [[Orion Publishing Group|Cassell]] in London and Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston in New York. This first book edition was entitled '''''Printing and the Mind of Man, a descriptive catalogue illustrating the impact of print on the evolution of Western civilization during five centuries'''''. It was edited by John Carter and Percy H. Muir and expanded upon the theme of the impact of printing on human thought.

A second revised edition was published in 1983 by Karl Pressler in [[Munich]] ({{ISBN|3-9800047-3-2}}).

'''''Read More About It''''' was a [[public service announcement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-ark.org.uk/mivana/mediaplayer.php?id=b3ed709abaa8c83f5d2317e93b2f6011&amp;media=cbs-1982-readmoreaboutit&amp;type=mp4 |title=iNTERACTIVE (Beta5-U312010) |publisher=TV ARK |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; campaign created as a joint venture between [[CBS]] and the [[Library of Congress]] that ran from 1980 to 1999 on CBS. The campaign, which usually aired one at the end of a special primetime program, was famous for its opening title sequence, which originally showed a live action TV set which zoomed in using [[stop motion]] that used pages on the side flipping into either the celebrity of the program aired or just on-screen graphics, which was remade in 1990 using [[computer animation]] that used [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for the pages on the side of the TV flipping to revolve to the celebrity/graphics. The spiel in each PSA talks about learning more about what happened in the program, the books the Library of Congress suggests, and that they can be found in their local library or [[bookstore]]. It ended with either the celebrity of the program or an announcer saying, "Visit them. They'll be happy to help you ''Read More About It''." 

Originally the theme music was composed by [[Keith Mansfield]], but in 1983, "Moments of Courage" by composer [[Craig Palmer]] became the theme for the PSAs.  Along with a remade intro came a new theme for the campaign which lasted for the 1990s.  With the arrival of the internet came new resources to learn about the subject of the special or movie aired on CBS and other networks.  Because of this, ''Read More About It'' was succeeded at the turn of the 21st century by the ''[[CBS Cares]]'' campaign, which like its predecessor usually airs at the end of either a movie (example: ''[[The Karen Carpenter Story]]'') (until 2010) or a special program (example: The [[Grammy Awards]] or the [[Super Bowl]]) and focuses primarily on resources, online and print, to learn about the event or subject featured in the preceding program or community involvement.

[[File:Lindos4.svg|thumb|400px|right]]

The '''Robinson–Dadson curves''' are one of many sets of [[equal-loudness contours]] for the [[human ear]], determined experimentally by D. W. Robinson and R. S. Dadson, and reported in a paper entitled "A re-determination of the equal-loudness relations for pure tones" in Br. J. Appl. Phys. 7, 166-181 (1956).

Until recently, it was common to see the term '[[Fletcher–Munson curves|Fletcher–Munson]]' used to refer to equal-loudness contours generally, even though the re-determination carried out by Robinson and Dadson in 1956, became the basis for an ISO standard ISO 226 which was only revised recently.

It is now better to use the term '[[Equal-loudness contours]]' as the generic term, especially as a recent survey by ISO redefined the curves in a new standard, ISO 226 :2003.

According to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] report, the Robinson-Dadson results were the odd one out, differing more from the current standard than did the [[Fletcher–Munson curves]]. It comments that it is fortunate that the 40-Phon Fletcher-Munson curve on which the [[A-weighting]] standard was based turns out to have been in good agreement with modern determinations.

The article also comments on the large differences apparent in the low-frequency region, which remain unexplained. Possible explanations are:

* The equipment used was not properly calibrated.
* The criteria used for judging equal loudness (which is tricky) differed.
* Different races actually vary greatly in this respect (possible, and most recent determinations were by the Japanese).
* Subjects were not properly rested for days in advance, or were exposed to loud noise in travelling to the tests which tensed the tensor timpani and stapedius muscles controlling low-frequency mechanical coupling.

[[File:SaganWalk.Map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Planet Walk]]
The Sciencenter's '''Sagan Planet Walk''' is a walkable [[solar system model|scale model]] of the [[Solar System]], located in [[Ithaca, New York]]. The model scales the entire Solar System—both planet size and distances between them—down to one five billionth of its actual size. Consisting of eleven obelisks situated along a {{Convert|1.18|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on|sp=us}} path through the streets of downtown Ithaca, the Planet Walk leads from the [[Sun]] at [[Ithaca Commons|Center Ithaca]] to Pluto at the [[sciencenter|Ithaca Sciencenter]]. 

The exhibition was originally created in 1997 in memory of Ithaca resident and [[Cornell]] Professor [[Carl Sagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sagan Planet Walk|url=http://www.sciencenter.org/SaganPW/|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Ithaca Sciencenter|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205135839/http://www.sciencenter.org/saganpw/|archivedate=5 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the model was expanded {{Convert|4740|mi|km|abbr=out|disp=flip|sp=us}} to include a representation of [[Alpha Centauri]], the Sun's closest neighboring star, at the ‘[[Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawaii|Imiloa Astronomy Center at the University of Hawaii]]. The addition of the Alpha Centauri Obelisk made it the world's largest exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Couillard|first=Sherri|title=Sagan Planet Walk Expands to Hawaii|url=http://cornellsun.com/node/53167|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Cornell Daily Sun|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311192420/http://cornellsun.com/node/53167|archivedate=11 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Susan|title=Sagan Planet Walk, now the world's largest exhibition, extends to Hawai'i|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Sept12/PlanetWalk.html|work=Chronicle Online|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the inner planets and Sun were removed as part of extensive construction being done to the [[Ithaca Commons]], but have since been replaced. In 2015, a grant was approved to further expand the exhibition by installing an exoplanet [[Kepler-37d]] station on the Moon {{Convert|238900|mi|km|abbr=out|sp=us|disp=flip}} away.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tompkinscountyny.gov/files/tourism/4_15_15_STPB_agenda_PACKET_full.pdf|title=Tompkins County Strategic Tourism Planning Board|last=|first=|date=April 15, 2015|website=Tompkins County NY|publisher=|access-date=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual models==
The scaled size of the Sun is given by a {{Convert|27.8|cm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}} diameter circular frame repeated at the top of each {{Convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=on|sp=us}} tall obelisk. Centered within each sun-sized frame, the proportional size of each planet is represented by a small sphere affixed in a glass window. All of the original planet locations were chosen not only for accuracy to scale but also to highlight local landmarks and public spaces within Ithaca. However, since the original installation of the Planet Walk the public library has moved to a new location, leaving Saturn no longer attached to a local landmark. Additionally, as of 2016-2017, the original planets in plexiglass at each station have been replaced by simple yellow disks with the planet simply represented by a relatively-sized hole.  Some attendant moons are now represented by tiny holes in the disks.

===The Sun===
The Sun Obelisk is located in the center of the [[Ithaca Commons]], a pedestrian shopping area in the heart of downtown Ithaca. The round window representing the size of the Sun at this station is roughly the size of a basketball and, in this obelisk only, contains no glass. All the subsequent obelisks in the Solar system model have Sun-sized glass windows containing their respective planets for the sake of comparison.

===The Inner Planets===
The obelisks for the four inner planets are all contained within the commons area stretching north towards Seneca Street. Mercury is situated to scale about {{Convert|12.7|yd|m|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=off}} away from the Sun, Venus another {{Convert|10|yd|m|abbr=off|adj=off|sp=us}} away, Earth another {{Convert|9.3|yd|m|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=off}} away, and Mars another {{Convert|17.1|yd|m|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=off}} away. This keeps the four inner planets within eyesight of the Sun, yet the representations of each planet appear quite small within their glass windows, and can even be somewhat hard to see. The contrast between the size of the Sun and the size of the inner planets coupled with the visible distance between them illustrate the vastness and emptiness of space.

=== The Asteroid Belt ===
[[File:SaganWalk.4.5.AsteroidBelt.jpg|thumb|right|The Asteroid Belt]]
Once leaving the inner planets, a visitor to the Planet Walk turns west along Seneca Street to continue towards Jupiter. Between Mars and Jupiter lies the asteroid belt. The obelisk representing the asteroid belt was added several years after the initial installation. Its display contains the only public, unguarded meteorite in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nocella|first=Michael|title=When Big Is Walkable: Sciencenter’s Sagan Planet Walk|url=http://www.ithaca.com/visit_ithaca/article_cd5c7c46-b57f-11e1-8585-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Ithaca Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jupiter===
The Jupiter Obelisk sits at the corner of Seneca and Cayuga streets, outside the downtown Dewitt Mall, and not far from the famed [[Moosewood Restaurant]]. The model of Jupiter within the glass window is the first planet representation on the walk that is easily visible, demonstrating how much bigger than the inner planets it is.

===Saturn===
To reach the Saturn Obelisk, visitors turn north and continue along Cayuga street. At the corner of Cayuga and Court street, Saturn's obelisk sits outside the former location of the [[Tompkins County Public Library]]. The rings of Saturn are clearly visible within the circular window.

===Uranus===
Visitors continue northward along Cayuga street from Saturn, reaching the obelisk for Uranus just across Cascadilla Creek at the entrance to Thompson Park.

===Neptune and the Carl Sagan Bridge===
[[File:SaganWalk.8.5.Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The Carl Sagan Bridge with planet symbols]]
From Uranus, visitors follow Willow Avenue northwest and cross the Carl Sagan bridge at Adams street to reach the Neptune Obelisk. The Carl Sagan Bridge, built in 2000, features nine circular windows adorned with the signs of the nine planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brand|first=David|title=Cornell undergrads salute Sagan and technology by building bridge from new, lightweight material|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Nov99/petrina.fibers.deb.html|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Cornell News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obelisk for Neptune is located just across the bridge in Conley Park.

===Pluto and the Sciencenter===
The Planet Walk was conceived and built prior to Pluto losing its planetary status in 2006, and the model includes the Pluto Obelisk, which is located just outside the Sciencenter on First street.

===Alpha Centauri===
The model was expanded {{Convert|4740|mi|km|abbr=out|disp=flip|sp=us}} in 2012 to include [[Alpha Centauri]], the star closest to the Sun. The Alpha Centauri Obelisk is exhibited at the ‘[[Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawaii|‘Imiloa Astronomy Center of Hawai‘i]] at the [[University of Hawaii]] in Hilo, Hawaii. This extension made the Sagan Planet Walk the world's largest exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Couillard|first=Sherri|title=Sagan Planet Walk Expands to Hawaii|url=http://cornellsun.com/node/53167|accessdate=19 November 2012|work=Cornell Daily Sun|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311192420/http://cornellsun.com/node/53167|archivedate=11 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Susan|title=Sagan Planet Walk, now the world's largest exhibition, extends to Hawai'i|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Sept12/PlanetWalk.html|work=Chronicle Online|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models inspired by the Sagan Planet Walk==
The Sagan Planet Walk has inspired the creation of other scale-model Solar Systems in the United States.
*The [http://loopplanetwalk.com/ Delmar Loop Planet Walk] in St. Louis, Missouri:

SIDE explains the effects of anonymity and identifiability on group behavior. It has become one of several [[theories of technology]] that describe social effects of [[computer-mediated communication]].

The SIDE model provides an alternative explanation for effects of anonymity and other "deindividuating" factors that classic [[deindividuation]] theory&lt;ref name="Diener"&gt;Diener, E. (1980).

The [[Social identity theory|social identity]] model of deindividuation effects (or SIDE model) is a theory developed in [[social psychology]] and communication studies. SIDE explains the effects of [[anonymity]] and identifiability on group behavior. It has become one of several theories examining technology that describe social effects of [[Computer-mediated communication|computer-mediated]] communication. With advancing technology it is becoming increasingly researched what the effects of having the control of being incognito on the web, and also having profiles that represent ones person is doing to relationships and communication in our lives. The SIDE model provides an alternative explanation for effects of [[anonymity]] and other "deindividuating" factors that classic deindividuation theory cannot adequately explain. To understand the model of deindividuation, it is described by scholarly articles as "the situation in which individuals act in groups and do not see themselves as individuals, thereby facilitating antinormative behavior"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Kyung Kyu|last2=Lee|first2=Ae Ri|last3=Lee|first3=Un-Kon|date=July 2018|title=Impact of anonymity on roles of personal and group identities in online communities|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378720618302490|journal=Information &amp; Management|doi=10.1016/j.im.2018.07.005|issn=0378-7206}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

== Background ==

SIDE developed as a critique of deindividuation theory. Deindividuation theory was developed to explain the phenomenon that in crowds, people become capable of acts that rational individuals would not normally endorse (see also [[Crowd psychology]]). In the crowd, so it would seem, humans become disinhibited and behave anti-normatively. Early versions of deindividuation theory&lt;ref name="Zimbardo" /&gt; saw this as a consequence of reduced self-awareness and accountability. Diener&lt;ref name="Diener" /&gt; and others later focused more exclusively on loss of self as the core psychological process underlying deindividuation.

Reicher&lt;ref name="Reicher1982"&gt;Reicher, S.D. (1982)  The determination of collective behaviour.  In Tajfel (Ed.) Social Identity and Intergroup Relations  Cambridge, CUP, and Paris, Maison des Sciences de l'Homme.&lt;/ref&gt; criticized deindividuation theory for several reasons. Among others, historical evidence and case studies strongly suggested that the psychological process proposed by deindividuation theory (a loss of self) did not occur in the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;McPhail, C. (1991). ''The myth of the madding crowd.'' New York: de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] of empirical deindividuation research confirmed there was no consistent empirical evidence for the processes it proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Postmes, T., &amp; Spears, R. (1998). Deindividuation and anti-normative behavior: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin, 123'', 238–259.&lt;/ref&gt; To the contrary: anonymity and reduced self-awareness enhanced sensitivity to local norms. SIDE researchers concluded that there is no good empirical support for the process of deindividuation, and factors that should produce deindividuation have highly variable effects on behavior.&lt;ref name="SIMoDP"&gt;Reicher, S., Spears, R., &amp; Postmes, T. (1995). A social identity model of deindividuation phenomena. European Review of Social Psychology, 6, 161–198.&lt;/ref&gt; To account for this, SIDE proposes that there are no blanket indiscriminate effects of anonymity, but that anonymity effects are influenced by, and can only be understood through, their interaction with the social context.

Reicher&lt;ref name="Reicher1982" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reicher, S. (1987). Crowd behaviour as social action. In J. C. Turner, M. A. Hogg, P. J. Oakes, S. Reicher &amp; M. S. Wetherell (Eds.), ''Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;171–202). Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; also challenged the conceptualization of deindividuation as a loss of self. This process assumes that individuals have a unitary self-concept that they can be more or less aware of.  Reicher and others argued that individuals do not have a unitary sense of self. [[Social identity theory]], for instance, points out that one's sense of self is made up of personal identity and multiple social identities, all of which combine to shape one's personality.  Social identities are likely to become the basis for self-definition when that social identity is salient, such as when making comparisons between "them" and "us".  One consequence of salience is "depersonalization". Note that in research on social identity, depersonalization is not the same as deindividuation or a loss of self (cf. the entry on [[Depersonalization]] to read up on what it is not).  In social identity research, the term depersonalization refers to a switch to a group level of self-categorization in which self and others are seen in terms of their group identities.

According to [[self-categorization theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S., &amp; Wetherell, M. S. (1987). ''Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory.'' Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; depersonalization makes perceptions of the outgroup more stereotypical.  Self-perceptions also shift: self and other ingroup members become interchangeable, and the individual self-stereotypes in terms of group attributes. Depersonalization thus transforms individuals into group members who regulate their behavior according to in-group norms. Importantly, and in contrast to deindividuation, the psychological state of depersonalization does not imply a loss of rationality or behavioural disinhibition; rather, the individual behaves rationally and regulates behaviour according to ingroup standards.  These ideas from social identity theory and self-categorization theory provided not only key ingredients for Reicher's critique of deindividuation theory, they are also the foundations upon which SIDE was modelled.

== Development ==

The model was first named by Lea and Spears&lt;ref name="LeaSpears1991"&gt;Lea, M., &amp; Spears, R. (1991). Computer-mediated communication, de-individuation and group decision-making. ''International Journal of Man Machine Studies, 34'', 283–301.&lt;/ref&gt; and later developed in a series of publications.&lt;ref&gt;Lea, M., &amp; Spears R. (1992). Paralanguage and social perception in computer-mediated communication. ''Journal of Organizational Computing'', ''2'', 321–341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PostmesSpearsLea1998"&gt;Postmes, T., Spears, R., &amp; Lea, M. (1998). Breaching or building social boundaries? SIDE-effects of computer-mediated communication. ''Communication Research'', ''25'', 689–715.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SpearsLea1994"&gt;Spears, R., &amp; Lea, M. (1994). Panacea or panopticon? The hidden power in computer-mediated communication. ''Communication Research'', ''21,'' 427–459.&lt;/ref&gt; The SIDE model took Reicher's ideas about the crowd, and applied and extended them to [[computer-mediated communication]]. Early research in this domain suggested that, similar to deindividuation theory, users of online computer were prone to flaming and other disinhibitions due to a reduction in social cues.&lt;ref&gt;Kiesler, S., Siegel, J., &amp; McGuire, T. W. (1984). Social psychological aspects of computer-mediated communication. ''American Psychologist, 39,'' 1123–1134.&lt;/ref&gt; The SIDE model was developed, in first instance, to account for contradictory effects of social cues in online groups. SIDE thus assumed that effects in the crowd and in online environments showed some similar properties.

The first comprehensive statement of SIDE was by Reicher, Spears, &amp; Postmes.&lt;ref name="SIMoDP" /&gt; According to SIDE, a [[social identity approach]] can account for many of the effects observed in [[deindividuation]] research and in [[crowd psychology]], as well as in [[computer-mediated communication]].  For example, deindividuation has been found to foster group identification and to induce greater opinion polarization in small groups communicating online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Eun-Ju|title=Deindividuation Effects on Group Polarization in Computer-Mediated Communication: The Role of Group Identification, Public-Self-Awareness, and Perceived Argument Quality|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2007|volume=57|issue=2|page=385|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00348.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to understand effects of factors such as anonymity and reduced cues on group behavior, one needs to take the social and inter-group context into account.  SIDE argues that anonymity and social context in interaction have cognitive and strategic consequences.

== Cognitive SIDE ==

Group immersion and anonymity have cognitive consequences that affect the relative salience of personal and social identities.  These factors do not produce a loss of self as proposed by [[deindividuation]] theory.  Rather, anonymity and immersion in the group can enhance the [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]] of social identity and thereby depersonalize social perceptions of others and the self.  SIDE argues this occurs principally because (visual) anonymity obscures individual features and interpersonal differences.  As a result of the decreased visibility of the individual within anonymous groups, the process of depersonalization is accentuated, and cognitive efforts to perceive the group as an entity are amplified.  Provided that there is some basis to perceive self and others as members of one group, anonymity therefore enhances the salience of the shared [[social identity]].  The net result is that people will tend to perceive self and others in terms of stereotypic group features, and are influenced accordingly.&lt;ref name="PostmesSpearsLea1998" /&gt;

It is important to note that anonymity does not automatically or mechanically influence the salience of social identities.  An individual can be identified in such a way that it promotes a more individuated person-perception or alternatively that it promotes a stronger social categorization. In a few instances, making the individual more identifiable may strengthen social categorization. This may happen particularly in contexts within which these social categories are potentially meaningful and therefore accessible, and when group memberships are visually clearly identifiable (as is the case for gender, certain racial characteristics, disabilities, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Spears, R., Postmes, T., Lea, M., &amp; Wolbert, A. (2002). The power of influence and the influence of power in virtual groups: A SIDE look at CMC and the Internet. ''The Journal of Social Issues, 58,'' 91–108.&lt;/ref&gt;).

SIDE thus describes the cognitive process by which the salience of social identity is affected by the absence or presence of individuating information.  It is important to note that this process can only operate to the extent that some sense of groupness exists from the outset.  If individuals interact anonymously in the absence of any specific social identity or group boundaries, anonymity would have the reverse effect of accentuating one’s isolation from the group or by further obscuring group boundaries.&lt;ref name="LeaSpears1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postmes, T., Spears, R., Sakhel, K., &amp; De Groot, D. (2001). Social influence in computer-mediated communication: The effects of anonymity on group behavior. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', ''27,'' 1242–1254.&lt;/ref&gt;  Juxtaposing the two possibilities, anonymity in the group either has the effect of amplifying a shared social identity that, however rudimentary, is already in place, or it can amplify the individual independence which exists in contexts in which no shared identity is available.  The latter process, whereby anonymity provides the opportunities for people to express and develop identities independent of the social influence of the group, is further elaborated in the Strategic SIDE.

== Strategic SIDE ==

Anonymity also has strategic consequences: it affects the ability to express personal and social identities.&lt;ref name="SpearsLea1994" /&gt; Strategic concerns come into play when an out-group has more power than the ingroup, and where the norms of both groups are at odds with each other.  In such cases, the identifiability of ingroup members towards the outgroup will shift the power balance between groups: identifiability towards a more powerful outgroup limits the degree to which the ingroup's identity can be expressed freely and without sanction on those dimensions where ingroup norms conflict with out-group standards and values, and which are punishable or otherwise sanctionable. Conversely, anonymity towards a more powerful outgroup may be a convenient instrument for the ingroup to express itself on those same dimensions.

The strategic SIDE thus proposes that anonymity may be "used" by less powerful groups to express aspects of their identity. This may appear to be similar to the effects that anonymity has for [[accountability]] in classic [[deindividuation]] theory. However, unlike deindividuation theory, SIDE takes account of the inter-group context within which identifiability and anonymity occur.  By implication, a loss of accountability does not result in the disinhibited or random anti-normative behaviour of individuals that deindividuation theory is concerned with.  Rather, according to SIDE, anonymity affects the ability for a group to express its identity, and thus to engage in targeted and ingroup normative behaviour, thereby changing power relations between groups.  The close connection between identity expression and power proposed by SIDE may explain the patterned and targeted behaviour of crowds whose violent actions (if they occur) are very often symbolic, not random.&lt;ref name="SIMoDP" /&gt;

In addition to anonymity between groups, SIDE also considers strategic effects of anonymity within groups. Here, SIDE has particularly explored the consequences of anonymity (as well as isolation) from other ingroup members: On the one hand this deprives individual group members of social support from their fellows, and this may hinder their ability to express their ingroup identity in the face of a powerful and unsympathetic outgroup. On the other hand, the knowledge that other ingroup members are unable to identify the self may have consequences for (in particular) low identifiers to feel less committed to ingroup norms.

==Applications==

Today, SIDE is used to explain the effects of anonymity and social isolation in various contexts. Research on SIDE has particularly focused on crowds and collective action,&lt;ref&gt;Chan, M. (2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7886">'''Sociomapping''' is a method developed for [[data analysis|processing]] and [[Information visualization|visualization]] of relational data (e.g. social network data). It is most commonly used for mapping the social structure within small teams (10-25 people). Sociomapping uses the landscape metaphor to display complex multi-dimensional data in a 3D [[map]], where individual objects are localized in such way that their distance on the map corresponds to their distance in the underlying data.

Thanks to its visual coding Sociomapping engages our evolved skills for [[spatial orientation]] and [[movement detection]], thus making the interpretation of complex data easy and accessible for everyone.

==History==
The sociomapping method was developed in 1993-1994 by R. Bahbouh as a tool that would facilitate understanding of data about social relations and help preventing conflicts within teams of military professionals. The first major application of sociomapping took place in 1994-1995 during the HUBES experiment (Human Behavior in Extended Spaceflight) – a 135-day-long simulation of a spaceflight with three crew members organized by [[European Space Agency]]. Sociomapping was then regularly used in other spaceflight simulations (1995-1996: EKOPSY, 1999: Mars105, 2010-2012: [[Mars500]]). Since 2005, sociomapping has been extensively used in business environment to analyze relationships within senior management teams. In 2012, C. Höschl jr. developed Real Time Sociomapping®
software that enables customers to do team sociomapping on the spot and is used for commercial purposes.

==Basic principle==
The basic principle of Sociomapping is transforming original data concerning a set of objects in such a way that the distance of each pair of objects on the map corresponds to the distance between the two objects in the underlying data. Transformation of the data is a matter of 1) choosing some metric that could be reasonably interpreted as distance, and 2) translating the multi-dimensional distance matrix into 2D coordinate system so that the correlation between map-distances and data-distances is maximized. 
The algorithm for data-transformation, developed by C. Höschl jr., is thus a [[Dimensionality reduction|dimensionality-reduction]] technique, such as [[Principal component analysis|PCA]], and its goodness of fit can be measured by [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient|Spearman correlation]] between the map-distances and data-distances. 
Sociomapping takes into account that, particularly in case of social relations, relational data may be asymmetrical (e.g. John like Mary more than she likes him) and preserves this information by mapping the objects in such a way that for each object the closest other object is the one closest to it according to the metric of choice in the underlying data, and so on for other objects ordered by distance.

==Application==
There are two main areas of application for Sociomapping – groups (small systems) and populations (large systems). For each area a different method of visualization and data transformation is used in order to facilitate people’s ability to understand and interpret the analyzed data.

===Groups and small systems===
Sociomapping for small systems produces Sociomaps of subjects. These subjects (in most cases people) are placed on the Sociomap reflecting their distance measured in various ways:
* [[social distance]]
* psychological distance (psychological similarity)
* communication distance
* other relation measures

Besides the distances between the group members, Sociomap shows additional variable coded in the height (or color) of the subject. Typical variables used for the height are: social status, [[Key performance indicators|performance indicators]] of the subjects, average communication frequency, etc.

Understanding the relative distances between the people helps to understand the structure of the group, find subgroups formed by groups members and discover functions of the group members. In connection to the height Sociomap enables complex and comprehensive insight into the groups and small systems.

Sociomapping of small systems produces similar results to [[social network analysis]] with additional visualization features.

===Profile analysis===
Besides the small systems analysis based on various relational data, Sociomapping can be used to visualize the profiles of unrelated subjects. This is done by transformation of profiles of the subjects, computing the distances between the profiles and visualizing them in a Sociomap.
There is a software to compute Profile analysis (see section Sociomapping software)

===Populations and large systems===
For large systems and populations, different type of Sociomaps is used. Data used for these type of maps are rectangular [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], where for each subject there is a [[preference vector]] of selected objects (such as [[political parties]], [[brands]], [[Product (business)|products]], and so on). 
In order to create a Sociomap, for each subject a position in the map is determined, and a small piece of mass representing this subject is placed on the map according to its vector of preferences to an object.  As a result, there are places on the Sociomap where more subject are placed (hills) and where there are no subject (valleys). Therefore, hills are formed on the places representing typical preference configurations and this allows for visual cluster analysis, or segmentation.
In this sense, Large systems Sociomapping is a [[data mining]] approach based on visual [[pattern recognition]]).

Typical uses for Large systems Sociomapping are:
* [[Political science|political research]] (preferences and polls)
* [[marketing research]] (attitudes and product preferences)
* [[customer segmentation]] (behavioral patterns)
* and other research concerned with preferences and/or attitudes.

==Broader scope of application==
Sociomapping has broader scope of application, including the following fields:

*Historical events analysis (e.g.  [[RMS Titanic]] survival rate)
*[[Internet community]] tools (e.g.  [[Last.fm]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20081219081705/http://qed-portal.com/en/last_fm/tool/] profile similarity)
*[[Literature]] analysis (e.g.  analysis of communication in [[Shakespeare plays]])
*[[Military]] units and [[human spaceflight]] crews analysis
*[[Sport]] analysis and forecast (e.g. cooperation of sport teams)
*[[Politics]] analysis and forecast

=== Spiritism and Spiritualism ===
At the beginning of the first chapter Hartmann explains that "the word '[[Spiritism]]' is of French production" but the English, and most part of the Germans prefer the term "Spiritualism." The author presents to use the term [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|"Spiritualism"]] to denote the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] point of view, which is the opposite of [[materialism]], and the explanation of [[Mediumship|mediumistic]] phenomena through participation of "[[spirit]]s", he offers to call by the term "Spiritism." {{sfn|Hartmann|2012|p=1}}{{refn|group=note|"Spiritualism is a religion based upon the belief that mediumship, the ability demonstrated by a few select persons to contact the world of spirits, proves that the individual survives bodily death. It arose in midnineteenth-century America and has spread around the world."{{sfn|Melton|2014|p=118}}}} He believes that most people, who are aspiring for Spiritism and read Spiritist journals, have no interest in a scientific study of the phenomena of mediumship, but instead seek "the confirmation of their belief in [[Afterlife|immortality]]."{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1p=2|Treitel|2004|2p=14}}{{refn|group=note|History of "[[table-turning]]" in Germany began "in January 1853 when a woman in Bremen" received from New York a letter by her brother in which he, having reported on his successful spiritualistic experiments, suggested to her to conduct hers own experiments, in accordance with the detailed instructions attached to the letter. A few days later, in the salon belonging to the Bremen businessman, one of the first spiritualistic [[séance]]s in Europe was held.{{sfn|Treitel|2004|p=30}}}} Hartmann considers a reopening of the huge field of phenomena, that were rejected in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], as a great merit of the modern spiritistic movement. However, in his opinion, Spiritism threatens to become a public disaster in Germany, therefore the state should use its authority in order to interest scientists in a study of the spiritistic phenomena. He writes that the public has the complete right to know about these things, and since it is not able to formulate its own opinion, it only remains to wait for the conclusions drawn by the official representatives of science.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1pp=14, 15, 20|Treitel|2004|2pp=14, 15|Doyle|2013|3p=183}}{{refn|group=note|[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] stated that, in accordance with the Hartmann philosophy, "the [[soul|ego]] survives death as a discarnate entity against a background of... Christian theology, and spiritualist speculations."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1993|p=23}}}}{{refn|group=note|[[Frank Podmore]] wrote that the immature views of the first American Spiritualists were "transmuted and elaborated by European, and especially by German thinkers [including Hartmann]," who have leaded the phenomena into rank of scientific facts "by postulating new forces or new extensions of familiar forces, resident in the human organism, rather than to be content with adopting an explanation which is practically the negation of all explanations—the operations of spirits."{{sfn|Podmore|2011|p=162}}}}

=== Research methodology ===
Hartmann writes that in order to study the [[Paranormal|"abnormal phenomena of human nature"]] it is necessary to appeal to persons who are endowed with an abnormal organism. It should be remembered, he continues, that just as in "experiments with an electrical friction machine", there may be failures in experiments with mediums, but this should not prevent the "investigation of abnormal phenomena." He believes that the scientific study of spiritism should be based on "general methodological axioms" which can not be "transgressed with impunity."{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1pp=4, 112|Карышев|1895|2p=27}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"First, principles are not to be multiplied without necessity; thus a second sort of causes are not to be supposed, as long as a single sort will suffice. Secondly, we should as long as possible abide by causes whose existence is guaranteed by experience or indubitable inference, and should not unnecessarily catch at causes of doubtful or unproven existence, such as are to be first established by their value as hypothesis for the explanation of phenomena in question. Thirdly, we should as long as possible try to do with natural causes and not touch supernatural ones without urgent necessity. Against these three axioms Spiritism offends."{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1pp=112–3|Aksakow|1894a|2pp=333–4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hypothesis of hallucinations ===
The study of "masked [[somnambulism]]," as Hartmann argues, can give an understanding of the "whole area" of mediumistic phenomena.{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|p=31}}{{refn|group=note|"'''Somnambulism''', a state of sleep, or half-waking trance, spontaneously or artificially induced in which subconscious faculties take the place of normal consciousness and direct the body in the performance of erratic (sleep walking) or highly intellectual actions (solving problems)."{{sfn|Fodor|1966a}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Massey, facts of somnambulism in respect to mediumistic phenomena "have certainly been too much neglected by Spiritualists."{{sfn|Massey|2012|p=xi}} Du Prel wrote that somnambulism is "the most convincing proof" of the existence of supersensible world, since it shows that subconsciously "we have intertwined" with this transcendental world. Somnambulism proves that "[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and Hartmann were right," when they asserted that the will and the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] compose basis for the phenomenon of man.{{sfnm|Du Prel|1889|1p=189|Du Prel|2012a|2p=166}}}} He explains that an "universal medium must be more than autosomnambule; he must be at the same time a powerful [[Animal magnetism|magnetiser]]." In his opinion, on a spiritistic [[séance]] medium plunges itself into a state of "masked or open somnambulism." Further, such a medium-autosomnambule has hallucinations, considered by him for reality, and at the same time, he possesses a strong desire that those present should see this imaginary reality, i.e. would have the same hallucinatory ideas as he himself.{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1p=32|Аксаков|1910|2pp=269–71}}

Hartmann believes that "from the scientific psychological standpoint" every participator of mediumistic séance must constantly think on himself that he is under the influence of a very powerful [[Animal magnetism|mesmerist]] who aims to immerse him in masked somnambulism and thus taint him with his hallucinations.{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1p=53|Аксаков|1910|2p=277}}{{refn|group=note|Hartmann explains mediumistic phenomena "psychologically in terms of hidden mental powers." He argues that medium is "a powerful mesmerist, capable of... creating a shared hallucination."{{sfn|Wolffram|2009|p=42}}}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The mediums in their state of masked or open somnambulism have a size of nerve force, be it self-produced or extracted and accumulated by those present, as no magnetiser in his waking state has made it unfold, so surely theirs ability must with the help of this superior quantity of force to put those present in a state of open or masked somnambulism, greater than that of any magnetiser acting in the awake state."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=55|Aksakow|1894a|2p=309}}{{refn|group=note|According to Hartmann, the existence of a "mediumistic nerve force", which, he writes, is "mistakenly" called a psychic one, is a fact.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=111|Аксаков|1910|2p=668}}}}{{hidden|Original text (in German)|Die Medien in ihrem larvirten oder offenen Somnambulismus über ein Maass von Nervenkraft, sei es selbstproducirter, sei es von den Anwesenden extrahirter und angesammelter, verfügen, wie noch kein Magnetiseur im ganz wachen Zustand es zur Entfaltung gebracht hat, so gewiss muss auch ihre Fähigkeit, mit Hilfe dieses überlegenen Kraftquantums die Anwesenden in einen Zustand von offenem oder larvirtem Somnambulismus zu versetzen, grösser sein als die irgend eines im wachen Zustand agirenden Magnetiseurs.|headerstyle=background:#DDDDDD}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Hartmann, the waking will of the medium in the somnambulic state fulfills the function of a magnetiser, giving the somnambulic consciousness a certain direction in relation to emerging hallucinations. If a medium "has the hallucination" of no longer being itself but of being the "spirit of [[Katie King (spirit)|Katie King]]," for example, and of appearing as such, the hallucination will also be transmitted to the recipients, that the medium who emerges from the curtain really is "Katie King."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=95|Аксаков|1910|2p=272}} He believes that materialisation is most often just a transfiguration of medium himself,{{refn|group=note|"'''Transfiguration''', metamorphic power of the medium to assume bodily characteristics of deceased people for their representation."{{sfn|Fodor|1966b}}}} because when the phantom was separating from the medium it always appeared that it was completely coming from the medium and returning to him.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=110|Аксаков|1910|2p=669}}{{refn|group=note|Hartmann tries to refer to "cases of hallucination-transference" that took place among "Indian fakirs and Turkish dervishes,"{{sfn|Hartmann|2012|p=89}} however, according to [[William Walker Atkinson|Ramacharaka]], although the images materialized "from the air" by fakirs are similar to those that are observed in spiritualistic séances, "there is really no connection between the two classes of phenomena."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=310}}}}

The hallucinatory hypothesis by Hartmann rejects the possibility of obtaining photographs on which both the medium and the materialised figure would be simultaneously placed, since hallucination can not be photographed, thus, in the opinion of its author, all such photographs are fake.{{sfn|Вагнер|1889|p=lii}} For example, about a photograph taken by [[William Crookes]], on which can seen the medium simultaneously with the phantom, Hartmann writes that it is exposed to the strong suspicion that "instead of the supposed phantom the medium, and instead of the supposed medium the dress of the medium, stuffed with a cushion in a half-concealed position, have been photographed."{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1p=93|Аксаков|1910|2p=238}}{{refn|group=note|[[Helena Blavatsky]] wrote: "Man can create. Given a certain intensity of will, and the shapes created by the mind become subjective. Hallucinations, they are called, although to their creator they are real as any visible object is to any one else. Given a more intense and intelligent concentration of this will, and the form becomes concrete, visible, objective."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1877|p=62}}}}

=== Hypothesis of nerve force ===
According to Hartmann, any physical phenomena of mediumship, regardless of their complexity, are always fulfilled due to "mediumistic nerve force,"{{sfn|Carrington|1907|p=367}}{{sfn|Melton|2001b}} which is nothing else than a physical force that is "produced" by medium's nervous system and passes unhindered through any substance, "like magnetism."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=50|Aksakow|1894a|2p=156}}{{refn|group=note|"Hartmann explained the physical phenomena as due to some force analogous to electricity or magnetism emanating from the medium's body."{{sfn|Podmore|2011|p=162}}}} The medium's will must direct this force and control the one, and the distribution of the one depends on the "fantastic image that is in the somnambulistic conscious of the medium." In addition, physical phenomena that require "a special strain of nerve force" are occurring when mediums sink into "an open somnambulism."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1pp=31, 51|Aksakow|1894a|2pp=221, 317}} The author confirms that the imprints of organic forms belong to "the most striking phenomena" of mediumship—they had been surpassed only cases of "matter's penetration through matter." He admits that the imprints undoubtedly prove that in this case there is no transfer of hallucinations but "an objective-real impact of mediumistic force on matter,"{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=52|Аксаков|1910|2p=132}} and explains this phenomenon as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If we imagine another arrangement of the pressure and tension lines of the mediumistic nerve force—an arrangement corresponding to those pressures that are produced by inner side of the flat laying hand on a soft substance capable of perceiving the imprint, then the movement of the particles of matter caused by such a dynamical system should again be consistented with that, which is caused by direct pressure of the hand, i.e. imprint of an organic form would have been obtained, although such a form, capable of producing such imprint, might not has been in material kind."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=50|Aksakow|1894a|2p=154}}{{refn|group=note|This passage of the philosopher was commented by Aksakov as follows, "This explanation contains a number of impossibilities from the point of view of physics."{{sfn|Aksakow|1894a|p=154}}}}{{hidden|Original text (in German)|Denkt man sich eine andre Anordung der Druck- und Zuglinien der mediumistischen Nervenkraft, entsprechend denjenigen Druckverhältnissen, welche die Innenseite einer flach ausgestreckten Hand auf einen eindrucksfähigen Stoff hervorbringt, so müsste die Verschiebung der Stofftheilchen, welche durch ein solches dynamisches System hervorgebracht würde, wiederum mit der durch den Druck der Hand hervorgebrachten übereinstimmen, d. h. den Abdruck einer organischen Form zeigen, ohne dass eine organische Form in materieller Gestalt vorhanden gewesen wäre, welche diesen Abdruck hervorgebracht hätte.|headerstyle=background:#DDDDDD}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the phenomena Hartmann explains by the fact that medium in a state of somnambulism allegedly combines "the hallucination of the emerging image" with the idea on the need to move a real object and unconsciously produces this [[Psychokinesis|displacement]] "with the help of his mediumistic nerve force," while remaining confident that it was performed by own force of the fantastic image that has appeared by him, that is, through the "transfer of his hallucination to the audience," he unconsciously inspires them with the idea that the displacement that occurred really was fulfilled by that ghost which is just his hallucination.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=102|Аксаков|1910|2p=127}}{{refn|group=note|Aksakov commented, "So, we have here a hallucination with additive of the nerve force."{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=127}}}}{{refn|group=note|Ramacharaka wrote that many of the so-called spiritistic phenomena are actually produced by "the unconscious [[astral projection]] of medium," and not by incorporeal beings, staying on other [[Plane (esotericism)|planes of existence]].{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=323}}}}

=== Mental manifestations ===
Regarding spiritistic messages, Hartmann argues that only "the somnambulistic consciousness" can be the source of their content. He writes, "All messages have a content corresponding to the mental level and views of the medium." As a rule, this level happens to be "below the spiritual level" of the medium and participants of the séance, less often it equals, but it happens to be never higher.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=116|Аксаков|1910|2pp=304, 349}}

The author writes that some mediums, with their "mimic transfigurations", exhibit striking linguistic abilities. They can reproduce words and phrases "in strange, incomprehensible dialects", which they had previously accidentally heard without paying attention to this.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=60|Аксаков|1910|2p=380}} According to Hartmann, only a medium, who can write, can "produce [[automatic writing]] or perform writing at a distance [without the involvement of the hand]."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=49|Аксаков|1910|2p=369}}{{refn|group=note|However, Aksakov discovered "in the annals of spiritualism" several cases of mediumship of babies, associated with automatic writing.{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=369}}}}

=== Explanation of paranormal ===
In principle, Hartmann admits the possibility of a mediumistic phenomenon of "the penetration of matter", as well as allows for the possibility of all other phenomena confirmed by the testimony of witnesses. However, he opposes the hypothesis by German astronomer [[Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner|Zöllner]] about the fourth dimension of space, preferring, rather,  the statement "on the molecular shakes of material bonds in the body, than the one on movements and vibrations outside of three-dimensional space."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=45|Aksakow|1894a|2p=116}}{{refn|group=note|Zöllner never admitted that spiritistic phenomena are produced by the spirits of dead people, but he connected them with the actions of some "mysterious beings" controlling the fourth dimension of space.{{sfn|Treitel|2004|p=14}}}} According to Hartmann, neither the sack nor the cage in which the medium can be contained will not be a hindrance to him: if he can pass through a substance in a state of sleep, "nothing prevents him from appearing as a phenomenon in front of the audience, in spite of all these precautions."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=88|Aksakow|1894a|2p=223}}{{refn|group=note|In Aksakow's opinion, "penetration" of one solid body by another can be imagined as the dematerialization of matter at the moment of passing through the object and then its reverse materialization.{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=101}}}}

After the mentioning to the "expansive action" of the mediumistic nerve force that overcomes the "cohesion of material particles" and leads to acoustic phenomena, Hartmann proceeds to spiritistic phenomena related to "penetration of matter", classifying them as "an especially incredible field of phenomena." He refers to the confirmed experiments of Zöllner and the facts of "a [[apport (paranormal)|transference]]" of objects into a locked room,{{sfn|Melton|2001}} which repeatedly observed under the most stringent conditions of control. He lists various types of "the penetration of matter": the passing an iron ring through the hand of a medium, penetration of coins, slate-pencils, etc. in completely closed boxes, the inserting a ring on the table's leg, the tying of knots on ropes and belts with "sealed" ends, the bringing into the séance's room the items from another room or other houses, as well as bringing of flowers which were growing outside the room.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1pp=44–5|Aksakow|1894a|2p=115}}

According to Hartmann, medium can't by only his will or by his purely psychological influence, cause the above-mentioned physical phenomena in inanimate objects. The main action of the will is a release the "mediumistic nerve force" out the nervous system and its directing with a certain way on the living or dead objects. Nevertheless, according to him, in the study of any phenomena of mediumism, with the exception of [[clairvoyance]], there is no need to go "beyond the bounds of the natural explanations."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=106|Aksakow|1894a|2pp=127, 224}}

=== On hypothesis of spirits ===
In conclusion, Hartmann assesses the central idea of spiritism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Thus the whole hypothesis of spirits has dissolved into pure nothingness, after first the direct physical power, then the production of the phenomena of materialisation, and finally production of the ideality of the manifestations, have shifted from the presupposed spirits to the mediums. Whether there are spirits or not, we do not have to examine here; in any case, if there are any, they are referred back to that other world from which Spiritualism believed them to have sunk into this world."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=117|Aksakow|1894b|2p=749}}{{sfn|Carroll|2003}}{{refn|group=note|According to Massey, the spiritualistic hypothesis about the activities of the spirits of dead people was greatly exaggerated, and most of the reports allegedly originating from them could be explained by other reasons that were not recognized. He wrote, "The current Spiritualist conception of death as a simple change of external conditions, so that there is a mere continuity of consciousness on the same level, and in the same modes, seems to me to denote great poverty of thought nor are we constrained to accept it on the evidence of facts."{{sfn|Massey|2012|p=xv}} However, according to [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]], after he made five hundred séances with a medium [[Leonora Piper]], "no other hypothesis except for the spiritualistic one can explain the phenomena that he observed."{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=677}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
One of the most active critics of Hartmann's book was [[Alexander Aksakov]].{{sfn|Melton|2001a}}{{refn|group=note|His "Answer for Hartmann" Aksakov began to print in parts in a German journal ''Psychische Studien'' immediately after the publication of this book. In 1890, it was published as a single edition entitled ''Animismus und Spiritismus.''{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=16}}}} The proofs which Aksakov used to "disprove Hartmann's hallucination hypothesis" were the photographs of spirits. The pictures "taken during the séances, in which both the medium and the materialised form were visible," were convincingly demonstrating, according to Aksakov, that materialisation is "an objective phenomenon", and not a kind the mass hypnosis (see the photo on the left). Criticism by Aksakov was supported in the publications of occultists in the journal [[:de:Sphinx (Zeitschrift)|''Sphinx'']], where "Hartmann was portrayed variously as obtuse or dishonest for his refusal to recognise his logical errors."{{sfn|Wolffram|2009|p=42}} Aksakov has been emphasizing that Hartmann had no practical experience and did not pay enough attention to those facts that did not correspond to his convictions, and many phenomena were "completely unknown" to him.{{sfn|Doyle|2013|p=184}}{{refn|group=note|Karl Du Prel highly praised Aksakov's book as having great significance for spreading Spiritism in Germany—it was in detail discussed in his article "Hartmann contra Aksakof" published in the ''Sphinx'' in June 1891.{{sfn|Kaiser|2009|p=69}} He wrote that Hartmann's work takes only 118 pages, whereas Aksakov's response is more than 800 pages (two volumes). This contrast, which is "remarkable in itself," is further strengthened when the reader learns that, according to Hartmann, he himself was never present at séances,{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|p=16}} whereas Aksakov who has become interested in the Spiritist movement in 1855, since 1870, repeatedly participated in the spiritistic séances.{{sfnm|Treitel|2004|1p=14|Aksakow|2012|2p=xxv|Du Prel|2012b|3p=26}}}}

[[File:Axakov materialization.jpg|thumb|left|180px|&lt;center&gt;A materialised figure and medium in trance. Photo by A. N. Aksakov.&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Sir William Crookes and Katie King.jpg|thumb|left|180px|&lt;center&gt;William Crookes, Katie King, and hers medium.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Professor [[:da:Alfred Lehmann|Alfred Lehmann]] wrote that Hartmann uses his hypotheses, according to how it is more convenient to him: if a materialised figure appears on séance, then for him it is just a hallucination imagined by the participators of the séance; if this phantom is displayed in the photo, then its appearance is explained by the action of the mediumistic nerve force, since otherwise it could not be photographed. But the view arbitrarily using such unstable explanations is "scientifically untenable."{{sfn|Lehmann|1908|pp=375–6}} Commenting on Hartmann's statement that imprints of the organic forms are produced by the mediumistic nerve force,{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|p=52}} Aksakov wrote that this hypothesis necessarily leads to "the acceptance of the length, thickness, and density" of this force, in other words, to that which usually serves to define the body, thus such imprints should be produced "by the action of an invisible body formed with help of the medium," that is, by the materialised form.{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=138}} Hartmann also speaks that mediumistic nerve force "can cause thermal and light phenomena," for example, it can produce certain forms, "at least inorganic ones: crosses, stars, a bright field with light points shimmering on it."{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|pp=49–50}} Hence, here, according to Aksakov's commentary, the nerve force becomes visible and does not constitute a hallucination. Why then does the same force that has become visible in a materialized organic image, sometimes in a luminous one, turns into a hallucination? According to Aksakov, the hallucinatory hypothesis by Hartmann is destroyed "by his own logic."{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=284}}

In connection with the hypothesis of the author, explaining the physical phenomena of mediumship, Massey noted that "the opinion of most persons conversant with them will be that Hartmann's hypothesis is too complicated in itself, and even thus is unadequate to the facts."{{sfn|Massey|2012|p=xiv}} [[Karl, Freiherr von Prel|Karl Du Prel]] brought such Hartmann's statement from the first chapter of his book: "Since I never attended a séance myself, I am not in a condition to form a judgment on the reality of the phenomena in question... On the other hand, I hold myself at any rate competent to offer a conditional judgment on the conclusions to be drawn from these phenomena in case of their reality, for this is peculiarly the office of the philosopher."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1pp=16, 23|Du Prel|1891|2p=380}} Then he commented on this passage as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I must admit, I always believed that there is 'a golden rule for the philosopher'—to remain silent where he has no experience, so that no one could be told: 'Si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses!' (If you had been silent, you would have remained a philosopher!) That is why my final verdict lies in the fact that Hartmann, with his writings against spiritism, has certainly contributed to [[eristic]] but not in philosophy."{{sfn|Du Prel|1891|p=380}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, according to professor Heather Wolffram, such researchers as Hartmann and Aksakov with their searches "of a new scientific psychology based on the phenomena of the unconscious" are no less important for modern science than the materialist physiologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and his colleagues.{{sfn|Wolffram|2012}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Plot summary ==
In 1327, [[Franciscan|Franciscan friar]] [[William of Baskerville]] and Adso of [[Stift Melk|Melk]], a [[Benedictine]] [[Novice#Christianity|novice]] travelling under his protection, arrive at a Benedictine monastery in [[Northern Italy]] to attend a [[Disputation|theological disputation]]. This abbey is being used as an embassy between [[Pope John XXII]], and the Friars Minor, who are suspected of heresy. 

The monastery is disturbed by the death of Adelmo of Otranto, an illuminator revered for his illustrations. Adelmo was skilled at comical artwork, especially concerning religious matters. William is tasked by the monastery's [[abbot]], Abo of Fossanova to investigate the death, and he has a debate with one of the oldest monks in the abbey, Jorge of Burgos, about the theological meaning of laughter, which Jorge despises. 

The next day, a scholar of Aristotle and translator of Greek and Arabic, Venantius of Salvamec, is found dead in a vat of pig's blood. Previously, William and Adso had been prohibited from the library by the book keeper Malachi of Hildesheim, so they penetrate the labyrinth, discovering that there must be a hidden room, entitled the ''finis Africae.'' Bencio of Uppsala, a rhetoric scholar, reveals to William that Malachi, and his assistant Berengar of Arundel, had a homosexual relationship, until Berengar seduced Adelmo, who committed suicide out of religious shame. The only other monks who knew about the indiscretions were Jorge and Venantius.

By the day after, Berengar has gone missing, which puts pressure onto William. William learns of how Salvatore of Montferrat, and Remigio of Varagine, two cellarer monks, had a history with the [[Dulcinian|Dulcinian heretics]]. Meanwhile, Adso is seduced by a peasant girl, with whom he has his first sexual experience. After confessing to William, Adso is absolved, although he still feels guilty. Severinus of Sankt Wendel, the herbalist, tells William that Venantius's body had ink stains on the tongue and fingers, which suggests poison. William and Adso penetrate the library once more, discovering that Venantius had a book stolen from him, which they pursue. 

On the fourth day, Berengar is found drowned in a bath, although he bears ink stains similar to those of Venantius. Bernard Gui, a member of the [[Inquisition]], arrives to search for the murderer via Papal deduction. Due to this arrival, Gui arrests the peasant girl Adso loved, as well as Salvatore, accusing them both of heresy.

Remigio is interrogated by Gui, who scares him into revealing his heretic past, as well as falsely confessing to the crimes of the Abbey. Severinus then is found dead in his room, to which Jorge responds by leading a sermon about the coming of the Antichrist. 

Malachi returns to the early sermon that day near death, and his final words concern scorpions. Nicholas of Morimondo, the glazier, tells William that whoever is the librarian would then become the Abbot, and with new light, William goes to the library to search for evidence. The Abbot is distraught that William has not solved the crime, and that the Inquisition is undermining him, so he fires William. That night, William and Adso penetrate the library once more in search of the ''finis Africae.''

William and Adso discover Jorge waiting for them in the forbidden room. He says that he has been masterminding the Abbey for years, and his last victim is the Abbot himself, who has been led into the library. The Abbot suffocates, and Jorge tells them that Venantius's hidden book was [[Poetics_(Aristotle)|Aristotle's Second ''Poetics'']], which speaks of the virtues of laughter, something Jorge despises. Jorge poisoned the ink on the book, which is consumed when one turns the pages. Venantius was translating the book and died. Berengar found the body and disposed of it in pig's blood, fearing exposure, before reading the book himself and dying. Malachi was convinced by Jorge to retrieve the book, which was stashed with Severinus, so he kills Severinus and retrieves the book, before getting curious and dying as well. 

All of the murders time out with the [[Seven_trumpets|Seven Trumpets]], which call for objects falling from the sky (Adelmo threw himself from a tower), pools of blood, poison from water, bashing of the stars (Severinus was killed with his head bashed in with a celestial orb), scorpions, locusts, and fire. Jorge consumes the book's poisoned pages and uses Adso's lantern to start a fire, which burns down the library. As the fire spreads to the rest of the abbey, William laments his failure. Confused and defeated, William and Adso escape the abbey. Years later, Adso, now aged, returns to the ruins of the abbey and collects books that were salvaged from the fire, creating a lesser library.

== Major themes ==
{{essay-like|section|date=July 2011}}
Eco was a professor of [[semiotics]], and employs techniques of [[metanarrative]], partial fictionalization, and linguistic ambiguity to create a world enriched by layers of meaning. The solution to the central murder mystery hinges on the contents of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|book on Comedy]], which has been [[Lost work|lost]]. In spite of this, Eco speculates on the content and has the characters react to it. Through the motif of this lost and possibly suppressed book which might have aestheticized the farcical, the unheroic and the skeptical, Eco also makes an ironically slanted plea for tolerance and against dogmatic or self-sufficient metaphysical truths—an angle which reaches the surface in the final chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lars Gustafsson]], postscript to Swedish edition ''The Name of the Rose''&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Name of the Rose'' has been described as a work of [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref name=butler&gt;[[Christopher Butler]]. ''Postmodernism: A Very Short Introduction''. [[OUP]], 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-280239-2}} — see pages 32 and 126 for discussion of the novel.&lt;/ref&gt; The quote in the novel, "books always speak of other books, and every story tells a story that has already been told", refers to a postmodern idea that all texts perpetually refer to other texts, rather than external reality, while also harkening back to the medieval notion that citation and quotation of books was inherently necessary to write new stories. The novel ends with irony: as Eco explains in his ''Postscript to the Name of the Rose'', "very little is discovered and the detective is defeated."&lt;ref name="postscript"&gt;"Postscript to the Name of the Rose", printed in ''The Name of the Rose'' (Harcourt, Inc., 1984), p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; After unraveling the central mystery in part through coincidence and error, William of Baskerville concludes in fatigue that there "was no pattern." Thus Eco turns the modernist quest for finality, certainty and meaning on its head, leaving the overall plot partly the result of accident and arguably without meaning.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt;

== The aedificium's labyrinth ==
The mystery revolves around the abbey library, situated in a fortified tower—the aedificium. This structure has three floors—the ground floor contains the kitchen and [[refectory]], the first floor a [[scriptorium]], and the top floor is occupied by the library.&lt;ref&gt;First Day, Terce, paragraph 37&lt;/ref&gt; The two lower floors are open to all, while only the librarian may enter the last. A catalogue of books is kept in the scriptorium, where [[manuscript]]s are read and copied. A monk who wishes to read a book would send a request to the librarian, who, if he thought the request justified, would bring it to the scriptorium. Finally, the library is in the form of a labyrinth, whose secret only the librarian and the assistant librarian know.&lt;ref&gt;First Day, Terce, paragraph 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The aedificium has four towers at the four cardinal points, and the top floor of each has seven rooms on the outside, surrounding a central room. There are another eight rooms on the outer walls, and sixteen rooms in the centre of the maze. Thus, the library has a total of fifty-six rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Third Day, Vespers, paragraphs 50-56&lt;/ref&gt; Each room has a scroll containing a verse from the [[Book of Revelation]]. The first letter of the verse is the letter corresponding to that room.&lt;ref&gt;Third Day, Vespers, paragraphs 64-68&lt;/ref&gt; The letters of adjacent rooms, read together, give the name of a region (e.g. [[Hibernia]] in the West tower), and those rooms contain books from that region. The geographical regions are:
[[File:Labyrinthus Aedificium.svg|thumb|The aedificium's labyrinth]]
* ''Fons Adae'', 'The earthly paradise' contains Bibles and commentaries, East Tower
* ''Acaia'', Greece, Northeast
* ''Iudaia'', Judea, East
* ''Aegyptus'', Egypt, Southeast
* ''Leones'', 'South' contains books from Africa, South Tower
* ''Yspania'', Spain, Southwest outer
* ''Roma'', Italy, Southwest inner
* ''Hibernia'', Ireland, West Tower
* ''Gallia'', France, Northwest
* ''Germania'', Germany, North
* ''Anglia'', England, North Tower
Two rooms have no lettering - the easternmost room, which has an altar, and the central room on the south tower, the so-called ''finis Africae,'' which contains the most heavily guarded books, and can only be entered through a secret door. The entrance to the library is in the central room of the east tower, which is connected to the scriptorium by a staircase.&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Day, After Compline&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title ==
Much attention has been paid to the mystery the book's title refers to. In fact, Eco has stated that his intention was to find a "totally neutral title".&lt;ref name="postscript"/&gt; In one version of the story, when he had finished writing the novel, Eco hurriedly suggested some ten names for it and asked a few of his friends to choose one. They chose ''The Name of the Rose''.&lt;ref name="onLiterature"&gt;[[Umberto Eco]]. ''On Literature''. Secker &amp; Warburg, 2005, p. 129-130. {{ISBN|0-436-21017-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In another version of the story, Eco had wanted the neutral title ''Adso of Melk'', but that was vetoed by his publisher, and then the title ''The Name of the Rose'' "came to me virtually by chance." In the ''Postscript to the Name of the Rose'', Eco claims to have chosen the title "because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left".&lt;ref name="postscript" /&gt;

The book's last line, {{lang|la|"Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus"}} translates as: "the rose of old remains only in its name; we possess naked names." The general sense, as Eco pointed out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Name of the Rose: Title and Last Line | url = http://www.umbertoeco.com/id-39/UmbertEco_Name_of_the_Rose_Umberto_Eco.html | accessdate = 2007-03-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070121024505/http://www.umbertoeco.com/id-39/UmbertEco_Name_of_the_Rose_Umberto_Eco.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that from the beauty of the past, now disappeared, we hold only the name. In this novel, the lost "rose" could be seen as [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|book on comedy]] (now forever lost), the exquisite library now destroyed, or the beautiful peasant girl now dead.

The title is also an allusion to the [[nominalist]] position in the [[problem of universals]], taken by [[William of Ockham]]. According to nominalism, universals are bare names: there is not a universal rose, only the name ''rose''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crisismagazine.com/1987/war-of-the-rose-the-historical-context-of-the-name-of-the-rose&lt;/ref&gt;

This text has also been translated as "Yesterday's rose stands only in name, we hold only empty names." This line is a verse by twelfth century monk [[Bernard of Cluny]] (also known as Bernard of Morlaix). Medieval manuscripts of this line are not in agreement: Eco quotes one Medieval variant verbatim,&lt;ref&gt;Eco would have found this reading in, for example, the standard text edited by H.C. Hoskier (London 1929); only the Hiersemann manuscript preserves "Roma". For the verse quoted in this form before Eco, see e.g. Alexander Cooke, ''An essay on the origin, progress, and decline of rhyming Latin verse'' (1828), [https://books.google.com/books?id=u2_DthwIpvsC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22stat+rosa+pristina%22 p. 59], and Hermann Adalbert Daniel, ''Thesaurus hymnologicus sive hymnorum canticorum sequentiarum'' (1855), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6ScPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=%22stat+rosa+pristina%22 p. 290]. See further Pepin, Ronald E. "Adso's closing line in The Name of the Rose." ''American notes and queries'' (May–June 1986): 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt; but Eco was not aware at the time of the text more commonly printed in modern editions, in which the reference is to [[Rome]] (''Roma''), not to a rose (''rosa'').&lt;ref&gt;As Eco wrote in [http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_author.html "The Author and his Interpreters"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101231523/http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_author.html |date=2008-01-01 }} "Thus the title of my novel, had I come across another version of Morlay's poem, could have been ''The Name of Rome'' (thus acquiring fascist overtones)".&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative text, with its context, runs: ''Nunc ubi Regulus aut ubi Romulus aut ubi Remus? / Stat Roma pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus''. This translates as "Where now is Regulus, or Romulus, or Remus? / Primordial Rome abides only in its name; we hold only naked names."&lt;ref name="cluny"&gt;See the source edition of 2009: Bernard of Cluny, De contemptu mundi: Une vision du monde vers 1144, ed. and trans. A. Cresson, Témoins de notre histoire (Turnhout, 2009), p.&amp;nbsp;126 (bk. 1, 952), and note thereto p.&amp;nbsp;257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also the title of the book may be related to a poem by the Mexican poet and mystic [[Nun|Sor]] [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]] (1651–1695):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Rosa que al prado, encarnada,&lt;br /&gt;
te ostentas presuntuosa&lt;br /&gt;
de grana y carmín bañada:&lt;br /&gt;
campa lozana y gustosa;&lt;br /&gt;
pero no, que siendo hermosa&lt;br /&gt;
también serás desdichada.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

which appears in Eco's ''Postscript to the Name of the Rose'', and is translated into English in "Note 1" of that book as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Red rose growing in the meadow,&lt;br /&gt;
you vaunt yourself bravely&lt;br /&gt;
bathed in crimson and carmine:&lt;br /&gt;
a rich and fragrant show.&lt;br /&gt;
But no: Being fair,&lt;br /&gt;
You will be unhappy soon.&lt;ref name="postscript" /&gt;&lt;!-- "soon", not "too", is the translation provided in Note 1; please do not alter it --&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Refimprove section|date=June 2010}}

=== To other works ===
The name of the central character, William of Baskerville, alludes both to the fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] (compare ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' – also, Adso's description of William in the beginning of the book resembles, almost word for word, Dr. Watson's description of Sherlock Holmes when he first makes his acquaintance in ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'') and to [[William of Ockham]] (see the next section). The name of the narrator, his apprentice Adso of Melk is among other things a pun on Simplicio from [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ''Dialogue''; Adso deriving from "ad Simplicio" ("to Simplicio"). Adso's putative place of origin, Melk, is the site of a famous medieval library, at [[Melk Abbey]]. And his name echoes the narrator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Watson (omitting the first and last latters, with "t" and "d" being phonetically similar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ipbOrcd8q9UC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;lpg=PA257&amp;dq|title=Reading Eco: An Anthology|editor-first=Rocco|editor-last=Capozzi|date=February 22, 1997|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|isbn=9780253112828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blind librarian Jorge of [[Burgos]] is a nod to [[Argentina|Argentinian]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]], a major influence on Eco. Borges was blind during his later years and was also director of [[National Library of the Argentine Republic|Argentina's national library]]; his [[short story]] "[[The Library of Babel]]" is an inspiration for the secret library in Eco's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44089369|title=The library of Babel|last=1899-1986.|first=Borges, Jorge Luis,|date=2000|publisher=David R. Godine|others=Desmazières, Erik, 1948-, Hurley, Andrew, 1944-, Giral, Angela.|isbn=156792123X|location=Boston|oclc=44089369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Borges's stories, "[[The Secret Miracle]]", features a blind librarian. In addition, a number of other themes drawn from various of Borges's works are used throughout ''The Name of the Rose'': [[labyrinth]]s, mirrors, sects and obscure manuscripts and books.

The ending also owes a debt to Borges' short story "[[Death and the Compass]]", in which a detective proposes a theory for the behavior of a murderer. The murderer learns of the theory and uses it to trap the detective. In ''The Name of the Rose'', the librarian Jorge uses William's belief that the murders are based on the [[Revelation of John]] to misdirect William, though in Eco's tale, the detective succeeds in solving the crime.

The "poisoned page" motif may have been inspired by [[Alexandre Dumas]]' novel ''[[La Reine Margot (novel)|La Reine Margot]]'' (1845). It was also used in the film ''[[Il giovedì]]'' (1963) by Italian director [[Dino Risi]].&lt;ref name="Lolito"&gt;notes to {{cite book|title=Lolito|author=Daniele Luttazzi|pp=514–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar story is associated with the Chinese erotic novel ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]'', translated as ''The Golden Lotus'' or ''The Plum in the Golden Vase''.

Eco seems also to have been aware of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s short story "[[Debits and Credits (Kipling)|The Eye of Allah]]", which touches on many of the same themes, like optics, manuscript illumination, music, medicine, priestly authority and the Church's attitude to scientific discovery and independent thought, and which also includes a character named John of Burgos.

Eco was also inspired by the 19th century Italian novelist [[Alessandro Manzoni]], citing ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' as an example of the specific type of historical novel he purposed to create, in which some of the characters may be made up, but their motivations and actions remain authentic to the period and render history more comprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postscript to The name of the rose|last=Umberto.|first=Eco,|date=1984|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|others=Eco, Umberto.|year=|isbn=9780151731565|edition=1st|location=San Diego|pages=|oclc=10996520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the book, there are [[Latin]] quotes, authentic and apocryphal. There are also discussions of the philosophy of [[Aristotle]] and of a variety of [[Millenarism|millenarist]] heresies, especially those associated with the [[fraticelli]]. Numerous other philosophers are referenced throughout the book, often anachronistically, including [[Wittgenstein]].

=== To actual history and geography ===
[[File:La Sacra ammantata dalla neve.jpg|thumb|[[Sacra di San Michele|Saint Michael's Abbey]], in the [[Susa Valley]], [[Piedmont]]]]

William of Ockham, who lived during the time at which the novel is set, first put forward the principle known as [[Ockham's Razor]], often summarised as the ''[[dictum]]'' that one should always accept as most likely the simplest explanation that accounts for all the facts (a method used by William of Baskerville in the novel).

The book describes monastic life in the 14th century. The action takes place at a [[Benedictine]] abbey during the controversy surrounding the [[Apostolic poverty]] between branches of [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]; (see [[Franciscan#Renewed controversy on the question of poverty|renewed controversy on the question of poverty]]). The setting was inspired by monumental [[Sacra di San Michele|Saint Michael's Abbey]] in [[Susa Valley]], [[Piedmont]] and visited by Umberto Eco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avosacra.it/sito/curiosita_sulla_sacra.html|title=AVOSacra - Associazione volontari Sacra di San Michele|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2014}} The Spirituals abhor wealth, bordering on the [[Apostolics]] or [[Dulcinian]] [[heresy]]. The book highlights this tension that existed within [[Christianity]] during the medieval era: the Spirituals, one faction within the Franciscan order, demanded that the Church should abandon all wealth, and some heretical sects began killing the well-to-do, while the majority of the Franciscans and the clergy took to a broader interpretation of the gospel. Also in the background is the conflict between [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] and [[Pope John XXII]], with the Emperor supporting the Spirituals and the Pope condemning them.

A number of the characters, such as the [[Inquisitor]] [[Bernard Gui]], [[Ubertino of Casale]] and the [[Minorite]] [[Michael of Cesena]], are historical figures, though the novel's characterization of them is not always historically accurate. Eco notes in a companion book that he had to situate the monastery in mountains so it would experience early frosts, in order for the action to take place at a time when the historical Bernard Gui could have been in the area. For the purposes of the plot, Eco needed a quantity of pig blood, but at that time pigs were not usually slaughtered until a frost had arrived. Later in the year, Gui was known to have been away from Italy and could not have participated in the events at the monastery.

Part of the dialogue in the inquisition scene of the novel is lifted bodily from the historical Gui's own Manual for Inquisitors, the ''Practica Inquisitionis Heretice Pravitatis'', for example the dialogue: "What do you believe?" "What do you believe, my Lord?" "I believe in all that the Creed teaches." "So I believe, my Lord." Bernardo then points out that what Remigius the cellarer is saying is not that Remigius believes in the Creed, but that Remigius believes that ''Bernardo'' believes in the Creed. This is an example given by the historical Gui in his book to warn inquisitors against the slipperiness and manipulation of words by heretics. This use of Gui's own book by Eco is self-consciously of a piece with his perspective that "books always speak of other books". In this case, the author integrates the historical Bernard Gui's text into his own through the fictional character of Bernardo.

Adso's description of the portal of the monastery is recognizably that of the portal of the church at [[Moissac|Moissac, France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=cJRV1c57xfgC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=eglise+moissac+eco&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j21a4pin7R&amp;sig=DD4AIlhaW9YeYpObKApyUXvVsYE&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4-uj62f_YAhUxja0KHc0TBR4Q6AEIWjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=eglise%20moissac%20eco&amp;f=false|title=Signs of Change: Transformations of Christian Traditions and Their Representation in the Arts, 1000-2000|last=Petersen|first=Nils Holger|last2=Clüver|first2=Claus|last3=Bell|first3=Nicolas|date=2004|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9042009993|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante Alighieri]] and his ''[[Divine Comedy|Comedy]]'' are mentioned once in passing. There is also a quick reference to a famous "Umberto of Bologna"—Umberto Eco himself.

'''''The Second Forty Years''''' is a 1946 nonfiction self-help book about aging, by Edward Stieglitz.

Stieglitz graduated from [[Rush Medical College]] in 1921 and was on the faculty of the [[University of Chicago]] from 1923 to 1938. In 1940 a grant was given to support a [[gerontologist]] at the [[United States Public Health Service]], and Stieglitz was given the post. His research was also supported by the [[National Institute of Health]]. Stieglitz left the post after a year, for personal reasons.&lt;ref name=Achenbaum/&gt;

''The Second Forty Years'' provides Stieglitz's professional advice for the layman. It describes what can be expected during the aging process and what can be done about it, discussing chronic progressive disorders which require preventative care, sex, the importance of leisure and rest, and so forth. According to Stieglitz, mere longevity is not goal enough, but rather constructive health practices should be undertaken to enhance the quality of life.&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt; Regarding [[menopause]], Stieglitz characterized it as a "truly normal phase of living" and decried the "distorted descriptions" of [[old wives' tale]]s.&lt;ref name=Houck/&gt;

Newspaper advertisements for ''The Second Forty Years'' are probably the source for the popular quotation "It's not the years in your life that count, it's the life in your years", which is commonly misattributed to [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name=Yglesias/&gt;&lt;ref name=QuoteInvestigator/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6334">'''Timbral listening''' is the process of actively listening to the [[timbre|timbral]] characteristics of sound.

==Concept==
In timbral listening, 'pitch is subordinate to timbre'.  Instead, the specific quality of a musical tone is determined by considering 'the presence, distribution and relative [[amplitude]] of [[overtones]].'&lt;ref&gt;Süzükei, V., ''Listening The Tuvan Way'' in Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using this listening technique/ method of perception / interpretation there is 'a relation between timbre and [[Harmonic series (music)|spectral]] content which is analogous to that between pitch and [[frequency]] in that one is the prevalent cultural construct of the other'&lt;ref&gt;Waters, S., "Timbre Composition: Ideology, Metaphor and Social Process", Contemporary Music Review, 10:2 (1994), p133-134&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form of timbral listening is listening to [[speech]]. This is demonstrated by listening to, for example, the vowels /a/ and /i/ spoken at the same [[pitch accent|pitch]] and intensity. The difference between the two sounds is entirely one of spectrum, or as the term is used in this article, [[timbre]].

==Nature==

It has been suggested that "timbral listening is an ideal sonic mirror of the natural world".&lt;ref&gt;Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p58&lt;/ref&gt; It is often (but not always) used in association with musics that are based in [[mimicry]] of sounds in the natural environment. [[Valentina Suzukei]] suggests that 'it was the [[nomadic]] way of life and its focus on the timbral qualities of natural sounds that created this kind of musicality'.&lt;ref&gt;Süzükei, V., ''Listening The Tuvan Way'' in Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p51.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially prevalent in Canada where composers such as [[Hildegard Westerkamp]] apply the thinking of [[R. Murray Schafer]]'s World [[Soundscape]] Project to their compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Landy, L., 'The Something to Hold on to Factor in Timbral Composition', "Contemporary Music Review" 10:2 (1994): 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptive language and notation==

As timbre has 'no domain-specific adjectives' it 'must be described in metaphor or by analogy to other senses',&lt;ref&gt;Fales, C., "The Paradox of Timbre", Ethnomusicology, 46:1 (Winter, 2002), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; This method also has limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, S., "Timbre Composition: Ideology, Metaphor and Social Process", Contemporary Music Review, 10:2 (1994), p131, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

*Traditional music in [[Tuva]] and other Turkic cultures of inner Asia
The composition of timbre-centered music in the nomadic communities of Tuva involves mimicry of sounds heard in the environment. Timbral listening is a fundamental component of listening to, understanding and being able to correctly perform this music using vocal techniques such as [[Overtone singing|throat singing]] "khoomei" and harmonic producing instruments such as the [[jaw harp]], bzaanchy, shoor, qyl qiyak, qyl-gobyz, ku-rai and [[igil]].

*[[Burundi|Barundi]] whispered [[Inanga (instrument)|Inanga]] or ''Inanga Chucotée'' in Africa
This music employs a fundamental [[Drone (music)|drone]] and overtone harmonics. It consists of "a whispered text, accompanied by the ''inanga'', a trough [[zither]] of eight strings. To listen correctly (using timbral listening), one must consider "the effect of the combined timbres of the noisy whisper and the inanga" as a whole sound.&lt;ref&gt;Fales, C., "The Paradox of Timbre", Ethnomusicology, 46:1 (Winter, 2002), 56&lt;/ref&gt;

*Some forms of contemporary electronic music
More recently, computers and [[synthesizers]] are being used by contemporary composers to produce timbral-centered music. Contemporary composers state timbral listening as the correct technique to adopt in listening to and analysing their timbre (as opposed to pitch) based compositions. 'Pure timbres' are explored using methods such as [[granular synthesis]] in works such as ''Dragon of the Nebula'' by [[Mara Helmuth]].&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth, M., "Timbral Composition and Gesture" Columbia University Music Department, available at {{cite web |url=http://meowing.memh.uc.edu/~mara/papers/TimbralCompGest.Greece92.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20020121195155/http://meowing.memh.uc.edu/~mara/papers/TimbralCompGest.Greece92.html |archivedate=2002-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Shakuhachi]] music in Japan
The music produced by the Shakuhachi end blown flute such as [[honkyoku]], contains timbral variations that are of equal importance to pitch variations. These timbral variations are indicated in [[Shakuhachi musical notation]].&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Donald Paul (Autumn, 1969). "The Shakuhachi and the Kinko Ryu Notation". Asian Music 1 (2): 32–72. Springer. {{doi|10.2307/833910}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

The technique of timbral listening is used by sound engineers to evaluate timbre difference.&lt;ref&gt;Quesnel, R., "Timbral Ear Trainer: Adaptive, Interactive Training of Listening Skills for Evaluation of Timbre Differences", paper presented at the 100th Audio Engineering Society Convention, Copenhagen, May 11th–14th, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Transpersonal anthropology''' is a subdiscipline of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[transpersonal studies]]. It studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and [[culture]].

==Definition and context==
According to Walsh and Vaughan,&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"&gt;Walsh, R. and F. Vaughan. On transpersonal definitions. ''Journal of Transpersonal Psvchology'', 25:199-207, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed several definitions of the transpersonal field in the early 1990’s, «Transpersonal anthropology is the cross-cultural study of transpersonal phenomena and the relationship between consciousness and culture.» Charles Laughlin,&lt;ref name="Laughlin 2013"&gt; Laughlin, C. D. (2013). The ethno-epistemology of transpersonal experience: The view from transpersonal anthropology. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 32(1), 43–50.&lt;/ref&gt; a founder of the field of Transpersonal anthropology, has defined the discipline as «the cross-cultural study of transpersonal experiences, including the sociocultural evocation, interpretation, and utility of transpersonal experiences, and their involvement in defining social roles».

As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.&lt;ref name="Young &amp; Goulet 1994"&gt;Young, David E. and J.-G. Goulet (1994) ''Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences''. Peterborough: Broadview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sheppard &lt;ref name="Sheppard 2006"&gt; Sheppard, E. (2006) "Our worlds beyond." ''Transpersonal Psychology Review'' 10 ,(1):63-70. &lt;/ref&gt; has noted how transpersonal anthropology can be said to have begun in the USA in the 1970s. By the mid-eighties the discipline was described as a «young and growing field» by commentators.&lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"&gt; Valle, Ronald S. &amp; Harari, Carmi. Current developments in...Transpersonal Psychology. ''The Humanistic Psychologist'' 11, Vol. 13, NO. 1, Winter 1985&lt;/ref&gt; There was, by this time, also a development at the organizational level, in the form of the ''Association of Transpersonal Anthropology'', with  its supporting publication, the ''Phoenix''.&lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"/&gt; According to Hunter,&lt;ref name="Hunter 2015"&gt; Hunter, Jack. "Between Realness and Unrealness": Anthropology, Parapsychology and the Ontology of Non-Ordinary Realities. ''DISKUS'' 17.2 (2015), 4-20 (The Journal of the British Association for the Study of Religions)&lt;/ref&gt; the parallel field of [[Anthropology of Consciousness]] grew out of the transpersonal perspective, including Transpersonal anthropology.

Central to the development of the field has been the work of anthropologist [[Charles D. Laughlin]], who is considered to be one of the primary founders of the discipline.&lt;ref name="Hartelius 2014 "&gt; Hartelius, Glenn. The Imperative for Diversity in a Transpersonal Psychology of the Whole Person. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 33(2), 2014, pp. iii-iv&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shepard &lt;ref name="Sheppard 2006"/&gt; also notes the contributions of Ihsan Al-Issa, &lt;ref name="Al-Issa 1995"&gt;Al-Issa, Ihsan . (1995). "The Illusion of Reality and Reality of Illusion." ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'' 166 (3)368-373.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edith Turner (anthropology)|Edith Turner]],&lt;ref name="Turner 1996"&gt;Turner, Edith (1996) ''The Hands Feel It: Healing and Spirit Presence Among a Northern Alaskan People''. DeKalb, IL: Northern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; wife of the anthropologist  [[Victor Turner]].

==Contributions to academic theory==
One of the  contributions of Laughlin to anthropological theory is a differentiation between so-called monophasic and polyphasic cultures. According to this theory polyphasic cultures are open to altered states of consciousness, and tries to integrate these experiences into their worldview, while monophasic cultures, typical  of technocratical societies, are largely closed to these alternative states of mind.&lt;ref name="Laughlin 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartelius 2014 "/&gt; Laughlin has published extensively on the topic of Transpersonal anthropology, and has addresses several issues within the field, including methodology.&lt;ref name="Laughlin MacManus Shearer 1983"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D., McManus, John and Shearer, Jon  (1983) "Dreams, Trance and Visions: What a Transpersonal Anthropology Might Look Like".  ''Phoenix:  Journal of Transpersonal Anthropology'' 7 (1/2):141-159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1988"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1988) "Transpersonal Anthropology: Some Methodological Issues."  ''Western Canadian Anthropology'' 5:29-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1994a"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1994) "Psychic Energy and Transpersonal Experience: A Biogenetic Structural Account of the Tibetan Dumo Practice," in ''Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences'' (ed. by D.E. Young and J.-G. Goulet).  Peterborough: Broadview Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;99–134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1994b"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1994) "Transpersonal Anthropology, Then and Now."  ''Transpersonal Review'' 1(1): 7-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1994c"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1994) "Apodicticity:  The Problem of Absolute Certainty in Transpersonal Anthropology."  ''Anthropology &amp; Humanism'' 19(2): 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Al-Issa &lt;ref name="Al-Issa 1995"/&gt; has dealt with the topic of hallucinations, and the cultural aspects of them. Here, Al-Issa notes how not all cultures have negative views on hallucinations. Cross-cultural differences are noted by Al-Issa in sensory modalities most commonly encountered in hallucinations.

The field also includes the theories of anthropologist Dennis Gaffin whose contribution is a re-conceptualization of fairyology and the [[fairy]]-faith within the context of anthropology.&lt;ref name="Leykam 2013"&gt; Leykam, A. E. Book Review: Running with the fairies: towards a transpersonal anthropology of religion. ''Choice'' ; Middletown  Vol. 50, Iss. 6,  (Feb 2013): 1099. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler 2015"&gt; Butler, Jenny. Book Review: Gaffin, Dennis. 2013. Running with the Fairies: Towards a Transpersonal Anthropology of Religion. ''Fieldwork in Religion'', 10.2 (2015), 252–254&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheppard&lt;ref name="Sheppard 2006"/&gt; explains how Edith Turner's interpretations of her husband's field studies among the [[Ndembu]] in [[Zambia]] also can be interpreted as belonging to transpersonal anthropology, insofar as her interpretations of their [[healing ritual]]s were transpersonal.

==Criticism==

Sheppard &lt;ref name="Sheppard 2007"&gt;Sheppard, E. (2007). Anthropology and the development of the transpersonal movement: Finding the transpersonal in transpersonal anthropology. ''Transpersonal Psychology Review'' 11(1) 59-69 {{ISSN|1366-6991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has published an article criticising transpersonal anthropology, at least as it has typically been practiced in contemporary scholarship. Her criticisms include its lack of a systematic conceptual base; its over-emphasis on shamanism; the difficulty in studying non-Western cultures that have been truly immune to Western influences and the question of the extent to which transpersonal anthropology has really addressed [[altered states of consciousness]].

The '''University of Santo Tomas College of Education''', popularly known as '''"UST-Educ"''', is the teacher education, nutrition and dietetics, food technology, and library and information science school of the University of Santo Tomas, the oldest and the largest [[Catholic]] university in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. It was established in 1926 at [[Intramuros]], [[Manila]].

On June 2, 2008, the Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd) and Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd) programs of the College were proclaimed '''Center of Excellence (COE)''' in [[Education]] by the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]]. Likewise, the Department of Education designated it as a '''Center of Training (COT)'''

The different degree programs of the College are accredited by the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA). In the academic year 2011-2012, the BSEd and BEEd programs have been granted '''Level III''' accreditation status. In 2013, the BSFT and BSND programs have been granted '''Level III ''' re-accredited status. The BLIS program has also been granted '''Candidate ''' accreditation status last academic year 2014-2015.

The College is a top performing school in the board examinations for teachers, nutritionist-dietitians and librarians.

==History of the College==
The U.S.T. College of Education was founded in June 1926 during the rectorate of Very Rev. Fr. Manuel Arellano, O.P. Classes at the college commenced in Intramuros, Manila. It offered the four-year Bachelor of Science in Education (B.S.E.) degree.

In 1940, the normal school was established and offered a two-year course leading to Elementary Teachers Certificate (E.T.C.). In 1941, the Elementary Training Department was opened as a laboratory school of the College of Education. In 1953, the degree Bachelor of Science in Home Economics (B.S.H.E.) was offered. In June 1954, the Elementary Teachers Certificate was changed into a four-year degree called Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education. From 1955-1957, a new major in Food and Nutrition was added; and later transformed into Bachelor of Science in Foods and Nutrition (B.S.F.N.).

In the school year 1970-71, the Institute of Nutrition was established as an independent body from the College of Education under the Vice Rector for Academic Affairs. Another significant event in 1971 was the merging of the Normal School with the College of Education due to the decreasing enrollment rate of the former. In July 1971, a Special Assistant to the Dean was created to take charge of the Normal elementary School since the Directress and the Secretary of the School positions were abolished.

From 1974-1976, the College offered new major studies in Chemistry and in School Guidance &amp; Character Education. The latter major replaced the co-major in Theology. The College introduced the following terminal courses to meet the demands for manpower: Certificate in Practical Arts (2 years),Certificate in Practical Dietetics (2 years) and Tourist Guide Certificate (1 year). The two former courses/programs were later on phased out while the Tourist Guide Certificate was changed into Associate in Tourism (2 years).

In the 1980s, the College of Education phased out all vocational courses/programs and the Institute of Nutrition was abolished. Later on, the College offered the following four-year degree programs: Bachelor of Science in Tourism, Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics, and Bachelor of Science in Hotel &amp; Restaurant Management.

From 1990-1992, new majors for the Bachelor of Secondary Education program were offered: Computer Technology Education; Home Management and Vocational Technology (which replaced Home Economics); and Values Education (which replaced the Guidance and Character Education). The Early Childhood Education was also introduced as a new major for the Bachelor of Elementary Education program.

In the School Year 2006-07, the B.S. Tourism and B.S. Hotel and Restaurant Management programs were transferred into a newly established body of the University - the Institute of Tourism and Hospitality Management (I.T.H.M.). The I.T.H.M. was later renamed as College of Tourism and Hospitality Management.

In 2004, the College collaborated with Hanyang University (South Korea) for a student-exchange program.

In 2007, the College was the second top performing school in the nutrition-dietetics board exam with a passing rate of 80%, higher than the national passing rate of 56.40%. Four Thomasians entered the Top Ten Examinees of the said P.R.C. examination.
