The '''32nd century BC''' was a [[century]] which lasted from the year 3200 BC to 3101 BC.

==Significant people==
*[[Iry-Hor]], earliest ruler of Egypt known by name.&lt;ref name="beck"&gt;[[Jürgen von Beckerath]]: ''Handbuch der ägyptischen Königsnamen'', Münchner ägyptologische Studien, Heft 49, Mainz : P. von Zabern, 1999, {{ISBN|3-8053-2591-6}}, [http://www.mediafire.com/view/?4xjd6j4qed3c9vl available online] see p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Narmer]], founder of the [[First dynasty of Egypt]].

==Calendar epochs==
*3114 BC: According to the most widely accepted correlations between the Western calendar and the calendar systems of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], the mythical starting point of the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] cycle occurs in this year.&lt;ref&gt;See Finley (2002), Houston (1989, pp.49–51), Miller and Taube (1993, pp.50–52), Schele and Freidel (1990, pp.430 ''et seq.''), Voss (2006, p.138), Wagner (2006, pp.281–283). Note that Houston 1989 mistakenly writes "3113 BC" (when "-3113" is meant), and Miller and Taube 1993's mention of "2 August" is a (presumed) erratum.&lt;/ref&gt; The Long Count calendar, used and refined most notably by the [[Maya civilization]] but also attested in some other (earlier) Mesoamerican cultures, consisted of a series of interlocked cycles or periods of day-counts, which mapped out a linear sequence of days from a notional starting point. The system originated sometime in the Mid- to Late Preclassic period of [[Mesoamerican chronology]], during the latter half of the 1st millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993, p.50), Schele and Freidel (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; The starting point of the most commonly used highest-order cycle&lt;ref&gt;Most commonly used in the Classic period [[Maya script|Maya inscriptions]]; some other [[Maya calendar]] inscriptions of this period note even longer cycles, while later Postclassic-era inscriptions in Maya cities of northern [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] generally used an abbreviated form known as the Short Count. See Miller and Taube (1993, p.50); Voss (2006, p.138).&lt;/ref&gt;—the ''[[b'ak'tun]]''-cycle consisting of thirteen b'ak'tuns of 144,000 days each—was projected back to an earlier, mythical date. This date is equivalent to 11 August 3114 BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]] (or 6 September in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]]), using the correlation known as the "Goodman-Martínez-Thompson (GMT) correlation". The GMT-correlation is worked out with the Long Count starting date equivalent to the [[Julian Day Number]] (JDN) equal to 584283, and is accepted by most [[Mayanist]] scholars as providing the best fit with the ethnohistorical data.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;See survey by Finley (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Two succeeding dates, the 12th and 13 August (Gregorian) have also been supported, with the 13th (JDN = 584285, the "astronomical" or "Lounsbury" correlation) attracting significant support as according better with astronomical observational data.&lt;ref&gt;After a modified proposal championed by [[Floyd Lounsbury]]; sources that have used this 584285 correlation include Houston (1989, p.51), and in particular Schele and Freidel (1990, pp.430 ''et seq.''). See also commentary by Finley (2002), who although making an assessment that the "[584285 correlation] is now more popular with Mayanists", expresses a personal preference for the 584283 correlation.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is still contended which of these three dates forms the actual starting base of the Long Count, the correlation to one of this triad of dates is definitively accepted by almost all contemporary Mayanists. All other earlier or later correlation proposals are now discounted.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The end of the thirteenth baktun was either on December 21 or 23 of 2012 ([[2012 phenomenon|supposed end of the world]]).

'''''A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith''''' is a stand-alone special parody of the [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon series, ''[[The Yogi Bear Show]]'', which revolves around [[Ranger Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The much-loved character and friends, created by Hanna-Barbera, are back--but with John Kricfalusi's twist. |newspaper= The Los Angeles Times|date=September 23, 1999|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/23/entertainment/ca-13166|accessdate=2010-08-24 | first=Michael P. | last=Lucas}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith'' was made by ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'' creator [[John Kricfalusi]] and his company [[Spümcø]]. '' A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith'' originally aired on [[Cartoon Network]] on September 24, 1999, along with ''[[Boo Boo Runs Wild]]'', a similar Yogi Bear-themed stand alone special.

Since its original debut in 1999, ''A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith'' has aired on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, [[Adult Swim]].

This short marked the last time [[Greg Burson]] voiced Yogi, as he was arrested five years after its release and subsequently died in 2008. It is dedicated to William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.

==Plot==
Ranger Smith awakes to a depressing morning where he declares his hate of the job. He then walks outside and wakes the sun by kicking on a mountain in the foreground. Then he proceeds to walk through the forest, changing appearances every time he passes a tree. He shows more enjoyment to the job as he is walking through the forest. He then finds a squirrel holding acorns. Ranger Smith demands to see a license for them. When the squirrel doesn't produce one Ranger Smith confiscates the nuts. The squirrel's children then poke their heads from the door. Ranger Smith notices this and demands to see a marriage license. When the squirrel can't produce one Ranger Smith decides to write a ticket but to let him off "easy" this time. He demands that the squirrel store pickles for the winter, and he may only keep one child. The scene then changes to [[Yogi Bear]] and [[Boo-Boo Bear|Boo Boo Bear]]'s cave. The two bears are showering while Ranger Smith watches them taking notes. The scene suddenly goes to night with Ranger Smith on his hands and knees holding a flash light to his face. He then says that it is "Owl Feeding Time" and that what he has to do is not for civilian eyes. The screen cuts to black and strange sound effects are played. When the scene cuts back Ranger Smith is now standing; he looks as if he were beaten. He then proceeds to go back to his cabin. He gets back in bed once again complaining about his job and life.

'''Afro-Jamaicans''' are [[Jamaicans]] of full or partial [[Black people|Black African]] descent. The first Africans that were brought came in 1513 from the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. They were [[servants]], [[cowboy]]s, herders of cattle, pigs and horses, as well as hunters. When the [[English people|English]] captured Jamaica in 1655, many of them fought with the Spanish, who gave them their freedom, and then fled to the mountains, resisting the British for many years to maintain their freedom, becoming known as [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]]. The British brought with them mostly [[Akan people|Akan]] slaves, some of which ran away and joined with Maroons and even took over as leaders.

== Origin ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
Africans were captured in wars, as retribution for crimes committed or by abduction and marched to the coast in "coffles" with their necks yoked to each other.
The most common means of enslaving an African was through abduction. They were placed in trading posts or forts to await the horrifying six- to twelve-week [[Middle Passage]] voyage between Africa and the [[Americas]] during which they were chained together, underfed, kept in the ship's hold in the thousands [packed more like sardines than humans. Those who survived were fattened up and oiled to look healthy prior to being auctioned in public squares to the highest bidders.

=== Ethnicities ===
Based on the phoenix ship records, enslaved Africans mostly came from the [[Akan people]] ([[Twi]] [Ashanti Akyem, etc.], Fante and Bono) followed by [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Kongo people|Kongo]], [[Fon people]] and [[Ibibio people]]. Akan (then called ''Coromantee'') culture was the dominant African culture in Jamaica.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Jamaica, From Its Discovery To The Year 1872|first= William James |last=Gardner |publisher=Appleton &amp; Company |page=184 |year=1909 |isbn=978-0415760997|url=https://www.amazon.com/History-Jamaica-Discovery-Christopher-Columbus/dp/0415760992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally in earlier British colonization, however the island before the 1750s was in fact mainly Akan imported. However, between 1663 and 1700, only six per cent of slave ships to Jamaica listed their origin as the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], while between 1700 and 1720 that figure went up to 27 per cent. The number of Akan slaves arriving in Jamaica from Kormantin ports only increased in the early eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Siva, ''After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842'', PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; But due to frequent rebellions from the then known "Coromantee" that often joined the slave rebellion group known as the [[Jamaican Maroons]], other groups were sent to Jamaica. The Akan population was still maintained because they were the preference of British planters in Jamaica because they were "better workers", according to these Planters. According to the Slave Voyages Archives, though the Igbo had the highest importation numbers, they were only imported to Montego Bay and St. Ann's bay ports, while the Gold Coast (mainly Akan) were more dispersed across the island and were a majority imported to 7 of 14 of the island's ports(each parish has one port).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slavevoyages.org/|title=Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade|website=Slavevoyages.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Field slaves fetched £25–£75 while skilled slaves such as carpenters fetched prices as high as £300. The majority of the house slaves were [[mulatto]]es. On reaching the plantation, the slaves underwent a "seasoning" process in which they were placed with an experienced slave who taught them the ways of the estate. Although the initial slave traders were the Portuguese and the Dutch, between 1750 and 1807 (the year in which the British Empire abolished the slave trade), Britain "dominated the buying and selling of slaves to the Americas". They were also Brown/Mulatto or [[multiracial|mixed race]] people at the time who had more privileges than the Blacks and usually held higher paying jobs and occupations. Shipbuilding flourished and manufacturing expanded: the "process of industrialization in England from the second quarter of the eighteenth century as to an important extent a response to colonial demands for rails, axes, buckets, coaches, clocks, saddles...and a thousand other things"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0059.htm|title=Jamaica Gleaner : Pieces of the Past:The Arrival Of The Africans|website=old.jamaica-gleaner.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Atlantic Slave Trade]] began in the 15th century when the Portuguese took hold of land near [[Gibraltar]] and soon encountered Africans, whom they quickly took as prisoners. By mid-century, the first public sale of these prisoners was held. By 1455 Portugal was importing close to 800 enslaved Africans a year. Sugar cultivation began in the Azores islands, and as the demand for sugar grew, so did the demand for slaves to work the fields of sugar cane. By the 16th century, other countries wanted a piece of this action and the competition for the sugar and enslavement trades began.

By 1700 Jamaica was awash with sugar [[plantation]]s and Jamaica's population consisted of 7,000 English to 40,000 enslaved Africans. The sugar industry grew  quickly in Jamaica—in 1672 there were 70 plantations producing 772 tonnes of sugar per annum—growing in the 1770s to over 680 plantations. By 1800, it was 21,000 English to 300,000 enslaved Africans. In 1820 there were 5,349 properties in Jamaica of which 1,189 contained over 100 enslaved Africans.  Each estate was its own small world, complete with an entire labour force of field workers and skilled artisans, a hospital, water supply, cattle, mules and horses as well as its own fuel source. Each plantation fuelled the wheels of [[Great Britain|British]] [[mercantilism]]. Sugar, molasses and rum were exported to England for sale and ships were financed to return to Africa and collect more slaves in exchange for trinkets and transport them to the West Indies as a labour source. This became known as the [[Triangular Trade]]. Money was not left in England's colonies, the financing came from Mother England, and to Mother England the profits returned.

=== Sugar estates ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
A typical sugar estate was {{convert|900|acre|km2}}. This included a [[White Witch (of Rose Hall)|Great House]] where the owner or overseer and the domestic enslaved Africans lived, and nearby accommodation for the bookkeeper, distiller, mason, carpenter, blacksmith, cooper and wheelwright. With the exception of the bookkeeper, by the middle of the eighteenth century, skilled enslaved Africans had replaced white indentured servants in these posts. The field enslavement' quarters were usually about a half mile away, closer to the industrial sugar mill, distillery and the boiling and curing houses, as well as the [[blacksmith]]s' and carpenters' sheds and thrash houses. In addition, there was a poultry pen and a cattle yard along with a hospital for Africans. Some estates, if large enough, had accommodation for an estate doctor.  Estates had estate gardens and the Africans had their own kitchen gardens as well as polnicks  provision grounds found in the hills, which were required by law from as early as 1678. During enslavement, however, the enslaved Africans kept pigs and poultry and grew mangoes, plantain, [[ackee]], [[okra]], yam and other ground provisions. The cultivation of these lands took on greater proportions as plantations were abandoned when the island faced increasing competition from [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]] and beet sugar, a loss in labour after emancipation in the 1830s as well as the loss of protective trade duties after the passage of the 1846 Sugar Equalization Act in [[England]].

The workforce on each plantation was divided into gangs determined by age and fitness. On average most estates had three main field gangs. The first was made up of the strongest and most able men and women. The second, of those no longer able to serve in the first, and the third, of older enslaved Africans and older children. Some estates had four gangs, depending on the number of children living on the estate. Children started working as young as 3 or 4 years old.

==== Significance of sugar ====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
To a large extent, Jamaican customs and culture were fashioned by sugar. According to John Hearne (1965), for two hundred years sugar was the only reason behind Jamaica's existence as a centre for human habitation. For centuries, sugar was Jamaica's most important crop. Jamaica was once considered the "jewel" in Britain's crown. In 1805, the island's peak of sugar production, it produced 101,600 tonnes of sugar. It was the world's leading individual sugar producer.

The cultivation of sugar was intricately intertwined with the system of African enslavement. This connection has set the course of the nation's demographics since the 18th century when enslaved Africans vastly outnumbered any other population group. The descendants of the  enslaved Africans comprise the majority of Jamaica's population. They have influenced every sphere of Jamaican life and their contributions are immeasurable.

== Culture ==
As Jamaican enslaved peoples came from West Africa, many of their customs survived based on memory and myths. They encompassed the life cycle, i.e. a newborn was not regarded as being of this world until nine days had passed and burial often involved libations at the graveside, and the belief that the dead body's spirit would not be at rest for some 42 days(a derivative of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] beliefs like [[Adae Kese Festival]]). They included forms of religion in which healing was considered an act of faith completed by obeahmen and communication with the spirits involved possession often induced by dancing and drumming. African-based religions include Myal and Revival and later [[Kumina]] from Congolese immigrants. Many involved recreational, ceremonial and functional use of music and dance. "Slaves," Brathwaite explains, "danced and sang at work, at play, at worship, from fear, from sorrow from joy". They recreated African musical instruments from materials found in Jamaica ([[calabash]], [[conch]], [[bamboo]], etc.) and featured improvisation in song and dance. All of these customs and many more such as the Christmas street parades of Jonkonnu, were misunderstood and undervalued by Europeans with the exception of the political use of drumming to send coded messages from plantation to plantation. Drumming of any kind was therefore often banned. Jamaican music today has emerged from the traditional musical forms of work songs sung by slaves, the ceremonial music used in religious services and the social and recreational music played on holidays and during leisure time. The cramped housing space provided to the enslaved Africans, which limited their dwellings (often made of wattle and daub) to one window and one door, meant that very little other than sleeping took place indoors. Life, as in Africa, was lived communally, outside. Similarly language, as in Africa, is considered powerful, particularly naming. Brathwaite (1971) gives an example of a woman whose child falls ill and wants her name to be changed, believing that this would allow her to be cured. Language is certainly an area where African retention is strongest. Jamaicans today move between [[Patois]] a creolised English and standard English. Jamaican patois was born from the intermixing of African slaves and [[English people|English]], [[Irish people in Jamaica|Irish]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], Scottish sailors, enslaved Africans, servants, soldiers and merchants. The enslaved African spoke many dialects, and given the need for a common tongue, Jamaican patois was born. It has been in use since the end of the 17th century by Jamaicans of all ethnicities and has been added to by the, [[Chinese Jamaican|Chinese]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indians]], [[Lebanese immigration to Jamaica|Lebanese]], [[Germans in Jamaica|Germans]], and [[French immigration to Jamaica|French]] who also settled on the island. Some words also indicate Spanish and [[Taíno people|Taino]] presence in Jamaican history. Many of these traditions survive to this day, testament to the strength of West African culture despite the process of creolisation (the intermingling of peoples adjusting to a new environment) it encountered.

===Myal and Revival===
'''Kumfu''' (from the word ''Akom'' the name of the [[Akan people|Akan]] spiritual system) was documented as ''Myal'' and originally only found in books, while the term Kumfu is still used by Jamaican Maroons. The priest of Kumfu was called a ''Kumfu-man''. In 18th-century Jamaica, only Akan gods were worshipped by Akan as well as by other enslaved Africans. The Akan god of creation, [[Nyame|Nyankopong]] was given praise but not worshipped directly. They poured libation to [[Asase Ya]], the goddess of the earth. But nowadays they are only observed by the Maroons who preserved a lot of the culture of 1700's Jamaica.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

"Myal" or Kumfu evolved into Revival, a syncretic Christian sect. Kumfu followers gravitated to the American [[Revival of 1800|Revival of 1800 Seventh Day Adventist movement]] because it observed Saturday as god's day of rest. This was a shared aboriginal belief of the Akan people as this too was the day that the Akan god, [[Nyame]], rested after creating the earth. Jamaicans that were aware of their Ashanti past while wanting to keep hidden, mixed their Kumfu spirituality with the American Adventists to create Jamaican Revival in 1860. Revival has two sects: ''60 order'' (or Zion Revival, the order of the heavens) and ''61 order'' (or Pocomania, the order of the earth). 60 order worships God and spirits of air or the heavens on a Saturday and considers itself to be the more 'clean' sect. 61 order more deals with spirits of the earth. This division of Kumfu clearly shows the dichotomy of Nyame and [[Asase Yaa]]'s relationship, Nyame representing ''air'' and has his 60 order'; ''Asase Yaa'' having her 61 order of the ''earth''. Also the Ashanti funerary/war colours: red and black have the same meaning in Revival of ''vengeance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jamaican Folk Medicine: A Source Of Healing|first=Mervyn C. |last=Allenye |publisher=University of the West Indies Press|pages=36 |year=2004 |isbn=9789766401238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Ashanti elements include the use of swords and rings as means to guard the spirit from spiritual attack. The [[Asantehene]] like the Mother Woman of Revival, has special two swords used to protect himself from witchcraft called an [[Akrafena]] or ''soul sword'' and a Bosomfena or ''spirit sword'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Running to Mother-Thugs Seek Guard Rings and Divine Protection |publisher=''Jamaica Gleaner'' |date=September 19, 2010 |url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100919/lead/lead4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues/ag/asante_gold_regalia/i_history-significance-usage/iv.aspx|title=British Museum - I.v|website=Britishmuseum.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Canoe===
A festival was dedicated to the heroism of the [[Akan people|Akan]] king 'John Canoe' an [[Ahanta]] from [[Axim]], [[Ghana]] in 1708. See [[John Canoe]] section.

=== Jamaican Patois ===
{{main|Jamaican Patois|List of Jamaican Patois words of African origin}}
Jamaican Patois, known locally as Patwa, is an [[English language|English]]–[[Languages of Africa|African]] [[creole language]] spoken primarily in [[Jamaica]] and the [[Jamaican diaspora]]. It is not to be confused with [[Jamaican English]] nor with the [[Rastafarian vocabulary|Rastafarian use of English]]. The language developed in the 17th century, when enslaved peoples from West and Central Africa blended their dialect and terms with the learned [[vernacular]] and [[dialect]]al forms of English spoken: [[British English]]es (including significant exposure to Scottish English) and [[Hiberno English]].  Jamaican Patwa is a ''[[post-creole speech continuum]]'' (a ''linguistic continuum'') meaning that the variety of the language closest to the [[lexifier]] language (the [[acrolect]]) cannot be distinguished systematically from intermediate varieties (collectively referred to as the [[mesolect]]) nor even from the most divergent rural varieties (collectively referred to as the [[basilect]]). Jamaicans themselves usually refer to their use of English as patwa, a term without a precise linguistic definition.

Jamaican Patois contains many loanwords of African origin, a majority of those etymologically from [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] region (particularly of the [[Asante-Twi]] dialect of the Akan language of [[Ghana]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy FG: Multiple etymologies in Jamaican Creole. Am Speech 1966, 41:211-215&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proverbs ===
Most Jamaican proverbs are of [[Asante people]], while some included other African proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/ppj/ppj001.htm|title=Psychic Phenomena of Jamaica: CHAPTER I|website=Sacred-texts.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic studies==
===Jamaican mtDNA===
A DNA test study submitted to BMC Medicine in 2012 states that "....despite the historical evidence that an overwhelming majority of slaves were sent from the Bight of Biafra and West-central Africa near the end of the British slave trade, the mtDNA haplogroup profile of modern Jamaicans show a greater affinity with groups found in the present day [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] region [[Ghana]]....this is because Africans arriving from the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] may have thus found the acclimatization and acculturation process less stressful because of cultural and linguistic commonalities, leading ultimately to a greater chance of survivorship and a greater number of progeny.

More detailed results stated: "Using haplogroup distributions to calculate parental population contribution, the largest admixture coefficient was associated with the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] (all of which were [[Asante people|Ashanti]] based on the culture) (0.477 ± 0.12 or 59.7% of the Jamaican population with a 2.7 chance of Pygmy and Sahelian mixture), suggesting that the people from this region may have been consistently prolific throughout the slave era on Jamaica. The diminutive admixture coefficients associated with the Bight of Biafra and West-central Africa (0.064 ± 0.05 and 0.089 ± 0.05, respectively) is striking considering the massive influx of individuals from these areas in the waning years of the British Slave trade. When excluding the pygmy groups, the contribution from the Bight of Biafra and West-central rise to their highest levels (0.095 ± 0.08 and 0.109 ± 0.06, respectively), though still far from a major contribution. When admixture coefficients were calculated by assessing shared haplotypes, the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]]also had the largest contribution, though much less striking at 0.196, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.189 to 0.203. When haplotypes are allowed to differ by one base pair, the Jamaican matriline shows the greatest affinity with the Bight of Benin, though both Bight of Biafra and West-central Africa remain underrepresented. The results of the admixture analysis suggest the mtDNA haplogroup profile distribution of Jamaica more closely resembles that of aggregated populations from the modern day Gold Coast region despite an increasing influx of individuals from both the Bight of Biafra and West-central Africa during the final years of trading enslaved Africans.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-12-24|title=Interdisciplinary approach to the demography of Jamaica|first1=Michael L.|last1=Deason|first2=Antonio|last2=Salas|first3=Simon P.|last3=Newman|first4=Vincent A.|last4=Macaulay|first5=Errol Y. st A.|last5=Morrison|first6=Yannis P.|last6=Pitsiladis|date=23 February 2012|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=24|accessdate=29 August 2017|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results also stated that black Jamaicans(that make up over 90% of the population) on an average have 97.5% of west African MtDNA and very little European or Asian ancestry could be found. Both ethnic and racial genetic results are based on a low sample of 390 Jamaican persons and limited regional representation within Jamaica.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Jamaican Y-DNA===
Pub Med results were also issued in the same year (2012): "Our results reveal that the studied population of Jamaica exhibit a predominantly South-Saharan paternal component, with haplogroups A1b-V152, A3-M32, B2-M182, E1a-M33, E1b1a-M2, E2b-M98, and R1b2-V88 comprising 66.7% of the Jamaican paternal gene pool. Yet, European derived chromosomes (i.e., haplogroups G2a*-P15, I-M258, R1b1b-M269, and T-M184) were detected at commensurate levels in  Jamaica (18.9%), whereas Y-haplogroups indicative of Chinese [O-M175 (3.8%)] and Indian [H-M69 (0.6%) and L-M20 (0.6%)] ancestry were restricted to Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=22576450 | doi=10.1002/ajpa.22090 | volume=148 | title=Y-chromosomal diversity in Haiti and Jamaica: contrasting levels of sex-biased gene flow. | date=Aug 2012 | journal=Am J Phys Anthropol | pages=618–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; African paternal DNA 66.7%

'''Altıntepe''' (Turkish for "golden hill") is an [[Urartu|Urartian]] fortress and temple site dating from the 9th-7th century BCE. It is located on a small hill overlooking the [[Euphrates River]] in the [[Üzümlü]] district of [[Erzincan Province]], [[Turkey]].

Altıntepe is located at the 12th kilometre on the highway from [[Erzincan]] to [[Erzurum]] . The site was discovered in 1938 during the construction of a nearby railway line. The remains are situated on a 60 m-high volcanic hill. During excavations undertaken between 1959-1968 and led by Professor Dr. [[Tahsin Özgüç]], a fortified settlement from the Urartian period was found. In the excavated  area a temple or palace, a great hall, a warehouse, city walls, various rooms, and three subterranean chamber tombs on the south side of the hill were found. After a long gap, excavations were restarted in 2003 by the decision of the [[Council of Ministers of Turkey|Council of Ministers]], under the leadership of Professor Dr. [[Mehmet Karaosmanoğlu]].

The hill was a significant center for the [[Byzantine Empire]] and has a church with three [[nave]]s and [[mosaic]] floors. The church was built on a natural terrace and has a rectangle floor plan. The colorful mosaic floors with various geometric shapes and figures of plants and animals are unique to the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/urartian-city-to-become-open-air-museum-138485 Urartian city to become open-air museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An account of the lives and works of the most eminent Spanish painters, sculptors and architects''''' is a book written by the Spanish painter [[Antonio Palomino]] and dedicated to the biographies of the most eminent artists who worked in Spain during the so-called [[Siglo de Oro]], the golden age of Spanish art.

It was published for the first time in the original Spanish edition in 1724, entitled ''El parnaso español pintoresco y laureado'' and appearing as the third and last volume of Palomino's ''El museo pictorico y escala optica'', featuring also biographies of Italian artists who worked in Spain ([[Pietro Torrigiano]], [[Tiziano]], [[Sofonisba Anguissola]], [[Federico Zuccari]], [[Luca Giordano]] and many others) as well as Flemish artists ([[Antonio Moro]], [[Pieter Paul Rubens]]). The book includes the first biographies ever published of many Spanish artists, [[Diego Velázquez]] among others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/palominoa.htm|title=Palomino de Castro y Velasco, [Acisclo] Antonio|publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=29 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127122412/http://dictionaryofarthistorians.org/palominoa.htm|archive-date=2010-11-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Norbert, Velázquez, Taschen, Köln, 2000, p.95, (Italian edition) {{ISBN|3822864471}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was translated and published in English, French and German during the 18th century; the English translation appeared in 1739.

The book has been described as "the starting point for all students of Spanish painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enggas|first1=Robert|last2=Brown|first2=Jonathan|title=Italian and Spanish Art, 1600-1750: Sources and Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBYnVv2lKY4C&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;ots=NxmfpIbCQW&amp;dq=Palomino%20Velasquez&amp;pg=PA180#v=onepage&amp;q=Palomino&amp;f=false|year=1992|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=0810110652|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Attic funerary relief''', sometimes also known as the '''Mithridates funerary relief''' is displayed at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]] (NAMA), with the inventory number 4464. Its date is uncertain.

==Description==

The [[Pentelic marble]] relief consists of two plates and there must have been a third piece on the left hand side, containing at least the tail of the horse. The central figure of the relief is a horse moving to the right, with its head pulled upwards away from the right edge of the relief. A portion of the horses nose is missing, the only substantial damage to the piece. Its left foreleg is raised and bent, the right is stretched out and planted firmly in the ground. The hind legs reinforce the horse's position, the left hind leg is in very low relief, only barely extending out of the surface. On the horse's back is a panther pelt, which is attached around its front. At the front, to its left, stands a stable boy who reaches up to strike the horse with a whip, as the pained posture of the horse's head makes clear. The boy wears a ''chiton''. His hair is cut short, but the pattern of the locks indicates that he is an exotic foreigner. It is probably that he is an African [[slave]], most likely from [[Ethiopia]].

Arabs and Africans were depicted in [[Greek art]] from the fourth century BC. In addition to this example, the 2 metre high, 1.9 meter wide relief found in 1948 near the Larisa metro-station must date to near the end of the fourth century BC. Other datings assign the relief to the first century BC. If one takes the earlier dating it is assumed that the relief belonged to a large grave [[naiskos]]; supporters of the later dating often connect it with the funerary monument of King [[Mithridates VI]] of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]].

'''Bara''' is a village in [[Rupnagar district|Rupnagar]] District in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[India]]. The village has mainly two Jatt Sikh surnames Chakkal and Heer and lies on the Rupnagar-[[Morinda, India|Morinda]] Road at the left bank of a seasonal monsoon rivulet called [[Budki Nadi]], about four kilometers south-west of the city [[Ropar]] and {{Convert|40|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Chandigarh]] on [[National Highway 205 (India)]] (NH-205). &lt;ref name="ref38zalux"&gt;{{Citation | title=Gleanings of Indian archaeology, history, and culture |author1=K.D.

'''Bilbao''' is a [[Mesoamerica]]n archaeological site about {{convert|1|mi|km}} from the modern town of [[Santa Lucía Cotzumalguapa]] in the [[Escuintla Department|Escuintla]] department of [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1996, p. 227. Kelly 1996, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The site lies among sugar plantations on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coastal plain and its principal phase of occupation is dated to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer 2000, pp. 482-3. Adams 1996, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Bilbao was a major centre belonging to the [[Cotzumalhuapa]] culture with its main occupation dating to the Late Classic (c. AD 600&amp;ndash;800).&lt;ref&gt;Sharer 2000, pp. 482-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Bilbao is the former name of the plantation on which the site lies and from which it has derived its name.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Bilbao lies of the outskirts of Santa Lucía Cotzumalguapa, situated approximately {{convert|370|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;Benítez et al 1993, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological sites of Bilbao, [[El Baúl]] and [[El Castillo (Mesoamerican site)|El Castillo]] were all parts of the same urban centre that extended over about {{convert|10|km2|sqmi}}. This extended urban area is known as the Cotzumalhuapa Nuclear Zone by archaeologists and Bilbao lies in the southernmost part of this area. The urban growth of modern Santa Lucía Cotzumalguapa has expanded to the edge of the monumental architecture of the site.&lt;ref name="Chinchilla"&gt;Chinchilla 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant geographical feature close to the Cotzumalhaupa Nuclear Zone is the [[Volcán de Fuego]], one of the most active volcanoes in the world, its crater rising to an altitude of {{convert|3835|m|ft}} above mean sea level at only a distance of about {{convert|21|km|mi}} from Bilbao itself. The activity of the volcano must have impacted upon the population of the site, which must regularly have suffered from falls of [[volcanic ash]], affecting agriculture, transport routes and perishable dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 2006, p. 119-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Preclassic Period===
Bilbao was occupied since the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic]] and was the most important site dating to the Preclassic within what became in later periods the Cotzumalhuapa Nuclear Zone.&lt;ref name="Chinchilla" /&gt;

===Classic Period===
A substantial quantity of Middle Classic and Late Classic ceramics were found in mixed deposits at Bilbao.&lt;ref name="Chinchilla" /&gt;

===Postclassic Period===
Although Postclassic remains are found close to the surface in various parts of the Cotzumalhuapa Nuclear Zone, Bilbao has a residential compound that is the only major structure dating to this period within the Zone.&lt;ref name="Chinchilla" /&gt;

===Modern history===
The land containing the archaeological remains was cleared in 1860 by Pedro de Anda, a local civic official, to establish a coffee plantation by the name of Finca Peor es Nada. In 1890 Finca Bilbao was formed from the merging of Finca Peor es Nada with another plot of land. The plantation was renamed to Finca Las Ilusiones in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, pp. 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian physician Simeon Habel drew some of the sculptures at Bilbao in 1863, his drawings were published by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1878. Adolph Bastian of the [[Altes Museum|Royal Museum]] in [[Berlin]] visited the site in 1876 and entered into a contract with Pedro de Anda to explore the remains. At this time Carl H. Berendt was hired to move the finest monuments to the Royal Museum in 1877. The monuments were shipped from [[Puerto San José]] on the Pacific coast, where one of the monuments was lost overboard. The rest arrived in Berlin in 1883 and totalled 31 in all, including some well-preserved stelae depicting ballplayers.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884 engineer Albert Napp mapped the site, his original map being lost for more than a century before being found in 1994 in Berlin.&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos_c"&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The site==
The architectural remains consist of earth mounds covered by [[sugarcane]] plantations.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt; The sculptural style of the site differs from that of the Classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and may represent the vanguard of the [[Nahuatl dialects|Nahua]]-speaking [[Pipil people|Pipil]] who migrated from central [[Mexico]] and settled the Pacific coastal plain of Guatemala and [[El Salvador]] in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic Period]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer 2000, pp. 483-484.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican influence evident at Bilbao may not have arrived directly but could instead have been transmitted via a neighbouring polity such as groups from the [[Tiquisate]] or [[La Gomera, Escuintla|La Gomera]] areas of the Guatemalan Pacific coastal region.&lt;ref name="Rubio"&gt;Rubio 1994, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

When first discovered the site was covered in forest, this was cleared for coffee plantations that have since been replaced with sugarcane.&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos_a"&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological investigations were carried out by Lee A. Parsons and S. F. de Borhegyi. Parsons has suggested that Bilbao was a colony founded during the Middle Classic (c. 400&amp;ndash;550) by the distant metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]], with [[El Tajín]] as an intermediary, and that it became independent between AD 550 and 700.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1996, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; However, archaeologist Marion Popenoe de Hatch has since redated the site to the Late Classic period.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;Adams 1996, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Bilbao's architecture is buried under a thick layer of volcanic soil to an extent that only the largest structures can be distinguished as mounds.&lt;ref&gt;Chinchilla 2002, p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of Bilbao is formed by a series of platforms that descend gradually to the south. These platforms do not have any surviving evidence of boundary walls and appear to have been open and accessible. The monumental architecture of Bilbao may have served as an elite residential compound and a place of worship.&lt;ref name=CM514&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 1998, p. 514. Chinchilla Mazariegos 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monument Plaza''' contained the majority of the site's sculpture, including Monuments 1 through to 8, a group of stelae now in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, pp. 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; The Plaza was externally accessible via ramps and stairways.&lt;ref name=CM514/&gt;

'''Group A''' lies immediately to the west of the Monument Plaza and contains 6 structures.&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos"&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Group B''' is immediately to the north of Group A and contains 4 structures.&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos" /&gt;

'''Group C''' is immediately north of Group B and possesses 3 structures.&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos" /&gt;

'''Group D''' is immediately north of Group C and contains 4 structures.&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos" /&gt;

Groups A to D are all bordered on the east side by the Canilla River.&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos" /&gt;

===Causeways===
Bilbao is connected to other sites in the Cotzumalhuapa Nuclear Zone by a system of stone-paved avenues, reinforcing the interpretation of the Zone as an articulated urban centre. There are three major causeways:&lt;ref name="Chinchilla" /&gt;

The '''Gavarrete Causeway''' is {{convert|3|km|mi}} long and links Bilbao with El Baúl.&lt;ref name="Chinchilla" /&gt; It was the main avenue of the city and varied between {{convert|11|and|14|m|ft}} wide. The causeway is named after Guatemalan historian Juan Gavarrete.&lt;ref&gt;Chinchilla 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berendt Causeway''' is an extension of the Gavarrete Causeway that links Bilbao with El Castillo, it is {{convert|1|km|mi}} long.&lt;ref name="Chinchilla" /&gt;

The '''Habel Causeway''' is {{convert|2|km|mi}} long and links El Castillo with Golón, only {{convert|1|km|mi}} from Bilbao itself.&lt;ref name="Chinchilla" /&gt;

===Sculpture===
[[Image:Bilbao 2.jpg|thumb|left|Monument 19 at Bilbao.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio 1994, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
58 monuments were listed by Parsons at Bilbao,&lt;ref name="Kelly_a" /&gt; but only 3 remain ''in situ'' in Bilbao's Monument Plaza.&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos_a" /&gt; Even before the extraction of the majority of the sculptures in the 19th century, many had already been damaged by locals who quarried them as a source of construction material.&lt;ref&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining boulder sculptures of Bilbao lie among the earth mounds of the site's ceremonial centre; they include two sculptures of the central Mexican [[deity]] [[Tlaloc]] carved into a boulder by a stream.&lt;ref name="Adams" /&gt; A significant amount of the architecture and  [[relief]] sculpture  at the site features [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballgame]] imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Cohodas 1991, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Ballgame reliefs at Bilbao feature blossoming and fruiting plants symbolic of agricultural fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie 1991, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; Stelae at Bilbao depict ballplayers with disembodied heads and various sculptures depict dismembered body parts.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie 1991, pp. 322, 334.&lt;/ref&gt; Sculptures of dismembered limbs are carved in the round and show the bones protruding.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons 1991, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-preserved examples of [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] [[potbelly sculpture]]s have been found at Bilbao. These are boulders carved to represent obese human figures and are found at many sites along the Pacific coast.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monument 1''' dates to the Classic Period. It depicts a ballplayer wielding a knife in one hand and a severed head in the other. This figure stands on a dismembered human torso lacking limbs and head. Around the main figure are four smaller figures, also carrying severed heads.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie 1991, pp. 334-5.&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally found in the Monument Plaza but was removed to the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos_b"&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, pp. 214-216.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monument 2''' was located in the Monument Plaza and was removed to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos_b" /&gt;

[[File:Cozumalhuapakultur Ethnologisches Museum Berlin 01.JPG|thumb|right|Monument 3 in the Ethnological Museum of Berlin]]
'''Monument 3''' depicts a larger ballplayer figure and a smaller death god, both of whom are wearing ballgame yokes, standing in front of a temple. The ballplayer is offering a human heart to the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio 1994, p. 93. Miller 2001, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The monument was found in the Monument Plaza but was removed to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos_b" /&gt;

'''Monument 4''' depicts a shaman whose tongue is in the form of a knife.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio 1994, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; It was located in the Monument Plaza and was removed to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos_b" /&gt;

'''Monument 5''', '''Monument 6''', '''Monument 7''' and '''Monument 8''' were all from the Monument Plaza and were removed to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos_b" /&gt;

'''Monument 16''' is one of the few sculptures to remain at the site, being located in a sugarcane field.&lt;ref name="Chinchilla" /&gt;

'''Monument 17''' was lost overboard when it was being loaded onto a ship for transport to Berlin. The sculpture was one of a pair and depicted a vulture devouring a human torso. Only the tip of one wing survived and is stored in the museum warehouse.&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos_c" /&gt;

'''Monument 18''' is a large sculptured stela that is roughly rectangular in shape and has a raised border. It depicts three standing figures. The left-most figure faces the other two on its right. Between the left figure and the central figure is a rectangular object sprouting crab claws at the bottom. There is a circle containing the head of a monkey at the top of the sculpture. Monument 18 has been dated to the Classic period.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt; Monument 18 was located on the west side of Mound 4 of Group B.&lt;ref&gt;Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, pp. 222, 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monument 19''' depicts three figures, the principal individual wears an elaborate headdress with a [[Xiuhcoatl]] ("turquoise/fire serpent") plume. He appears to be offering aid to a less fortunate person.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio 1994, pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bilbao, Escuintla, Monument 21 detail.jpg|thumb|right|Figure seated on a throne on Monument&amp;nbsp;21]]
'''Monument 21''' is a basalt boulder in a sugarcane field. The boulder has an artificially flattened upper surface bearing a bas-relief sculpture. The carved face has a 35° slope and measures {{convert|11|by|13|ft|m}}. The sculpture depicts three main figures. The central figure is the largest and faces towards a second figure seated on a throne. The third figure is behind the central figure, it is smaller and holds a hand puppet. The scene is filled out with twisting vines that sprout [[cocoa pod]]s bearing human faces. Other details of the monument include birds, snakes and a butterfly with a human head. Monument 21 has been dated to the Classic period.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt; Monument 21 is located east of Mound 2, in the centre of Group B.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio 1994, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The decoration on the skirt of one of the figures may be the face of the central Mexican deity [[Xipe Totec]].&lt;ref name="Rubio" /&gt;

'''Monument 24''' was moved to the [[Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología]] in [[Guatemala City]].&lt;ref name="ChinchillaMazariegos_a" /&gt;

'''Monument 46''' is a potbelly sculpture.&lt;ref name="McInnisThompson"&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monument 47''' is a potbelly sculpture.&lt;ref name="McInnisThompson" /&gt;

'''Monument 58''' is a potbelly sculpture. When it was excavated by Parsons it was found lying on its side with its head resting upon the lowest step of a stairway with Monument 59 (a throne or altar) upside down on top of it. The potbelly sculpture may originally have sat upon the throne. Alternatively, it may have been set at the base of the stairway with the throne at the top.&lt;ref&gt;McInnis Thompson &amp; Valdez 2008, pp. 13, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monument 59''' is a stone altar or throne with four legs. It was found resting inverted on top of Monument 58, a potbelly sculpture, at the bottom of a stairway. It may originally have supported this potbelly monument.&lt;ref&gt;p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golón===
Golón is an important area within the Cotzumalhuapa Nuclear Zone, located {{convert|1|km|mi}} from Bilbao and connected to the same system of paved causeways. Golón is an area that contains further [[monumental sculpture]].&lt;ref name="Chinchilla" /&gt;

'''Breton Liberty''' (Breton:  ''Frankiz Breizh'', French: ''Liberté Bretagne'') was a leftist national liberation movement in [[Brittany]], France. It split off from the [[Breton Democratic Union]], though the two parties' political stances were similar. Breton Liberty frequently worked within the [[Régions et Peuples Solidaires]] federation. Its activities were limited to the city of [[Brest, France|Brest]] (where it held a vice-mayor seat) and surrounding region of Léon and during its last years it did not have more than a dozen active member. The party was dissolved in 2007, and some of its members joined the [[Breton Democratic Union]].

The '''Brudevælte Lurs''', found in a bog north of [[Lynge, Allerød Municipality|Lynge]] on the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Zealand]], are six [[lur]]s, which are so well preserved that they can still be played.

==History==
The three pairs of lurs were found by a farmer in 1797 in a turf grave in a bog which has since been drained. It was the first [[hoard]] of Lurs ever discovered, and also the largest and most important.

==Description==
The length of the Lurs ranges between 1.5 and 2.2 metres. They have different tunes from one another and were made around 800-700 BC. The Danish archaeologist [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen]] (1788-1865) was the first to refer to the bronze instruments with the [[Old Norse]] word ''luðr'', before that they were referred to as "horns".

Most lurs are found as hoards. That they had great cultural significance is indicated by hoards with a cultic context and by the frequent depiction of Lur-players on Scandinavian [[Bronze Age]] [[rock art]]. In these depictions the lur-players are usually depicted as pairs and, as a rule, lurs are found in pairs. These pairs are always tuned to the same tone. The tone sequence is based on [[just intonation]]; a good player can produce a wide tonal range. The sound of the lurs is powerful and piercing, similar to the [[trombone]].

The lurs consist of an S-shaped pipe made of several pieces that have been welded together, a sound-board at the upper end and a mouthpiece at the lower end. The lurs were cast from bronze with a level of craftsmanship so high that it is still not entirely clear to modern scholars how they achieved such perfection with the quality of casting technology available to them.

==Exhibition==
Five of the Brudevælte lurs are found in the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]]. The sixth was given to the [[Russia]]n Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] in 1845.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6322">[[File:Australian Senate - Parliament of Australia.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Australian Senate]], like other parliaments based on the Westminster system, uses a divided chamber]]

In [[politics]], '''crossing the floor''' is when a politician changes their allegiance or votes against their party in a [[Westminster system]] parliament. Crossing the floor may be voting against the approved party lines, or changing to another party after being elected while a member of a first party. While these practices are legally permissible, crossing the floor can lead to controversy and media attention. As well, voting against party lines may lead to consequences such as losing a position (e.g., as minister or a portfolio critic) or being ejected from the party caucus.  [[Maldives]] and [[Bangladesh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/sections_detail.php?id=367&amp;sections_id=24624 |title= Article 70(b) of Constitution of People's Republic of Bangladesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; have laws which removes the member from parliament due to floor-crossing.

==Etymology==
The term originates from the [[British House of Commons]], which is configured with the Government and [[Parliamentary Opposition|Opposition]] facing each other on rows of benches. In consequence, an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] who switches from the governing party to one in opposition (or vice versa) also changes which side of the chamber they sit on. A notable example of this is [[Winston Churchill]], who crossed the floor from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] to the [[Liberal party (UK)|Liberals]] in 1904, before later crossing back in 1924.

==Voting against party lines==
The term has passed into general use in other [[Westminster System|Westminster]] parliamentary democracies (such as [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], [[Politics of Australia|Australia]], [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Politics of South Africa|South Africa]]) even if many of these countries have semicircular or horseshoe-shaped debating chambers and mechanisms for voting without [[Members of Parliament]] leaving their seats. In most countries, it is most often used to describe members of the government party or parties who defect and vote with the opposition against some piece of government-sponsored legislation, but that usage is not widespread in Canada, where the term's usage is restricted to the original definition.

Most political parties let their members have a free vote on some matters of personal conscience.

In Australia, one of the major parties (the [[Australian Labor Party]]) requires its members to pledge their support for the collective decisions of the Caucus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22library%2Fprspub%2F31KH6%22 |title=Crossing the floor in the Federal Parliament 1950 – August 2004 |work=Research Note no. 11 2005–06 |publisher=Australian Parliament |date=October 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; which theoretically prohibits them from crossing the floor; however, in practice, some Labor members disregard this pledge despite the disciplinary action which may result. Among other parties, crossing the floor is rare although former Senator [[Barnaby Joyce]] of the [[National Party of Australia]] crossed the floor 19 times under the Howard coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/independently-inclined-20080530-2jzv.html?page=2 |title=Independently inclined |publisher=The Age |first=Penelope |last=Debelle |date=May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the record for crossing the floor in the Australian Parliament goes to Tasmanian Senator Sir [[Reg Wright]], who voted against his own party (the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]) on 150 occasions.

==Changing parties==
In the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries, the term is also used to describe leaving one's party entirely and joining another party, such as leaving an opposition party to support the government (or vice versa), or even leaving one opposition party to join another. In both Canada and the United Kingdom, the term carries only this meaning and is not used for a simple vote against the party line on a bill.

In April 2006, the premier of [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]], [[Gary Doer]] of the [[New Democratic Party of Manitoba]], proposed a ban on crossing the floor of the Manitoba legislature in response to "the concern some voters have expressed over the high-profile defections of three federal MPs from their parties in just over two years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/reddeer/story.html?id=3d05619e-313e-4cce-a7a2-f5beed56b228&amp;k=3864 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323022203/http://www.canada.com/cityguides/reddeer/story.html?id=3d05619e-313e-4cce-a7a2-f5beed56b228&amp;k=3864 |archivedate=March 23, 2007|title=Proposed reforms would ban floor-crossing in Man. |first=Michelle |last=Macafee |publisher=Canadian Press |date=April 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting legislation, which amended the provincial ''Legislative Assembly Act'', mandated that Members of the Legislature who quit their political party must serve out the remainder of their term as independents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/2006/c01506ee.php |title=The Elections Reform Act - Schedule E |work=Statutes of Manitoba |publisher=Manitoba Laws |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extraordinary example occurred in Alberta, Canada in December 2014 when [[Danielle Smith]], the leader of the official opposition [[Wildrose Party]], and eight of her MLAs crossed the floor together to join the governing [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnews.ca/news/1737886/danielle-smiths-move-to-pcs-unprecedented/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cruciform passage graves''' describe a complex example of prehistoric [[passage grave]] found in [[Ireland]], west [[Wales]] and [[Orkney]] and built during the later [[Neolithic]], from around 3500 BC and later.

They are distinguished by a long passage  leading to a central chamber with a [[corbel]]led roof. From this, burial chambers extend in three directions, giving the overall impression in plan of a cross shape layout. Some examples have further sub-chambers leading off the three original chambers. The network of chambers is covered by a [[cairn]] and revetted with a [[Megalithic architectural elements|kerb]].

A common trait is [[megalithic art]] carved into the stones of the chambers' walls and roofs. Abstract designs were favoured, especially spirals and zig-zags.

Examples are [[Newgrange]] in Ireland, [[Maeshowe]] in Orkney and [[Barclodiad y Gawres]] in [[Anglesey]].

'''Eric Morris''' (born November 19, 1931) is an [[Americans|American]] [[acting]] [[teacher]] and [[actor]] who founded his own theory of acting based on the works of [[Lee Strasberg]] and [[Martin Landau]]. Morris lives with his wife in [[Los Angeles]] and teaches actors the Eric Morris System of Acting.

==Early life==
His parents were [[Russian Immigrants]]; his father emigrated from [[Russia]] to the United States in 1912.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Eric lived with his family in various apartments in a neighborhood inhabited chiefly by Jewish immigrants from Russia or Poland until, in seventh grade, when his father bought a house.

He spent some years as a Boy Scout, attaining the rank of Star Scout. He was a soda jerk at Walgreens, and at age fourteen spent some Saturdays doing stand-up comedy at a mafia nightclub.  After a false start and a detour in therapy, Morris returned to [[Wright Junior College]] in 1950 and took up drama.  He enrolled at [[Northwestern University School of Speech]] in 1952, as a [[Junior (education)|junior]] theater major.  [[Alvina Krause]] taught him acting, though he reports she did not like him; he got a "C" in the class.  In 1978 he bought a house at [[Lake Arrowhead, California|Lake Arrowhead]], fulfilling a wish he had made as a ten-year-old in 1941.&lt;ref name="Autobiography" /&gt;

==The Eric Morris System==
Having published over six books in his theory, Morris claims that his System is derived partly from Lee Strasberg's [[Method Acting]]. However, Strasberg's Method focuses too much on craft, according to Morris, and not enough on the actor's instrument. Facing struggle in finding truth, he contemplated his theory while heading the Directors Unit at the Actor's Studio in Los Angeles. Morris' method recognizes the fact that actors have emotional blocks, tension, insecurities and other preventions to achieving a fundamental state of being, and works to clear these blocks, rendering the actor truly organic. In this sense, Morris stresses that acting is essentially living and being.

There are seven major obligations to material, according to Eric: 1) Time and Place, 2) Relationship, 3) Emotional Obligation, 4) Character Obligation, 5) Historic Obligation, 6) Thematic Obligation, 7) Subtextual Obligation. After recognizing these 7 obligations, there are the choices the actor utilizes to render these emotions, and finally the approach to which the actors use these choices.

The Eric Morris System has received praise from such actors as [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Johnny Depp]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Acting career==
Morris has been acting since 1949. He is an original member of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] since 1954. He has worked in over 100 equity plays on stages across the US, including such stages as the [[Globe Theater]] and Chicago Rep. Morris has also worked in several [[television]] shows, including ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'', ''[[The New Phil Silvers Show]]'' and ''[[Fame (1982 TV series)|Fame]]''. Furthermore, Morris has worked in over 25 major motion pictures, including ''[[Pork Chop Hill]]'',{{Citation needed|reason=listed on his website but not IMDb|date=December 2013}} ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' and ''[[Mirage (1995 film)|Mirage]].''

[[File:Newark Museum Explorers Logo.jpg|thumb|Newark Museum Explorers Program logo.]]

The '''Newark Museum Explorers Program''' is a year-round work-based, college-preparatory, and mentoring program that supports Newark high school students in their exploration of the sciences and humanities, and pursuit of a college education. The program is run from the [[Newark Museum]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]], United States.

==History==
In 1995, the Science Explorer’s Program was the recipient of a start-up grant under the YouthAlive! Project, a national initiative, funded by the DeWitt Wallace Readers Digest Fund in partnership with the [[Association of Science-Technology Centers]] (ASTC). The initiative called for the development of programs in museums that could provide positive work and learning opportunities for young people.

The [[Newark Museum]], in keeping with its long history of actively addressing the needs of its community, designed such a program. Through the years, the Explorers’ program has evolved into a successful college and job preparedness program that provides invaluable education, employment, and mentoring opportunities to urban youth.

The Newark Museum Explorers Program is also a recipient of a grant provided by the [[Rivendell Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fdnweb.org/rivendell/ | title=Rivendell Foundation | accessdate=2 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meetings and workshops==
Explorers meet regularly for workshops, meetings and training sessions prior to each festival. Workshops offered in the past includes public speaking workshops, financial literacy workshops, glass art workshops, etiquette workshops, animation workshops, mural painting, soap and candle making workshops.

Meetings, workshops scheduled by program coordinator and field trips supersedes internship duties. If a meeting, field trip or workshop conflicts with Explorer’s internship schedule, it is the Explorer’s responsibility to inform their supervisor of the existing conflict in schedule.

Explorers are expected to participate in all meetings, workshops and field trips throughout their participation in the program. Attendance and participation in these events are vital parts of each student’s experience and their continuation to participate in the Program.

==Internships==
To equip students with employable skills, students will have the opportunity to work in different departments at the Newark Museum and other partnering organizations during their internships as well as varying museum activities, events and festivals.

Explorers are assigned mentors who supervise them through the acquisition of employable skills in different departments, events and festivals such as:
*''weekend family arts and science activities, Science Department, Dynamic Earth, Membership, Exhibits, Special Events, Junior Museum, Planetarium, Visitor Services, Museum Library, School Programs, and Museum Shop. Explorers work for about 4 hours per week during the school year, and about 20 hours per week during the summer.''{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Students have the opportunity to work in different departments as well as varying museum activities, festivals and events in order to gain employable skills.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

''The Explorers Program is a job preparedness program. Therefore, students are not compensated for participation in workshops, trainings and field trips.''{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Field trips==
Explorers are engaged in outdoor education through several field trips. In the past, Explorers have taken trips to [[The Bronx Zoo]], [[New York Aquarium]], CSI: The Experience, Bodies Exhibit, Mural Tour of Philadelphia, [[Metropolitan Museum of Arts]], [[World Series of Birding]], Osprey Banding in Maryland, [[American Museum of Natural History]] and the [[Wax Museum]]. Explorers have also visited colleges such as [[Yale]], [[Columbia University]], [[Montclair University]], [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[New York University]] and [[The College of New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

At the end of each year, graduating classes attend a 3-day senior trip. In the past, the graduating Explorers have visited Puerto Rico, 1000 Acres Ranch Resort New York, Baltimore, Maryland, and Montreal, Canada.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Alumni==
Since its inception in 1994, the Explorers Program has maintained a 90% retention rate. The Explorers Program gives students a stronger leadership background and opens up doors that these students never thought they could walk through. Students leave the program with new found courage, leadership, and skills they might never have attained without the help of this program.&lt;ref name="nash" /&gt;

During the course of the year, each student attends an average of 80 meetings, a minimum of 10 additional training sessions and log in about 320 internship hours. The students’ participation and retention in the program indicates that they are enjoying the program.

The Explorers program maintained a 95% retention rate in 2012–13. The program has maintained a 100% high school graduation and college attendance for five years from 2008.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

225 students have graduated from the Explorers program since its conception in 1995, and have been attending an institution of higher education within 12 months of their high school graduation.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The alumni component is vital to track long term success of the program. This component will include annual luncheons open to all alumni. This luncheon aims to be aware of the Alumnus progress and create a mentoring opportunity for the program. This component will also host an alumni reunion every 2–3 years. The Explorers Peer Mentor will oversee Explorers Alumni affairs.

Some alumni attend leading institutions of higher learning such as [[Harvard Law School]], [[Princeton University]], [[Columbia University]], and [[Cornell University]], where they studied:
*''nursing, engineering, medicine, chemistry, mathematics, education, architecture, microbiology, cell biology, Biochemistry, Graphic design, International Relations, Sociology, Biology and nutrition , business, and computer graphics, just to mention a few.''{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Among professions represented by alumni include:
*''lawyers, educators, graphic designers, entrepreneurs, motion capture animator, mental health Councilor, registered nurse, licensed optician, crisis councilor, accounts executive, banker, financial specialist, software engineer, pharmacist, hospitality and management, diplomacy consultant''{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Features==
The program’s features include:{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

* Personalized college guidance
* Connections to Museum professionals
* Access to exhibition designers and outstanding art and science collections
* Presentations by working scientists and researchers
* Field trips and related trainings at the region’s wildlife reserves 
* Opportunities to apply scientific principles

Over a three-year period, the program nurtures the students’ academic development and career aspirations.&lt;ref name="nash"&gt;{{cite news| last=Nash | first=Margo |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/04/nyregion/museums-minorities-learning-more-than-science-at-museum.html | title=Museums; Minorities Learning More Than Science At Museum | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | date=February 4, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Program activities occur during after school hours (3.30–5.00pm), on weekends from 9 to 5 pm, during June and July, and school breaks.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

__TOC__

== Life and career ==
Henry Hare Carter was born on June 28, 1905, in [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to John Hanford and Elizabeth Carter (née Ensminger). He married Gloria Maria Castello Branco de Gouveia (deceased May 16, 2015) in [[Recife]], [[Brazil]] in 1946.

Professor Carter received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]], [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] &amp; Ph.D.&lt;ref name=NDfac/&gt; degrees from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in years 1928, 1931 and 1937.&lt;ref name=NDfac/&gt; Dr. Carter was a professor of [[romance languages]] for almost 40 years at several colleges and universities, including the [[University of Pennsylvania]]; [[Northwestern University|Northwestern University, Evanston]]; the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]]; [[DePaul University]]; [[Colorado College]]; and for the last 24 years of teaching (from 1956) at the [[University of Notre Dame]]&lt;ref name=NDfac/&gt; in [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], [[Indiana]], where he retired as [[Professor Emeritus]] of Romance Languages and Literatures.&lt;ref name=NDfac/&gt;

Among his teaching specialities were [[Spanish literature]]; the history of the [[Spanish language]]; and Spanish poetry, drama, and prose. He spoke seven languages.

During his student days, he would often travel and study abroad during the summers in [[Europe]] with foreign studies,&lt;ref name=NDfac/&gt; including [[Madrid]] in 1931, the [[Sorbonne]] ([[Paris]]) in 1933, ''[[Corsi Roma]]'' ([[Rome]]) 1937, and [[Coimbra]], [[Portugal]] in 1939.&lt;ref name=NDfac/&gt;

For most of his professional life he was interested in the translation of 12th- and 13th-century manuscripts, written by [[monks]], about the stories of [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and the [[Holy Grail]], and the legend of [[El Cid]]. He also was a [[Reconnaissance|scout]] on his travels in [[South America]] and [[Spain]] for new Spanish words to be included in the Williams' Spanish-English Dictionary. His endorsement of the book was included on the front cover of the paperback edition.

Henry Carter was elected to numerous [[academies]], both in the [[United States]] and abroad, including: the Brazilian Academy of Philology (1971),&lt;ref name=NDfac/&gt; the Academy of Sciences, Lisbon (1975),&lt;ref name=NDfac/&gt; and ''Académico de Mérito'', in the Portuguese Academy of History (1989).&lt;ref name=NDfac/&gt;

During [[World War II]], he was assigned to the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]]; serving in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Puerto Rico]], and Brazil, where he was the liaison officer between the American and Brazilian navies. He retired from the [[US Naval Reserve]] with the rank of commander. During his Navy years, he wrote ''Paleographical Edition and Study of the Language of a Portion of Codex Alcobacensis 200'' and ''Cancioneiro da Ajuda: A Diplomatic Edition'' (1941).

In retirement, Professor Carter resided with the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] at Moreau Seminary, where he regularly shared stories of the obscure origins of words and delighted generations of seminarians.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

He died in 2001 and was survived by his daughter, Christina Elizabeth Daltro, living in Porto das Dunas, Aquiraz, Ceará, Brazil and in Ocean Springs, MS, and his son, Bruce Edward de Gouveia Carter (deceased November 2014), grandchildren Elithea Van Note, Leana Carter and Tony Carter, living in the US, and Claudia Daltro de Souza and Sylvia Daltro de Souza, both from São Paulo and Brasilia, Brazil; a great-grandson, Henry William Van Note, a great-granddaughter, Clara Evangeline Van Note, both of Moline, IL, a great-grandson Caian Daltro Salgado, Claudia's son, living in São Paulo, Brazil, and twin grandchildren Julia and Lucas Daltro Perreira, living in Brasília-DF, Brazil, Christina Elizabeth Carter Daltro's grandchildren.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52637">The term "[[Latin America]]" primarily refers to the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries in the [[New World]].

Before the [[European colonization of the Americas|arrival of Europeans]] in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, the region was home to many indigenous peoples, a number of which had advanced civilizations, most notably from North to South; the [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Muisca people|Muisca]] and [[Inca civilization|Inca]]. 
[[File:America noviter delineata.jpg|thumb|220px|A 17th-century map of the Americas]]

The region came under control of the crowns of Spain and Portugal, which imposed both [[Roman Catholicism]] and their respective languages. Both the Spanish and the Portuguese brought African slaves to their colonies, as laborers, particularly in regions where indigenous populations who could be made to work were absent.

In the early nineteenth century nearly all of areas of Spanish America attained independence by armed struggle, with the exceptions of Cuba and Puerto Rico. Brazil, which had become a monarchy separate from Portugal, became a republic in the late nineteenth century. Political independence from European monarchies did not result in the abolition of black slavery in the new sovereign nations. Political independence resulted in political and economic instability in Spanish America immediately after independence.  Great Britain and the United States exercised significant influence in the post-independence era, resulting in a form of [[neo-colonialism]], whereby a country's political sovereignty remained in place, but foreign powers exercised considerable power in the economic sphere.

==Origin of the term and definition==
{{See also|Latin America#Etymology and definitions|l1=Latin America: Definition}}

The idea that a part of the Americas has a cultural or [[Social interpretations of race|racial]] affinity with all Romance cultures can be traced back to the 1830s, in particular in the writing of the French [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonian]] [[Michel Chevalier]], who postulated that this part of the Americas were inhabited by people of a "[[Italic peoples|Latin race]]," and that it could, therefore, ally itself with "[[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin Europe]]" in a struggle with "[[Germanic languages|Teutonic Europe]]," "[[Anglo America|Anglo-Saxon America]]" and "[[Slav]]ic Europe."&lt;ref name = "mignolo"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mignolo | first = Walter | title = The Idea of Latin America | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vPacXtsWhewC | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | place = Oxford | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-4051-0086-1 |pages = 77–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was later taken up by Latin American intellectuals and political leaders of the mid- and late-nineteenth century, who no longer looked to Spain or Portugal as cultural models, but rather to France.&lt;ref&gt;McGuiness, Aims (2003). "Searching for 'Latin America': Race and Sovereignty in the Americas in the 1850s" in Appelbaum, Nancy P. et al. (eds.). ''Race and Nation in Modern Latin America''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 87-107. {{ISBN|0-8078-5441-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual term "Latin America" was coined in France under [[Napoleon III]] and played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area and install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] as emperor of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chasteen | first = John Charles | authorlink = John Charles Chasteen | title = Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America | publisher = W. W. Norton | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-393-97613-0 | page = 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-twentieth century, especially in the United States, there was a trend to occasionally classify all of the territory south of the United States as "Latin America," especially when the discussion focused on its contemporary political and economic relations to the rest of the world, rather than solely on its cultural aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butland | first = Gilbert J. | authorlink = | title = Latin America: A Regional Geography | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | year = 1960 | location = New York | pages = 115–188 | isbn = 0-470-12658-2 }} {{cite book | last = Dozer | first = Donald Marquand | title = Latin America: An Interpretive History | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1962 | location = New York | pages = 1–15 }} {{cite book | last = Szulc | first = Tad | authorlink = Tad Szulc | title = Latin America | publisher = New York Times Company | year = 1965 | pages = 13–17}} {{cite book | last = Olien | first = Michael D. | authorlink = | title = Latin Americans: Contemporary Peoples and Their Cultural Traditions | publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston | year = 1973 | location = New York | pages = 1–5 | isbn = 0-03-086251-5}} {{cite book | last = Black | first = Jan Knippers (ed.) | authorlink = | title = Latin America: Its Problems and Its Promise: A Multidisciplinary Introduction | publisher = Westview Press | year = 1984| location = Boulder | pages = 362–378 | isbn = 0-86531-213-3}} {{cite book | last = Bruns | first = E.

Since, the concept and definitions of Latin American are very modern, going back only to the nineteenth century, it is anachronistic to talk about "a history of Latin America" before the arrival of the Europeans. Nevertheless, the many and varied cultures that did exist in the [[pre-Columbian]] period had a strong and direct influence on the societies that emerged as a result of the conquest, and therefore, they cannot be overlooked. They are introduced in the next section.

==The Pre-Columbian period==
{{Main article|Pre-Columbian}}
What is now Latin America has been populated for several millennia, possibly for as long as 30,000 years. There are many [[models of migration to the New World]]. Precise dating of many of the early civilizations is difficult because there are few text sources. However, highly developed civilizations flourished at various times and places, such as in the [[Andes]] and [[Mesoamerica]].

==Colonial Era==
{{Main article|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}
{{See also|Spanish empire|Historiography of Colonial Spanish America}}
[[Christopher Columbus]] landed in the Americas in 1492. Subsequently, the major sea powers in Europe sent expeditions to the [[New World]] to build trade networks and colonies and to convert the native peoples to [[Christianity]]. Spain concentrated on building its empire on the central and southern parts of the Americas allotted to it by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], because of presence of large, settled societies like the [[Aztec]], the [[Inca civilization|Inca]], the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] and the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], whose human and material resources it could exploit, and large concentrations of [[silver]] and [[gold]]. The Portuguese built their empire in [[Brazil]], which fell in their sphere of influence owing to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], by developing the land for [[sugar]] production since there was a lack of a large, complex society or mineral resources.

During the European colonization of the western hemisphere, most of the native population died, mainly by disease. In what has come to be known as the [[Columbian exchange]], diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]] decimated populations with no immunity. The size of the indigenous populations has been studied in the modern era by historians,&lt;ref&gt;Sherburne F. Cook and Woodrow Borah, ''Essays in Population History'' 3 vols. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1971-1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David P. Henige, ''Numbers from Nowhere: the American Indian Contact Population Debate'', Norman: University of Oklahoma Press 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nobel David Cook, ''Born to Die: Disease and New World Conquest, 1492-1650''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; but Dominican friar [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] raised the alarm in the earliest days of Spanish settlement in the Caribbean in his ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]''.

The conquerors and colonists of Latin America also had a major impact on the population of Latin America. The Spanish conquistadors committed savage acts of violence against the natives. According to [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], the Europeans worked the native population to death, separated the men and the women so they could not reproduce, and hunted down and killed any natives who escaped with dogs. Las Casas claimed that the Spaniards made the natives work day and night in mines and would "test the sharpness of their blades"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zinn |first1=Howard |title=A People's History of the United States |date=2015 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the natives. Las Casas estimated that around three million natives died from war, slavery, and overworking. When talking about the cruelty, Las Casas said "Who in future generations will believe this? I myself writing it as a knowledgeable eyewitness can hardly believe it."

Because the Spanish were now in power, native culture and religion were forbidden. The Spanish even went as far as burning the Maya Codices (like books). These codices contained information about astrology, religion, Gods, and rituals. There are four codices known to exist today; these are the Dresden Codex, Paris Codex, Madrid Codex, and HI Codex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/Maya/p/Maya-Books.htm|title=The Maya Codices|publisher=about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish also melted down countless pieces of golden artwork so they could bring the gold back to Spain and destroyed countless pieces of art that they viewed as unchristian. 

==Colonial-era Religion==

===Traveling to the New World===
The Spanish Crown regulated immigration to its overseas colonies, with travelers required to register with the [[Casa de Contratación|House of Trade]] in Seville. Since the crown wished to exclude anyone who was non-Christian (Jews, [[crypto-Jews]], and Muslims) passing as Christian, travelers' backgrounds were vetted. The ability to regulate the flow of people enabled the Spanish Crown to keep a grip on the religious purity of its overseas empire. The Spanish Crown was rigorous in their attempt to allow only Christians passage to the New World and required proof of religion by way of personal testimonies. Specific examples of individuals dealing with the Crown allow for an understanding of how religion affected passage into the New World.

Francisca de Figueroa, an African-Iberian woman seeking entrance into the Americas, petitioned the Spanish Crown in 1600 in order to gain a license to sail to Cartagena.&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, ''Afro-Latino Voices'' p 52.&lt;/ref&gt; On her behalf she had a witness attest to her religious purity, Elvira de Medina wrote, "this witness knows that she and parents and her grandparents have been and are Old Christians and of unsullied cast and lineage. They are not of Moorish or Jewish caste or of those recently converted to Our Holy Catholic Faith."&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, ''Afro-Latino Voices'' p 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Francisca's race, she was allowed entrance into the Americas in 1601 when a 'Decree from His Majesty' was presented, it read, "My presidents and official judges of the Case de Contraction of Seville. I order you to allow passage to the Province of Cartagena for Francisca de Figueroa ..."&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, ''Afro-Latino Voices'' p 64.&lt;/ref&gt; This example points to the importance of religion when attempting to travel to the Americas during colonial times. Individuals had to work within the guidelines of Christianity in order to appeal to the Crown and be granted access to travel.

===Religion in Latin America===
Once in the New World, religion was still a prevalent issue which had to be considered in everyday life. Many of the laws were based in religious beliefs and traditions and often these laws clashed with the many other cultures throughout colonial Latin America. One of the central clashes was between African and Iberian cultures; this difference in culture resulted in the aggressive prosecution of witches, both African and Iberian, throughout Latin America. According to European tradition "[a] witch&amp;nbsp;– a bruja&amp;nbsp;– was thought to reject God and the sacraments and instead worship the devil and observe the [[witches' Sabbath]]."&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, ''Afro-Latino Voices'' p 176.&lt;/ref&gt; This rejection of God was seen as an abomination and was not tolerated by the authorities either in Spain nor Latin America. A specific example, the trial of [[Paula de Eguiluz]], shows how an appeal to Christianity can help to lessen punishment even in the case of a witch trial.

[[Paula de Eguiluz]] was a woman of African descent who was born in Santo Domingo and grew up as a slave, sometime in her youth she learned the trade of witches and was publicly known to be a sorceress. "In 1623, Paula was accused of [[witchcraft]] (brujeria), divination and apostasy (declarations contrary to Church doctrine)."&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, ''Afro-Latino Voices'' p 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Paula was tried in 1624 and began her hearings without much knowledge of the Crowns way of conducting legal proceedings. There needed to be appeals to Christianity and announcements of faith if an individual hoped to lessen the sentence. Learning quickly, Paula correctly "recited the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, the Salve Regina, and the Ten Commandments" before the second hearing of her trial. Finally, in the third hearing of the trial Paula ended her testimony by "ask[ing] Our Lord to forgive [me] for these dreadful sins and errors and requests ... a merciful punishment."&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, ''Afro-Latino Voices'' p 193.&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals to Christianity and profession of faith allowed Paula to return to her previous life as a slave with minimal punishment. The Spanish Crown placed a high importance on the preservation of Christianity in Latin America, this preservation of Christianity allowed [[colonialism]] to rule Latin America for over three hundred years.

==Nineteenth-century revolutions: the postcolonial era==
{{See also|Latin American wars of independence}}
[[File:Latin American independence countries.PNG|thumb|220px|Countries in Latin America by date of independence]]
Following the model of the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions, most of Latin America achieved its independence by 1825. Independence destroyed the old [[single market|common market]] that existed under the Spanish Empire after the [[Bourbon Reforms]] and created an increased dependence on the financial investment provided by nations which had already begun to [[Industrial Revolution|industrialize]]; therefore, Western European powers, in particular Great Britain and France, and the United States began to play major roles, since the region became economically dependent on these nations. Independence also created a new, self-consciously "Latin American" ruling class and intelligentsia which at times avoided Spanish and Portuguese models in their quest to reshape their societies. This [[elite]] looked towards other [[Catholic]] European models—in particular France—for a new Latin American culture, but did not seek input from indigenous peoples.

The failed efforts in [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] to keep together most of the initial large states that emerged from independence— [[Gran Colombia]], the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]&lt;ref name="FRCA_details"&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/historyofcentralamerica/a/09republicofCA.htm|title = The Federal Republic of Central America (1823-1840)|publisher = [[About.com]]| accessdate = 2009-05-01 | last=Christopher Minster |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Provinces of South America]]—resulted a number of domestic and interstate conflicts, which plagued the new countries. Brazil, in contrast to its Hispanic neighbors, remained a united monarchy and avoided the problem of civil and interstate wars. Domestic wars were often fights between [[federalists]] and centrists who ended up asserted themselves through the military repression of their opponents at the expense of civilian political life. The new nations inherited the cultural diversity of the colonial era and strived to create a new identity based around the shared European (Spanish or Portuguese) language and culture. Within each country, however, there were cultural and class divisions that created tension and hurt national unity.

[[File:Latin America Major International Boundary Disputes.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Map of [[List of territorial disputes|disputed territories]] in Latin America]]
For the next few decades there was a long process to create a sense of [[Nationalism|nationality]]. Most of the new national borders were created around the often centuries-old [[Audiencia Real|audiencia]] jurisdictions or the Bourbon [[Intendant|intendancies]], which had become areas of political identity. In many areas the borders were unstable, since the new states fought wars with each other to gain access to resources, especially in the second half of the nineteenth century. The more important conflicts were the [[Paraguayan War]] (1864–70; also known as the War of the Triple Alliance) and the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–84). The Paraguayan War pitted Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay against Paraguay, which was utterly defeated. As a result, Paraguay suffered a [[demographic collapse]]: the population went from an estimated 525,000 persons in 1864 to 221,000 in 1871 and out of this last population, only around 28,000 were men.  In the War of the Pacific, Chile defeated the combined forces of Bolivia and Peru. Chile gained control of [[Sodium nitrate|saltpeter]]-rich areas, previously controlled by Peru and Bolivia, and Bolivia became a land-locked nation. By mid-century the region also confronted a growing United States, seeking to expand on the North American continent and extend its influence in the hemisphere. In [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–48), Mexico lost over half of its territory to the United States. In the 1860s France attempted to [[French intervention in Mexico|indirectly control Mexico]]. In South America, Brazil consolidated its control of large swaths of the [[Amazon Basin]] at the expense of its neighbors. In the 1880s the United States implemented an aggressive policy to defend and expand its political and economic interests in all of Latin America, which culminated in the creation of the [[Pan-American Conference]], the [[History of the Panama Canal|successful completion of the Panama Canal]] and the [[Spanish–American War|United States intervention in the final Cuban war of independence]].

The [[Primary sector of the economy|export of natural resources]] provided the basis of most Latin American economies in the nineteenth century, which allowed for the development of wealthy elite. The restructuring of colonial economic and political realities resulted in a sizable gap between rich and poor, with landed elites controlling the vast majority of land and resources. In [[Brazil]], for instance, by 1910 85% of the land belonged to 1% of the population. Gold mining and fruit growing, in particular, were monopolized by these wealthy landowners. These "Great Owners" completely controlled local activity and, furthermore, were the principal employers and the main source of wages. This led to a society of [[peasant]]s whose connection to larger political realities remained in thrall to farming and mining magnates.

The [[endemic]] political instability and the nature of the economy resulted in the emergence of [[caudillos]], military chiefs whose hold on power depended on their military skill and ability to dispense [[patronage]]. The political regimes were at least in theory [[Democracy|democratic]] and took the form of either [[Presidential system|presidential]] or [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] governments. Both were prone to being taken over by a caudillo or an [[oligarchy]]. The political landscape was occupied by [[Conservatism|conservatives]], who believed that the preservation of the old social hierarchies served as the best guarantee of national stability and prosperity, and [[Liberalism|liberals]], who sought to bring about progress by freeing up the economy and individual initiative. Popular [[insurrections]] were often influential and repressed: 100,000 were killed during the suppression of a Colombian revolt between 1899 and 1902 during the [[Thousand Days' War]]. Some states did manage to have some of democracy: [[Uruguay]], and partially [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Colombia]]. The others were clearly oligarchist or [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], although these oligarchs and caudillos sometimes enjoyed support from a majority in the population. All of these regimes sought to maintain Latin America's lucrative position in the world economy as a provider of raw materials.

==20th century==

===1900–1929===
[[File:Go Away Little Man Charles Green Bush.jpg|thumb|190px|1903 political cartoon: President Roosevelt intimidating [[Colombia]] to acquire the [[Panama Canal Zone]].]]
By the start of the century, the United States continued its interventionist attitude, which aimed to directly defend its interests in the region. This was officially articulated in [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Big Stick ideology|Big Stick Doctrine]], which modified the old [[Monroe Doctrine]], which had simply aimed to deter European intervention in the hemisphere. At the conclusion of the [[Spanish–American War]] the new government of Cuba and the United States signed the [[Platt Amendment]] in 1902, which authorized the United States to intervene in Cuban affairs when the United States deemed necessary. In [[Colombia]], United States sought the [[Concession (territory)|concession]] of a [[Panama Canal Zone|territory in Panama]] to build a much anticipated canal across the isthmus. The Colombian government opposed this, but a Panamanian insurrection provided the United States with an opportunity. The United States backed Panamanian independence and the new nation granted the concession. These were not the only interventions carried out in the region by the United States. In the first decades of the twentieth century, there were several military incursions into Central America and the Caribbean, mostly in defense of commercial interests, which became known as the "[[Banana Wars]]."

The greatest political upheaval in the second decade of the century took place in Mexico. In 1908, President [[Porfirio Díaz]], who had been in office since 1884, promised that he would step down in 1910. [[Francisco I. Madero]], a moderate liberal whose aim was to modernize the country while preventing a [[Socialism#Revolutions of 1917–1923|socialist revolution]], launched an election campaign in 1910. Díaz, however, changed his mind and ran for office once more. Madero was arrested on election day and Díaz declared the winner. These events provoked uprisings, which became the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Revolutionary movements were organized and some key leaders appeared: [[Pancho Villa]] in the north, [[Emiliano Zapata]] in the south, and Madero in Mexico City. Madero's forces defeated the federal army in early 1911, assumed temporary control of the government and won a second election later on November 6, 1911. Madero undertook moderate reforms to implement greater democracy in the political system but failed to satisfy many of the regional leaders in what had become a revolutionary situation. Madero's failure to address [[agrarianism|agrarian]] claims led Zapata to break with Madero and resume the revolution. On February 18, 1913 [[Victoriano Huerta]], a conservative general organized  a [[coup d'état]] with the support of the United States; Madero was killed four days later. Other revolutionary leaders such as Villa, Zapata, and [[Venustiano Carranza]] continued to militarily oppose the federal government, now under Huerta's control. Allies Zapata and Villa took Mexico City in March 1914, but found themselves outside of their elements in the capital and withdrew to their respective bastions. This allowed Carranza to assume control of the central government. He then organized the repression of the rebel armies of Villa and Zapata, led in particular by General [[Álvaro Obregón]]. The [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution of 1917]], still the current constitution, was proclaimed but initially little enforced. The efforts against the other revolutionary leaders continued. Zapata was assassinated on April 10, 1919. Carranza himself was assassinated on May 15, 1920, leaving Obregón in power, who was officially elected president later that year. Finally in 1923 Villa was also assassinated. With the removal of the main rivals Obregón is able to consolidate power and relative peace returned to Mexico. Under the Constitution a liberal government is implemented but some of the aspirations of the working and rural classes remained unfulfilled. (See also, [[Agrarian land reform in Mexico]].)
====Sports====
Sports became increasingly popular, drawing enthusiastic fans to large stadia.&lt;ref&gt;David M.K. Sheinin, ed., ''Sports Culture in Latin American History'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The International Olympic Committee (IOC) worked to encourage Olympic ideals and participation.  Following the 1922 Latin American Games in Rio de Janeiro, the IOC helped to establish national Olympic committees and prepare for future competition. In Brazil, however, sporting and political rivalries slowed progress as opposing factions fought to control of international sport. The [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in Paris and the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] games in Amsterdam saw greatly increased participation from Latin American athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Cesar R. Torres, "The Latin American 'Olympic Explosion’ of the 1920s: causes and consequences." ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 23.7 (2006): 1088-1111.&lt;/ref&gt;   English and Scottish engineers brought futebol (soccer) to Brazil in the late 1800s. The International Committee of the YMCA of North America and the Playground Association of America played major roles in training coaches. .&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Guedes, "‘Changing the cultural landscape’: English engineers, American missionaries, and the YMCA bring sports to Brazil–the 1870s to the 1930s."

===1930–1960===
{{See also|Latin America during World War II}}
[[File:Guatearbenz0870.JPG|thumb|upright|A mural celebrating [[Jacobo Árbenz|Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán]] and the [[Guatemalan Revolution]]]]
The [[Great Depression]] posed a great challenge to the region. The collapse of the world economy meant that the demand for raw materials drastically declined, undermining many of the economies of Latin America. Intellectuals and government leaders in Latin America turned their backs on the older economic policies and turned toward [[import substitution industrialization]]. The goal was to create self-sufficient economies, which would have their own industrial sectors and large middle classes and which would be immune to the ups and downs of the global economy. Despite the potential threats to United States commercial interests, the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] (1933–1945) understood that the United States could not wholly oppose import substitution. Roosevelt implemented a [[Good Neighbor policy]] and allowed the nationalization of some American companies in Latin America. Mexican President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] nationalized American [[Petroleum industry|oil companies]], out of which he created [[Pemex]]. Cárdenas also oversaw the redistribution of a quantity of land, fulfilling the hopes of many since the start of the Mexican Revolution. The Platt Amendment was also repealed, freeing Cuba from legal and official interference of the United States in its politics. The [[World War II|Second World War]] also brought the United States and most Latin American nations together.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Bulmer-Thomas, ''The Economic History of Latin America since Independence'' (2nd ed. 2003) pp 189-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the postwar period, the expansion of [[communism]] became the greatest political issue for both the United States and governments in the region. The start of the [[Cold War]] forced governments to choose between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].  Following the 1948 [[Costa Rica Civil War]], the nation established a new constitution and was recognized as the first legitimate democracy in Latin America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~kellogg/publications/workingpapers/WPS/354.pdf|title= Regime legacies and democratization: explaining variance in the level of democracy in Latin America, 1978-2004.|publisher=Kellogg Institute|date=December 2008|last=Mainwaring|first=Scott|last2=Pérez-Liñán|first2=Aníbal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the new Costa Rican government, which now was constitutionally required to ban the presence of a standing military, did not seek regional influence and was distracted further by conflicts with neighboring Nicaragua.

Several [[Socialism|socialist]] and communist insurgencies broke out in Latin America throughout the entire twentieth century, but the most successful one was in Cuba. The [[Cuban Revolution]] was led by [[Fidel Castro]] against the regime of [[Fulgencio Batista]], who since 1933 was the principal autocrat in Cuba. Since the 1860s the Cuban economy had focused on the cultivation of sugar, of which 82% was sold in the American market by the twentieth century. Despite the repeal of the Platt Amendment, the United States still had considerable influence in Cuba, both in politics and in everyday life. In fact Cuba had a reputation of being the "brothel of the United States," a place where Americans could find all sorts of licit and illicit pleasures, provided they had the cash. Despite having the [[Constitution of Cuba|socially advanced constitution of 1940]], Cuba was plagued with corruption and the interruption of constitutional rule by autocrats like Batista. Batista began his final turn as the head of the government in a 1952 coup. The coalition that formed under the revolutionaries hoped to restore the constitution, reestablish a democratic state and free Cuba from the American influence. The revolutionaries succeeded in toppling Batista on January 1, 1959. Castro, who initially declared himself as a non-socialist, initiated a program of agrarian reforms and nationalizations in May 1959, which alienated the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] (1953–61) and resulted in the United States breaking of diplomatic relations, freezing Cuban assets in the United States and placing an embargo on the nation in 1960. The [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] (1961–1963) authorized the funding and support of an [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|invasion of Cuba]] by exiles. The invasion failed and radicalized the revolutionary government's position. Cuba officially proclaimed itself socialist and openly became an ally of the [[Soviet Union]]. The military collaboration between Cuba and the Soviet Union, which included the placement of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s in Cuba precipitated the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of October 1962.

===Late-20th-century military regimes and revolutions===
[[File:Jorge Rafael Videla.png|thumb|The [[National Reorganization Process|military junta of Argentina]] saw widespread [[Dirty War|repression]] against those it deemed to be political dissidents]]
By the 1970s, leftists had acquired a significant political influence which prompted the right-wing, ecclesiastical authorities and a large portion of each individual country's upper class to support coups d'état to avoid what they perceived as a communist threat. This was further fueled by Cuban and United States intervention which led to a political polarization. Most South American countries were in some periods ruled by [[military dictatorship]]s that were supported by the United States of America.

Around the 1970s, the regimes of the [[Southern Cone]] collaborated in [[Operation Condor]] killing many [[leftist]] dissidents, including some [[urban guerrilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.el-universal.com.mx/editoriales/34023.html | author = Victor Flores Olea | title = Editoriales&amp;nbsp;– El Universal&amp;nbsp;– 10 de abril 2006 : Operacion Condor | publisher = [[El Universal (Mexico)]] | accessdate = 2009-03-24 | language = Spanish | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628021303/http://www.el-universal.com.mx/editoriales/34023.html | archive-date = 2007-06-28 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington Consensus===
{{Main article|Washington Consensus}}
The set of  specific economic policy prescriptions that were considered the "standard" reform package were promoted for crisis-wracked developing countries by Washington, DC-based institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], and the [[US Treasury Department]] during the 1980s and '90s.

In recent years, several Latin American countries led by socialist or other left wing governments—including Argentina and Venezuela—have campaigned for (and to some degree adopted) policies contrary to the Washington Consensus set of policies. (Other Latin counties with governments of the left, including Brazil, Chile and Peru, have in practice adopted the bulk of the policies). Also critical of the policies as actually promoted by the International Monetary Fund have been some US economists, such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Dani Rodrik]], who have challenged what are sometimes described as the "fundamentalist" policies of the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury for what Stiglitz calls a "one size fits all" treatment of individual economies.
The term has become associated with neoliberal policies in general and drawn into the broader debate over the expanding role of the free market, constraints upon the state, and US influence on other countries' national sovereignty.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Since the 2000s, or 1990s in some countries, left-wing political parties have risen to power. [[Hugo Chávez]] in Venezuela, [[Lula da Silva]] and [[Dilma Rousseff]] in Brazil, [[Fernando Lugo]] in Paraguay, [[Néstor Kirchner|Néstor]] and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|Cristina Kirchner]] in Argentina, [[Tabaré Vázquez]] and [[José Mujica]] in Uruguay, the [[Ricardo Lagos|Lagos]] and [[Michelle Bachelet|Bachelet]] governments in Chile, [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua, [[Manuel Zelaya]] in Honduras (although deposed by the [[2009 Honduran coup d'état|28 June 2009 ''coup d'état'']]), and [[Rafael Correa]] of Ecuador are all part of this wave of left-wing politicians who also often declare themselves [[Socialism|socialists]], Latin Americanists or [[Anti-Imperialism|anti-imperialists]].

{{see also|Conservative wave}}
[[File:Foro sao paulo members.svg|thumb|right|165px|In blue countries under right-wing governments as of 2017]]
The '''conservative wave''' ({{lang-pt|onda conservadora}}) is a political phenomenon that emerged in mid-2010 in South America. In Brazil, it began roughly around the time [[Dilma Rousseff]], in a tight election, won the [[Brazilian general election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], kicking off the fourth term of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] in the highest position of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{citar periódico|ultimo=Boulos|primeiro=Guilherme|data=|titulo=Onda Conservadora|jornal=|doi=|url=https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:fhDXDYBqEFcJ:scholar.google.com/+onda+conservadora&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;lr=lang_pt&amp;as_sdt=0,5|acessadoem=11 de outubro de 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to the political analyst of the Inter-Union Department of Parliamentary Advice, Antônio Augusto de Queiroz, the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] [[Brazilian general election, 2014|elected in 2014]] may be considered the most conservative since the "re-democratization" movement, noting an increase in the number of parliamentarians linked to more conservative segments, as [[Ruralism|ruralists]], [[Military of Brazil|military]], [[Police of Brazil|police]] and [[Religious Right|religious]].

The subsequent economic crisis of 2015 and investigations of corruption scandals led to a right-wing movement that sought to rescue ideas from [[economic liberalism]] and [[conservatism]] in [[Political opposition|opposition]] to [[Left-wing politics|left-wing policies]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15864">'''Hypermasculinity''' is a [[psychological]] term for the [[exaggeration]] of [[male]] [[stereotype|stereotypical]] [[behavior]], such as an emphasis on [[physical strength]], [[aggression]], and [[human male sexuality|sexuality]]. This term has been used pejoratively by some scholars.

==Studies==

One of the first studies of hypermasculinity was conducted by Donald L. Mosher and Mark Sirkin in 1984. Mosher and Sirkin have operationally defined hypermasculinity or the "[[macho]] personality" as consisting of three variables:
*callous sexual attitudes toward women
*the belief that violence is manly
*the experience of danger as exciting
They developed the ''Hypermasculinity Inventory'' (HMI) designed to measure the three components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mosher | first1 = Donald L. | last2 = Serkin | first2 = Mark | year = 1984 | title = Measuring a macho personality constellation | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 150–163 | doi = 10.1016/0092-6566(84)90026-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has found that hypermasculinity is associated with sexual and [[physical aggression towards women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mosher | first1 = Donald L. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = Ronald D. | year = 1986 | title = Macho personality, sexual aggression, and reactions to guided imagery of realistic rape | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 77–94 | doi = 10.1016/0092-6566(86)90111-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parrott | first1 = Dominic J. | last2 = Zeichner | first2 = Amos | year = 2003 | title = Effects of hypermasculinity oh physical aggression against women | url = | journal = Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 70–78 | doi = 10.1037/1524-9220.4.1.70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners have higher hypermasculinity scores than control groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beesley | first1 = Francis | last2 = McGuire | first2 = James | year = 2009 | title = Gender-role identity and hypermasculinity in violent offending | url = | journal = Psychology, Crime &amp; Law | volume = 15 | issue = 2–3| pages = 251–268 | doi = 10.1080/10683160802190988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fetal development==
{{see also|Sex differences in psychology}}

Finger length (specifically the lengths of the ring and index fingers), have been correlated with high and low levels of fetal androgens. These [[digit ratio]]s (2D:4D) have been prevalent in more recent research on this topic. 2D:4D relationships have been correlated with different amounts of prenatal testosterone, and it is generally believed that having a shorter index (or 2nd digit) than the ring finger (or 4th digit), corresponds with having higher levels of prenatal androgens. Relatively masculine ratios have been associated with male heterosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rahman | first1 = Q. | last2 = Wilson | first2 = G.

Although these findings have been more significant in males, many studies feel that more research on the effects of these hormone levels in women will be useful in fully understanding this phenomenon. Differing levels of prenatal androgens have been found to modulate moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Montoya | first1 = E. R. | last2 = Terburg | first2 = D. | last3 = Bos | first3 = P. A. | last4 = Will | first4 = G. J. | last5 = Buskens | first5 = V. | last6 = Raub | first6 = W. | last7 = van Honk | first7 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Testosterone administration modulates moral judgments depending on second-to-fourth digit ratio | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453012004131 | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume =  38| issue = | pages = 1362–1369| doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.12.001 | pmid=23290991}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, women who were administered exogenous testosterone showed increased preference for utilitarian over deontological judgments. This effect was inverted, however, in women whose finger length ratios were consistent with high prenatal testosterone exposure. Samples of feminist activists in Sweden and Austria showed relatively masculine digit ratios compared to the average for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01011/full|journal=frontiers in Psychology|title=Feminist activist women are masculinized in terms of digit-ratio and social dominance: a possible explanation for the feminist paradox|last=Madison|first=Guy|last2=Ulrika|first2=Aasa|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01011|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotion==

While popular identification of hypermasculine traits tends to revolve around the outward physical aspects of violence, danger and sexual aggression, much less consideration is given to the emotive characteristics that define those men deemed "hypermasculine". Hypermasculine attitudes can also include emotional self-control as a sign of toughness.&lt;ref name = "Dennehy"&gt;Dennehy, T.; Ben-Zeev, Avi et al. (2012). "Hypermasculinity In The Media: When Men 'Walk Into The Fog' To Avoid Affective Communication". "Psychology of Popular Media Culture" '"1"' (1):53–61. {{DOI: 10.1037/a002709}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be emotionally hardened or indifferent, especially toward women, is to display what Thomas Scheff calls "character" – composure and impassiveness in times of great stress or emotion.&lt;ref name = "Scheff"&gt;Scheff, Thomas. (2006). "Hypermasculinity and Violence as a Social System". "2" (2):1–10. {{ISSN: 1558-8769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this hypermasculine stoicism, Scheff observes, "it is masculine men that have 'character'. A man with character who is under stress is not going to cry and blubber like a woman or child might."

Self-imposed emotional monitoring by men has also greatly affected the conditions in which they communicate with women.&lt;ref name="Dennehy"/&gt; Ben-Zeev, Scharnetzki, Chan and Dennehy (2012) write of a recent study that has shown many men to deliberately avoid behaviours and attitudes such as compassion and emotional expression, deeming these traits feminine and thus rejecting them altogether. Scheff adds, "The hypermasculine pattern leads to competition, rather than connection between persons."&lt;ref name = "Scheff"/&gt; In the context of intimate or emotional communication (especially confrontation) with women, the masculine male often withdraws emotionally, refusing to engage in what is termed affective communication (Scheff). In a similar study of affective communication behaviours, gender contrast – the deliberate or subconscious negation by one sex of the behaviours of the other – was far more evident within the young boys used as test subjects than of the girls.

Where this insistence on emotional indifference manifests in the physical definitions of hyper masculinity is discussed by Scheff: "Repressing love and the vulnerable emotions (grief, fear and shame, the latter as in feelings of rejection or disconnection) leads to either silence or withdrawal, on the one hand, or acting out anger (flagrant hostility), on the other. The composure and poise of hypermasculinity seems to be a recipe for silence and violence."&lt;ref name = "Scheff"/&gt;

==In visual media==

Ben-Zeev, Scharnetzki, Chang and Dennehy point toward images in the media as the most important factor influencing hypermasculine behaviour, stating "After all, media does not only reflect cultural norms but can and does transform social reality".&lt;ref name="Dennehy"/&gt; This is based on the fact that physical and emotional elements of hypermasculine behaviour are manifested regularly in advertising, Hollywood film, and even in video games through the use of very strong imagery: muscular men overpowering women in advertisements, actors portraying staunch male characters who do not give in to the emotional appeals of their female counterparts and countless video games whose story lines are based strictly on violence. The constant availability of these images for every-day public viewing and use has indeed paved the way for the construction of a system of re-enactment (consciously or unconsciously) by both men and women, of the values they perpetuate (Ben-Zeev et al.).&lt;ref name="Dennehy"/&gt;

Brian Krans describes the results of a study in which advertisements in men's magazines were analyzed for hypermasculine appeal: "The team found that at least one hypermasculinity variable appeared in 56 percent of the 527 advertisements they identified. Some magazines' advertisements included hypermasculine messages a whopping 90 percent of the time."&lt;ref name = "Krans"&gt;Krans, Brian. (2013). "[http://www.healthline.com/health-news/mental-masculine-ads-distort-mens-perceptions-030313 Hypermasculinity in Advertising: Selling Manly Men to Regular Men]". "Healthline News".&lt;/ref&gt; Krans reports that the researchers were concerned that such ads, which are generally aimed at young male audiences, are playing a very prominent role in shaping the still-developing attitudes toward gender of these young men.

In the gaming industry, hypermasculinity is experienced mainly through the fantastic and often violent situations presented in the gameplay, and as well by the typical design and character traits of the playable characters: often powerfully built, bold and full of bravado and usually armed. "The choice of female characters and actions within games leaves women with few realistic, non-sexualized options", while female characters, like Lara Croft, are but illusions of female empowerment, and instead serve only to satisfy the gaze of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salter | first1 = Anastasia | last2 = Blodgett | first2 = Bridget | year = 2012 | title = Hypermasculinity &amp; Dickwolves: The Contentious Role of Women in the New Gaming Public | url = | journal = Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 401–416 | doi = 10.1080/08838151.2012.705199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypermasculine styles in gay male culture are prominent in gay [[disco]] groups of the 1970s such as [[Village People]], and are reflected in the [[BDSM]] gay [[subculture]] depicted in the film [[Cruising (film)|''Cruising'']] (1980). The term "hypermasculine" also characterizes a style of [[erotic art]] in which male figure's muscles and penis/testicles are portrayed as being unrealistically large and prominent. Gay artists who exploit hypermasculine types include [[Tom of Finland]] and [[Gengoroh Tagame]].

==Effect on women==

The media's influence in creating gendered behaviours operates strongly upon women. In the same way that male consumers seek to conform to the physical and emotional characteristics predicated by stereotypes in visual media, so too do women tend to fall into the trap of conforming to the imagined social norms.&lt;ref name = "Krans"/&gt; Only, the media encourages them to fulfill the roles of the submissive and subservient women depicted in advertisements and commercials; in other words, the system pressures women to assume their roles as the focal points of the violence and sexual callousness of men. "Advertisements depicting men as violent (particularly towards women) is disturbing, because gender portrayals in advertisements do more than sell products. They also perpetuate stereotypes and present behavioural norms for men and women."&lt;ref name = "Scheff"/&gt;

In his 2002 book ''Soul Babies: Black Popular Culture and the Post-Soul Aesthetic'', [[Mark Anthony Neal]] states that black masculinity became synonymous with a unified black identity during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Neal claims that the hypermasculinity translated as violence within the black community to protect from violence directed at the black community from white America. Black gays and women were sometimes censured outright in an effort to merge black identity with masculinity. [[Huey P. Newton]], in an effort to improve ties, wrote an essay to advocate for a stronger alliance between black political organizations and the women and gay members of their community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workers.org/2012/us/huey_p_newton_0524/ Huey P. Newton on Gay and Women's Liberation], 15 August 1970, reprinted in ''Worker's World'' (accessed 7 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he admitted that this popularity of hypermasculinity drives a tendency towards violence and silencing of women and gay men, which didn't permit these marginalized members to become a part of the black identity.

'''''idem.''''' is a [[Latin]] term meaning "the same".  It is commonly [[abbreviation|abbreviated]] as '''''id.''''',
which is particularly used in legal citations to denote the previously cited source (compare ''[[ibid.]]''). It is also used in academic citations to replace the name of a repeated author. 

''Id.'' is employed extensively in [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Law of Canada|legislation]] and in [[United states legislative branch|legal documents of the United States]] to apply a short description to a section with the same focus as the previous.&lt;ref name="trump"&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. 9th circuit appeals court|title=9th circuit appeals court - opinion of judges (9 Feb 2017) - State of Washington v. Donald J.Trump|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf|website=www.cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Id'' is masculine and neuter;  '''''ead.''''' (feminine), is the abbreviation for '''''eadem''''', which also translates to "the same". 

As an abbreviation, ''Id.'' always takes a period (or full stop) in both British and American usage (see [[Full stop#Abbreviations and personal titles of address|usage of the full stop in abbreviations]]). Its first known use dates back to the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of ''Idem'' |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idem |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wiktionary}}

==Use==
===Legal===
*''United States v. Martinez-Fuerte'', 428 U.S. 543, 545 (1976).
*''Id.'' at 547.

Here, the first citation refers to the case of ''United States v. Martinez-Fuerte.'' The volume number cited is 428 and the page on which the case begins is 543, and the page number cited to is 545.  The "U.S." between the numerical portions of the citation refers to the ''[[United States Reports]]''. 1976 refers to the year that the case was published.  The second citation references the first citation and automatically incorporates the same reporter and volume number; however, the page number cited is now 547. ''Id.'' refers to the immediately preceding citation, so if the previous citation includes more than one reference, or it is unclear which reference ''Id.'' refers to, its usage is inappropriate.

* ''"...the Executive Order declares that “the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles.” Id. It asserts, “Deteriorating..."'' (from page 2 of [http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf State of Washington v. Donald J. Trump])

Here, Id. refers to the Executive Order that was mentioned in the previous sentence.&lt;ref name="trump" /&gt;

*''Id.'' ''Astral Labyrinth: Archaeology of the Greek Sky''. Sutton Pub, 2003.

In this example, ''Id'' in the second citation indicates that the author is identical to that of the previous citation. That is, the author of the second citation is also Macgillivray, J. A.

[[File:4778 - Venezia - Palazzo ducale - Capitello 12 - Iniusticia seva sum - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 31-Jul-2008.jpg|thumb|'''Injustice''', one in a series of [[allegory|allegorical]] [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] depicting vices and virtues at the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Ducal Palace in Venice]]]]

'''Injustice''' is a quality relating to unfairness or undeserved outcomes. The term may be applied in reference to a particular event or situation, or to a larger [[status quo]]. In [[Western philosophy]] and [[jurisprudence]], injustice is very commonly—but not always—defined as  either the absence or the opposite of [[justice]].&lt;ref&gt;McCoubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. Textbook on Jurisprudence. Second Edition. [[Blackstone Press Limited]]. 1996. {{ISBN|1-85431-582-X}}. Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Simon" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heinze" /&gt;

The sense of injustice is a universal human feature, though the exact circumstances considered unjust can vary from culture to culture. While even acts of nature can sometimes arouse the sense of injustice, the sense is usually felt in relation to human action such as misuse, [[abuse]], neglect, or malfeasance that is uncorrected or else sanctioned by a [[legal system]] or fellow human beings.

The sense of injustice can be a powerful motivational condition, causing people to take action not just to defend themselves but also others who they perceive to be unfairly treated.

==Relationship with justice==
Professor [[Judith N. Shklar|Judith Shklar]] has written that Western philosophers tend to spend much more time discussing the concept of 'justice' rather than 'injustice'. On the other hand, she states both historical writing and fiction use instances of injustice as subject matter far more often than justice.&lt;ref name = "Judith" /&gt;

In philosophy and jurisprudence, the dominant view has been that injustice and justice are two sides of the same coin—that injustice is simply a lack of justice.  This view has been challenged by professors including Judith Shklar, Thomas W Simon and [[Eric Heinze]], who consider that justice and injustice are independent qualities. So, in this minority view, you can increase the justice of a situation without reducing the injustice. Heinze has even gone as far as to argue that an increase in justice can actually cause an increase in injustice.&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Heinze"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;

A relatively common view among philosophers and other writers is that while justice and injustice may be interdependent, it is injustice that is the primary quality. Many writers have written that, while it is hard to directly define or even perceive justice, it is easy to demonstrate that injustice can be perceived by all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| volume = 55| issue = 2
| pages = 336–364| year = 1946| jstor = 792700
| doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to [[Friedrich Hayek|von Hayek]], the earliest known thinker to state that injustice is the primary quality was [[Heraclitus]],  whose view was echoed by [[Aristotle]] and dozens of others down the centuries. Hayek said that writers often express the idea that injustice is the primary concept "as though it were a new discovery", suggesting the view is rarely directly expressed in theories on Justice. But Hayek went on to say that [[legal positivism]] has proved that injustice, not justice, is the primary quality.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 8 "THE QUEST FOR JUSTICE"  in Vol 2 of  von Hayeks's ''The mirage of social justice'' (University of Chicago Press,  1978). For a list discussing dozens of writers who have stated down the centuries that  injustice, not justice, is the primary concept, look out for the long footnote under the sub heading  "Rules of just conduct are generally prohibitions of unjust conduct"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sense of injustice==
[[File:Flickr - Yale Law Library - Beast of Injustice.jpg|thumb|right|A metaphorical injustice eating the innocent in [[Guillaume Rouillé]]'s ''Justicie atque Iniusticie''.  The legs of the beast include ''adolescés sine obediétia'' (disobedient youth) and ''plebs sine disciplina''(undisciplined commoners).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://library.law.yale.edu/blogs/rare-books/2010-07 |author=Mike Widener |title=More images in our Flickr galleries|publisher=Yale Law Library |date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Scholars including Judith Shklar, Edmond Cahn  and [[Barrington Moore, Jr.]] have surveyed anthropological and historical work on injustice, concluding that the sense of injustice is found everywhere there are men and women; it is a [[human universal]].&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Moore" /&gt;    
These writers, and others like [[Simone Weil]], Elizabeth Wolgast and Thomas W Simon, hold that the sense of injustice is a powerful motivational condition — unlike the sense of justice which tends to be conceived in more abstract ways, and tends to inspire contemplation rather than action.&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Bell" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wolgast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Clive. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Priority_of_Injustice.html?id=_2jmAQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Priority of Injustice: Locating Democracy in Critical Theory'']. (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2017). {{ISBN| 978-0820351520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cahn held that, for [[evolution|evolutionary reasons]], humans who witness others being subjected to injustice can respond as though it was an act of aggression towards themselves. There can be an immediate, visceral activation of the [[fight-or-flight response|flight or fight]] system. As [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] puts it "injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr., [[Letter from a Birmingham Jail]] (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study published in [[Psychological Science]] found that even babies have a sense of injustice and dislike having it violated, even when they witness events that do not directly effect them.&lt;ref&gt;

In the field of jurisprudence, Cahn has argued that it is an important skill for lawyers to know how to rouse a jury's sense of injustice — something best done by appeals to the particular, not by abstractions or [[Boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] type statements.  Barrington Moore asserts that reasons why populations often submit to [[oppression]] for long periods of time is that they consider it inevitable and so their sense of injustice is not aroused. He says that a widely shared sense of injustice is an essential, though not sufficient, cause of rebellion.  Writers including Simone Weil, Elizabeth Wolgast and Judith Shklar have said that an aroused sense of injustice can be an essential prerequisite to action needed for protecting the weak and afflicted.&lt;ref name = "Judith"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Moore"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Bell"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wolgast"/&gt;

==Causes==
A common cause of injustice is human selfishness. As [[Plato]] described at length in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', people will often commit acts of injustice when they calculate it is in their interests to do so.&lt;ref name = "Heinze"/&gt;  Plato also adds that "The highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not".   Human injustice is not always caused by attempt to gain unfair advantage or malice; it may be simply the result of the flawed human [[decision making]]. For example, studies have found that judges sitting on review boards are less likely to reach decisions favorable to applicants depending on how long it is since the judges had their last food break.&lt;ref&gt;"We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65% after a break." {{cite journal |author1=Shai Danzigera |author2=Jonathan Levav |author3=Liora Avnaim-Pessoa| title=Extraneous factors in judicial decisions |date=11 April 2011 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=108 |issue=17 |pages=6889–92 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1018033108 |pmid=21482790 | accessdate=15 November 2011|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.6889D |pmc=3084045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more on the substantial difference in judges' decisions depending on time since last food break, see chpt 3 of [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Misuse and abuse with regard to a particular case or context may represent a systemic failure to serve the cause of justice (cf. [[Non liquet|legal vacuum]]).&lt;ref name = "Simon"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cahn"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27812">The '''1994 K Foundation award''' was an award given by the [[K Foundation]] ([[Bill Drummond]] and [[Jimmy Cauty]]) to the "worst artist of the year". The shortlist for the £40,000 K Foundation award was identical to the shortlist for the well-established but controversial £20,000 [[Turner Prize]] for the best British [[contemporary art]]ist. On the evening of 23 November 1993, [[Rachel Whiteread]] was presented with the 1993 [[Turner Prize]] inside London's [[Tate Gallery]], and the 1994 K Foundation award on the street outside.

Prior to presenting their award, the K Foundation held a private exhibit of a collection of art works entitled ''Money - A Major Body of Cash''. The award, the exhibition and the accompanying extravagant press junket were widely reported by the media.

==Context==
In June 1993 the newly formed K Foundation began taking out full page national press adverts. Initial advertisements were cryptic, referring to "K Time" and advising readers to "Kick out the clocks".&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("Divide &amp; Kreate"), ''[[The Guardian|Guardian Weekend]]'', 3 July 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=330 link]) and ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 3 July 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=329 link])&lt;/ref&gt; They mentioned five-year journeys which included pop success and deep space travel and that "the [[Sands of time (idiom)|sands of time]] are running in".&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("The Sands of Time Are Running In"), ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', 4 July 1993&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an advert for the K Foundation's single "[[K Cera Cera]]" which was "Available nowhere ... no formats" and which was not planned for release until world peace was established.&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("K Cera Cera"), ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 10 July 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=332 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a change of direction with the fourth advert which appeared on 14 August 1993, reading: "ABANDON ALL ART NOW. Major rethink in progress. Await further announcements."&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("Abandon All Art Now"), ''[[The Guardian|Guardian Weekend]]'', 14 August 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=339 link])&lt;/ref&gt; The next ad (28 August 1993) read: "It has come to our attention that you did not abandon all art now. Further direct action is thus necessary. The K Foundation announce the 'mutha of all awards', the 1994 K Foundation award for the worst artist of the year." It then went on to detail how a shortlist of four artists had been chosen, and that they would be exhibited in the [[Tate Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("Serious Direct Action"), ''[[The Guardian|Guardian Weekend]]'', 28 August 1993 and ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 29 August 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first newspaper pieces about the K Foundation appeared in ''[[The Guardian]]'' the following Monday, correctly pointing out that the shortlist and exhibition were actually for the 1993 [[Turner Prize]], the controversial £20,000 annual award given by the UK art establishment to the best young contemporary artist, but assuming that the K Foundation prize was a hoax. "As for the K Foundation", the newspaper wrote, "it stands unmasked as the current performing face of those cherished old friends of pop pranksterdom, Bill Drummond and [[Jimmy Cauty]]",&lt;ref&gt;Ezard, J., "Worst art hoaxers' scam goes kaput", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 30 August 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=342 link])&lt;/ref&gt; formerly known as [[The KLF]]. In September, the organisers of the Turner Prize responded publicly that "It proves the validity of our prize that somebody would take so much trouble to set up this award".&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Musical Express]]'', 11 September 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=346 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation's next advert invited the general public to vote for the worst artist, either by going to the exhibition and using their critical faculties or by letting their inherent prejudices come to the fore.&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("Let The People Choose"), ''[[The Guardian|Guardian Weekend]]'', 18 September 1993 and ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 19 September 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The final advert summarised the whole campaign, asked some questions back to the people that had written to them, and explained that the winner of the K Foundation award would be announced in a TV advert during the live Turner Prize coverage on [[Channel 4]] television.&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("Artist We Love You"), ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'', 7 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=355 link]) and ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 21 November 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 1993, ''[[The Economist]]'' reported on the K Foundation prize and placed it in context. "Every autumn for the past ten years, an increasingly bad-tempered squabble has raged between, on the one hand, many of Britain's art critics and its popular media, and on the other, its avant-garde "establishment," the small croterie of art historians, curators, and dealers who control the Turner prize." Predicting that [[Rachel Whiteread]], creator of the controversial sculpture ''[[House (sculpture)|House]]'', would win both awards, the magazine said that, if it were so, "the vast numbers of people who equate contemporary art with rubbish will, yet again, feel vindicated."&lt;ref&gt;News item, ''[[The Economist]]'', 20 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=357 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

The K Foundation's television adverts on the evening of 23 November 1993 explained that the Foundation were currently "amending the history of art" at a secret location.&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation television advertisements, [[Channel 4]], 23 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=516 link])&lt;/ref&gt; No mention of the alternative award was made in the post-Turner Prize studio discussion. The K Foundation reportedly pre-announced [[Rachel Whiteread]] as their winner at 2pm&lt;ref&gt;"House - Rachel Whiteread", ArtistsInEastLondon.org ([http://www.artistsineastlondon.org/08_house/04text.htm link])&lt;/ref&gt; or, at least, at some time before the Turner;&lt;ref name="DawsonScott"&gt;Dawson Scott, Robert, "K Foundation tries to turn the art world on its head", ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'', 28 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=364 link])&lt;/ref&gt; at 9.30pm, live on television, the Turner Prize was awarded to the same artist. Whiteread reluctantly collected her K Foundation winnings at just past 11pm, saying, "sarcastically, "What an honour.""&lt;ref name="Lister"&gt;Lister, David, "Money to burn in an eccentric cause", ''[[The Independent]]'' (London) ISSN 0951-9467 , Home News Page. Lister was a K Foundation witness. Article misnames Drummond as "Phil Drummond".&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond claimed the advertising campaign cost £250,000.&lt;ref&gt;"Yasser, they can boogie!", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 13 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=356 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; The television advertisements cost £20,000, an amount which ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' said was "carefully chosen to match the value of the Turner prize", the newspaper adding that "Copies of the invoices were supplied as evidence."&lt;ref name="DawsonScott"/&gt; Each press advert cost between £5,000 and £15,000.&lt;ref name="Times-ads"&gt;Sandall, Robert, "Adding to the confusion; K Foundation's new ads", ''[[The Times]]'' (London) ISSN 0140-0460 , 12 September 1993, Features section.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Amending of Art History ==
[[Image:Tate.britain.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|The Tate Gallery, scene of the Turner Prize and K Foundation awards]]
25 witnesses - including art critics, journalists, music industry figures and artists - were invited to participate in the Foundation's "Amending of art history".&lt;ref name="KellyQ"&gt;[[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Kelly, D.]], "Million Dollar Bash", ''[[Q Magazine]]'', February 1994, ''passim'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=377 link]). Kelly was a K Foundation witness.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Face"&gt;"K Foundation: Nailed To The Wall", ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'', January 1994, ''passim'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=374 link]). Written by an unnamed K Foundation witness.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SandallBurning"&gt;Sandall, Robert, "Money to burn", ''[[The Times]]'' (London) ISSN 0140-0460 , 5 November 1995, Features p1. Sandall was also a K Foundation witness.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A timetable of the evening's events, which corroborates the other sources referenced here, was printed in "The wad couple", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 4 December 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=367 link])&lt;/ref&gt; They were driven in a convoy of white limousines, led by a gold limo, to [[Heston Service Station]] where they were handed a press release and £1650 in crisp new £50 notes. The accompanying press release stated that 25 × £1600 collectively made up the £40000 K Foundation prize, and that the extra £50 was for the witness to verify its authenticity by spending it. The witnesses were dressed in fluorescent orange hard hats and safety jackets.

The convoy proceeded to a field patrolled by two orange-painted K Foundation [[Alvis Saracen|Saracen armoured cars]],&lt;ref&gt;Sharkey, A., "Trash Art &amp; Kreation", ''[[The Guardian|The Guardian Weekend]]'', 21 May 1994, ''passim'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=384 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; driven by Drummond and Cauty, broadcasting the K Foundation's [[K Cera Cera]] and [[ABBA]]'s "Money Money Money". Silver-bearded "Mr Ball", the K Foundation's compere, directed the witnesses to nail their wad of money to a board inside a gilt frame, to assemble the K Foundation's prize. Some of the witnesses pocketed all or some of their wad, and the prize money was, according to [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]], some £9000 short. Mr Ball also directed the witnesses to "view the art": One million pounds in £50 notes, nailed to a large framed board. This was the K Foundation's first art work, ''Nailed To A Wall'', "the first of a series of K Foundation art installations that will also include one million pounds in a skip, one million pounds on a table and several variants on the theme of Tremendous Amounts Of Folding".&lt;ref name="KellyQ"/&gt;

Collectively, the K Foundation's money-as-art works were titled ''Money: A Major Body Of Cash'', "seven pieces, all involving various amounts of cash nailed to, tied to or simply standing on inanimate objects".&lt;ref name="Reid"&gt;Reid, J., "Money to burn", ''[[The Observer]]'', 25 September 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=387 link])&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nailed To A Wall'' had a reserve price of £500,000, half the face value of the cash used in its construction, which ''Scotland on Sunday'''s reporter Robert Dawson Scott was "fairly confident... really was £1 million [in cash]". The catalogue entry for the artwork stated: "Over the years the face value will be eroded by inflation, while the artistic value will rise and rise. The precise point at which the artistic value will overtake the face value is unknown. Deconstruct the work now and you double your money. Hang it on a wall and watch the face value erode, the market value fluctuate, and the artistic value soar. The choice is yours."&lt;ref&gt;Dawson Scott, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel Whiteread had already been notified of her "victory" but had refused to accept the prize or allow the K Foundation to use her name.&lt;ref name="Face"/&gt; The motorcade left the site of the amending of art-history and headed back to London, for a showdown with Whiteread on the steps of the Tate. When she again refused to accept the money, the K Foundation explained that it would be [[money burning|burnt]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;"The Best Of Artists, The Worst of Artists", ''[[New York Times]]'', 29 November 1993([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=366 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; With the crowd of now very drunk witnesses looking on, a masked K Foundation operative ([[Alan Goodrick|Gimpo]]) fumbled with matches and lighter fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, W., "Special K", ''[[GQ]]'' magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; At the last moment Rachel Whiteread emerged from the Tate and accepted the money, stating that she would give it as grants to needy artists.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SelectArt"&gt;[[Miranda Sawyer|Sawyer, Miranda]], "But is it Art?", ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', February 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=373 link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--also reported in The Face--&gt;

The next day, the K Foundation's publicist, [[Mick Houghton]], claimed that the voting for the K Foundation's award was supposed to produce a tie, to illustrate the hypocrisy of the Turner award committee, but that strangely the result had been a huge margin of victory for Whiteread. He speculated that the few thousand voters had just liked or rather disliked the sound of her name.

Defending Whiteread, [[Peter Palumbo, Baron Palumbo|Lord Palumbo]] told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that: "Talent at the highest level attracts derision. We must let the artist fail."&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, M. "Terror strikes at the Turner Prize / Art at its very best (or worst)", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=362 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whiteread's sculpture, ''House'', was demolished, as had been planned from its inception, on 11 January 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Alison, "Best and worst of art bites the dust", ''[[The Times]]'' (London) ISSN 0140-0460 , 12 January 1994, Home News section ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=375 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media and art-world reaction==
A huge amount of press publicity ensued, with all the major newspapers and press organisations reporting that Whiteread had won both awards. Media reaction to the K Foundation award was mixed. David Mills wrote in ''[[The Times]]'' that The K Foundation's campaign was "tiresome", and he asked "Doesn't it strike anyone as odd that a group of people who made their money with such artistic endeavours as a disco-version of the Dr Who theme should be suggesting that contemporary art was somehow more fatuous than that?"&lt;ref&gt;Mills, D., "A conspiracy of theorists", ''[[The Times]]'' (London), 28 November 1993, Features section.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel Whiteread had an advertisement printed in the British magazine, ''[[Art Monthly]]'', in which she outlined her plan to donate £10,000 to [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]] and distribute the remainder in grants to 10 needy artists. In the advertisement she stated  that she "does not agree with the K Foundation's aims or methods".&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement ("Rachel Whiteread. The K. Foundation Award"),  ''[[Art Monthly]]'', January 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Displaying perhaps a little humour, Whiteread's advertisement was in a similar style to the K Foundation ads, with stark white text on a black background.

Scottish sculptor [[David Mach]] opined to ''Scotland on Sunday'' that "They're just a bunch of silly buggers. It's good to see money going from a bunch of silly buggers to an artist who is going to make good use of it. What's that saying about a fool and his money...?" [[John Bellany]], on the other hand, said that "The emotional, artistic side of [his] nature... admire[d] the audacity and imagination, challenging art and the art manipulators. The rational side of me asks, is this the most expensive art [[publicity stunt]] this century, and for whom?"&lt;ref name="DawsonScott"/&gt;

Whiteread's agent [[Karsten Schubert]] said, "The whole affair was a non-event. They achieved nothing and they were left looking like real prats."&lt;ref name="Trash"&gt;Sharkey, "Trash Art &amp; Kreation"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--new ref because no "passim"--&gt; Peter Chater, a director of Schubert's agency concurred; he called Drummond and Cauty "cowards". "It was obviously a publicity stunt. What sort of statement they were trying to make I don't know. If it was anything to do with the relationship between art and money it was pretty crass. The KLF made a fortune from a couple of successful singles. Artists aren't in that position. Threatening to set light to £40,000 is pretty obscene." Former [[Factory Records]] boss [[Tony Wilson]] applauded the group, however. "The K Foundation is a very peculiar [[avant garde]] group whose ideas are as valid as anything the Turner people do," he told ''NME''. "Since when has there been laws governing what constitutes art, or an artistic statement? OK, so a lot of people don't understand what Bill and Jimmy are trying to say, but how many people know exactly what Rachel Whiteread's trying to say with her art?"&lt;ref&gt;"The wad couple", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 4 December 1993, ''passim'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=367 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Modern Review (London)|Modern Review]]'' art critic John O'Reilly, another of the K Foundation's witnesses, said: "The whole point of the K Foundation is its anonymity. There's no origin, just a Circulation of data and concepts. There is no master plan, no grand narrative." O'Reilly also "[enjoyed the] sense of waste and sacrifice involved".&lt;ref name="Trash"/&gt;

[[Miranda Sawyer]], who attended the presentation, found special interest in a subsidiary incident during the evening of the prize ceremonies: the theft of money by several of the other invited witnesses: "All the feelings of power and powerlessness that money can bring were fairly summarised with these thefts - it must have turned out better than the K Foundation could have hoped if the examination of cash, art and associated feelings was their point." Sawyer named "[[Britart]]" figure [[Carl Freedman]] as one of those who had taken the money, and reported that "He found the event funny, not offensive (you would too if you walked off with £1,600!), but thought the point had been made before."&lt;ref name="SelectArt"/&gt;&lt;!-- "Questions about the nature and value of art, who controls it and defines it, have been asked continuously since [[Duchamp]]", he said, conceding that the event was "funny and slightly subversive".--&gt;&lt;ref name="Trash"/&gt;

Writer and "underground art historian" [[Stewart Home]] was viciously supportive of the K Foundation. "The [[avant-garde]] wasn't to be seen at the Turner Prize gathering, it was to be found among that select band of individuals who'd organised the K Foundation's attack on the smug complacency of the arts establishment.... 'dignitaries' such as Lord Polumbo were revealed as buffoons. While Polumbo ranted about the dunces who attack cultural innovations, his rhetoric showed him to be a complete idiot — several people immediately pointed out that he was unable to correctly name [[Van Gogh]]'s art dealer brother.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Polumbo claimed that there are no monuments erected to critics and presented himself as a champion of progressive culture, while ignoring the fact that it was critics who picked the winner of the prize he was awarding. It is the K Foundation, rather than Whiteread, who represent a vital and innovative strand within contemporary culture. Their work is simultaneously a critique and a celebration of '[[consumer capitalism]]'."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stewart Home|Home, S.]], "Doctorin' Our Culture", published on the website of The Stewart Home Society ([http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/klf.htm link])&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New Musical Express]]'' piece on 20 November 1993 was also highly supportive of the K Foundation. "The nearest parallel to the K Foundation donation would be [[The Beatles]]' grandiose plans for [[Apple Corps]]", they said. "But where Apple handed out money willy-nilly to little end and failed to achieve anything more than get some hippies stoned and put up some nice posters about war being over if you want it, Drummond and Cauty have found a specific target - the relationship between art, money and the critical establishment- and attacked it. By actually offering £40,000 to the artist who produces the duffest piece of work, they've simultaneously sent up the whole thing and proved their integrity the hard way."&lt;ref&gt;"Tate tat and arty", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 20 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=359 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' magazine's witness wrote that "The accusation that this is a tiresome [[Situationist International|Situationist]] gag with a [[whoopee cushion]] pay-off belittles the K Foundation's distracted message. They are not mocking any of the artists involved in the Turner or their work so much as the whole tired institution of awards themselves.... By telling us to "use our critical faculties or our innate prejudice" to vote, the Ks are asking: "Who decides who decides?""&lt;!-- repeated reference but without passim and note; so redo it--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"K Foundation: Nailed To The Wall", ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'', January 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=374 link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alix Sharkey in "Trash Art &amp; Kreation" named ''The Face''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s witness as Cliff Jones and quoted further praise from him.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Independent]]'''s witness, David Lister, was less impressed. "Last night's highly eccentric [[mystery tour]] by the K Foundation probably said more about the wealth that can be accumulated from two number one hit records than it did about any resurgence of [[Dadaism]]", he said.&lt;ref name="Lister"/&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' said that Jimmy Cauty, "[as the artist] responsible for a best-selling [[Athena (retailer)|Athena]] poster of the [[Hobbit]] ... can justly say he has adorned more walls than any of the Turner nominees"; and added: "A grand deflation of the pretensions of the wealthy art elite is an aim that has drawn approval from sections of the art world and philistines who find 'installations' of knotted rope or beds covered in rice curiously unmoving.... The joke may yet prove to be at the expense of the Turner."&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Neil, "A guerrilla raid on the arts establishment", ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([[Manchester]]) ISSN 0261-3077 , 31 October 1993, ''The Observer Review Page''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate piece, the newspaper implied that the K Foundation had hit their perceived target with some success:{{cquote|The abiding image of this year's Turner Prize will not be the poignant, graffiti-scarred hulk of Rachel Whiteread's House, marooned in the swirling dereliction of the [[East End]], nor even [[Vong Phaophanit]]'s gently undulating rice dunes inside the Tate.

The picture that really grabbed hold of the zeitgeist, and which will stay in the memory long after the dust of demolition settles, was the grim sight of [[Peter Palumbo, Baron Palumbo|Peter Palumbo]], handing Whiteread her cheque at the Tate on Tuesday night. His face white and sweaty, vainly trying to appear martial, he looked for all the world like the late [[Salvador Allende]] in his tin helmet, clutching his assault rifle on the steps of the presidential palace as [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]'s tanks swept him from power....

Perhaps the Turner Prize could handle routine local authority philistinism, but the heavy-handed [[The Magic Christian (novel)|Magic Christian]] mockery of the KLF, the group of rock biz pranksters who doubled the prize money with an award for what they called the worst artist of the four on the shortlist, seemed to be too much for the Prize's fragile sense of purpose. The equilibrium of its greatest defender had cracked.&lt;ref&gt;Sudjic, D., "Art attack The arts establishment found itself on the defensive this week when it gave the Turner Prize to a concrete casting of a house. But who cares what the pundits think?", ''[[The Guardian]]'' (Manchester), ISSN 0261-3077 , 25 November 1993, ''The Guardian Features Page''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Later analysis==
In a piece published in 2006, ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' quoted author James F. English's description of The K Foundation's Art Award as "hostile philanthropy".&lt;ref&gt;English, J. F., ''THE ECONOMY OF PRESTIGE Prizes, Awards and the Circulation of Cultural Value'' ({{ISBN|0-674-01884-2}}), [[Harvard University Press]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sunday Times'' writer [[Bryan Appleyard]] added that the "K Foundation's witty exploitations of artistic greed ... are essential aspects of the prize itself. They promote the prize, reassure the organisers that, culturally speaking, they are in the thick of it and console the artists with evidence that their work provokes strong reactions. More importantly, for English, such conflicts demonstrate the autonomous nature of the event. These prizes should not be seen as any real or lasting judgment about art, but rather as things in themselves."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Appleyard|Appleyard, B.]], "And the winners are...", ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' (London), 8 January 2006, Features p52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years after the award, Bill Drummond attempted to explain the K Foundation's motives, as he now saw them:
{{cquote|Most of the people who wrote about what we did, and the TV programme that was made about it, made a mistake. I was only able to articulate it to myself afterwards with hindsight. They thought we were using our money to make a statement about art, and really what we were doing was using our art to make a statement about money. Having arrived at that formula, I'm probably manipulating everything we did to fit into the theory, but we were just getting up in the morning and getting on the phone with each other and saying, fucking hell! So at some points we thought we were attacking the art establishment then we were saying, no that's not what this is about.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, B., "King Boy D", interview with [[Bill Drummond]], ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', March 1997 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=435 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Burning==
The K Foundation's art campaign, ''Money: A Major Body Of Cash'', failed to attract major gallery interest so, on 23 August 1994, Drummond and Cauty disposed of their one million pounds in an alternate fashion: they burnt it on the Scottish island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]].&lt;ref&gt;"Burning Question", ''[[The Observer]]'', 13 Feb 2000 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=486 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid]]). In an interview with Drummond, Cauty and Gimpo, Gimpo admitted to harbouring guilt about the million pounds burning; that if he'd burnt Whiteread's £40,000 the million pounds burning would never have happened. "I should have burnt it. I had petrol all over the £40,000... We were due to wait until eleven o'clock until she came out, but we were told to wait another two minutes... [then] Rachel Whiteread came running out. She just grabbed the money and dragged it over the fence."&lt;ref name="database"&gt;[[Alan Goodrick (Gimpo)]], interviewed by Dower, John, and Greer, Dave, "The K Foundation: Why we burnt a million pounds", ''Thee Data Base'' fanzine, 1 March 1996 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=416 link 1], [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/7535/KFound.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:45:01 link 2])&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Freedman also wished they'd burnt Whiteread's money. "It would have been brilliant.... It would have been just totally outrageous. People would have been falling out of their-chairs, saying. 'I can't believe they just burned £40,000'".&lt;ref name="Trash"/&gt;

[[File:Ann SHERIDAN-James CAGNEY-Angels Dirty Faces-PHOTO2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ann Sheridan]] as [[James Cagney]]'s leading lady in ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'']]
'''Leading lady''' is a term often applied to the [[leading actress]] in the performance if her [[fictional character|character]] is the [[protagonist]]. It is also an informal term for the [[actress]] who plays a secondary lead, usually a [[love interest]], to the [[leading actor]] in a film or play. 

A leading lady can also be an actress of renown. For example, [[Lynn Fontanne]] and [[Helen Hayes]] were both referred to as the "leading lady of the theatre" in their time. Similarly, [[Mary Pickford]] was called the "leading lady" of the cinema.

The term has been applied to an actress who is often associated with one particular actor. For example, [[Olivia de Havilland]] was [[Errol Flynn]]'s leading lady in several films, [[Katharine Hepburn]] had a similar association with [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Lauren Bacall]] with [[Humphrey Bogart]], and [[Maureen O'Hara]] with [[John Wayne]]. A leading lady is also an actress who is [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in romantic supporting roles.

The term can also be used collectively; for example, the phrase "[[Hollywood]]'s leading ladies" can be used to refer to a group of notable, famous, or popular actresses.

Many modern day leading ladies includes: [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Patricia Arquette]], [[Angela Bassett]], [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Claire Danes]], [[Viola Davis]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Mariska Hargitay]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Jessica Lange]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Blake Lively]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Eva Mendes]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Elisabeth Moss]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Sarah Paulson]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Rihanna]], [[Julia Roberts]], [[Margot Robbie]], [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Hailee Steinfeld]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Emma Stone]], [[Emma Watson]], [[Rebel Wilson]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Reese Witherspoon]] and [[Sofia Vergara]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6237">'''Maternalism''' is the viewpoint that incorporates a common idea of [[femininity]] and applies it as a support for women’s involvement in society.

==History==
Maternalism emerged in the late 19th Century, as a companion to [[progressive reform]]. The [[theology]] followed the idea that women had in-born qualities based on their maternalistic instincts. These inborn qualities qualified women to operate outside the home. Women of this time argued that women were uniquely qualified for certain jobs and places in the [[political sphere]] based on their domestic abilities and child-rearing qualities.
This political mindset continued into the 20th century, influencing government reform and females in the [[workplace]].&lt;ref name="Muncy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muncy|first1=Robyn|title=Creating a Female Dominion in Reform, 1890-1935|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195089240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mink"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mink|first1=Gwendolyn|title=The wages of motherhood : inequality in the welfare state, 1917-1942|date=1996|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=978-0801495342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternalistic professionals, particularly medical doctors, do not dictate to people what to do. They guide their clients gently and give them autonomy without making them feel totally alone or unsupported. Maternalistic people allow people to make decisions, even if they end up being mistakes in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/elizabeth-horn/maternalism-in-medicine_b_6566736.html Maternalism in Medicine] at Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

===Progressive reform===
[[Social settlement]]s, founded mainly by middle class women, became popular in urban environments in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. They provided [[public housing]] and resources to working-class people and newly arrived [[immigrant]]s. Middle class women who ran these settlements worked with immigrants for progressive reform, such as the regulation of [[workers' compensation]] and [[child labor]] laws. Major settlements included [[Hull House]] in Chicago and [[Toynbee Hall]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=2016|chapter=Social settlement|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/social-settlement|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Female Professions===
Acceptable female work during this time included school teachers and nursing. In 1910,
5%-6% of Doctors were female;
1% of Lawyers were female;
1% of Clergy were female.
Women achieved greater success in creating female oriented jobs than breaking into male dominated jobs during this time, by creating professions designed around their domestic and maternal qualities.&lt;ref name="Muncy"/&gt; [[Home Economics]] emerged in the 1890s at MIT and the University of Chicago. Women studied science and used experiments to influence politics. Female-led labs studied ways to create cleaner water and better American sewers.
[[Public Health Nursing]] was created as an alternative to traditional nursing. This allowed women to have their own private practices and to not have to work under men. However, most women served communities who couldn’t pay, which limited their resources and income. [[Social work]] primarily operated in social settlements, serving immigrant women and children. Since many of their clients could not pay, social workers were key players in pushing for progressive reform.&lt;ref name="Muncy"/&gt;

==Major Players==
[[Ellen Swallow Richards]] was a chemist who graduated from Uc Madera in california and founded Home Economics. Richards set up labs at Universities across the country aimed at sanitation and teaching women the sciences. Richards was a key player in maternalist politics as she applied her scientific knowledge to domestic issues in politics, pushing for good nutrition and sanitation.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellen H. Swallow Richards|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/ellen-h-swallow-richards|website=Science History Institute |accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lugenia Burns Hope]] was one of the first professional social workers. In 1908 in Atlanta Georgia she founded the Neighborhood Union, which aimed to mobilize and enfranchise poor black neighborhoods in the city.&lt;ref name="Cardoza-Oquendo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cardoza-Oquendo|first1=Juan|title=Lugenia Burns Hope|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/lugenia-burns-hope-1871-1947|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jane Addams]] co-founded Hull House in Chicago in 1889.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; A strong proponent for maternalist politics and progressive reform, she started many initiatives such as clean food and clean drinking water, which gained momentum in the social movement.&lt;ref name="Muncy"/&gt;

==Critique==
Maternalism has been criticized on the grounds that it keeps women out of male dominated professions.  It also reinforces a normalized idea of femininity, without considering the fluidity of gender.&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=Eirinn|title=Gender and the welfare state: Maternalism - a new historical concept?|date=1996|publisher=University of Bergen, Norway|url=http://www.ub.uib.no/elpub/1996/h/506002/eirinn/eirinn.html|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way that advertisers had used images of strong working women to encourage women to enter the workforce in support of the war effort, advertisers after the war presented images of maternalism to pressure women to leave the workforce and return to their homes, so that positions could be filled by men returning from wartime. Women were told that their nurturing abilities would be better served waiting on their husbands and children.&lt;ref name="Weigand"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weigand|first1=Kate|title=Red feminism : American communism and the making of women's liberation|date=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md. ; London|isbn=978-0801871115|pages=46–47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2S-a6fBuNsEC&amp;pg=PA46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned.jpg|thumb|Edward Gibbon, by Henry Walton, 1773]]
'''''Memoirs of My Life and Writings''''' (1796) is an account of the historian [[Edward Gibbon]]'s life, compiled after his death by his friend [[John Baker Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]] from six fragmentary autobiographical works Gibbon wrote during his last years.  Lord Sheffield's editing has been praised for its ingenuity and taste, but blamed for its unscholarly aggressiveness.  Since 1896 several other editions of the work have appeared, more in accordance with modern standards.  Gibbon's ''Memoirs'' are considered one of the first autobiographies in the modern sense of the word, and have a secure place in the canon of English literature.

== Synopsis ==

Gibbon begins with an account of his ancestors before moving on to his birth and education, which was partly private and partly at [[Westminster School]].  He matriculated as a student at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], an institution which he found at a low ebb.
&lt;blockquote&gt;To the university of Oxford I acknowledge no obligation; and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son, as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother. I spent fourteen months at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]]; they proved the fourteen months the most idle and unprofitable of my whole life.{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=22}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Of one of his tutors Gibbon says that he "well remembered that he had a salary to receive, and only forgot that he had a duty to perform."{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=27}}  Gibbon's father took alarm on learning that he had converted to Roman Catholicism and, in order to bring him back to the Protestant fold, sent him to live with a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] minister in [[Lausanne]].  Gibbon made good use of his time in [[Switzerland]], meeting [[Voltaire]] and other literary figures, and perfecting his command of the French language.  He also fell in love with a Swiss girl, [[Suzanne Curchod]], but his wish to marry her was implacably opposed by his father.  "I sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a son."{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=48}}  On returning to England he published his first work, the ''Essai sur l'étude de la littérature''.  The next major event Gibbon mentions was his taking a commission in the [[67th (South Hampshire) Regiment of Foot|Hampshire militia]], an experience which he tells us was later to be of advantage to him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The discipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a clearer notion of the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] and the [[Roman legion|legion]]; and the captain of the Hampshire grenadiers (the reader may smile) has not been useless to the historian of the Roman empire.{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=62}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He then details his travels through France and on to Lausanne, where he formed a friendship with John Holroyd, later Lord Sheffield, which was to last for the rest of his life.  Gibbon crossed the Alps into Italy and eventually reached Rome.  He had for some time wanted to begin writing a history, without being able to choose a subject, but now, he tells us, the exciting experience of walking in the footsteps of the heroes of antiquity gave him a new idea:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was at Rome, on the 15th of October, 1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the bare-footed friars were singing vespers in the temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind.{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=82}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After returning to England Gibbon engaged in several other literary exercises before finally beginning to write [[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|his Roman history]].  The ''Memoirs'' now give a detailed account of the years he spent producing its successive volumes, and of the many hostile criticisms his work attracted.  These labours were diversified by his experiences as a [[Member of Parliament]], and his writing, at the request of the Government, a "Mémoire justificatif" asserting the justice of [[France in the American Revolutionary War|British hostilities against France]] at the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]].  During the course of writing the ''Decline and Fall'' Gibbon moved back to Lausanne.  Gibbon's ''Memoirs'' end with a survey of the factors he considered had combined to bring him a happy and productive life.

== Composition and manuscripts ==

Gibbon wrote a short account of his life in French in 1783.{{sfn|Bowersock|2009|p=47}} For five years he made no attempt to add to this, but in June 1788, one month after the last volumes of ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' were published, he began work on the ''Memoirs'' by writing to the [[College of Arms]] for information about his ancestry.  For the remaining years of his life he struggled with the task of recording his life in a satisfactory way, and his death in 1794 came before he could resolve the problem.  Six attempts at an autobiography have survived, conventionally identified by the letters '''A''' to '''F''':{{sfn|Gawthrop|1999|pp=188–189}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''A''': ''The Memoirs of the life of Edward Gibbon with various observations and excursions by himself'' (1788–1789).  40 [[quarto]] pages (6 missing).&lt;br/&gt;'''B''': ''My own Life'' (1788–1789).  72 quarto pages.  Describes the first 27 years of his life.&lt;br/&gt;'''C''': ''Memoirs of the life and writings of Edward Gibbon'' (1789).  41 [[folio]] pages plus insert.  Describes the first 35 years of his life.&lt;br/&gt;'''D''': [Untitled] (1790–1791).  13 folio pages.  Describing the first 35 years of his life.&lt;br/&gt;'''E''': ''My own Life'' (c. 1792–1793).  19 folio pages of text, and twelve of notes.  Describing the first 54 years of his life.&lt;br/&gt;'''F''': [Untitled] (1792–1793).  41 folio pages of text, and 7 of notes.  Describing the first 16 years of his life.{{sfn|Smith|1989|p=29}}{{sfn|Gawthrop|1999|pp=189, 191}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the drafts of the work succeeded each other Gibbon in some passages varied the emphasis, and even changed the facts, but where he was satisfied with the words of the previous version he simply transcribed them.{{sfn|Womersley|2004–2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardgibbonstudies.com/EG-MiscWorks5.htm |title=Edward Gibbon – Miscellaneous Works |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Edward Gibbon Studies |accessdate=11 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130914105442/http://www.edwardgibbonstudies.com/EG-MiscWorks5.htm |archivedate=14 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''E''' is the only version to cover his whole life, and perhaps the only one he wrote with a view to publication during his own lifetime,{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=209}} but it omits many things included in the other versions.  As he wrote to Lord Sheffield,
&lt;blockquote&gt;A man may state many things in a posthumous work, that he might not in another; the latter often checks the introduction of many curious thoughts and facts.{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=210}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Gibbon's struggles with his autobiography were ended by his death in 1794.  All six manuscripts then fell into the hands of his literary executor, Lord Sheffield, who used them to produce his own composite edition.  They remained undisturbed in the possession of his family, until in 1871 his son [[George Holroyd, 2nd Earl of Sheffield]], lent them to the medical writer [[William Alexander Greenhill]], who established their chronological order of composition and gave them the letters by which they are now always identified.  In 1895 the manuscripts were sold by the [[Henry Holroyd, 3rd Earl of Sheffield|3rd earl]] to the [[British Museum]], where they were bound together. They remain in the [[British Library]] as Add. MS. 34874.{{sfn|Bonnard|1964|p=207}}{{sfn|Smith|1989|pp=17, 29–30}}{{sfn|Womersley|2004–2013}}

== Editing and publication ==

Attempting to bring the manuscripts into a publishable state, Lord Sheffield found himself in a quandary.  Of all the versions available to him, only '''E''' could be called a complete narrative of Gibbon's life up to the 1790s, yet this one was very short on detail, and by no means a substantial work.  The other manuscripts were more circumstantial, but all left the story unfinished.  His solution was to produce a composite version, taking passages or individual sentences from each, especially from '''F''', and shaping them into an artistically satisfying whole.{{sfn|Gawthrop|1999|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Womersley|2004–2013}}{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=239}}  Choosing the title ''Memoirs of My Life and Writings'', he made the resulting work the centerpiece of a collection of inedited Gibboniana published in 1796 in two quarto volumes as ''[[Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon|Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon Esquire]]''.{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Gawthrop|1999|pp=196–197}}  The work was reprinted many times through the 19th century, and remained the only published form of Gibbon's autobiography until 1896, when the publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] produced an edition giving the full text of all six manuscripts.{{sfn|Anon.|1897|p=210}}  Two years later the American scholar [[Oliver Farrar Emerson]] edited the manuscripts along similar lines.{{sfn|Bonnard|1964|p=207}}  In 1966 Georges Bonnard returned to Lord Sheffield’s plan of producing an [[Textual criticism#Eclecticism|eclectic]] edition, though with far greater scholarly conscientiousness.{{sfn|Burgess|1966|p=521}}  The last major new edition of Gibbon's ''Memoirs'' was the work of [[Betty Radice]], and appeared in the Penguin English Library series in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Craddock |first1=Patricia B. |authorlink1=Patricia Craddock |title=Edward Gibbon: A Reference Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=4ZYnUpSXK5CXhQeD7oAw&amp;id=yoXgAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22memoirs+of+my+life%22+gibbon+radice+bonnard&amp;q=radice+harmondsworth#search_anchor |accessdate=11 September 2013 |year=1987 |publisher=G.

== Reception ==

So high is the critical repute of Gibbon's ''Memoirs'' that ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature|The Cambridge History of English Literature]]'' declared it had "by general consent…established itself as one of the most fascinating books of its class in English literature".{{sfn|Ward|1913|p=299}}  One reason for this is the candour and openness with which Gibbon speaks of himself.  "Few men, I believe," Lord Sheffield wrote, "have ever so fully unveiled their own character".{{sfn|Fenton|2006}}  Again, Gibbon broke new ground in making it a truly "philosophical", that is to say analytical, autobiography; as the novelist [[Anthony Burgess]] wrote, "the sense of intellectual control, of a life somehow grasped as a concept, is unmatched".{{sfn|Burgess|1966|p=521}}  It is widely held that Gibbon's ''Memoirs'', along with the ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], brought the modern autobiography into being.{{sfn|Carnochan|1987|p=4}}{{sfn|Fenton|2006}}

In recent years much has been written by critics on Gibbon's failure to reach a final recension of his autobiography.  It has been explained in various ways: as a sign of Gibbon's wrestling with difficulties of literary form; as a result of disagreements between Gibbon and Sheffield as to how far the ''Memoirs'' should follow [[Edmund Burke]]'s interpretation of the [[French Revolution]]; or in psychoanalytic terms as the reflection of an uncertainty in Gibbon's mind as to his own identity.{{sfn|Womersley|2002|pp=207–240}}

When, with the publication of Murray's edition, it became possible to judge Sheffield's role in conflating the different versions of the ''Memoirs'', some critics accorded him praise moderated by their shock at finding how large a part he had played.  The historian [[Frederic Harrison]]'s opinion was that he had performed his task with "great skill and tact, but with the most daring freedom";{{sfn|Ward|1913|p=299}} and an anonymous writer in the ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' said of Sheffield that
&lt;blockquote&gt;with an ingenuity which, in spite of its perversity, cannot but be admired, he concocted out of the six [manuscripts] a patchwork narrative, which has since always passed as Gibbon's autobiography. In reality it was nothing of the kind, and should have been called not ''Gibbon's Autobiography'' but ''Selections from the Autobiographical Remains of Edward Gibbon''.{{sfn|Anon.|1987|p=210}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
20th and 21st centuries critical opinions of Sheffield's work as an editor have diverged widely.  In 1913 the ''Cambridge History of English Literature'' called it "extraordinarily skillful", and in the 1960s Anthony Burgess wrote of "Six holograph sketches, out of which Lord Sheffield stitched not a patchwork but a tasteful and well-fitting suit of clothes."{{sfn|Ward|1913|p=299}}{{sfn|Burgess|1966|p=521}}  The academic W. B. Carnochan called Sheffield's editing "brilliant though high-handed",{{sfn|Carnochan|1987|p=125}} and pointed out that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Were it not for his unremitting labors, we would not think of Gibbon as having written a great autobiography; rather, we would think of him as a historian who tried to write an autobiography but failed.{{sfn|Carnochan|1987|p=4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The academic David Womersley has written in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' that Sheffield did the job "With equal judgement, freedom, and shrewdness", but elsewhere he has conceded that "From our standpoint…Sheffield's handling of Gibbon’s manuscript was scandalous.".{{sfn|Womersley|2004–2013}}{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=362}}  This last judgement has been endorsed by the historian [[Glen Bowersock]], while the Gibbon scholar Jane Elizabeth Norton said that "By all the standards of scholarship, Lord Sheffield's conduct was deplorable."{{sfn|Bowersock|2009|p=51}}{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=362}}

Almost all moai have overly large heads three-eighths the size of the whole statue. The moai are chiefly the living faces (''aringa ora'') of deified ancestors (''aringa ora ata tepuna'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Van Tilburg, Jo Anne |url=http://www.eisp.org/ |title=Easter Island Statue Project |publisher=Eisp.org |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statues still gazed inland across their clan lands when Europeans first visited the island in 1722, but all of them had fallen by the latter part of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="The Statues That Walked" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Moai Rano raraku.jpg|thumb|Moai set in the hillside at [[Rano Raraku]]]]
The moai are monolithic statues, their minimalist style related to forms found throughout [[Polynesia]]. Moai are carved in relatively flat planes, the faces bearing proud but enigmatic expressions. The human figures would be outlined in the rock wall first, then chipped away until only the image was left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What are Moai? |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/06aug/02100/easterislandmoai.htm |publisher=Thinkquest (discontinued) |accessdate=6 October 2018 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130725155331/http://library.thinkquest.org/06aug/02100/easterislandmoai.htm |archivedate=2013-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The over-large heads (a three-to-five ratio between the head and the trunk, a sculptural trait that demonstrates the Polynesian belief in the sanctity of the chiefly head) have heavy brows and elongated noses with a distinctive fish-hook-shaped curl of the nostrils. The lips protrude in a thin pout. Like the nose, the ears are elongated and oblong in form. The jaw lines stand out against the truncated neck. The torsos are heavy, and, sometimes, the clavicles are subtly outlined in stone. The arms are carved in [[bas relief]] and rest against the body in various positions, hands and long slender fingers resting along the crests of the hips, meeting at the hami (loincloth), with the thumbs sometimes pointing towards the navel. Generally, the anatomical features of the backs are not detailed, but sometimes bear a ring and girdle motif on the buttocks and lower back. Except for one kneeling moai, the statues do not have clearly visible legs.
[[File:Cantera de moais.jpg|thumb|Moais quarry at Rano Raraku]]
[[File:Ahu-Tongariki-2013.jpg|300px|right|thumb|All fifteen standing moai at Ahu Tongariki.]]
Though moai are whole-body statues, they are erroneously referred to as "Easter Island heads" in some popular literature. This is partly because of the disproportionate size of most moai heads, and partly because many of the iconic images for the island showing upright moai are the statues on the slopes of [[Rano Raraku]], many of which are buried to their shoulders. Some of the "heads" at Rano Raraku have been excavated and their bodies seen, and observed to have markings that had been protected from erosion by their burial.

The average height of the moai is about {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with the average width at the base around {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}. These massive creations usually weigh around 12.5 tonnes (13.8 tons) each.

All but 53 of the more than 900 moai known to date were carved from [[tuff]] (a compressed volcanic ash) from Rano Raraku, where 394 moai in varying states of completion are still visible today. There are also 13 moai carved from [[basalt]], 22 from [[trachyte]] and 17 from fragile red [[scoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Tilburg |first=Jo Anne |year=1994 |title=Easter Island: Archaeology, Ecology and Culture |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=infjAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=scoria }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of carving, the builders would rub the statue with [[pumice]].

===Characteristics===
[[File:Ahu Tahai.jpg|thumb|Re-erected tuff moai at Ahu Tahai with restored [[pukao]] and replica eyes]]
Easter Island statues are known for their large, broad noses and strong chins, along with rectangle-shaped ears and deep eye slits. Their bodies are normally [[Squatting position|squatting]], with their arms resting in different positions and are without legs. The majority of the ahu are found along the coast and face inland towards the community.  There are some inland ahu such as [[Ahu Akivi]]. These moai face the community but given the small size of the island, also appear to face the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/easter/civilization/giants.html |title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Secrets of Easter Island &amp;#124; Stone Giants |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eyes====
In 1979, [[Sergio Rapu Haoa]] and a team of archaeologists discovered that the hemispherical or deep elliptical eye sockets were designed to hold coral eyes with either black [[obsidian]] or red scoria pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanities360.com/index.php/views-on-the-origin-and-purpose-of-the-easter-island-statues-11596/|title=Views on the origin and purpose of the Easter Island statues|first=Nick|last=Ford|date=15 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630130949/http://www.humanities360.com/index.php/views-on-the-origin-and-purpose-of-the-easter-island-statues-11596/|archivedate=30 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery was made by collecting and reassembling broken fragments of white coral that were found at the various sites. Subsequently, previously uncategorized finds in the Easter Island museum were re-examined and recategorized as eye fragments. It is thought that the moai with carved eye sockets were probably allocated to the ahu and ceremonial sites, suggesting that a selective Rapa Nui hierarchy was attributed to the moai design until its demise with the advent of the Birdman religion, [[Tangata Manu]].

===Symbolism===
Many archaeologists suggest that "[the] statues were thus symbols of authority and power, both religious and political. But they were not only symbols. To the people who erected and used them, they were actual repositories of sacred spirit. Carved stone and wooden objects in ancient Polynesian religions, when properly fashioned and ritually prepared, were believed to be charged by a magical spiritual essence called mana."{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
Archaeologists believe that the statues were a representation of the ancient Polynesians' ancestors. The moai statues face away from the ocean and towards the villages as if to watch over the people. The exception is the seven Ahu Akivi which face out to sea to help travelers find the island. There is a legend that says there were seven men who waited for their king to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;"Mystery of the Easter Island Statues." Red Ice Creations. N.p., 27 Oct. 2011. Web. 30 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Pukao'' topknots and headdresses====
{{Main|Pukao}}
The more recent moai had ''[[pukao]]'' on their heads, which represent the [[Māori people|topknot]] of the chieftains. According to local tradition, the [[mana]] was preserved in the hair. The [[pukao]] were carved out of red scoria, a very light rock from a quarry at [[Puna Pau]]. Red itself is considered a sacred color in Polynesia. The added pukao suggest a further status to the moai.&lt;ref name="The Rise 2013"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Rise &amp; Fall of Easter Island's Culture. Sentinels in Stone |url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/easter/sentinels_in_stone.php |publisher=Bradshaw Foundation |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- ORIG INFORMATION: 29 Oct. 2013. --&gt;

[[File:Hoa hakananai.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Hoa Hakananai'a]] in the [[British Museum]]]]

====Markings (post stone working)====

When first carved, the surface of the moai was polished smooth by rubbing with pumice. Unfortunately, the easily worked tuff from which most moai were carved is also easily eroded, and, today, the best place to see the surface detail is on the few moai carved from basalt or in photographs and other archaeological records of moai surfaces protected by burials.

Those moai that are less eroded typically have designs carved on their backs and posteriors. The [[Katherine Routledge|Routledge]] expedition of 1914 established a cultural link&lt;ref&gt;[[Katherine Routledge]] (1919) ''The Mystery of Easter Island'' {{ISBN|0-932813-48-8}} page 220&lt;/ref&gt; between these designs and the island's traditional tattooing, which had been repressed by missionaries a half-century earlier. Until modern DNA analysis of the islanders and their ancestors, this was key scientific evidence that the moai had been carved by the Rapa Nui and not by a separate group from [[South America]].

At least some of the moai were painted; ''[[Hoa Hakananai'a]]'' was decorated with maroon and white paint until 1868, when it was removed from the island. It is now housed in the [[British Museum]], London, but there are demands (2018) for its return to Rapa Nui.

==History==
[[File:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|260px|Map of [[Easter Island]] using moai to show locations of various [[Easter Island#Ahu|''ahu'']]]]
The statues were carved by the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] colonizers of the island, mostly between circa 1250 A.D. and 1500 A.D.&lt;ref name="fischer"&gt;Steven R Fischer. ''The island at the end of the world.'' Reaktion Books 2005 {{ISBN|1-86189-282-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to representing deceased [[ancestor worship|ancestor]]s, the moai, once they were erected on ahu, may also have been regarded as the embodiment of powerful living or former chiefs and important lineage status symbols.  Each moai presented a status: "The larger the statue placed upon an ahu, the more mana the chief who commissioned it had."&lt;ref name="The Rise 2013"/&gt; The competition for grandest statue was ever prevalent in the culture of the Easter Islanders. The proof stems from the varying sizes of moai.&lt;ref name="The Rise 2013"/&gt;

Completed statues were moved to ahu mostly on the coast, then erected, sometimes with red stone cylinders (pukao) on their heads. Moai must have been extremely expensive to craft and transport; not only would the actual carving of each statue require effort and resources, but the finished product was then hauled to its final location and erected.

[[File:Isla de Pascua, Chile. 03.jpg|thumb|An incomplete moai in quarry]]

The quarries in Rano Raraku appear to have been abandoned abruptly, with a litter of stone tools and many completed moai outside the quarry awaiting transport and almost as many incomplete statues still ''in situ'' as were installed on ahu. In the nineteenth century, this led to conjecture that the island was the remnant of a [[Mu (lost continent)#Easter Island|sunken continent]] and that most completed moai were under the sea. That idea has long been debunked, and now it is understood that:
* Some statues were rock carvings and never intended to be completed.
* Some were incomplete because, when [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusion]]s were encountered, the carvers would abandon a partial statue and start a new one&lt;ref&gt;[[Katherine Routledge]] (1919) ''The Mystery of Easter Island'' {{ISBN|0-932813-48-8}} page 181&lt;/ref&gt; (tuff is a soft rock with occasional lumps of much harder rock included in it).
* Some completed statues at Rano Raraku were placed there permanently and not parked temporarily awaiting removal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Katherine Routledge]] (1919) ''The Mystery of Easter Island'' {{ISBN|0-932813-48-8}} page 186&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some were indeed incomplete when the statue-building era came to an end.

===Craftsmen===
It is not known exactly which group in the communities were responsible for carving statues.  Oral traditions suggest that the moai were either carved by a distinguished class of professional carvers who were comparable in status to high-ranking members of other Polynesian craft guilds, or, alternatively, by members of each clan. The oral histories show that the [[Rano Raraku]] quarry was subdivided into different territories for each clan.

{{Cleanup section|reason=the section is not chronological with its exploration of different theories and the ongoing debate.|date=June 2014}}
Since the island was largely treeless by the time the Europeans first visited, the movement of the statues was a mystery for a long time; pollen analysis has now established that the island was almost totally forested until 1200 A.D. The tree pollen disappeared from the record by 1650.

It is not known exactly how the moai were moved across the island.  Earlier researchers assumed that the process almost certainly required human energy, ropes, and possibly wooden sledges (sleds) and/or rollers, as well as leveled tracks across the island (the Easter Island roads). Another theory suggests that the moai were placed on top of logs and were rolled to their destinations.&lt;ref&gt;The human figures would be outlined in the rock wall first, then chipped away until only the image was left.[6]&lt;/ref&gt; If that theory is correct it would take 50-150 people to move the moai.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  The most recent study demonstrates from the evidence in the archaeological record that the statues were harnessed with ropes from two sides and made to "walk" by tilting them from side to side while pulling forward.&lt;ref name="The Statues That Walked" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carl P.

Oral histories recount how various people used divine power to command the statues to walk. The earliest accounts say a king named Tuu Ku Ihu moved them with the help of the god [[Makemake (mythology)|Makemake]], while later stories tell of a woman who lived alone on the mountain ordering them about at her will. Scholars currently support the theory that the main method was that the moai were "walked" upright (some assume by a rocking process), as laying it prone on a sledge (the method used by the Easter Islanders to move stone in the 1860s) would have required an estimated 1500 people to move the largest moai that had been successfully erected. In 1998, [[Jo Anne Van Tilburg]] suggested fewer than half that number could do it by placing the sledge on lubricated rollers. In 1999, she supervised an experiment to move a nine-tonne moai. They attempted to load a replica on a sledge built in the shape of an ''A'' frame that was placed on rollers. A total of 60 people pulled on several ropes in two attempts to tow the moai. The first attempt failed when the rollers jammed up. The second attempt succeeded when they embedded tracks in the ground. This was on flat ground and used eucalyptus wood rather than the native palm trees.&lt;ref name="histchan-megamovers"&gt;History channel "Mega Movers: Ancient Mystery Moves"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MoaiProtectionSign.jpg|thumb|250px|Sign indicating the protected status of the moai]]

In 1986, [[Pavel Pavel]], [[Thor Heyerdahl]] and the [[Kon Tiki Museum]] experimented with a five-tonne moai and a nine-tonne moai. With a rope around the head of the statue and another around the base, using eight workers for the smaller statue and 16 for the larger, they "walked" the moai forward by swiveling and rocking it from side to side; however, the experiment was ended early due to damage to the statue bases from chipping. Despite the early end to the experiment, Thor Heyerdahl estimated that this method for a 20-tonne statue over Easter Island terrain would allow {{convert|320|ft|m|-1}} per day. Other scholars concluded that it was probably not the way the moai were moved due to the reported damage to the base caused by the "shuffling" motion.&lt;ref name="histchan-megamovers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Easter Island--the mystery solved / Thor Heyerdahl 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, archaeologist [[Charles Love]] experimented with a 10-tonne replica. His first experiment found rocking the statue to walk it was too unstable over more than a few hundred yards. He then found that placing the statue upright on two sled runners atop log rollers, 25 men were able to move the statue {{convert|150|ft|m}} in two minutes. In 2003, further research indicated this method could explain supposedly regularly spaced post holes (his research on this claim has not yet been published) where the statues were moved over rough ground. He suggested the holes contained upright posts on either side of the path so that as the statue passed between them, they were used as cantilevers for poles to help push the statue up a slope without the requirement of extra people pulling on the ropes and similarly to slow it on the downward slope. The poles could also act as a brake when needed.&lt;ref name="Flenley"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Flenley |first=John |title=The Enigmas of Easter Island: Island on the Edge|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003 |isbn=0-19-280340-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on detailed studies of the statues found along prehistoric roads, archaeologists [[Terry Hunt]] and [[Carl Lipo]] have shown that the pattern of breakage, form and position of statues is consistent with an "upright" hypothesis for transportation.&lt;ref name="The Statues That Walked"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Hunt |first1=Terry |last2=Lipo |first2=Carl |title=The Statues That Walked: Unraveling the Mystery of Easter Island|publisher=Free Press|year=2012|isbn=1-4391-5031-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt and Lipo argue that when the statues were carved at a quarry, the sculptors left their bases wide and curved along the front edge. They showed that statues along the road have a center of mass that causes the statue to lean forward. As the statue tilts forward, it rocks sideways along its curved front edge and takes a "step."  Large flakes are seen broken off of the sides of the bases. They argue that once the statue was "walked" down the road and installed in the landscape, the wide and curved base was carved down.&lt;ref name="The Statues Walked"&gt;http://longnow.org/seminars/02013/jan/17/statues-walked-what-really-happened-easter-island/&lt;/ref&gt; All of this evidence points to an upright transportation practice.

Recent experimental recreations have proven that it is fully possible that the moai were literally walked from their quarries to their final positions by ingenious use of ropes. Teams of workers would have worked to rock the moai back and forth, creating the walking motion and holding the moai upright.&lt;ref name=NatGeoJuly2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOVA Easter Island"&gt;{{cite video

===Birdman cult===
{{main|Tangata manu}}

Originally, Easter Islanders had a paramount chief or single leader.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Through the years the power levels veered from sole chiefs to a warrior class, known as "matatoa". The [[Therianthropy|therianthropic]] figure of a half bird and half man was the symbol of the matatoa; the distinct character connected the sacred site of Orongo. The new cult prompted battles of tribes over worship of ancestry. Creating the moai was one way the islanders would honor their ancestors; during the height of the birdman cult there is evidence which suggests that the construction of moai stopped.

"One of the most fascinating sights at Orongo are the hundreds of petroglyphs carved with birdman and Makemake images. Carved into solid basalt, they have resisted ages of harsh weather. It has been suggested that the images represent birdman competition winners. Over 480 birdman petroglyphs have been found on the island, mostly around Orongo."&lt;ref name="Mysterious Places 2013"&gt;"Mysterious Places: Explore Sacred Sites and Ancient Civilizations." Mysterious Places: Explore Sacred Sites and Ancient Civilizations. N.p., n.d. Web. 29 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Orongo, the site of the cult's festivities, was a dangerous landscape which consisted of a "narrow ridge between a 1,000 foot drop into the ocean on one side and a deep crater on the other". Considered the sacred spot of Orongo, Mata Ngarau was the location where birdman priests prayed and chanted for a successful egg hunt. "The purpose of the birdman contest was to obtain the first egg of the season from the offshore islet Motu Nui. Contestants descended the sheer cliffs of Orongo and swam to Motu Nui where they awaited the coming of the birds. Having procured an egg, the contestant swam back and presented it to his sponsor, who then was declared birdman for that year, an important status position."&lt;ref&gt;"Easter Island - Moai Statues and Rock Art of Rapa Nui."

===Moai Kavakava===
{{main|Moai kavakava}}
These figures are much smaller than the better-known stone moai. They are made of wood and have a small, slender aspect, giving them a sad appearance. These figures are believed to have been made after the civilization on Rapa Nui began to collapse, which is why they seem to have a more emaciated appearance to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMS 14C age determinations of Rapanui (Easter Island) wood sculpture: moai kavakava ET 48.63 from Brussels|url=https://www.academia.edu/1651548/AMS_14C_age_determinations_of_Rapanui_Easter_Island_wood_sculpture_moai_kavakava_ET_48.63_from_Brussels|accessdate=29 October 2013|author=F.

===1722–1868 Toppling of the Moai===
[[File:Toppled moai.jpg|thumb|Toppled moai]] 
At some point after the 1722 [[Jakob Roggeveen|Roggeveen]] visit, all of the moai that had been erected on ahus were toppled, with the last standing statues reported in 1838 by [[Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars]], and no upright statues by 1868,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Linton Palmer|year=1870|title=A visit to Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, in 1868|journal=Journal of the Royal Geographic Society|volume=40|pages=167–181|doi=10.2307/1798641}}&lt;/ref&gt; apart from the partially buried ones on the outer slopes of Rano Raraku.

Oral histories include one account of a clan pushing down a single moai in the night but others refer to the "earth shaking" and other indications that at least some of them fell down through earthquakes.&lt;ref name="Edmundo Edwards, Raul Marchetti, Leopoldo Dominichetti and Oscar Gonzales-Ferran 1996 1-15"&gt;{{cite news|title=When the Earth Trembled, the Statues Fell|author1=Edmundo Edwards |author2=Raul Marchetti |author3=Leopoldo Dominichetti |author4=Oscar Gonzales-Ferran |journal=Rapa Nui Journal|volume=10|number=1|year=1996|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the moai toppled forward such that their faces were hidden and often fell in such a way that their necks broke; others fell off of the back of their platforms.&lt;ref name="Edmundo Edwards, Raul Marchetti, Leopoldo Dominichetti and Oscar Gonzales-Ferran 1996 1-15"/&gt; Today, about 50 moai have been re-erected on their ahus or at museums elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Terry L. Hunt  |author2=Carl P. Lipo |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Statues That Walked:Unraveling the Mystery of Easter Island|year=2011|publisher=Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rapa Nui people were then devastated by the slave trade that began at the island in 1862. Within only a time span of one year the individuals that remained on the island were sick, injured, and lacking leadership. The survivors of the slave raids had new company from landing missionaries. The society was vulnerable and the converting process of Christianity did not take long. Native Easter Islanders lost their identity as first their style of clothing and soon their tattoos and body paint were banned by the new Christian proscriptions. The history of their ancestors was destroyed: artwork, buildings, sacred objects; leaving little record of the islanders' former lives. They were then subjected to forceful removal from their native lands and made to reside on a much smaller portion of the island while the rest was used for farming.&lt;ref name="Mysterious Places 2013"/&gt; "Eventually all pure Rapa Nui blood died out. Annexation with Chile brought new influences, and today there are only a few individuals left with ties to the original population."&lt;ref name="Mysterious Places 2013"/&gt;{{better source|date=July 2017}}

===Removal===
{{Main|Relocation of moai objects}}
Eleven or more moai have been removed from the island and transported to locations around the world, including six out of the thirteen moai that were carved from basalt.

==Preservation and restoration==
[[File:SignattheMoais.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|It is forbidden for visitors to climb on the moai.]]
From 1955 through 1978, an American archaeologist, [[William Mulloy]], undertook extensive investigation of the production, transportation and erection of Easter Island's [[monument|monumental statuary]]. Mulloy's Rapa Nui projects include the investigation of the [[Ahu Akivi|Akivi-Vaiteka Complex]] and the physical restoration of [[Ahu Akivi]] (1960); the investigation and restoration of [[Ahu Tahai|Ahu Ko Te Riku]] and [[Ahu Tahai|Ahu Vai Uri]] and the [[Ahu Tahai|Tahai Ceremonial Complex]] (1970); the investigation and restoration of two ''ahu'' at [[Hanga Kio'e]] (1972); the investigation and restoration of the ceremonial village at [[Orongo]] (1974) and numerous other archaeological surveys throughout the island.

The [[Rapa Nui National Park]] and the moai are included in the 1972 [[UN]] convention concerning the protection of the world's cultural and natural heritage and consequently on the 1994 list of [[UNESCO]] World Heritage sites.

The moai have been mapped by a number of groups over the years including efforts by [[Father Sebastian Englert]] and Chilean researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cristino, F., C., P. Vargas C., and R.

The purpose of the project is to understand the figures' original use, context, and meaning, with the results being provided to the Rapa Nui families and the island's public agencies that are responsible for conservation and preservation of the moai. Other studies include work by [[Britton Shepardson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Britton Shepardson|year=2010|title=Moai Database - Rapa Nui|url=http://www.terevaka.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Terry L.

In 2008, a Finnish tourist chipped a piece off the ear of one moai. The tourist was fined $17,000 in damages and was banned from the island for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7337927.stm|title=Easter Island fines ear chipper|date=2008-04-09|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080409.wchiletourist0409/BNStory/International/home|title=Tourist chips earlobe off ancient statue on Easter Island|date=2008-04-09|publisher=Globe and Mail|accessdate=2008-09-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413100839/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080409.wchiletourist0409/BNStory/International/home|archivedate=13 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unicode character==
In 2010, Moai was included as an [[emoji]] in Unicode version 6.0 under the code point &lt;code&gt;U+1F5FF&lt;/code&gt; and is represented as such:
:&lt;span style="font-size:1.6em;"&gt;🗿&lt;/span&gt;
In operating systems that did not come with fonts that natively support all codepoints of Unicode 6.0 or greater, the [http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/ Symbola font] by George Douros is available, 'free for any use' as per Douros.

The official unicode name for the emoji is spelled "Moyai". This is the name of a statue near [[Shibuya Station]] in Tokyo, which is inspired by Moai from the Easter Island but looks distinct. This has caused inconsistent drawings to be adopted for this emoji by various companies with proprietary emoji images.&lt;ref&gt;http://emojipedia.org/moyai/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muhammad Saleh Kamboh''' ({{lang-ur|ملا محمد صالح کمبوہ}}) Lahori was a noted calligraphist and official biographer of Emperor [[Shah Jahan]] and the teacher of Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. Though a widely read person,&lt;ref&gt;Hamdard Islamicus, 1978, p 75, Hamdard National Foundation, Pakistan – Islam.&lt;/ref&gt; little is known of the life of Muhammad Saleh Kamboh other than the works he composed. He was son of Mir Abdu-lla, Mushkin Kalam, whose title shows him to also have been a fine writer.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians]]'', 1877, p 123, Henry Miers Elliot, John Dowson; Shah Jahan, 1975, p 131, Henry Miers Elliot – Mogul Empire; ''A Descriptive Catalogue of the Historical Manuscripts in the Arabic and Persian Languages'', 2008, p. 124, [[William Hook Morley]] – History.&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to be younger brother of ''[[Shaikh Inayat Allah Kamboh|Inayat-Allah Kamboh]]'' (Urdu: عنایت خان کمبوہ)&lt;ref name="Shah Jahan 1975, p 131"&gt;Shah Jahan, 1975, p 131, Henry Miers Elliot – Mogul Empire.&lt;/ref&gt; and worked as a ''Shahi Dewan (Minister)'' with the governor of [[Lahore]].

==As a historian and a poet==
Muhammad Saleh is best remembered for his work ''Amal-i Salih'', also referred to as ''Shah Jahan Namah'' (The History of Shah Jahan), which he completed in 1659–60 AD. ''Amal-i-Salih'' is an account of the life and reign of [[Shah Jahan]]. However, the work also includes information on Shah Jahan's predecessors (particularly [[Akbar]] and [[Jahangir]]) and a compendium of biographies of the [[Shaikh]]s, poets, and other notables who were contemporaries with Shah Jahan. It is considered to be one of the most important original sources of events during Shah Jahan's reign.

Muhammad Saleh was known as a poet by the [[Persia]]n title ''Kashfi''  and by [[Hindi]] ''Subhan'' and is also stated to be an accomplished Hindi singer.&lt;ref name="Shah Jahan 1975, p 131"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Persian literature in India during the time of Jahangir and Shah Jahan, 1970, p 171, M.

In the list of ''mansabdars'', Muhammad Saleh Kamboh is put down as a commander of five hundred soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians, 1877, p 123, Henry Miers Elliot, John Dowson; Shah Jahan, 1975, p 131, Henry Miers Elliot – Mogul Empire.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Descriptive Catalogue of the Historical Manuscripts in the Arabic and Persian Languages, 2008, p 124, William Hook Morley – History.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed by some accounts that Muhammad Saleh Kamboh served as a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Admiral]] and unfortunately was killed while fighting alongside his fleet against the [[Ahoms]] at [[Pandu]] on [[Bengal]]-[[Assam]] border while helping General [[Abdus Salam]], the [[Faujdar]] (infantry commander) of [[Hajo]], during the tenure of [[Islam Khan Mashadi]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Governor of [[Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society, 1963, p 349, Pakistan Historical Society; Encyclopaedia of Bangladesh, p 169/170, Nagendra K. Singh; A History of Assam, 1906, pp 110–111, Edward Albert Gait.&lt;/ref&gt; The event referred to above is said to date 1636 AD, which is incorrect, since Muhammadd Saleh was very much alive and is known to have completed his ''Amal-i Salih'' in 1659/60 AD soon after [[Aurangzeb]] (Reign 1658 AD-1707 AD) became the emperor of [[India]] in 1658 AD. According to Naimur Rehman Farooqi, the work was completed in 1669 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Mughal-Ottoman Relations: A Study of Political and Diplomatic Relations Between Mughal India and the Ottoman Empire, 1556–1748, 1986, p 208, Naimur Rahman Farooqi.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also stated that when Shaikh Makhdum was appointed imperial ''"Sadr-us-Sadur"''  (''Chief Sadr'', ''Chief Administrator or Prime Minister'') after death of Sadr Sharif Khan during the reign of [[Aurangzeb]], Muhammad Salih Kamboh was appointed ''Peshdast'' (deputy).&lt;ref&gt;Maāsir-i-ʻālamgiri: A History of the Emperor Aurangzib-ʻĀlamgir (reign 1658–1707 A.D.) of Saqi Mustʻad Khan By Muḥammad Sāqī Mustaʻidd Khān, Jadunath Sarkar, 1981, p 138, Muḥammad Sāqī Mustaʻidd Khān, Jadunath Sarkar – Mogul Empire; Bibliotheca Indica, 1947, p 138, Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Asiatic Society (Calcutta, India), Asiatic Society of Bengal, India Asiatic Society (Calcutta – Indic literature.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
The date of Muhammad Saleh's death is not certain.&lt;ref&gt;The Shah Jahan Nama of 'Inayat Khan: An Abridged History of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, Compiled by His Royal Librarian : the Nineteenth-century Manuscript Translation of A.R. Fuller (British Library, Add. 30,777), 1990, p xxviii, Inayat Khan, Wayne Edison Begley, Z. A. Desai, Ziyaud-Din A. Desai.&lt;/ref&gt; S. M. Latif states on unspecified authority in his works that Muhammad Saleh Kamboh died in A. H. 1085 (1675 AD) &lt;ref&gt;Lahore, its history etc., 1992, S. M. Latif; Quoted in: Islamic Culture, 1941, p 74, Islamic Culture Board.&lt;/ref&gt; which is accepted by some writers.

The '''National Czech &amp; Slovak Museum &amp; Library''' ('''NCSML''') is a [[museum]] and [[library]] of [[Czechs|Czech]] and [[Slovakia|Slovak]] history and culture located in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], in the [[United States]]. Established in 1974, the museum and library moved to its present site in 1983. The museum and library was severely affected by the [[Iowa flood of 2008]]. In 2012, rebuilding and expansion efforts were completed and the NCSML reopened.

==History until the 2008 flood==
In 1974, several second and third-generation [[Czech American]]s in the Cedar Rapids area founded the '''Czech Fine Arts Foundation''' to preserve their Czech heritage and culture. In 1978, the group's growing collection of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and documents caused them to open a Czech Museum in a three-room house, where the museum attracted additional materials and volunteers. In 1981, the collections were moved to a new building on the museum's current site with the goal of permanent public display. In 1983, the group acquired a {{convert|2200|sqft}} 19th-century immigrant home and moved it to its property, where it was restored and furnished in the style of the 1880s and 1890s.&lt;ref name=ncsmlhis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsml.org/Content/About-Us/Museum-History.aspx |title=Museum History |publisher=National Czech &amp; Slovak Museum &amp; Library |accessdate=November 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105015018/http://www.ncsml.org/Content/About-Us/Museum-History.aspx |archivedate=November 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1983 onwards, the museum began to employ staff, and during the 1980s gained additional artifacts and financial contributions from Czech and [[Slovak American]]s. The museum adopted its current name during this period. By the 1990s, the museum and library were outgrowing its space, and plans for a new facility began, with an architect creating plans for a new {{convert|16,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building. Fundraising for the new facility began during this time. On October 28, 1993, [[groundbreaking]] took place for the new building. On October 21, 1995, the building was dedicated, with U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], [[Czech Republic|Czech]] President [[Václav Havel]], and [[Slovakia]]n President [[Michal Kováč]] presiding over the ceremony.&lt;ref name=ncsmlhis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americaslibrary.gov/es/ia/es_ia_czech_1_e.html National Czech and Slovak Museum and Library].

Spectator.sme.sk. Retrieved on 2013-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 1997, the NCSML opened an international exhibit, "A Thousand Years of Czech Culture: Riches from the National Museum in Prague," which centered on artifacts on loan from the [[National Museum (Prague)|National Museum]] in [[Prague]]. The museum stated that the exhibit attracted more than 30,000 visitors from around the U.S. and 22 countries. In 1998, a permanent exhibit, "Homelands: The Story of the Czech and Slovak People," opened. In 1999, the museum hosted its history and culture conference for the first time.&lt;ref name=ncsmlhis/&gt;

In 2000, the museum underwent significant renovations and remodeling, including the addition of secure and [[Climate control|climate-controlled]] storage facilities and a new venue for temporary exhibits, created by dividing the social/rental hall. In the same year, the library's collection doubled with the acquisition of the [[Slavic language]] collection from [[Benedictine University]], and the museum and library began publishing ''[[Slovo (journal)|Slovo]]'', a history and culture [[academic journal]].&lt;ref name=ncsmlhis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsml.org/Content/Education/Publications/Slovo.aspx |title=Slovo |publisher=National Czech &amp; Slovak Museum &amp; Library |accessdate=November 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110055236/http://www.ncsml.org/Content/Education/Publications/Slovo.aspx |archivedate=November 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years, the museum continued to grow its collections, membership, and events schedule. In 2001, the museum began planning to acquire additional property for a research and performing arts center, and began a fundraising campaign to build its [[Financial endowment|endowment]] to $5 million by 2005. The NCSML stated that its membership in 2002 was above 1,900 people. In 2002, the museum and library opened an "Kroje—Dress for the Dance of Life!," an exhibit on [[Kroje]] which ran until January 19, 2003. The museum also hosted the annual meetings of the Czech Glass Collectors Guild and the Czech-Slovak Genealogical Society International during this time.&lt;ref name=ncsmlhis/&gt;

==2008 flood and rebuilding==
During the [[Iowa flood of 2008]], the [[Cedar River (Iowa River)|Cedar River]] overflowed its banks, flooding the museum and library with {{convert|8|ft}} of water and causing severe damage to the exhibitions and contents. The damage was variously valued at $8 million or $9 million.&lt;ref name=kcrgamb&gt;{{cite news |title=Czech Republic Ambassador Visits Cedar Rapids, Presents Donation |author=Mark Geary |url=http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/33549779.html |agency=[[KCRG-TV|KCRG]] |date=October 29, 2008 |accessdate=November 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314154709/http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/33549779.html |archivedate=March 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flood occurred just days before the museum was scheduled to reveal its choice among four proposals for a tripling in the size of the facility.&lt;ref name="spectator.sme.sk"&gt;[http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/32386/18/us_national_czech_and_slovak_museum_wrecked.html US National Czech and Slovak Museum wrecked - The Slovak Spectator]. Spectator.sme.sk. Retrieved on 2013-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Museum staff were able to remove two trucks full of museum and library material before the flood. [[Fine art]] and [[folklore]] artifacts were prioritized for removal.&lt;ref name="spectator.sme.sk"/&gt; Two exhibits were destroyed in the flood, including one about the [[Prague Spring]] in 1968 and the subsequent [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. In the immediate aftermath of the flood, artifacts were removed from the building's upper levels, which were not reached by floodwaters, and flood-damaged items were removed for restoration efforts, with some library books sent to [[Chicago]] to be [[Freeze-drying|freeze-dried]] and restored. The Chicago Conservation Center assisted by providing expert help in efforts to save [[textile]]s and [[linen]]s.&lt;ref name="spectator.sme.sk"/&gt;

At the time of the 2008 flood the museum was visited by about 35,000 people each year, with an annual economic impact of $1 million.&lt;ref name=hadish&gt;{{cite news |title=Czech museum leaders look ahead to new moving date |author=Cindy Hadish |url=http://thegazette.com/2010/12/15/czech-museum-leaders-look-ahead-to-new-moving-date/ |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|Cedar Rapids Gazette]] |date=December 15, 2010 |accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library held an estimated 30,000 Slovak and Slovak-related items in its library, two-thirds of which are stored off-site and were not affected by flood damage. Around 40 percent of the museum's artifacts are Slovak. The museum holds the largest collection of [[kroje]] outside Slovakia and the Czech Republic, with the oldest pieces dating to the 16th century.&lt;ref name="spectator.sme.sk"/&gt;

During the flood the NCSML's entire collection of 5,000 [[phonograph]] [[Gramophone record|records]], documenting 80 years of recorded Czech and Slovak music, were damaged. The [[University of Iowa]] Libraries Preservation Department were able to repair and restore most of the records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsml.org/News/20091223/31/UI-preservationists-restore-Czech-and-Slovak-phonograph-records-after-flood.aspx |title=UI preservationists restore Czech and Slovak phonograph records after flood |date=December 23, 2009 |publisher=National Czech &amp; Slovak Museum &amp; Library |accessdate=November 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322001404/http://www.ncsml.org/News/20091223/31/UI-preservationists-restore-Czech-and-Slovak-phonograph-records-after-flood.aspx |archivedate=March 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Media Advisory: UI preservationists restore Czech, Slovak phonograph records  |url=http://news-releases.uiowa.edu/2009/december/121709czechMA.html |publisher=[[University of Iowa]] |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the flood, a temporary facility was opened at [[Lindale Mall]]. The museum's temporary home was moved in April 2010 to the Kosek Building at 87 Sixteenth Avenue SW in Cedar Rapids, built in 1910. The interim space, including a gallery and museum [[gift shop]], was opened. An exhibition, "Rising Above: The Story of the People and the Flood" also opened at that time. The exhibit focuses on the 2008 flood, comparing it to the previous floods of 1929 and [[Great Mississippi and Missouri Rivers Flood of 1993|1993]], and includes materials from the NCSML's Flood Oral History Project, an [[oral history]] project of the personal accounts of flood victims. The exhibit tells the story of the flood in conjunction with the history of Cedar Rapids, the [[Czech Village]], and New Bohemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsml.org/Exhibition/12/Permanent-Exhibit-Now-Open.aspx |title=Permanent Exhibit Now Open in Kosek Building |publisher=National Czech &amp; Slovak Museum &amp; Library |accessdate=November 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322001332/http://www.ncsml.org/Exhibition/12/Permanent-Exhibit-Now-Open.aspx |archivedate=March 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kosek Building continues to be a part of the Museum and Library after the main building was rebuilt.

The [[Iowa General Assembly]] set aside $10 million to help the museum and library rebuild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Czech &amp; Slovak Museum Kicks Off First Rebuilding Since Flood |author=Dave Franzman |url=http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/52545982.html |agency=[[KCRG-TV|KCRG]] |date=August 5, 2009 |accessdate=November 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314154647/http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/52545982.html |archivedate=March 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008 the Czech ambassador presented a $405,000 donation from the Czech Republic for reconstruction efforts.&lt;ref name=kcrgamb/&gt;

The flood damage caused the museum property to have difficulty obtaining [[Property insurance|insurance]] and exhibitions with materials on loan from other museums because of a fear of another flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=National Czech and Slovak Museum Faces New Challenge |author=Mark Geary |url=http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/37184684.html |agency=[[KCRG-TV|KCRG]] |date=January 6, 2009 |accessdate=November 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314154703/http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/37184684.html |archivedate=March 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum decided to move and expand the museum to higher ground, rather than demolishing the original building, because the cost to move the 15-year-old building was $713,000, compared to an estimated $2 million to demolish and rebuild the structure.&lt;ref name=hadish/&gt; Despite the flood damage, the building remained structurally sound. The museum also stated that it wanted to preserve the original building for its historic value and avoid creating unnecessary [[landfill]] waste.

In [[art history]], "'''Old Master'''" (or "'''old master'''")&lt;ref&gt;The term is spelled either way in the literature. Major UK and US dictionaries, incl. the [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/old_master Oxford Online Dictionaries], [https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=old%20master American Heritage Dictionary], Macmillan, Cambridge, and Random House dictionaries use lowercase; Oxford English Dictionary, Collins, and Merriam-Webster dictionaries also mention the uppercase spelling.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=christies1&gt;[http://www.christies.com/departments/old-master-and-early-british-paintings-70-1.aspx Old Masters Department], Christies.com.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to any [[painting|painter]] of skill who worked in Europe before about 1800, or a painting by such an artist. An "[[old master print]]" is an original [[printmaking|print]] (for example an [[engraving]] or [[etching]]) made by an artist in the same period. The term "old master [[drawing]]" is used in the same way.

In theory, "Old Master" applies only to artists who were fully trained, were [[Master craftsman|Master]]s of their local [[Guild of Saint Luke|artists' guild]], and worked independently, but in practice, paintings produced by pupils or workshops are often included in the scope of the term. Therefore, beyond a certain level of competence, date rather than quality is the criterion for using the term.

==Period covered==
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the term was often understood as having a starting date of perhaps 1450 or 1470; paintings made before that were "primitives", but this distinction is no longer made. The  ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''  defines the term as "A pre-eminent artist of the period before the modern; esp. a pre-eminent western European painter of the 13th to 18th centuries." The first quotation given is from 1696, in the diary of [[John Evelyn]]: "My L: Pembroke..shewed me divers rare Pictures of very many of the old &amp; best Masters, especially that of M: Angelo..,&amp; a large booke of the best drawings of the old Masters."&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"old master, n. and adj." ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, December 2016. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to refer to a painting or sculpture made by an Old Master, a usage datable to 1824.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; There are comparable terms in Dutch, French and German; the Dutch may have been the first to make use of such a term, in the 18th century, when ''oude meester'' mostly meant [[Dutch Golden Age painting|painters of the Dutch Golden Age]] of the previous century. ''Les Maitres d'autrefois'' of 1876 by [[Eugene Fromentin]] may have helped to popularize the concept, although "vieux maitres" is also used in French. The famous collection in [[Dresden]] at the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] is one of the few museums to include the term in its actual name, although many more use it in the title of departments or sections. The collection in the Dresden museum essentially stops at the [[Baroque]] period.

The end date is necessarily vague – for example, [[Goya]] (1746–1828) is certainly an Old Master,&lt;ref name=christies1 /&gt; though he was still painting and [[printmaking]] at his death in 1828. The term might also be used for [[John Constable]]&lt;ref name=christies1 /&gt; (1776–1837) or [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1868), but usually is not.

The term tends to be avoided by [[art historian]]s as too vague, especially when discussing paintings, although the terms "Old Master Prints" and "Old Master drawings" are still used. It remains current in the art trade. Auction houses still usually divide their sales between, for example, "Old Master Paintings", "Nineteenth-century paintings" and "Modern paintings". [[Christie's]] defines the term as ranging "from the 14th to the early 19th century".{{cite quote|date=January 2017}}

==Anonymous artists==
Artists, most often from early periods, whose hand has been identified by art historians, but to whom no identity can be confidently attached, are often given names by art historians such as ''[[Master E.S.]]'' (from his monogram), ''[[Master of Flémalle]]'' (from a previous location of a work), ''Master of [[Mary of Burgundy]]'' (from a patron), ''[[Master of Latin 757]]'' (from the shelf mark of a manuscript he illuminated), ''[[Master of the Brunswick Diptych]]'' or ''[[Master of Schloss Lichtenstein]]''.

It includes language from the UK, the United States, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean, Canada, India, Singapore and South Africa.&lt;ref name=oec/&gt; The text is mainly collected from [[web page]]s; some printed texts, such as academic journals, have been collected to supplement particular subject areas.&lt;ref name=oec/&gt; The sources are writings of all sorts, from "literary novels and specialist journals to everyday newspapers and magazines and from [[Hansard]] to the language of blogs, emails, and social media".&lt;ref name=oec/&gt; This may be contrasted with similar databases that sample only a specific kind of writing.

The '''Oztoticpac Lands Map of Texcoco''' is a pictorial [[Aztec codices|Aztec codex]] on native paper (''amatl'') from [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] ca. 1540.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, John B. in collaboration with Donald Robertson. "A Census of Native Middle American Pictorial Manuscripts". article 23, ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'' Part 3; ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]]''. University of Texas Press 1975, census #246, p. 179.{{ISBN|0-292-70154-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is held by the manuscript division of the [[Library of Congress]], measuring {{convert|76|x|84|cm|in|frac=32|abbr=in}} and now on display in the Library of Congress as part of its permanent exhibition "Exploring the Early Americas".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/exploring-the-early-americas/conflict-and-accommodation.html#obj2. The Oztoticpac Lands Map in the Library of Congress exhibition "Exploring the Early Americas."]&lt;/ref&gt; The contents are both pictorial and alphabetic text in [[Nahuatl]] in red and black ink. The glosses indicate it deals with lands that Texcocan lord [[Ixtlilxochitl I]] may have given to Don [[Carlos Ometochtzin]] Chichimecatecotl of Texcoco, a son of [[Nezahualpilli]], and litigation over the lands' ownership.  Don Carlos was tried and executed by Bishop [[Juan de Zumárraga]] under his inquisitorial powers in 1539.  The Oztoticpac Lands Map was likely created between 1540 and 1544, perhaps commissioned by Antonio Pimentel Tlahuilotzin, governor of Texcoco, as part of an effort to reclaim land held by Don Carlos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wdl.org/en/item/106/ Oztoticpac Lands Map World Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt; The map shows a palace held by Don Carlos in Oztoticpac.  In the schematic [[cadastral]]s of 75 pieces of land, the map shows [[Nahuas|Nahua]] families who farmed the land as well as the measurements of the plots. A number of these properties were rented by tenants with standard glyphic representations of the rents. The names of the pieces of land are indicated with toponymic glyphs.  The Oztoticpac Lands Map has been linked to another indigenous pictorial, the Humboldt Fragment VI held by the Staatsbibliothek of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, John B. in collaboration with Donald Robertson. "A Census of Native Middle American Pictorial Manuscripts". article 23, ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'' Part 3; ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]]''. University of Texas Press 1975, census #150, p. 141.{{ISBN|0-292-70154-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique, interesting, and important feature of the map is depictions of fruit trees, both European and local, many of them grafted. Pears, quince, apple, pomegranates, peaches, and grapevines are shown Income from the sale of fruit would have increased the value of the property. The importation of European fruit trees is part of the [[Columbian Exchange]], but what is especially significant is not only that the trees were integrated into local horticulture, but also that the trees were grafted, a practice to increase the health and yield of the plants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard F. Cline|Cline, Howard F.]], "The Oztoticpac Lands Map of Texcoco 1540." The Quarterly Journal of the Library of Congress 23, no. 2 (1966): 76-115. https://www.jstor.org/stable/29781211.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a lawsuit by one Pedro de Vergara against the Holy Office of the Inquisition over trees owned by the late Don Carlos, who was executed following his Inquisition trial in 1539.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Howard F. "The Oztoticpac Lands Map of Texcoco, 1540," in ''A la Carte: Selected Papers on Maps and Atlases,'' Washington, DC: Library of Congress 1972, pp. 5-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have grappled with the size of plots of land depicted. Cline created a chart with units of measurement, but was cautious about calculating the size of plots, since it was unclear what unit of measure was being used.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "The Oztoticpac Lands Map," 1966, p. 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Others also grappled with the problem of translating Nahua glyphs for units of measure in the OLM to modern measurements to calculate plot size.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hicks, "Mayeque y calpuleque en el sistema de clases del México antiguo." in Pedro Carrasco and Johanna Broda, ''Estratificación social en la Mesoamérica prehispánica'', Mexico: Centro de Investigaciones Superiores. Instituto Nacional  de Antropología e Historia 1976, pp. 67-87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'', Stanford University Press 1992, p. 98, pp. 504-505 n. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, H.R. Harvey published his argument that there were two different units of measurement depicted in the OLM, and made calculations based on his knowledge of Aztec arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Harvey, "The Oztoticpac Lands Map: A Reexamination," in H.R. Harvey, ed. ''Land and Politics in the Valley of Mexico''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1991, pp. 163-186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.R. Harvey and Barbara J. Williams (1980), "Aztec Arithmetic: Positional notation and area calculation." ''Science'' 210: 499-505.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have continued to study the OLM's paleography.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.doaks.org/research/support-for-research/fellowships/reports/2015-2016/kalyuta Anastasia Kalyuta, "Discovering the Mysteries of the 'Oztoticpac Lands Map': Paleography and Translation of Nahua Land Cadastre", Dumbarton Oaks Research Report 2015-2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the OLM and its densely packed information on a relatively small map has prompted scholars from its first discovery to enlarge sections of the map so that the details can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; This is now possible digitally at the Library of Congress website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4414t.ct000317/?r=-0.163,0.114,1.422,0.586,0 Library of Congress, Oztoticpac Lands Map navigable digital image]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library of Congress considers the map one of the gems of its collection and in April 2018 hosted a webinar, now archived along with the transcript, focusing on it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/today/cyberlc/feature_wdesc.php?rec=8304&amp;loclr=blogloc Oztoticpac Lands Map webinar, Library of Congress 11 April 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://stream-media.loc.gov/webcasts/captions/2018/Oztoticpac.txt Transcript of the Library of Congress webinar]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">'''''Pacta sunt servanda''''' ([[Latin]] for "agreements must be kept"&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;), a [[Brocard (law)|brocard]], is a basic principle of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[canon law]], and [[international law]].

In its most common sense, the principle refers to private [[contract]]s, stressing that contained [[clause]]s are [[law]] between the parties, and implies that nonfulfillment of respective obligations is a breach of the pact.
== Civil law ==
In civil law jurisdictions this principle is related to the general principle of correct behavior in commercial practice – including the assumption of ''[[good faith]]'' – is a requirement for the efficacy of the whole system, so the eventual disorder is sometimes punished by the law of some systems even without any direct penalty incurred by any of the parties.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} However, common law jurisdictions usually do not have the principle of good faith in commercial contracts, therefore it is inappropriate to state that pacta sunt servanda includes the principle of good faith.
== International law ==
With reference to international agreements, "every [[treaty]] in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in [[good faith]]."&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], signed at Vienna on May 23, 1969, entered into force on January 27, 1980, art. 26, and the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations or between International Organizations]], signed at Vienna on March 21, 1986, ''not yet entered into force'', art. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pacta sunt servanda'' is related to good faith, while pacta sunt servanda does not equate with good faith {{Clarify|date=March 2018}}. This entitles [[State (polity)|states]] to require that obligations be respected and to rely upon the obligations being respected. This good faith basis of treaties implies that a party to the treaty cannot invoke provisions of its [[Municipal law|municipal (domestic) law]] as justification for a failure to perform. However, with regards to the Vienna Convention and the [[UNIDROIT]] Principles it should be kept in mind that these are heavily influenced by civil law jurisdictions. To derive from these sources that pacta sunt servanda includes the principle of good faith is therefore incorrect.

The only limit to ''pacta sunt servanda'' are the [[peremptory norm]]s of general international law, called ''jus cogens'' (compelling law). The legal principle ''[[clausula rebus sic stantibus]]'', part of [[customary international law]], also allows for treaty obligations to be unfulfilled due to a compelling change in circumstances.

A '''palstave''' is a type of early [[bronze]] [[axe]]. It was common in the middle [[Bronze Age]] in northern, western and south-western Europe. In the technical sense, although precise definitions differ, an axe is generally deemed to be a palstave if it is hafted by means of a forked wooden handle kept in place with high, cast flanges and stop bar. The axe should be much thicker on the blade side of the stop bar than the hafting side (Schmidt and Burgess 1981, 115). In these respects, it is very close, but distinct from, earlier 'flanged axes'. Palstaves were cast in bivalve moulds made of clay, stone or bronze.

[[File:Middle Bronze Age, Palstave (FindID 422831-310817).jpg|left|thumb|A middle [[Bronze Age]] palstave]]
The [[archaeologist]] [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]] (1881, 72) popularized the term 'palstave' in [[English language|English]] following [[Denmark|Danish]] archaeologists who borrowed the term from {{lang-is|paalstab}}. Confusingly, a paalstab is not an axe, but a digging tool. However, the term had become so common with [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Germany|German]] archaeologists that Evans thought it best to follow suit.

A '''preaching cross''' is a [[Christian cross]] sometimes surmounting a [[pulpit]], which is erected outdoors to designate a [[preaching]] place.

In [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]], many free-standing upright crosses – or [[high cross]]es – were erected. Some of these crosses bear figurative or decorative carvings, or inscriptions in [[runes]]. There are surviving free-standing crosses in [[Cornwall]] and [[Wales]], in the island of [[Iona]] and in the [[Hebrides]], as well as those in [[Ireland]]. Other stone crosses are found in [[Lancashire]], [[Cumbria]] and the [[Scottish Borders]], some of these in the [[Anglo-Saxon cross]] making tradition, like the famous [[Ruthwell Cross]]. Whether these were especially associated with preaching is uncertain.  Later [[market cross]]es were generally not, although all sorts of public announcements, no doubt sometimes including preaching, took place beside them.  {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3751">The '''East Asian Studies Department''' at [[Princeton University]] originally began as the '''Department of Oriental Languages and Literature''' (also later known as the '''Department of Oriental Studies''') in 1927. Both the graduate [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Philology]] programs presented an increasing need for an Asian studies curriculum that could not be addressed by these departments. The Department of Oriental Languages and Literature was formed in response to this growing need. In 1937, an undergraduate program also began to take shape, beginning with courses in [[Chinese art]] and Far Eastern politics. World War II hindered the development of the Asian language curriculum until 1956 when [[Frederick W. Mote]], a graduate of the Department of Oriental Studies, began regular work in [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]].

In 1960, the Department of Oriental Languages and Literature expanded to include [[Japanese language]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]] courses.  [[Marius Jansen]] was appointed as the head of the Japanese program.  During this time, an experimental [[Korean culture|Korean]] program was offered, which included studies in language, history, and politics.  However, this program proved unsuccessful, and another Korean program would not be instituted until 1993. In 1969, the Department of Oriental Studies received independent status and was renamed the East Asian Studies Department (the other component forming the [[Princeton University Department of Near Eastern Studies|Department of Near Eastern Studies]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leitch|first=Alexander|title=A Princeton Companion|year=1978|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The East Asian Studies Department cooperates with the [[Princeton University Department of Art and Archaeology|Department of Art and Archaeology]] to offer a doctoral program in Chinese or Japanese art and archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/artandarchaeology/grad/eastasian.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622133503/http://www.princeton.edu/artandarchaeology/grad/eastasian.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean program==
The Korean program officially began offering courses in 1993.  The four courses offered were Elementary Korean I and II and Intermediate Korean I and II. These subjects were taught by Professor Gwee-sook Kim and Professor Bong Choi.  Since then, the [[Korean language]] program has been growing steadily to include a greater diversity of classes for students to choose from.  Since the spring of 2011, students could select from eight courses including Advanced Korean I and II, Contemporary Korean Language and Culture, and 4th year Korean.  The Korean language department welcomes all students who have an interest in Korean language and culture.  Students are placed into the appropriate class based on level of proficiency as determined by placement tests. For those who wish to continue Korean studies in Korea either during the school year or after graduation, there are [[Study abroad in the United States|study abroad]] relationships and scholarships available at the South Korean institutions of [[Yonsei University]], [[Sogang University]], and [[Seoul National University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oberdorfer|first=Don|title=Princeton University: The First 250 Years|year=1995|publisher=Mondadori|location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richmond Boys Choir.jpg|upright|Richmond Boys Choir]]

'''Richmond Boys Choir''' (or '''RBC''') is a non-profit organization whose mission is "building a richer humanity for male youth through personal, academic and musical excellence."  The organization, which has been nationally recognized on numerous occasions, is headquartered in [[Richmond, Virginia]], in the United States. RBC is tax-exempt and remains totally funded by donations, sponsorships and federal and state grants.

==History==
The Richmond Boys Choir was founded in 1996 in Richmond, Virginia, as a collaboration between [[Theatre IV]] and the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys &amp; Girls Club]] of Richmond. In the fall of 1996 the RBC conducted its first citywide auditions. As a result approximately 25 boys were chosen for membership. By 1997 RBC became an independent, non-profit 501(c)3. Before long the choir was recognized by the mayor as "Richmond's Ambassadors' of Song".

==Philosophy==

Mission statement:

Building a richer humanity for male youth through personal, academic and musical excellence.

Core beliefs:

The Richmond Boys Choir seeks to provide a quality alternative for urban youth in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] by creating a positive avenue that cultivates personal development and establishes a foundation of academic and social success.

==Performance awards==

The choir is in its 20th season{{when|date=October 2014}} and regularly performs in the community of Richmond and on tour throughout the United States. Tours have included performances in [[Kansas City, Kansas]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], [[New York City, New York]] and Panama City, Panama, among others. The choir has also appeared on the nationally syndicated program ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]''. In 2007, the choir was named a finalist in the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] ''Coming Up Taller Awards''. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arts.gov/about/NEARTS/18-2007vol4/story.php?id=p16_leading&lt;/ref&gt;  The August 2015 edition of Richmond Magazine names the Richmond Boys Choir the city's best youth choir.

The '''Silesian Walls''' ({{lang-pl|Wały Śląskie}}, {{lang-de|Dreigräben}}) are a line of three (or sometimes fewer) parallel earthen ramparts and ditches that run through [[Lower Silesia]] in [[Poland]], by the towns [[Szprotawa]] and [[Kożuchów]].  The walls are about 2.5 metres tall and, at their widest, 47 metres.  They run for about 30 kilometres. It is hypothesized by [[Maciej Boryna]] of the [[Muzeum Ziemi Szprotawskiej]] that the Silesia Walls were the southwest [[border]] of the [[Duchy of Głogów]] and built in 1413-1467. It is possible that rather than being military in nature the walls were designed as a type of ''[[Landwehr (border)|landwehr]]'' to reduce smuggling.

'''Situational Crisis Communication Theory''' ('''SCCT''', 2007), posited by W. Timothy Coombs is a theory in the field of [[crisis communication]]. It suggests that crisis managers should match strategic crisis responses to the level of crisis responsibility and [[reputation]]al threat posed by a crisis.&lt;ref name="coombs a"&gt;Coombs, W. T. (2007a). Crisis management and communications. Retrieved March 20, 2012 from http://www.instituteforpr.org/topics/crisis-management-and-communications/&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluating the crisis type, crisis history and prior relationship reputation will help crisis managers predict the level of reputational threat of an organization and how that organization’s publics will perceive the crisis and attribute crisis responsibility. Thus SCCT can be applied in an organization's [[crisis management]].

Coombs created his experimentally based SCCT to give communicators scientific evidence to guide their decisions, essentially stating that the actions an organization takes post-crisis depends on the crisis situation. "SCCT identifies how key facets of the crisis situation influence attributions about the crisis and the reputations held by stakeholders. In turn, understanding how stakeholders will respond to the crisis informs the post-crisis communication".&lt;ref name="coombs b"&gt;Coombs, W.T. (2007b). Protecting organization reputations during a crisis: The development and application of situational crisis communication theory. ''Corporate Reputation Review'', 10(3), 163-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coombs would later expand his work with SCCT through reflections of [[meta-analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=6&amp;sid=59897697-78d5-44cb-891d-dedfd9b8dae7@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Reflections on a meta-analysis: Crystallizing thinking about SCCT.: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[empirical evidence]] to support his theory, Coombs&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt; provided a summary of crisis response strategy guidelines for crisis managers, given here in Table 1. SCCT provides crisis managers with an evidence-based guide to assessing and responding to crises, allowing them to make informed, strategic, and beneficial decisions.

| 1.	Informing and adjusting information alone can be enough when crises have minimal attributions of crisis responsibility (victim crises), no history of similar crises and a neutral or positive prior relationship reputation.
|-
| 2.	Victimage can be used as part of the response for workplace violence, product tampering, natural disasters and rumors.

== Theoretical framework ==
The roots for SCCT can be found in [[Attribution Theory]]. Attribution Theory holds that people constantly look to find causes, or make attributions, for different events, especially if those events are particularly negative or unexpected. People will attribute responsibility for the event and react emotionally to that event.&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt; In the case of organizations, attributions of [[causality]] elicit emotional reactions from stakeholders, especially negative emotions if the organization is attributed as the cause for a crisis. These negative emotions, like anger, affect stakeholders’ future interactions with the organization, changing behaviors like purchases and word-of-mouth recommendations. 
 
Attribution Theory provided one of the first links between crisis situations and crisis responses. Attributions of responsibility that shape strategic crisis responses formed the foundation for SCCT. Coombs built upon Attribution Theory, using it as a base to predict the severity of potential reputational harm—or reputational threat—a crisis may bring to an organization and, using that prediction, guide communication response decisions to minimize damage.

Coombs draws on William Benoit's [[image restoration theory]] in his conceptualization of responsibility and reputational threat, stating that perception is fundamental to assessments of both components. If the audience perceives that the organization is at fault, a reputational threat is put into existence and the organization is held responsible.

== Crisis responsibility and reputational threat ==
SCCT suggests that the key to determining the most effective strategic crisis response is understanding the crisis situation and the amount of reputational threat being posed by the crisis. Reputational threat is how much damage a crisis could inflict on an organization if no action is taken to respond to it. Reputational threat is influenced by three elements: (1) initial crisis responsibility, (2) crisis history and (3) prior relational reputation.&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt;

Initial crisis responsibility is how much the organization’s stakeholders attribute the crisis to the organization; how responsible the key publics hold the organization itself for the crisis. In assessing the level of reputational threat facing an organization, crisis managers must first determine the type of crisis facing the organization.

== Types of crises ==
Coombs has identified three "crisis clusters," or types of crises, in his SCCT research: the victim cluster, the accidental cluster, and the intentional cluster.&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt; Table 2 outlines these crisis clusters. In the victim cluster, the organization is not attributed as the cause of the crisis; rather, the organization is viewed as a victim. In the accidental cluster, the organization has been nominally attributed as the cause of the crisis, but the situation is generally viewed by stakeholders as being unintentional or simply accidental. In the intentional cluster, the organization is given all or most of the attributions for the crisis and shoulders the responsibility. In this case the crisis is considered deliberate.

One example where SCCT was used was the lockout that began within the National Hockey League in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=8&amp;sid=59897697-78d5-44cb-891d-dedfd9b8dae7@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Game off!: Understanding newspaper portrayals of the NHL lockout through si...: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once it is determined which type of crisis, or which cluster, the organization’s situation falls under, managers can predict how much attribution will be placed on the organization and how much reputational threat it is facing. In fact, Coombs’ own prior research showed that crisis responsibility and organizational reputation are negatively related.&lt;ref name="c&amp;h96"&gt;Coombs, W. T., &amp; Holladay, S. J. (1996). Communication and attributions in a crisis: An experimental study of crisis communication. ''Journal of Public Relations Research'', 8(4), 279-295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="c&amp;h01"&gt;Coombs, W. T., &amp; Holladay, S. J. (2001). An extended examination of the crisis situation: A fusion of the relational management and symbolic approaches. ''Journal of Public Relations Research'', 13(4), 321-340.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crisis history and relational reputation==
Another element that threatens an organization's reputation is its history of crisis, whether it has faced similar crises in the past. Within this context, how well an organization has treated its stakeholders in the past—its prior relational reputation—also plays a part in assessing reputational threat. These two elements are involved in the second step crisis managers must take in evaluating the reputational threat facing the organization: if either of these elements exist within the organization, it will intensify attributions of the organization and increase the level of reputational threat. If an organization has a history of facing crises or a poor history of dealing with its stakeholders, attributions of crisis responsibility and the level of reputational threat are greater.

Because of crisis responsibility and reputational threat, crises can effect changes in emotions, and as a result, behaviors. If a person perceives an organization to have a high level of crisis responsibility, he or she is more likely to have feelings of anger toward the organization. Conversely, lower levels of crisis responsibility can evoke feelings of sympathy. Both of these feelings can affect the behaviors of the person toward the organization, whether that person will act positively or negatively toward the organization.

== Crisis response strategies ==

Once the levels of crisis responsibility and reputational threat have been determined, SCCT provides crisis managers with a theoretical base to their strategic crisis response. SCCT’s list for responding to crises assumes that the organization has accepted some level of responsibility for the crisis. Coombs found that the primary responses to crises in SCCT form three groups: deny, diminish, and rebuild. The SCCT list of crisis response strategies is shown in Table 3.

Each of these strategies helps the organization get its side of the story into the media. After all how the crisis is framed in the media will determine how the organization’s publics view the situation.&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt; The media’s frames become the stakeholders’ frames. The ''deny'' strategies help establish a crisis frame and sever any perceived connection between the organization and the crisis. If the organization is not involved, or if the crisis is a rumor the organization can dispel, and stakeholders and the media accept that there is no crisis, no reputational harm will be done.

''Diminish'' crisis responses attempt to assure the organization’s publics that the crisis is not as bad as it seems or that the organization had nothing to do with the situation. These strategies help lessen the connection between the organization and the crisis and help the organization’s publics see the crisis in a less negative light. However, these strategies must be reinforced with credible evidence. If conflicting crisis frames are presented in the media, the organization’s publics will adopt whichever frame comes from the most credible source. ''Rebuild'' strategies help change perceptions of an organization during a crisis by offering real or symbolic forms of aid to victims and asking their forgiveness. These strategies attempt to take the focus off the crisis by taking positive action.

A secondary type of responses, ''bolstering'', attempts to increase positive reputational perceptions by presenting "new, positive information about the organization and/or remind[ing] stakeholders of past good works by the organization".&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt; This strategy can bolster goodwill and arouse feelings of sympathy toward the organization, but Coombs warns, should be used to supplement the primary responses, not as replacements.&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt;

SCCT suggests that how an organization communicates with its publics—what it says—will affect its publics’ perceptions of the organization. Those perceptions can shape how an organization’s publics emotionally react to or behave toward to the organization. Therefore, the communication decisions crisis managers make in the wake of a crisis could have great consequences, either positive or negative. It is imperative that crisis managers act strategically to save the organization’s reputation. According to Coombs:&lt;ref name="coombs b"/&gt;
"Crisis response strategies have three objectives relative to protecting reputations: (1) shape attributions of the crisis, (2) change perceptions of the organization in crisis and (3) reduce the negative effect generated by the crisis."

==The History of the Profession==
According to the [[Society for Technical Communication]] (STC), the professions of technical communication and technical writing were first referenced around [[World War II]]&lt;ref&gt;L. Lin. (2017, November). What is technical writing? [Web log post]. Retrieved from http://www.stc-psc.org/what-is-technical-writing/&lt;/ref&gt;, when technical documents became a necessity for military purposes. The job title emerged in the US during World War II&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, F.M. (2001). A brief history of technical communication. In ''STC’s 48th Annual Conference Proceedings'' (pp. 500–504.)Arlington, VA: Society for Technical Communication. &lt;/ref&gt;, although it wasn't until 1951 that the first "Help Wanted: Technical Writer" ad was published.&lt;ref&gt;History of technical writing. [Webpage].Retrieved from http://www.proedit.com/history-of-technical-writing/&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the title "Technical Writer" wasn't added to the US Bureau of Labor Statistic's Occupational Employment Handbook until 2010.&lt;ref&gt; Malone, E. A. (2011). The first wave (1953–1961) of the professionalization movement in technical communication. ''Technical Communication,'' 58(''4''),285-306. Retrieved from https://www.stc.org/techcomm/&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s and 50s, technical communicators and writers were hired to produce documentation for the military, often including detailed instructions on new weaponry. Other technical communicators and writers were involved in developing documentation for new technologies that were developed around this time. According to O'Hara:&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, F.M. (2001). A brief history of technical communication. In ''STC’s 48th Annual Conference Proceedings'' (pp. 500–504.)Arlington, VA: Society for Technical Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|War was the most important driver of scientific and technological advance. The U.S. Army Medical Corps battled malaria in the jungles of Panama, the Chemical Corps pushed chemical advances in explosives and poisonous gases (and defenses against them), the Manhattan District of the Corps of Engineers literally made quantum leaps in the understanding of physics, and the Air Corps pioneered aviation design.}}

In the beginning of the profession, most technical writers worked in an office environment with a team of other writers. Like technical writers today, they conducted primary research and met with subject matter experts to ensure that their information was accurate. During World War II, one of the most important characteristics for technical writers was their ability to follow stringent government specifications for documents.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, F.M. (2001). A brief history of technical communication. In ''STC’s 48th Annual Conference Proceedings'' (pp. 500–504.)Arlington, VA: Society for Technical Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the rise of new technology, such as the computer, allowed technical writers to work in other areas, producing&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, F.M. (2001). A brief history of technical communication. In ''STC’s 48th Annual Conference Proceedings'' (pp. 500–504.)Arlington, VA: Society for Technical Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; "user manuals, quick reference guides, hardware installation manuals, and cheat sheets." During the time period after the war (1953-1961), technical communicators (including technical writers) became interested in "professionalizing" their field&lt;ref&gt;Malone, E. A. (2011). The first wave (1953–1961) of the professionalization movement in technical communication. ''Technical Communication,'' 58(''4''),285-306. Retrieved from https://www.stc.org/techcomm/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Retrieved from https://www.stc.org/techcomm/&lt;/ref&gt;, technical communicators/writers did so by creating professional organizations, cultivating a "specialized body of knowledge" for the profession, imposing ethical standards on technical communicators, initiating a conversation about certifying practitioners in the field, and working to accredit education programs in the field.

The profession has continued to grow-- according to O'Hara, the writing/editing profession, including technical writers, experienced a 22% increase in positions between the years 1994 and 2005. &lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, F.M. (2001). A brief history of technical communication. In ''STC’s 48th Annual Conference Proceedings'' (pp. 500–504.)Arlington, VA: Society for Technical Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern day technical writers work in a variety of contexts. Many technical writers work remotely using [[VPN]] or communicate with their team via online portals such as [[Skype]] or [[Zoom Video Communications|Zoom]]. Other technical writers work in an office, but share content with their team through complex [[content management systems]] that store documents online. Technical writers may work on government reports, internal documentation, instructions for technical equipment, embedded help within software or systems, or other technical documents. As technology continues to advance, the array of possibilities for technical writers will continue to expand. Many technical writers are responsible for creating technical documentation for mobile applications or help documentation built within mobile or web applications. They may be responsible for creating content that will only be viewed on a hand-held device; much of their work will never be published in a printed booklet like technical documentation of the past.

==Skill set==
In addition to solid research, [[copywriting]], language, writing, and revision skills, a technical writer may have skills in:
* [[Business analyst|Business analysis]]
* [[Scripting language|Computer scripting]] 
* [[Content management]]
* [[Illustration]]/[[graphic design]]
* [[Index (publishing)|Indexing]]
* [[Information architecture]]
* [[Information design]]

A technical writer may apply their skills in the production of non-technical content, for example, writing [[High- and low-level|high-level]] consumer information.  Usually, a technical writer is not a [[subject matter expert]] (SME), but interviews SMEs and conducts the research necessary to write and compile technically accurate content. Technical writers complete both primary and secondary research to fully understand the topic. 
{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Characteristics==
Proficient technical writers have the ability to create, assimilate, and convey technical material in a concise and effective manner. They may specialize in a particular area but must have a good understanding of the products they describe.&lt;ref name=whatdoyou/&gt;  For example, [[API writer]]s primarily work on [[Application programming interface|API]] documents, while other technical writers specialize in [[electronic commerce]], manufacturing, scientific, or [[Medical writing|medical]] material.&lt;ref name=whatdoyou&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.org/what-does-a-technical-writer-do.htm What Does a Technical Writer Do?] Wisegeek, Copyright © 2003 - 2013. Retrieved 31 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical writers gather information from many sources. Their information sources are usually scattered throughout an organization, which can range from developers to marketing departments.

According to Markel&lt;ref&gt;Markel, M. (2015). Introduction to technical communication. In ''Technical Communication'' (pp. 7-9). Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's&lt;/ref&gt;, good technical documents are measured by eight characteristics: "honesty, clarity, accuracy, comprehensiveness, accessibility, conciseness, professional appearance, and correctness." Technical writers are focused on using their careful research to create effective documents that meet these eight characteristics.

==Roles and functions==
To create effective technical documentation, the writer must analyze three elements that comprise the rhetorical situation of a particular project: audience, purpose, and context.&lt;ref name=Kostelnick&gt;{{cite book |last = Kostelnick |first = Charles |title = Designing Visual Language |year = 2011 |publisher = Longman |location = New York, NY |isbn = 978-0-205-61640-4 |pages = 3–390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are followed by document design, which determines what the reader sees.

===Audience analysis===
Technical writers strive to simplify complex concepts or processes to maximize reader comprehension. The final goal of a particular document is to help readers find what they need, understand what they find, and use what they understand appropriately.&lt;ref name=Riordan&gt;{{cite book |last = Riordan |first = Daniel |title = Technical Report Writing Today |year = 2005 |publisher = Wadsworth Cengage Learning |location = Boston, MA |isbn = 978-0-618-43389-6 |pages = 1–546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To reach this goal, technical writers must understand how their audiences use and read documentation. An audience analysis at the outset of a document project helps define what an audience for a particular document requires.

When analyzing an audience the technical writer typically asks:&lt;ref name=Riordan /&gt;
* Who is the intended audience?
* What are their demographic characteristics?
* What is the audience’s role?
* How does the reader feel about the subject?
* How does the reader feel about the sender?
* What form does the reader expect?
* What is the audience’s task?
* What is the audience’s knowledge level?
* What factors influence the situation?

Accurate audience analysis provides a set of guidelines that shape document content, design and presentation (online help system, interactive website, manual, etc.), and tone and knowledge level.

===Purpose===
A technical writer analyzes the purpose (or function) of a communication to understand what a document must accomplish.  Determining if a communication aims to persuade readers to “think or act a certain way, enable them to perform a task, help them understand something, change their attitude,”&lt;ref name=Kostelnick /&gt; etc., guides the technical writer on how to format their communication, and the kind of communication they choose (online help system, white paper, proposal, etc.).

===Context===
Context is the physical and temporal circumstances in which readers use communication—for example: at their office desks, in a manufacturing plant, during the slow summer months, or in the middle of a company crisis.&lt;ref name=Kostelnick /&gt;  Understanding the context of a situation tells the technical writer how readers use the communication.  This knowledge significantly influences how the writer formats the communication. For example, if the document is a quick troubleshooting guide to the controls on a small watercraft, the writer may have the pages laminated to increase usable life.

===Document design===
Once the above information has been gathered, the document is designed for optimal readability and usability.  According to one expert, technical writers use six design strategies to plan and create technical communication: arrangement, emphasis, clarity, conciseness, tone, and ethos.&lt;ref name=Kostelnick /&gt;

:'''Arrangement:''' the order and organization of visual elements so that readers can see their structure—how they cohere in groups, how they differ from one another, how they create layers and hierarchies.&lt;ref name=Kostelnick /&gt;  When considering arrangement technical writers look at how to use headings, lists, charts, and images to increase usability.

:'''Emphasis:''' how a document displays important sections through prominence or intensity.&lt;ref name=Kostelnick /&gt;  When considering emphasis technical writers look at how they can show readers important sections, warning, useful tips, etc. through the use of placement, bolding, colour, and type size.
:
:'''Clarity:''' strategies that “help the receiver decode the message, to understand it quickly and completely, and, when necessary, to react without ambivalence.”&lt;ref name=Kostelnick /&gt;  When considering clarity the technical writer strives to reduce visual noise, such as low contrast ratios, overly complex charts or graphs, and illegible font, all of which can hinder reader comprehension.   
:
:'''Conciseness:''' the "visual bulk and intricacy" of the design—for example, the number of headings and lists, lines and boxes, detail of drawings and data displays, size variations, ornateness, and text spacing.&lt;ref name=Kostelnick /&gt;  Technical writers must consider all these design strategies to ensure the audience can easily use the documents.
:
:'''Tone:''' the sound or feel of a document. Document type and audience dictates whether the communication should be formal and professional, or lighthearted and humorous. In addition to language choice, technical writers set the tone of technical communication through the use of spacing, images, typefaces, etc.  
:
:'''Ethos:''' the degree of credibility that visual language achieves in a document.&lt;ref name=Kostelnick /&gt;  Technical writers strive to create professional and error-free documentation to establish credibility with the audience.

==Qualifications==
Technical writers can have various job titles, including ''technical communicator,'' ''information developer'', ''technical content developer'' or ''technical documentation specialist''. In the [[United Kingdom]] and some other countries, a technical writer is often called a ''technical author'' or ''knowledge author''.

Technical writers normally possess a mixture of technical and writing abilities. They typically have a degree or certification in a technical field, but may have one in journalism, business, or other fields.  Many technical writers switch from another field, such as journalism—or a technical field such as engineering or science, often after learning important additional skills through technical communications classes.

==Methodology (document development life cycle)==
To create a technical document, a technical writer must understand the subject, purpose, and audience. They gather information by studying existing material, interviewing SMEs, and often actually using the product. They study the audience to learn their needs and technical understanding level.

A technical publication's development life cycle typically consists of five phases, coordinated with the overall product development plan:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Hackos |first = JoAnn T. |title = Managing Your Documentation Projects |year = 1994 |publisher = Wiley |isbn = 0-471-59099-1 |pages = 630 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Phase 1: Information gathering and planning
* Phase 2: Content specification
* Phase 3: Content development and implementation
* Phase 4: Production
* Phase 5: Evaluation

The document development life cycle typically consists of six phases (This changes organization to organization, how they are following).
# Audience profiling (identify target audience)
# User task analysis (analyse tasks and information based on target audience)
# Information architecture (design based on analysis, how to prepare document)
# Content development (develop/prepare the document)
# Technical and editorial reviews (review with higher level personnel—managers, etc.)
# Formatting and publishing (publish the document).
This is similar to the software development life cycle.

Well-written technical documents usually follow formal standards or guidelines. Technical documentation comes in many styles and formats, depending on the medium and subject area. Printed and online documentation may differ in various ways, but still adhere to largely identical guidelines for prose, information structure, and layout. Usually, technical writers follow formatting conventions described in a standard [[style guide]].  In the US, technical writers typically use [[AP Stylebook| The Associated Press Stylebook]] or [[the Chicago Manual of Style]] (CMS). Many companies have internal corporate style guides that cover specific corporate issues such as logo use, branding, and other aspects of corporate style. The [[Microsoft Manual of Style|Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications]] is typical of these.

Engineering projects, particularly defense or aerospace related projects, often follow national and international documentation standards&amp;mdash;such as ATA100 for civil aircraft or S1000D for civil and defense platforms.

==Environment==
Technical writers often work as part of a writing or project development team. Typically, the writer finishes a draft and passes it to one or more SMEs who conduct a ''technical review'' to verify accuracy and completeness. Another writer or editor may perform an ''editorial review'' that checks conformance to styles, grammar, and readability. This person may request for clarification or make suggestions. In some cases the writer or others test the document on audience members to make ''usability'' improvements. A final production typically follows an inspection checklist to ensure the quality and uniformity of the published product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Tarutz |first = Judith A. |title = Technical Editing |year = 1992 |publisher = Perseus Books |location = New York |isbn = 0-201-56356-8 |pages = 456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career growth==
There is no single standard career path for technical writers, but they may move into project management over other writers. A writer may advance to a senior technical writer position, handling complex projects or a small team of writers and editors. In larger groups, a [[documentation manager]] might handle multiple projects and teams.

Technical writers may also gain expertise in a particular technical domain and branch into related forms, such as software quality analysis or business analysis. A technical writer who becomes a subject matter expert in a field may transition from technical writing to work in that field. Technical writers commonly produce training for the technologies they document—including classroom guides and e-learning—and some transition to specialize as professional trainers and instructional designers.

Technical writers with expertise in writing skills can join printed media or electronic media companies, potentially providing an opportunity to make more money or improved working conditions.

The U.S Department of Labor expects technical writer employment to grow 11 percent from 2016 to 2026, slightly faster than the average for all occupations. They expect job opportunities, especially for applicants with technical skills, to be good. The BLS also noted that the expansion of "scientific and technical products" and the need for technical writers to work in "Web-based product support" will drive increasing demand. &lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, Technical Writers,

The '''Tell Asmar Hoard''' ([[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic I-II]], ca. 2900–2550 BC) are a collection of twelve statues unearthed in 1933 at [[Eshnunna]] (modern Tell Asmar) in the [[Diyala Governorate]] of [[Iraq]]. Despite subsequent finds at this site and others throughout the greater [[Mesopotamian]] area, they remain the definitive example of the abstract style of [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic]] temple sculpture (2900 BC–2350 BC).

== Discovery ==

In the late 1920s antique dealers in [[Baghdad]] were acquiring large quantities of unusual, high quality artifacts from the desert east of the [[Diyala River]], just north of its confluence with the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref name="Karen"&gt;Karen L. Wilson, ''Excavations in the Diyala Region'', in [http://cdm16028.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll10/id/189351 ''Art Of The First Cities: The Third Millennium B.C. from the Mediterranean to the Indus''], ed. Joan Aruz (New York and London: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Yale University Press, 2003), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]] at the [[University of Chicago]] obtained a concession to excavate the area.&lt;ref name="Karen"/&gt; [[James Henry Breasted]] (1865–1935), the founder of the institute, invited the Dutch Archeologist [[Henri Frankfort]] (1897–1954) to lead the expedition. Between 1930 and 1937 Frankfort and his team conducted extensive horizontal and vertical excavations on four mounds: [[Khafajah]], [[Tell Asmar]] (ancient Eshnunna), [[Tell Agrab]], and [[Ishchali]].&lt;ref name="Karen"/&gt; They uncovered temples, palaces, administrative buildings, and houses ranging in date from about 3100 to 1750 B.C. The hundreds of artifacts recovered from the stratified ruins of these ancient civic structures greatly enhanced understanding of Early Dynastic periodization.&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;Jean M. Evans, "The Square Temple at Tell Asmar and the Construction on Early Dynastic Mesopotamia ca. 2900-2350 B.C.E.", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 11 (2007): 600.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most well-known and best preserved objects are the twelve statues known collectively as the Tell Asmar Hoard. The hoard was found during the 1933-34 excavation season at Tell Asmar beneath the floor of a temple dedicated to the god [[Abu (god)|Abu]]. The statues were neatly stacked in an oblong cavity beside an altar in the sanctuary. The careful placement suggests that they were buried intentionally. However, the reason for the burial and person(s) responsible for doing so remains unclear. Frankfort, who wrote extensively on the subject, suggests that a priest periodically buried old or badly damaged statues in order to make room in the temple for their replacements.&lt;ref name="HenriFrankfort"&gt;Henri Frankfort, ''Sculpture of the Third Millennium B.C. from Tell Asmar and Khafãjah" (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1939).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

== The statues ==

The statues of the Tell Asmar Hoard range in height from 21&amp;nbsp;cm (8.2 in.) to 72&amp;nbsp;cm (28.3 in.). Of the twelve statues found ten are male and two are female. Eight of the figures are made from Gypsum, two from limestone, and one (the smallest) from alabaster.&lt;ref name="HenriFrankfort"/&gt;{{rp|57–59}} All the figures, with the exception of one that is kneeling, are rendered in a standing position. Thin circular bases were used as supports and large wedge shaped feet provided the larger statues with added durability. The males wear kilts with a patterned hem that covers the midsection and thighs. Their broad shoulders and thick, circular arms frame the bare chest, which is partially covered by a black, stylized beard. All the males, with the exception of one that is bald and clean shaven, have long hair rendered in two symmetrical halves that frames the smooth surfaces of the cheeks and forehead. The large eyes, which are undoubtedly the most striking stylistic feature that the statues share in common, are made from inlays of white shell and black limestone; one figure has pupils of [[lapis lazuli]].&lt;ref name="HenriFrankfort"/&gt;{{rp|57–59}} These materials are secured to the head with bitumen, which was also used as a pigment to give the beard and hair its characteristic black color. Both the hair and the clothing, though abstracted, accurately reflect [[Sumer]]ian styles of the Early Dynastic period.&lt;ref name="HenriFrankfort"/&gt;{{rp|49–52}}

The hoard was discovered in a temple dedicated to Abu, the ancient Near Eastern god of fertility. Evidence from Early Dynastic ruins at [[Khafajah]] suggests that the statues may have been arranged along the walls of the sanctuary either on the floor or on a low mud brick bench before they were buried.&lt;ref name="HenriFrankfort"/&gt;{{rp|10}} Some of the statues are inscribed on the back and bottom with a name and personalized supplicatory message, while others simply state “one who offers prayers.” These inscriptions indicate that the statues functioned as a surrogate for male and female worshipers who wished to leave their prayers with the god. In the 3rd millennium B.C. the price for a votive statue likely depended on its size, and possibly what stone was used.

Frankfort argued that the largest figure in the hoard is not an effigy of a human worshiper, but rather a representation of the patron deity Abu.&lt;ref name="ThorkildJacobsen"&gt;Thorkild Jacobsen, "God of Worshipper". In ''Essays in Ancient Civilizations Presented to Helene J. Kantor'', (Chicago: Oriental Institute of Chicago, 1989) 125.&lt;/ref&gt; He calls attention to a number of features that set this particular statue apart from the rest including: the size, the unnaturally large eyes, especially the pupils, and the emblematic carving of an eagle with outstretched wings flanked by two recumbent mountain goats carved on the base.&lt;ref name="ThorkildJacobsen"/&gt;

[[Image:Valenki.jpg|thumb|right|Russian valenki]]

'''Valenki''' ({{lang-rus|ва́ленки|p=ˈvalʲɪnkʲɪ}}; [[Grammatical number|sg]] '''valenok''' ({{lang-rus|ва́ленок|p=ˈvalʲɪnək}})) are traditional [[Russia]]n winter footwear, essentially [[felt]] [[boot]]s: the name ''valenok'' literally means "made by [[felt]]ing". Valenki are made of [[wool]] [[felt]]. They are not water-resistant, and are often worn with [[galoshes]] to keep water out and protect the [[Sole (shoe)|soles]] from wear and tear. Valenki were once the footwear of choice for many Russians, but in the second half of the 20th century they lost most of their appeal in cities, due to their association with rustic dress.

==Description==

Valenki (synonymic and semantic related expressions which mean the same – vа́lenukhi (pl.), vа́lezhki, vа́leni, vа́lentsi, kа́tanki) – warm felted highboots made from dried sheep’s wool; they are usually hard by their form, but there are soft types which are made for a corresponding footwear.

Valenki are a kind of traditional Russian footwear which is usually worn for walking on dry snow when the weather is frosty. Valenki wear out most quickly from the bottom and very often are soled with leather or other durable material to prevent this, so they are often worn with [[galoshes]]. Also, to protect from getting wet – they use a rubber sole, and there are valenki with glue-sew and molded soles. Traditionally, valenki come in brown, black, gray and white, but the last few years, consumers have been able to order these boots in a variety of colors (red, blue, purple, green, yellow, orange).

Valenki are included in standard of supplying officers and the ranks of the internal military service of the Russian army with warm clothes and gear.&lt;ref&gt;Russian Federation Government Resolution of 17 July 1995 N 720 "On Approval of the glove providing law for enforcement officers of the Russian Federation and norms of supply of glove property for commanding and enlisted personnel of the Interior of the Russian Federation, with the special title of the internal service&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russie.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Russian soldier on skis wearing valenki boots]]
Valenki stem from the traditional felt boots worn by nomads of the Great Steppe (including Southern [[Rus' (region)|Rus']]), whose history goes back over 1500 years.

However, as it’s supposed, the boots appeared at the beginning of the 18th century.
Valenki became widespread only in the first half of the 19th century, when they started being manufactured by industrial methods. Before this, they were quite expensive and only wealthy people could afford to have them. The increasing complexity of needs, the growing influence of the urban mores to the village caused the change of bast shoes with felt boots, and with it, the broad development of fulling production.

Valenki became less popular in the urban life in recent decades because winters in [[Central Federal District|Central Russia]] turned to be more soft and slushy, and as result – lighter and waterproof footwear gradually won popularity and replaced valenki. Valenki are associated with a traditional rustic style of clothing; in cities they are usually worn by little kids, or they are worn by one and all in a severe [[Russian winter|frost]], when other shoes don’t protect from the cold.

Before the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution]], the production of valenki was concentrated in the Semenov district of [[Nizhny Novgorod]] province, in the [[Kineshma]] District of [[Kostroma Oblast|Kostroma province]], and in the [[Kukmorsky District|Kukmor]] in [[Kazan Governorate|Kazan province]]. In 1900, contemporary jackboot [[fulling]] factories of Russia produced 1.4 million pairs of valenki in the amount of 2.1 million [[ruble]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Statistical Yearbook for 1912, ed. V. Sharago, St. Petersburg, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, a pair of valenki cost 1.5 rubles, in 1912 - 2 rubles, at the end of 1916 the speculative price reached up to 12-18 rubles per pair.

[[File:Murano glassmaker.jpg|thumb|200px|Glassmaker in Murano.]]
'''Venetian glass''' is a type of [[glass]] object made in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], primarily on the island of [[Murano]].  It is world-renowned for being colorful, elaborate, and skillfully made.

Many of the important characteristics of these objects had been developed by the thirteenth century. Toward the end of that century, the centre of the Venetian glass industry moved to [[Murano]].

[[Byzantine glass|Byzantine]] craftsmen played an important role in the development of Venetian glass,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.about-venice-travel-guide.com/arts-and-crafts-in-venice.html "Arts and Crafts in Venice"] About Venice Travel Guide&lt;/ref&gt; an art form for which the city is well known.  When [[Constantinople]] was sacked by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, some fleeing artisans came to Venice{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}. This happened again when the [[Ottomans]] took Constantinople in 1453, supplying Venice with still more glassworkers{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}. By the sixteenth century, Venetian artisans had gained even greater control over the colour and transparency of their glass, and had mastered a variety of decorative techniques.

Despite efforts to keep Venetian glassmaking techniques within Venice, they became known elsewhere, and Venetian-style glassware was produced in other Italian cities and other countries of Europe.

Some of the most important brands of glass in the world today, including Venini,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venini.com/eng/storia.htm] History of Venini&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barovier &amp; Toso]], [[Pauly &amp; C. - Compagnia Venezia Murano|Pauly]] and [[Seguso]],&lt;ref&gt;Carl I. Gable,
''Murano Magic: Complete Guide to Venetian Glass, its History and Artists'' (Schiffer, 2004). {{ISBN|0-7643-1946-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; are still produced in the historical glass factories on Murano. Barovier &amp; Toso is considered to be one of the 100 [[List of oldest companies|oldest companies]] in continuous operation in the world, having been founded in 1295.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barovier.com/s_company/chi_storia.asp] Barovier&amp;Toso - A Time-Honoured Heritage&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Murano Glassmaking==
{{main|Murano glass}}

[[File:Venetian glass.jpg|thumb|Venetian glass in the shop window]]

Murano’s reputation as a centre for glassmaking was born when the [[Venetian Republic]], fearing fire and destruction to the city’s mostly wood buildings, ordered the destruction of all the foundries within the city in 1291.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crouzet-Pavan |first=Elisabeth |translator=Lydia G. Cochrane |title=Venice Triumphant |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=0-8018-8189-7 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Republic ordered the destruction of the foundries, it authorised and encouraged construction outside the city, and by the late 13th century, the glassmaking industry was centred in Murano. Murano glass is still interwoven with Venetian glass.

Murano's glassmakers were soon the island’s most prominent citizens. By the 14th century, glassmakers were allowed to wear swords, enjoyed immunity from prosecution by the Venetian state and found their daughters married into Venice’s most affluent families. Of course there was a catch: Glassmakers were not allowed to leave the Republic. Many craftsmen took this risk, however, and set up glass furnaces in surrounding cities and as far afield as England and the Netherlands.

Murano’s glassmakers held a monopoly on quality glassmaking for centuries, developing or refining many technologies including crystalline [[glass]], [[enameled glass]] (''smalto''), glass with threads of gold (''aventurine''), multicoloured glass (''[[millefiori]]''), [[milk glass]] (''lattimo''), and imitation gemstones made of glass.  Today, the artisans of Murano are still employing these centuries-old techniques, crafting everything from contemporary art glass and glass jewelry to Murano glass chandeliers and wine stoppers.

Today, Murano is home to the ''[[Museo Vetrario]]'' or Glass Museum in the Palazzo Giustinian, which holds displays on the history of glassmaking, as well as glass samples ranging from Egyptian times through the present day.

==The art of glassmaking==
The process of making Murano glass is rather complex. The glass is made from [[silica]], which becomes liquid at high temperatures.  As the glass passes from a [[liquid]] to a [[solid]] state, there is an interval when the glass is soft before it hardens completely.  This is when the glass-master can shape the material.

[[File:Muranobeads.jpg|thumb|Orange Murano beads]]

===Materials===
The other raw materials, called [[ceramic flux]]es or melting agents, allow the glass to soften at lower temperatures.  The more [[sodium oxide]] present in the glass, the slower it solidifies.  This is important for hand-working because it allows the glassmaker more time to shape the material.  The various raw materials an artisan might add to a glass mixture are [[sodium]] (to reduce melting temperature), [[nitrate]] and [[arsenic]] (to eliminate bubbles) and colouring or opacifying substances.

===Colours, techniques and materials===
[[File:Venetian Goblet QM r.jpg|thumb|Venetian artisans use special tools including: borselle (tongs to hand-form the red-hot glass); canna da soffio (a blowing pipe); pontello (an iron rod that helps with adding the finishing touches); scagno (a work bench); and tagianti (glass-cutting clippers)]]

Colours, techniques and materials vary depending upon the look a glassmaker is trying to achieve.  Aquamarine is created through the use of copper and cobalt compounds, whereas ruby red uses a gold solution as a colouring agent. [[Murrine]] technique begins with the layering of coloured liquid glass, which is then stretched into long rods called canes ([[caneworking]]) different color canes are then arranged in a mold to form a design. Then they are heated to fusing temperatures and when fused then pulled (stretched) again like taffy to reduce diameters. Then when cold, these canes are then sliced in cross-section, which show a layered pattern.  The better-known term ''millefiori'' is a way of using lots of sliced murrine that being picked up from the marver by a  gather of hot molten glass. When the amalgam of this type of murrine shows the likeness of many flowers, thus mille (thousand) fiori (flowers). [[Filigree]] (a type of [[caneworking]]), ''incalmo'', [[vitreous enamel|enamel painted]], [[glass engraving]], gold engraving, ''lattimo'', ribbed glass and submersion are just a few of the other techniques a glassmaker can employ many of which have not changed since Roman times (the Romans promoted their glass industry wherever they went).

===Tools===
Murano artisans use the specialised tools of their trade in the making of their glass.  Some of these tools (which under different names have been used by glassblowers since Roman times) include ''borselle'' (tongs or pliers used to hand-form the red-hot glass), ''canna da soffio'' (blowing pipe), ''pontello'' (an iron rod to which the craftsman attaches the glass after blowing to add final touches), ''scagno'' (the glass-master's work bench) and ''tagianti'' (large glass-cutting clippers).

'''Walnut Canyon National Monument''' ([[Hopi language|Hopi]]: '''Wupatupqa''') is a [[United States National Monument]] located about {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of downtown [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], near [[Interstate 40]]. The [[canyon]] rim elevation is {{convert|6690|ft|m|abbr=on}}; the canyon's floor is 350&amp;nbsp;ft lower. A {{convert|0.9|mi|km|abbr=on}} long loop trail descends {{convert|185|ft|m|abbr=on}} into the canyon passing 25 cliff dwelling rooms constructed by the [[Sinagua]], a pre-Columbian cultural group that lived in Walnut Canyon from about 1100 to 1250 CE. Other contemporary habitations of the Sinagua people are preserved in the nearby [[Tuzigoot National Monument|Tuzigoot]] and [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]] national monuments.

==History==
[[File:Walnut canyon cliff dwellings.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cliff dwellings in Walnut Canyon]]
[[File:Map of Walnut Canyon NM.png|thumb|left|200px|Click for larger version of map]]

Sinagua is Spanish for "without water", an acknowledgement that the [[Sinagua]] people were able to live in such a dry region.  By living in such a region the Sinagua became experts at conserving water and dealing with droughts.  The Sinagua were also believed to have been active traders that stretched to the Gulf of Mexico and even as far as Central America. The Sinagua, who inhabited the dwellings in Walnut Canyon, left mysteriously around 1250 CE.  It is thought that the Sinagua left because of fear of neighboring tribes or droughts, but it is not certain.  The Sinagua left over 80 cliff dwellings behind.  The Sinagua built their homes under limestone ledges, deep within the canyon, some time between 1125 and 1250 CE - taking advantage of the natural recesses in the limestone cliff walls which were eroded over millions of years by flowing water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walnut Canyon National Monument|url=http://www.arizona-gallery.com/info/walnutinfo.html|work=Arizona Gallery by Jacquie Lumb|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dwellings themselves were small, but large enough for the inhabitants to cook and sleep.  Most of the cliff dwelling rooms are situated near the loop trail, typically slightly above the trail and immediately outside the loop itself. A typical room might have been the dwelling of a single family, and might measure approximately two meters high by six meters long by three meters deep.  Because of the area's dry climate, the water present in the canyon was essential for its inhabitants over 700 years ago as it is for animal and plant life today.  The plant life is very diverse in Walnut Canyon, with more than 387 different plant species, including the Prickly Pear cactus and the Arizona black walnut.  The biodiversity of the area includes high concentrations of sensitive plant species that probably contributed to the decision made by prehistoric people to settle in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/waca/naturescience/plants.htm "Plants: Trees and Shrubs"], United States National Park Service, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other ruins in the {{convert|20|by|10|mi|km|0|adj=on}} area, but none are publicly accessible. Many more dwellings to be seen up close in the canyon just east of the Monument, although it is illegal to enter the canyon.
[[File:Panorama of the southern cliff dwellings at Walnut Canyon National Monument.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Panorama of the southern cliff dwellings which are inaccessible to visitors]]

Walnut Canyon was proclaimed a national monument on November 30, 1915 by President Woodrow Wilson to preserve the ancient cliff dwellings. It was transferred from the [[United States Forest Service|USDA Forest Service]] to the [[National Park Service]] on August 10, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/waca/historyculture/ |title=History &amp; Culture |work=Walnut Canyon |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the national monument was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966.  At Walnut Canyon, there are trails for tourists to get a close view of the dwellings.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

==Geology==
[[File:Walnut canyon strata.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Geological strata: Kaibab Limestone, Toroweap Formation, and Coconino Sandstone]]
Walnut Canyon lies on the [[Colorado Plateau]] and cuts through the [[Permian]] [[Kaibab Limestone]], which exposes the Toroweap Formation and [[Coconino Sandstone]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, G.E., Billingsley, G.H., Hereford, Richard, Wolfe, E.W., Nealey, L.D. and Sutton, R.L., 1984, Map showing geology, structure, and uranium deposits of the Flagstaff 1 degrees x 2 degrees quadrangle, Arizona: U.S. Geological Survey, Miscellaneous Investigations Series Map I-1446, scale 1:250000.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kaibab formation also forms the rim of the [[Grand Canyon]].  [[Crossbedding]] is present in the Coconino Sandstone.

The Walnut Canyon site contains [[Walnut Creek (Arizona)|Walnut Creek]], which carved a 600 foot deep canyon that flows east.  The creek joins into the Little Colorado River en route to the Grand Canyon.  The creek has also created a varied and abundant array of vegetation.  The shaded, north- facing walls are covered in fir and ponderosa pine trees.  The sunny, south facing slopes have agaves and several species of cactus including opuntia, echnocereus and cholla.  The floor of the canyon is home to several species of walnut trees, for which the canyon is named.

The rocks in the canyon walls are formed of three distinct layers - the  upper third of Walnut Canyon's walls contain [[Kaibab Limestone]] that varies in layers and hardness, where the cliff dwellings are found, which overlies steep, scrub covered slopes of the [[Toroweap Formation]], while the lowest third is the sheer-walled, cross-bedded [[Coconino Sandstone]].  Many layers of the limestone eroded, creating alcoves that the Sinagua Indians used as cave-dwellings.

Today a variety of archeological and natural resources are preserved on approximately 3600 acres.

== Climate ==
Not all of Arizona is warm dry desert. At Walnut Canyon (6690'/2039m above sea level), has snow in winter, hot sun in summer with afternoon thunderstorms, and in the spring, strong gusty winds on the rim and/or in the canyon.  Even though the climate was and still is somewhat harsh, the Sinagua Indians that lived there were able to harvest maize, beans and squash.

== Operating hours and seasons ==
[[File:Walnut Canyon National Monument 2015 112.jpg|thumb|right|The Visitor Center]]
Park entrance road, trails, and Visitor Center are open all year, except December 25. From May until October the monument is open from 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. MST and is open from 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. MST the remainder of the year. Entry to park trails closes 1 hour before the monument closes.

The Walnut Canyon site is near Flagstaff.  It is 7 miles east of I-40 and 3 miles south of exit 204. The park has a museum and a small visitor center atop a cliff.  Many of the ancient dwellings were built around a U-shaped meander in the canyon, where the creek circles around three sides of a high rocky plateau, almost creating an 'island', and this region now forms the central attraction of the national monument.  There are other ruins in the surround area which are not open to the public.  Other dwellings of the Sinagua people can be found in the nearby Tuzigoot and Montezuma Castle monuments.

The [[Old Headquarters]] is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=nrhpinv2&gt;{{cite web|last=Holland|first=F.

{{more citations needed|date=January 2017}}'''Whitewashing''' in beauty is a phenomenon in the intersection of the [[fashion industry]], [[digital photography]], [[mass media]], [[marketing]] and [[advertising]]. It describes a situation in which the skin tone of non-white women (less often of men) – when depicted in magazine covers, advertisements, commercials, music videos, etc. – is, digitally [[retouching|retouched]] or physically modified to appear [[white]]r. Whitewashing can also present itself in the alteration of [[Hair|hair texture]] to resemble [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] beauty ideals of straight hair. Whitewashing can be seen in the form of skin whitening, either digitally or with harmful [[Skin whitening|skin bleaching]] products, or by chemically relaxing textured hair to make it conform to Eurocentric beauty standards. Additionally, [[plastic surgery]] can be used to alter features to make them appear more European, such as [[East Asian blepharoplasty|double eyelid surgery.]]

Whitewashing has been seen for centuries in the [[Whitewashing in media|media]], through film, photography, advertising, etc. Whitewashing in [[Hollywood]] is a prevalent issue, often attributed to the lack of racial diversity in the industry itself. Advertising companies often will airbrush their models to make them appear to have lighter skin, as seen in the [[L'Oréal|L'oreal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;campaign with [[Beyoncé]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/08/advertising.usa|title=L'Oreal accused of 'whitening' Beyoncé Knowles in cosmetics ad|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=2008-08-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Whitewashing can also be seen when a film or television show based on a book or other precedent decides to rewrite a non-white role as white and use a white actor to portray the role. This is not to be confused with [[blackface]], which is when a person who is not Black attempts to portray a darker skin tone with makeup or digital editing. This type of whitewashing is most common in the film industry and has been a problem since the beginning of Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/hollywood-has-whitewashed-asian-stories-decades-year-they-couldn-t-n830241|title=Hollywood has whitewashed Asian stories for decades. This year, they couldn't ignore the backlash.|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; More people of color are being represented in the industry as of late, but whitewashing remains a prevalent issue that can affect self-image of young children whose races have been marginalized in film.'

Cultural whitewashing is also common in the media, in which a culture's traditions are tweaked to satisfy Western stereotypes, such as in the popular film [[Step Up (franchise)|Step Up]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vagabomb.com/Cultural-Appropriation-Whitewashing-Everything-I-Loved-about-Step-up-Suddenly-Seemed-Wrong/|title=Cultural Appropriation &amp; Whitewashing: Everything I Loved about Step up Suddenly Seemed Wrong|last=VagaBomb|date=2017-09-07|work=VagaBomb|access-date=2018-03-30|language=En}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular examples ==

=== Advertising ===
A clear example of beauty whitewashing is a [[L'Oreal]] advertising campaign featuring [[Beyoncé Knowles]] in which her skin was digitally retouched to appear lighter. This brought the corporation under fire for a significant period. Other examples include celebrities [[Halle Berry]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Rihanna]], [[Freida Pinto]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Tyra Banks]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Jennifer Hudson]], [[Gabourey Sidibe]] and [[Queen Latifah]], in which these figures were subjected to skin lightening during the editing stage of promotional photoshoots.

The photo and video-sharing app, [[Snapchat]], also attracted public criticism in 2016 for potential whitewashing in its photo filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/snapchat-filters-flower-crown-beautifying-skin-whiter-lightening-controversy-a7036261.html|title=Snapchat criticised over 'filters' which appear to 'whitewash' users' skin|date=18 May 2016|work=The Independent|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular target of this outcry was the use of words such as "beautify" and "pretty" associated with the skin-lightening filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/snapchat-white-wash/|title=Snapchat accused of whitewashing its users through ‘beautify’ filter|last=Chang|first=Lulu|date=18 May 2016|work=DigitalTrends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
Recently, [[Rupert Sanders]]’ Hollywood rendition of the 1995 Japanese manga film ''[[Ghost in the Shell (2017 film)|Ghost In the Shell]]'' came under scrutiny for casting a white actress ([[Scarlett Johansson]],) to play the Japanese protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/31/here-s-how-ghost-in-the-shell-tries-and-fails-to-atone-for-its-whitewashing|title=Here’s How ‘Ghost in the Shell’ Tries (and Fails) to Atone for Its Whitewashing|last=Leon|first=Melissa|date=2017-03-31|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this wasn't physical whitewashing through skin whitening or hair relaxant, it is still considered whitewashing since a white actress was used instead of a Japanese one and the role was rewritten for a white actress.

In the 2014 film [[Aloha (2015 film)|''Aloha'']], directed by [[Cameron Crowe]], [[Emma Stone]] (a white actress) was cast for the role of Captain Allison Ng, a woman who was partially Hawaiian. Similar to ''[[Ghost in the Shell (2017 film)|Ghost In the Shell]],'' a white actress was used in place of a person of color, effectively whitewashing the role and the film itself.

=== Public Figures ===
Typically, women primarily use products to lighten their skin, but in many cases men also do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=Margaret|title=Buying Racial Capital: Skin-Bleaching and Cosmetic Surgery in a Globalized World|url=https://www.mills.edu/academics/faculty/soc/mhunter/Hunter_Buying%20Racial%20Capital.pdf|website=The Journal of Pan African Studies|publisher= |volume=4|issue=4|year=2011|page=143|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former professional baseball star, [[Sammy Sosa]] admitted to using skin bleaching cream in an interview with "[[Primer Impacto]]" of the Univision Spanish network.&lt;ref name="Sosa: Cream has bleached skin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rojas|first1=Enrique|title=Sosa: Cream has bleached skin|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=4642952|website=ESPN|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sammy Sosa said, "It's a bleaching cream that I apply before going to bed and whitens my skin some… It's a cream that I have, that I use to soften [my skin], but has bleached me some. I'm not racist, I live my life happily." &lt;ref name="Sosa: Cream has bleached skin" /&gt;

== Critique ==
The reasons for altering [[Human skin color|skin tone]] in advertisements are believed to be primarily marketing purposes, more specifically directly appealing to whiter ethnicities, which are generally the strongest [[target group]]s in consumer-driven areas such as [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mire|first=Amina|year=2001|title=Skin-Bleaching: Poison, Beauty, Power and the Politics of the Colour Line|url=http://search.proquest.com/genderwatch/docview/194908202/C3A77B0AF8444C03PQ/5?accountid=7418|journal=Resources for Feminist Research|volume=28.3|pages=13–38|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skin tone manipulation can also reflect the implicit [[Physical attractiveness|beauty standards]] or ideals that the marketers perpetuate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Stevie|last2=DeJong|first2=Penelope|year=2011|title=Ethical Responses To Public Allegations Of Skin Tone Manipulation In Print Advertising: Consumer Indifference Or Consumer Concern?|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=00f70588-2f88-44db-8e39-c64075eb7445%40sessionmgr120&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#db=ufh&amp;AN=67526247|journal=Journal of Promotion Management|volume=17.4|pages=396–406|via=Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete|doi=10.1080/10496491.2011.620485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beauty whitewash is criticized for distorting general perceptions of reality, exuding a twisted sense of beauty, and having a negative influence on women, children, and communities alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Ashley|year=2015|title=Picture [Im]Perfect: Photoshop Redefining Beauty In Cosmetic Advertisements, Giving False Advertising A Run For The Money|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=f9fa4ec1-adeb-4419-8ea1-e19555aa3581%40sessionmgr103&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=108802574&amp;db=a9h|journal=Texas Review Of Entertainment &amp; Sports Law|volume=16.2|pages=87–105|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] ideals are forced upon people of color, creating [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]] within their own communities. Ultimately, whitewashing creates social tension not only between White and non-White communities, but also between groups who resemble the more established beauty standards, such as lighter-skinned African Americans, and the groups who do not, including darker-skinned African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hunter |first=Margaret |title=The Persistent Problem of Colorism: Skin Tone, Status, and Inequality |url=https://www.mills.edu/academics/faculty/soc/mhunter/The%20Persistent%20Problem%20of%20Colorism.pdf |journal=Sociology  Compass |publication-date=2007 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=237–254 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-9020.2007.00006.x |access-date=2016-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305034927/https://www.mills.edu/academics/faculty/soc/mhunter/The%20Persistent%20Problem%20of%20Colorism.pdf# |archive-date=2017-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon can apply to both men and women of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Veras |first=Edlin |title=He's Dark, Dark; Colorism Among African American Men |url=http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1035&amp;context=aas_theses |journal=Georgia State University |publication-date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kai Nelson believes that whitewashing has a negative impact on children in African American communities as well.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Kai|year=2016|title=Where's the Representation? The Impact of White Washing on Black Children|url=http://scholarsarchive.jwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1037&amp;context=ac_symposium|journal=Academic Symposium of Undergraduate Scholarship|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media does not always give an accurate view of the races that they are depicting, resulting in a diminishment of self-confidence in African American children. Nelson explains that children interpret the altering of [[Human skin color|skin color]] in the beauty industry in a negative way, and can develop a viewpoint that they are "unattractive" and "undesirable".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of the lack of Black role models in [[Media culture|popular media]], this causes them to see the Caucasian community as the "default [[race (human categorization)|race]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As Ronald Hall describes in his ''[[Journal of Black Studies]]'', whitewashing has caused [[people of color]] to develop a "bleaching syndrome" which causes an internalization of preference for the dominant, or White, culture’s ideals. This results in people of color developing a contempt for dark skin because it is regarded as an obstacle for [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. However, despite adopting white cultural values, people of color are still barred from full assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Ronald|year=1995|title=The Bleaching Syndrome: African Americans' Response to Cultural Domination Vis-a-Vis Skin Color|url=|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=26.2|pages=172–84|doi=10.1177/002193479502600205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[file:1984 WAVE demonstration at MoMA.jpeg|thumb|1984 W.A.V.E. Demonstration at MoMA, Photography by Clarissa Sligh]] --&gt;

'''The Women's Artists Visibility Event (W.A.V.E.)''' also known as Let MOMA Know, was a demonstration held on June 14, 1984 to protest the lack of women artists represented in [[Museum of Modern Art|The Museum of Modern Art]]'s re-opening exhibition "An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Women March on MOMA|last=Lubell|first=Ellen|date=June 19, 1984|work=Village Voice|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition, which included 165 artists, had 14 women among them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Women Artists Picket MOMA|last=Shepard|first=Joan|date=June 15, 1984|work=New York Daily News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945948899|title=Openings : a memoir from the women's art movement, New York City 1970-1992|last=Sabra,|first=Moore,|isbn=9781613320181|edition= First|location=New York, NY|oclc=945948899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Event ==
The event's acronym, W.A.V.E., is a nod to [[Flag Day]], which is observed on June 14 in the [[United States]]. 400 demonstrators, wearing [[suffragette]] yellow and white, marched in front the entrance to MoMA's newly expanded 53rd street building; a well received renovation that doubled its gallery space and increased traffic to the museum.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voices.revealdigital.com/cgi-bin/independentvoices?a=d&amp;d=DFDEGHA19840601&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN---------------1|title=WOMEN ARTISTS NEWS Summer 1984 — Independent Voices|website=voices.revealdigital.com|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pcparch.com/project/museum-of-modern-art|title=Museum of Modern Art Expansion|website=Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects|language=en|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/15/magazine/the-new-moma.html|title=THE NEW MOMA|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|date=1984-04-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-29|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Demonstrators had three demands: that MoMA exhibit works by women artists from their permanent collection, that it display women's work in loaned exhibitions, and that it create a policy to acquire women's work in the future.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The WCA created pins to parody MoMA's "Museum of Modern Art OPENS" staff badges, upon which they included the addition "But Not to Women Artists." Cards were distributed listing the names of 100 well known female artists who were not featured in the exhibit, including [[Alice Neel]], [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Jaune Quick–to–See Smith|Jaune Quick-to-See Smith]], [[Faith Ringgold]] and [[Louise Bourgeois]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One spokesperson for the museum, Louisa Kreisberg, noted that a film series in the exhibition featured four women of the six films shown, and that the staff at the museum was roughly 65% female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Protest at the Modern For More Women's Art|last=Anderson|first=Susan Heller|date=June 15, 1984|work=New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizers ==
The event was organized by the New York chapter of the [[Women's Caucus for Art]] (WCA), and supported by three additional feminist arts organizations; The [[Heresies Collective]], [[Women's Interart Center]], and [[New York Feminist Art Institute]]. Individual organizers for the event were artists [[Sabra Moore]], and [[Betsy Damon]] and curator and President of WCA New York, [[Annie Shaver-Crandell]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
