      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2461">The '''AIM Multiuser Benchmark''', also called the AIM Benchmark Suite VII or AIM7, is a job throughput benchmark widely used by [[UNIX]] computer system vendors.  Current research operating systems such as [[K42]] use

&lt;ref&gt;
[http://re-aim-7.sourceforge.net/ Reaim source download]
&lt;/ref&gt; form of the benchmark for performance analysis.
The AIM7 benchmark measures some of the same things as the [[Sdet|SDET]] benchmark.

The original code was developed by Gene Dronek for AIM Technology, Inc., who licensed it to others.  The first AIM Benchmarks were for single user PCs. The suite was expanded and enhanced to become multi-user benchmarks by Donald Steiny.  [[SCO Group|Caldera International, Inc.]], bought the license and released
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/aimbench SourceForge download page for original AIM7 source]
&lt;/ref&gt; the source code for Suite VII and Suite IX under the [[GPL]].

AIM7 is a program written in [[C (programming language)|C]] that forks many processes called tasks, each of which concurrently runs in random order a set of subtests called jobs.  There are 53 kinds of jobs, each of which exercises a different aspect of the operating system, such as disk-file operations, process creation, user virtual memory operations, pipe I/O, and compute-bound arithmetic loops
.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

An AIM7 benchmark run is composed of a sequence of subruns with the number of tasks incrementing by one between each subrun.  Each subrun goes until each of its tasks has completed its set of jobs.  Each subrun reports a metric of jobs completed per minute, with the final report for the overall benchmark being a table of that throughput metric versus number of tasks.  A given system will have a peak number of tasks N at which the jobs per minute is maximized.  Either N or the value of the jobs per minute at N is typically used as the metric of interest.

The '''Atlanta Life Financial Group''' was founded by [[Alonzo Herndon]] in Atlanta, Georgia. Born into slavery, he started in Atlanta as a young barber, eventually owning three shops. He became [[Atlanta]]'s richest [[African American]] and a highly successful businessman. For many years, the life insurance company was one of the most prominent [[African-American businesses]] in the United States. The demolished public housing project [[Demolished public housing projects in Atlanta#Herndon Homes|Herndon Homes]] was named for Herndon. 

In 1905 Herndon purchased The Atlanta Benevolent and Protective Association (later called Atlanta Mutual) for $140, depositing $5000 with the state under their requirement for a kind of guarantee fund. In 1922 this was renamed the Atlanta Life Insurance Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantalife.com/main.asp?urh=chronology Atlanta Life Financial Group] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831143750/http://www.atlantalife.com/main.asp?urh=chronology |date=August 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Herndon expanded the company with branches in numerous other Southern states.

The Atlanta Life Insurance Company building (built 1920) at 148 Auburn Avenue, near the corner of [[Piedmont Avenue (Atlanta)|Piedmont Avenue]], is part of the [[National Park Service]]'s [[Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site|Martin Luther King, Jr., Preservation District]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.nps.gov/print.html?&amp;alpha=malu&amp;lat=0.14208984375&amp;lng=0.3056640625&amp;zoom=2 Official [[National Park Service]] Map of Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site &amp; Preservation District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821053255/http://maps.nps.gov/print.html?&amp;alpha=malu&amp;lat=0.14208984375&amp;lng=0.3056640625&amp;zoom=2 |date=2014-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''attending physician statement''' (APS) is a report by a [[physician]], [[hospital]] or [[medical facility]] who has treated, or who is currently [[medical treatment|treating]], a person seeking [[insurance]]. In traditional [[underwriting]], an APS is one of the most frequently ordered additional sources of medical background information. The APS is one of the more expensive underwriting requirements, as well as the most time consuming. It is usually completed only when a doctor has free time, as their primary focus is caring for patients. The [[underwriting cycle]] time is often severely hampered by the APS as it could take weeks or even months to obtain. Once obtained, it can be laborious to review and summarize as APS reports can be large documents containing an indepth [[medical history]] information which may or may not be relevant.

==Overview==
In structured underwriting the data capture process with the proposed insured is asked very detailed questions to attempt to reduce the number of [[attending physician]]'s statements necessary. However, many [[medical condition]]s require supporting evidence from the physician. This is where an APS Summary can assist the underwriter in evaluating the proposed insured's medical risk(s).  The APS summaries however, are only as good as the underwriter's experience which varies widely from person to person.  Additionally, APS summaries when processed without a “template structure” guiding the information gathered from the APS often yield inconsistent or miss critical underwriting information. Either inconsistent or missing underwriting information will compromise the [[risk analysis]] process.

By leveraging a seasoned underwriter's knowledge and experiences, scripts can be built that ensure the appropriate medical information is captured and recorded from the APS document.  This is done by creating scripts that prompt the person summarizing the APS to enter all pertinent specific medical condition uncovered.

'''Elisabeth A. "Betsy" Gotbaum''' ([[Given name|née]] '''Flower'''; born June 11, 1938&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/KK4C-HT6 Date of birth], familysearch.org; accessed August 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;) was the [[New York City Public Advocate]]. She was elected as Public Advocate for [[New York City]] in 2001, and reelected in 2005. She was the third woman elected to a citywide post in NYC history. The other two were [[Carol Bellamy]], who served as City Council President from 1978-1985, and [[Elizabeth Holtzman]], who served as Comptroller from 1990-1993. She is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].

==Early life==
Elisabeth "Betsy" Flower attended [[The Brearley School]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20040216&amp;slug=kinderfees16 Betsy Gotbaum profile], community.seattletimes.nwsource.com, February 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated from the Masters School in [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]] in 1956. She attended [[Connecticut College]] for two years, followed by [[Barnard College]]. She earned her B.A. from [[George Washington University]] in 1961. After graduation, she moved to [[Recife, Brazil]], where she taught high school English and mastered Spanish and Portuguese. She returned to New York several years later and earned a master's degree in Education from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]].

==Political career==
Gotbaum became involved in civic affairs in the 1970s, while serving on the staff of former Mayor [[John Lindsay]] as District Manager for the Chelsea-Clinton (Manhattan West) Neighborhood, Assistant for Women's Issues, and Assistant for Education. She continued her work in education with Mayor [[Abraham Beame]], managing a training program for school security officers. In the late 1970s, she was recruited to run the [[New York Police Foundation]]. At the Police Foundation, she developed an innovative citywide health screening and work-site hypertension program with the [[New York City Police Department]] and facilitated an intensive training program for [[9-1-1|911]] operators. She created a program engaging New York City in a campaign to purchase [[bulletproof vests]] for every police officer. In 1990 newly elected Mayor [[David Dinkins]] appointed her the first female Commissioner of the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]. Gotbaum created a toll-free Parks hotline and successfully argued for a change in city policy allowing [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] (GMHC) and other organizations use of [[Central Park]] for fundraising events. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

After leaving the Parks Department in 1994, Gotbaum became President of the [[New-York Historical Society]], a position she held until launching her campaign for Public Advocate in 2001. When she took over, the Historical Society was closed to the public and on the verge of bankruptcy after years of mismanagement. Gotbaum rescued the institution from financial collapse, renovated its landmark building, and recalled its collections from various warehouses. In November 2000, she opened the Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture. She instituted exhibitions, education and public programs for a diverse and ever-increasing audience, leaving the society with a $33 million endowment. Gotbaum resigned from the Historical Society to run for the Office of the Public Advocate. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==2001 Race for Public Advocate==
In 2001, Gotbaum finished first in the Democratic primary and then defeated [[Norman Siegel]] in the Democratic runoff. She was unopposed in the general election. As Public Advocate she focused on education policy, along with women's issues, child welfare, affordable housing and senior services. She was known to work with Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] on certain issues, but she battled Bloomberg on mayoral succession issues. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In return, Bloomberg sought to eliminate the office altogether in 2002 and reduced its budget. At the request of the [[New York State Legislature]], Gotbaum created a Commission on School Governance to examine mayoral control before it expires in 2009. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==2005 Race for Public Advocate==
In the September 13, 2005 Democratic primary, Gotbaum beat civil rights advocate [[Norman Siegel]], and real estate broker Michael Brown came in third with fifteen percent of NYC's vote. She was unopposed in the general election. She took the oath of office for a second term on January 1, 2006. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==2009 Race for Public Advocate==
Despite the [[New York City mayoral elections#Terms and term limits (since 1834)|extension of New York City term limits]], which made Gotbaum eligible for a third term, she decided not to [[New York City Public Advocate election, 2009|run for reelection]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/nyregion/28advocate.html Gotbaum declines to run for a third term], ''The New York Times'', October 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 Appearance in ''The Lottery'' docudrama==
Gotbaum was featured in this docudrama directed by Madeleine Sackler, in which she shared some of her views:
* Against charter schools — Charter schools are not the answer, poverty is the problem in the New York Education system
* Pro-teachers' unions — ''"I think the union is a force in New York City as well it should be. I think the union is here to stay I don't think it’s going anywhere. And I think to think that you can get rid of it is a mistake."'' {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Personal life==
Her husband, [[Victor Gotbaum]] (1921-2015) was a retired New York City labor leader who served for 22 years as president of [[AFSCME]] District Council 37, New York's largest public employee union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/betsy-gotbaum-daughter-in-law-dies-phoenix-airport-article-1.242323#ixzz0Y2xh4d2e Profile], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; She has a daughter from her first marriage.&lt;!-- anyone know her daughter's name --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bellush and Bellush, ''Union Power and New York: Victor Gotbaum and District Council 37'' (1984)&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2007, her stepdaughter-in-law, [[Carol Gotbaum]], died in custody shortly after she was arrested at [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]], after getting into a confrontation with gate crews who refused to allow her to board a plane to [[Tucson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/09/29/2007-09-29_betsy_gotbaums_daughterinlaw_dies_in_pho.html ''New York Daily News'' coverage of death of Carol Gotbaum]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, the family filed [http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/city_room/20080508gotbaumsuit.pdf a lawsuit] against the [[Phoenix, Arizona|City of Phoenix]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/08/gotbaums-sue-phoenix-over-airport-death Gotbaum family sue the City of Phoenix, Arizona over death of Carol Gotbaum]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparisons between the Roman and Han empires''' are the [[Historical comparative research|comparative]] study of the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Han dynasty]] of [[Early Imperial China|early imperial China]]. At their peaks, both states controlled a large portion of the world population and produced political and cultural legacies that endure to the modern era; comparative studies largely focus on their similar scale at their pinnacles and on parallels in their rise and decline. The vast majority of studies focus on [[Early Imperial China|one]] or [[Ancient Rome|the other]]; however, the comparison of the two has enjoyed somewhat increased interest in the 21st century with several studies examining the concepts of ethnicity, identity, and views of foreigners.

== History ==
[[Walter Scheidel]] reviewed the previous scholarship when he explained the purpose of [[Stanford University]]'s Ancient Chinese and Mediterranean Empires Comparative History Project and the framework of its study in the early 21st century. [[Max Weber]] and [[Karl August Wittfogel]] both wrote works comparing the ancient Mediterranean and China; however, their studies have had little influence on later ancient historians. Scheidel gives this as a contributing cause to the relative paucity of comparative studies between the two. The majority of the research in the subject area has concentrated on looking at the intellectual and philosophical history of each society. He also noted a change in the direction of research in the 2000s, with a refocusing on the "nature of moral, historical, and scientific thought" in [[Ancient Greece]] and China.&lt;ref name="ACME"&gt;{{citation |last = Scheidel |first = Walter |url = http://www.stanford.edu/~scheidel/acme.htm |title = The Stanford Ancient Chinese and Mediterranean Empires Comparative History Project (ACME) |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate = 2009-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scholars have made comparative studies of the two empires. As historian Samuel Adshead puts it, "Other comparisons could be made&amp;nbsp;... None, however, offers so close a parallel with Han China as the Roman empire".&lt;ref name="Adshead 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Adshead|2000|p=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have tended to focus on the philosophical and intellectual histories of China and the Greco-Roman world, and despite modern interest, gaps remain in the scholarship comparing Rome and the Han Empire. Scheidel notes that there are no comparative studies of [[high culture]]; there is also a virtual absence of work on  "political, social, economic or legal history" of the Greco-Roman world and ancient China.&lt;ref name="ACME" /&gt; However, he does note that Adshead does briefly address the issue. Wittfogel's work has come in for criticism by later historians, but his studies have not fully been supplanted by up to date theses. In modern studies of [[imperialism]], ancient China has generally been overlooked. In Scheidel's words, "[compared to the study of Europe and China in the early modern period] the comparative history of the largest agrarian empires of antiquity has attracted no attention at all. This deficit is only explicable with reference to academic specialization and language barriers".&lt;ref name="ACME" /&gt;

The emergence of the United States of America as effectively the only [[superpower]] in the world after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in the late 20th century led to a renewed interest in empires and their study. For instance, the Roman Empire has occasionally been held up as a model for American dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mutschler|Mittag|2008|p=xiii.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States' [[hegemony]] is unprecedented in the modern system and thus the only illuminating cases can be found in pre-modern systems: “One difficulty with analyzing unipolarity is that we have mainly the current case, although examining the Roman and ancient China could be illuminating.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Jervis]], “Unipolarity: A Structural Perspective,” ''World Politics'', 61/1, (2009): p 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, with the rise of the American primacy the study of historical empires, such as Han China and Rome, increased. In the field of comparative studies between empires, not just Rome and China, [[Shmuel Eisenstadt]]'s ''The Political System of Empires'' (1963) has been described as influential as it pioneered the comparative approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mutschler|Mittag|2008|p=xiii&amp;ndash;xiv.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of comparing the Roman and Han empires is aided by the amount of written evidence from both, as well as other artefactual sources.&lt;ref name="M&amp;M xiv"&gt;{{harvnb|Mutschler|Mittag|2008|p=xiv.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Fritz-Heiner Mutschler and Achim Mittag, "Comparing the Roman and Chinese empires contributes not only to understanding the trajectories along which the two civilizations developed, but also to heightening our awareness of possible analogies between the present and the past, be it with regard to America or China."&lt;ref name="M&amp;M xiv"/&gt; Recent work by Ronald A. Edwards shows how such comparisons can be helpful in understanding ancient Chinese and Roman political institutions.&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society===
Principles of [[sociology|sociological examination]] have been identified that can be applied to the study of China and Rome. They draw on analytical and illustrative comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonnell|1980}} in {{citation |last=Scheidel |first=Walter |url=http://www.stanford.edu/~scheidel/acme.htm |title=The Stanford Ancient Chinese and Mediterranean Empires Comparative History Project (ACME) |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political structure===
One of the most appealing reasons for historians to begin comparing China and Rome, is their ascent to political hegemony over the Mediterranean and East Asia. However, political comparisons by Adshead have received negative response from Chinese history experts; citing his lack of use of Chinese sources, poor support of his arguments and an eagerness to take poorly supported points as facts.&lt;ref name="jenner"&gt;{{cite journal |first = William John Francis |last = Jenner |title = Review: China in World History |journal = The China Quarterly | number = 121 |date = March 1990 |page = 151 |jstor = 654084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Farmer&gt;{{cite journal |first = Edward |last = Farmer |journal = The Journal of Asian Studies |jstor = 2058649 |number = 3| volume = 48 |date = August 1989 |pages = 583–584 |title = Review: China in World History |doi = 10.2307/2058649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless more recently, China scholars have been engaging in comparative work on political institutions between China and Rome&amp;nbsp;– see work by Ronald A. Edwards&lt;ref name="Edwards 2009" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and between China the early modern Europe&amp;nbsp;– see work by Victoria Tin-bor Hui.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hui|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==
According to Adshead's book ''China in World History'', comparing Han China and the Roman Empire gives context and assists understanding of China's interactions and relations with other civilisations of [[Ancient history|Antiquity]]. In his China and the Roman Empire before [[Constantine I|Constantine]], their "differences outweighed the similarities".&lt;ref name="Adshead 4"/&gt; In the opinion of Scheidel:

{{quote|only comparisons with other civilizations make it possible to distinguish common features from culturally specific or unique characteristics and developments, help us identify variables that were critical to particular historical outcomes and allow us to assess the nature of any given ancient state or society within the wider context of premodern world history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scheidel|2009|p=5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:ChrisCox.jpg|right|thumb|120px|U.S. Representative Chris Cox (Republican-California) chaired the Committee that produced the report.]]

The '''Report of the Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China''', commonly known as the '''Cox Report''' after [[United States Representative|Representative]] [[Christopher Cox]], is a [[Classified information|classified]] [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] [[document]] reporting on the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[covert]] operations within the [[United States]] during the 1980s and 1990s.

==Committee created by the U.S. House of Representatives==
The report was the work product of the Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China. This special committee, created by a 409–10 vote of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] on June 18, 1998, was tasked with the responsibility of investigating whether technology or information was transferred to the People's Republic of China that may have contributed to the enhancement of the nuclear-armed [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] or to the manufacture of [[weapons of mass destruction]].

A similar investigation had already begun in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] under the leadership of [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Fred Dalton Thompson|Fred Thompson]] (Republican-[[Tennessee]]). Thompson had opened his hearings on China's influence in America's 1996 presidential and congressional elections 11 months earlier (on July 8, 1997).

The [[Chairperson|Chairman]] of the Committee was [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Rep. [[Christopher Cox]] of [[California]], whose name became synonymous with the committee's final report. Four other Republicans and Democrats served on the panel, including Representative [[Norm Dicks]], who served as the [[Ranking member|ranking]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member. The committee's final report was approved unanimously by all 9 members. The [[redaction|redacted]] version of the report was released to the public May 25, 1999.

==Major allegations==
The Cox Report&lt;ref&gt;http://www.house.gov/coxreport/chapfs/app.html&lt;/ref&gt; contained five major allegations about China and nuclear weapons.
* China stole design information regarding the United States' seven most advanced thermonuclear weapons.
* These stolen secrets enabled the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] to accelerate the design, development and testing of its own nuclear weapons.
* China's next generation of nuclear weapons would contain elements of stolen U.S. design information and would be comparable in effectiveness to the weapons used by the United States.
* Small warheads based on stolen U.S. information could be ready for deployment in 2002 also enabling China to integrate [[MIRV]] technology on its next generation of missiles.
* These thefts were not isolated incidents, but rather the results of decades of intelligence operations against U.S. weapons laboratories conducted by the [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]]. In addition, the report described the illegal activity likely persisted despite new security measures implemented as a result of the scandal.

While several groups, including the People's Republic of China, contend that the Report is overstated or inaccurate, its authors and supporters maintain that its gist is undeniable. The report's basic findings were as follows, quoted from the above document's opening summary:

{{quote|The People's Republic of China (PRC) has stolen design information on the United States' most advanced thermonuclear weapons. The Select Committee judges that the PRC's next generation of thermonuclear weapons, currently under development, will exploit elements of stolen U.S. design information. PRC penetration of our national nuclear weapons laboratories spans at least the past several decades and almost certainly continues today.

The PRC has stolen or otherwise illegally obtained U.S. missile and space technology that improves PRC military and intelligence capabilities.}}

==Reactions==

===U.S. Government===
The Cox Report's release prompted major [[legislation|legislative]] and [[Administration (government)|administrative]] reforms.  More than two dozen of the Select Committee's recommendations were enacted into law, including the creation of a new [[United States National Nuclear Security Administration|National Nuclear Security Administration]] to take over the nuclear weapons security responsibilities of the [[United States Department of Energy]].  At the same time, no person has ever been [[conviction (law)|convicted]] of providing nuclear information to the PRC, and the one case that was brought in connection to these charges, that of [[Wen Ho Lee]], fell apart.&lt;ref name="WHL"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2000/09/28/wen-ho-lee-to-be-released/|title=Wen Ho Lee to Be Released|author=Sam Chu Lin|publisher=[[AsianWeek]]|date=2000-09-28|accessdate=2009-07-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604182655/http://www.asianweek.com/2000/09/28/wen-ho-lee-to-be-released/|archivedate=2011-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the allegations contained in the report, the [[CIA]] appointed retired U.S. Navy Admiral [[David Jeremiah]] to review and assess the report's findings. In April 1999, Admiral Jeremiah released a report backing up the Cox Report's main allegation that stolen information had been used to develop or modernize Chinese missiles and/or warheads.&lt;ref name=jeremiah&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/news/dci042199.html "DCI Statement on Damage Assessment"], Central Intelligence Agency, April 21, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===PRC Government===
The [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] called all allegations "groundless".&lt;ref name=response&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/325633.stm "China rejects nuclear spying charge"], [[BBC]], April 22, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
[[Richard L. Garwin]] remarked that stolen information regarding the W-70 and W-88 warhead would not appear to directly impair U.S. national security since to develop weapons based on this technology would require a massive investment in resources and not be in their best strategic interests with regard to their nuclear program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/1999_04-05/rgam99.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 7, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051105021618/http://www.armscontrol.org/act/1999_04-05/rgam99.asp |archivedate=November 5, 2005 }} Richard Garwin, "Why China Won't Build U.S. Warheads, ''Arms Control Today'', April–May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

An assessment report that was published by Stanford University's  Center for International Security and Cooperation said that the language of the Cox report "was inflammatory and some allegations did not seem to be well supported."&lt;ref&gt;M.M. May, Editor, Alastair Johnston, W.K.H.

In '''''Croatia Meat CC v Millennium Properties (Pty) Ltd (Sofokleous Intervening)''''', an important case in the [[South African law of lease]], Sofokleous ran a supermarket from premises leased from Millennium Properties, which owned the shopping centre in which the supermarket was situated.

Clause 6.4 of the lease agreement prohibited Millennium from leasing other premises in the shopping centre for the purpose of conducting a business similar to that of the lessee.

When Sofokleous realised that Millennium had entered into a lease with Croatia Meat, giving the latter the right to run a butchery from the shopping centre, he sought an interdict prohibiting Millennium from permitting any person other than himself from conducting a butchery business from any premises in that centre.

The two main issues in the two applications were

# whether Millennium had breached its lease with Sofokleous by entering into the lease with Croatia; and, if so,
# whether Sofokleous was entitled to an interdict or Croatia to an order for specific performance.

The court held that Sofokleous was running a fully equipped butchery from within the supermarket, and that it could not be said that his was a supermarket that merely sold meat as a part of its usual range of food. Millennium had acted in breach of clause 6.4 of the lease agreement with Sofokleous when it entered into the lease with Croatia.

The question was which of the competing and irreconcilable claims for specific performance by the innocent parties, Sofokleous and Croatia, should be enforced, and which party had to be left with a claim for damages against Millennium.

The court held that, although the damages Sofokleous would suffer on a month-to-month basis appeared to be less than what Croatia was suffering, Croatia was able to limit its damages by finding alternative premises if Sofokleous's claim were upheld, resulting in a loss far less than the long-term loss that Sofokleous would suffer. There was thus no overriding equity that favoured either of the claims for specific performance.

The rule ''qui prior est tempore potior est jure'', as applied to the law of double sales, had therefore to be applied. Sofokleous's claim was upheld and that of Croatia dismissed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2019">In '''''De Jager v Sisana''''', an important case in the [[South African law of lease]], a squatter named Sisana occupied a portion of a farm under an agreement with its owner. Under this agreement, Sisana supplied the owner with certain labour in consideration for the right of occupation.

When the land was sold, the purchaser and new landowner, De Jager, having knowledge of the agreement between Sisana and the previous owner, was willing to continue the agreement as was set before. Sisana, however, refused to work for the new owner, taking up the position that he would only render services to the former owner, although he still claimed the right to remain on the land.

The court held that De Jager was entitled to an order evicting Sisana from the farm. One who purchases such land with knowledge of the agreement between its former owner and the squatter is, of course, bound by the terms of that agreement, but Sisana lost any rights he might have had against De Jager by declining to render the services to him.

The contract of a squatter, then, is not that of a tenant or lessee; it is an innominate contract under which the services of the squatter are due to the owner of the farm, who made the contract, and no one else; and the right of a purchaser of the farm to eject the squatter is not affected by notice of the existence of the contract on the part of the purchaser of the farm at the date of purchase.

The Appellate Division held that, to establish a contract of lease, the litigant must show that there was a particular thing let for a specified time and that, in return for the use of occupation of the thing, the lessee undertook to pay rent.

==Plot==
A group of 3 friends try to earn a lot of money quickly. After considering several options, they try to make a [[short film]]. They manage to get in contact with the famous actor [[Ricardo Darín]] (who plays himself in the movie), who mistook one of them as a relative of one of his friends, and agreed to work with them because of the misunderstanding. The group starts to film, and attempts to drive a car slowly towards Darín while filming; but the untrained driver accelerated instead of stopping the car, and killed him.

The three friends escaped, and all the media was filled with people asking for the whereabouts of Darín. They arranged some portions of the unreleased short film to make it seem as if Darín was leaving the country, which led to a national outrage. They tried to use a similar system to stage a request of a million dollars to the producers of his last film; those producers denounced that Darín had been kidnapped. This led to a complete national crisis, and the US threatened to start bombing Buenos Aires if Darín did not appear alive.

==Production==
''Delirium'' is the first film of director Carlos Kaimakamian Carrau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vos.lavoz.com.ar/cine/delirium-como-es-la-ultima-pelicula-de-darin|title= "Delirium": cómo es la última película de Darín|trans-title= "Delirium": How is it the most recent film of Darín|language= Spanish|author= Jesús Rubio|date= October 4, 2014|publisher= La Voz del Interior|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released when ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'', another film featuring Darín, was still in theaters.&lt;ref name="Clarinueva"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/extrashow/fama/Delirium-nueva-pelicula-Ricardo_Darin_0_1222678194.html|title= "Delirium", la nueva película de Ricardo Darín|trans-title= "Delirium", the new film of Ricardo Darín|language= Spanish|author= |date= October 2, 2014|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2018}}
'''Fabled Lands''' is the name of a series of fantasy [[gamebook]]s written by established gamebook authors [[Dave Morris (writer)|Dave Morris]] and [[Jamie Thomson (author)|Jamie Thomson]] and published by Pan Books, a division of [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] in the mid 90s.  Cover art was by Kevin Jenkins with [[Russ Nicholson]] and Arun Pottier providing maps and illustrations.

Originally planned as a twelve-book series, only six were released between 1995 and 1996 before the series was cancelled.  The first two books were also printed under the name ''Quest'' in the U.S. by publishers Price Stern Sloan. Beginning in July 2015, the makers of Fabled Lands launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund completion of Book Seven; the Kickstarter campaign hit its base target within the first 45 minutes it was online.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/57119387/fabled-lands-the-serpent-kings-domain&lt;/ref&gt;

The books are now back in print and available on Amazon as of December 2010. 

Two iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch applications were developed by Megara Entertainment. The first app, based on ''The War-Torn Kingdom'', included new colour art and original coloured in art from Russ Nicholson, and was released on January 20, 2011. The second app was released in June, 2011. Following Megara's decision to withdraw from app development in 2012, digital rights reverted to the authors and the apps were withdrawn from sale.

A Fabled Lands Role Playing Game and 12 source books based on the original game books are being written by Shane Garvey and Jamie Wallis of Greywood Publishing. The RPG rules are based on the original rules of the game books but have been expanded to accommodate an adventuring party rather than a solo player and a role playing experience rather than a game book. The twelve source books are each based on an area covered by the six published and the six unpublished game books from 1995. The first of these source books is titled ''Sokara - The War-Torn Kingdom''.&lt;ref&gt;Press release&lt;/ref&gt; The RPG and first of the source books were released in mid-2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fabledlands.blogspot.com/2010/02/fabled-news.html Fabled Lands Blog - Announcement of Iphone application]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The books deviated from other mainstream [[gamebook]]s (such as the [[Fighting Fantasy]] or [[Lone Wolf (gamebooks)|Lone Wolf]] series) in a number of ways. The most notable of these was the open-ended, free roaming gameplay. Other gamebooks gave the character a set [[quest]], with some leniency in how they went about accomplishing it; when they completed the quest, the gamebook ended. The Fabled Lands series gave the player an entire [[fantasy world]] to roam around in, doing whatever they wished with no limits or linearity; there was no set quest and there is no way to "finish" the series (unless the player dies). There are hundreds of quests in the six books that were published, of varying lengths. The player is free to pursue these at their leisure, or spend their time doing entirely different things - wandering, trading, exploring or building up their abilities.

Each book contained a different geographic area of the Fabled Lands, and the player could easily travel between regions by switching to another book. The books became increasingly difficult as they progressed, with tougher enemies and harder quests; this was to account for the player becoming more powerful as they went through each book.

Other differences between previous gamebook series included:
* A greater number of sections, 679 to 786
* Large ([[A4 paper size|A4]]) format with fold-out character sheet and colour map
* Open-ended trade via marketplace goods, investment or shipping
* Acquisition of large assets such as houses and ships
* Plot discovery through use of uncovered keywords

Although the final six books in the series have never been published (or even written), Dave Morris has indicated in the past that he is interested in reviving the series:
{{Quote|I'd love to complete the series. It would take some time to get back into the flow of it, but I still have our (very extensive) notes. I would think the first step might be to set up books 1-6 as Web pages and see what kind of interest they generated. This, I think, is a better format for gamebooks now - we are no longer in the era of the printed word. If that worked out, and the net publisher could set up a subscription system, I think Fabled Lands and many other gamebook series could enjoy quite a renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040630191402/http://www.fightingfantasy.com/index2.htm FightingFantasy.com]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On September 13, 2010, Dave Morris indicated that the series had a possible chance of a revival on his blog, saying, in response to a fan query about the future of the fabled lands and particularly the book ''The Serpent King's Domain'', "My lips are sealed, though I will say that Frank Johnson, the head of Fabled Lands LLP, was throwing those same words around last week. He might even have thrown in a labyrinth and some legions :)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fabledlands.blogspot.com/2010/09/people-dont-want-to-role-play-anymore.html?showComment=1284377992099#c1430038613351269576 Fabled Lands Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; In a later announcement, Morris indicated that the publisher was willing to greenlight the production of books 7-12 of the series, provided that the reprintings of books 1-6 each sold approximately ten thousand copies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fabledlands.blogspot.com/2010/09/return-to-fabled-lands.html Fabled Lands Blog: Return to Fabled Lands]&lt;/ref&gt;

==System==
The Fabled Lands system was fairly simple, as with most other gamebooks. The player has six basic attributes:

* Charisma - the knack of befriending and impressing people; also represents [[bard|bardic skills]]
* Combat - fighting skills
* Magic - the art of casting spells
* Sanctity - the gift of [[divinity|divine]] power and wisdom
* Scouting - the techniques of [[tracking (hunting)|tracking]] and wilderness lore
* Thievery - the talent for stealth, agility and [[lock picking]]

The player's initial score in each of these six attributes is determined by their chosen profession. There are six different professions to choose from: [[Warrior (character class)|Warrior]], [[Wizard (character class)|Mage]], [[Priest]], [[Thief (character class)|Rogue]], [[Troubadour]] and Wayfarer (a wandering traveller, most similar to [[Ranger (character class)|Rangers]] in other fantasy systems). Each profession is proficient or weak in different abilities; for example, Priests have high SANCTITY but low COMBAT scores, and Wayfarers have high SCOUTING but low CHARISMA scores. The player has opportunities to increase these abilities throughout the books by completing quests. For example, after successfully tracking down a wild boar in a forest, the player can roll two [[dice]], and if they score higher than their SCOUTING ability they can increase it by 1. No ability can be raised higher than 12, or drop below 1.

When the player is given the opportunity to use an ability, the task is given a Difficulty rating. The player rolls two dice and adds their score in the ability; to succeed in the task, they must score higher than the difficulty. For example, a player wishes to calm down an angry innkeeper. This might have a CHARISMA score of 9, and the player's CHARISMA ability is 3. The player would have to roll 7 or higher to succeed. It is possible to obtain "blessings" in various abilities from different shrines and temples, which allow the player to reroll failed ability rolls. These work once only, however, and cost money.

Combat in the Fabled Lands is an extension of ability rolls; the enemy's DEFENCE is the Difficulty, and the player uses their COMBAT skill to try to defeat their opponent. The amount the player rolls above the enemy's DEFENCE is how many Stamina points the enemy loses.

The player's own DEFENCE score is equal to their Rank + their COMBAT score + the bonus for any armour they are wearing (if any). Their own Stamina score is given when they begin playing, and can be increased by going up in Rank (which gives them 1d6 Stamina).

The player's starting Rank is equal to the number of the book they begin in (e.g. a player starting in ''The War-Torn Kingdom'' begins at 1st Rank, while a player starting in ''Lords of the Rising Sun'' begins at 6th Rank). The player can increase Rank by performing extremely difficult tasks, such as slaying a dragon or defeating three [[samurai]] in unarmed combat (the book will tell the player when they can increase in Rank).

The player can carry up to 12 possessions, which are marked in bold text (e.g. "gold compass"). Some items give ability bonuses - for example, an "amber wand (MAGIC +1)" or a set of "splint armour (DEFENCE + 4)". The player can carry unlimited amounts of cash.

The series feature a number of smaller quests, which can help the player increase their personal might, status and wealth. Many of these, however, are profession-specific: In the ''War-Torn Kingdom'', for instance, only a Wayfarer will get the Chief Druid's mission on the Druid's Isle, while in ''The Plains of Howling Darkness'' only a Rogue may claim the title of 'Nightstalker'.

==Books==

===''1. The War-Torn Kingdom''===
''Sokara, a nation at war with itself''

Set in the land of Sokara, shortly after a [[civil war]] in which the king was overthrown in a [[military coup]]. This background provides the book's two major quests; the player can choose to either help the [[heir to the throne]] and his band of [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] regain power, or assist the new leader General Grieve Marlock in crushing the last few pockets of resistance.

Other quests involve assassinating the king of the rat-men infesting the [[sanitary sewer|sewers]] in the city of Yellowport, looting treasure from the lair of Vayss the Sea Dragon, delivering packages between the [[druids]] of the City of Trees and the Forest of Larun, defeating the Black Dragon Knight in combat to the death and rescuing a trapped god from the summit of Devil's Peak.

679 sections, {{ISBN|0-330-33614-2}}

===''2. Cities of Gold and Glory''===
''Golnir, a wealthy land steeped in curious folklore''

Set in the prosperous kingdom of Golnir, wealthy from its rich [[agriculture]]. A common complaint readers had about the second book was that it was far more difficult to find quests than in the first book. There are still several major quests, however, including slaying a [[dragon]] for the Baroness Ravayne (the ruler of Golnir), searching for magical artefacts for the [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] Estragon, bringing to justice a murderer on behalf of his victim's ghost, finding the key of stars to gain access to a treasure filled tomb in the Forest of the Forsaken and making a map of the northern mountains.

The quests in the second book have a more whimsical, [[fairy tale]] nature to them than those in the first book. This gives Golnir a very strong [[Merry England]] atmosphere.

786 sections, {{ISBN|0-330-33615-0}}

===''3. Over the Blood-Dark Sea''===
''Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas''

Set in the Violet Ocean, which separates the northern continent of Harkuna from the southern continent of Ankon-Konu. Travel is severely restricted without a ship, making it a difficult book to start off in, particularly for less experienced gamebook readers. ''Over the Blood-Dark Sea'' is also one of the first in the series to feature regular danger - the player is almost always at risk of [[pirates]], [[storms]] and even [[sea monsters]]. 

Key quests include assassinating Amcha, king of the pirates, enrolling at a wizard's [[college]] in the city of Dweomer to learn [[Magic (gaming)|magic]], searching for [[buried treasure]] on hidden islands and climbing the enormous [[mountain]] on Starspike Island. 

718 sections, {{ISBN|0-330-34172-3}}

===''4. The Plains of Howling Darkness''===
''The desolate wastes of the Great Steppes''

Set in the Great Steppes, an environment of [[grassland]]s, plains and [[tundra]] similar to [[Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]]. Key quests include liberating the Citadel of Veris Corin for the King of Sokara (closely linked with quests in ''The War-Torn Kingdom''), releasing the King of Harkuna from his prison underneath the Rimewater (closely linked with quests in ''The Court of Hidden Faces'') and killing the immortal tyrant Kaschuf (based on the legend of [[Koschei]] the Deathless) who rules over the village of Vodhya (which requires the player to find and release his soul, hidden on an island in ''Over The Blood-Dark Sea'').

This was the first book in the series to introduce the concept of a harsh environment - out on the Steppes, the player must make constant SCOUTING rolls in order to find enough food, and on the northern steppes the player loses one point of stamina a day from the cold, unless they have a wolf pelt to keep warm.

710 sections, {{ISBN|0-330-34173-1}}

===''5. The Court of Hidden Faces''===
''Exotic intrigue in Uttaku and Old Harkuna''

Set in the nation of Uttaku (similar to the [[Byzantine Empire]]), which is occupying the kingdom of Old Harkuna (similar to the lands of [[Arthurian legend]]). If the player frees the king of Old Harkuna from his prison in ''The Plains of Howling Darkness'', the king can reclaim his land, end the Uttaku occupation and restore prosperity. There is also an abandoned [[castle]] in Harkuna which the player can rebuild and claim for himself. Most other major quests involve undertaking tasks for the Uttakin government (the titular Court).

The book takes its title from Uttaku's court of ruling nobles, who wear elaborate masks as a status symbol and to hide their faces. The king himself is born without a face at all.

723 sections, {{ISBN|0-330-34431-5}}

===''6. Lords of the Rising Sun''===
''Imperial Akatsurai, land of samurai and ninja''

Set in a land which is an obvious parallel of classical Japan of the [[Heian period]]. Much like ''The War Torn Kingdom'', a revolution is occurring. The self-proclaimed [[Shogun]] Yoritomo has declared himself in charge of the eastern seaboard, while the young Imperial Sovereign Takakura rules the country nominally, with real power being in the hands of the chancellor, Lord Kiyomori, who remains in control of the western seaboard. The country is on the brink of a civil war (like Japan during the [[Genpei War]] to which the names "Yoritomo" and "Kiyomori" allude). Although the player can undertake quests for both sides of the revolution, the two forces never actually begin war as they do in the first book.

Other major quests involving retrieving a tatsu [[pearl]] from a great dragon, exploring Kwaidan Forest to learn the secrets of the [[tengu]], and venturing into the Black [[Pagoda]].

750 sections, {{ISBN|0-330-34430-7}}

===''7. The Serpent King's Domain''===
''The lost tribes of the Feathered Lands''

Set in the jungles of the southern continent of Ankon-Konu, a land similar to [[Africa]] or [[South America]]. 

This book was not published in the 1990s, but in 2018 after a successful Kickstarter campaign.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/57119387/fabled-lands-the-serpent-kings-domain&lt;/ref&gt;  It was written by Paul Gresty. The spirit realm, Elaz Carnquen, hangs closely over this world, which allows you travel into the spirit realm.  And due to the excessive heat of this area, some armor cannot withstand it and you receive a handicap on your COMBAT value if you do not wear resistant armor. Quests include activating the titan at Borotek, restoring order at Ruined Tarshesh over who was to blame over the fall of it, defeating the Serpent King, Namagal (which requires some mini-quests on its own) and merging with the verdant spire, which allows dominance over the land.

1200 sections, {{ISBN|1-909-90530-5}}

===''8. The Lone and Level Sands''===
''The harsh deserts of western Ankon-konu''

This book was never published, but it would have been set in the Desert of Bones, in Ankon-Konu. This presumably would have been the Fabled Lands' equivalent of the [[Sahara]]. Notes from David Morris indicate the region is home to genii and inspired by the Thousand and One Arabian Nights. It also featured the Blue Grasslands, which according to information in the first six books is populated by blue-skinned nomads - descendants of the Uttakin featured in ''The Court Of Hidden Faces'' - and tribes like the Golden men and their flying arks. Other locations would have been the City of Stargazers, and the Country of the Hidden Ones - judging from information in the first six books, and the names on the map, it would have been similar to the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] countries of [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]] and [[Bhutan]].

The phrase 'the lone and level sands' appears in Shelley's poem ''[[Ozymandias]]''.

===''9. The Isle of a Thousand Spires''===
''Chrysoprais and the Sea of Stilts''

This book was never published, but it would have been set (as the subtitle implies) in the western locations of Chrysoprais and the Sea of Stilts.

Chrysoprais presumably would have been very similar to [[India]]; the names on the maps have an Indian flavour (for example, the Crimson Fort rather than the [[Red Fort]]). Also, a few clues are left in the first six books regarding the culture of Chrysoprais - for example, in the [[Japan]]ese-inspired land of Akatsurai featured in ''Lords of the Rising Sun'', there is a religion following the "Sage of Peace" which is clearly based on [[Buddhism]]. If the player fails in a quest relating to the Sage of Peace, they can travel west to "the saint of Vulture Peak" (found in Chrysoprais) to seek redemption and enlightenment. This suggests that people in both Chrysoprais and Akatsurai worship the Sage of Peace; in real life, [[Buddhism]] originated in [[India]] and later spread to [[Japan]].

===''10. Legions of the Labyrinth''===
''Philosopher kings of the west''

This book was never published, but would have been set in the western lands of Atticala. Atticala was clearly inspired by [[Ancient Greece]]; the map of the Fabled Lands reveals this, as many of the towns have Greek-sounding names and are symbolised by [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Greek architecture]].

The name "Atticala" is also similar to "Attica", a region of Greece.

===''11. The City in the Clouds''===
''Danger in the heart of a vast metropolis''

This book was never published, but was to have been set in the city of Dangor in the mysterious "Forbidden Realm." It is not known how the book would have been structured to fit within a single city - all other Fabled Lands books were spread over an entire landscape, with many cities and towns in between.

Very little is known about Dangor, except that it is situated at the top of cliffs hundreds of metres high called "The Golden Cliffs." Dangor's [[harbour]] is apparently at the very top of these cliffs, with the rest of the city. In ''Over The Blood Dark Sea'', the player can read the account of a Sokaran sailor in the [[library]] of Dweomer. He recounts of how his ship waited for three days at the bottom of the cliffs, while a mountain climber took their documents to the port authorities above. When all was found to be in order, "grapples were lowered and secured and the whole vessel was winched up to the docks a thousand feet above."

Dangor may have been inspired by the near East, as it is symbolized by what appears to be a near Eastern palace on the map.

===''12. Into the Underworld''===
''The ultimate journey''

This book was never published, but it would have been set in the [[underworld]] of the Fabled Lands. Whether the authors intended for this to be a series of caves and caverns or a literal [[Hell]] (or both) is uncertain; there are many entrances to the twelfth book throughout the first six. Some of these are through caves and tunnels, while others are through magical gateways, by falling off the edge of the world (in both of these instances the player is told that they will arrive in "Hell"), or even board a ship in a celestial harbor.

A series of magical gateways found throughout the books allows the player to travel instantaneously to the many cities of the Fabled Lands, including those in books that were never published. One of these was called "Erebus" and sent the player to the twelfth book. In [[Greek mythology]], [[Erebus]] was a god associated with the underworld.

==Planned MMO==

In 1996, the authors decided to use their experience with gamebooks to enter the computer games industry – taking the Fabled Lands series with them. They started work at [[Eidos Interactive]] on an [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]]. Eidos was sceptical as to whether an MMO could be successful, but was interested to see what might happen, and set the authors up with a team to research the relevant technology. The team's plans for the game were extremely ambitious for the late 90s, as the Fabled Lands MMO was supposed to include an advanced AI that acted as a digital gamesmaster, tailoring the experience for each player. 
 
The game was never released; according to Morris and Thomson, this was caused by their own over-ambitious designs, colleagues who didn't understand their ideas and the general poor management of game design and development at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/pc/2010/04/09/fabled-lands-the-mmo-that-never-was/3 bit-tech.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Financial Ombudsman Service''' ('''FOS''') is a member-funded [[Australia]]n [[ombudsman]] service that provides external [[dispute resolution]] for consumers who are unable to resolve complaints with member [[financial services]] organisations.

{{as of|2016|06|30}} the FOS had approximately 5,500 licensed member organisations that included banks, insurers, credit providers, financial advisers and planners, debt collection agencies and other businesses that provide financial products and services; together with an additional 8,000 authorised credit representatives. The Service is governed by its term of reference which allow for it to hear matters within six years of the first knowledge of a financial loss and, since January 2015, for the Service to award remedies capped at {{AUD}}309,000. In 2015-6, the FOS received 34,095 disputes and closed 32,871 disputes; a seven per cent increase on the number of disputes received during the previous year and a five per cent decrease on the number of disputes closed.&lt;ref name="AR2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fos.org.au/custom/files/docs/20152016-fos-annual-review.pdf |title=Annual Review 2015–16 |work=Financial Ombudsman Service |publisher= |date=2016 |accessdate=8 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}

The FOS is led by the Chief Ombudsman, presently Shane Tregillis. He is supported by lead ombudsmen for banking and finance, [[general insurance]], and investment and advice; with ten other ombudsmen supporting various functional areas and disputes.

== History ==

The FOS was established on 1 July 2008 following the merger of the Financial Industry Complaints Service (FICS) with the Banking and Financial Services Ombudsman (BFSO) and Insurance Ombudsman Service (IOS); all of which were industry self-regulatory bodies.&lt;ref name="asic1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=ASIC-approved dispute resolution schemes |publisher=[[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] |url=http://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/dispute-resolution/asic-approved-dispute-resolution-schemes/ |accessdate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two additional schemes chose to merge with the FOS later in 2009, the Credit Union Dispute Resolution Centre and the Insurance Brokers Disputes Limited.&lt;ref name="asic1" /&gt;

== Operations and processes ==

=== Principles ===
The principles underpinning FOS’s operations and processes are to resolve disputes between consumers and financial services providers in accordance with its Terms of Reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=ASIC – What to do if you are dissatisfied with a decision |url=http://asic.gov.au/about-asic/contact-us/how-to-complain/external-dispute-resolution-what-to-do-if-you-are-dissatisfied-with-a-decision/ |publisher=ASIC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks and financial services providers must be licensed to provide their services to consumers. It is a condition of such a licence that the bank or financial services provider be a member of an [[External Dispute Resolution]] (EDR) scheme that is approved by ASIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawhandbook.sa.gov.au/ch09s04.php |title=Complaints against banking and financial services |publisher=Legal Services Commission of Australia |accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   FOS and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO) are the two schemes approved by ASIC under the Corporations Act and the National Consumer Credit Protection Act&lt;ref name="asic1" /&gt;

=== Resolution process ===
The FOS only considers a complaint after the customer has first attempted and failed to resolve their complaint directly with their financial services provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to complain |url=https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/tools-and-resources/how-to-complain |publisher=ASIC |work=ASIC MoneySmart |date= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most disputes with financial services providers in Australia are resolved between the customer and the relevant bank, credit provider, insurance company or other financial services provider. However, if a dispute is not able to be resolved directly, FOS can then consider it.

The FOS can make an official recommendation or determination and require a financial services provider to;
* pay a sum of money
* waive, vary the terms or release security for a debt
* repay, waive or vary a fee including interest rates on a loan
* vary the terms of a credit contract in cases of financial hardship
* honour an insurance policy claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.choice.com.au/shopping/consumer-rights-and-advice/make-a-complaint/articles/how-ombudsman-services-can-help-you |title=How ombudsman services can help you |work=CHOICE |date= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complainant (but not the financial services provider) may accept or reject the determination within 30 days of receiving it.  If the complainant accepts the determination, it is binding on both parties. Dispute resolution by the FOS is free of charge for consumers.

=== Governance ===
The FOS is governed by an board of consumer representatives and financial services industry representatives. The Chair of the Board, since 2015, is Professor [[The Honourable|the Hon.]] [[Michael Lavarch]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}}. A [[public company]] limited by guarantee, called the Financial Ombudsman Service Limited,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url= |title=Financial Ombudsman Service: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde? |author1=Griffiths, Tim |author2=Mitchell, Jacqui |date=2012 |journal=ILB |volume=27 |number=9 |page=130|doi= |pmid= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the owner of the FOS. This company is approved by the [[Australian Securities and Investment Commission]] (ASIC) in accordance with Regulatory Guide 139.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''Corporations Act 2001'' (Cth) s 912A&lt;/ref&gt;

== Senate complaint ==
In 2015 a complaint was raised in Submission 134 to the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] committee on the scrutiny of financial advice concerning six conversations between the Ombudsman and a consumer’s representative, who had recorded the telephone conversation. Submission 134 made it clear that there were differences between the telephone recordings and the working notes of those conversations made by the Ombudsman.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Thereafter the Ombudsman was reported by media as having confirmed "the decision to refer the matter to a court given the complexity of the dispute, the inability of the FOS to cross examine all relevant witnesses and compel the production of information from third parties, as well as the need to engage experts",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankingday.com/nl06_news_selected.php?selkey=17837|title=FOS staff shortages oblige ANZ to suspend recovery action |work=Banking Day |last=Rogers |first=Ian |date=24 November 2014 |access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though in recordings of the conversations the same Ombudsman said the only reason to dismiss the complaint was lack of staff, that the complaint had merit and that if the FOS had staff they would have ruled the dispute inside jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="abc answer"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-01/long-the-questions-the-financial-ombudsman-needs-to-answer/7292044|title=The questions the Financial Ombudsman needs to answer|date=2016-04-01|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abc calls"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-16/calls-for-financial-ombudsman-service-to-be-disbanded/7250894|title=Calls for Financial Ombudsman Service to be disbanded over credibility issues|date=2016-03-16|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this decision that subsequently resulted in [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Supreme Court]] proceedings to challenge the jurisdictional decision of the FOS not to handle the particular complaint.

The FOS did not respond in substance. ASIC did not respond to the questions and, since the filing, other senators called for the FOS to explain the circumstances. ASIC appeared before the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on 16 March 2015, where it stated that the Court dealt ith the issue of the misleading file notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services |work=[[Hansard]] |location=Australia |date=16 March 2016 |author=Kell, Peter |author2=Day, Warren |author3=Medcraft, Greg }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June 2015, the Supreme Court of Victoria found in the FOS's favour but it did not address the discrepancies in materials. The Court stated in its judgment that it did not examine any issues beyond the actual decision of the FOS itself, thus it did not examine any materials (including the file notes and the recordings), nor did it dealt with any allegations of misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSC|292|2015|litigants=Goldie Marketing  Pty Ltd v Financial Ombudsman Services |pinpoint=83 |parallelcite=|date=19 June 2015 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FOS released a media statement attempting to dismiss the allegations and rely on the ruling by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://fos.org.au/news/media/financial-ombudsman-service-decision-supported-by-court/|title=Financial Ombudsman Service decision supported by Court |publisher=Financial Ombudsman Service |date= |access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement did not address allegations in the submission about misleading file notes presented in the discovery phase of a trial.&lt;ref name="abc answer" /&gt; Following media coverage of this case there were calls by a number of Australian Senators, including Senator [[Nick Xenophon]], for the FOS to be disbanded and replaced with a government funded body.&lt;ref name="abc calls" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abc answer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=ABC News |location=Australia |url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2016/s4426506.htm|title=Financial Ombudsman Service under fire as politicians demand change|date=2016-03-17|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite criticism of the FOS, consumer advocacy group [[Choice (Australian consumer organisation)|CHOICE]] and the government regulator, ASIC, are generally supportive of the FOS. CHOICE has stated that "while there is room for improvement, the Financial Ombudsman Service is providing an essential service of a high standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://consumeraction.org.au/joint-submission-independent-review-of-the-financial-ombudsman-service/|title=Joint submission: Independent Review of the Financial Ombudsman Service |date=2013-10-29|website=Consumer Action|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.choice.com.au/shopping/consumer-rights-and-advice/taking-action-and-making-a-complaint/articles/how-ombudsman-services-can-help-you|title=How ombudsman services can help you|last=Kollmorgen|first=Andy|date=5 September 2014|website=|publisher=[[Choice (Australian consumer organisation)|CHOICE]]|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, ASIC have continued to support the FOS as an 'approved EDR scheme'.&lt;ref name="asic1" /&gt;

In November 2016, the FOS attempted to explain limitations to its capability to enforce its rulings when financial services providers would not or were unable to pay compensation in cases decided in a consumer's favour. In such cases, consumers may have to seek formal Court-based enforcement proceedings or assistance from the industry regulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/financial-services/chasing-down-wrongdoers-is-not-our-job-fos/news-story/00ccb9938b107c7157eeabecbd144f2b|title=Chasing down wrongdoers is not our job: FOS|last=|first=|date=|work=[[The Australian]]|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FOS has proposed an industry funded 'compensation scheme of last resort' be established to help pay consumers their awarded compensation if left stranded by insolvent or belligerent providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.financialobserver.com.au/articles/fos-calls-for-last-resort-compensation|title=FOS calls for last resort compensation|last= |first= |date=24 April 2016 |work=Financial Observer|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government review ==
In 2016 the government announced a review into Australia's EDR schemes for the financial system, including the FOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://kmo.ministers.treasury.gov.au/media-release/072-2016/|title=Review of external dispute resolution and complaints scheme|last=O'Dwyer |first=Kelly |authorlink=Kelly O'Dwyer |date=8 August 2016 |website=|publisher=Australian Government |access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016 a [[Australian House of Representatives|Lower House]] parliamentary committee, which has a majority of incumbent government MPs, recommended a banking tribunal be established to replace the FOS, the Credit and Investments Ombudsman and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-24/parliamentary-committee-calls-for-banking-tribunal-after-inquiry/8053514|title=Parliamentary Committee Calls for Banking Tribunal after Inquiry|last= |first= |date=24 November 2016 |work=ABC News|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of the EDR review is expected in March 2017. In December 2016 an [[Department of the Treasury (Australia)|Australian Treasury]] appointed panel agreed that the FOS needs an added accountability mechanism in the form of an independent auditor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifa.com.au/news/17176-fos-should-be-subject-to-investigation-report-recommends|title=FOS should be subject to investigation, report recommends |last=|first=|date=7 December 2016|website=Independent Financial Advisor|publisher=|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dummies (2973280850).jpg|thumb|Various books in the series]]

'''''For Dummies''''' is an extensive series of instructional/[[Reference work|reference books]] which are intended to present non-intimidating guides for readers new to the various topics covered.  The series has been a worldwide success with editions in numerous languages.

The books are an example of a [[media franchise]], consistently sporting a distinctive cover—usually yellow and black with a triangular-headed cartoon figure known as the "Dummies Man", and an informal, blackboard-style logo. Prose is simple and direct; bold icons, such as a piece of string tied around an index finger, are placed in the margin to indicate particularly important passages.

Almost all ''Dummies'' books are organized around sections called "parts", which are groups of related chapters. Parts are almost always preceded by a [[The 5th Wave (comic strip)|Rich Tennant]] comic that refers to some part of the subject under discussion. Sometimes the same Tennant drawing reappears in another ''Dummies'' book with a new caption.

Another constant in the ''Dummies'' series is "The Part of Tens", a section at the end of the books where lists of 10 items are included. They are usually resources for further study and sometimes also include amusing bits of information that do not fit readily elsewhere.

== History ==
The first title, ''[[DOS]] For Dummies'',{{r|Success-Story.id-323929}} was written by [[Dan Gookin]] and published in November 1991 by IDG Books. ''DOS For Dummies'' became popular due to the rarity of beginner-friendly materials for using DOS. The Windows title written by [[Andy Rathbone]] was soon released. While initially the series focused solely on software and technology topics, it later branched out to more general-interest titles, with topics as diverse as ''[[Acne]] For Dummies'', ''[[Chess]] For Dummies'', ''[[Fishing]] For Dummies'' and many other topics, including recent legal topics with ''Success as a Mediator For Dummies'' in 2012. The series is now published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]], which acquired Hungry Minds (the new name for IDG Books as of 2000) in early 2001.{{r|pressReleaseId-48771}}

== Landmark ''For Dummies'' books ==
Notable ''For Dummies'' books include:
* ''DOS For Dummies'', the first, published in 1991, whose first printing was just 7,500 copies{{r|eyepopping}}{{r|Group Grant 1999 p.222}}
* ''Windows for Dummies'', asserted to be the best-selling computer book of all time, with more than 15 million sold{{r|eyepopping}}
* ''L'Histoire de France Pour Les Nuls'', the top-selling non-English ''For Dummies'' title, with more than 400,000 sold{{r|eyepopping}}

== Expansions and alternative versions ==
Several related series have been published, including ''Dummies 101'', with step-by-step tutorials in a large-format book (now discontinued); ''More&amp;nbsp;... for Dummies'', which are essentially sequels to the first ''...&amp;nbsp;For Dummies'' book on the subject; ''For Dummies Quick Reference'', which is a condensed alphabetical reference to the subject. A larger ''All-in-One Desk Reference'' format offers more comprehensive coverage of the subject, normally running about 750 pages.  Also, some books in the series are smaller and do not follow the same formatting style as the others.

Wiley has also launched an interactive online course with [[Learnstreet]] based on its popular book, ''Java for Dummies'', 5th edition.{{r|learnstreet}}

A spin-off board game, ''[[Crossword]]s for Dummies'', was produced in the late 1990s.{{r|Parker}}  The game is similar to ''[[Scrabble]]'', but instead of letter tiles, players draw short strips of cardboard containing pre-built English words.  The words vary in length from three to seven letters, with more points acquired for playing longer words. Another board game, ''SAT Game for Dummies'', is used in [[SAT]] preparation. A ''[[Chess]] for Dummies'' was made, a black-and-yellow chessboard with a picture of a piece, along with a summary of how the piece moves, printed its starting positions, although there is a book with the same name.

In 2009, French publisher [[Anuman Interactive]] obtained the digital exploitation rights and launched many applications based on the ''For Dummies'' collection, such as ''Home Design 3D For Dummies'' and ''History For Dummies''.{{r|lesechos}}

== Authors ==
With more than 200 million books in print and around 2,500 titles,{{r|All-Titles}} ''For Dummies'' brings together a bevy of authors including [[Dan Gookin]], [[Karl Barksdale]], Michael Taillard and [[Andy Rathbone]], Mary Jane Sterling, Mark Ryan and [[Stephen P. Maran]].{{r|dummies.com 2016}}{{r|Wiley Dummies}}

In 1991 he was attending a publishing conference as the co-founder and publisher of IDG Books Worldwide. One of the speakers at the conference was author Dan Gookin. Impressed with Gookin's take on the publishing industry, Kilcullen signed him up to author ''DOS for Dummies''. The first print run of ''DOS for Dummies'' was 7,500 copies. The book ...

The '''''A–Z''''' (pronounced "Ay to Zed"), or in full the '''''Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas''''', is a name given to any one of a range of [[atlas (cartography)|atlases]] of streets in the [[United Kingdom]] currently produced by [[Geographers' A-Z Map Company|Geographers' A–Z Map Company Limited]]. Its first atlas, of [[London]], was originally compiled in the 1930s by [[Phyllis Pearsall]]. The company she founded now publishes [[street map]]s of many cities and towns in the UK.

==Dating old maps==
[[File:Geographers London Map 1957 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The cover of the ''Authentic Map of London'' of 1957]]
Until relatively recently, maps produced by the ''Geographers' (A–Z) Map Company'' did not include a publication date. Some clues to dating include:
* their first map was published in 1936;
* the only maps produced by them during WW2 (1939–1945) were war maps of Europe;
* until 1962, the "Published By" address was ''24 [[Grays Inn Road]], [[Holborn]], London'';
* from 1962 to 1992, the "Published By" address was ''[[Sevenoaks]], Kent'';
* from 1992 onwards, the "Published By" address is ''[[Borough Green]], Kent'';
* in 1972, the company name was changed from ''Geographers' Map Company'' to ''[[Geographers' A-Z Map Company|Geographers' A–Z Map Company]]''.

===Coded date===
On all A–Z maps, there is a 3 or 4 letter code in one of the corners, often the one containing the key. These letters represent numbers, which are the cartographic date, in the form (M)MYY. There was at least one scheme used, and perhaps a second.

In one scheme, the letters JIHGFEDCBA represent the digits 1 to 9 and 0, so that HFD would be 357, indicating a publication date of March 1957. This seems to have been used on all the company's folding maps, and possibly also those in book form.

==Media appearance==
The ''Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas'' and the story of how [[Phyllis Pearsall]] came to write the first edition covering [[London]] were featured in a 2005 episode of [[Nicholas Crane]]'s ''[[Map Man]]'' TV programme. This revealed that, on all their maps, A–Z print a non-existent [[trap street]] so that they can tell if a map has been illegally copied from theirs, a technique used by several publishers of reference works (see [[fictitious entry]]).

The story of Pearsall's creation of the A–Z also inspired the  musical ''[[The A–Z of Mrs P]]''.

The London A–Z is a plot device in "[[The Blind Banker]]", the second episode of the first series of the BBC drama ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'' when the protagonist is attempting to decipher a book code used by an international smuggling ring based on a book "everybody owns". After attempting to decipher the code using a [[dictionary]] and the [[Bible]], Sherlock goes out into [[Baker Street]] and appropriates a copy of the A–Z after seeing it being used by a couple of tourists.

==2012 Olympics==
''Geographers' A-Z Map Company'' was the official supplier of atlases and maps for the [[2012 Olympic Games]] and [[2012 Paralympic Games]] and produced detailed maps for the Olympic Park in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]], as well as all the other venues that were used during the games in [[London]] and throughout the [[United Kingdom]]. They produced three special maps detailing transport information on getting to the venues and also provided information on events related to the [[2012 Cultural Olympiad]]. In addition, A–Z provided special sections relating to the Games in their 2012 editions of their main UK-wide and local maps.

[[File:Salon de locomotion aerienne 1909 Grand Palais Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Paris Air Show|Salon de la locomotion aérienne]], 1909, Grand Palais, [[Paris]]]]
The '''Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées''', commonly known as the '''Grand Palais''' ([[English language|English]]: Great Palace), is a large [[historic site]], [[exhibition hall]] and [[museum]] complex located at the [[Champs-Élysées]] in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]], France. Construction of the Grand Palais began in 1897 following the demolition of the [[Palais de l'Industrie]] (Palace of Industry) as part of the preparation works for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exposition of 1900]], which also included the creation of the adjacent [[Petit Palais]] and [[Pont Alexandre III]].&lt;ref name="history 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.champs-elysees-paris.org/?p=2489|title=Grand Palais|accessdate=2010-07-08|publisher=Champs-elysees-paris.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been listed since 2000 as a ''[[monument historique]]'' by the [[French Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref name="merimee"&gt;{{Base Mérimée|PA00088877}} Grand Palais&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure was built in the style of [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] as taught by the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] of Paris. The building reflects the movement's taste for ornate decoration through its stone [[facade]]s, the formality of its floor planning and the use of techniques that were innovative at the time, such as its glass vault, its structure made of [[iron]] and [[Steel frame#Light steel framing|light steel framing]], and its use of [[reinforced concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/digital/worldsfairs/record.jsp?pid=umd:1000| title=Paris 1900: Grand Palais|accessdate=2010-07-08|author=Sesan Iwarere|publisher=University of Maryland Libraries|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
One of its pediments calls it a "monument dedicated by the Republic to the glory of French art", reflecting its original purpose, that of housing the great artistic events of the city of Paris. The competition to choose the architect was fierce and controversial, and ultimately resulted in the contract being awarded to a group of four architects, [[Henri Deglane (architect)|Henri Deglane]], [[Albert Louvet]], [[Albert Thomas (architect)|Albert Thomas]] and [[Charles Girault]], each with a separate area of responsibility.

The main space, almost 240 metres long, was constructed with an iron, steel and glass barrel-vaulted roof, making it the last of the large transparent structures inspired by London’s [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] that were necessary for large gatherings of people before the age of electricity. The main space was originally connected to the other parts of the palace along an east-west axis by a grand staircase in a style combining [[classical architecture|Classical]] and [[Art Nouveau]], but the interior layout has since been somewhat modified.

The exterior of this massive palace combines an imposing Classical stone façade with a riot of [[Art Nouveau]] ironwork, and a number of allegorical statue groups including work by sculptors [[Paul Gasq]], [[Camille Lefèvre]], [[Alfred Boucher]], [[Alphonse-Amédée Cordonnier]] and [[Raoul Verlet]].  A monumental bronze [[quadriga]] by [[Georges Récipon]] tops each wing of the main façade. The one on the Champs-Élysées side depicts Immortality prevailing over Time, the one on the [[Seine]] side Harmony triumphing over Discord.

The grand inauguration took place 1 May 1900, and from the very beginning the palace was the site of different kinds of shows in addition to the intended art exhibitions. These included a riding competition that took place annually from 1901 to 1957, but were mainly dedicated to innovation and modernity: the automobile, aviation, household appliances, and so on. The golden age of the art exhibitions as such lasted for some thirty years, while the last took place in 1947.  The first major [[Henri Matisse]] retrospective after his death was held at the Grand Palais.
 
The structure had problems that started even before it was completed, mainly as a result of subsidence caused by a drop in the water table. The builders attempted to compensate for this subsidence, and for a tendency of the ground to shift, by sinking supporting posts down to firmer soil, since construction could not be delayed. These measures were only partially successful. Further damage occurred once the building was in use. Excessive force applied to structural members during the installation of certain exhibitions such as the [[Paris Air Show|Exposition Internationale de la Locomotion Aérienne]] caused damage, as did acid runoff from the horse shows.
Additional problems due to the construction of the building itself revealed themselves over the course of time. Differential rates of expansion and contraction between cast iron and steel members, for example, allowed for water to enter, leading to corrosion and further weakening. When finally one of the glass ceiling panels fell in 1993, the main space had to be closed for restoration work, and was not fully reopened to the public until 2007.

== Wartime and the Palais ==
[[File:The Great Nave - Wounded Soldiers Performing Arms Drill at the End of Their Medical Treatment.jpg|thumb|left|Grand Palais during World War I, 1916]]
The Palais served as a military hospital during [[World War I]], employing local artists who had not been deployed to the front to decorate hospital rooms or to make moulds for prosthetic limbs.

The [[Nazi]]s put the Palais to use during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|Occupation of France]] in [[World War II]]. First used as a truck depot, the Palais then housed two Nazi propaganda exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandpalais.fr/en/The-building/History/Stories-of-the-Grand-Palais/p-610-lg1-Wartime.htm |title=Wartime |publisher=GrandPalais.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parisian resistance used the Grand Palais as a headquarters during the Liberation of Paris. On 23 August 1944 an advancing German column was fired upon from a window on the Avenue de Sèlves, and the Germans responded with a tank attack upon the Palais. The attack ignited hay that was set up for a circus show, and over the next 48 hours, thick black smoke from the fire caused serious damage to the building. By 26 August, American jeeps were parked in the nave, followed by tanks from the [[2nd Armored Division (France)|French 2nd Armored Division]], completing the liberation of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandpalais.fr/fr/Le-monument/Histoire/Ca-s-est-passe-au-Grand-Palais/p-141-Dans-la-tourmente-des-deux-guerres.htm |title=Dans la tourmente des deux guerres |publisher=GrandPalais.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517123316/http://www.grandpalais.fr/fr/Le-monument/Histoire/Ca-s-est-passe-au-Grand-Palais/p-141-Dans-la-tourmente-des-deux-guerres.htm |archivedate=2012-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Collection des FFL (Forces Françaises Libres). |url=http://www.ecpad.fr/collection-des-ffl-forces-francaises-libres |title=Collection des FFL (Forces Françaises Libres). – ECPAD |publisher=Ecpad.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Grand Palais today ==
[[File:Le Grand Palais depuis le pont Alexandre III à Paris.jpg|right|thumb|The Grand Palais seen from [[Pont Alexandre III]]]]
[[File:Grand Palaais 501590 fh000034.jpg|right|thumb|The interior]]

The Grand Palais has a major police station in the basement whose officers help protect the exhibits on show in the [[Galeries nationales du Grand Palais]], particularly the picture exhibition "salons": the Salon de la [[Société Nationale des Beaux Arts]], [[Salon d'Automne]], and [[Salon Comparaisons]]. The building's west wing also contains a [[science museum]], the [[Palais de la Découverte]].

It was the host venue of the [[2010 World Fencing Championships]].

For the 2011 Monumenta exhibition (11 May to 23 June), sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] was commissioned to create the temporary indoor site-specific installation, ''Leviathan'', an enormous (ca. 775,000 square feet) structure that filled half of the main exhibition hall of the Grand Palais.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designboom.com/art/anish-kapoor-monumenta-2011-leviathan/ "Anish Kapoor: Leviathan for Monumenta 2011"] at designboom.com; Lauren Houssin, [http://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/kapoors-leviathan-fills-grand-palais-in-paris/?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%221%22%3A%22RI%3A9%22%7D "Kapoor’s ‘Leviathan’ Fills Grand Palais in Paris"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (31 May 2011); Mark Hudson, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-reviews/8506594/Anish-Kapoor-Leviathan-Monumenta-2011-Grand-PalaisParis-review.html "Anish Kapoor: Leviathan, Monumenta 2011, Grand Palais, Paris, review"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' (11 May 2011). Retrieved 21 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was used during the final stage of the [[2017 Tour de France|Tour de France]] in 2017, as part of the promotion for Paris' [[Paris bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics|2024 Summer Olympics bid]].  The riders rode through the Palais en route to the [[Champs Élysées]].  With Paris having been unanimously awarded the 2024 Games, the Palais will be used for the fencing and taekwondo events.

The '''Great North Museum: Hancock''' is a museum of [[natural history]] and ancient civilisations in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]].

The museum was established in 1884 and was formerly known as the '''Hancock Museum'''.  In 2006 it merged with [[Newcastle University|Newcastle University's]] [[Hatton Gallery]] to form the [[Great North Museum]]. The museum reopened as the Great North Museum: Hancock in May 2009 following a major extension and refurbishment of the original [[Victorian era|Victorian]] building.
The museum and most of its collections are owned by the [[Natural History Society of Northumbria]], and it is managed by [[Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums]] on behalf of Newcastle University.

== Location ==
The museum is located on the campus of [[Newcastle University]], next to the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]], and close to Barras Bridge. The nearest [[Tyne &amp; Wear Metro]] station is [[Haymarket Metro station|Haymarket]], and there is also a [[Haymarket bus station|bus station at Haymarket]].

One of the Second World War air raid shelter openings into the [[Victoria Tunnel (Newcastle)|Victoria Tunnel]] is beneath the grounds of the museum.

== History ==
[[File:Hancock Museum logo.png|thumb|right|240px|The Hancock Museum logo used immediately prior to becoming the Great North Museum.]]
The collection of the Hancock Museum can be traced to about 1780 when [[Marmaduke Tunstall]] started accumulating [[ethnography|ethnographic]] and [[natural history]] material from around the world. He then brought his collection from London to North Yorkshire. In 1790 Tunstall died, and [[George Allan (antiquary)|George Allan]] of Darlington purchased Tunstall's collection; and later in 1823 it was acquired by the [[Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne]]. In 1829 the Natural History Society of [[Northumberland]], [[Durham, England|Durham]] and Newcastle upon Tyne (now the [[Natural History Society of Northumbria]]) was formed as a scientific offshoot of the Literary and Philosophical Society. Amongst the founding and early members of the Natural History Society were [[Joshua Alder]], [[Albany Hancock]], [[John Hancock (ornithologist)|John Hancock]], [[Prideaux John Selby]] and [[William Chapman Hewitson]].

The museum opened on its current site in 1884 after the collection of the Natural History Society outgrew its small museum, located on Westgate Road, which opened in 1834.&lt;ref name=twhist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/hancock/ourhistory/ |title=Our History (archived) |website=Tyne and Wear Museums |accessdate=29 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706044909/http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/hancock/ourhistory/ |archivedate=6 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major benefactor to the museum was [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] who gave the then large sum of £11,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seahouses.journallive.co.uk/2010/02/lord-armstrong-bicentennial-to.html |title=Lord Armstrong bicentennial to be marked with special events |publisher=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong had also founded the College of Physical Science which later became part of Newcastle University. The museum was renamed in the 1890s, after the local [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Natural history|naturalists]], [[Albany Hancock|Albany]] and [[John Hancock (ornithologist)|John Hancock]].&lt;ref name=twhist /&gt; In 1959 the Natural History Society agreed with the University of Newcastle for the University to care for the building and collections, and since 1992 the University has contracted with Tyne &amp; Wear Museums to manage the Museum under a Service Level Agreement.&lt;ref name=twhist /&gt;

=== Reopening as Great North Museum ===

Donors to the campaign have the opportunity to have their name (or the name of a loved one) permanently included on a donor wall in the museum.

The Great North Museum formally re-opened on 23 May 2009. In August the museum announced that they had surpassed their expected annual target of 300,000 visitors. By August over 400,000 people had visited the reopened museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2009/08/29/great-north-museum-tops-its-target-61634-24558320/ |title=Great North Museum tops its target |publisher=The Journal |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 November 2009 [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM The Queen]] officially opened the Great North Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/press.release/item/royal-opening-for-great-north-museum1 |title=Royal opening for Great North Museum |publisher=Newcastle University |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''guestbook''' (also '''guest book''', '''visitor log''', '''visitors' book''', '''visitors' album''') is a paper or electronic means for a visitor to acknowledge a visit to a site, physical or web-based, and leave details such as their name, postal or electronic address and any comments.  Such paper-based ledgers or books are traditional in [[church (building)|churches]], at [[wedding]]s, [[funeral]]s, [[Bed and breakfast|B&amp;Bs]], [[museum]]s, [[school]]s, [[institution]]s and other private facilities open to the public.  Some private homes keep visitors' books.  Specialised forms of guestbooks include hotel registers, wherein guests are required to provide their contact information, and Books of Condolence, which are used at funeral homes and more generally after notable public deaths, such as the death of a monarch or president, or after a public disaster, such as an airplane crash.
[[File:National Library of Israel, Salant Hotel Guestbook 80907 0005 tif manifestation.jpg|thumb|A guestbook from the Salant Hotel, held by the National Library of Israel]]
On the web, a guestbook is a logging system that allows visitors of a [[website]] to leave a public comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXELAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT294#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Increase Your Web Traffic In a Weekend | publisher=Cengage Learning | author=Ford, Jerry Lee Jr. | year=2011 | pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible in some guestbooks for visitors to express their thoughts about the website or its subject. Generally, they do not require the poster to create a user account, as it is an informal method of dropping off a quick message. The purpose of a website guestbook is to display the kind of visitors the site gets, including the part of the world they reside in, and gain [[feedback]] from them. This allows the [[webmaster]] to assess and improve their site. A guestbook is generally a [[Scripting language|script]], which is usually remotely hosted and written in a language such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Active Server Pages|ASP]]. Many free guestbook hosts and scripts exist.

Names and addresses provided in guestbooks, paper-based or electronic, are frequently recorded and collated for use in providing statistics about visitors to the site, and to contact visitors to the site in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6406">A '''ladder tournament''' (also known as a '''ladder competition'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Ladder Competition?|url=http://sportmeets.com/help/topic/aboutLadders|website=Sportmeets|publisher=Sportmeets UK Ltd.|accessdate=17 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''pyramid tournament'''{{sfn|Byl|2006|pp=115}}{{sfn|Sharma|1994|pp=41}}) is a form of [[tournament]] for games and sports. Unlike many tournaments, which usually have an element of elimination, ladder competitions can go on indefinitely. In a ladder competition, players are listed as if on the rungs of a ladder. The objective for a player is to reach the highest rung of the ladder.{{sfn|Byl|2006|pp=114}}

== Description ==

The competition proceeds via a system of challenges. Any player can challenge a player above them on the ladder. These challenges generally should not or can not be declined. If the lower-placed player wins the match, then the two players swap places on the ladder. If the lower-placed player loses, then they may not challenge the same person again without challenging someone else first. There is a limit as to how many rungs above themselves players may challenge.{{sfn|Sharma|1994|pp=41}}{{sfn|Byl|2002|pp=209}}  When first setting up a ladder tournament, the usual practice is to place the more skilled players at the bottom of the ladder, so that they have to play to work their way up.{{sfn|Sharma|1994|pp=41}}

Ladder competitions suffer from two problems, both resulting from the challenge system. The first is that the ranking at the end of the tournament (or after a sufficiently long time) may not necessarily reflect the actual rank of the players, since it is not guaranteed that enough challenges, or the appropriate challenges, have been made to correctly "sort" the ladder. However, if the balance between number of participants and duration of the competition is defined properly, this usually results in a representative ranking. The second is that some players may make challenges more frequently than others, or are challenged more frequently than others, meaning that not all players may be challenged, and that not all players may play the same number of matches.{{sfn|Byl|2002|pp=209}}

== Example ==

An example of a ladder competition is shown below. Note that the 3 images below show the exact same competition. Each level has its own colour.

Player Rafael is allowed to challenge anyone who is ranked higher than him on his own level, and anyone who is ranked one level higher than he. Thus, Rafael is allowed to challenge the following players : Roger, Isabelle, Estelle and Sofie.

== Uses ==

Ladders are typically used in sports such as [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[badminton]] &amp; [[Korea Baseball Organization]].

Other systems calculate a numeric rank for each player. This removes the limitation on which matches are allowed. The most widely known system of ranking players is the [[Elo rating system]], which is used for [[Chess]] and [[Go (board game)|Go]].  Every player in the Elo rating system receives a rating based on his or her win/loss record, which establishes his or her position (or level) on the ''game ladder.''  Numerous efforts have been made to design better game ladders by analyzing the [[statistical correlation]] between relative ladder levels and a player's expected performance.

A game ladder may be used as the ranking system itself, in lieu of a ranking system like Elo.  In this case, players are moved up and down the ladder according to competitive results, dictated by previously determined rules.

A unique game ladder system is the [[Masterpoints]] rating system used for [[contract bridge]] by the [[American Contract Bridge League]].  The Masterpoints system, unlike the Elo rating system, emphasizes participation (i.e., experience in terms of number of games played) over demonstration of skill.

The [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] considers its official rankings (decided by a media pool, based on match results) when matchmaking, though not strictly. Due to the high incidence of training injuries, unranked or low-ranked replacement fighters often compete higher up the ladder than they otherwise would. This is also (more rarely, usually on [[pay-per-view]]) done for promotional reasons, when a big name or rivalry makes a low-ranked fighter the more marketable option. Sometimes no similarly-ranked opponents are available, and a fighter may risk losing their spot to a low-ranked one just to stay busy. Winners are interviewed after fights, and all fighters are required to use [[Twitter]]. Challenges through these avenues (and others) are encouraged. Though not binding, a publicly agreed fight usually occurs as soon as practical. Rematches are generally disallowed, excepting some championship bouts and others ending in controversial decisions.

The [[Korea Baseball Organization]] has the fourth-seeded team play host to the fifth seed, with the winner playing the third seed. The second-seeded team plays the winner of that game, and whoever wins advances to play the top-seeded team in the [[Korean Series]].

This page provides '''lists of best-selling individual books and book series''' to date and in any language. ''"Best selling"'' refers to the estimated number of copies sold of each book, rather than the number of books printed or currently owned. [[Comic book|Comics]] and [[textbook]]s are not included in this list. The books are listed according to the highest sales estimate as reported in reliable, independent sources. This list is incomplete because there are many books, such as ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas]], or ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]], that are commonly cited as "best-selling books" yet have no reliable sales figures. Similarly, many notable book series that sold very widely are poorly documented ([[Land of Oz]]) or consist of multiple sub-series ([[Tom Swift]]).

According to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as of 1995, the [[Bible]] is the best-selling book of all time, with an estimated 5{{nbsp}}billion copies sold and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best selling book of non-fiction|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/best-selling-book-of-non-fiction|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=15 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315025558/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/best-selling-book-of-non-fiction|archivedate=15 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Qur'an]] is also widely reported to be one of the most printed and distributed books worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}  The ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung]]'', also known as the ''Little Red Book'', has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures — with some sources claiming over 6.5 billion printed volumes,&lt;ref&gt;Zhengyuan Fu, ''Autocratic Tradition and Chinese Politics'', Cambridge University Press 1994, p. 186.

*''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is considered by many to be a single book{{fact|date=January 2018}}, because it was written and planned by the author to be such. It is written in the preface to many editions that the book is sometimes 'erroneously' referred to as a trilogy, and goes on to state that it is one book in three volumes. Some people consider it to instead be a trilogy or series of three books, because it was originally published as a series of three volumes: ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ''[[The Two Towers]]'', and ''[[The Return of the King]]''.

|[[The Little Prince|''Le Petit Prince'' (''The Little Prince'')]] || [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]] || French{{#tag:ref|
Some confusion and controversy is commonly attached to the publication data for ''Le Petit Prince''. Saint-Exupéry, its author, spoke almost no English and wrote exclusively in French. His handwritten (and almost illegible) French manuscript was converted by his secretary into a French typescript, which he submitted to his New York City publisher Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in late 1942, which was then translated to English by their own translator. The story was first published in New York City in English in April 1943, followed a week later by its French counterpart. It was also licensed for publication in other countries by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock before being published by Saint-Exupéry's normal publisher in France after the end of the Second World War. ''Le Petit Prince'' would not be published in France until its liberation, with Gallimard's first French printing in November 1945, which they say they did not release for sale until 1946. In approximately 1947 Gallimard sued Reynal &amp; Hitchcock claiming it had an 'exclusive' publishing agreement with Saint-Exupéry (who was killed during the war), and later reached a rights agreement with them.|group = "Note"}} || 1943 || 140 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/little-prince-discovery-offers-new-insight-into-classic-book-1.1310195|title='Little Prince' discovery offers new insight into classic book|author=THOMAS ADAMSON (Associated Press)|work=thetimes-tribune.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202095913/http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/little-prince-discovery-offers-new-insight-into-classic-book-1.1310195|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3025693/why-the-little-prince-is-actually-a-new-york-classic#3|title=Why "The Little Prince" Is Actually A New York Classic|work=Co.Create|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523021559/http://www.fastcocreate.com/3025693/why-the-little-prince-is-actually-a-new-york-classic#3|archivedate=2016-05-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|| fiction (novel)

=== Notes ===
&lt;!--There are great differences between the number of the books published in each series. For example, although the ''[[Perry Rhodan]]'' series and the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series have each sold more books than the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series or ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', they also have had more individual books published in their series. The ''Perry Rhodan'' series has released over 2,350 books and the ''Star Wars'' series has released over two hundred, but the ''Harry Potter'' and ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' series have only seven each. Thus, the ''Harry Potter'' series has over 50 million copies sold for every book, while the ''Perry Rhodan'' series has sold less than half a million per book, and the ''Star Wars'' series has sold just over three million per book. --&gt;

The ''[[Perry Rhodan]]'' series has sold more than 1 billion copies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perry-rhodan-usa.com/web1998/rdnpres.htm Perry Rhodan 35th anniversary Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430072534/http://www.perry-rhodan-usa.com/web1998/rdnpres.htm |date=April 30, 2008 }} (July 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; but is not listed because that figure includes [[Pulp magazine|magazine]] sales, not novels alone.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}  Similarly, the ''[[Jerry Cotton]]'' series has sold over 300 million copies, but most of these were in magazine format.&lt;ref name="German"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoehr|first=Ingo Roland|title=German literature of the twentieth century|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|year=2001|series=History of German Literature|volume=10|page=529|isbn=978-1-57113-157-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Vi3vz7qbtwC&amp;pg=PA258&amp;dq=%22million+copies%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1995&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=0vNCS_HVCpzWyATF6vD-Bw&amp;cd=10#v=onepage&amp;q=%22million%20copies%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 January 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102073440/http://books.google.com/books?id=7Vi3vz7qbtwC&amp;pg=PA258&amp;dq=%22million+copies%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1995&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=0vNCS_HVCpzWyATF6vD-Bw&amp;cd=10#v=onepage&amp;q=%22million%20copies%22&amp;f=false|archivedate=2 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lurkmore''' or '''Lurkomorye''' ({{lang-ru|Луркоморье}}, a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[Lukomorye]]'' and the English online slang ''"[[:wikt:lurk|lurk]] [[:wikt:moar|moar]]"'') is an informal [[Russian language|Russian-language]] [[MediaWiki]]-powered [[online encyclopedia]]  focusing on Internet subcultures, folklore, and [[internet meme|memes]].&lt;ref name="Описaниe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lurkmore.ru/Lurkmore:Описание |title=Lurkmore: Описание |trans-title=Lurkmore: Description |publisher=Lurkmore.ru |accessdate=2009-04-18 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 16, 2017, Lurkmore contains 7598 articles.&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lurkmore.ru/Служебная:Statistics |title=Statistics |publisher=lurkmore.ru |accessdate=2010-12-09 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most popular humor—as well as internet-meme-related—websites of the [[Internet in Russia|Russian Internet]].&lt;ref name="pcmag"&gt;{{cite web |date=3 November 2008 |url=http://www.pcmag.ru/internet/detail.php?ID=31648 |title=RE: lurkmour.ru |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=2010-02-11 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and style==

Lurkmore was started as a knowledge base of [[Internet meme]]s centered on 2ch.ru, the first popular Russian-language [[imageboard]]. With time, the project evolved to encompass the broader [[Runet]] subculture. It has been called an "informal encyclopedia" about everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yaca.yandex.ru/yca/cat/Reference/Encyclopedias/ |script-title=ru:Яндекс:Каталог: Энциклопедии |trans-title=Yandex Catalog: Encyclopedias |language=Russian |publisher=Яндекс.Каталог |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Lurkmore comprises a wide range of articles, but a very considerable share of them is still about the Internet culture.

Lurkmore articles use a distinctive style, distinguishing themselves with a general informality, semiseriousness, sarcasm, the free use of foul language, and impudence, as well as by sharp criticism of the shortcomings of the considered phenomena. The articles are also characterized by a specific slang—"lurkoyaz" (луркояз)—consisting of Internet slang, assorted words used by [[Padonkaffsky jargon|padonki]] and [[Kashchenism|Kashchenists]], and Lurkmore's own neologisms.

==Rules and policies==
{{quote|Our rules are very simple and comprehensible.

==Audience==
A remarkable feature of the project is the concealment of IP addresses of anonymous participants in the editing history of articles for all users except administrators. The inscription of "Anonimus" is displayed instead of an IP address. The registered participants having a flag of the autoconfirmed participant also have an opportunity to leave any editing not under the name, and anonymously.

'''MarcEdit''' is a [[metadata]] editing [[software suite]] used primarily to create and manipulate [[MARC standards|MARC records]].  Originally developed by Terry Reese in 1999 for a major database cleanup project at [[Oregon State University]], the software was subsequently released for wider use in the [[Library and information science|LIS field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reese|first1=Terry|title=About MarcEdit|url=http://marcedit.reeset.net/about-marcedit|website=MarcEdit Development|accessdate=22 August 2016|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, it was used in 143 different countries.&lt;ref name="purposeful"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reese|first1=Terry|title=Purposeful Development:  Being Ready When Your Project Moves From ‘Hobby’ to Mission Critical|journal=Code4Lib|date=3 February 2012|issue=16|url=http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/6393|issn=1940-5758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use cases==
* MarcEdit can be used with [[XSLT]] to retrieve records from remote servers via [[Z39.50]] and then map their contents to another metadata schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tripathi|first1=Aditya|title=Metadata Crosswalks with MarcEdit using XSLT|date=1 January 2003|url=http://drtc.isibang.ac.in/ldl/handle/1849/127|accessdate=22 August 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Catalogers who wish to read and write records in [[Worldcat]] can do so using MarcEdit's implementation of the OCLC Worldcat API to read and write records in [[Worldcat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reese|first1=Terry|title=Opening the Door: A First Look at the OCLC WorldCat Metadata API|journal=Code4Lib|date=21 July 2014|issue=25|url=http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/9863|accessdate=22 August 2016|issn=1940-5758}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* MarcEdit can be used to batch-edit [[authority control|authority records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finn|first1=Mary|title=Batch-Load Authority Control Cleanup Using MarcEdit and LTI|journal=Technical Services Quarterly|date=4 December 2008|volume=26|issue=1|pages=44–50|doi=10.1080/07317130802225605}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* MarcEdit can add dereferencable [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]] to bibliographic records that use [[authority control]] that uniquely identify the relevant authority record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shieh|first1=Jackie|last2=Reese|first2=Terry|title=The Importance of Identifiers in the New Web Environment and Using the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) in Subfield Zero ($0): A Small Step That Is Actually a Big Step|journal=Journal of Library Metadata|date=25 January 2016|volume=15|issue=3–4|pages=208–226|doi=10.1080/19386389.2015.1099981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 2008, the idea behind the Met Breuer project was initiated by philanthropist [[Leonard Lauder]]. An agreement between the Met and the Whitney was signed, after three years of negotiation, in 2011.&lt;ref name=NYorker-BreuerOpening-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tomkins|first1=Calvin|title=The Met and the Now|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/25/the-met-and-the-now|accessdate=23 April 2016|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location opened in March 2016 following a year and a half of preparations as part of a $600 million [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] renovation plan.

== Reception ==
{{Quote box|quote=But the Met is huge and old, with a history of treating contemporary art as an afterthought.

In advance of the Met Breuer's opening, art critic at ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[Roberta Smith]] wrote that the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other major art institutions [[fear of missing out|feared to miss out]] as the rest of the [[art world]] displayed more contemporary art exhibitions. Smith said that the Met excelled at "bringing older art to life" and that the Met Breuer's cautious opening exhibit showed unclear goals for the new building.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-EarlyLookOpening-2016 /&gt; ''[[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper]]'' cited the renovations involved in the opening as being more representative of Breuer's design for the building, with a lower level sunken garden and a more welcoming emphasis on the sculptural design.&lt;ref name=Wallpaper-DesignAward-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murg|first1=Stephanie|title=Architecture.

In '''''Minister of Law and Order v Kadir''''', an important 1994 case in both the [[South African law of delict]] and [[South African criminal law]], the police had failed to collect information which would have enabled the seriously injured respondent to pursue a [[civil law (common law)|civil claim]] against the driver of the other vehicle. The Minister raised an exception, contending that there was no legal duty on the police to collect such information. The court ''a quo'' dismissed this argument, finding that the community would consider otherwise. On appeal, however, it was held that society understood that police functions relate to criminal matters—they are not designed to assist civil litigants—and would baulk at the idea of holding policemen personally liable for damages arising out of a relatively insignificant dereliction. The respondent, therefore, had not proved a legal duty.

'''Codex 2427''' (in the [[Biblical manuscript#Gregory-Aland|Gregory-Aland]] numbering), formerly known as '''Archaic Mark''', is a miniature manuscript of the [[Gospel of Mark]] written in [[Lower case|minuscule]] [[Greek language|Greek]]. The manuscript had been very difficult to date [[Palaeography|paleographically]] and had been assigned to the 13th-18th century, until 2006 when it was proved a [[art forgery|forgery]] following the publication of digital images of the codex, which had been made available online to renew interest in the manuscript.

The codex is written in a tiny [[Lower case|minuscule]] hand on parchment leaves, containing 44 leaves (11.5&amp;nbsp;cm by 8.5&amp;nbsp;cm), written in one column per page, 21-25 lines per page. The codex has no sections, canons or headings, but it contains 16 colour illuminations.&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Mitchell, P. A. Duncan, Chicago’s “Archaic Mark” (MS 2427): A Reintroduction to its Enigmas and a Fresh Collation of its Readings, Novum Testamentum, XLVIII, 1 (2006), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no indications on the codex that it was originally part of a tetraevangelium. The codex includes text of [[Mark 16|Mark 16:9-20]].&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Mitchell, P. A. Duncan, Chicago’s “Archaic Mark” (MS 2427): A Reintroduction to its Enigmas and a Fresh Collation of its Readings, Novum Testamentum, XLVIII, 1 (2006), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The codex 2427 was found among the possessions of John Askitopoulos, an Athenian collector and dealer of antiquities, after his death in 1917. In 1937 the manuscript was sent to the [[University of Chicago Library]], where it still resides (Ms. 972).&lt;ref name = Aland&gt;{{Cite book

Illustrations are very similar to those from [[Minuscule 777 (Gregory-Aland)|minuscule 777]]. Robert S. Nelson suggested that they were copied from 777.&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Mitchell, P. A. Duncan, Chicago’s “Archaic Mark” (MS 2427): A Reintroduction to its Enigmas and a Fresh Collation of its Readings, Novum Testamentum, XLVIII, 1 (2006), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaic Mark ==
The text has some omissions (Mark 7:2-5, 8:11b, 13:28b-29, 10:29 is shorter). All these omissions have parallels in other Gospels, and for some scholars they look like non-interpolations, although they are not supported by any other manuscript.

The Greek text of the codex was a leading representative of the [[Alexandrian text-type]]. It was recognized by [[Ernest Cadman Colwell]] (1901-1974) as having an extraordinary degree of correspondence with the [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]]. According to Colwell the codex preserved a "primitive text" of the Gospel of Mark.&lt;ref&gt;E.C. Colwell, ''An Ancient Text of the Gospel of Mark, The Emory University'', Quarterly 1 (1945), pp. 65-75; E.C. Colwell, ''Some Unusual Abbreviations in ms. 2427'', Studia evangelica, ed. K. Aland, F.L. Cross, T &amp; U 73, Berlin 1959, pp. 778-779.&lt;/ref&gt; Text of the codex was highly esteemed by [[Theodore Cressy Skeat|T. C. Skeat]]. [[Kurt Aland]] placed it in [[Categories of New Testament manuscripts#Category I|Category I]].&lt;ref name = Aland/&gt; It was collated by M. M. Mitchell and P. A. Duncan in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;M. M.

The manuscript found some early critics upon arriving in Chicago. Robert P. Casey "voiced his suspicion in 1947".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen C. Carlson, [http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=577 "Archaic Mark" (MS 2427) and the Finding of a Manuscript Fake] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 Mary V. Orna found that one of the illustrations contained [[Prussian blue]] (KFe[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]), produced since 1704 only.&lt;ref&gt;Mary V. Orna, ''Applications of Infrared Microspectroscopy to Art Historical Questions about Medieval Manuscripts'', Archaeological Chemistry, 4 (1988), pp. 270-288.&lt;/ref&gt; This did not resolve the question of authenticity, however, as it was "conceivable that the illuminations could have been retouched in a naïve attempt at restoration."&lt;ref name="Carlson 2006a"&gt;Carlson 2006a&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2006 the [[University of Chicago]] announced that digital images of the manuscript had appeared online in an effort to "foster further research."&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell and Duncan 2006&lt;/ref&gt; By February Stephen Carlson had announced his findings that the codex was a forgery, and proved his case beyond a doubt at the 2006 Annual Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2006a"/&gt; Its text has been copied from [[Philipp Buttmann]]'s 1860 Greek New Testament edition (based on Cardinal [[Angelo Mai|Mai's]] edition of [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/novumtestamentu01tiscgoog#page/n5/mode/2up ''Novum Testamentum Graece''], ed. Ph. Buttman, 5th edition, (Leipzig 1878)&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially obvious since the forger also followed Buttmann in 81 out of 85 places where his edition departed from the Codex Vaticanus text. Furthermore, in three places the copyist of 2427 had accidentally omitted a line (6:2, 8:12, 14:14), and it transpired that in each verse the omitted text corresponds exactly to the lineation of Buttmann's edition.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen C. Carlson, The Nineteenth-Century Exemplar of “Archaic Mark” (MS 2427), SBL 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, microscopic, chemical and codicological testing eventually proved in 2009 that the manuscript had been made in 1874 at the earliest.&lt;ref&gt;“Chicago’s ‘Archaic Mark’ (ms 2427) II: Microscopic, Chemical and Codicological Analysis Confirms Modern Production” (with Joseph G. Barabe and Abigail B. Quandt). Novum Testamentum 52 (2010) 101-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

What made the text a forgery was that it was carefully manufactured in the style of a medieval codex, when it was in fact a very recent creation, no older than the late 19th century. What originally made scholars so suspicious was that it was textually the closest known manuscript – in fact, virtually identical – to Codex Vaticanus, but of a much later date. Furthermore, Greek codices of a single gospel are extremely unusual, further contributing to the suspicion that it was made as a souvenir.

[[Peru]]'s '''Movimiento Etnocacerista''' (aka '''Movimiento Nacionalista Peruano''' or "Peruvian Nationalist Movement") is a group of [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalists]].
The name ''etnocacerista'' is composed of two parts: the first evokes Peru's [[Ethnicity|ethnic identity]] (specifically, its origins with the [[Quechua people|Quechua]], a [[Native American (Americas)|Native American]] people often identified in the popular imagination with the [[Inca]], a pre-Columbian royal group); the second indicates the group's veneration of 19th century [[President of Peru|president]] and war hero [[Andrés Avelino Cáceres]], who led a guerrilla resistance campaign against occupying [[Chile]]an troops during the [[War of the Pacific]].

Most of its members are armed forces veterans of [[Internal conflict in Peru|Peru's internal war]] or the border disputes with [[Ecuador]] in the 1980s and 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

'''''North Star''''' is a derelict wooden horse-drawn icebreaker built in 1868 and was used to clear a way through the ice when the canals were frozen. 

It is now owned by the [[Black Country Living Museum]], where it is based and can be seen dockside in the Lord Ward’s Canal Arm at the [[Black Country Living Museum]] in Dudley.

[[File:PAM Parian Chronicle 2870.jpg|thumb|Detail from the shorter fragment base of the stele, found in 1897, that is in a museum on Paros. It contains chronicle entries for the years 336&amp;ndash;299 BC.]]
The '''Parian Chronicle''' or '''Parian Marble''' ({{lang-la|Marmor Parium}}, &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|abbr.|abbreviated}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''Mar. Par.''') is a [[ancient Greece|Greek]] [[chronology]], covering the years from 1582 BC to 299 BC,&lt;!--NB: this reference directly concerns the years--&gt; inscribed on a [[stele]]. Found on the island of [[Paros]] in two sections, and sold in [[Smyrna]] in the early 17th century to an agent for [[Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel]], this inscription was deciphered by [[John Selden]] and published among the [[Arundel Marbles]], ''Marmora Arundelliana'' (London 1628-9) nos. 1–14, 59–119.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8E0VAAAAQAAJ&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Marmora Arundelliana...|last=Selden|first=John|date=1629|publisher=Joh. Bill|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of the sections published by Selden has subsequently disappeared. A further third fragment of this inscription, comprising the base of the stele and containing the end of the text, was found on Paros in 1897. It has entries from 336/35 to 299/98 BC.

The two known upper fragments, brought to London in 1627 and presented to [[Oxford University]] in 1667, include entries for the years 1582/81&amp;ndash;355/54 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.museum/ash/faqs/q004/ Ashmolean Museum: transcriptions and translations]&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving upper chronicle fragment currently resides in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at Oxford. It combines dates for events which modern readers would consider [[myth]]ic, such as the [[Deucalion|Flood of Deucalion]] (equivalent to 1529/28 BC) with dates we would categorize as historic. For the Greeks, the events of their distant past, such as the [[Trojan War]] (dated from 1217 to 1208 BC in the Parian inscription) and the [[Argonautica|Voyage of the Argonauts]] were ''historic'': their myths were understood as [[legend]]s to the Greeks. In fact the Parian inscriptions spend more detail on the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]] than on certifiably historic events closer to the date the [[stele]] was inscribed and erected, apparently during 264/263 BC. "The Parian Marble uses chronological specificity as a guarantee of truth," Peter Green observed in the introduction to his annotated translation of the ''Argonautica'' of [[Apollonios Rhodios]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Argonautika of Apollonios Rhodios |last=Green |first=Peter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0-520-25393-3 |page=30 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the mythic past was rooted in historical time, its legends treated as fact, its heroic protagonists seen as links between the 'age of origins' and the mortal, everyday world that succeeded it."&lt;ref&gt;Green (2007), p. 14, noting {{cite book |chapter=Myth and history: history and the historical interpretation of myth |title=Approaches to Greek Myth |last=Brillante |first=C. |authorlink= |editor=Edmunds, L. |year=1991 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-8018-3863-0 |page= |pages=91–140 (esp. pp 101f.) |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shorter fragment base of the stele, found in 1897, is in the [[Archaeological museum of Paros]]. It contains chronicle entries for the years 336/35&amp;ndash;299/98 BC.

==Sources of the Parian Chronicle==

The major analysis of the ''Parian Chronicle'' is that of [[Felix Jacoby]], written in the early 20th century. This appeared in two works: his book ''Das Marmor Parium'' published in 1904,&lt;ref&gt;Felix Jacoby, ''Das Marmor Parium'' (Berlin: Weidmannsche Buchhandlung, 1904).&lt;/ref&gt; and as a part of the ''[[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker]]'', first published in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Jacoby,’’Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker’’ II B (Leiden: Brill, 1997 reprint) pp. 992&amp;ndash;1005; Kommentar II B (Leiden: Brill reprint, 1993) pp. 665&amp;ndash;702.(&lt;/ref&gt; There has been no major study devoted to the entire stele since that time, although a few authors have dealt with specific time periods covered in the tablet. Furthermore, there apparently have been no critical studies of the original text on the stele itself since the work of Jacoby, as evidenced by the fact that the display of the Greek text on the Ashmolean Web site is a photocopy of the text that Jacoby published in his ''Fragmente''.

In attempting to discern the source or sources of the ''Chronicle'', Jacoby followed the rather subjective method that was popular in the late 19th and early 20th century, whereby a change in the subject matter or style of writing was taken to imply a different source. The style of the ''Chronicle'', however, is quite uniform. Events are listed with little embellishment, and the primary purpose seems to be to give for each event the name of the king or archon ruling in Athens at the time, along with the number of years prior to the base date of the tablet (264/63 BC). The only exceptions are that in nine out of the 107 extant entries, the name of the archon or king is no longer readable, and in 14 entries the number of elapsed years is similarly effaced. The lack of embellishment is shown, for example, in the entry for [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], which attributes nothing remarkable to him or to his reign, even though in later Greek mythology he was a semi-human creature. The ''Chronicle’s'' entries for [[Deucalion]], who became the center of many flood-myths, are more consistent with the earliest Greek legends that merely state that he fled from a flooding river in his native Lycoreia near the [[Gulf of Corinth]], arriving at Athens where his son later became king.

In contrast to Jacoby’s ideas, a 2012 study maintains that the style of the  ''Chronicle’s'' entries suggests that the ultimate source of the information in the ''Parian Chronicle'' was the archives of the city of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger C. Young and Andrew E. Steinmann, “Correlation of Select Classical Sources Related to the Trojan War with Assyrian and Biblical Chronologies” ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 1.2 (2012), pp. 223&amp;ndash;48.[http://jesot.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/JESOT-1.2-Young-Steinmann.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Authors Rodger Young and [[Andrew Steinmann]] base their views on three key inferences from the available evidence. 1) The naming of the reigning king or archon in Athens for each entry is consistent with an Athenian provenance of the material. 2) The source behind each entry must have provided a year-number from which the author of the ''Parian Chronicle'' was able to calculate the years to his own time, thus suggesting that the archives from which the information was taken were keeping track of the years since the founding of the kingship in Athens under Cecrops. Such framing chronicles are known to have been kept in Rome: the ''[[Ab urbe condita|Anno Urbis Conditae]],'' from which events were reckoned. 3) The annalistic style of the ''Chronicle'' is in keeping with the genre of annalistic records such as the [[Eponym dating system|Assyrian Eponym Canon]], in which the purpose was not so much to describe events as to give an accurate record of when the events occurred, as related to the years since the founding of the kingship and also tying the event to the king or archon who was currently reigning.

Young and Steinmann acknowledge several factors&lt;ref&gt;Young and Steinmann, "Correlation of Select Classical Sources," p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; that make it less plausible the source behind the ''Parian Chronicle'' was the state archives of Athens. The first is that there are no known examples of writing from Athens that date as early as 1582/81 BC, the date of the ''Chronicle’s'' first entry. The earliest extant writing in Greek from any area is found in the syllabic [[Linear B]] script, for which the earliest instances date to about a century and a half after the reputed beginning of the kingship under Cecrops. Another argument against the Athenian provenance of the information in the ''Parian Chronicle'' is the reconstruction given by Jacoby&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby, ''Fragmente'' 2B, pp. 98&amp;ndash;99.&lt;/ref&gt; of the first two lines of the tablet, which were largely effaced when [[John Selden|Selden]] made his copy (this top part has since been lost), but of which enough remained that Selden could determine that it was intended as a statement of the source of the tablet’s histories. Jacoby’s restoration of Selden’s Greek text is followed on the Ashmolean Web site, which translates it into English as follows, with square brackets and italics indicating the portion of the text that is conjectural:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[''From''] al[''l the records and general accounts''] I have recorded [''the previous times''], beginning from Cecrops becoming first king of Athens, until [____]uanax was archon in Paros, and Diognetus in Athens.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The critical word here is “general,” which represents a Greek original for which Selden could read only the last three letters, νῶν; these are the ending of the genitive plural. Jacoby hypothesized the word was an adjective and restored it to κοινῶν, meaning “common, general, ordinary”. This is consistent with Jacoby’s theory for the source of the ''Chronicle’s'' documents, namely that the author used a variety of selections from diverse materials available in the third century BC. The Ashmolean Web site then translated this into English as shown above. Young and Steinmann, however, maintain that “The writer of an annalistic history that professes to give exact dates for events would not assure readers of his credibility by saying that his information was derived from the “common” folklore ... For the Parian Marble, such reassurance would be given if the original word, for which the genitive plural ending - νῶν has survived, was not κοινῶν, but Ἀθηνῶν,”&lt;ref&gt;Young and Steinmann, "Correlation of Select Classical Sources," p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. “of Athens,” taking the word as a noun (Athens was a plural noun in classical Greek). This restoration would give the reader the assurance that the writer of the tablet had an authoritative source for his information, as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[''From''] al[''l the public records and histories of Ath'']ens I have recorded [''the previous times''], beginning from Cecrops becoming first king of Athens, until [____]uanax was archon in Paros, and Diognetus in Athens.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One other conjecture for the source of the ''Parian Chronicle’s'' information is of historical interest. In 1788, [[Joseph Robertson (clergyman)|Joseph Robertson]] went to considerable length in arguing that the tablets were of relatively recent date and entirely fraudulent. His book is accessible under the External links below. The finding of the bottom portion of the tablet on Páros in 1897 has made Robertson’s theory untenable.

==RTI scanning==
In 2013, Ben Altshuler of the [[Institute for Digital Archaeology]] oversaw [[Polynomial texture mapping|reflectance transformation imaging]] (RTI) of the Parian Marble, revealing significant, previously illegible text.&lt;ref name=IDA&gt;{{cite web|title=The Parian Marble at The Ashmolean Museum|url=http://digitalarchaeology.org.uk/projects|website=Institute for Digital Archaeology|publisher=IDA|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
The '''''Peiwen Yunfu''''' ({{zh|t=佩文韻府|s=佩文韵府|p=Pèiwén Yùnfǔ| w=P'ei-wen Yün-fu|l=rime storehouse of esteemed phrases}}) is a 1711 [[China|Chinese]] [[rime dictionary]] of literary allusions and poetic dictions. Collated by [[tone name|tone]] and [[syllable rime|rime]], the dictionary serves the composition of poetry.

Like the ''[[Kangxi dictionary]]'', the ''Peiwen Yunfu'' was compiled under the patronage of the [[Kangxi Emperor]], whose imperial library was named Peiwen ("esteem/admire writing/phrases/literature"). He believed that previous Chinese dictionaries of multiple-character phrases, including the [[Yuan Dynasty]] ''Yunfu qunyu'' 韻府群玉 and the [[Ming Dynasty]]  ''Wuche yunrui'' 五車韻瑞, were incomplete and sometimes erroneous. Over twenty editors, including Zhang Yushu (張玉書, 1642-1711) and Chen Tingjing (陳廷敬, 1638-1712), began the compilation in 1704 and finished in 1711. In 1716, the emperor ordered the creation of a supplement, the ''Yunfu shiyi'' 韻府拾遺, which was completed in 1720.

The ''Peiwen yunfu'' is a large dictionary (212 卷 "volumes; fascicles") of two-, three-, and [[four-character idioms]]. It contains roughly 560,000 items under 10,257 entries arranged by 106 rhymes. Classical allusions and phrases are classified under the rhyme of their last character, with numerous quotations given to illustrate usage.

Although the ''Peiwen yunfu'', which [[James Legge]] calls the "Kangxi Thesaurus",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | given = James | surname = Legge | author-link = James Legge | title = The Chinese Classics, vol. 1: Confucian Analects | edition = 2nd | location = Oxford | publisher = Clarendon Press | year = 1893 | url = https://archive.org/details/chineseclassics01mencgoog#page/n155/mode/1up | page = 135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is less famous than the ''Kangxi dictionary'', it can be helpful in tracing literary usages. "Whenever names or phrases are met with which are not understood," say Teng and Biggerstaff, "this is the first work which should be consulted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | surname1 = Teng | given1 = Ssu-yü | surname2 = Biggerstaff | given2 = Knight | year = 1971 | title = An Annotated Bibliography of Selected Chinese Reference Works | edition = 3rd | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Harvard University Press | isbn = 0-674-03851-7 | page = 97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''President of the Republic of South Africa and Others v M &amp; G Media Ltd''''' is an important case in [[South African administrative law]]. It concerned a report by two senior judges who were asked by the President of the Republic to visit [[Zimbabwe]] shortly before its [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2002|presidential election in 2002]]. "Surprisingly,"&lt;ref&gt;Hoexter ''Administrative Law'' 100.&lt;/ref&gt; instead of confirming an order to release the report, a majority of the Constitutional Court resorted to section 80 of the Promotion of Access to Information Act&lt;ref&gt;Act 2 of 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; (PAIA) and remitted the matter to the [[High Court of South Africa|High Court]] for it to examine the report in secret and make a determination.

'''Press videoconferencing''' is an international press conference using [[videoconferencing]] (a form of [[teleconference]]) over the Internet. Journalists can participate in an International press conference from anywhere without leaving their offices or their countries. They need only appear in front of a computer connected to the Internet via [[videotelephony|video link]] and ask their questions to the speaker by using a microphone to joint the discussion.

This concept was developed in October 2007 by WEBOconference, a videoconferencing service provider and the PanAfrican Press Association (APPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presseafricaine.info/article-la-presse-africaine-accede-a-la-videoconference-avec-le-concours-de-weboconference--38193130.html|title=APPA|date=2007-10-21|publisher=WEBOconference PressVideoconference|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912010834/http://www.presseafricaine.info/article-la-presse-africaine-accede-a-la-videoconference-avec-le-concours-de-weboconference--38193130.html|archivedate=2012-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow African journalists to participate in international press conferences on the subject of development and [[good governance]].

In February 2009, the African Press Organization’s Secretary-General, [[Nicolas Pompigne-Mognard]], has declared that his [[non-governmental organization]] was anticipating a significant increase in demands for international press videoconferences because of the global economics crisis which limit journalists in their ability to find time and resources to travel.

The '''Ringelblum Archive''' is a collection of documents from the [[World War II]] [[Warsaw Ghetto]], collected and preserved by the group known under code name '''Oyneg Shabbos''' (in [[Modern Hebrew|Modern Israeli Hebrew]]: '''Oneg Shabbat''', {{lang-he|עונג שבת}}), led by [[Jew]]ish historian Dr. [[Emanuel Ringelblum]].  The group, which included historians, writers, rabbis and social workers, was dedicated to chronicling life in the Ghetto during the [[Nazi occupation of Poland|German occupation]]. They worked as a team, collecting documents and soliciting testimonies and reports from dozens of volunteers of all ages. The materials submitted included essays, diaries, drawings, wall posters and other materials describing life in the Ghetto. The collection work started in September 1939 and ended in January 1943.

Today the discovered part of the collection, which contains about 6,000 documents (about 35,000 pages),&lt;ref name="USHMMM"/&gt; is housed at the [[Jewish Historical Institute]] in Warsaw.&lt;ref name=holo&gt;[http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/ghettos/ringleblum.html Emanuel Ringelblum: The Creator of “Oneg Shabbat”] Holocaust Research Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''Oneg Shabbat'' means ''joy of the Sabbath'' in [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] and usually refers to a celebratory gathering held after [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] services, often with food, singing, study, discussion, and socializing. This name was selected because the group tended to meet on Shabbat to discuss the progress of their collection and documentation efforts. The form ''Oyneg Shabbos'' is [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazic]] pronunciation.

==History==
[[File:EmanuelRingelblum 1900-1944.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Historian [[Emanuel Ringelblum]] who started the project and after whom it is also called "Ringelblum Archives".]]

The members of Oyneg Shabbos initially collected the material with the intention that they would write a book after the war about the horrors they had witnessed. As the pace of deportations increased, and it became clear that the destination was the [[Treblinka]] [[death camp]] and few Jewish Varsovians were likely to survive, Ringelblum had the archives stored in three milk cans and ten metal boxes, which were then buried in three places in the Ghetto. Two of the canisters, containing thousands of documents, were unearthed on 18 September 1946 and a further ten boxes on 1 December 1950. The third cache is rumored to be buried beneath what is now the Chinese Embassy in [[Warsaw]] but a search in 2005 failed to locate the missing archival material.&lt;ref name=holo/&gt;
[[File:Skrzynki i bańki po mleku Archiwum Ringelbluma.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Three boxes and two milk cans used to store the archive]]
On January 19, 1942, an escaped inmate from the [[Chelmno extermination camp]], [[Jacob Grojanowski]], reached the Warsaw Ghetto, where he gave detailed information about the camp to the Oneg Shabbat group. His report, which became known as the ''[[Grojanowski Report]]'', was smuggled out of the ghetto through the channels of the Polish underground, reached London and was published by June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%202494.pdf Chelmno], Yad Vashem&lt;/ref&gt;

All but three members of the Oyneg Shabbos were murdered in the genocides. Emanuel Ringelblum escaped the ghetto, but continued to return to work on the archives. In 1944 Ringelblum and his family were discovered and were executed along with those who hid them.&lt;ref name="Gilbert02"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Gilbert|title=The Routledge Atlas of the Holocaust  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYs5OSnsrHwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Routledge+atlas+of+the+Holocaust#v=onepage&amp;q=%20Ringelblum&amp;f=falsee|year=2002|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=978-0-415-28145-4|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, [[Rokhl Auerbakh]], one of the three surviving members of Oyneg Shabes, initiated the search for and excavation of the buried chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/2916940/Rachel_Auerbuch_Yad_Vashem_and_Israeli_Holocaust_Memory|title=Rachel Auerbach, Yad Vashem, and Israeli Holocaust Memory|first=Boaz|last=Cohen|authorlink=Boaz Cohen|publisher=academia.edu|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/node/13272068|title=From Beyond the Grave|date=12 March 2009|accessdate=18 December 2016|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1999, the Emanuel Ringelblum Archives were listed on the [[Memory of the World Register]] by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warsaw Ghetto Archives (Emanuel Ringelblum Archives)|website=Memory of the World|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-9/warsaw-ghetto-archives-emanuel-ringelblum-archives/|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A catalog of the Ringelblum Archive was published in book form in 2009 by the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] and the [[Jewish Historical Institute]], Warsaw; and the entire archive is also available to researchers in digital format at both institutions.&lt;ref name="USHMMM"/&gt; The Jewish Historical Institute has published a book series of 10 volumes summarizing parts of the archive as follows: (1) Letters concerning the Holocaust (2) Children — covert teaching in the Warsaw Ghetto (3) Accounts from [[Kresy]] (4) Life and work of [[Gela Seksztajn]] (5) The [[Warsaw Ghetto]] (6) The General Governatore (7) Legacies (8) Territories annexed to the Reich (9) Territories annexed to the Reich (10) Fate of Jews from [[Łódź]] (1939–1942).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book series Ringelblum Archive|url=http://www.jhi.pl/en/projects/book-series-rigelblum-archive|publisher=Jewish Historical Institute|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, historian [[Samuel Kassow]] published ''Who Will Write Our History? Emanuel Ringelblum, the Warsaw Ghetto, and the Oyneg Shabbes Archive'' listing all accounts of the Oyneg Shabes archives that have been found.

'''''Sam's Strip''''' was a humorous [[comic strip]] created and produced by [[Mort Walker]] and [[Jerry Dumas]]. It was distributed by [[King Features Syndicate]] from October 1961 to June 1963. The series depended heavily on [[meta-joke|metahumor]], and appearances by famous comic-strip characters.

==Overview==
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Mort Walker and Jerry Dumas would meet on Monday mornings to go over the gag ideas they had worked up for future installments of Walker's strips ''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' and ''[[Hi and Lois]]''. Just for fun, they started putting their considerable knowledge of comic-strip history to use in creating gags about characters from different strips and time periods meeting and interacting. An idea eventually came out of these exercises: What about a feature starring a guy who runs his own comic strip as a business? Walker, a fan of [[alliteration]], came up with the title ''Sam's Strip''. They split the gag writing, Dumas did the drawing, and Walker the lettering. When the pair took samples to Walker's regular distributor, King Features Syndicate, four executives barraged them with questions ahout the contents, but there was enough laughter that the editor finally gave the go-ahead.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;Sam's Strip: The Comic About Comics, Mort Walker and Jerry Dumas, Fantagraphics Books, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sam's Strip'' debuted as a daily only on October 16, 1961.&lt;ref name="cbr"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chad Nevett|title=Sam’s Strip: The Comic about Comics|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=February 22, 2009|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&amp;id=752|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulb-nosed, seemingly neckless Sam owned and operated the comic strip he inhabited, and both he and his bespectacled, unnamed assistant were aware of their fictional, artistic status. They commented on the elements of cartooning, talked to the readers, abused their artist (a fictionalized Dumas), and played with the stock in their Cartoon Prop Closet (which contained everything from idea bulbs and flying money to pain stars and angry thought bubbles), all the while trying any scheme to make their business a success. Along the way, they encountered strip stars such as [[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]] and [[Charlie Brown]], cult favorites like [[Krazy Kat]] and Ignatz Mouse, and old-timers such as [[Happy Hooligan]] and [[Tillie the Toiler]]. Dumas took pride in drawing each character's style exactly (there were no good copy machines at the time), but the job was intensely time-consuming. It took him three weeks to create a week's continuity about a comic characters convention that featured dozens of "guest stars."&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

This metahumor made fans of cartoonists and informed comics aficionados (and some editors), but the reading public was left scratching its collective head. As Walker admitted later, "the readers had to be familiar with the various characters we were [[Satire|satirizing]] before they could get the gag. It's a tough sell."&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; Just as Sam struggled to make his strip a hit, his creators did the same, and ''Sam's Strip'' never gained more than sixty newspapers before being cancelled on June 1, 1963.&lt;ref name="cbr" /&gt;

In 1977, Walker and Dumas reemployed Sam and his sidekick for a new strip with a "new" concept called ''[[Sam and Silo]]'', about a pair of bumbling cops in a quiet little town. While not as imaginative or innovative (Don Markstein's Toonopedia calls it "just a typical comic strip"&lt;ref name="toonopedia"&gt;{{cite web |first=Don |last=Markstein |title=''Sam's Strip'' |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |url=http://toonopedia.com/samstrip.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6oBIynW45?url=http://toonopedia.com/samstrip.htm |archivedate=February 10, 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), it was far more popular.&lt;ref name="tvtropes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comic Strip / ''Sam's Strip''||publisher=TV Tropes|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/SamsStrip|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, ''Sam and Silo'' is still being produced, now solely by Dumas.

==Critical analysis==
“Walker and Dumas clearly take pleasure in working in callbacks to classic comic strips [and] many of the metatextual gags are funny and fun," wrote ''[[The Comics Journal]]'''s Shaenon Garrity, adding that "Dumas’s drawings of classic comic-strip characters are excellent.”&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sams-Strip-Mort-Walker/dp/1560979720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Williams of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' agreed that "the strips that chip away at the fourth wall in particular frequently raise a smile, and occasionally even a laugh."&lt;ref name="denofgeek"&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Williams|title=Sam's Strip: The Comic About Comics review|publisher=Den of Geek|date=May 10, 2009|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/books-comics/5862/sams-strip-the-comic-about-comics-review|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Comic Book Resources]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; Chad Nevett elaborated that "Walker and Dumas are very adept at making most of those jokes [featuring run-ins with other strip characters] work on two levels, where the character’s role is obvious to those unaware of its pre-existence, while those in the know will get an extra kick out of it."&lt;ref name="cbr" /&gt; But Christopher Barat felt "that the creators didn't use [the] inter-strip get-togethers nearly as much as they should have. Instead, they whiled away a lot of their time with politically themed, time-dependent gags trading on the '[[New Frontier]]' administration of [[John F. Kennedy|John Kennedy]] and the contemporary [[Cold War]] atmosphere."&lt;ref name="amazon" /&gt;

==Books==
One paperback collection, ''Sam's Strip Lives!'', was published in small quantities under the aegis of the [[National Cartoon Museum|Museum of Cartoon Art]]. In December 2008, [[Fantagraphics Books]] released a 208-page paperback book containing the entire run of ''Sam's Strip''. It includes brief introductions by Dumas and Walker, unpublished sketches, original artwork, photographs, and sales brochures. Plus there are select annotations by Dumas and comics historian Brian Walker. "These strips aren't perfect and some gags are repeated far too many times," wrote Chad Nevett, "but this collection made me laugh at least once on nearly every page. ... Once again, Fantagraphics delivers a stellar package."&lt;ref name="cbr" /&gt; Andrew Williams' review agreed with that last statement: "[T]he near-flawless execution of the book helps to make it feel like more of a prestige package, a celebration of the series rather than just a cheap cash-in. ... Although the book will largely be bought by fans of the series, it's still accessible for absolute newcomers."&lt;ref name="denofgeek" /&gt; And KC Carlson of Comics Worth Reading stated, "If you ever had more than a passing interest in newspaper strips, you owe it to yourself to check out this collection."&lt;ref name="amazon" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5340">[[File:Symboles soudure V.svg|thumb|right|The symbolic representation of a V weld of chamfered plates in a technical drawing]]
The '''symbols and conventions used in [[welding]] documentation''' are specified in national and international standards such as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 2553 ''Welded, brazed and soldered joints -- Symbolic representation on drawings'' and ISO 4063 ''Welding and allied processes -- Nomenclature of processes and reference numbers''. The US standard symbols are outlined by the [[American National Standards Institute]] and the [[American Welding Society]] and are noted as "ANSI/AWS".&lt;ref name=greg&gt;{{cite book|author1=E. N. Gregory|author2=Ann A. Armstrong|title=Welding symbols on drawings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X9cxdD6GfdIC&amp;pg=PR7|accessdate=10 October 2011|date=20 April 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-3591-4|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to the growth of the oil industry, this symbol set was used during the 1990s in about 50% of the world's welding operations.&lt;ref name=greg/&gt; An ISO committee sought to establish a global standard during this decade.&lt;ref name=greg/&gt;

In [[engineering drawing]]s, each weld is conventionally identified by an arrow which points to the joint to be welded.  The arrow is annotated with letters, numbers and symbols which indicate the exact specification of the weld. In complex applications, such as those involving [[alloy]]s other than [[Carbon steel|mild steel]], more information may be called for than can comfortably be indicated using the symbols alone.&lt;ref name=greg/&gt; Annotations are used in these cases.&lt;ref name=greg/&gt;

==Component elements==
[[File:Elements of a welding symbol.PNG|thumb|right|350px|The location of the elements of a welding symbol when following US conventions.]]
In the US, the component elements of the weld specification are:&lt;ref name=TC9237&gt;{{citation |title=Welding Theory and Application |publisher=Department of the Army |date=7 May 1993 |number=Training Circular 9-237 |url=https://armypubs.us.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_aa/pdf/tc9_237.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The reference line - the body of the arrow which is the baseline for the specification.
# The arrow tip which goes at an angle to the reference line, pointing to the joint to be welded.
# The tail which goes at the other end of the reference line.
# The basic welding symbol which goes on the reference line to indicate the shape of the weld such as a fillet or plug.  The symbol is placed on the arrow side or other side of the line to indicate which side of the joint the weld goes.
# The dimensions and other numbers such as the length of the weld or number of spot welds go above and below the reference line.
# Supplementary symbols go at the junction of the reference line and the arrow tip.  One  such symbol is a circle to indicate an all-around weld, which goes on every side of the joint.
# Finish symbols go above the reference line to indicate the surface contour or finish of the weld such as flush, convex or concave.
# Letters indicating the welding process are placed at the tail end, such as AHW for [[atomic hydrogen welding]].  Further examples include:

'''''The New World of English Words, or, a General Dictionary''''' is a dictionary compiled by [[Edward Phillips]] and first published in [[London]] in 1658. It was the first [[Folio (printing)|folio]] English dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;Drake (2003), p. 853.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
As well as containing common words, the dictionary featured many unusual words, foreign terms, proper nouns and other specialist terms. In total, the original edition featured 11,000 entries, increasing to 17,000 by the fifth edition in 1696.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (2002), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later revised and enlarged by [[John Kersey the younger|John Kersey]] in 1706, eventually containing 38,000 entries. Kersey had already compiled his own dictionary, ''[[A New English Dictionary]]'', in 1702, and used this revised edition of ''The New World of English Words'' as the basis for his more concise ''[[Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum]]'' in 1708.&lt;ref&gt;Hüllen (2005), pp. 159-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plagiarism==
At least half of the entries were copied directly, without permission, from [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]]'s ''[[Glossographia]]'', which had been published a couple of years before. Blount responded by publishing ''A world of errors discovered in the Interpreter of Hard Words, written against Sir Edward Phillips book entitled A New World'' in 1673.&lt;ref&gt;Barber (1997), p. 78; Drake (2003), p. 853.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Full title==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The new world of English words, or, A general dictionary : containing the interpretations of such hard words as are derived from other languages, whether Hebrew, Arabick, Syriack, Greek, Latin, Italian, French, Spanish, British, Dutch, Saxon, &amp;c., their etymologies, and perfect definitions : together with all those terms that relate to the arts and sciences ... : to which are added the significations of proper names, mythology, and poetical fiction, historical relations, geographical descriptions of most countries and cities of the world, especially of those three nations, wherein their chiefest antiquities, battles, and other most memorable passages are mentioned : as also all other subjects that are useful and appertain to our English language : a work very necessary for strangers, as well as our own countrymen, for all persons that would rightly understand what they discourse, write, or read "

'''Wikimedia Commons''' (or simply '''Commons''') is an online repository of [[Free content|free-use]] images, sounds, and other media files.&lt;ref name="Endres"/&gt; It is a project of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].

Files from Wikimedia Commons can be used across all Wikimedia projects&lt;ref name="Embedding"/&gt; in all languages, including [[Wikipedia]], [[Wikibooks]], [[Wikivoyage]], [[Wikispecies]], [[Wikisource]], and [[Wikinews]], or downloaded for offsite use. As of 2018, the repository contains over 50&amp;nbsp;million free media files, managed and editable by registered volunteers.&lt;ref name ="CommonsStats"&gt;[[commons:Special:Statistics|Statistics page]] on Wikimedia Commons&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, the number of edits on Commons reached 100,000,000.&lt;ref name =100,000,000&gt;{{cite web|author=ÄŒesky |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump/Archive/2013/07#100.2C000.2C000th_edit |title =100,000,000th edit |publisher = Commons.wikimedia.org |date = July 15, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:WikimediaMosaicCapture.png|thumb|Wikimedia logo [[mosaic]] created to commemorate the one millionth file at Wikimedia Commons]]
The project was proposed by [[Erik Möller]] in March 2004&lt;ref name="Moller" /&gt;  and launched on September 7, 2004.&lt;ref name="LaunchMain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LaunchGolem" /&gt;  A key motivation behind the setup of a central repository was the desire to reduce duplication of effort across the Wikimedia projects and languages, as the same file had to be uploaded to many different wikis separately before Commons was created.

== Policies ==
The aim of Wikimedia Commons is to provide a media file repository "that makes available public domain and freely-licensed educational media content to all, and that acts as a common repository for the various projects of the Wikimedia Foundation." The expression "educational" is to be understood according to its broad meaning of "providing knowledge; instructional or informative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commons:Project scope|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Project_scope#Aim_of_Wikimedia_Commons|publisher=Wikimedia Commons editors|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Wikimedia projects still allow local uploads which are not visible to other projects or languages, but this option is meant to be used primarily for material (such as [[fair use]] content) which local project policies allow, but which would not be permitted according to the [[copyright]] policy of Commons. Wikimedia Commons itself does not allow fair use or uploads under non-free licenses, including licenses which restrict commercial use of materials or disallow derivative works. For this reason, Wikimedia Commons always hosts freely licensed media and deletes copyright violations. Licenses that are acceptable include the [[GNU Free Documentation License]], [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] Attribution and Attribution/ShareAlike licenses,&lt;ref name="CCL" /&gt;  other free content and [[free software]] licenses, and the [[public domain]].

The default language for Commons is English, but registered users can customize their interface to use any other available user interface translations. Many content pages, in particular policy pages and portals, have also been translated into various languages. Files on Wikimedia Commons are categorized using MediaWiki's category system. In addition, they are often collected on individual topical gallery pages. While the project was originally proposed to also contain free text files, these continue to be hosted on a sister project, [[Wikisource]].

== Controversial content ==
The site has been criticized for hosting large amounts of amateur pornography, often uploaded by [[exhibitionism|exhibitionists]] who exploit the site for personal gratification, and who are enabled by sympathetic administrators.&lt;ref name="Daily Dot Pricasso"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/wikimedia-commons-photos-jimmy-wales-broken/ |title=The Daily Dot – How Wikimedia Commons became a massive amateur porn hub}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[BuzzFeed]] described Wikimedia Commons as "littered with dicks".&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed dicks"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jackstuef/inside-the-seedy-world-of-wikipedia-exhibitionism |title=The Epic Battle For Wikipedia&amp;#39;s Autofellatio Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Wikipedia co-founder [[Larry Sanger]] [[Reporting of child pornography images on Wikimedia Commons|reported Wikimedia Commons to the FBI]] for hosting sexualized images of children known as "lolicon". After this was reported in the media, [[Jimmy Wales]], founder of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] which hosts Commons, used his administrator status to delete several images without discussion from the Commons community. Wales responded to the backlash from the Commons community by voluntarily relinquishing some site privileges, including the ability to delete files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20005082-93.html |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;Wikimedia's Wales gives up some top-level controls | Internet &amp; Media - CNET News&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Utilities ==

Over time, additional functionality has been developed to interface Wikimedia Commons with the other Wikimedia projects. Daniel Kinzler wrote applications for finding appropriate categories for uploaded files ("CommonSense"), determining the usage of files across the Wikimedia projects ("CheckUsage"), locating images with missing copyright information ("UntaggedImages"), and relaying information about administrative actions such as deletions to the relevant wikis ("{{Srlink|Commons:Commons:Tools|CommonsTicker}}").

Specialized uploading tools and scripts such as "[[:commons:Commons:Tools/Commonist|Commonist]]" have been created to simplify the process of uploading large numbers of files. In order to review free content photos uploaded to [[Flickr]], users can participate in a defunct collaborative external review process ("{{Srlink|Commons:User:FlickrLickr|FlickrLickr}}"), which has resulted in more than 10,000 uploads to Commons.&lt;ref name="Flickr" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2013}}{{Dead link|date=April 2016}}
&lt;!-- Media on Commons which is tagged with [[Geographic coordinate system|decimal coordinates]] has a [[Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]] on its page there. --&gt;

== Quality ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
[[File:Featured picture nominations per month in Wikimedia Commons.svg|thumb|Successful featured picture nominations per month (2004-2017)]]
The site has three mechanisms for recognizing quality works. One is known as "[[commons:Commons:Featured pictures|Featured pictures]]", where works are nominated and other community members vote to accept or reject the nomination. This process began in November 2004. Another process known as "[[commons:Commons:Quality Images|Quality images]]" began in June 2006, and has a simpler nomination process comparable to "Featured pictures". "Quality images" only accepts works created by Wikimedia users, whereas "Featured pictures" additionally accepts nominations of works by third parties such as NASA. A third image assessment project, known as "[[commons:Commons:Valued images|Valued images]]", began on June 1, 2008 with the purpose of recognizing "the most valued illustration of its kind", in contrast to the other two processes which assess images mainly on technical quality.

The three mentioned processes select a slight part (less than 0.1%) from the total number of files. However, Commons collects files of all quality levels, from the most professional level across simple documental and amateur files up to files of very poor quality. Generally, Commons is not a competition but a collection; a quality of the description and organization of files and their descriptive and informational benefits are often more relevant than technical or artistic perfection of the files. Files with specific defects can be tagged for improvement and warning or even proposed for deletion but there exists no process of systematic rating of all files.

The site held its inaugural "Picture of the Year" competition, for 2006. All images that were made a Featured picture during 2006 were eligible, and voted on by eligible [[Wikimedia movement]] members during two rounds of voting. The winning picture was a picture of the [[Aurora Borealis]] over snowlands, taken by an airman from the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. The competition has since become an annual event.

'''Willard Rowe Longson''' (June 8, 1906 – December 12, 1982) was an American [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], better known by his [[ring name]], '''Wild Bill Longson'''. He spent most of his career in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. He perfected the role of the arrogant [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], and is credited with inventing and popularizing the [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]].&lt;ref name="PWHF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/longson.asp|title=Bill Longson|publisher=[[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]]|work=PWHF.com|author=Luce, Don|accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
Longson was a 3-time [[World Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)|National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Champion]] during the 1940s.  He was also the last National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Champion, losing his title to [[Lou Thesz]] on July 20, 1948, when Thesz elevated onto Longson's shoulders from the piledriver position and fell into a [[Thesz press]].  As a result of this victory, Thesz unified the venerable National Wrestling Association Championship with his own new [[National Wrestling Alliance]] World Championship, beginning the process of consolidating all American world championships into one.

Longson retired from professional wrestling in 1960 after sustaining a broken [[pelvis]] while riding an [[Horse training|unbroken]] horse. He continued to work in the professional wrestling industry as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booker]] and [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] until 1977.&lt;ref name="PWHF"/&gt;

Longson died on December 10, 1982 in St. Louis.&lt;ref name="PWHF"/&gt;
