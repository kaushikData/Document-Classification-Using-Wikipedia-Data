'''American Peace Crusade''' ('''APC''') was an [[United States|American]] [[pacifism|peace advocacy]] organization.

Wittner]], the APC was the last [[Communist]]-headed [[Peace movement#Cold War|peace organization]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wittner1997"/&gt;

==History==
The APC was established in 1951 following the dissolution of the [[Peace Information Center]]. The founding committee included [[W.E.B. Du Bois]], chemist [[Linus Pauling]], and physicist [[Philip Morrison]].&lt;ref name=Lieberman101&gt;Lieberman (2010) [2000], [https://books.google.com/books?id=vzqXGAZ2hNoC&amp;pg=PA101 p. 101].&lt;/ref&gt; Especially because of the provocative comments made by [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]], American Peace Crusade feared that the [[Korean War]] would culminate in [[nuclear holocaust]]. The organization supported the withdrawal of US troops from the Korean Peninsula, talks with the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), and the removal of Douglas MacArthur, which the group believed would help ending the war.&lt;ref name="Smallwood2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Smallwood|title=Reform, Red Scare, and Ruin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aok6TB46nL0C&amp;pg=PA130|accessdate=29 February 2012|date=31 March 2008|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4257-3202-8|pages=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APC published a pamphlet titled "Let the People Speak for Peace" and asked for what is described by James Smallwood in his book ''Reform, Red Scare, and Ruin'' as a "peace pilgrimage". The purpose of this "peace pilgrimage" was advocacy for putting a stop to the Korean War. Civil rights activist and lobbyist [[Virginia Foster Durr]] was mentioned by the APC as a founding co-sponsor of "Let the People Speak for Peace" booklet and the "peace pilgrimage". The activities of the APC received widespread coverage in newspapers across the United States. On February 21, 1951, the ''[[Denver Post]]'' in a headline entitled "Wife of General Counsel of Farmers' Union Insurance Corporation Signs Red Petition" claimed the APC was controlled by Communists.&lt;ref name="Smallwood2008"/&gt;

The [[Subversive Activities Control Board]] (SACB) attempted to disband the American Peace Crusade. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) placed its agent inside APC and kept the organization under watch. The APC received an order from the SACB in August 1955 to officially register the organization as a front organization of the Communists.&lt;ref name="Lieberman2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robbie Lieberman|title=The Strangest Dream Communism, Anticommunism, and the U.S. Peace Movement, 1945-1963 (PB)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzqXGAZ2hNoC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=29 February 2012|publication-date=2010|year=2000|publisher=Syracuse University Press (republished in 2010 by Information Age Publishing)|isbn=978-1-61735-054-2|pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Peace Crusade was disestablished in 1956,&lt;ref name="Wittner1997"/&gt; but local affiliates such as the Southern California Peace Crusade continued to operate for some time thereafter.&lt;ref name=Lieberman106&gt;Lieberman (2010) [2000], [https://books.google.com/books?id=vzqXGAZ2hNoC&amp;pg=PA106 p. 106].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Assemblea Nacional Catalana''' ("Catalan National Assembly"; '''ANC''' by its Catalan acronym) is an organization that seeks the political [[independence]] of [[Catalonia]] from [[Spain]]. Secondarily, it also promotes the reunification{{Clarify|reason=|date=September 2018}} of the [[Catalan Countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les coincidències i discrepàncies dels fulls de ruta cap a la independència|newspaper=Vilaweb|date=26 March 2015|language=Catalan|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4237507/20150326/coincidencies-discrepancies-fulls-ruta-cap-independencia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its current president is [[Jordi Sànchez i Picanyol]], who was imprisoned on 16 October 2017 for his role in pro-independence protests during the days before the Catalan [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017|referendum]]. In January 2015, it claimed more than 80,000 members, of which 40,132 were full-paying members (fee paying) and 39,946 were signed up as volunteer collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L'ANC ja té 51.000 adherits, el doble de fa un any|newspaper=Vilaweb|date=5 April 2014|language=Catalan|url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/ma/article/3-politica/17-politica/810811-lanc-supera-els-40000-socis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ANC has 10 regional subdivisions which are represented on the national board as well as professional groups for various private sectors, and 37 foreign branches around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://catalanassembly.org/foreign-assemblies/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Estelada d'espelmes a la plaça Major de Vic 04.JPG|thumb|250px|Estelada (Catalan separatist flag) of candle organized by the ANC in the Major square in [[Vic]], 11 October 2012.]]

The origin of the organization was the '''National Conference for the Catalan State''' (Conferència Nacional per l'Estat Propi), held on 30 April 2011 in [[Barcelona]], in which 1,500 people participated.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} A Permanent Council and the interim secretariat were elected at this conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpunt.cat/noticia/article/3-politica/17-politica/404479.html La Conferència per l'Estat Propi inicia la ruta sobiranista], El Punt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llibertat.cat/content/view/12630/29/ Consens i unitat per impulsar l'Assemblea Nacional Catalana], Llibertat.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal incorporation as a civic association was held on 10 March 2012, at the [[Palau Sant Jordi]] in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ara.cat/politica/Assembla_Nacional_Catalana-ANC-independencia_0_661133977.html Neix oficialment l'Assemblea Nacional de Catalunya per traçar el camí cap a la independència], Ara.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.324.cat/noticia/1637212/catalunya/Neix-lAssemblea-Nacional-Catalana-amb-lobjectiu-de-promoure-un-referendum-per-la-independencia-el-2014 Neix l'Assemblea Nacional Catalana amb l'objectiu de promoure un referèndum per la independència el 2014], 324.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the statutes, internal workings, and road map to independence were approved. In April 2012, Carme Forcadell was chosen as President of the ANC, while Carles Castellanos was elected vice-president, Llorenç Sotorres was treasurer, and Jordi Martínez was elected secretary.

On 8 June 2013, the ANC held elections in which Carme Forcadell was re-elected president. Jaume Marfany was elected vicepresident, substituting Carles Castellanos, Jordi Martínez remained as secretary and Oriol Sallas replaced Llorenç Sotorres as treasurer.

In May 2015 Jordi Sanchez i Picanyol replaced Carme Forcadell as president of the ANC.

==Campaigns and activity==
[[File:EstelArtés.jpg|thumb|Symbolic event in [[Artés]] of deploying a giant ''[[estelada]]'']]
The regional chapters of the ANC periodically organize a series of events in their respective areas with respect to the independence of Catalonia in preparation for the [[Catalan independence referendum, 2014|Catalan independence referendum in 2014]].

===11 September 2012===
[[File:Fanals-Banc P1150941.JPG|225px|esquerra|thumb|[[2012 Catalan independence demonstration]]]]
At the end of June, 2012, the so-called "March toward Independence" begun in Seu Vella (Lleida). After a series of festive, symbolic, and protest events, this march would culminate on 11 September with a massive march on Barcelona, with the slogan "Catalonia, new state in Europe". It was a historic day for the separatist camp, both for the number of people in attendance as well as the markedly pro-independence tone of the march, never before seen in such a well-attended event (estimates of the crowds range widely, from 600,000 people quoted by some media,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.elpais.com/defensor-del-lector/2012/09/c%C3%A1lculo-de-manifestantes.html Cálculo de manifestantes &gt;&gt; Defensora del Lector &gt;&gt; Blogs El País]&lt;/ref&gt; statisticians such as Llorenç Badiella from the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]]&lt;ref name="lavanguardia"&gt;{{cite news |title=Unas 600.000 personas en la manifestación independentista |first=Llorenç |last=Badiella |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20120914/54349577571/manifestacion-independentista-600-000-personas.html |agency=La Vanguardia |location=Barcelona |date=14 September 2012 |language=Spanish |accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the delegation of the [[Government of Spain|Spanish government]] in Catalonia&lt;ref name="elpais"&gt;{{cite news |title=El independentismo catalán logra una histórica exhibición de fuerza |first=Àngels |last=Piñol |url=http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2012/09/11/catalunya/1347375808_419590.html |agency=El País |location=Barcelona |date=11 September 2012 |language=Spanish |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Diada.- El Govern central xifra l'assistència en 600.000 persones |url=http://www.europapress.cat/politica/noticia-diada-govern-central-xifra-lassistencia-600000-persones-20120911210226.html |agency=Europa Press |location=Barcelona |date=11 September 2012 |language=Catalan |accessdate=13 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102142454/http://www.europapress.cat/politica/noticia-diada-govern-central-xifra-lassistencia-600000-persones-20120911210226.html |archive-date=2 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La delegació del govern espanyol a Catalunya xifra en 600.000 els assistents a la manifestació de la Diada |url=http://www.acn.cat/acn/683844/Noticia/text/Noticia.html |agency=Agència Catalana de Notícies |location=Madrid |date=11 September 2012 |language=Catalan |accessdate=13 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913123630/http://www.acn.cat/acn/683844/Noticia/text/Noticia.html |archivedate=13 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1.5 million according to Catalan public sources such as [[Guàrdia Urbana de Barcelona|Barcelona's Municipal Police]] or Catalonia's Department of the Interior, with a maximum estimate of about 2 million according to the organizers)&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.elpais.com/defensor-del-lector/2012/09/c%C3%A1lculo-de-manifestantes.html Cálculo de manifestantes &gt;&gt; Defensora del Lector &gt;&gt; Blogs El País]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after the demonstration, the president of the ANC, Carme Forcadell, and four additional members of the group's board were officially received at the [[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan Government Palace]] by then president [[Artur Mas]]. During the meeting, they suggested to him that he called [[Plebiscite|plebescitary]] elections to the Parliament of Catalonia on independence and that he called for a referendum in 2014.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

As a result of the demonstration, Mas called a [[Catalan parliamentary election, 2012|snap election to the Catalan Parliament]] for 25 November 2012 and made clear in his speech in the inaugural session of the General Policy Debates that he was convinced that the Parliament that came out of the new elections would have as its mission the exercise of the right to [[self-determination]] of Catalonia.

===2013===
[[File:Mosaic del Concert per la Llibertat.jpg|thumb|left|[[Concert for Freedom]] at [[Camp Nou]], on 29 June 2013.]]
At the beginning of 2013, the ANC began a '''Fiscal Sovereignty''' campaign so that private citizens, businesses, and local institutions could pay taxes en masse to the Catalan Tax Agency. From May to July, 2013, they organized a [[crowdfunding]] campaign at totSuma in order to offer support to all the interested parties.

On 1 June 2013, the ANC began the '''"Sign a vote for independence"''' campaign, in which, through the [[right to petition]], petitions were collected to ask the Catalan Parliament to exhaust all of the possible paths toward facilitating the celebration of a [[referendum for self-determination of Catalonia]] before 31 May 2014, and in the event that that attempt failed that the elected representatives of the people of Catalonia [[Unilateral declaration of independence|unilaterally declare the independence]] of Catalonia.

The Catalan National Assembly and [[Òmnium Cultural]] organized a concert, the so-called '''[[Concert for Freedom]]''', in [[Camp Nou]] on 29 June 2013 to show off mass support in favor of independence. Around 90,000 people attended the concert.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The Catalan Assembly also organized a [[human chain]] of about 400&amp;nbsp;km in length, known as the '''[[Catalan Way]]''', that was held on the [[National Day of Catalonia]] (11 September) following the path of the old [[Via Augusta]] from [[La Jonquera]] (in the north of Catalonia) to [[Alcanar]] (in the south). It was inspired by the [[Baltic Way]], which was organized by Baltic political movements seeking independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1989 and spanned the three [[Baltic states]] of [[Estonian SSR]], [[Latvian SSR]], and [[Lithuanian SSR]]. Between 1.6 and 2 million citizens held their hands along these 400&amp;nbsp;km.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} After the demonstration, then Catalan President Artur Mas received Mrs. Forcadell at the Government Palace and committed to listen to the will of the people and to organising a consultation on the region's future.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===2014===
On 29 May 2014, the ANC, with other associations, presented at "El Born", the campaign "El País que Volem" (The Country we Want), an open participative process for citizens whose goal is to collect their proposals about how should Catalonia be when it becomes an independent state.{{clarify|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=El País que Volem' neix perquè ciutadans i entitats dibuixin la Catalunya independent|publisher=[[Diari Ara]]| date=2014-05-29| url=http://www.ara.cat/politica/El_Pais_Que_Volem-Catalunya-independent-ciutadans-entitats_0_1147085551.html| access-date=2014-06-09|language=catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catalan Assembly and Òmnium Cultural organized the 2014 edition of the demonstration of the Catalan national day in Barcelona. This demonstration formed a huge Catalan flag all along 11 kilometers between Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes and Diagonal avenue forming a big "V" for will ("voluntat"), voting and victory.
According to police there were 1.8 million and according to organizations 2.5 million people to demand for a poll on 9 November 2014.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/noticia/article/3-politica/17-politica/776145-la-v-la-mobilitzacio-mes-gran-deuropa--una-realitat.html?dema=1&amp;tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;page=|access-date=2014-09-14 |title=1,8 milions de catalans reclamen votar amb una històrica V a Barcelona|work=elpuntavui.cat|language=catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September the Catalan Assembly gave to the parliament president, Núria de Gispert, nearly 750,000 signatures collected in the campaign "Sign a vote for independence", to ask Catalan government to declare independence if the 9 November poll could not be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ara.cat/politica/ANC-PARLAMENT-VOT-CONSULTA_0_1212478886.html| access-date=2014-09-15 |title=L'ANC entrega 750,000 signatures per l'estat propi|work=ara.cat|language=catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Catalonia - Sí flag v2.svg|thumb|The Assemblea distributed "Sí" banners during the [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017|2017 independence referendum]]]]

==Finances==

The budget for 2015 was slightly over 5 million euros, from which 3.4 million were dedicated to various advertising campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://societat.e-noticies.cat/lanc-paga-mes-de-250000-euros-a-lestat-101864.html L'ANC paga més de 250.000 euros a l'Estat - Notícies societat - e-noticies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the detection of 1.5 million euro in unsubstantiated income, in 2015 the ANC reached a deal with the tax authorities to pay 172,000 euros in [[Tax evasion#Evasion of value added tax (VAT) and sales taxes|pending VAT]] plus a 44,000 euros tax penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.es/catalunya/politica/20150824/abci-asamblea-nacional-catalana-paga-201508241105.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate piece, in November 2015 the ANC was found responsible of unauthorized use and deficient custody of [[personal data]] for its activities, resulting in a 240,000 euros sanction imposed by the Spanish agency responsible for [[data protection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2015/11/20/564eedcc268e3e8b058b45f3.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bahraini opposition''' refers to a group of political groups who are opposed to the [[Cabinet of Bahrain]] government and the ruling monarch of [[House of Khalifa]]. Currently, the Bahraini opposition can be divided into the officially registered political parties, who demand reforms to the current political system, and the unregistered opposition groups. Most of the opposition is comprised from the [[Shia]] population of Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walid Phares|title=The Lost Spring: U.S. Policy in the Middle East and Catastrophes to Avoid|date=18 Mar 2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137431387|page=74|edition=unabridged}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The alliance of registered opposition parties consists of:
*[[Al Wefaq|Al Wefaq National Islamic Society]]
*[[National Democratic Action Society]] (Wa'ad)
*[[Progressive Democratic Tribune]]
*[[Islamic Action Society]] (Amal) 
*Al Wahdawi
*Al Ekha
*[[Nationalist Democratic Assembly]]

The unlicensed opposition consists of:
*[[Haq Movement]]
*[[February 14 Youth Coalition]]
*Al Wafa
*[[Bahrain Freedom Movement]]
*[[National Liberation Front – Bahrain]]
*[[Hezbollah Al-Hejaz]]
*[[Al-Ashtar Brigades]]

Since the [[Bahraini protests of 2011]], all opposition parties have boycotted [[Elections in Bahrain|parliamentary elections]]. The opposition has since failed to overthrow the Cabinet of Bahrain.

The supreme body of the hierarchical control of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], as well as the highest authority in the management of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]].

==Functions==
The modern term appeared in the "Regulations of the Russian Orthodox Church", adopted by the [[Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church|Local Council]] in 1945. During the course of the "Regulations" going only once: July 18, 1961, and even then without prior notice&lt;ref&gt;source not specified 228 days&lt;/ref&gt;  to make anticanonical&lt;Ref&gt;needed 228 days&lt;/ref&gt; amendments to the "Regulations", the conclusions of the members of the clergy church community. As the Council of Bishops was finalized in the Charter, adopted by the [[1988 Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church|1988 meeting of the Local Council]] on 8 June 1988.
According to the Russian Orthodox Church charter adopted in 2000 the Council of Bishops: 
"The Council of Bishops is the supreme authority of the hierarchical control of the Russian Orthodox Church and a member of the diocesan bishops, as well as suffragan bishops, the heads of the Synodal institutions and Spiritual Academy or having the canonical jurisdiction over its subordinate parishes. Other vicar bishops may participate in meetings of the Council of Bishops, without the right to vote."

"The Council of Bishops meets the [[Patriarch of Moscow and All the Rus']] (Locum Tenens) and the [[Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church]] at least once every four years and in anticipation of the Local Council, and in exceptional cases provided for, in particular, paragraph 20 of section V of this Constitution"

==History==
In contrast to the [[Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church]], the Council of Bishops convened regularly since 1990, when the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, was elected Metropolitan of Leningrad Alexis (Ridiger)

A '''chief restructuring officer''' ('''CRO''') is a senior officer of a company given broad powers to renegotiate all aspects of a company’s finances to deal with an impending [[bankruptcy]] or to restructure a company following a bankruptcy filing. The use of CRO’s, who usually have an expertise in the field of business in which the company operates, has been increasing in popularity since the 1990s. CROs are sometimes seen as an alternative to using a [[Trustee in bankruptcy]] in a reorganization bankruptcy, because the trustees may not be knowledgeable in field of business conducted by the company.

Further CRO’s give the company management and [[creditor]]s more of say in the running of a company than a trustee is required to do so. CRO’s have sometimes been compared to “turn around” consultants although the CRO differs from a turn around consultant in that the CRO is an official of the company and has executive power.&lt;ref name="turnaround1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turnaround.org/Publications/Articles.aspx?objectID=6588 |title=Are CROs More Powerful than Turnaround Consultants? Creditors Drive Trend Toward New Title — Turnaround Management Association |publisher=Turnaround.org |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While CRO’s officially report to the company and its board of directors, they are considered to have greatly strengthened the hand of creditors since the CRO can make executive decisions following a direct meeting with the creditors.&lt;ref name="turnaround1"/&gt; On occasional instances, the CRO can oust the chief executive officer (CEO) or President of the company, as happened in 2012 when [[Gregory F. Rayburn]] replaced [[Hostess Brands]] CEO Brian Driscoll as CEO a month after being appointed CRO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kary |first=Tiffany |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-09/twinkie-maker-hostess-s-ceo-driscoll-said-to-quit-rayburn-to-replace-him.html |title=Hostess CEO Driscoll To Quit Bankrupt Twinkie-Maker |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conciliation Resources''' is an independent organisation working with people in conflict to prevent violence and build peace, providing advice, support and practical resources.&lt;ref&gt;Conciliation Resources, Work inReview, 2010-2011&lt;/ref&gt; It also takes the lessons learned to government decision-makers and others working to end the conflict to improve peacebuilding policies and practice worldwide.

==History==

Conciliation Resources was established in 1994 by Andy Carl and David Lord, supported by a group of advisors and volunteers. Its earliest project work began in [[Fiji]] in 1995 with the newly formed Citizen’s Constitutional Forum. As news of its launch spread to a wider audience, its connections and range of work increased. Soon the [[NGO]] started working also in the midst of the war in [[Sierra Leone]] and Liberia with local intermediaries and journalists reporting on the conflicts. Currently, Conciliation Resources works with partners in the [[South Caucasus]], East and Central Africa, Southeast Asia ([[The Philippines]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/joint-statement-government-philippines-and-moro-islamic-liberation-negotiating|title = Joint Statement of the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Negotiating Panels: On the 38th Formal Exploratory Talks|date = 15 July 2013|website = Relief Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Asia ([[Kashmir conflict|Jammu and Kashmir]]), Pacific (Fiji and Bougainville, an autonomous region in Papua New Guinea), Latin America ([[Colombia]]), the Horn of Africa ([[Kenya]] and the [[Ogaden]] region of Ethiopia - also known as [[Somali Regional State]]) and West Africa ([[Mano River Union]] and [[Nigeria]]).

==Accord==

Described by [[Johan Galtung]] as an "indispensable source",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-r.org/accord&lt;/ref&gt; Accord is a series of publications that "informs and strengthens peace processes by documenting and analysing practical lessons and innovations of peacebuilding". Its first edition was released in 1996, documenting the Liberian peace process from 1990 to 1996 and exploring why "13 separate peace accords collapsed in half as many years". A representative of the International Negotiations Network in Liberia, Dayle Spencer, praised the first publication as "useful to scholars and policymakers".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-r.org/accord/liberia&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Conciliation Resources has published another 25 editions addressing specific conflicts in countries such as [[Colombia]], [[Lebanon]], Northern [[Uganda]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]] and [[Indonesia]], and peacebuilding themes such as “cross-border peacebuilding”, “engaging armed groups” or “public participation”, with articles written by a wide range of experts. The most recent edition, called ''Legitimacy and Peace Processes'', was released in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c-r.org/accord-project/legitimacy-and-peace-processes&lt;/ref&gt; It analyses issues related to governance, inclusivity and political transition using case studies like [[Nepal]], [[Burma]], [[Brazil]] and [[Yemen]].

==ICG in Mindanao==

"The parties expressed their appreciation to President Aquino for his commitment to a just and lasting peace in [[Mindanao]] (...) They also extended their gratitude to the members of the International Contact Group, namely [[Japan]], The Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]], Republic of [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue]] (HD), Conciliation Resources, Muhammadiyah, and [[The Asia Foundation]] (TAF)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tribuneonline.org/index.php/nation/item/9698-gov%E2%80%99t-milf-sign-terms-for-3rd-party-monitoring|title = Gov’t, MILF sign terms for 3rd party monitoring|date = January 2013|website = Daily Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Composed for four states and four international NGOS, the International Contact Group (ICG) was established in 2009 by the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). On 15 October 2012, after four decades of armed conflict and 15 years of negotiations, the parties signed a framework peace agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/PH_090915_Framework%20agreement%20on%20the%20contact%20group.pdf|title = Framework Agreement on the Formation of the International Contact Group for GRP-MILF Peace Process|date = 15 September 2009|accessdate = 14 August 2013|website = United Nations|type = Online PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the first ever hybrid ICG and its functions are: attend and observe negotiations on the invitation of the parties and facilitator; provide discreet advice; provide expert assistance on specific issues; meet any of the parties upon request to help resolve substantive issues; and INGOS were additionally requested to "act as a bridge between parties, ICG, facilitator, and local partners in support of the peace process".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.c-r.org/resources/practice-paper-innovation-mediation-international-contact-group-mindanao#sthash.g3AlNQG5.dpuf|title = Innovation in mediation support: The International Contact Group in Mindanao|date = August 2013|website = Conciliation Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conciliation Resources' involvement in Mindanao dates back to 1999 when it documented its peace process in the Accord publication, ''Compromising on Autonomy ''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.c-r.org/accord/philippines-mindanao|title = Compromising on autonomy: Mindanao in transition (updated 2003: The Mindanao peace process)|year = 1999|website = Conciliation Resources|editor-last = Stankovitch|editor-first = Mara}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its approach is framed by a commitment to women empowerment.

==Fiji==
Conciliation Resources’ involvement in Fiji dates back to 1995, when it began working with the newly formed national group the Citizens’ Constitutional Forum (CCF). In recent years, the NGO has expanded its work to support other partners, including the Pacific Centre for Peacebuilding and Dialogue Fiji. It has contributed to a gradual shift in attitude towards dialogue as a means of resolving conflict, along with a greater understanding and acceptance of human rights, good governance and multiculturalism in Fiji.   Furthermore, in supporting dialogue initiatives in Fiji, Conciliation Resources has helped build relationships between different ethnic and political groups, both at local and national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.c-r.org/our-work/fiji|title = Our Work - Fiji|accessdate = 14 Aug 2013|website = Conciliation Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.minorityrights.org/11863/events/event-invitation-fijis-constitutional-standoff-consequences-for-interethnic-relations.html|title = Event invitation: Fiji’s constitutional stand-off – consequences for inter-ethnic relations|date = 16 April 2013|website = Minority Rights|type = Event News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/news-events/podcasts/fiji-challenges-and-opportunities-diversity-part-b#.UguDXBZ9VWg|title = Fiji: the challenges and opportunities of diversity (part B)|website = Australian National University|accessdate = 14 August 2013|type = Podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, the Reverend [[Akuila Yabaki]], Chief Executive Officer of CCF, one the partners in the region, received a sentence of three months imprisonment, suspended for twelve months, concerning the reprinting of an article quoting a 2011 report by the UK [[Law Society of England and Wales|Law Society Charity]], ''Fiji: The Rule of Law Lost'', in which questions were raised over the impartiality of Fiji's judiciary. Responding to this sentence, Conciliation Resources expressed concern that the legal action could serve to curtail public debate and freedom of expression in the Pacific nation, whose government, at that moment, still had to announce a new constitution, replacing the one they abrogated in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.c-r.org/press-releases/CCF-Akuila-Yabaki-contempt-court-fiji-civil-society|title = Concerns over contempt of court prosecution in Fiji: Civil society must be free to uphold accountability|date = 9 Aug 2013|website = Conciliation Resources|type = Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/news/press-releases/fiji-freedom-of-speech-convictions-condemned/|title = Fiji 'freedom of speech' convictions condemned|date = 15 May 2013|website = The Law Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/news/press-releases/fijian-authorities-hesitant-about-investigation-into-rule-of-law,-says-law-society/|title = Fijian authorities hesitant about investigation into rule of law, says Law Society|date = 5 July 2012|website = The Law Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=78217|title = Sentence prompts concern from CCF partner over freedom in Fiji|date = 12 August 2013|website = Radio New Zealand International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mano River Union==
Since 2007, Conciliation Resources has been working with partner NGOs in the Mano River basin countries of [[Liberia]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Guinea]] to facilitate dialogue between communities in the border regions and their governments to achieve improved governance, accountability and transparency. These countries in particular are linked not only by their common borders and ethnic groups but also by their history and conflicts, and Conciliation Resources’ work aim to improve the rights and needs of border communities. Lessons learnt from this work confirmed that many of the underlying causes which led to conflicts still present a number of serious challenges to the consolidation of peace in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.c-r.org/sites/cr.org/files/MRU_bordercommunitysecurity_ConciliationResources.pdf|title = Border community security - Mano River Union region|date = August 2013|accessdate = 14 August 2013|website = Conciliation Resources|type = Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 2012, the Accord 23, ''Consolidating peace Liberia and Sierra Leone'', was focused on the Mano River Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.c-r.org/resources/consolidating-peace-liberia-and-sierra-leone|title = Consolidating peace: Liberia and Sierra Leone|date = August 2012|accessdate = 14 August 2013|website = Accord 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conflict transformation''' is a concept designed to reframe the way in which [[peacebuilding]] initiatives are discussed and pursued, particularly in contexts of [[ethnic conflict]]. Traditionally the emphasis has been on [[conflict resolution]] and [[conflict management]] methods, which focus on reducing or defusing outbreaks of hostility.  '''Conflict transformation''', in contrast, places a greater weight on addressing the underlying conditions which give rise to that conflict, preferably well in advance of any hostility, but also to ensure a [[sustainable]] peace. In other terms, it attempts to make explicit and then reshape the social structures and dynamics behind the conflict, often employing analytical tools borrowed from [[systems thinking]]. "The very structure of parties and relationships may be embedded in a pattern of conflictual relationships that extend beyond the particular site of conflict. Conflict transformation is therefore a process of engaging with and transforming the relationships, interests, discourses and, if necessary, the very constitution of society that supports the continuation of violent conflict".&lt;ref name="Miall"&gt;Hugh Miall (2004) [http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Handbook/Articles/miall_handbook.pdf Conflict Transformation: A Multi-Dimensional Task], Berghof Handbook for Conflict Transformation, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches, definitions==
Conflict transformation approaches differ from those of [[conflict management]] or [[conflict resolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Books/Book_Glossary_Chapters_en/berghof_glossary_2012_02_conflict_prevention_management_resolution.pdf Berghof Glossary, Conflict Prevention, Management, Resolution] on [http://www.berghof-foundation.org Berghof Foundation's] web&lt;/ref&gt;
Whereas conflict transformation involves transforming the relationships that support violence, conflict management approaches seek to merely manage and contain conflict, and conflict resolution approaches seek to move conflict parties away from [[zero-sum]] positions towards positive outcomes, often with the help of external actors.&lt;ref name="Miall"/&gt;

Conflict transformation theory and practice are often associated with the academics and practitioners [[Johan Galtung]] and [[John Paul Lederach]].
&lt;!--sources by name, further (organizations, institutions) following after Galtung (and Lederach, to be added yet)--&gt;
According to [[Johan Galtung]]'s ''[[Transcend Method]]'' conflict transformation theory and practice, and process/es, comprise:&lt;ref name=galtung-un-2000-p10&gt;[[Johan Galtung]]: ''The Transcend Method at a glance: a one-page version'' (page 5) in: [https://www.transcend.org/pctrcluj2004/TRANSCEND_manual.pdf ''Conflict Transformation by Peaceful Means (the Transcend Method) – Participants'/Trainers' Manual''], United Nations 2000 (at [https://www.transcend.org/ transcend.org])&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

and are based upon ''basic premises'' inspired by main world religions:&lt;ref name=galtung-un-2000-p10/&gt;
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
# ''following [[Hindu]] thought...&lt;br&gt;Conflict the Destroyer and Conflict the Creator; conflict as a source of violence and conflict as a source of development. The conflict [i.e. conflict transformation] worker has the third role as Preserver, transforming the conflict by avoiding violence, promoting development.''
# ''following [[Buddhist]] thought...&lt;br&gt;Codependent origination, everything grows together in mutual causation. Conflicts have no beginning and no end, we all share the responsibility; no single actor (like statesmen) carries all the responsibility (monopoly) and no single actor carries all the guilt.''
# ''following [[Christian]] thought...&lt;br&gt;Ultimately, the responsibility for conflict transformation lies with individuals and their individual responsibility and decisions to act so as to promote peace rather than violence, and the principle of hope.''
# ''following [[Daoist]] thought...&lt;br&gt;Everything is yin and yang, good and bad, there is the high likelihood that the action chosen also has negative consequences and that action not chosen may have positive consequences; hence the need for reversibility, only doing what can be undone.''
# ''following [[Islamic]] thought...&lt;br&gt;The strength deriving from submitting together to a common goal, including the concrete responsibility for the well-being of all.''
# ''following [[Judaic]] thought...&lt;br&gt;The truth lies less in a verbal formula than in the dialogue to arrive at the formula, and that dialogue has no beginning and no end.''
}}

According to [[Berghof Foundation]], conflict transformation means:
:: ''A generic, comprehensive term referring to actions and processes seeking to alter the various characteristics and manifestations of violent conflict by addressing the root causes of a particular conflict over the long term. It aims to transform negative destructive conflict into positive constructive conflict and deals with structural, behavioural and attitudinal aspects of conflict. The term refers to both the process and the completion of the process. As such, it incorporates the activities of processes such as conflict prevention and conflict resolution and goes farther than conflict settlement or conflict management.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Handbook/Articles/handbook_glossary.pdf The Berghof Handbook Glossary] &gt; [http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Books/Book_Glossary_Chapters_en/berghof_glossary_2012_03_conflict_transformation.pdf expanded into the Berghof Glossary, Conflict Transformation] on [http://www.berghof-foundation.org Berghof Foundation's] web&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Institute for Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding]] (ICP), conflict transformation means:
:: ''Conflict transformation, in contrast to conflict resolution, does not only seek to resolve the contradiction in a conflict setting. It also aims at addressing structural and social root causes by challenging injustices and restoring human relations and it deals with ethnical and value-based dimensions. Conflict transformation is not only an approach or a tool but primarily a mindset. Conflict transformation, according to our 3 Cs approach, needs to be comprehensive, compassionate and creative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/node/10 ''ICP: About Conflict Transformation &amp; Peacebuilding''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150209195513/http://www.iicp.ch/node/10 |date=2015-02-09 }} at ICP web [http://www.iicp.ch/ iicp.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;''

According to [[Search for Common Ground]] conflict transformation initiatives are often characterized by longtime horizons and interventions at multiple levels, aimed at changing perceptions and improving communications skills addressing the roots of conflict, including inequality and social injustice.&lt;ref name="SFCG"&gt;SFCG (no date) [http://www.sfcg.org/resources/resources_terms.html Commonly Used Terms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829005441/http://www.sfcg.org/resources/resources_terms.html |date=2009-08-29 }}, Search for Common Ground&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Principles of Conflict Transformation'', by [[TransConflict]], specify further in order to help with defining conflict transformation:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
:* ''Conflict should not be regarded as an isolated event that can be resolved or managed, but as an integral part of society’s on-going evolution and development;''
:* ''Conflict should not be understood solely as an inherently negative and destructive occurrence, but rather as a potentially positive and productive force for change if harnessed constructively;''
:* ''Conflict transformation goes beyond merely seeking to contain and manage conflict, instead seeking to transform the root causes of a particular conflict;''
:* ''Conflict transformation is a long-term, gradual and complex process, requiring sustained engagement and interaction;''
:* ''Conflict transformation is not just an approach and set of techniques, but a way of thinking about and understanding conflict itself;''
:* ''Conflict transformation is particularly intended for intractable conflicts, where deep-rooted issues fuel protracted violence;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ref name="TransConflict"&gt;[http://www.transconflict.com/advocate/global-coalition-for-conflict-transformation/principles-of-conflict-transformation/ Principles of Conflict Transformation], TransConflict&lt;/ref&gt;''...continued by some ten more...''

Examples of areas where [[Cambodia|Cambodians]] encounter corrupt practices in their everyday lives include obtaining medical services, dealing with alleged traffic violations, and pursuing fair court verdicts. Companies are urged to be aware when dealing with extensive red tape when obtaining licenses and permits, especially construction related permits, and that the demand for and supply of bribes are commonplace in this process. The 2010 Anti-Corruption Law provides no protection to [[whistleblowers]], and whistleblowers can be jailed for up to 6 months if they report corruption that cannot be proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambodia Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/kingdom-of-cambodia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extent ==
One of the worst kinds of corruption is that related to human trafficking. The anti human trafficking unit in Phnom Penh is the epitome of that. Bribes to arrest innocent people have been accepted and sexual favors from prostitutes have been demanded and recorded by NGOs. 

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 161st place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Anti-corruption efforts ==
The Cambodian government has made developments in their fight against corruption. In January 2012, the National Assembly passed Cambodia's first law on public procurement in a bid to fight endemic corruption in the public sector. In 2010, the government established the National Arbitration Center, Cambodia's first alternative dispute resolution mechanism, to enable companies to resolve commercial disputes more quickly and inexpensively than through the court system. Official operation of the center was delayed until early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambodia Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/kingdom-of-cambodia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cambodian government passed the Anti-Corruption Law in March 2010. Under the new law, any official found guilty of corruption can face up to 15 years in prison. Under Cambodia's Anti-Corruption Law, people who resort to facilitation payments to obtain government services will now face harsh penalties; this also applies to government officials on the receiving end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambodia Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/east-asia-the-pacific/kingdom-of-cambodia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corròp''' (in [[Aranese language|Aranese]]: ''group of people associated with a common objective'') is a political party in the [[Val d'Aran]] founded in 2015. The party defends [[Occitania|Occitan]] and [[Val d'Aran|Aranese]] self-determination, [[socialism]] in an [[Anticapitalism|anticapitalist]] sense, [[direct democracy]] and [[ecologism]]. Corròp also supports an autonomous [[Aran Valley]] in an [[Catalan independence|independent Catalonia]] as the best short-term solution to the Aranese issue and the [[Catalan independence]] debate in the valley, considering that the independence of Catalonia is good for both Aran and the whole [[Occitania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4286853/20150508/corrop-nova-formacio-occitanista-laran-campanya.html Corròp, nova formació occitanista a l'Aran en aquesta campanya]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the members of Corròp come from the [[Aran Valley|Aranese]] section of Libertat!, an [[Occitania|Occitan]] left-wing independentism movement. The party's main referent in [[Catalonia]] is the [[Popular Unity Candidacy]], which included a member of Corròp as its candidate in the [[Catalan regional election, 2015|Catalan elections of 2015]]. Nevertheless, Corròp also included [[Occitan Republican Left]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://locals.esquerra.cat/altpirineu/article/25474/comunicat-de-lexecutiva-regional-desquerra-de-lalt-pirineu-i-aran COMUNICAT DE L’EXECUTIVA REGIONAL D’ESQUERRA DE L’ALT PIRINEU I ARAN]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens]].

'''The Dutch Peoples-Union''' ({{lang-nl|Nederlandse Volks-Unie}}, {{IPA-nl|ˈneːdərlɑntsə ˈvɔlksˌyni}}, '''NVU''') is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] [[political party]].&lt;ref&gt;Cas Mudde, 2003, Manchester University Press, p. 118-122. {{ISBN|0-7190-6446-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party strives for a fusion of the Netherlands with [[Flanders]] and a Europe of the Fatherlands.

== History ==
The party was founded as a political party in 1971 by Guus Looy, with as key purpose to rehabilitate convicted WW-II war criminals. In 1973 [[Roeland Raes]], of the Belgian ''[[Vlaams Blok]]'', became vice-president (reflecting the desire of both parties to unite the Netherlands and Flanders) and later that year [[Joop Glimmerveen]] took over the position of president. During the 1970s, the party became increasingly militant as younger [[neo-Nazis]] joined its ranks.

When Glimmerveen revealed his sympathy for [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Anton Mussert]] and the NVU became more and more a [[Nazism|Nazi]] party, support for the party collapsed and it was forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.nvu.info/gesch.html ''NVU - Geschiedenis'' (NVU History)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.annefrank.org/ond_upload/Downloads/NVUarrest1978.pdf ''Verbodenverklaring, geen ontbinding Nederlandse Volks Unie (NVU)'']&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a mistake in the law, the NVU managed to continue after it was forbidden. Some members formed the [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|''Centrumpartij'']] (CP), which later split into the [[Centre Democrats (Netherlands)|''Centrum Demokraten'' (CD)]] and CP'86. In the mid-eighties, the NVU collapsed completely.
[[File:NVU-demonstratie Arnhem 2010.jpg|thumb|NVU march in 2010]]

In 1996, a few young neo-National Socialists asked Joop Glimmerveen, then 68 years of age, to start the NVU again and he did. In 1998, they tried to enter the city council elections in Den Haag and Arnhem, but did not succeed. At this moment, the NVU is the most active party on the extreme right in the Netherlands and gets support from the ''[[Aktiefront Nationale Socialisten]]'' (ANS), a small organization of activists who claim solidarity with the plight of the Palestinians and other groups which they consider to be anti-imperialist. The number of members of the NVU is unknown.

== Criticism ==
One of the biggest critics of current NVU's leader [[Constant Kusters]] is Joop Glimmerveen, the face and leader of the NVU since the beginning of the 1970s and party ideologist until the end of the 1990s. In 1996 after almost 11 years of inactivity, Glimmerveen handed the NVU over to Kusters and [[Eite Homan]].

Glimmerveen gave up NVU membership in 1994 but kept control of the editorial rights of the party magazine Wij Nederland. Kusters writes and edits the party newspaper Wij Europa but Glimmerveen cannot stand either its ideological course or its 'shoddy production'.

In 2003, Glimmerveen published a special edition of Wij Nederland full of letters to Kusters, the latter's answers, and his own vision of the NVU. Among other things, Glimmerveen has charged Kusters with misuse of NVU funds for his own benefit and threatened him with court action.

== Election results ==
The Dutch Peoples-Union participated in city council elections in several cities in 1974, 1986, 2002, 2006 and 2010. In none of these elections they gained enough votes for a seat in the council. They also participated in the [[States-Provincial]] elections in [[Gelderland]] in 2003 and 2007, but here too did not get enough votes for a seat in the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.stembusuitslag.com/ Dutch election results]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, 1981 and 1982 the party participated in elections for the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] (''Tweede Kamer''), but did not get a seat in the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://dnpp.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/publicatieLucardie/right-wing/rightextrem00.pdf ''Right-Wing Extremism in the Netherlands''], table 1, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GabcikovoStauwerk.jpg|thumb|Gabčíkovo – Nagymaros Dams]]
[[File:Gabčíkovo - Vodné dielo.jpg|thumb|Gabčíkovo - Aerial view]]
The '''Gabčíkovo–Nagymaros Dams''' (more precisely ''Gabčíkovo–Nagymaros Waterworks'', {{lang-hu|Bős–nagymarosi vízlépcső}}, ''[[Slovak language|Slovak]]: Sústava vodných diel Gabčíkovo – Nagymaros'') is a large barrage project on the [[Danube]]. It was initiated by the Budapest Treaty of 16 September 1977 between the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] and the [[People's Republic of Hungary]]. The project aimed at preventing catastrophic floods, improving river navigability and producing clean electricity.

Only a part of the project has been finished in [[Slovakia]], under the name ''Gabčíkovo Dam'', because [[Hungary]] first suspended, then tried to terminate, the project due to environmental and economic concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Schwabach, [http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1149&amp;context=bjil Diverting the Danube: The Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Dispute and International Freshwater Law], 1996, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Slovakia proceeded with an alternative solution, called "Variant C", which involved diverting the Danube, the [[Border river#Natural borders|border river]]. These caused a still unresolved international dispute between Slovakia and Hungary. Both parties turned to the [[International Court of Justice]] for a ruling.

== Budapest Treaty ==
The joint Hungarian–Czechoslovak project was agreed upon on 16 September 1977 in the "Budapest Treaty". The treaty envisioned a cross-border barrage system between the towns of [[Gabčíkovo]], Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (now Slovak Republic) and [[Nagymaros]], People's Republic of Hungary (now Hungary). The dams would eliminate regular flooding (like the disastrous ones of 1954 and 1965) and provide a clean source of electric power. They would also allow year-long navigability of the river and serve as a part of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal system of inland navigation.

The plan was to divert part of the river into an artificial canal at [[Dunakiliti]] (a village in Hungary) to the hydroelectric power plant near Gabčíkovo (eight turbines, 720 [[Megawatt|MW]]). The canal would return the water into a deepened original riverbed and at Nagymaros a smaller dam and power-plant (158 MW) would be constructed. The plant in Gabčíkovo was to be a peak-power plant and the dam in Nagymaros, about 100&amp;nbsp;km downstream, was to limit fluctuations of the water level.

Because most of the construction was planned to occur in Slovak territory, the Hungarian government was obligated to participate in some construction in Slovakia, to ensure equal investment by both sides. Electricity produced was to be shared equally between the two countries.

An important provision of the treaty was its Article 15.1, which stated: "''the Contracting Parties shall ensure, by the means specified in the joint contractual plan, that the quality of the water in the Danube is not impaired as a result of the construction and operation of the System of Locks''".&lt;ref&gt;P. K. Rao: International Environmental Law and Economics, Blackwell Publishers Ltd., 2002, page 230 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HGch-zKs0M4C&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=Bos-Nagymaros+Dams+%22International+Court+at+The+Hague%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Am4OT8SXCMXMmAWo4d3KAw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bos-Nagymaros%20Dams%20%22International%20Court%20at%20The%20Hague%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limited project ==
In 1981 the two countries agreed to slow down the project because of their economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.szigetkoz.biz/tortenet/mainpage.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|this looks like a blog entry|date=November 2012}} In 1984 a movement protesting against the dam, the "Danube Circle" ([[Duna Kör]]), was founded in Hungary, which was later awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rightlivelihood.org/duna-kor.html |title=Duna Kör / Janos Vargha (Hungary) |publisher=Right Livelihood Award |accessdate=21 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130142121/http://rightlivelihood.org/duna-kor.html |archivedate=30 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]]&lt;ref name=goldman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/node/171 |title=Europe 1990. János Vargha. Hungary. Rivers &amp; Dams |publisher=Goldman Environmental Prize |accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for protecting the Danube. The group objected to the withholding of information on the project from the public by the Communist government to avoid debate on its environmental impact. Biologists worried that the dams would damage both the treasured scenery of the [[Danube Bend]] and the [[underground water]] reserves on which more than a million Hungarians depend,&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VzweAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Gab%C4%8D%C3%ADkovo+%E2%80%93+Nagymaros+Dams+%22International+Court+at+The+Hague%22&amp;dq=Gab%C4%8D%C3%ADkovo+%E2%80%93+Nagymaros+Dams+%22International+Court+at+The+Hague%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5WcOT62iGLCTiQeekMEd&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ New scientist, Volume 143, Issues 73–74, page 28]&lt;/ref&gt; especially around [[Budapest]]. After an intensive campaign the project became widely hated in Hungary as a symbol of the old regime. In Slovakia, construction continued and many people were involved in building the hydro-electric plant. The Hungarian government eventually decided to suspend work until the environmental effects of the project were fully assessed.&lt;ref name=McIntyre&gt;Owen McIntyre: ''Gabčíkovo – Nagymaros Project: A Test Case for International Water Law?'', In: Anton Earle, Anders Jagerskog and Joakim Öjendal (editors): ''Transboundary Water Management: Principles and Practice'', Stockholm International Water Institute, 2010, page 228 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mrncsakXkwkC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=Judgment+of+the+International+Court+Slovakia+Hungary+Gab%C4%8D%C3%ADkovo+%E2%80%93+Nagymaros+Dams+damages&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_W6bUJjRH4iziQeR_oCwDg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Judgment%20of%20the%20International%20Court%20Slovakia%20Hungary%20Gab%C4%8D%C3%ADkovo%20%E2%80%93%20Nagymaros%20Dams%20damages&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the Slovak authorities decided to unilaterally proceed with an alternative solution, called "Variant C".&lt;ref name=McIntyre /&gt; This effectively diverted the Danube into Slovak territory and kept the development entirely within its borders.&lt;ref name=McIntyre /&gt; This scheme dramatically reduced the amount of water flowing into Hungary and had a significant impact on that nation's water supply and environment.&lt;ref name=McIntyre /&gt; As a result, the Hungarian government attempted to terminate the 1977 Treaty.

The 7 proposals originally put forward by experts from Czechoslovakia in 1992 were as follows.

|Reduce the reservoir, build the waterworks only on the territory of the Slovak Republic and postpone construction at Nagymaros in Hungary. Split the shared reservoir into two with a dam and instead of the dam in [[Dunakiliti]] build a dam in [[Čunovo]]. This variant is called temporal, as it is technically possible to build the Dunakiliti dam and flood the Čunovo dam in order to finish the waterworks according to the 1977 treaty.

&lt;/div&gt;

In the end it was decided to switch to an alternative solution on a smaller scale, Proposal C. The artificial canal would start at [[Čunovo]], part of the Slovak capital city [[Bratislava]], and the Gabčíkovo power plant would operate in run-of-the-river mode with no water level fluctuation. Construction started in November 1991. In October 1992 diversion of part of the water into the canal started and the Čunovo reservoir was filled; the secondary structures (such as the power-plant) were finished and made operational in 1996.

== Parts of the waterworks ==

=== Built parts ===
[[File:DSCN1028.JPG|right|thumb|Hydroelectric power station at Gabčíkovo Dam]]
* '''Supply channel for Čunovo Dam''' conveys water from Bratislava about 10&amp;nbsp;km to Čunovo.
* '''Čunovo Dam''' is the first level of the Waterworks, producing 24&amp;nbsp;MW of electricity, and there is an additional smaller power plant with 1&amp;nbsp;MW power output. Čunovo includes also the [[Čunovo Water Sports Centre]], a site of world championships in water slalom and rafting.
* '''Hrušov reservoir''' (replacing the joint Slovak-Hungarian Dunakiliti reservoir) accumulates water for the main power plant in Gabčíkovo and also regulates water level. It is 16&amp;nbsp;km long and from 1 to 4&amp;nbsp;km wide. Its capacity is 196&amp;nbsp;million cubic metres. As part of the Proposal C redesign, the reservoir was reduced in size and separated from Hungarian territory by a 10.5&amp;nbsp;km long embankment.
* '''Gabčíkovo Dam''' is the main part of the waterworks. It consists of two main structures: a hydropower plant and two lock chambers. This level of the waterworks was designed to use differential water level to produce electricity, to allow ships to pass safely through locks and to divert flood water. The chambers are on the left bank of the Danube and the difference in water levels is about 20&amp;nbsp;metres. The power plant on the right riverbank was designed to produce 2650&amp;nbsp;GWh annually. A 10&amp;nbsp;m wide road bridge passes over the complex. Operation of the power plant is fully automated. In 2012, after 20 years of service, 300.000 ships have passed through the locks with totally 5.000.000 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teraz.sk/slovensko/gabcikovom-sa-za-20-rokov-jeho-existen/27633-clanok.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Outlet channel''' leads water back to the old riverbed and also helps against floods. The channel is 185&amp;nbsp;m wide at the bottom and 8.2&amp;nbsp;km long and re-enters the Danube at [[Sap (village)|Sap]].
* '''Regulations''' in the old Danube riverbed.&lt;ref name="vvb"&gt;http://www.vvb.sk/cms/index.php?page=svd-gabcikovo-nagymaros&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nagymaros ===
The waterworks on the Danube were designed to have an additional level at Nagymaros, consisting of a reservoir 95&amp;nbsp;km long and the Nagymaros power plant. This level was to be located between the Hungarian towns of [[Visegrád]] and [[Nagymaros]] and its purpose was to use the gradient of the reservoir for production of electricity and also to allow ships to pass. The Gabčíkovo works were designed for control and peak running of the power plant, and the Nagymaros works as an equalising power plant to provide better conditions for shipping and to regulate peak outflow from Gabčíkovo. Because the Nagymaros works were not built, the Gabčíkovo power plant cannot work at peak efficiency, which causes appreciable economic damage.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
Non-existence of Nagymaros dam also causes main obstacle of inland navigation on the 2400&amp;nbsp;km Danube Pan-European corridor due to low levels of water. Hungary requests Slovakia to manage regulation works on problematic stretch of Danube that had to be solved by Nagymaros backwater. Transportation damages include also missing upgrade of river Váh waterway in Slovakia.&lt;ref name="vvb"/&gt;

== Lawsuit ==
After [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia split up]] in 1993, the newly established [[Slovak Republic]] carried on with the project. In 1989 Hungary abandoned the site when scientists on both sides of the border expressed fears about the environmental consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VzweAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22scientists+on+both+sides+of+the+border+expressed+fears%22&amp;dq=%22scientists+on+both+sides+of+the+border+expressed+fears%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U3MOT72gDo-hiQeLt6xB&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA New scientist, Volume 143, Issues 73–74, page 28]&lt;/ref&gt; After Hungary tried to terminate the 1977 treaty in May 1992 both&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"/&gt;
parties (Hungary and Slovakia) agreed to take their dispute to the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[The Hague]].
In 1994, the Socialists came back into power in Hungary but could hardly back out of the court case, which was hailed as a landmark: for the first time, the court would rule over an environmental dispute. Hearings on the case were held between 3 March and 15 April 1997, and the Court paid a site visit (the first ever in its history). Besides other issues, the Hungarian representatives wanted the court to decide whether or not Czechoslovakia was entitled to embark on Proposal C, and to rule that the 1977 treaty was not binding on Slovakia and Hungary. The court handed down a decision in 1997:
* The Court found that Hungary had breached their legal obligations in almost all points. It ordered Hungary to finish the Nagymaros part of waterworks. Per Court decision, Czecho-Slovakia and later Slovakia was entitled to build alternative workaround after Hungary stopped its work, but Slovakia breached on one point - it should not have started to operate alternative temporary solution before court finished. It called on both States to negotiate in good faith in order to ensure the achievement of the objectives of the 1977 Budapest Treaty, which it declared was still in force, while taking account of the factual situation that had developed since 1989.&lt;ref&gt; 
''Report of the International Court of Justice, 1 August 2005, – 31 July 2006'', United Nations Publications, 2006, page 25 [https://books.google.com/books?id=DSUFz5Rw5yYC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=Judgment+of+the+International+Court+1997+Slovakia+Hungary&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ymubULmyAonqmAXC44DgBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Judgment%20of%20the%20International%20Court%201997%20Slovakia%20Hungary&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each Party must compensate the other Party for the damage caused by its conduct.&lt;ref&gt;

Another 4 months of negotiations between Slovakia and Hungary led to a treaty between the two countries about the ICJ judgment. In March 1998 the government of Slovakia approved this treaty, but the government of Hungary, which was supposed to build Nagymaros or a Pilismarót waterworks, delayed approving the treaty and proclaimed a competition for the project. After elections in Hungary, the new government cancelled this competition.&lt;ref name="gabcikovo.gov.sk"/&gt; In 1998, after two appeals to Hungary, the Slovak government turned to the International Court, demanding the Nagymaros part be built. As of 2006, the international dispute was still not resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slovakspectator.sk/clanok.asp?cl=21981 |title=Slovakia again discussing completion of Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros |work= [[The Slovak Spectator]]|accessdate=23 February 2008|date=4 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The area of the Čunovo reservoir is 40&amp;nbsp;km², exclusively on the Slovak side (the original Hrušov-Dunakiliti reservoir was to be 60&amp;nbsp;km²). The operational water level is 131.1&amp;nbsp;metres above sea level (minimal and maximum levels are 129 and 131.5&amp;nbsp;m respectively).
* The power station has eight vertical [[Kaplan turbine]]s with runners 9.3&amp;nbsp;m in diameter and a maximum capacity of 90&amp;nbsp;MW each. Total capacity is 720&amp;nbsp;MW at operational discharge of 4000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s. Water level differences are 24 and 12.88&amp;nbsp;m.
* The original river bed has a discharge of between 250 and 600&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s.
* Two navigation locks were built. A bypass canal will handle floods.
* In 1996, Europe's largest [[artificial whitewater]] slalom course, the [[Water Sports Centre Čunovo]], was built on a river island at the head of the bypass canal. When operating at capacity, it diverts 22&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s into the bypass canal.
* The Gabčíkovo Hydroelectric Power Station produces 2600&amp;nbsp;[[GWh]] of electricity annually, making it the largest hydroelectric plant in Slovakia. It supplies around 8% of the country's electricity consumption.

== Environmental consequences ==
Regarding the environmental consequences of the dam, results of a 1996–2002 study by K. Holubová, Z. Capeková and J. Szolgay&lt;ref name="Greco"&gt;Massimo Greco, Armando Carravetta, Renata Della Morte, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o0nL4GQCyuQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=River+Flow+2004,+Volume+1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S_SeUI-JAaWq0AXP3YCIDQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA River Flow 2004, Volume 1], Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004, pp. 138–141&lt;/ref&gt; were:
* Intensive degradation of the Danube River bed downstream (especially at the Old Danube river bed) caused by the absence of the Nagymaros wateworks.&lt;ref name="Greco"/&gt;
* Decreased water level,&lt;ref name="Greco"/&gt;
* Increased sediment supply,&lt;ref name="Greco"/&gt;
* Increased amounts of bedload and higher intensity of bedload movements,&lt;ref name="Greco"/&gt;
* Reduced flood capacity,&lt;ref name="Greco"/&gt;
* Decreased channel stability,&lt;ref name="Greco"/&gt;

Annual joint studies of the Slovak-Hungarian governments claim:
* Stabilization of groundwater levels, local improvement of groundwater quality,&lt;ref name="monitor"&gt;[http://www.gabcikovo.gov.sk/monitor.htm Environmental monitoring]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATO"&gt;http://www.gabcikovo.gov.sk/doc/NATO/nato.htm Groundwater quality processes 
after the bank infiltration from the Danube at Čunovo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="report"&gt;[http://www.vvb.sk/monitoring/2008/ Monitoring of influence of Gabčíkovo waterworks on environment, 2008 report]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stabilization of the riverbed of the old Danube.&lt;ref name="NATO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jar"&gt;[http://www.gabcikovo.gov.sk/doc/jr2011en/ Joint annual report on the environment monitoring in 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Improved living conditions of aquatic animals and forest animals in areas around old Danube.&lt;ref name="jar"/&gt;{{Verify source|date=June 2013}}

Differences between 2002 study and newer works may be attributed to size of studied area. As 1996–2002 study was done on area from [[Vienna]] to end of Slovak-Hungarian Danube. Government studies are targeting only Gabčíkovo waterworks and immediate area around it.

Groundwater levels are dependent on big floods, like in 2002, which removed fine [[silt]] from river bottom and allowed increased filtration. After that groundwater levels on many places reached pre-reservoir filling levels, on some places reached even higher.&lt;ref&gt;Monitoring of the natural environment in the area of influence Gabčíkovo [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=sk&amp;sl=sk&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vvb.sk%2Fmonitoring%2F2008%2FSprava_monitoring_VDG_2008_ZAVERY_a_ODPORUCANIA.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
Damming of the Danube improved ground water quality at [[Rusovce]] and [[Čuňovo]] water supply&lt;ref&gt;Slovak – Hungarian Environmental Monitoring on the Danube [http://www.gabcikovo.gov.sk/doc/moson/kapitola3b.htm#III-2-5], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; which are on right side of Danube. It was due changed infiltration conditions and changed groundwater flow direction from NW-SE to N-S.&lt;ref&gt;Ground water regime monitoring [http://www.gabcikovo.gov.sk/doc/moson/ppt/HlavatyBansky.pdf], page 5&lt;/ref&gt; The ground water quality at water supplies situated on the left side of the Danube were not influenced to the same extent as on the right side.

One of the same problems identified is increased sedimentation upstream and riverbed erosion downstream from reservoir, which is a typical [[Environmental impacts of reservoirs#Reservoir sedimentation|problem]] of water reservoirs.

'''Hegemony''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|h|ɪ|ˈ|ɡ|ɛ|m|ən|i|,_|h|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|m|ən|i}}, {{IPAc-en|US|h|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|m|ən|i}} ({{pronunciation|En-us-hegemony.ogg}}) or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|dʒ|ə|ˌ|m|oʊ|n|i}}) is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one [[State (polity)|state]] over others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hegemony|year=2014|work=Oxford Advanced American Dictionary|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|url=http://oaadonline.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/hegemony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Hegemony|year= 2014|work=Merriam-Webster Online|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hegemony|accessdate= 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Hegemony|year=2014|work= American Heritage Dictionary|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url= http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=hegemony&amp;submit.x=22&amp;submit.y=22 |accessdate= 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Greece]] (8th century BC – 6th century AD), hegemony denoted the politico-military dominance of a [[city-state]] over other city-states.&lt;ref name="TheColumbia"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Columbia Encyclopedia|edition=Fifth|year=1994|location=New York |publisher= Columbia University Press |isbn= 0-231-08098-0|editor-first=Barbara A.|editor-last=Chernow|editor2-first= George A.|editor2-last=Vallasi |page=1215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant state is known as the ''hegemon''.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'': "A leading or paramount power; a dominant state or person"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, hegemony came to denote the "Social or cultural predominance or ascendancy; predominance by one group within a society or milieu". Later, it could be used to mean "a group or regime which exerts undue influence within a society".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'': Def's 2a and 2b.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it could be used for the geopolitical and the cultural predominance of one country over others, from which was derived ''hegemonism'', as in the idea that the [[Great power|Great Powers]] meant to establish [[European colonialism|European hegemony]] over [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Fontana"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Alan |editor1-last=Bullock |editor2-first= Stephen |editor2-last=Trombley |title=The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought |edition=Third |year=1999 |location= London |publisher=HarperCollins |pages=387–388 |isbn= 0-00-255871-8}}{{Request quotation|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[international relations theory]], hegemony denotes a situation of (i) great material asymmetry in favour of one state, who has (ii) enough military power to systematically defeat any potential contester in the system, (iii) controls the access to raw materials, natural resources, capital and markets, (iv) has competitive advantages in the production of value added goods, (v) generates an accepted ideology reflecting this status quo; and (vi) is functionally differentiated from other states in the system, being expected to provide certain public goods such as security, or commercial and financial stability.

The [[Marxist]] theory of [[cultural hegemony]], associated particularly with [[Antonio Gramsci]], is the idea that the [[ruling class]] can manipulate the [[value system]] and [[mores]] of a society, so that their view becomes the world view (''[[Weltanschauung]]''): in Terry Eagleton's words, "Gramsci normally uses the word hegemony to mean the ways in which a governing power wins consent to its rule from those it subjugates".&lt;ref&gt;Terry Eagleton, ''Ideology: An Introduction'' (London: Verso, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] rule, cultural hegemony "is hegemonic only if those affected by it also consent to and struggle over its common sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Masculinity Studies and the Jargon of Strategy: Hegemony, Tautology, Sense |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |newspaper=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912537 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:362BCThebanHegemony.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Ancient Greece]] under the hegemony of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], 371–362 BC]]

In [[cultural imperialism]], the leader state dictates the internal politics and the [[Society|societal]] character of the subordinate states that constitute the hegemonic [[sphere of influence]], either by an internal, sponsored government or by an external, installed government.

==Etymology==
[[File:Map Macedonia 336 BC-en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The League of Corinth hegemony: the Kingdom of Macedonia (362 BC) (red) and the Corinthian League (yellow)]]
From the post-classical Latin word ''hegemonia'' (from 1513 or earlier) from the Greek word ἡγεμονία ''hēgemonía'', meaning "authority, rule, political supremacy", related to the word ἡγεμών ''hēgemōn'' "leader".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 8th–1st centuries BC ===
In the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco–Roman]] world of 5th century BC European [[classical antiquity]], the [[city-state]] of [[Sparta]] was the ''hegemon'' of the [[Peloponnesian League]] (6th to 4th centuries BC) and King [[Philip II of Macedon]] was the hegemon of the [[League of Corinth]] in 337 BC (a kingship he willed to his son, [[Alexander the Great]]). Likewise, the role of [[Athens]] within the short-lived [[Delian League]] (478–404 BC) was that of a "hegemon".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', "Greeks, Romans, and barbarians (from Europe, history of)": "Fusions of power occurred in the shape of leagues of cities, such as the Peloponnesian League, the Delian League, and the Boeotian League. The efficacy of these leagues depended chiefly upon the hegemony of a leading city (Sparta, Athens, or Thebes)"&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient historians such as [[Xenophon]] and [[Ephorus]] were the first who used the term in its modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Wickersham, JM., [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9_7b1J19i0C&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=hegemony+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OgNhVOyUF8iHsQTNzoKABA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hegemony%20history&amp;f=false ''Hegemony and Greek Historians'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1994, p. x.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient [[East Asia]], Chinese hegemony existed during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (c. 770–480 BC), when the weakened rule of the [[Eastern Zhou Dynasty]] led to the relative autonomy of the [[Five Hegemons (Spring and Autumn period)|Five Hegemons]] (''Ba'' in Chinese [霸]). They were appointed by [[Feudalism|feudal]] lord conferences, and thus were nominally obliged to uphold the [[imperium]] of the Zhou Dynasty over the subordinate states.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', "Ch'i":
"As a result, Ch'i began to dominate most of China proper; in 651 BC it formed the little states of the area into a league, which was successful in staving off invasions from the semibarbarian regimes to the north and south. Although Ch'i thus gained hegemony over China, its rule was short-lived; after Duke Huan's death, internal disorders caused it to lose the leadership of the new confederation"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1st–14th centuries AD ===
1st and 2nd century Europe was dominated by the hegemonic peace of the ''[[Pax Romana]]''. It was instituted by the emperor [[Augustus]], and was accompanied by a series of brutal military campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Parchami, A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pwt6AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=rome+hegemony+-%22hegemony+rome%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7kfL8Q8S1s&amp;sig=dyHecMOG4obvHSA9QCPMjfGYkqg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bHOAVO2fB9GrafPXgLAD&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBjgK#v=snippet&amp;q=hegemony%20rome&amp;f=false ''Hegemonic Peace and Empire: The Pax Romana, Britannica and Americana''], Routledge, 2009, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 7th century to the 12th century, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] and later [[Abbasid Caliphate]] dominated the vast territories they governed, with other states like the [[Byzantine Empire]] paying tribute.&lt;ref&gt;al-Tabari, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1Oe16n-tfBEC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=al-tabari+umayyad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBWoVChMIsOjD85iJxwIVSmsUCh2p7QII#v=onepage&amp;q=al-tabari%20umayyad&amp;f=false ''The History of al-Tabari'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 7th century India, [[Harsha]], ruler of a large empire in northern India from AD&amp;nbsp;606 to 647, brought most of the north under his hegemony. He preferred not to rule as a central government, but left "conquered kings on their thrones and contenting himself with tribute and homage."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/256065/Harsha "Harsha"]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 9th to the early 11th century, the empire developed by [[Charlemagne]] achieved hegemony in Europe, with dominance over France, Italy and [[Burgundy]].&lt;ref&gt;Story, J.

During the 14th century, the [[Crown of Aragon]] became the hegemon in the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref&gt;The Crown of Aragon: A Singular Mediterranean Empire. {{ISBN|978-90-04-34960-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 15th–19th centuries ===
In ''The Politics of International Political Economy'', Jayantha Jayman writes "If we consider the [[Western world|Western]] dominated global system from as early as the 15th century, there have been several hegemonic powers and contenders that have attempted to create the world order in their own images." He lists several contenders for historical hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;Jayman. J., in Vassilis K. Fouskas, VK., [https://books.google.com/books?id=xCBHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=hegemony+15th+century&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fMBgVK2tMrj8sAS-3ILoAQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=hegemony%2015th%20century&amp;f=false ''The Politics of International Political Economy''], Routledge, 2014, pp. 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

[[Philip IV of Spain|Phillip IV]] tried to restore the Habsburg dominance but, by the middle of the 17th century "Spain's pretensions to hegemony (in Europe) had definitely and irremediably failed."&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'':[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/456194/Philip-IV "Phillip IV"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/557573/Spain/70415/The-last-years-of-Philip-IV "Spain under the Habsburgs].&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In late 16th and 17th-century Holland, the Dutch Republic's [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] dominion was an early instance of commercial hegemony, made feasible with the development of wind power for the efficient production and delivery of goods and services. This, in turn, made possible the Amsterdam [[stock market]] and concomitant dominance of world trade.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', "Financial and economic affairs. (from Colbert, Jean-Baptiste)".&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (1638–1715) and ([[Emperor of the French|Emperor]]) [[Napoleon]] I (1799–1815) attempted French true hegemony via economic, cultural and military domination of most of [[Continental Europe]]. However, Jeremy Black writes that, because of Britain, France "was unable to enjoy the benefits" of this hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;Black, J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=3qV8GPUJkyEC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=hegemony+napoleon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BMZgVICfH63CsAS7uYKgCw&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hegemony%20napoleon&amp;f=false ''Great Powers and the Quest for Hegemony: The World Order Since 1500''], Routledge, 2007, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat and exile of Napoleon, hegemony largely passed to the [[British Empire]], which became the largest empire in history, with [[Queen Victoria]] (1837–1901) ruling over one-quarter of the world's land and population at its zenith.  Like the Dutch, the British Empire was primarily seaborne; many British possessions were located around the rim of the [[Indian Ocean]], as well as numerous islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Britain also controlled the [[Indian subcontinent]] and large portions of [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter, A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=CTkb4yIR8pIC&amp;dq=hegemony+british+emp+iii&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume III: The Nineteenth Century''], Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, Germany, rather than Britain, may have been the strongest power after 1871, but Samuel Newland writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Bismarck defined the road ahead as … no expansion, no push for hegemony in Europe. Germany was to be the strongest power in Europe but without being a hegemon. … His basic axioms were first, no conflict among major powers in Central Europe; and second, German security without German hegemony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newland |first=Samuel J |title=Victories Are Not Enough: Limitations of the German Way of War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ehS8Dg8sdQC&amp;pg=PA30 |publisher=DIANE Publishing |year=2005 |page=30 |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== 20th century ===
The early 20th century, like the late 19th century was characterized by multiple [[Great Powers]] but no global hegemon. World War I weakened the strongest of the [[Imperialism|Imperial Powers]], Great Britain, but also strengthened the United States and, to a lesser extent, Japan. Both of these states' governments pursued policies to expand their regional [[spheres of influence]], the US in [[Banana Wars|Latin America]] and Japan in [[Empire of Japan|East Asia]]. France, the UK, Italy, the Soviet Union and later [[Nazi Germany]] (1933–1945) all either maintained imperialist policies based on spheres of influence or attempted to conquer territory but none achieved the status of a global hegemonic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |title=Why Orwell Matters |year=2002 |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |pages=86–87 |isbn=0-465-03049-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], the [[United Nations]] was established and the five strongest global powers (China, France, the UK, the US, and the USSR) were given permanent seats on the [[U.N. Security Council]], the organization's most powerful decision making body. Following the war, the US and the USSR were the two strongest global powers and this created a bi-polar power dynamic in international affairs, commonly referred to as the [[Cold War]]. The hegemonic conflict was [[Ideology|ideological]], between [[communism]] and [[capitalism]], as well as geopolitical, between the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries (1955–1991) and [[NATO]]/[[SEATO]]/[[CENTO]] countries (1949–present). During the Cold War both hegemons competed against each other directly (during the [[arms race]]) and indirectly (via [[proxy war]]s). The result was that many countries, no matter how remote, were drawn into the conflict when it was suspected that their governments' policies might destabilize the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]. Reinhard Hildebrandt calls this a period of "dual-hegemony", where "two dominant states have been stabilizing their European spheres of influence ''against and alongside each other''."&lt;ref&gt;Hilderbrandt, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=FavTTdW2YqEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=hegemony+USA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SIFfVMGHF4KP7AbStoDIDA&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cold%20war%22%20hegemony&amp;f=false ''US Hegemony: Global Ambitions and Decline : Emergence of the Interregional Asian Triangle and the Relegation of the US as a Hegemonic Power, the Reorientation of Europe''], Peter Lang, 2009, p. 14. (Author's italics).&lt;/ref&gt; 
Proxy wars became battle grounds between forces supported either directly or indirectly by the hegemonic powers and included the [[Korean War]], the [[Laotian Civil War]], the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan War]], the [[Angolan Civil War]], and the [[Central American crisis|Central American Civil Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=3UgSAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=proxy+wars&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Proxy Warfare''], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013, pp. 46–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 the United States was the world's sole hegemonic power.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrandt, R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=FavTTdW2YqEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=hegemony+USA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SIFfVMGHF4KP7AbStoDIDA&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hegemony%20USA&amp;f=false ''US Hegemony: Global Ambitions and Decline : Emergence of the Interregional Asian Triangle and the Relegation of the US as a Hegemonic Power, the Reorientation of Europe''], Peter Lang, 2009, pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===
Various perspectives on whether the US was or continues to be a hegemon have been presented since the end of the [[Cold War]]. The American political scientists [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Joseph Nye]] have argued that the US is not a true hegemon because it has neither the financial nor the military resources to impose a proper, formal, global hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph S., Sr. |last=Nye |title=Understanding International Conflicts: An Introduction to Theory and History |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |pages=276–77 |isbn=0-06-500720-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Anna Cornelia Beyer, in her book about counter-terrorism, argues that [[global governance]] is a product of American leadership and describes it as hegemonic governance.&lt;ref name="Beyer" /&gt;

The [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist]] politician [[Hubert Védrine]] in 1999 described the US as a hegemonic [[hyperpower]], because of its unilateral military actions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, JIM., [https://books.google.com/books?id=p6LwocQyz44C&amp;pg=PA82 ''Religion and Global Culture: New Terrain in the Study of Religion and the Work of Charles H.

In his view the transformation proved to be fatal and eventually led to the fall of the Roman Empire. His book {{According to whom|gives implicit advice|date=March 2017}} to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to continue the present hegemonic strategy and refrain from establishing an empire.

In 2006, author [[Zhu Zhiqun]] claimed that China is already on the way to becoming the world hegemon and that the focus should be on how a peaceful transfer of power can be achieved between the US and China&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=US-China relations in the 21st century : power transition and peace|last=Zhiqun|first=Zhu|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0-415-70208-9|location=London ; New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but has faced opposition to this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/yanzhonghuang/2017/08/29/chinas-superpower-status-not-enough-to-replace-u-s-as-global-leader-yet/|title=Forbes Yanz Hong Huang|author=|date=|website=www.forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gramsci.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937), the [[Intellectual|theoretician]] of [[cultural hegemony]]]]

In the historical writing of the 19th century, the denotation of ''hegemony'' extended to describe the predominance of one country upon other countries; and, by extension, ''hegemonism'' denoted the Great Power politics (c. 1880s – 1914) for establishing hegemony (indirect imperial rule), that then leads to a definition of [[imperialism]] (direct foreign rule). In the early 20th century, in the field of [[international relations]], the Italian [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist philosopher]] [[Antonio Gramsci]] developed the theory of [[Cultural hegemony|cultural domination]] (an analysis of [[economic class]]) to include [[social class]]; hence, the philosophic and sociologic theory of [[cultural hegemony]] analysed the [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] that established the [[social structure]]s (social and economic classes) with which the [[ruling class]] establish and exert cultural [[Dominance hierarchy|dominance]] to impose their ''[[Weltanschauung]]'' (world view)—justifying the social, political, and economic ''[[status quo]]''—as natural, inevitable, and beneficial to every social class, rather than as artificial [[social construct]]s beneficial solely to the ruling class.&lt;ref name="TheColumbia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fontana" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K.

From the Gramsci analysis derived the [[political science]] denotation of hegemony as ''leadership''; thus, the historical example of [[Prussia]] as the militarily and culturally predominant province of the [[German Empire]] (Second Reich 1871–1918); and the personal and intellectual predominance of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]] upon the [[French Consulate]] (1799–1804).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Chris |last=Cook |title=Dictionary of Historical Terms |year=1983 |location=London |publisher=MacMillan |page=142 |isbn=0-333-44972-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporarily, in ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]'' (1985), [[Ernesto Laclau]] and [[Chantal Mouffe]] defined hegemony as a political relationship of [[power (philosophy)|power]] wherein a sub-ordinate society (collectivity) perform social tasks that are culturally unnatural and not beneficial to them, but that are in exclusive benefit to the [[Imperialism|imperial]] interests of the hegemon, the superior, ordinate power; hegemony is a military, political, and economic relationship that occurs as an [[Articulation (sociology)|articulation]] within political [[discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernest |last=Laclau |first2=Chantal |last2=Mouffe |title=Hegemony and Socialist Strategy |edition=Second |year=2001 |location=London |publisher=Verso |pages=40–59, 125–44 |isbn=1-85984-330-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyer analysed the contemporary hegemony of the United States at the example of the Global War on Terrorism and presented the mechanisms and processes of American exercise of power in 'hegemonic governance'.&lt;ref name="Beyer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beyer |first=Anna Cornelia |title=Counterterrorism and International Power Relations |year=2010 |location=London |publisher=I.

Academics have argued that in the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] of hegemony, imperial dominance is established by means of [[cultural imperialism]], whereby the leader state (hegemon) dictates the internal politics and the [[Society|societal]] character of the subordinate states that constitute the hegemonic [[sphere of influence]], either by an internal, sponsored government or by an external, installed government. The imposition of the hegemon's way of life—an imperial ''[[lingua franca]]'' and [[Bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] (social, economic, educational, governing)—transforms the concrete imperialism of direct military domination into the abstract [[Political power|power]] of the ''status quo'', indirect imperial domination.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=kG2hAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=impose+cultural+imperialism&amp;q=%22power+imposing%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22power%20imposing%22&amp;f=false ''Imperialism and Postcolonialism''], Routledge, 2014, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have said that this view is "deeply condescending" and "treats people&amp;nbsp;... as blank slates on which global capitalism's moving finger writes its message, leaving behind another cultural automaton as it moves on."&lt;ref&gt;Brutt-Griffler, J., in Karlfried Knapp, Barbara Seidlhofer, H. G. Widdowson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3klgGNmjVpEC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=impose+cultural+imperialism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4fFgVJe-L6jLsAT7soGgCg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=impose%20cultural%20imperialism&amp;f=false ''Handbook of Foreign Language Communication and Learning''], Walter de Gruyter, 2009, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggested examples of cultural imperialism include the latter-stage [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[British Empire]]s, the 19th- and 20th-century [[Reich]]s of [[German Unification|unified Germany]] (1871–1945),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry |last=Kissinger |authorlink=Henry Kissinger |title=Diplomacy |year=1994 |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-65991-X |pages=137–38 |quote=European coalitions were likely to arise to contain Germany's Nazis growing, potentially dominant, power}} As well as p. 145: "Unified Germany was achieving the strength to dominate Europe all by itself—an occurrence which Great Britain had always resisted in the past when it came about by conquest".&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of the 20th century, the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally, hegemony also is established by means of [[language]], specifically the imposed ''lingua franca'' of the hegemon (leader state), which then is the official source of [[information]] for the people of the society of the sub-ordinate state. Writing on language and power, Andrea Mayr says, "As a practice of power, hegemony operates largely through language."&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=nIjpTHCNYsUC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=language+hegemony&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6NtfVO74C8qu7AamioDoAw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20hegemony&amp;f=false ''Language and Power: An Introduction to Institutional Discourse''], A&amp;C Black,  2008, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary society, an example of the use of language in this way is in the way Western countries set up educational systems in African countries mediated by Western languages.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, T., [https://books.google.com/books?id=fKQ4csjlktIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=hegemony%20language&amp;f=false ''Rethinking Hegemony''], James Nicholas Publishers, 2006, pp. 202–03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of this is found in the way language helped "diminish the traditions" of African Americans in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Semmes, CE., [https://books.google.com/books?id=OU2vSHLUZuMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=hegemony+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UNFfVKOmN46TsQT7roCwBA&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=hegemony%20language&amp;f=false ''Cultural Hegemony and African American Development''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liberalism]], the belief in [[freedom]] and [[human rights]], is historically associated with thinkers such as [[John Locke]] and [[Montesquieu]]. It is a political movement which spans the better part of the last four centuries, though the use of the word "liberalism" to refer to a specific political doctrine did not occur until the 19th century. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 in [[England]] laid the foundations for the development of the modern liberal state by [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutionally limiting]] the power of the [[monarch]], affirming parliamentary supremacy, passing the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and establishing the principle of "[[consent of the governed]]". The 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of the [[United States]] founded the nascent republic on liberal principles without the encumbrance of hereditary aristocracy—the declaration stated that "all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, among these life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness",&lt;ref&gt;[https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf "The Constitution of the United States"] (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt; echoing John Locke's phrase "life, liberty, and property". A few years later, the [[French Revolution]] overthrew the hereditary aristocracy, with the slogan "liberty, equality, fraternity" and was the first state in history to grant [[universal male suffrage]]. The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], first codified in 1789 in France, is a foundational document of both liberalism and human rights. The intellectual progress of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which questioned old traditions about societies and governments, eventually coalesced into powerful revolutionary movements that toppled what the French called the [[Ancien Régime]], the belief in absolute monarchy and established religion, especially in [[Liberalism in Europe|Europe]], [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|Latin America]] and [[Liberalism in the United States|North America]].

[[William III of England|William Henry of Orange]] in the [[Glorious Revolution]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] in the [[American Revolution]] and [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] in the [[French Revolution]] used liberal philosophy to justify the armed overthrow of what they saw as [[Tyrant|tyrannical]] rule. Liberalism started to spread rapidly especially after the French Revolution. The 19th century saw liberal governments established in nations across Europe, South America and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Kalkman|title=New Liberalism|isbn=978-1-926991-04-7|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, the dominant ideological opponent of [[classical liberalism]] was [[conservatism]], but liberalism later survived major ideological challenges from new opponents, such as [[fascism]] and [[communism]]. Liberal government often adopted the economic beliefs espoused by [[Adam Smith]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and others, which broadly emphasized the importance of [[free market]]s and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' governance, with a minimum of interference in trade.

During 19th and early 20th century in the Ottoman Empire and Middle East, liberalism influenced periods of reform such as the [[Tanzimat]] and [[Nahda]] and the rise of secularism, constitutionalism and nationalism. These changes, along with other factors, helped to create a sense of crisis within Islam which continues to this day—this led to [[Islamic revivalism]]. During the 20th century, liberal ideas spread even further as [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] found themselves on the winning side in both world wars. In Europe and North America, the establishment of [[social liberalism]] (often called simply "[[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]" in the United States) became a key component in the expansion of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] [http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html "Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans"] (1956). ''The Politics of Hope'' (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962). "Liberalism in the U.S. usage has little in common with the word as used in the politics of any other country, save possibly Britain".&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Liberal Party|liberal parties]] continue to wield power and influence [[Liberalism by country|throughout the world]], but it still has challenges to overcome in Africa and Asia. Later waves of modern liberal thought and struggle were strongly influenced by the need to expand [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name="Worell470"&gt;Worell, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals have advocated for [[gender equality]] and [[racial equality]] and a global social movement for civil rights in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards both goals.

== Early history ==

Many of the liberal concepts of Locke were foreshadowed in the radical ideas that were freely aired at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belmont.edu/lockesmith/liberalism_essay/the_rise1.html|title= The Rise, Decline, and Reemergence of Classical Liberalism|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pamphlet]]eer [[Richard Overton (Leveller)|Richard Overton]] wrote: "To every Individuall in nature, is given an individuall property by nature, not to be invaded or usurped by any...; no man hath power over my rights and liberties, and I over no mans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belmont.edu/lockesmith/liberalism_essay/the_rise1.html|title= The Rise, Decline, and Reemergence of Classical Liberalism|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were first unified as a distinct [[ideology]] by the English philosopher [[John Locke]], generally regarded as the father of modern liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Delaney, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Godwin et al., p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke developed the radical notion that government acquires [[Consent of the governed|consent from the governed]], which has to be constantly present for a government to remain legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Copleston, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; His influential ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Two Treatises]]'' (1690), the foundational text of liberal ideology, outlined his major ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; His insistence that lawful government did not have a [[supernatural]] basis was a sharp break from previous theories of governance.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zvesper, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke also defined the concept of the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29. "It took John Locke to translate the demand for liberty of conscience into a systematic argument for distinguishing the realm of government from the realm of religion".&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[social contract]] principle, Locke argued that there was a natural right to the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; He also formulated a general defence for [[religious toleration]] in his ''Letters Concerning Toleration''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alister McGrath|McGrath, Alister]]. 1998. ''Historical Theology, An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 214–215.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke was influenced by the liberal ideas of [[John Milton]], who was a staunch advocate of freedom in all its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Heinrich|last=Bornkamm|language=German|title=Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart – Chapter: Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums&lt;!-- Part of this is the journal name? --&gt;|year=1962|ref=harv}}, 3. Auflage, Band VI, col. 942.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milton argued for [[disestablishment]] as the only effective way of achieving broad [[Religious toleration|toleration]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, William Bridges. ''A Milton Encyclopedia'', Volume 8 (East Brunswick, N.J.: Associated University Presses, 1980). pp. 71–72. {{ISBN|0-8387-1841-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Areopagitica]]'', Milton provided one of the first arguments for the importance of [[freedom of speech]] – "the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties". [[Algernon Sidney]] was second only to John Locke in his influence on liberal political thought in eighteenth-century Britain and Colonial America, and was widely read and quoted by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] opposition during the [[Glorious Revolution]].{{sfn|Scott|2008}} Sidney's argument that "free men always have the right to resist tyrannical government" was widely quoted by the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] at the time of [[American Revolutionary War]]{{sfn|Doherty|2007|p=26}} and [[Thomas Jefferson]] considered Sidney to have been one of the two primary sources for the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]' view of liberty.{{sfn|West|1996|p=xv}} Sidney believed that [[absolute monarchy]] was a great political evil and his major work, ''Discourses Concerning Government'', was written during the [[Exclusion Crisis]], as a response to [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha'', a defence of [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]] monarchy. Sidney firmly rejected the Filmer's reactionary principles and argued that the subjects of the monarch were entitled by right to share in the government through advice and counsel.

Isolated strands of liberal thought that had existed in [[Western philosophy]] since the [[Ancient Greeks]] began to coalesce at the time of the [[English Civil War]]. Disputes between the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] over political supremacy sparked a massive civil war in the 1640s, which culminated in Charles' execution and the establishment of a [[Republic of England|Republic]]. In particular, the [[Levellers]], a radical political movement of the period, published their manifesto ''[[Agreement of the People]]'' which advocated [[popular sovereignty]], an extended voting [[suffrage]], [[religious tolerance]] and [[equality before the law]]. The impact of these ideas steadily increased during the 17th century in England, culminating in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, which enshrined [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and the [[right of revolution]], and led to the establishment of what many consider the first modern, liberal state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oc-uXxPXfmwC|title=1688: The First Modern Revolution|author=Steven Pincus|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-15605-8 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant legislative milestones in this period included the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act of 1679]], which strengthened the convention that forbade detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence.

== Age of Enlightenment ==
{{main article|Age of Enlightenment}}
The development of liberalism continued throughout the 18th century with the burgeoning [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideals]] of the era. This was a period of profound intellectual vitality that questioned old traditions and influenced several European monarchies throughout the 18th century. In contrast to England, the French experience in the 18th century was characterised by the perpetuation of feudal payments and rights and [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. Ideas that challenged the status quo were often harshly repressed. Most of the [[philosophes]] of the [[French Enlightenment]] were progressive in the liberal sense and advocated the reform of the French system of government along more constitutional and liberal lines. The [[American Enlightenment]] is a period of intellectual ferment in the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]] in the period 1714–1818, which led to the [[American Revolution]] and the creation of the American Republic. Influenced by the 18th-century European Enlightenment and its own native [[American Philosophy]], the American Enlightenment applied scientific reasoning to politics, science and religion, promoted religious tolerance, and restored literature, the arts, and music as important disciplines and professions worthy of study in colleges.

[[File:Georg Decker Joseph II.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]] was an archetypal enlightened despot and although he maintained a belief in [[absolutist monarchy]], he also championed a series of liberal reforms]]
A prominent example of a monarch who took the Enlightenment project seriously was [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]], who ruled from 1780 to 1790 and implemented a wide array of radical reforms, such as the complete abolition of [[serfdom]], the imposition of equal taxation policies between the [[aristocracy]] and the [[peasant]]ry, the institution of [[religious toleration]], including equal [[civil rights]] for Jews and the suppression of Catholic religious authority throughout his empire, creating a more [[Secularism|secular]] nation.&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the Enlightenment, a rising tide of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] in Western Europe during the 18th century also contributed to the growth of liberal society by spurring commercial and entrepreneurial activity.

In the early 18th century, the [[Commonwealth men]] and the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] in England, promoted [[republicanism]] and condemned the perceived widespread [[Political corruption|corruption]] and lack of morality during the [[Robert Walpole|Walpole era]], theorizing that only [[civic virtue]] could protect a country from despotism and ruin. A series of essays, known as [[Cato's Letters]], published in the ''[[London Journal]]'' during the 1720s and written by [[John Trenchard (writer)|John Trenchard]] and [[Thomas Gordon (writer)|Thomas Gordon]], condemned [[tyranny]] and advanced principles of [[freedom of conscience]] and [[freedom of speech]]. They were an important influence on the development of [[Republicanism in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Robbins, ''The Eighteenth-Century Commonwealthman: Studies in the Transmission, Development, and Circumstance of English Liberal Thought from the Restoration of Charles II until the War with the Thirteen Colonies'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1760s, the "[[Middlesex]] radicals", led by the politician [[John Wilkes]] who was expelled from the House of Commons for [[seditious libel]], founded the Society for the Defence of the Bill of Rights and developed the belief that every man had the right to vote and "natural reason" enabled him to properly judge political issues. Liberty consisted in frequent elections. This was to begin a long tradition of British [[radicalism (historical)|radicalism]].

=== French Enlightenment ===
[[File:Montesquieu 1.png|thumb|upright|[[Montesquieu]] was a prominent figure of the [[French Enlightenment]] who argued for the [[Separation of powers|separation of the powers of government]] in his  ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748)]]
In contrast to England, the French experience in the 18th century was characterized by the perpetuation of [[feudalism]] and [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. Ideas that challenged the status quo were often harshly repressed. Most of the [[philosophe]]s of the [[French Enlightenment]] were progressive in the liberal sense and advocated the reform of the French system of government along more constitutional and liberal lines.

[[Montesquieu]] wrote a series of highly influential works in the early 18th century, including ''[[Lettres persanes|Persian letters]]'' (1717) and ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748). The latter exerted tremendous influence, both inside and outside France. Montesquieu pleaded in favor of [[Constitution|a constitutional system of government]], the preservation of civil liberties and the law and the idea that political institutions ought to reflect the social and geographical aspects of each community. In particular, he argued that political liberty required [[separation of powers|the separation of the powers of government]]. Building on [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise of Government]]'', he advocated that the executive, legislative and judicial functions of government should be assigned to different bodies, so that attempts by one branch of government to infringe on political liberty might be restrained by the other branches. In a lengthy discussion of the English political system, which he greatly admired, he tried to show how this might be achieved and liberty secured, even in a monarchy. He also notes that liberty cannot be secure where there is no separation of powers, even in a republic. He also emphasized the importance of a robust due process in law, including the [[right to a fair trial]], the [[presumption of innocence]] and [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality in the severity of punishment]].

Another important figure of the French Enlightenment was [[Voltaire]]. Initially believing in the constructive role an enlightened monarch could play in improving the welfare of the people, he eventually came to a new conclusion: "It is up to us to cultivate our garden". His most polemical and ferocious attacks on intolerance and religious persecutions indeed began to appear a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/homes/VSA/Candide/Candide.letter.html |title=Letter on the subject of Candide, to the Journal encyclopédique July&amp;nbsp;15, 1759|accessdate=7 January 2008|publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061013194545/http://humanities.uchicago.edu/homes/VSA/Candide/Candide.letter.html |archivedate = 13 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite much persecution, Voltaire remained a courageous polemicist who indefatigably fought for [[civil rights]]—the [[right to a fair trial]] and [[freedom of religion]]—and who denounced the hypocrisies and injustices of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''.

== Era of revolution ==
=== American revolution ===
{{main article|American Revolution}}
[[File:Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States.jpg|thumb|The [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787 adopted the [[United States Constitution]] (still in effect), which established a [[Federalism|federalist]] [[republic]] with three equal branches of government]]
Political tension between England and its [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] grew after 1765 and the [[Seven Years' War]] over the issue of [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]], culminating in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of a new republic, and the resulting [[American Revolutionary War]] to defend it.

The intellectual underpinnings for independence were provided by the English pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]]. His ''[[Common Sense]]'' pro-independence pamphlet was anonymously published on January 10, 1776 and became an immediate success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trussel.com/hf/rights.htm "Introduction to ''Rights of Man''"], Howard Fast, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; It was read aloud everywhere, including the Army.&lt;ref name=Hitchens&gt;{{cite book|author=Hitchens, Christopher|title=Thomas Paine's Rights of Man|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8021-4383-9|publisher=Grove Press|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hitchens /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://find.galegroup.com/gvrl/infomark.do?&amp;contentSet=EBKS&amp;type=retrieve&amp;tabID=T001&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;docId=CX3454901190&amp;source=gale&amp;userGroupName=rich30969&amp;version=1.0 |accessdate=April 10, 2007 |last=Oliphant |first=John |title=Encyclopedia of the American Revolution: Library of Military History |chapter=Paine,Thomas |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |via=Gale Virtual Library |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pioneered a style of political writing that rendered complex ideas easily intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Jensen, ''The Founding of a Nation: A History of the American Revolution, 1763–1776'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1968), p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], written in committee largely by [[Thomas Jefferson]], echoed [[John Locke|Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the leaders debated about how to move forward. The [[Articles of Confederation]], written in 1776, now appeared inadequate to provide security, or even a functional government. The [[United States in Congress Assembled|Confederation Congress]] called a [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, which resulted in the writing of a new [[Constitution of the United States]] establishing a [[Federation|federal]] government. In the context of the times, the Constitution was a republican and liberal document.&lt;ref name="Roberts, p. 701"&gt;Roberts, p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Milan Zafirovski|title=Liberal Modernity and Its Adversaries: Freedom, Liberalism and Anti-Liberalism in the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNlT9Qho0tAC|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|pages=237–38|isbn=978-90-04-16052-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the oldest liberal governing document in effect worldwide.

The [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American theorists and politicians]] strongly believe in the sovereignty of the people rather than in the sovereignty of the King.

The American Revolution had its impact on the French Revolution and later movements in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spielvogel|first=Jackson|title=Western Civilization: Since 1300|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYeUtjFBaggC&amp;pg=PT311|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=578|isbn=978-1111342197}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leopold von Ranke]], a leading German historian, in 1848 argued that American republicanism played a crucial role in the development of European liberalism:
:By abandoning English constitutionalism and creating a new republic based on the rights of the individual, the North Americans introduced a new force in the world. Ideas spread most rapidly when they have found adequate concrete expression. Thus republicanism entered our Romanic/Germanic world.... Up to this point, the conviction had prevailed in Europe that monarchy best served the interests of the nation. Now the idea spread that the nation should govern itself. But only after a state had actually been formed on the basis of the theory of representation did the full significance of this idea become clear. All later revolutionary movements have this same goal.... This was the complete reversal of a principle. Until then, a king who ruled by the grace of God had been the center around which everything turned. Now the idea emerged that power should come from below.... These two principles are like two opposite poles, and it is the conflict between them that determines the course of the modern world. In Europe the conflict between them had not yet taken on concrete form; with the French Revolution it did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Willi Paul|title=The First American Constitutions: Republican Ideology and the Making of the State Constitutions in the Revolutionary Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTSMmWQSR7UC&amp;pg=PA128|year=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=128–29|isbn=9780742520691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French Revolution ===
{{main article|Influence of the French Revolution}}
[[File:Women's March on Versailles01.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[The Women's March on Versailles|march of the women]] on [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in October 1789, one of the most famous examples of popular political participation during the French Revolution, forced the royal court back to Paris—it would remain there until the proclamation of the [[First French Republic|First Republic]] in 1792]]
Historians widely regard the French Revolution as one of the most important events in history.&lt;ref name="Frey, Foreword"&gt;Frey, Foreword.&lt;/ref&gt; The Revolution is often seen as marking the "dawn of the modern era",&lt;ref name="Frey, Preface"&gt;Frey, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; and its convulsions are widely associated with "the triumph of liberalism".&lt;ref name="Ros, p. 11"&gt;Ros, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years into the French Revolution, German writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Johann von Goethe]] reportedly told the defeated Prussian soldiers after the [[Battle of Valmy]] that "from this place and from this time forth commences a new era in world history, and you can all say that you were present at its birth".&lt;ref&gt;Coker, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the participatory politics of the French Revolution, one historian commented that "thousands of men and even many women gained firsthand experience in the political arena: they talked, read, and listened in new ways; they voted; they joined new organizations; and they marched for their political goals. Revolution became a tradition, and [[republicanism]] an enduring option".&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; For liberals, the Revolution was their defining moment, and later liberals approved of the French Revolution almost entirely—"not only its results but the act itself," as two historians noted.&lt;ref&gt;Manent and Seigel, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Revolution began in 1789 with the convocation of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] in May. The first year of the Revolution witnessed members of the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]] proclaiming the [[Tennis Court Oath]] in June, the [[Storming of the Bastille]] in July. The two key events that marked the triumph of liberalism were the [[Abolition of feudalism in France]] on the night of 4 August 1789, which marked the collapse of feudal and old traditional rights and privileges and restrictions, and the passage of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in August. Jefferson, the American ambassador to France, was consulted in its drafting and there are striking similarities with the American ''Declaration of Independence.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon Meacham|title=Thomas Jefferson: President and Philosopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tvBMBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131|year=2014|publisher=Random House|page=131|isbn=9780385387514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next few years were dominated by tensions between various [[The Legislative Assembly and the fall of the French monarchy|liberal assemblies]] and a [[conservatism|conservative]] monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms. A [[First French Republic|republic]] was proclaimed in September 1792 and [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] was executed the following year. However, conflict between rival political factions, the [[Girondist|Girondins]] and the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]], culminated in the [[Reign of Terror]], that was marked by mass executions of "enemies of the revolution", with the death toll reaching into the tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;David Andress, ''The terror: Civil war in the French revolution'' 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Finally [[Napoleon]] came to power in 1799, ended any form of democracy with his dictatorship, ended internal civil wars, made peace with the Catholic Church, and conquered much of Europe until he went too far and was finally defeated in 1815. The rise of [[Napoleon]] as dictator in 1799, heralded a reverse of many of the republican and democratic gains. However Napoleon did not restore the ancien regime. He kept much of the liberalism and imposed a liberal code of law, the [[Code Napoleon]].

[[File:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|left|First page of [[Napoleon]]'s [[Napoleonic code|Civil Code]] which removed inherited privilege and allowed freedom of religion]]
During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the French brought to Western Europe the liquidation of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], the liberalization of [[property law]]s, the end of [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], the abolition of [[guild]]s, the legalization of [[divorce]], the disintegration of [[Ghetto|Jewish ghettos]], the collapse of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], the final end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the elimination of church courts and religious authority, the establishment of the [[metric system]], and [[Equality before the law|equality under the law]] for all men.&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, pp. 428–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon wrote that "the peoples of Germany, as of France, Italy and Spain, want equality and liberal ideas,"&lt;ref name="Colton and Palmer, p. 428"&gt;Colton and Palmer, p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; with some historians suggesting that he may have been the first person ever to use the word "liberal" in a political sense.&lt;ref name="Colton and Palmer, p. 428"/&gt; He also governed through a method that one historian described as "civilian dictatorship", which "drew its legitimacy from direct consultation with the people, in the form of a plebiscite".&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon, however, did not always live up to the liberal ideals he espoused.

Outside France the Revolution had a major impact and its ideas became widespread. Furthermore, the French armies in the 1790s and 1800s directly overthrew feudal remains in much of western Europe. They liberalised [[property law]]s, ended [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], abolished the [[guild]] of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised [[divorce]], and closed the [[Ghetto|Jewish ghettos]]. The [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] ended as did the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced, and [[Equality before the law|equality under the law]] was proclaimed for all men.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer and Colton, (1995) pp. 428–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artz emphasises the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution:
:For nearly two decades the Italians had the excellent codes of law, a fair system of taxation, a better economic situation, and more religious and intellectual toleration than they had known for centuries&amp;nbsp;... Everywhere old physical, economic, and intellectual barriers had been thrown down and the Italians had begun to be aware of a common nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick B. Artz, ''Reaction and Revolution: 1814–1832'' (1934) pp. 142–43&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise in [[History of Switzerland|Switzerland]] the long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed by Martin:
:It proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorised mixed marriages (between Catholics and Protestants), suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works.&lt;ref&gt;William Martin, ''Histoire de la Suisse'' (Paris, 1926), pp. 187–88, quoted in Crane Brinson, ''A Decade of Revolution: 1789–1799'' (1934) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

His most lasting achievement, the [[Napoleonic code|Civil Code]], served as "an object of emulation all over the globe,"&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; but it also perpetuated further discrimination against women under the banner of the "natural order".&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, pp. 98–102.&lt;/ref&gt; This unprecedented period of chaos and revolution had irreversibly introduced the world to a new movement and ideology that would soon criss-cross the globe. For France, however, the defeat of [[Napoleon]] brought about the [[Bourbon restoration|restoration of the monarchy]] and an ultra-conservative order was reimposed on the country.

== Classical liberalism ==
{{main article|Classical liberalism}}
The development into maturity of [[classical liberalism]] took place before and after the [[French Revolution]] in Britain, and was based on the following core concepts: [[classical economics]], [[free trade]], [[laissez-faire]] government with minimal intervention and taxation and a [[balanced budget]]. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radicalism ===
{{main article|Radicalism (historical)|l1=Radicalism}}
[[File:PaineRightsOfMan.png|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[The Rights of Man]]'' was a manifesto for [[political radicalism]]]]
The [[Radicalism (historical)|radical liberal movement]] began in the 1790s in England and concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasizing [[natural rights]] and popular sovereignty. Radicals like [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[The Rights of Man]]'' (1791) provoked a response from [[Edmund Burke|Burke]], with his [[conservative]] essay ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''. The ensuing [[Revolution Controversy]] featured, among others, [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], who followed with an early [[feminism|feminist]] tract ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''. Radicals encouraged mass support for democratic reform along with rejection of the [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]], and all forms of privilege. Different strands of the movement developed, with middle class "reformers" aiming to widen the franchise to represent commercial and industrial interests and towns without parliamentary representation, while "Popular radicals" drawn from the middle class and from [[artisan]]s agitated to assert wider rights including relieving distress. The theoretical basis for electoral reform was provided by "Philosophical radicals" who followed the [[utilitarian]] philosophy of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and strongly supported parliamentary reform, but were generally hostile to the arguments and tactics of the "popular radicals".

Improved economic conditions after 1821, improvements in economic and criminal law and the abandoning of policies of repression led to decreasing polarisation and a more consensual form of reform politics that was to dominate in Britain for the next two centuries. In 1823 [[Jeremy Bentham]] co-founded the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' with [[James Mill]] as a journal for "philosophical radicals", setting out the [[utilitarian]] philosophy.

The [[Reform Act 1832]] was put through with the support of public outcry, mass meetings of "political unions" and riots in some cities. This now enfranchised the middle classes, but failed to meet radical demands. Following the Reform Act the mainly aristocratic Whigs in the House of Commons were joined by a small number of [[Radicals (UK)|parliamentary Radicals]], as well as an increased number of middle class Whigs. By 1839 they were informally being called "the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal party]]. The Liberals produced one of the greatest British prime ministers—[[William Gladstone]], who was also known as the ''Grand Old Man'' and was the towering political figure of liberalism in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Gladstone, the Liberals reformed education, [[Irish Church Disestablishment Act 1869|disestablished]] the [[Church of Ireland]], and introduced the secret ballot for local and parliamentary elections.

==== ''Laissez-faire'' ====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s philosophy counseled government to adopt policies that could bestow the greatest possible social benefit]]
Commitment to ''[[laissez-faire]]'' was not uniform. Some economists advocated state support of public works and education. Classical liberals were also divided on [[free trade]]. [[David Ricardo]] expressed doubt that the removal of grain tariffs would have any general benefits. Most classical liberals also supported legislation to regulate the number of hours that children were allowed to work and usually did not oppose factory reform legislation.&lt;ref name="Richardson, p. 33"&gt;Richardson, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the pragmatism of classical economists, their views were expressed in dogmatic terms by such popular writers as [[Jane Marcet]] and [[Harriet Martineau]].&lt;ref name="Richardson, p. 33"/&gt; The strongest defender of ''laissez-faire'' was ''[[The Economist]]'' founded by [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]] in 1843. ''The Economist'' criticised Ricardo for his lack of support for free trade and expressed hostility to welfare, believing that the lower orders were responsible for their economic circumstances. ''The Economist'' took the position that regulation of factory hours was harmful to workers and also strongly opposed state support for education, health, the provision of water, and granting of patents and copyrights.

=== Liberal economic theory ===
{{main|Economic liberalism}}
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adam Smith]] argued for free trade and low levels of government regulation]]
The primary intellectual influences on 19th century liberal trends were those of [[Adam Smith]] and the classical economists, and [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics, at least until the publication of [[J. S. Mill]]'s ''Principles'' in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, pp. 63, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth, and the policies the state should follow in order to maximise wealth.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 64"&gt;Mills, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's economics was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]], that had restricted the mobility of labour, in 1834, and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 69"&gt;Mills, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Adam Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], Malthus theories of population and Ricardo's [[iron law of wages]] became central doctrines of classical economics.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 76"&gt;Mills, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Baptiste Say]] challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. [[Thomas Malthus]] wrote ''[[An essay on the principle of population]]'' in 1798,&lt;ref&gt;Mills, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; becoming a major influence on classical liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Utilitarianism]] provided the political justification for the implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments, which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s later writings on the subject foreshadowed the welfare state, it was mainly used as a justification for [[laissez-faire]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that public policy should seek to provide "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to reduce poverty, it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.&lt;ref name="Mills, p. 76"/&gt; His philosophy proved to be extremely influential on government policy and led to increased Benthamite attempts at government social control, including [[Robert Peel]]'s [[Metropolitan Police]], [[prison reform]]s, the [[workhouse]]s and [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] for the mentally ill.

[[File:PSM V03 D380 John Stuart Mill.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'' greatly influenced the course of 19th century liberalism]]
By the end of the nineteenth century, the principles of [[classical liberalism]] were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of [[organized labour]]. The ideal of the self-made individual, who through hard work and talent could make his or her place in the world, seemed increasingly implausible. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by [[industrialisation]]  and ''laissez-faire'' capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although [[socialism]] later became a more important force for change and reform. Some Victorian writers—including [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], and [[Matthew Arnold]]—became early influential critics of social injustice.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; The New Liberalism or [[social liberalism]] movement emerged about 1900 in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Freeden]], ''The New Liberalism: An Ideology of Social Reform'' (Oxford UP, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Stuart Mill and liberal political theory ===
[[John Stuart Mill]] contributed enormously to liberal thought by combining elements of classical liberalism with what eventually became known as the new liberalism. Mill's 1859 ''[[On Liberty]]'' addressed the nature and limits of the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] that can be legitimately exercised by society over the [[individual]].&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart "On Liberty" Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; He gives an impassioned defence of free speech, arguing that free [[discourse]] is a [[necessary condition]] for intellectual and social progress. Mill defined "[[social liberty]]" as protection from "the tyranny of political rulers." He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny, and [[tyranny of the majority]] respectively. [[Social liberty]] meant limits on the ruler's power through obtaining recognition of political liberties or rights and by the establishment of a system of "[[constitutional]] checks".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart "On Liberty" Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomashillgreen.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Liberal philosopher [[Thomas Hill Green]] began to espouse a more interventionist government approach]]
Green's definition of [[liberty]], influenced by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Josiah Warren]], was that the [[individual]] ought to be free to do as he wishes unless he harms others.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill (1806–1873), "The Contest in America."  Harper's New Monthly Magazine, Volume 24, Issue 143, pp. 683–84. Harper &amp; Bros., New York, April 1862.

In his article, "[[The Subjection of Women]]" (1861, published 1869), Mill attempted to prove that the legal subjugation of women is wrong and that it should give way to perfect equality.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill: critical assessments, Volume 4, By [[John Cunningham Wood]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S.

However, although Mill' initial [[Philosophy and economics|economic philosophy]] supported [[free market]]s and argued that [[progressive tax]]ation penalised those who worked harder,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irefeurope.org/col_docs/doc_51_fr.pdf "Pour la liberte economique et la concurrence fiscale"] (PDF). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327011315/http://www.irefeurope.org/col_docs/doc_51_fr.pdf |date=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he later altered his views toward a more [[Social liberalism|socialist bent]], adding chapters to his Principles of Political Economy in defence of a socialist outlook, and defending some socialist causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mill, John Stuart and Bentham, Jeremy edited by Ryan, Alan.|title=Utilitarianism and other essays|edition=|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2004|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-043272-5|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system.

The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] led in Parliament by [[W. E. Gladstone]] drew from across the intellectual and social spectrum.  On one hand, there were progressive elites who sought to fuse the methods of science with liberal political economy.  The anthropologist and MP [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|Sir John Lubbock]], for example, followed the strategy of using cognitive science to challenge and shape public policy.  He famously applied this approach to parliamentary debates relating to universal education, the preservation of monuments and the introduction of Bank Holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Politics of Cognition: Liberalism and the Evolutionary Origins of Victorian Education|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|date=2017|volume=50|issue=4|pages=677–699|doi=10.1017/S0007087417000863 |pmid=29019300|url=https://www.academia.edu/31947844}}&lt;/ref&gt; One the other hand, the liberal party also had a strong base in evangelical and nonconformist religious elements [[Thomas Hill Green]] (1836-1882) at  Balliol College, Oxford, for instance, argued that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual. Green regarded the national state as legitimate only to the extent that it upholds a system of rights and obligations that is most likely to foster individual self-realisation.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, P. P., “T. H. Green and State Action: Liquor Legislation’, ''History of Political Thought,'' 6 (1985), 517–50.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gladstonian liberals in 1891 adopted "[[the Newcastle Programme]] that included home rule for Ireland,  disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales and Scotland, tighter controls on the sale of liquor,  major extension of factory regulation, and various democratic political reforms. The Programme had a strong appeal to the Nonconformist middle-class Liberal element, which felt liberated by the departure of the aristocratic leaders of the Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Cook|title=A Short History of the Liberal Party: The Road Back to Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1p9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|pages=24–26|isbn=9781137056078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Worldwide spread ==
{{main article|Liberalism by country}}
[[Abolitionism|Abolitionist]] and [[suffrage]] movements spread, along with representative and democratic ideals. France established an [[French Third Republic|enduring republic]] in the 1870s. Meanwhile, nationalism also spread rapidly after 1815. A mixture of liberal and nationalist sentiment in Italy and Germany brought about the unification of the two countries in the late 19th century. A liberal regime came to power in Italy, and ended the secular power of the popes. The Vatican, however, launched a counter crusade against liberalism. [[Pope Pius IX]] issued the [[Syllabus of Errors]] in 1864, condemning liberalism in all its forms. In many countries, liberal forces responded by expelling the Jesuit order.

Liberalism gained momentum in the beginning of the 20th century. The bastion of [[autocracy]], the [[Nicholas II|Russian Tsar]], was overthrown in the [[February Revolution|first phase]] of the [[Russian Revolution]]. The Allied victory in [[World War I]] and the collapse of four empires seemed to mark the triumph of liberalism across the European continent, not just among the [[Allies of World War I|victorious allies]], but also in Germany and the newly created states of [[Eastern Europe]]. Militarism, as typified by Germany, was defeated and discredited. As Blinkhorn argues, the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of "cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free-market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the [[League of Nations]]".

The worldwide [[Great Depression]], starting in 1929, hastened the discrediting of liberal economics and strengthened calls for state control over economic affairs. Economic woes prompted widespread unrest in the European political world, leading to the strengthening of [[fascism]] and communism. Their rise in 1939 culminated in [[World War II]]. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], which included most of the important liberal nations as well as communist Russia, won World War II, defeating Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and militarist Japan. After the war, there was a falling out between Russia and the West, and the [[Cold War]] opened in 1947 between the Communist [[Eastern Bloc]] and the liberal [[Western Bloc|Western Alliance]].

[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|200px|[[John Maynard Keynes]] was one of the most influential economists of modern times whose ideas, which are still [[2008–09 Keynesian resurgence|widely felt]], formalized modern [[liberal economic]] policy]]
Meanwhile, the definitive liberal response to the Great Depression was given by the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pressman|first=Steven|title=Fifty Great Economists|year=1999|isbn=978-0-415-13481-1|pages=96–100|publisher=London: routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keynes was deeply critical of the British government's austerity measures during the Great Depression. He believed that budget deficits were a good thing, a product of recessions. He wrote, "For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as to present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill."&lt;ref name="Cassidy2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=John|title=The Demand Doctor|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the [[Great Depression]] in 1933, Keynes published ''The Means to Prosperity'', which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter cyclical public spending. ''The Means to Prosperity'' contains one of the first mentions of the [[multiplier effect]].&lt;ref name = "Skid30s" &gt;{{cite book|last=Skidelsky|first=Robert|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883–1946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman|year=2003|isbn=978-0-330-488679|pages= 494–500, 504, 509–10|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keynes's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' was published in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Keith Tribe, ''Economic careers: economics and economists in Britain, 1930–1970'' (1997), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a theoretical justification for the interventionist policies Keynes favoured for tackling a recession.

The Cold War featured extensive ideological competition and several [[proxy war]]s, but the widely feared [[World War III|Third World War]] between the Soviet Union and the United States never occurred. While communist states and liberal democracies competed against one another, an [[1973 oil crisis|economic crisis]] in the 1970s inspired a move away from [[Keynesian economics]], especially under [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the UK and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the US. This classical liberal renewal, called pejoratively "[[neoliberalism]]" by its opponents, lasted through the 1980s and the 1990s. Meanwhile, nearing the end of the 20th century, communist states in [[Eastern Europe]] [[Revolutions of 1989|collapsed precipitously]], leaving liberal democracies as the only major forms of government in the West.

This classical liberal renewal, sometimes called [[libertarianism]],&lt;ref name="Ronald Reagan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/libertarianism%7Cquote=|title=Libertarianism Quote Quotes (0 quotes)|website=goodreads.com|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; lasted through the 1980s and the 1990s, although [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|recent economic troubles]] have prompted a [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence|resurgence in Keynesian economic thought]]. Meanwhile, nearing the end of the 20th century, communist states in [[Eastern Europe]] [[Revolutions of 1989|collapsed precipitously]], leaving liberal democracies as the only major forms of government in the West.

At the beginning of World War II, the number of democracies around the world was about the same as it had been forty years before.&lt;ref&gt;Colomer, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1945, liberal democracies spread very quickly, but then retreated. In ''The Spirit of Democracy'', Larry Diamond argues that by 1974, "dictatorship, not democracy, was the way of the world", and that "Barely a quarter of independent states chose their governments through competitive, free, and fair elections." Diamond goes on to say that democracy bounced back and by 1995 the world was "predominantly democratic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Larry Diamond|title=The Spirit of Democracy: The Struggle to Build Free Societies Throughout the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vx3JTGSB5JcC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2008|publisher=Henry Holt|page=7|isbn=978-0-8050-7869-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom in the World 2016 |publisher=Freedom House |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2016?gclid=COLduYD4ys4CFVUvgQodDPkNvw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gains of liberalism have been significant. In 1975, roughly 40 countries around the world were characterised as liberal democracies, but that number had increased to more than 80 as of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Farr, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|world's richest]] and [[Great power|most powerful]] nations are liberal democracies with extensive [[welfare state|social welfare programmes]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierson, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; However, liberalism still faces challenges, especially with the phenomenal growth of China as a model combination of authoritarian government and economic liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Peerenboom, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Recession]], which began around 2007, prompted a [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence|resurgence in Keynesian economic thought]].

A major liberal accomplishment includes the rise of [[liberal internationalism]], which has been credited with the establishment of global organisations such as the [[League of Nations]] and, after World War II, the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of exporting liberalism worldwide and constructing a harmonious and liberal internationalist order has dominated the thinking of liberals since the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Schell, p. 266"&gt;Schell, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; "Wherever liberalism has flourished domestically, it has been accompanied by visions of liberal internationalism," one historian wrote.&lt;ref name="Schell, p. 266"/&gt; But resistance to liberal internationalism was deep and bitter, with critics arguing that growing global interdependency would result in the loss of national sovereignty and that democracies represented a corrupt order incapable of either domestic or global governance.&lt;ref&gt;Schell, pp. 273–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism is frequently cited as the dominant [[ideology]] of modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, liberals have organised extensively throughout the world. [[Liberal Party|Liberal parties]], [[Liberal International#Liberal think tanks and foundations|think tanks]], and other institutions are common in many nations, although they advocate for different causes based on their ideological orientation. Liberal parties can be [[centre-left]], [[Centrism|centrist]], or [[centre-right]] depending on their location.

{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|Liberals are committed to build and safeguard free, fair and open societies, in which they seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty, equality and community, and in which no one is enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity [...] Liberalism aims to disperse power, to foster diversity and to nurture creativity.|[[Liberal International]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberal-international.org/editorial.asp?ia_id=508 "The International"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060610034316/http://liberal-international.org/editorial.asp?ia_id=508|date=10 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
They can further be divided based on their adherence to [[social liberalism]] or [[classical liberalism]], although all liberal parties and individuals share basic similarities, including the support for [[civil rights]] and [[Democracy|democratic institutions]]. On a global level, liberals are united in the [[Liberal International]], which contains over 100 influential liberal parties and organisations from across the [[Political spectrum|ideological spectrum]].

Some parties in the LI are among the most famous in the world, such as the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], while others are among the smallest, such as the [[Gibraltar Liberal Party]]. Regionally, liberals are organised through various institutions depending on the prevailing geopolitical context. The [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]], for example, represents the interests of liberals in Europe while the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] is the predominant liberal group in the [[European Parliament]].

=== Freemasons ===
In long-term historical perspective, [[Norman Davies]] has argued that Freemasonry was a powerful force on behalf of Liberalism in Europe and its colonies, from about 1700 to the twentieth century.  It expanded rapidly during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], reaching  practically every country in Europe, as well as the British and Spanish overseas colonies.  It was especially attractive to royalty, powerful aristocrats and politicians as well as intellectuals, artists and political activists.  Its great enemy was the Roman Catholic Church, so that in countries with a large Catholic element, such as France, Italy, Austria, Spain, and Mexico, much of the ferocity of the political battles involve the confrontation between the conservatives centered around the Church and liberals who were often Freemasons.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Weisberger et al., eds., ''Freemasonry on both sides of the Atlantic: essays concerning the craft in the British Isles, Europe, the United States, and Mexico'' (East European Monographs, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret C. Jacob, ''Living the Enlightenment: Freemasonry and politics in eighteenth-century Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1820s, every regiment of the British Army had at least one Masonic chapter, and they set about to form chapters among civilians everywhere they were stationed in the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jessica Harland-Jacobs|title=Builders of Empire: Freemasons and British Imperialism, 1717–1927|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2bQ5KrN3cUC&amp;pg=PT15|year=2007|publisher=U North Carolina Press|pages=15–16|isbn=9781469606651}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the French, Spanish, and Portuguese empires, Army chapters were also active in spreading Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.P.

[[File:Tahtawi.jpg|thumb|[[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]] (1801–1873)]]
In the Middle East and the Ottoman Empire the effect of liberalism was significant. During the 19th century, Arab, Ottoman, and Persian intellectuals visited Europe to study and learn about Western literature, science and liberal ideas. This led them to ask themselves about their countries' underdevelopment and concluded that they needed to promote constitutionalism, development, and liberal values to modernize their societies.&lt;ref name="LindgrenRoss"/&gt; At the same time, the increasing European presence in the Middle East and the stagnation of the region encouraged some Middle Eastern leaders, including [[Mahmud II]] and his son [[Abdülmecid I]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], and [[Amir Kabir]], to make socio-political changes and start modernization projects.&lt;ref name="LindgrenRoss"/&gt; In 1826, intellectual and academic [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]] was sent to Paris in one of the Muhammad Ali's scholar missions. Tahtawi studied ethics, social and political philosophy, and mathematics. He read works by [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] and [[Étienne Bézout|Bézout]], among others, during his séjour in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vatikiotis|first=P. J.|title=The Modern History of Egypt|year=1976|isbn=978-0297772620|edition=Repr.|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831, Tahtawi returned home to be part of the statewide effort to modernize the Egyptian infrastructure and education in what became an Egyptian renaissance (''[[Nahda]]'') that flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, later moving to Ottoman-ruled Arabic-speaking regions including Lebanon, Syria and others. He founded the School of Languages (also known as School of Translators) in 1835, which become part of [[Ain Shams University]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vatikiotis|first=P.

Three of his published volumes were works of political and [[moral philosophy]]. They introduced his Egyptian audience to the liberal ideas of the Enlightenment such as secular authority and political rights and liberty, his ideas regarding how a modern civilized society ought to be and what constituted by extension a civilized or "good Egyptian", and his ideas on public interest and public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vatikiotis|first=P.

In the Ottoman Empire, to secure its territorial integrity against internal nationalist movements and external aggressive powers, the Empire launched a series of reforms. This period is called [[Tanzimat]] (reorganization). Although liberal ministers and intellectuals tried to influence the reforms, the motives for the implementation of Tanzimât were bureaucratic.&lt;ref name="LindgrenRoss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindgren|first1=Allana|last2=Ross|first2=Stephen|title=The Modernist World|date=2015|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1317696162|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFvLCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA440|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yapp|first1=Malcolm|authorlink1=Malcolm Yapp|title=The Making of the Modern Near East 1792–1923|date=9 January 2014|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1317871071|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1IkcBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes were made to improve civil liberties. However, the reformist ideas and trends of the Nahda and Tanzimat didn't reach the common population successfully, as the books, periodicals, and newspapers were accessible primarily to intellectuals and segments of an emerging middle class, while many Muslims saw them as foreign influences on the world of Islam. That perception complicated reformist efforts made by Middle Eastern states.&lt;ref name="Abdelmoula"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roderic. H.

The Nahda period sought to modernize Islam and society.

In Egypt, the [[Wafd Party]] ("Delegation Party") was a nationalist liberal political party in Egypt.

In the middle of the 20th century, the [[South African Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] and the [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]] were formed to oppose the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] policies of the government.

In recent times, the party has adopted more of a liberal streak, championing open markets while simultaneously seeking social justice.

Recently, liberal parties and institutions have made a major push for political power. On a continental level, liberals are organised in the [[Africa Liberal Network]], which contains influential parties such as the [[Popular Movement (Morocco)|Popular Movement]] in Morocco, the [[Senegalese Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in Senegal, and the [[Rally of the Republicans]] in Côte d'Ivoire. In Asia, several Asian nations have explicitly rejected important liberal principles. Continentally, liberals are organized through the [[Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats]], which includes powerful parties such the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] in the Philippines, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in Taiwan, and the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] in Thailand. A notable example of liberal influence can be found in India. In [[Liberalism in India|India]], the most populous democracy in the world, the [[Indian National Congress]] has long dominated political affairs.

In [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|Latin America]], liberal unrest dates back to the 18th century, when liberal agitation in Latin America led to [[Latin American wars of independence|independence]] from the imperial power of Spain and Portugal. The new regimes were generally liberal in their political outlook, and employed the philosophy of [[positivism]], which emphasized the truth of modern science, to buttress their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Ardao, "Assimilation and transformation of positivism in Latin America." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1963): 515–522.

[[File:Benito Pablo Juárez García.png|thumb|172px|[[Benito Juárez]], [[List of heads of state of Mexico|26th]] [[President of Mexico]]]]
The liberal and conservative struggles in Spain also replicated themselves in [[Latin America]]. Like its former master, the region was a hotbed of wars, conflicts, and revolutionary activity throughout the 19th century. In Mexico, the ''liberales'' instituted the program of ''La Reforma'' in the 1850s, reducing the power of the military and the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Stacy, p. 698"&gt;Stacy, p. 698.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''conservadores'' were outraged at these steps and launched a revolt, which sparked a deadly conflict. From 1857 to 1861, Mexico was gripped in the bloody [[Reform War|War of Reform]], a massive internal and ideological confrontation between the liberals and the conservatives.&lt;ref name="Stacy, p. 698"/&gt; The liberals eventually triumphed and [[Benito Juárez]], a dedicated liberal and now a Mexican national hero, became the president of the republic. After Juárez, Mexico suffered from prolonged periods of dictatorial repression, which lasted until the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the early 20th century.

Another regional example of liberal influence can be found in Ecuador. As with other nations throughout the region at the time, Ecuador was steeped in conflict and uncertainty after gaining independence from Spain. By the middle of the 19th century, the country had descended into chaos and madness, with the people divided between rival liberal and conservative camps. From these conflicts, [[Gabriel García Moreno|García Moreno]] established a conservative government that ruled the country for several years. The liberals, however, were incensed at the conservative regime and overthrew it completely in the [[Liberal Revolution of 1895]]. The [[Ecuadorian Radical Liberal Party|Radical Liberals]] who toppled the conservatives were led by [[Eloy Alfaro]], a firebrand who implemented a variety of sociopolitical reforms, including the separation of church and state, the legalization of divorce, and the establishment of public schools.&lt;ref&gt;Handelsman, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal revolutions in countries such as [[Mexican Revolution|Mexico]] and [[Liberal Revolution of 1895|Ecuador]] ushered in the modern world for much of Latin America. Latin American liberals generally emphasised [[free trade]], [[private property]], and [[anti-clericalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dore and Molyneux, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a [[American Civil War|vicious war]] ensured the integrity of the nation and the abolition of slavery in the [[American South|south]]. Historian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory in the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65) gave a major boost to the course of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Union victory energized popular democratic forces. A Confederate victory, on the other hand, would have meant a new birth of slavery, not freedom. Historian Fergus Bordewich, following Doyle, argues that:
:The North's victory decisively proved the durability of democratic government. Confederate independence, on the other hand, would have established An American model for reactionary politics and race-based repression that would likely have cast an international shadow into the twentieth century and perhaps beyond."&lt;ref&gt;Fergus M. Bordewich, "The World Was Watching: America’s Civil War slowly came to be seen as part of a global struggle against oppressive privilege," [https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-cause-of-all-nations-by-don-h-doyle-1423260658 ''Wall Street Journal'' (Feb. 7–8, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the long-dominant Liberal Party, founded in 1867 and colloquially known as ''the Grits'', [[History of the Liberal Party of Canada|ruled the country]] for nearly 70 years during the 20th century. The party produced some of the most influential prime ministers in [[History of Canada|Canadian history]], including [[Pierre Trudeau]], [[Lester B. Pearson]] and [[Jean Chrétien]], and has been primarily responsible for the development of the Canadian [[welfare state]]. The enormous success of the Liberals – virtually unmatched in any other [[liberal democracy]] – has prompted many political commentators over time to identify them as the nation's ''natural governing party''.&lt;ref&gt;Chodos et al., p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wpa1.JPG|thumb|left|172px|Unskilled labourers working for the [[Works Progress Administration]], a [[New Deal]] agency]]
In the United States, [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]] traces its history to the popular presidency of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], who initiated the [[New Deal]] in response to the [[Great Depression]] and won an [[List of Presidents of the United States|unprecedented four elections]]. The [[New Deal coalition]] established by Franklin Roosevelt left a decisive legacy and influenced many future American presidents, including [[John F. Kennedy]], a self-described liberal who defined a liberal as "someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions&amp;nbsp;... someone who cares about the welfare of the people".&lt;ref&gt;Alterman, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The social liberal program launched by President Roosevelt in the United States, the [[New Deal]], proved very popular with the American public. In 1933, when FDR came into office, the [[Unemployment|unemployment rate]] stood at roughly 25 percent.&lt;ref name="Auerbach and Kotlikoff, p. 299"&gt;Auerbach and Kotlikoff, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the economy, measured by the [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]], had fallen to half the value it had in early 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; The electoral victories of FDR and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] precipitated a deluge of deficit spending and public works programs. In 1940, the level of unemployment had fallen by 10 points to around 15 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Steindl, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional state spending and the gigantic public works program sparked by the Second World War eventually pulled the United States out of the Great Depression. The [[New Deal|social liberal programme]] reduced the [[Unemployment|unemployment rate]] from roughly 25 percent to about 15 percent by 1940.&lt;ref name="Auerbach and Kotlikoff, p. 299"/&gt; Additional state spending and the very large public works programme sparked by the Second World War eventually pulled the United States out of the Great Depression. From 1940 to 1941, government spending increased by 59 percent, the [[Measures of national income and output|gross domestic product]] increased 17 percent, and unemployment fell below 10 percent for the first time since 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Knoop, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the various regional and national movements, the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States during the 1960s strongly highlighted the liberal efforts for [[Social equality|equal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie and Weisbrot, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Society]] project launched by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] oversaw the creation of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]], the establishment of [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] and the [[Job Corps]] as part of the [[War on Poverty]], and the passage of the landmark [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] – an altogether rapid series of events that some historians have dubbed ''the Liberal Hour''.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie and Weisbrot, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, the cause of [[Second-wave feminism|Second Wave feminism]] in the United States was advanced in large part by [[liberal feminism|liberal feminist]] organisations such as the [[National Organization for Women]].&lt;ref name="Worell470"/&gt;

In the late 20th century, a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative backlash]] against the kind of liberalism championed by Roosevelt and Kennedy developed in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name="Flamm and Steigerwald, pp. 156–8"&gt;Flamm and Steigerwald, pp. 156–58.&lt;/ref&gt; This brand of conservatism primarily reacted against the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|cultural and political upheavals]] of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Flamm and Steigerwald, pp. 156–8"/&gt; It helped launch into power such presidents as [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H. W. Bush]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Allitt, ''The Conservatives'', p. 253, Yale University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-300-16418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|Economic woes]] in the early 21st century led to a resurgence of social liberalism with the election of [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; along with countervailing and partly reactive conservative [[populism]] and [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]] embodied in the [[Tea Party movement]] and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election of Donald Trump]].

Today, [[Classical liberalism|market liberals]] in Latin America are organised in the [[Liberal Network for Latin America|Red Liberal de América Latina]] (RELIAL), a centre-right network that brings together dozens of liberal parties and organisations. RELIAL features parties as geographically diverse as the Mexican [[New Alliance Party (Mexico)|Nueva Alianza]] and the [[Cuban Liberal Union]], which aims to secure power in Cuba. Some major liberal parties in the region continue, however, to align themselves with social liberal ideas and policies – a notable case being the [[Colombian Liberal Party]], which is a member of the [[Socialist International]]. Another famous example is the Paraguayan [[Authentic Radical Liberal Party]], one of the most powerful parties in the country, which has also been classified as centre-left.&lt;ref&gt;Ameringer, p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:En Mendigorría.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|Spanish Liberals]] prepare to attack the [[Carlism|Carlists]] in the [[Battle of Mendigorría]] (1835)]]
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|200px|The iconic painting ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]], a tableau of the [[July Revolution]] in 1830]]
In Spain, the ''[[Liberalism and radicalism in Spain|Liberales]]'', the first group to use the ''liberal'' label in a political context,&lt;ref&gt;Colton and Palmer, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; fought for the implementation of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|1812 Constitution]] for decades—overthrowing the monarchy in 1820 as part of the ''[[Trienio Liberal]]'' and [[First Carlist War|defeating]] the conservative [[Carlists]] in the 1830s.

In France, the fall of Napoleon in 1814–15 brought back [[Bourbon Restoration|to power in France the reactionary Bourbon kings.]] However even they were unable to reverse the liberalization of the French Revolution and they were overthrown in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Alexander, ''Re-writing the French revolutionary tradition: Liberal opposition and the fall of the Bourbon monarchy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise The fall of Napoleon brought conservatives to power across much of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick B. Artz, ''Reaction and Revolution, 1814–1832'' (1934)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[July Revolution|July Revolution of 1830]], orchestrated by liberal politicians and journalists, removed the [[Bourbon monarchy]] and inspired similar uprisings elsewhere in Europe. Frustration with the pace of political progress in the early 19th century sparked even more gigantic [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutions in 1848]]. Revolutions spread throughout the [[Austrian Empire]], the [[German states]], and the [[List of historic states of Italy|Italian states]]. Governments fell rapidly. Liberal nationalists demanded written constitutions, representative assemblies, greater suffrage rights, and freedom of the press.&lt;ref name="Colton and Palmer, p. 510"&gt;Palmer and Colton, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[French Second Republic|second republic]] was proclaimed in France. Serfdom was abolished in [[Prussia]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Bohemia]], and Hungary. The indomitable Metternich, the Austrian builder of the reigning conservative order, shocked Europe when he resigned and fled to Britain in panic and disguise.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer and Colton, p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, however, the success of the revolutionaries petered out. Without French help, the Italians were [[First Italian War of Independence|easily defeated]] by the Austrians. With some luck and skill, Austria also managed to contain the bubbling nationalist sentiments in Germany and Hungary, helped along by the failure of the [[Frankfurt Assembly]] to unify the German states into a single nation. Two decades later, however, the Italians and the Germans realised their dreams for unification and independence. The [[Sardinia]]n Prime Minister, [[Camillo di Cavour]], was a shrewd liberal who understood that the only effective way for the Italians to gain independence was if the French were on their side.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer and Colton, pp. 546–47.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] agreed to Cavour's request for assistance and France defeated Austria in the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]] of 1859, setting the stage for Italian independence. German unification transpired under the leadership of [[Otto von Bismarck]], who decimated the enemies of Prussia in war after war, finally [[Franco-Prussian War|triumphing against France]] in 1871 and proclaiming the German Empire in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, ending another saga in the drive for nationalisation. The French proclaimed a [[French Third Republic|third republic]] after their loss in the war.

In Germany, unification brought to power the leading conservative of the nineteenth century, [[Otto von Bismarck]], a member of the landholding [[Junker]] aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Berdahl, "Conservative Politics and aristocratic landholders in Bismarckian Germany." ''Journal of Modern History'' (1972): 2–20. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1878819 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to secure the loyalty of the working classes to the ruling aristocracy, Bismarck introduced both universal male suffrage and the first welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang J. Mommsen, and Wolfgang Mock, eds. ''The emergence of the welfare state in Britain and Germany, 1850–1950'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Bismarck first formed a coalition with the liberals, with a focus on ending trade restrictions and [[Kulturkampf|reducing the power of the Catholic Church.]]  By the late 1870s he then reversed positions, and began collaborating with Catholics. He's best known for a foreign-policy that balanced multiple competing interests to produce a peaceful era.

[[File:1846 - Anti-Corn Law League Meeting.jpg|thumb|left|A meeting of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in [[Exeter Hall]] in 1846]]
In the United Kingdom, the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846 was a watershed moment and encapsulated the triumph of [[free trade]] and liberal economics. The [[Anti-Corn Law League]] brought together a coalition of liberal and radical groups in support of free trade under the leadership of [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], who opposed militarism and public expenditure. Their policies of low public expenditure and low taxation were later adopted by the liberal [[chancellor of the exchequer]] and later prime minister, [[William Ewart Gladstone]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Although classical liberals aspired to a minimum of state activity, they eventually accepted the principle of government intervention in the economy from the early 19th century with the passage of the [[Factory Acts]]. From around 1840 to 1860, [[laissez-faire]] advocates of the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]] and writers in ''[[The Economist]]'' were confident that their early victories would lead to a period of expanding economic and personal liberty and world peace but would face reversals as government intervention and activity continued to expand from the 1850s. [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[James Mill]], although advocates of laissez-faire, non-intervention in foreign affairs, and individual liberty, believed that social institutions could be rationally redesigned through the principles of [[Utilitarianism]]. By the 1870s, [[Herbert Spencer]] and other classical liberals concluded that historical development was turning against them.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; By the First World War, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] had largely abandoned classical liberal principles.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberals, under [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] and later [[Herbert Henry Asquith|H.H. Asquith]], returned with full strength in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|general election of 1906]], aided by working class voters worried about food prices. After that historic victory, the Liberal Party introduced various [[Liberal reforms|reforms]], including [[health insurance]], [[unemployment insurance]], and [[pension]]s for elderly workers, thereby laying the groundwork for the future British [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChurchillGeorge0001.jpg|thumb|Liberal politicians [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Winston Churchill]] enacted  the 1909 [[People's Budget]] which specifically aimed at the redistribution of wealth]]
The [[People's Budget]] of 1909, championed by [[David Lloyd George]] and fellow liberal [[Winston Churchill]], introduced unprecedented taxes on the wealthy in Britain and radical social welfare programmes to the country's policies.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Lee. [http://www.shepheard-walwyn.co.uk/images/inside_image/The_People_Budget.pdf The People's Budget: An Edwardian Tragedy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182535/http://www.shepheard-walwyn.co.uk/images/inside_image/The_People_Budget.pdf |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first budget with the expressed intent of redistributing wealth among the public. It imposed increased taxes on luxuries, liquor, tobacco, incomes, and land, – taxation that disproportionately affected the rich – so that money could be made available for new welfare programmes as well as new battleships. In 1911 Lloyd George succeeded in putting through Parliament his [[National Insurance Act]], making provision for sickness and invalidism, and this was followed by his [[Unemployment Insurance Act 1920|Unemployment Insurance Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Whigs, Radicals, and Liberals, 1815–1914, by Duncan Watts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, "David Lloyd George: Land, The Budget, and Social Reform," ''The American Historical Review'' Vol. 81, No. 5 (Dec., 1976), pp. 1058–66&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Peter Weiler argues the following:
:Although still partially informed by older Liberal concerns for  character, self-reliance, and the capitalist market, this legislation nevertheless, marked a significant shift in Liberal approaches to the state and social reform, approaches that later governments would slowly expand and that would grow into the welfare state after the Second World War. What was new in these reforms was the underlying assumption that the state could be a positive force, that the measure of individual freedom [...] was not how much the state left people alone, but whether he gave them the capacity to fill themselves as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Weiler, "New Liberalism" in Fred M. Leventhal, ed., ''Twentieth-century Britain: an encyclopedia'' (Garland, 1995) pp. 564–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Weiler, ''The New Liberalism: Liberal Social Theory in Great Britain, 1889–1914'' (2016) [https://www.amazon.com/New-Liberalism-1889-1914-Routledge-Nineteenth/dp/1138696528 excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, the incompetence of the ruling class in Russia discredited the monarchy and aristocracy. Russia was already reeling from [[Russo-Japanese War|earlier losses]] to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and political struggles with the [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadets]], a powerful liberal bloc in the [[Duma]]. Facing huge shortages in basic necessities along with [[February Revolution|widespread riots in early 1917]], [[Nicholas II of Russia|Czar Nicholas II]] abdicated in March, bringing to an end three centuries of [[House of Romanov|Romanov rule]] and paving the way for liberals to declare a republic. Russia's liberals, repeatedly used the slogans, symbols and ideas of the [[French Revolution]]—plastering ''[[liberté, égalité, fraternité]]'' over major public spaces—to establish an emotional attachment to the past, an attachment that liberals hoped would galvanize the public to fight for modern values.&lt;ref&gt;Shlapentokh, pp. 220–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

But democracy was no simple task, and the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] that took over the country's administration needed the cooperation of the [[Petrograd Soviet]], an organization that united leftist industrial laborers, to function and survive. Under the uncertain leadership of [[Alexander Kerensky]], however, the Provisional Government mismanaged Russia's continuing involvement in the war, prompting angry reactions from the Petrograd workers, who drifted further and further to the left. The [[Bolshevik]]s, a communist group led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], seized the political opportunity from this confusion and launched a [[October Revolution|second revolution]] in Russia during the same year. The communists violently overthrew the fragile liberal-socialist order in October, after which Russia witnessed [[Russian Civil War|several years of civil war]] between communists and conservatives wishing to restore the monarchy.

The worldwide [[Great Depression]], starting in 1929, hastened the discrediting of liberal economics and strengthened calls for state control over economic affairs. Economic woes prompted widespread unrest in the European political world, leading to the rise of [[fascism]] as an ideology and a movement arrayed against both liberalism and communism, especially in [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, pp. 218–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of fascism in the 1930s eventually culminated in the [[Second World War]], the deadliest conflict in human history. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] prevailed in the war by 1945, and their victory set the stage for the [[Cold War]] between the communist [[Eastern Bloc]] and the liberal [[Western Bloc|Western Alliance]].

In the United Kingdom, the Liberal Party lost its influence in the early 20th century due to the growth of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. In Russia, liberalism was defeated when the Communists came to power under [[Vladimir Lenin]] in October 1917, in Italy when Mussolini set up his dictatorship in 1922, in Poland in 1926 under [[Józef Piłsudski]], and in Spain in 1939 after the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Before World War I, liberal parties dominated the European political scene, but they were gradually displaced by socialists and social democrats in the early 20th century. The fortunes of liberal parties since World War II have been mixed, with some gaining strength while others suffered from continuous declines.&lt;ref&gt;Kirchner, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]] and the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] at the end of the 20th century, however, allowed the formation of many liberal parties throughout Eastern Europe. These parties developed varying ideological characters. Some, such as the Slovenian [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|Liberal Democrats]] or the Lithuanian [[New Union (Social Liberals)|Social Liberals]], have been characterised as [[centre-left]].&lt;ref&gt;Karatnycky et al., p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hafner and Ramet, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the Romanian [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]], have been classified as [[centre-right]].&lt;ref&gt;Various authors, p. 1615.&lt;!-- title? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the comprehensive [[welfare state]] was built after the [[Second World War]]. Although it was largely accomplished by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], it was also significantly designed by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who laid the economic foundations, and by [[William Beveridge]], who designed the welfare system.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|title=Political Ideology Today (Politics Today)|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=978-0719060205|year=2001|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the British Liberal Party joined with the Labour splinter [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election of 2010]], the Liberal Democrats formed a [[coalition government]] with the Conservatives, resulting in party leader [[Nick Clegg]] becoming the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime minister]] and many other members becoming ministers. However, the Liberal Democrats lost 49 of their 56 seats in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], with their review of the result concluding that a number of policy reversals were responsible for their poor electoral performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Campaigns &amp; Communications Committee|title=2015 Election Review|url=https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/libdems/pages/10848/attachments/original/1455813997/2015_Election_Review_%28Final_Report%29.pdf?1455813997|website=2015 Election Review|publisher=Liberal Democrats|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Europe, liberal parties have often cooperated with socialist and social democratic parties, as evidenced by the [[Purple (government)|Purple Coalition]] in the Netherlands during the late 1990s and into the 21st century. The Purple Coalition, one of the most consequential in [[History of the Netherlands|Dutch history]], brought together the progressive left-liberal [[Democrats 66|D66]],&lt;ref&gt;Schie and Voermann, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[economic liberal]] and centre-right [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]],&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher et al., p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; and the social democratic [[Dutch Labour Party|Labour Party]] – an unusual combination that ultimately [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|legalised same-sex marriage]], [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands|euthanasia]], and [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|prostitution]] while also instituting a non-enforcement [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|policy on marijuana]].

===Michel Foucault ===
French intellectual [[Michel Foucault]] locates the emergence of liberalism, both as a political philosophy and a mode of governance, in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M., Burchell, G., Gordon, C. and Miller, P. (1991). ''The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality: With two lectures by and an interview with Michel Foucault'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press (p. 92).&lt;/ref&gt;  He especially focuses on [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Ferguson]].  According to Foucault, it was through a double movement, of state centralisation on the one hand and of dispersion and religious dissidence on the other, that this problem of government presented itself clearly for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;(Foucault 1991: 88).&lt;/ref&gt;

The central question, or problem of government, in relation to the birth of liberalism, was how to apply the form of governance of the family, the ‘economy’, to the state as a whole. How to introduce the meticulous attention of the father within the family home and the family unit, to the management of the state?&lt;ref&gt;(Foucault 1991: 92)&lt;/ref&gt;  The birth of liberalism can be located in the response to this question or problem of government. The response witnessed the shift from the dominance of sovereign power to the apparatus of the state, and can be characterised in three important developments:&lt;ref&gt;(Nadesan 2008: 16).&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism, as a ‘rationality’ of governing was, in Foucault’s mind, unique from other previous technologies of governing, as it had as its foundation the assumption that human behaviour should be governed, in the pursuit of fostering the idea that society be understood as a realm separate from the state, not just something that was drawn off of and violated in order to strengthen the state.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, N., O'Malley, P. and Valverde, M. (2006). Governmentality. Annual Review of Law and Social Science, 2 (1), 83–104 (p. 84)&lt;/ref&gt; In a Foucauldian sense, liberalism did not emerge as a doctrine of how to simply govern people, but rather as a technology of governing that arose from the timeless critique of excessive government—"a search for a technology of government that could address the recurrent complaint that authorities were governing too much".&lt;ref&gt;(Rose et al. 2006: 84).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35653">The '''history of nursing in the United Kingdom''' tells of the development of the profession since the 1850s. The [[history of nursing]] itself dates back to ancient times, when the sick were cared for in temples and houses of worship. In the [[History of Christianity in Britain|early Christian era]], [[nursing in the United Kingdom]] was undertaken by certain women in the Church, their services being extended to patients in their homes. These women had no real training by today's standards, but experience taught them valuable skills, especially in the use of herbs and folk drugs, and some gained fame as the physicians of their era.  Remnants of the religious nature of nurses remains in Britain today, especially with the retention of the [[job title]] "[[Nursing sister|Sister]]" for a senior female nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NMH-UK |url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/~nmhuk/index.html |accessdate=24 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716142728/http://www.shef.ac.uk/~nmhuk/index.html |archivedate=16 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth century==
Before the advent of training, nursing was often casual and low paid.  Pay in London [[voluntary hospital]]s was between 6 shillings and 9s 6d a week, with some board and lodging.  Outside London pay was much lower.  Few nurses were described as educated.  Facilities in hospitals were poor, though some began to provide meals for nurses.  Sisters were recruited separately from nurses and were more respectable, and matrons, whose work was largely administrative, even more so.

Nursing in the [[Workhouse infirmary|Poor Law infirmaries]], such as it was, was largely carried out by able-bodied paupers, who were not paid.  In 1866 there were a total of 53 nurses employed in the 11 metropolitan [[workhouse]]s, at an average salary of £20 18s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=6|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Florence Nightingale==

{{Main|Florence Nightingale}}

[[Image:Florence Nightingale.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Florence Nightingale]]
Florence Nightingale is regarded as the founder of modern nursing profession.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Goodrick, and Trish Reay. "Florence Nightingale endures: Legitimizing a new professional role identity." ''Journal of Management Studies'' (2010) 47#1 pp: 55-84.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was no hospital training school for nurses until [[Deaconess's Institute of Kaiserswerth|one was established]] in [[Düsseldorf-Kaiserswerth|Kaiserwerth]], Germany, in 1846. There, Nightingale received the training that enabled her in 1860 to establish, at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London, the [[Nightingale School of Nursing|first school]] designed primarily to train nurses rather than to provide nursing service for the hospital.

In the [[Crimean War]] against Russia, Nightingale was appointed by [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sir Sidney Herbert]] to oversee the introduction of female nurses into the military hospitals in Turkey. In November 1854, Nightingale arrived at the Barrack Hospital at Scutari, with a party of ten nurses and ten nuns. Initially the doctors did not want the nurses there and did not ask for their help, but within ten days fresh casualties arrived from the [[Battle of Inkermann]] and the nurses were fully stretched. Nightingale was horrified at what she found in the makeshift hospital: doctors reusing infected rags, the used rags just remaining in a pile, soldiers left unwashed and bleeding. She introduced sanitary protocols and reduced the casualty rate by fifty percent.

When Nightingale returned from the Crimean War in August 1856, she hid herself away from the public's attention.  For her contribution to Army statistics and comparative hospital statistics in 1860, Nightingale became the first woman to be elected a fellow of the [[Royal Statistical Society|Statistical Society]].

==1858–1902==

===Professionalisation===
When state registration of the medical profession had begun in 1858, many observers pointed to the need for a similar system for nursing. That year, the ''Nursing Record'' (renamed the ''[[British Journal of Nursing]]'' in 1902), a nursing journal, called for 
''"... the whole question of the Registration of trained nurses to be set forth in a succinct form before the profession and the public".''  Support for the regulation of nursing began to become more widespread following the establishment of organised nurse training in 1860.

By the 1880s, the Hospitals Association (an early version of the [[NHS Confederation]]) was committed to the principle of registration for nurses. The Matrons' Committee, comprising the [[matron]]s of the leading hospitals, agreed with registration, but differed in their views of the required length of training, arguing for three years as opposed to the one supported by the Hospitals Association. In 1887, the Hospitals Association over-ruled the matrons and established a non-statutory voluntary register. At this the Matrons' Committee split between one group which supported the Hospitals Association and another faction, led by [[Ethel Gordon Fenwick]], which opposed the new register and sought to align themselves more closely with the medical profession. Florence Nightingale, incidentally, supported neither group and was opposed to any form of regulation for nursing, believing that the essential qualities of the nurse could neither be taught, examined nor regulated.

In 1887, the group of nurses associated with [[Ethel Gordon Fenwick]] formed the [[British Nurses' Association]], which sought ''"... to unite all British nurses in membership of a recognised profession and to provide for their registration on terms, satisfactory to physicians and surgeons, as evidence of their having received systematic training".''

Therefore, two separate voluntary registers now existed. Whereas that maintained by the Hospitals Association was purely an administrative list, the register established by the BNA had a more explicit public protection remit.

By 1892 it was accepted in the [[voluntary hospital]]s that the matron was the head of an independent operation, controlling her own staff and reporting directly to the hospital committee.

In 1901 there were 3,170 paid nurses employed in workhouses, with about 2,000 probationers - about one nurse for 20 patients.  In total there were about 63,500 female nurses and 5,700 male nurses in England and Wales, working both in institutions and, the majority, in patients homes.  The men were almost entirely mental nurses and were not admitted to nurse training schools.  Nurses in workhouses were paid about £17 a year.  Hospital nurses in 1902 were paid around £19 a year, but the cost of maintenance, laundry, uniforms and accommodation which were provided was around £30 a year.  In domiciliary work two guineas a week with meals provided was normal pay, and the work was easier.  In hospitals 12 hour days were normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=55|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Princess Helena and The Royal British Nurses' Association===

[[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Princess Helena]], the daughter of Queen Victoria, played a central role in sponsoring and legitimizing the profession. Helena had a firm interest in nursing, and became President of the [[Royal British Nurses' Association|British Nurses' Association]] upon its foundation in 1887. In 1891, it received the prefix "Royal", and received the [[Royal Charter#United Kingdom|Royal Charter]] the following year. She was a strong supporter of [[nurse registration]], an issue that was opposed by both [[Florence Nightingale]] and leading public figures.&lt;ref name=Chomet119&gt;Seweryn Chomet, ''Helena: A Princess Reclaimed'' (Begell House, New York, 1999)  p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech Helena made in 1893, she made clear that the RBNA was working towards "improving the education and ''status'' of those devoted and self-sacrificing women whose whole lives have been devoted to tending the sick, the suffering, and the dying". In the same speech, she warned about opposition and misrepresentation they had encountered. Although the RBNA was in favour of registration as a means of enhancing and guaranteeing the professional status of trained nurses, its incorporation with the Privy Council allowed it to maintain a list rather than a formal register of nurses.&lt;ref name=Chomet120&gt;Chomet, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, the new Queen, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]], insisted on replacing Helena as President of the Army Nursing Service. In accordance with rank, Helena agreed to resign in Alexandra's favour, and she retained presidency of the Army Nursing Reserve.&lt;ref name=Chomet122&gt;Chomet, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Though thought to be merely an artefact created by society ladies, Helena exercised an efficient and autocratic regime—"if anyone ventures to disagree with Her Royal Highness she has simply said, 'It is my wish, that is sufficient.'"&lt;ref&gt;Georgina Battiscombe, ''Queen Alexandra'' (Constable &amp; Company Ltd, London, 1969) p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

The RBNA gradually went into decline following the [[Nurses Registration Act 1919]]; after six failed attempts between 1904 and 1918, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] passed the bill allowing formal nurse registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; What resulted was the [[Royal College of Nursing]] (RCN), and the RBNA lost membership and dominance. Helena supported the proposed amalgamation of the RBNA with the new RCN, but that proved unsuccessful when the RBNA pulled out of the negotiations. However, Princess Helena remained active in other nursing organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Chomet, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military nursing==
Nightingale laid the foundations of professional nursing with the principles summarised in the book ''[[Notes on Nursing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Summers, ''Angels and Citizens: British Women as Military Nurses 1854–1914'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Her highly publicized exposure of the abysmal care afforded sick and wounded soldiers energized reformers. Queen Victoria in 1860 ordered a hospital to be built to train Army nurses and surgeons, the [[Netley Hospital|Royal Victoria Hospital]]. The hospital opened in 1863 in [[Netley]] and admitted and cared for military patients. Beginning in 1866, nurses were formally appointed to Military General Hospitals.

The [[Army Nursing Service]] (ANS) oversaw the work of the nurses starting in 1881. These military nurses were sent overseas beginning with the [[First Boer War]] (often called Zulu War) from 1879 to 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/army-medical-services/qaranc/9910.aspx|publisher=British Army Website|accessdate=31 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028190846/http://www.army.mod.uk/army-medical-services/qaranc/9910.aspx|archivedate=28 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also dispatched to serve during the [[Egyptian Campaign]] in 1882 and the Sudan War of 1883 to 1884. During the Sudan War members of the Army Nursing Service nursed in hospital ships on the Nile as well as the Citadel in Cairo. Almost 2000 nurses served during the second [[Boer War]], the Anglo-Boer War of 1899 to 1902, alongside nurses who were part of the colonial armies of Australia, Canada and New Zealand. They served in tented field hospitals. 23 Army Nursing sisters from Britain lost their lives from disease outbreaks.&lt;ref name="qaranc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=QAIMNS World War I Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service QAIMNS Nurses|url=http://www.qaranc.co.uk/qaimns.php|publisher=qaranc.co.uk|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queen Alexandra’s Imperial Military Nursing Service.===

In March 1902, ''[[Queen Alexandra’s Imperial Military Nursing Service]]'' ('''QAIMNS''') was established and was named after [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]], who became its President.&lt;ref name=DBWO&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Gordon|first2=David|last2=Doughan|title=Dictionary of British Women's Organisations, 1825-1960|year=2001|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the QAIMNS became a corps in the British Army and was renamed as the '''Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps'''. Since 1950 the organisation has trained nurses, and in 1992 men were allowed to join.&lt;ref name=DBWO/&gt;

The associated Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps Association is a [[registered charity]]. Queen Alexandra was President from 1902 until her death in 1925. The following year she was succeeded by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].

The pressure for state registration grew throughout the 1890s but was undermined by disagreements within the profession over the desired form and purpose of the regulatory system. In 1902, the Midwives Registration [[Act of Parliament|Act]] established the state regulation of [[midwife|midwives]] and, two years later, a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] was established to consider the registration of nurses.

The committee reported in 1904 and set out a detailed and persuasive case for registration. However, the government sat on the report and took no action. Over the next decade, a number of [[Private Member's Bill]]s to establish regulation were introduced but all failed to achieve significant support in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].

====First World War====
By the beginning of the First World War in 1914, military nursing still had only a small role for women in Britain; 10,500 nurses enrolled in [[Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS) and the [[Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service]]. These services dated to 1902 and 1918, and enjoyed royal sponsorship. There also were  74,000 [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] (VAD) nurses who had been enrolled by the Red Cross.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda McBride, ''Quiet Heroines: Story of the Nurses of the Second World War'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; The ranks that were created for the new nursing services were Matron-in-Chief, Principal Matron, Sister and Staff Nurses. Women joined steadily throughout the War. At the end of 1914, there were 2,223 regular and reserve members of the QAIMNS and when the war ended there were 10,404 trained nurses in the QAIMNS.&lt;ref name="qaranc.co.uk"/&gt;

Grace McDougall (1887–1963) was the energetic commandant of the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), which had formed in 1907 as an auxiliary to the home guard in Britain.  McDougall at one point was captured by the Germans but escaped. The British army wanted nothing to do with them so they drove ambulances and ran hospitals and casualty clearing stations for the Belgian and French armies.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Terry, "McDougall ,  Grace Alexandra  (1887–1963)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2004); online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59610, accessed 6 March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Lee, "A Nurse and a Soldier: Gender, Class and National Identity in the First World War Adventures of Grace McDougall and Flora Sandes," ''[[Women's History Review]]'' (2006) 15#1 pp 83-103; Janet Lee,  ''War girls: the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry in the First World War'' (Manchester University Press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The First World War provided the final impetus to the establishment of nursing regulation, partly because of the specific contribution made by nurses to the war effort and also as a reflection of the increased contribution of women more generally in society. The College of Nursing (later the [[Royal College of Nursing]]) was established in 1916 and three years later persuaded a backbench Member of Parliament (MP), Major [[Richard Barnett (sport shooter)|Richard Barnett]], to introduce a private members bill to establish a regulatory system. The bill was finally passed in December 1919 and separate Nurses Registration Acts were passed for England/Wales, Scotland and Ireland, which was still part of the United Kingdom at the time. These acts established the [[General Nursing Council]] for England and Wales and the other bodies which survived intact until the legislative changes in 1979 which were to create the [[Nursing and Midwifery Council|UKCC]] and the National Boards of Nursing. [[Ethel Gordon Fenwick]] was the first nurse on the English register.

The [[National Asylum Workers' Union]] organised strikes at [[Prestwich Hospital]], [[Whittingham Hospital]] and [[Bodmin Hospital]] in 1918. It threatened to organise strikes in all the London asylums in support of a 48-hour week in 1919.  The [[Professional Union of Trained Nurses]] was founded in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=132|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s===
In the 1921 [[Census in the United Kingdom|Census]] 111,501 women and 11,000 men declared that they were nurses.  The registration regime stopped the very small hospitals from offering training.  The first national examination was in 1925. About 40% of the candidates failed.

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] produced its first draft policy statement on the profession in 1926, advocating a 48-hour week, the separation of training schools from hospitals and advocating that the profession should be organised on Trade Union lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=117|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s===
* Foundation of the [[National Society of Male Nurses]].
* The Royal College of Nursing gains its [[royal charter]].
In the 1931 [[Census in the United Kingdom|Census]] 138,670 women and 15,000 men declared that they were nurses. 88% of the women were single, 5% married and 7% widowed or divorced.

In 1930 nurses in the [[voluntary hospital]]s worked 117 hours a fortnight in London and 119 in the provinces. In 1936 the [[London County Council]] introduced a standard 54 hour week for nurses and in 1938 moved to a 96-hour fortnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=123|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 county councils began training courses for assistant nurses to care for the chronic sick.

In 1937 the [[Trades Union Congress]] adopted a “Nurses’ Charter”, demanding a  96-hour fortnight, improvement of the amenities of nurses’ homes and arguing that nurses should be able to live out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brook|first1=Iris|title=Happiness in the Hospital -Recruitment of Nurses|url=https://www.sochealth.co.uk/the-socialist-health-association/socialism-and-health/medicine-today-and-tomorrow/happiness-in-the-hospital/|accessdate=7 June 2017|publisher=Medicine Today and Tomorrow|date=October 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the average nurse was working 104 hours per fortnight.  The [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|Earl of Athlone]] was appointed to chair a committee of inquiry into the arrangements for "recruitment, training and registration and terms and conditions of service" for nurses. It found that about 12,000 new recruits were needed each year. It recommended higher pay, a 96-hour fortnight and four weeks holiday a year, and the removal of unreasonable restrictions on nurses life. It advocated more domestic staff and that grants should be made from public funds to [[Voluntary hospital]]s to pay for these improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=145|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940s===
*  The Nurses Salaries Committee was established in October 1941 with [[Lord Rushcliffe]] as chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=167|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Role of [[Licensed Practical Nurse|state enrolled nurse]] formally recognised, with two years' training instead of three.
* Horder Committee recommends fewer [[nursing school]]s and the introduction of inspection.
* [[Penicillin]] becomes available for civilian use.
* Numbers of male nurses increased as demobilised service men with medical experience join the profession. By 1949 there were about 1300 registered male nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=189|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[National Health Service]] (NHS) is launched in 1948, offering comprehensive health care for all, free at the point of delivery, but paid for through taxation.  [[Whitley Council]]s established for nursing.  Pay for student nurses was set at £200 with a deduction of £100, and for staff nurses £315, rising by increments to £415 with a deduction of £120 for board and lodging.

====Second World War 1939-45====
The armed forces estimated at the beginning of the war that they needed 5000 trained nurses.  Up to 67,000 were thought to be needed to care for the expected air-raid casualties.  This was more than the number of trained nurses in employment.  A Civil Nursing Reserve was set up - 7000 trained nurses, 3000 assistant nurses and also nursing auxiliaries.  The auxiliaries were given fifty hours training in hospital before they started work.
After protests it was agreed that they should not do domestic work. 6,200 from the Civil Nursing Reserve were working in hospitals in June 1940.

The Ministry of Health guaranteed a salary of £40 to nursing students in training, about double what voluntary hospitals were paying before the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abel-Smith|first1=Brian|title=A History of the Nursing Profession|date=1960|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|page=165|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war nurses belonged to [[Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps|Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS), as they had during World War I, and as they remain today. (Nurses belonging to the QAIMNS are informally called "QA"s.) Members of the Army Nursing Service served in every overseas British military campaign during World War II, as well as at military hospitals in Britain. At the beginning of World War II, nurses held officer status with equivalent rank, but were not commissioned officers. In 1941, emergency commissions and a rank structure were created, conforming with the structure used in the rest of the British Army. Nurses were given rank badges and were now able to be promoted to ranks from Lieutenant through to Brigadier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QA World War Two Nursing|url=http://www.qaranc.co.uk/qa_world_war_two_nursing.php|publisher=qaranc.co.uk|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses were exposed to all dangers during the War, and some were captured and became prisoners of war.

* The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) becomes a trade union.
* The [[Nursing Process]] establishes an ethos based on assessment, planning, implementation and evaluation.
* Reform of shift patterns begins
The Briggs Committee was established in 1970 due to pressure from the RCN to consider issues around the quality and nature of nurse training and the place of nursing within the NHS, rather than regulation per se. It reported in 1972 and recommended a number of changes to professional education.  Almost as an afterthought, Briggs also recommended the replacement of the existing regulatory structure (involving nine separate bodies across the United Kingdom) with a unified central council and separate boards in each of the four countries with specific responsibility for education. Six years of debate and delay followed before the modified Briggs proposals formed the basis of the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/16 Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1979]. This was due to the need to take account of [[devolution]], [[Her Majesty's Treasury|Treasury]] misgivings, lack of consensus within the professions (especially from midwives), and a lack of government will to find the parliamentary time to enact the legislation.

===1980s===
* Mass meetings are held over pay, the state of the NHS, clinical grading and the abolition of the enrolled nurse.
* United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC) becomes the profession's new regulatory body in 1983.
In 1983, the UKCC was set up. Its core functions were to maintain a register of UK nurses, midwives and [[health visitor]]s, provide guidance to registrants, and handle professional misconduct complaints.  At the same time, National Boards were created for each of the UK countries.  Their main functions were to monitor the quality of nursing and midwifery education courses, and to maintain the training records of students on these courses.

This structure survived with minor modifications until April 2002, when the UKCC ceased to exist and its functions were taken over by a new [[Nursing and Midwifery Council]] (NMC). The English National Board was also abolished and its quality assurance function was taken on board by the NMC. The other National Boards were also abolished, but new bodies were created in each country to take over their functions, for example, NES in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nursing and Midwifery Council |url=http://www.nmc-uk.org/aArticle.aspx?ArticleID=1634 |accessdate=24 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526111400/http://www.nmc-uk.org/aArticle.aspx?ArticleID=1634 |archivedate=26 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''husting''' originally referred to a native [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] governing assembly, the [[Thing (assembly)|thing]]. By [[metonymy]], the term may now refer to any event, such as debates or speeches, during an election campaign where one or more of the representative candidates are present. The term is used synonymously with [[Stump_speech_(politics)|stump]] in the United States.

==Development of the term==
The origin of the term comes from the [[Old English]] ''hūsting'' and [[Old Norse]] ''hūsþing'', literally "house [[Thing (assembly)|thing]]", an assembly of the household retainers of a king, earl, or chief, contrasted with the [[folkmoot]] (Old English ''folcgemōt''), an assembly of the whole people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

''Husting'', more usually in the plural form but grammatically singular&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite news|quote=Running for parliament is a steep learning curve, full of challenges, and this week brought the most personal one yet: whether to attend '''a hustings''' where far-right characters who have brought their vile agenda to my south London constituency would be on the same platform.|title=I'm standing up to the far right in Lewisham – because Labour isn't|last=Reid|first=Mandu|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 June 2018|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/12/standing-up-to-far-right-unlike-labour-lewisham-byelection-hustings|accessdate=4 September 2018}} (emphasis added)&lt;/ref&gt; ''hustings'', developed to mean a court of the [[City of London]]. This court was formerly the county court for the city and was held before the [[Lord Mayor]], the sheriffs and aldermen, for the purpose of hearing pleas of land, common pleas and appeals from the sheriffs. It had probate jurisdiction and the ability to register wills. The Charter of [[Harthacnut]] (1032) contains a reference to "hustings" weights, which points to the early establishment of this court. It is doubtful{{says who|date=November 2010}} whether courts of this name were held in other towns, but [[John Cowell (jurist)|John Cowell]] (1554–1611) in his ''Interpreter'' (1601) s.v., "Hustings", says that according to [[Fleta]] there were such courts at [[Winchester]], [[York]], [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], the [[Isle of Sheppey]], and elsewhere. However, the passage from Fleta, as the New English Dictionary points out,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} does not necessarily imply this (II. lv. ''Habet etiam Rex curiam in civitatibus ... et in locis ... sicut in Hustingis London'', Winton, est.).

This hustings court jurisdiction eventually became obsolete, but the court still sits occasionally for registering gifts made to the city. Today, the [[Hustings Court]] tradition can be found in some areas of the United States, such as in [[Virginia]], where Hustings Courts formerly decided local criminal and other matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20000509 | title=Word of the Day | publisher=RandomHouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1973 Virginia's Hustings Courts and Corporation Courts were reorganized as city Circuit Courts. Virginia Acts of Assembly 1973, c. 544. See also [http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+17.1-500 Code of Virginia, § 17.1-500].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Richmond, Virginia]], there is also a park called Hustings Court Square,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.courses.vcu.edu/ENG-nae/parks_in_richmond.htm | title=Major Parks in our Richmond's Urban Park System| publisher=Virginia Commonwealth University}}&lt;/ref&gt; where polling votes used to take place.

==Eighteenth and early nineteenth century practice==
The husting was a platform or pavilion, a temporary structure erected at the place of an election. The returning officer (in most borough constituencies the Mayor or equivalent civic dignitary, and in county elections the High Sheriff of the county) was responsible for the detailed timing of the election and the provision of a suitable husting. County elections took place at a single place of election, which was usually the county town or a large town.

On the appointed day the returning officer attended at the husting with the prospective candidates (or the agent of a candidate who was not present in person). The candidates, with a proposer and a seconder for each, addressed the assembled voters. This could sometimes be a difficult task in a large urban constituency, where unpopular speakers might be shouted down.

At the conclusion of the speeches, a show of hands was taken. This was an informal indication of the opinion of the voters and no official record was kept of how many voted for a particular candidate. Sometimes a candidate who found he had little support or otherwise did not want to continue declined to call for a poll. One example of this was seen in the 1784 election for the four seats of the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]]. [[William Pitt the Younger]] was proposed and "was returned on the show of hands", but removed himself from consideration before the polling was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Smith | first=Henry Stooks | title=The Parliaments of England | publisher= Political Reference Publications | year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If after this process there were no more candidates nominated and willing to go to the poll than seats to be filled, the existing candidates were declared elected. This was called an "unopposed return". But if there remained more candidates than vacancies, the polling commenced.

During polling, each vote was declared openly on the husting, with the elector orally declaring for whom he was casting a ballot. The vote was recorded in a poll book, along with the name of each voter (which enabled further enquiries to be made about his eligibility to vote, if a scrutiny was called for at the end of the polling). In certain occasions, additional candidates were nominated as the polling continued, since this gave an opportunity for more speeches. Polling could continue for many days, so long as there were voters wanting to participate and the candidates desired to continue. A maximum of fifteen days for polling was imposed by law in the eighteenth century.

At the end of the polling, the returning officer was required to declare the result from the husting and return the members elected. This could be a problem after a hotly contested election, and rioting was not unheard of. The 1722 election in [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]] was declared void on account of such rioting.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Modern usage==
[[Image:Hustings Oxford West and Abingdon 20050204.jpg|thumb|A pre-election husting at the [[Oxford West and Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford West and Abingdon]] constituency, England]]
{{citations missing|section|date=November 2010}}

In British usage during the 1800s, ''husting'' meant a platform in the Guildhall on which the London court was held.  It evolved to mean a platform upon which the public nomination of candidates for a parliamentary election was made, and from which the candidate addressed the electors.

The [[Ballot Act 1872]] did away with the public declaration of the nomination, however, so the term has not been used in that context since then. The word (usually in the singular form "hustings") now refers to any meeting at which more than one candidate participates. This may involve a combination of a debate, speeches or questions from the electors.

The term is still in use at several universities in the U.K. and Ireland, in connection with student elections.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

===North America===
In American political usage, there is no exactly equivalent term.  The closest phrase is that a person is said to be "stumping" or "on the stump" when involved in any political campaigning, especially speech making. (See [[Stump speech (politics)]]).

In current Canadian usage the word is found only in the plural, to mean the campaign trail (''on the hustings''), or to refer to events of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt; See for example, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/little-talk-on-the-hustings-of-canadas-role-in-libya/article1964142/ Little talk on the hustings of Canada's role in Libya], Globe and Mail March 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19396">The '''"In and Out" scandal''' was a Canadian [[political scandal]] involving improper election spending on the part of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] during the closely contested [[Canadian federal election 2006|2006 federal election]]. Parliamentary hearings into the issue led to a deadlocking of various committees, and then to the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|snap election in 2008]]. On 6 March 2012, charges were dropped as part of a plea deal in which the Conservative Party of Canada and its fundraising arm pleaded guilty to exceeding election spending limits and submitting fraudulent election records, and agreed to repay $230,198.00 for its role in violating Canadian election spending laws.&lt;ref name="The National Post"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/03/06/conservatives-drop-appeal-of-in-and-out-ruling// |title=Conservatives drop appeal of ‘in-and-out’ ruling |publisher=''[[The National Post]]'' |date=2012-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The basic "in and out" scheme involves transfers of money between different levels or organizations within a [[political party]]. [[Elections Canada]] places strict limits on campaign budgets in order to provide an even playing field between the parties. They also directly fund political activity through per-vote financing, as well as reimbursing a major amount of campaign expenses for any riding where the candidate wins over a certain percentage of the votes. In recent elections the per-vote payout has been around $2, while between 50 and 60% of campaign expenses are re-paid if the candidate wins over 10 to 15% of the riding.&lt;ref name=bloc&gt;Andrew McIntosh, [http://communities.canada.com/montrealgazette/blogs/onthehill/archive/2008/04/29/the-original-in-and-out-election-financing.aspx "Ex-MP must pay $16,362 to Bloc for underspending"], ''National Post'', 4 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the second of these two funding sources that is used in the in-and-out scheme. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 federal elections]] the [[Bloc Québécois]] organized a system to inflate apparent campaign spending at the riding level, and thereby receive much higher refunds from Elections Canada.&lt;ref name=bloc/&gt; The Bloc organized "La Méthode In &amp; Out" prior to the elections, having each candidate agree to certain spending numbers in order to inflate the overall cash flows. In exchange, Bloc leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] would sign their nomination papers, a requirement for running as a party candidate in the election.

Large amounts of cash were transferred from the party organization to the individual [[riding association]]s that are in charge of running one candidate's election campaign. The money was then distributed to the volunteers as payments for various expenses. The volunteers then donated that money back to the party.&lt;ref name=bloc/&gt; On the surface it appeared that the ridings were spending much larger amounts of money than normal, enough to drain the party [[war chest]]. In fact, a considerable portion of the money was being returned directly to the party's coffers.

Under normal circumstances the money received by the volunteers would be subject to [[income tax]] and therefore the scheme would be unattractive to them. But because the money was then spent on political donations, it could be written off. The only cost to the volunteer was time in filling out their tax forms - something they were giving up anyway as a volunteer for the party.

The scheme may have remained unknown if not for a court case against former Bloc MP, [[Jean-Paul Marchand]]. Marchand agreed to spend $66,000 as part of the in and out scheme, but spent only $22,276. The Bloc sued Marchand, saying he had broken his contract and owed them $36,362. A Quebec judge agreed with the Bloc, but lowered the amount to $16,362.&lt;ref name=bloc/&gt; When the story broke in 2003 as a result of the court case, the ruling [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] immediately started to implement changes to the election law to stop this process. However, these changes were not implemented before the party lost power in 2006.

== In and Out ==
The current scandal, to which the term "in and out" now largely applies, refers to a scheme implemented by the Conservative Party in the 2006 election, the election that prevented passage of the bill outlawing the practice.

In this case of "in and out", it is held that the scheme was not only intended as a method of gaining additional income, but also as a way to avoid limitations on campaign spending at the national level. Having reached their $18.3 million campaign spending limit, the party transferred $1.3 million to 67 riding offices that had not yet reached their own local campaign limits, which varied but were around $80,000.&lt;ref name=west&gt;Glen McGregor, [http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=222e0456-653b-4dde-b984-945a058a836f "Campaign worker irked Tory brass by testifying, ethics committee hears"], Canwest News Service, 12 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The ridings then returned the money to the party, stating that it was being used to purchase advertising. The ads in question were identical to the party's national ads with the exception of a "paid for by..." message in small print that was added to the end of the ad in post-production.&lt;ref name=west/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;

The scheme was once again noticed only in a roundabout fashion, when some of the riding finance officers asked for the 60% reimbursement from Elections Canada. The first was an invoice submitted by [[Vancouver East]] candidate Elizabeth Pagtakhan; asked to explain a $29,999.70 election expense, Pagtakhan's official agent, Denny Pagtakhan, told an auditor "I think we contributed to TV national advertising. There was no way we can spend our limit so we were asked by the Party if we can help contribute."&lt;ref name=globe&gt;Brodie Fenlon, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080421.wsearchwarrant_new0421/BNStory/National/homehttp:// "Search warrants suggest Tories overspent by $1-million"], ''The Globe and Mail'', 21 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Noticing that the invoices were all from a single company in Toronto, Retail Media, they became suspicious and Commissioner William Corbett started an investigation. Investigator Ronald Lamothe questioned Retail Media about the invoices, notably one for $39,999.91 sent by Steve Halicki's campaign for the riding of York South-Weston. The invoice was on Retail Media letterhead, yet Retail Media stated that they dealt only with the party and "did not generate invoices to candidates or electoral districts."&lt;ref name=globe/&gt; The CEO even went so far to claim that "the invoice must have been altered or created by someone, because it did not conform to the appearance of invoices sent by Retail Media to the Conservative Party of Canada with respect to the media buy."&lt;ref name=star&gt;Tonda MacCharles, [https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/416912 "'Altered' ad invoice began Tory troubles"], ''Toronto Star'', 22 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Steve Halicki's riding, Barbro Soderberg, Halicki's official agent, told investigators she was approached by Conservative Party campaign manager Romolo Cimaroli, who proposed a deposit of about $40,000 into Halicki's campaign account. The funds would be immediately transferred back to the party and recorded as an advertising expense. Despite misgivings, she was reassured by party officials that the transaction was legal.&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;

The Conservative Party denied any documents were doctored or falsified, and claimed that the payments were above board. They stated that regional groups of riding organizations had met to plan out bulk purchases of airtime to be billed to the national party. The "alterations" were simply the editing of the bills at the party headquarters to divide up the amounts that should be billed to each riding.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

==Fallout==
Elections Canada didn't accept the explanation, noting that the money was only sent out to candidates who had not spent close to their $80,000 limit, something the party could not have known before the election started. They also noted that airtime blocks were booked weeks before the ads ran, or the money had been paid to the ridings. In April 2007 the [[Chief Electoral Officer (Canada)|Chief Electoral Officer]], [[Marc Mayrand]], refused to pay the refunds, totaling about $780,000,&lt;ref name=furor/&gt; stating that the party had paid for the ads.&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/04/15/rcmp-tories.html "Mounties search Tory headquarters"], CBC News, 15 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In an obvious parallel with the Bloc events of a decade earlier, the Conservative Party decided to sue Elections Canada to get the money back.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;

On 15 April 2008, Elections Canada and [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) officers raided the Conservative party headquarters in Ottawa.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt; Tipped off, major news organizations and cameramen from the other political parties were already on hand when the RCMP officers arrived. Lamothe's affidavit noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"a deliberate 'in-and-out' scheme conceived to move money from national coffers into and out of the accounts of local campaigns, which have their own spending limits, in order to skirt the national spending limit... Funds were transferred into and out of each of the bank accounts of the 67 campaigns ... entirely under the control of and at the direction of officials of the Conservative Fund of Canada and/or the Conservative Party of Canada... The purpose of the in and out transfers was to provide participating candidates with documentation to support their reimbursement claims for these election expenses."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Garth Turner]], who was elected in 2006 running for the Conservatives but later [[crossing the floor|moved to the Liberals]], went on record stating he was personally aware of one such transaction. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was asked to be the guest speaker ... but before I gave my speech the treasurer gave their report for the annual meeting and they had more than $40,000, which was transferred into their [[bank account]] and then the same day they wrote a [[cheque]] back to the central party. And by transferring $40,000 into their bank account during the campaign they got a 60 per cent rebate.&lt;ref name=star2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Conservative Party of Canada candidates, 2006 Canadian federal election#Sam Goldstein (Trinity-Spadina)|Sam Goldstein]], who ran what ''[[The Ottawa Citizen]]'' described as a Conservative "token campaign" against [[Olivia Chow]] in [[Trinity—Spadina]], later went on record stating that he agrees that the transfers were to pay for national ads.&lt;ref name=citizen&gt;Tim Naumetz and Glen Mcgregor, [http://blog.macleans.ca/2008/08/15/memories-of-moments-of-goldsteinian-candor-past/#comment-17832 "Tories clash with Elections Canada"], ''The Ottawa Citizen'', 23 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He told ''Citizen'' that "Its national advertising is what it is."&lt;ref name=citizen/&gt;

A brief political firestorm erupted over the issue, which was quieted by the 2008 election that started soon after. The [[Official Opposition (Canada)|opposition parties]] repeatedly attacked the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] during [[Question Period]]. The Prime Minister only responded directly to the questions on one occasion, challenging the Liberals to make their accusations outside the chamber where they were not protected from [[parliamentary privilege]].&lt;ref name=furor&gt;Richard Brennan, [https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/271032 "Furor over campaign funds heats up"], ''Toronto Star'', 27 October 208&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative party executives and press contacts stated that there is nothing illegal about transferring money to ridings for advertising, and that all the parties did it. Heather MacIvor at the [[University of Windsor]] noted that the Conservatives were being disingenouous, and that it was the intent to receive the Elections Canada funds that constituted the "in and out".&lt;ref name=star2&gt;Bea Vongdouangchanh, [http://www.thehilltimes.ca/html/index.php?display=story&amp;full_path=2008/april/21/legislation/&amp;c=2 "Conservatives confusing public on 'in and out' financing says Prof. MacIvor"], 21 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==House investigation and snap election==
The issue fell under the purview of the [[Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs|House Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs]], an inter-party group that includes all four [[Whip (politics)|party whips]].

At the time, the committee was chaired by Conservative [[Gary Goodyear]], who the opposition parties claim used his position to delay any debate on the issue, including hours of filibuster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://danamiller.ca/blog/index.cfm/2008/3/6/Conservative-In-and-Out-Scandal "Opposition Removes Committee Chair to Stop Procedural Tricks Preventing Investigation of the 'In and Out' Scandal"], Liberal Party of Canada, 6 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This led to his removal from the position in a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of non-confidence]]. He was replaced by [[Joe Preston (politician)|Joe Preston]] who did not want the position, called no meetings, and then resigned almost immediately. The Conservative party whip, [[Jay Hill]], stated that no new chair would be named unless the opposition parties agree to drop any debate of the in and out scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Bev Vongdouangchanh, [http://www.thehilltimes.ca/html/index.php?display=story&amp;full_path=2008/may/12/legislation/&amp;c=2 "No House Affairs meetings not having adverse effect"], ''The Hill Times'', 12 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining members of Committee, nevertheless, continued to investigate, calling a number of witnesses to testify about the affair. Most of them refused to appear, which led to the issuing of 31 summonses, unparalleled in House history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080805.winandout0805/BNStory/National/home "Committee summons 31 witnesses in Tory 'in-and-out' scheme"], ''The Canadian Press', 5 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The deadlocking of the Procedure and House Affairs committee was one of a number of such actions that had led to a breakdown of the House process. On 14 May, the [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada]], Peter Milliken, said rulings by committee chairs are being routinely overturned by majority votes, even when the rulings are procedurally sound. Such a state of affairs has led to "general lawlessness" at committees.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Bryden, [https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/346245 "Commons speaker decries 'anarchy' in committees"], ''The Canadian Press'', 14 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Partisan fighting, the cause of the problem, was renewed as the parties blamed each other for the problems.

It was this breakdown of procedure that led to the calls for a snap election. [[Stephen Harper]] blamed [[Stéphane Dion]] for the problems when he first hinted on 14 August that an election might be called.&lt;ref name=election&gt;Daniel Leblanc and Campbell Clark, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080814.wharper15/BNStory/National/home "Harper threatens election to end 'dysfunction'"], ''The Globe and Mail'', 14 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the in and out hearings as a [[kangaroo court]], he stated that the committees were being ruled by a "tyranny of the majority".&lt;ref name=election/&gt; No breakthrough was forthcoming, and the  [[Canadian federal election, 2008|election call]] was made on 27 August.

==Continuing controversy==
{{outdated section|date=January 2017}}
The court case against Elections Canada is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/elections-canada-takes-tories-to-task-over-hidden-campaign-expenses/article1834673/page2/ |title=Elections Canada takes Tories to task over hidden campaign expenses |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=2010-12-12 |first=Joan |last=Bryden}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservatives claimed to have won a victory when their case against Elections Canada returned a [[court decision|decision]] suggesting that the body had overstepped its mandate. However, this ruling was then overturned on [[appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Chase, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/court-quashes-decision-tories-hailed-as-campaign-finance-vindication/article1925509/ "Court quashes decision Tories hailed as campaign-finance vindication"], ''The Globe and Mail'', 1 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservatives sought leave to appeal that court ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada, which was rejected on May 4, 2011. No explanation was given, as is usual in such instances. The decision means that the Conservatives may not use local expenses as a means of reducing their 2006 election expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Glen McGregor, [http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/court+hear+appear+Tory+expenses+case/4732745/story.html "Top court won’t hear appeal of Tory expenses case"], ''The Ottawa Citizen'', May 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 and 2011, several former Conservatives came forward, saying they were punished for refusing to take part in the scheme. [[Inky Mark]] of [[Manitoba]] and [[Helena Guergis]] of [[Ontario]] both state they were approached in 2006 to take funds from the federal party and then return them. Both refused. They join similar claims made earlier by [[David Marler]] of [[Quebec]], and [[Dave MacKenzie (politician)|Dave Mackenzie]] of Ontario, who was noted as also refusing the funds although he has not spoken publicly on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Ditchburn, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/former-tory-mps-speak-out-against-in-and-out-campaign-financing/article1929865/ "Former Tory MPs speak out against ‘in-and-out’ campaign financing"], ''The Globe and Mail'', 4 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 2011, 4 senior Conservative Party members were charged in the In and Out Scandal under the [[Elections Canada Act]] with overspending over $1 million in the 2006 election including allegations that Conservative election expense documents submitted to Elections Canada were "false or misleading" and attempted to fraudulently gain almost $1 million in refunds from taxpayers. Senator [[Doug Finley]], (the party's campaign director in 2006 and 2008, and the husband of [[Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development|Human Resources Development Minister]] [[Diane Finley]]), Senator [[Irving Gerstein]], [[Michael Donison]] (former national party director) and [[Susan Kehoe]] (who has served as an interim party executive director) all face 3 months in jail, $1000 in fines or both.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Chase, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/tory-senators-face-elections-canada-charges-over-campaign-spending/article1920146/ "Tory senators face Elections Canada charges over campaign spending"], ''The Globe and Mail'', 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2012, charges were dropped as part of a plea deal which saw the Conservative Party plead guilty over the 'In and Out' scandal, agreeing to repay $230,198.00 for its role in the scheme.&lt;ref name="The National Post"/&gt;

==Background==
Jason Kessler graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] with a bachelor of arts in psychology in 2009. Prior to his involvement in political extremism, Kessler has written that he was employed in various working class jobs as a dishwasher, gym technician, truck driver and handyman.&lt;ref name="kessler1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jasonkessler.us/about/|title=About Jason Kessler|date=October 30, 2017 |accessdate=October 30, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014546/http://jasonkessler.us/about/ |archivedate=November 7, 2017 |quote=Prior to becoming a writer and activist he did various working class jobs from dishwasher and gym technician to truck driver and handyman.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, Kessler began his original blog JasonKessler.net.&lt;ref name="kessler2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jasonkessler.net/|title=JasonKessler.net|date=December 10, 2015|accessdate=October 30, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229204224/http://www.jasonkessler.net/|archivedate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was used to publish and take credit for the work of another Jason Kessler, which included a [[Noir fiction|noir crime novel]], ''Badland Blues,'' as well as a work of poetry, ''Midnight Road''.&lt;ref name="kessler1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kessler3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/04/not-that-jason-kessler|title=Not That Jason Kessler|date=December 4, 2017|accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, he revealed lewd and offensive tweets made by Charlottesville vice-mayor and councilman Wes Bellamy, who is also a teacher at Charlottesville's [[Albemarle High School (Virginia)|Albemarle High School]]. Bellamy first drew criticism from Kessler when he called a press conference to call for the removal of the [[Robert E. Lee]] statue in Charlottesville in March 2016. In December, Kessler began circulating a petition demanding that Bellamy resign or be removed from office.&lt;ref name="kessler5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/34520495/group-files-petition-to-have-charlottesville-vice-mayor-bellamy-recalled|title=Group Files Petition to Have Charlottesville Vice Mayor Bellamy Recalled|publisher=WVIR News|date=February 16, 2017 |access-date=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing investigations, Bellamy voluntarily resigned from his teaching position at Albemarle High School in December 2016.&lt;ref name="kessler6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2016/12/01/virginia-board-of-education-member-resigns-after-vulgar-tweets-surface/|title=Virginia Board of Education member resigns after vulgar tweets surface|publisher=Washington Post|date=December 1, 2016 |access-date=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, while attempting to gain signatures for his petition Kessler was arrested for [[misdemeanor]] [[assault]] after punching a man in the face. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 50 hours of [[community service]].&lt;ref name="assault"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsplex.com/content/news/Jason-Kessler-pleads-guilty-to-assault--418532093.html|title=Jason Kessler pleads guilty to assault charge|publisher=CBS 19 News|date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Kessler was contracted to write two pieces for the ''[[Daily Caller]]''.&lt;ref name=nm/&gt; He wrote another piece in May about the first protests in Charlottesville over the statue of Lee.&lt;ref name=nm/&gt; Kessler has also written several posts for the anti-immigrant white nationalist site [[VDare]].&lt;ref name=nm&gt;[http://www.nationalmemo.com/right-wing-media-provided-home-white-supremacist-organized-charlottesville-rally/ nationalmemo.com: "Right-Wing Media Provided Home For White Supremacist Before He Organized Charlottesville Rally"], August 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; One of Kessler's posts claimed that the government was waging [[white genocide conspiracy theory|genocide against white people]] by policies that cause low Caucasian birth rates.&lt;ref name=nm/&gt;

After ''[[ProPublica]]'' contacted ''the Daily Caller'' pointing out Kessler's ties to white supremacist groups, the outlet severed its ties with Kessler, and its Executive Editor Paul Conner defended his editorial judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/author/jasonkessler/|title=Jason Kessler - The Daily Caller|date=June 15, 2017|website=archive.org|accessdate=August 21, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615054638/http://dailycaller.com/author/jasonkessler/|archivedate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/things-got-left-out-of-the-daily-callers-report-confederate-monument-rally|title=A Few Things Got Left Out of The Daily Caller's Report on Confederate Monument Rally|first=A.C.|last=Thompson|date=May 31, 2017|website=propublica.org|accessdate=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kessler was sworn in as a member of the far right organization the [[Proud Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Tom|title=Who are the alt-right leaders and provocateurs addressing the Charlottesville white nationalist rally?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/alt-right-leaders-are-addressing-largest-white-nationalist-rally-decades-650096|accessdate=August 21, 2017|work=Newsweek|date=August 12, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proud Boys founder [[Gavin McInnes]] said that he kicked Kessler out of the group once his views on race became known.&lt;ref name=globeandmail&gt;{{cite news|last1=Houpt|first1=Simon|title=Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes's path to the far-right frontier|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/gavin-mcinnes-path-to-the-far-rightfrontier/article36024918/|accessdate=August 21, 2017|work=Globe and Mail|date=August 18, 2017|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Unite the Right rally}}
Kessler was one of the organizers of the Unite the Right rally on August 12, 2017. The rally was a protest of the removal of the statue of [[Robert E. Lee]], a cause Kessler had taken up a year earlier when he began his crusade against Bellamy. Kessler was also involved in a smaller protest of the removal of the statue on May 14, 2017 which ended in a torch-lit march. At this event, he was arrested for failure to obey an officer's commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/three-including-jason-kessler-arrested-during-lee-park-counter-protest/article_a2445258-3988-11e7-bb48-634a1a44cc32.html|title=Three, including Jason Kessler, arrested during Lee Park counter-protest|publisher=The Daily Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 11, Kessler appeared at town hall to promote his rally, but also distance himself from another rally that was held by the [[Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/kessler-discusses-kkk-unite-the-right-rallies-and-his-political/article_610ca84a-66a0-11e7-af48-1389a3205b81.html|title=Kessler discusses KKK, Unite the Right rallies and his political beliefs|publisher=The Daily Progress|date=July 11, 2017|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, Kessler and most speakers scheduled to attend the rally were described by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) as [[alt-right]] leaders. The ADL's director said that Kessler was listed because of both his statements and his activities.&lt;ref name=nbcadl&gt;[http://www.nbc29.com/story/35966208/adl-lists-kessler-other-unite-the-right-speakers-as-white-supremacists nbc29.com: "ADL Lists Kessler, Other 'Unite The Right' Speakers as White Supremacists"], July 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Kessler responded by calling the ADL hypocritical for "attacking uppity whites when they support the ethno-state of Israel" and saying he was "happy to be considered the enemy of the ADL".&lt;ref name=nbcadl/&gt;

On August 7, the city manager attempted to change the location of the rally, away from Emancipation Park towards McIntire Park. The city manager confirmed that Kessler had a [[First Amendment]] right to protest but stressed the city's need to protect public safety.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;[http://www.c-ville.com/rally-relocation-city-okays-permit-mcintire-park-kessler-refuses-change/ c-ville.com: "Rally relocation: City okays permit for McIntire Park, Kessler refuses to change"], August 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, the [[Rutherford Institute]] and the Virginia state branch of the [[ACLU]] supported Kessler in an [[injunction]] lawsuit, later known as ''Kessler v City of Charlottesville'', in the United States District Court. They pointed out that "Two other groups that oppose Kessler's message, which have called on thousands of protesters to attend, have been granted permits by the city for downtown parks close to Emancipation Park on August 12." Arguments were heard in [[Glen E. Conrad|Judge Glen Conrad]]'s courtroom on the afternoon of August 11. The court enjoined the city from revoking Kessler's permit to conduct a demonstration at Emancipation Park on August 12, and the rally went ahead.&lt;ref name=dela&gt;[http://www.realnewsdelaware.net/index.php/2017/08/11/unite-right-rally-tomorrow-charlottesville-va/ realnewsdelaware.com: "“Unite the Right” rally tomorrow in Charlottesville, VA"], August 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The rally on August 12 turned violent and resulted in the [[Unite the Right rally#Vehicular attack and homicide|death of Heather Heyer]], when one of the rally attendees drove at high speed into a crowd of counter-protestors several blocks from the rally.&lt;ref name="NYT Heyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT Heyer" /&gt; On the day following the rally Kessler attempted to hold a news conference in front of Charlottesville City Hall which was quickly overtaken by protesters. However, before ending the short news conference Kessler stated "I disavow any political violence and what happened yesterday was tragic." He also posted videos online in which he blames the city for the violence and death.&lt;ref name="kessler7"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/kessler-blames-city-officials-as-news-conference-dissolves-into-chaos/article_cc7ae852-8096-11e7-8198-bbb38b7b63d1.html|title=Kessler blames city officials as news conference dissolves into chaos|author=Chris Saurez|publisher=The Daily Progress|date=August 13, 2017|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2017, Kessler contradicted his previous statement by tweeting "Heather Heyer was a fat, disgusting Communist. Communists have killed 94 million.

On September 6, 2018, a jury in Charlottesville ordered Jeffrey Winder to pay a fine of $1 and no jail times for the misdemeanor assault charge against Kessler that took place on August 13, 2017. Winder had appealed his original February, 2018 guilty finding, which included a 30-day jail sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chappell |first=Bill |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/09/06/645177784/jury-fines-man-1-for-punching-charlottesville-rally-organizer |title=Jury Fines Man $1 For Punching Charlottesville Rally Organizer |work=[[NPR]] |date=2018-09-06 |accessdate=2018-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Kessler applied for a permit to hold a rally in Charlottesville in August 2018, on the anniversary of the first march.

However, other far-right individuals and groups who participated in the first Unite the Right rally, including [[Richard B.

'''The Justice Bell''' (''The Women's Liberty Bell'') is a replica of the [[Liberty Bell]] made in 1915. It was created to promote the cause for [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] in the United States from 1915-1920. The bell is on permanent display at the [[Washington Memorial Chapel]] in [[Valley Forge National Park]] in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhm.org/blog/we-all-know-the-liberty-bell-but-have-you-heard-of-the-justice-bell/|title=We All Know the Liberty Bell, but have you heard of the "Justice Bell?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Casting and design ==
The Justice Bell was commissioned by suffragist, [[Katherine Wentworth Ruschenberger]] in 1915 and was cast by the [[Meneely Bell Foundry]] in [[Troy, New York]]. The Justice Bell is a [[replica]] of the [[Liberty Bell]], with a few minor design differences. The Justice Bell does not have a crack, and the words, "establish JUSTICE" were added on the top line of the inscription. Also, the Liberty Bell was cast in London, and the Justice Bell was cast in Troy, New York.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The inscription on the Justice Bell reads: 

&lt;blockquote style="text-align: center; font-size: 120%; font-variant:small-caps;"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
establish JUSTICE
Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof
Meneeley Bell Co
Troy, NY
MCMXV&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Suffrage awareness tours and the 19th Amendment==
In an effort to raise awareness for women's suffrage, the bell went on 5,000 mile tour In 1915, visiting all 67 [[Pennsylvania counties]], on the bed of a modified pick-up truck.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The bell's clapper was chained to its side as a symbol of how women were being silenced by being unable to vote. The truck carried a sign with the slogan of the suffragist moment: [[Votes for Women (speech)|"Votes for Women"]], a phrase coined by [[Mark Twain]] as the title of his famous speech in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Flyers stating the tour's mission were handed out to spectators. An excerpt reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Woman's Liberty Bell - "Liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants thereof" was the message of The Liberty Bell of 1776. It proclaimed the birth of a new nation "DEDICATED TO THE PROPOSITION THE GOVERNMENTS DERIVE THEIR POWER FROM THE [[Consent of the governed|CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED]]" AND THAT "TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION IS TYRNNY." Today, fifty million of these inhabitants are women ... The new bell is the Women's Liberty Bell, which is to ring for the first time on the day that the Women of Pennsylvania are granted the right to vote ...The Liberty bell 1776 rang to "Proclaim Liberty" to create our nation "The Woman's Liberty Bell" will ring to establish justice to complete our nation. Help break the chains that hold the bronze clapper silent Vote "Yes" on the Suffrage Amendment on Election Day Pennsylvania&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Justice Bell was met by large crowds, marching bands, and parades everywhere it went. The reception was particularly notable in large cities such as New York City and Philadelphia. On October 22, 1915, the bell was welcomed to Philadelphia, joining in a parade of 8000 people, witnessed by a crowd of 100,000 people. [[Anna Howard Shaw]]'s ''Yellow Suffrage'' automobile also appeared in the procession. The parade on [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] led to a ceremony held at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]], which was attended by many dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/10/23/100180821.pdf|title=8,000 March in Philadelphia|last=The New York Times|first=|date=October 23, 1915|website=www.nytimes.com|publisher=|access-date=Feb 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bell also traveled to other states in 1920 to raise awareness for the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] of the U.S. Constitution, which would give women the right to vote. The Justice Bell was taken to the first national convention of the [[National Woman's Party|Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (National Women's Party)]] in Washington, D.C. It was also present at the national suffrage convention in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailylocal.com/article/DL/20150911/NEWS/150919954|title=100 years for 'Justice Bell'|last=Rellahan|first=Michael P.|date=September 11, 2015|website=www.dailylocal.com|publisher=|access-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] was ratified on August 18, 1920. The Justice Bell was sounded at a celebration ceremony led by Katherine Wentworth Ruschenberger was held on the steps of [[Independence Hall]] in Philadelphia on September 25, 1920. Two of [[Susan B. Anthony|Susan B. Anthony's]] nieces were among the many dignitaries in attendance. The bell rang 48 times, once for every state in the union at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justicebell.org/philadelphial-celebration|title=Philadelphia's 1920 Celebration of the 19th Amendment|last=|first=|date=|website=www.justicebell.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Land reform in the Philippines''' has long been a contentious issue rooted in the Philippines's [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish Colonial Period]].  Some efforts began during the American Colonial Period with renewed efforts during the Commonwealth, following independence, during Martial Law and especially following the [[People Power Revolution]] in 1986.  The current law, the [[Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program]], was passed following the revolution and recently extended until 2014

==History==
Much like [[Mexico]] and other [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies in the Americas]], the Spanish settlement in the Philippines revolved around the [[encomienda]] system of [[plantation]]s, known as [[hacienda]]s.  As the 19th Century progressed, industrialization and liberalization of trade allowed these encomiendas to expand their [[cash crop]]s, establishing a strong [[Sugar industry of the Philippines|sugar industry in the Philippines]], especially in the [[Visayas|Visayan island]] of [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]].

===American period===
The United States of America took possession of the Philippines following the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898 and after putting down the subsequent rebellion in the [[Philippine–American War]]. The [[Second Philippine Commission]], the Taft Commission, viewed economic development as one of its top three goals.&lt;ref name=Dolan&gt;{{cite web|title=Ronald E. Dolan, ed. ''Philippines: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1991|url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/16.htm|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 93% of the islands' land area was held by the government and [[William Howard Taft]], [[Governor-General of the Philippines]], argued for a liberal policy so that a good portion could be sold off to American investors.&lt;ref name=Dolan /&gt; Instead, the [[United States Congress]], influenced by agricultural interests that did not want competition from the Philippines, in the [[1902 Land Act]], set a limit of 16 hectares of land to be sold or leased to American individuals and 1,024 hectares to American corporations.&lt;ref name=Dolan /&gt; This and a downturn in the investment environment discouraged the foreign-owned plantations common in [[British Malaya]], the [[Dutch East Indies]], and [[French Indochina]].&lt;ref name=Dolan /&gt;

Further the U.S. [[Federal Government]] faced the problem of much of the private land being owned by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and controlled by Spanish [[cleric]]s. The American government—officially secular, hostile to continued Spanish control of much of the land of the now-American colony, and long [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|hostile to Catholics]]—negotiated a settlement with the Church handing over its land.

The 1902 [[Philippine Organic Act (1902)|Philippine Organic Act]] was a constitution for the Insular Government, as the U.S. civil administration was known. This act, among other actions, disestablished the Catholic Church as the state religion. The United States government, in an effort to resolve the status of the friars, negotiated with the Vatican. The church agreed to sell the friars' estates and promised gradual substitution of Filipino and other non-Spanish priests for the friars. It refused, however, to withdraw the religious orders from the islands immediately, partly to avoid offending Spain. In 1904 the administration bought for $7.2&amp;nbsp;million the major part of the friars' holdings, amounting to some {{convert|166000|ha|acre}}, of which one-half was in the vicinity of Manila. The land was eventually resold to Filipinos, some of them tenants but the majority of them estate owners.&lt;ref name=Seekins1993US-Rule&gt;{{Citation|last=Seekins &lt;!-- chapter author --&gt;|first=Donald M.|editor-last=Dolan|editor-first=Ronald E.|url=http://memory.loc.govfrd/cs/phtoc.html|title=Philippines: A Country Study|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |year=1993|edition=4th|chapter-url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ph0026)|chapter=The First Phase of United States Rule, 1898–1935|accessdate=2007-12-25|ref=Seekins1993US-Rule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth Period===
During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American Colonial Period]], [[tenant farmer]]s complained about the [[sharecropping]] system, as well as by the dramatic increase in population which added economic pressure to the tenant farmers' families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippine history American Colony and Philippine Commonwealth (1901–1941)|url = http://www.asia.msu.edu/seasia/Philippines/History/hist_AmerColony.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071010133830/http://www.asia.msu.edu/seasia/Philippines/History/hist_AmerColony.html|archivedate = 10 October 2007 |publisher= MSU | work = Windows on Asia|accessdate=2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an [[agrarian reform]] program was initiated by the Commonwealth. However, success of the program was hampered by ongoing clashes between tenants and landowners.

An example of these clashes includes one initiated by [[Benigno Ramos]] through his ''[[Sakdalista]]'' movement,{{Sfn | Roces | Luna | Arcilla | 1986 | p = 140}} which advocated tax reductions, land reforms, the breakup of the large estates or ''[[hacienda]]s'', and the severing of American ties. The uprising, which occurred in Central Luzon in May 1935, claimed about a hundred lives

====Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933====
When the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] was established, President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] implemented the Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"&gt;Manapat, Carlos, et al.'' Economics, Taxation, and Agrarian Reform''. Quezon City: C&amp;E Pub., 2010.Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this act was to regulate the share-tenancy contracts by establishing minimum standards.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt; Primarily, the Act provided for better tenant-landlord relationship, a 50–50 sharing of the crop, regulation of interest to 10% per agricultural year, and a safeguard against arbitrary dismissal by the landlord.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt; The major flaw of this law was that it could be used only when the majority of [[Sangguniang Bayan|municipal councils]] in a province petitioned for it.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt; Since landowners usually controlled such councils, no province ever asked that the law be applied. Therefore, Quezón ordered that the act be mandatory in all [[Central Luzon]] provinces.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt; However, contracts were good only for one year. By simply refusing the renew their contract, landlords were able to eject tenants. As a result, peasant organizations agitated in vain for a law that would make the contract automatically renewable for as long as the tenants fulfilled their obligations.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt;

In 1936, this Act was amended to get rid of its loophole, but the landlords made its application relative and not absolute. Consequently, it was never carried out in spite of its good intentions. In fact, by 1939, thousands of peasants in [[Central Luzon]] were being threatened with wholesale eviction.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt; By the early 1940s, thousands of tenants in Central Luzon were ejected from their farmlands and the rural conflict was more acute than ever.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt;

Therefore, during the Commonwealth period, agrarian problems persisted.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt; This motivated the government to incorporate a cardinal principle on social justice. Dictated by the social justice program of the government, expropriation of landed estates and other landholdings commenced. Likewise, the National Land Settlement Administration (NSLA) began an orderly settlement of public agricultural lands. At the outbreak of the Second World War, major settlement areas containing more than 65,000 hectares were already established.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt;

===Roxas Administration===
When [[Republic Day (Philippines)|the Philippines gained its independence]] in 1946, much of the land was held by a small group of wealthy landowners.  There was much pressure on the democratically elected government to redistribute the land.  At the same time, many of the democratically elected office holders were landowners themselves or came from land-owning families.

In 1946, shortly after his induction to Presidency, [[Manuel Roxas]] proclaimed the Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933 effective throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt; However problems of [[land tenure]] continued. In fact these became worse in certain areas.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt; Among the remedial measures enacted was Republic Act No. 1946 likewise known as the Tenant Act which provided for a 70–30 sharing arrangements and regulated share-tenancy contracts.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt; It was passed to resolve the ongoing peasant unrest in Central Luzon.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt;

As part of his Agrarian Reform agenda, President [[Elpidio Quirino]] issued on 23 October 1950 Executive Order No. 355 which replaced the National Land Settlement Administration with Land Settlement Development Corporation (LASEDECO) which takes over the responsibilities of the Agricultural Machinery Equipment Corporation and the Rice and Corn Production Administration.&lt;ref name="dar.gov.ph"&gt;[http://www.dar.gov.ph/ar_history.html Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) – Organizational Chart]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramon Magsaysay administration===
[[Image:President Magsaysay at his study at Malacañang Palace c.1953.jpg|300px|thumb|right|President Ramon Magsaysay at the Presidential Study, Malacañan Palace]]
To amplify and stabilize the functions of the Economic Development Corps (EDCOR), President [[Ramon Magsaysay]] worked&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; for the establishment of the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA),&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"&gt;Molina, Antonio. ''The Philippines: Through the centuries''. Manila: University of Sto. Tomas Cooperative, 1961. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; which took over from the EDCOR and helped in the giving of some sixty-five thousand acres to three thousand indigent families for settlement purposes.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; Again, it allocated some other twenty-five thousand to a little more than one thousand five hundred landless families, who subsequently became [[farmers]].&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

As further aid to the rural people,&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; the president established the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Administration (ACCFA). The idea was for this entity to make available rural credits. Records show that it did grant, in this wise, almost ten million dollars. This administration body next devoted its attention to cooperative marketing.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

Along this line of help to the rural areas, President Magsaysay initiated in all earnestness the artesian wells campaign. A group-movement known as the Liberty Wells Association was formed and in record time managed to raise a considerable sum for the construction of as many artesian wells as possible. The socio-economic value of the same could not be gainsaid and the people were profuse in their gratitude.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

Finally, vast irrigation projects, as well as enhancement of the Ambuklao Power plant and other similar ones, went a long way towards bringing to reality the rural improvement program advocated by President Magsaysay.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

President Ramón Magsaysay enacted the following laws as part of his Agrarian Reform Program:
* Republic Act No. 1160 of 1954 – Abolished the LASEDECO and established the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA) to resettle dissidents and landless farmers. It was particularly aimed at rebel returnees providing home lots and farmlands in Palawan and Mindanao.
* Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act of 1954) – Governed the relationship between landowners and tenant farmers by organizing share-tenancy and leasehold system. The law provided the security of tenure of tenants. It also created the Court of Agrarian Relations.
* Republic Act No. 1400 (Land Reform Act of 1955) – Created the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) which was responsible for the acquisition and distribution of large tenanted rice and corn lands over 200 hectares for individuals and 600 hectares for corporations.
* Republic Act No. 821 (Creation of Agricultural Credit Cooperative Financing Administration) – Provided small farmers and share tenants loans with low interest rates of six to eight percent.&lt;ref name="dar.gov.ph"/&gt;

===Macapagal administration===

====Land Reform Code====
{{main|Agricultural Land Reform Code}}
The '''Agricultural Land Reform Code''' (RA 3844) was a major [[Philippine]] [[land reform]] law enacted in 1963 under President [[Diosdado Macapagal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1963/ra_3844_1963.html|title=Republic Act No. 3844 : The Agricultural Land Reform Code of the Philippines|date=8 August 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The code declared that it was State policy

#To establish owner-cultivatorship and the economic family-size farm as the basis of Philippine agriculture and, as a consequence, divert landlord capital in agriculture to industrial development;
#To achieve a dignified existence for the small farmers free from pernicious institutional restraints and practices;
#To create a truly viable social and economic structure in agriculture conducive to greater productivity and higher farm incomes;
#To apply all labor laws equally and without discrimination to both industrial and agricultural wage earners;
#To provide a more vigorous and systematic land resettlement program and public land distribution; and
#To make the small farmers more independent, self-reliant and responsible citizens, and a source of genuine strength in our democratic society.

and, in pursuance of those policies, established the following
#An agricultural leasehold system to replace all existing share tenancy systems in agriculture;
#A declaration of rights for agricultural labor;
#An authority for the acquisition and equitable distribution of agricultural land;
#An institution to finance the acquisition and distribution of agricultural land;
#A machinery to extend credit and similar assistance to agriculture;
#A machinery to provide marketing, management, and other technical services to agriculture;
#A unified administration for formulating and implementing projects of land reform;
#An expanded program of land capability survey, classification, and registration; and
#A judicial system to decide issues arising under this Code and other related laws and regulations.

===Marcos administration===
On 10 September 1971, President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] signed the Code of Agrarian Reform of the Philippines into law which established the [[Department of Agrarian Reform]], effectively replacing the Land Authority.

In 1978, the DAR was renamed the Ministry of Agrarian Reform.

On 26 July 1987, following the [[People Power Revolution]], the department was re-organized through Executive Order (EO) No. 129-A.

In 1988, the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law created the [[Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program]] which is also known as CARP.

===Corazon Aquino administration===
President Corazon Aquino envisioned agrarian and land reform as the centerpiece of her administration's social legislative agenda. However, her family background and social class as a privileged daughter of a wealthy and landed clan became a lightning rod of criticisms against her land reform agenda. On 22 January 1987, less than a month before the ratification of the 1987 Constitution, agrarian workers and farmers marched to the historic Mendiola Street near the [[Malacañan Palace]] to demand genuine land reform from Aquino's administration. However, the march turned violent when Marine forces fired at farmers who tried to go beyond the designated demarcation line set by the police. As a result, 12 farmers were killed and 19 were injured in this incident now known as the [[Mendiola massacre]]. This incident led some prominent members of the Aquino Cabinet to resign their government posts.

In response to calls for agrarian reform, President Aquino issued Presidential Proclamation 131 and Executive Order 229 on 22 July 1987, which outlined her land reform program, which included sugar lands. In 1988, with the backing of Aquino, the new [[Congress of the Philippines]] passed [[List of Philippine laws|Republic Act]] No. 6657, more popularly known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law." The law paved the way for the redistribution of agricultural lands to tenant-farmers from landowners, who were paid in exchange by the government through [[just compensation]] but were also allowed to retain not more than five hectares of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanggol.org/environmental_laws/RA6657.html|title=Section 6, Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law|publisher=Web.archive.org|accessdate=2010-03-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823212620/http://www.tanggol.org/environmental_laws/RA6657.html|archivedate=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, corporate landowners were also allowed under the law to "voluntarily divest a proportion of their [[stock|capital stock]], equity or participation in favor of their workers or other qualified beneficiaries", in lieu of turning over their land to the government for redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanggol.org/environmental_laws/RA6657.html|title=Section 31, Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law|publisher=Web.archive.org|accessdate=2010-03-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823212620/http://www.tanggol.org/environmental_laws/RA6657.html|archivedate=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the flaws in the law, the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality in 1989, declaring that the implementation of the comprehensive agrarian reform program (CARP) provided by the said law, was "a revolutionary kind of expropriation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Association of Small Landowners v. Luz|vol=175|reporter=SCRA|opinion=343|pinpoint=386|court=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]|date=14 July 1989|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1989/jul1989/gr_78742_1989.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the implementation of CARP, Aquino was not spared from the controversies that eventually centered on [[Hacienda Luisita]], a 6,453-hectare estate located in the Province of [[Tarlac]], which she, together with her siblings inherited from her father [[Jose Cojuangco]] (Don Pepe).&lt;ref name=pdihl&gt;{{cite news|author=Russell Arador |title=Life once 'sweeter' at Hacienda Luisita |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=64019 |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=4 May 2007 |accessdate=2008-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005095533/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view_article.php?article_id=64019 |archivedate= 5 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argued that Aquino bowed to pressure from relatives by allowing stock redistribution under Executive Order 229. Instead of land distribution, Hacienda Luisita reorganized itself into a corporation and distributed stock. As such, ownership of agricultural portions of the hacienda were transferred to the corporation, which in turn, gave its shares of stocks to farmers.&lt;ref name=pdihl/&gt;

The arrangement remained in force until 2006, when the [[Department of Agrarian Reform (Philippines)|Department of Agrarian Reform]] revoked the stock distribution scheme adopted in Hacienda Luisita, and ordered instead the redistribution of a large portion of the property to the tenant-farmers. The Department stepped into the controversy when in 2004, violence erupted over the retrenchment of workers in the Hacienda, eventually leaving seven people dead.&lt;ref name=pdihl/&gt;

===Ramos administration===
President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] speeded the implementation of the [[Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program]] (CARP) of former President [[Corazon Aquino]] in order to meet the ten-year time frame. However, there were constraints such as the need to firm up the database and geographic focus, generate funding support, strengthen inter-agency cooperation, and mobilize implementation partners, like the non-government organizations, local governments, and the business community.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt; In 1992, the [[Philippine Government|government]] acquired and distributed 382 hectares of land with nearly a quarter of a million farmer-[[beneficiaries]]. This constituted 41% of all land titles distributed by the [[Department of Agrarian Reform (Philippines)|Department of Agrarian Reform]] (DAR) during the last thirty years. But by the end of 1996, the DAR had distributed only 58.25% of the total area it was supposed to cover. From January to December 1997, the DAR distributed 206,612 hectares. That year, since 1987, the DAR had distributed a total of 2.66&amp;nbsp;million hectares which benefited almost 1.8&amp;nbsp;million [[tenant farmer|tenant]]-[[farmers]].&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt;

One major problem that the Ramos administration faced was the lack of funds to support and implement the program.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt; The Php50&amp;nbsp;million, allotted by R.A. No. 6657 to finance the CARP from 1988 to 1998, was no longer sufficient to support the program. To address this problem, Ramos signed R.A. No. 8532 to amend the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) which further strengthened the CARP by extending the program to another ten years.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt; Ramos signed this law on 23 February 1998 –  a few months before the end of Ramos' term.&lt;ref name="Manapat, Carlos 2010"/&gt;

===Arroyo administration===
On 27 September 2004, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], signed Executive Order No. 364, and the Department of Agrarian Reform was renamed to Department of Land Reform. This EO also broadened the scope of the department, making it responsible for all land reform in the country. It also placed the Philippine Commission on Urban Poor (PCUP) under its supervision and control. Recognition of the ownership of ancestral domain by indigenous peoples also became the responsibility of this new department, under the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/eo_no364.htm Executiver Order No. 364]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 2005, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Executive Order No. 456 and renamed the Department of Land Reform back to Department of Agrarian Reform, since "the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law goes beyond just land reform but includes the totality of all factors and support services designed to lift the economic status of the beneficiaries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/eo_no456.htm Executive Order No. 456]&lt;/ref&gt;

When President [[Noynoy Aquino]] took office, there was a renewed push to compete the [[agrarian reform]].  The Department of Agrarian Reform adopted a goal of distributed all CARP-eligible land by the end of Pres. Aquino's term in 2016.&lt;ref name=Inquirer2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Yap|first=DJ|title=4 haciendas distributed; 270 sugar farmers cheer|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/435005/4-haciendas-distributed-270-sugar-farmers-cheer|accessdate=29 June 2013|newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2013, 694,181 [[hectares]] remained to be distributed, according to DAR.&lt;ref name=Inquirer2013 /&gt;

[[Hacienda Luisita]], owned by the [[Cojuangco]] family, which includes the late former President [[Corazon Aquino|Corazón C. Aquino]] and her son, current President Aquino, has been a notable case of land reform.&lt;ref&gt;It is notable enough to have its own Wikipedia article.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program==
{{See also|Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program}}
The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program is the current law under which land reform is conducted.  Large land-holdings are broken up and distributed to farmers and workers on that particular hacienda.  The crops grown on such haciendas include sugar and rice.  Each farmer is giving a "certificates of land ownership award" or CLOA for their new property.&lt;ref name=Inquirer2013 /&gt; Under the law, a landowner can only retain 5 hectares, regardless of the size of the hacienda.&lt;ref name=Inquirer2013 /&gt; Conflict can arise between previous landowners and "beneficiaries" and between competing farmers' groups that have conflicting claims.&lt;ref name=Inquirer2013 /&gt;

In December 2008, CARP expired and the following year CARPer was passed.  CARPer stands for "Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms".  CARPer expired in 2014.

[[History of homosexuality|Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships]] have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death. The following individuals received the death penalty for it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1966">A '''memory clinic''' is a dedicated medical clinic specialising in the assessment and diagnosis of [[memory disorder]]s. Memory clinics were first seen in the [[Healthcare in the United Kingdom|UK]] in the 1980s, mainly in academic research centres. There are by 2009 approximately 246 memory clinics but there are no official [[National Health Service|NHS]] figures and no specific standards or set models relating to them. The [[National Service Framework]] (NSF) for Older People stipulates that every specialist mental health service for older people should have a memory clinic (article 7.49) but it gives no specific guidelines for establishing one.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provide guidelines (CG42) which identify the recommended interventions and approaches to assessing a person who is referred to a memory service.  Other than the use of structural imagery, there is as said previously no specific direction of what methods should be used as part of the cognitive assessment. This means that clinics across the Uk differ in how they assess and the type of professionals who staff the memory service.
Assessments  are performed by mental health nurses, psychiatrists, occupational therapists and psychologists.  One fairly common tool of assessment is the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination which tests specific areas of cognition including memory, attention, orientation, language, verbal fluency and visuospatial abilities. There is also the use of a semi structured interview which gathers information about an individual's experience of memory problems, and the onset and progression of any difficulties with cognitive functioning, activities of daily living and behaviour.</text>

[[File:NASA ALTUS UAV.jpg|thumb|right|NASA's [[General Atomics ALTUS|Altus II]] UAV developed under ERAST]]
The '''Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology''', or '''ERAST''' program was a [[NASA]] program to develop cost-effective, slow-flying [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs) that can perform long-duration science missions at altitudes above 60,000 feet. The project included a number of technology development programs conducted by the joint NASA-industry ERAST Alliance. The project was formally terminated in 2003.&lt;ref name=goebel15&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/twuav_15.html |title=Goebel, Greg, "The NASA ERAST HALE UAV Program", '&amp;#39;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles'&amp;#39;, chapter 15. Exists in the public domain |publisher=Vectorsite.net |accessdate=August 7, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629142327/http://www.vectorsite.net/twuav_15.html|archive-date=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program overview==
According to NASA, "ERAST was a multiyear effort to develop the aeronautical and sensor technologies for a new family of remotely piloted aircraft intended for upper atmospheric science missions. Designed to cruise at slow speeds for long durations at altitudes of 60,000 to 100,000 ft, such aircraft could be used to collect, identify, and monitor environmental data to assess global climate change and assist in weather monitoring and forecasting. They also could serve as airborne telecommunications platforms, performing functions similar to communications satellites at a fraction of the cost of lofting a satellite into space."&lt;ref name=altusfact/&gt;

The ERAST program was sponsored by the Office of Aeronautics and Space Transportation Technology at NASA Headquarters, and was managed by NASA [[Dryden Flight Research Center]]. The NASA [[Ames Research Center]], [[Moffett Field]], California, headed the sensor technology development. The NASA [[Lewis Research Center]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and NASA [[Langley Research Center]], [[Hampton, Virginia]], contributed expertise in the areas of propulsion, structures, and systems analysis. Several small high-technology aeronautical development firms, including ALTUS developer General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., were teamed with NASA in the ERAST Alliance to work towards common goals of the program."&lt;ref name=altusfact/&gt; 
Industry partners in the ERAST Alliance included Aurora Flight Sciences, [[AeroVironment]], [[General Atomics]], [[Scaled Composites]], Thermo-Mechanical Systems, Hyperspectral Sciences, and Longitude 122 West.&lt;ref name=goebel15/&gt;

The ERAST project was one of three, large scale aeronautics industry partnerships launched by NASA Headquarters between 1992 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Research on the Implementation of the NASA Joint Sponsored Research Program and Other Innovative Mechanisms for Commercializing NASA Funded Technologies, NASA-CR-205083&lt;/ref&gt; The partnerships were based on the industry model for multi-party, R&amp;D partnerships, initially proposed for NASA Space Commercialization programs based on the US Department of Commerce's precedent established for the Semiconductor industry, Sematech.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Space Commercialization, Outreach Program Plan,SRI International Project 6569 Report to NASA, January 1984, Page 28&lt;/ref&gt; The ERAST project used the innovative Joint Sponsored Research Agreement (JSRA), adopted by NASA officials to satisfy technology commercialization policy objectives and credited by the ERAST participants as a key enabler of the technical success of the program.  The JSRA was based on NASA's Space Act Agreement Authority, which permitted flexible teaming, cost-sharing and intellectual property sharing to maximize collaboration for rapid technology development progress. The Federal contribution to ERAST was reported at $42.2 million while the private sector contribution was reported at $30,000 along with in-kind contributions of personnel, equipment and background intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;JSRA Agreements Summary Report to NASA, February 18, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The ERAST JSRA was one of three aeronautics partnership agreements designed by American Technology Alliances (AmTech).  AmTech served as the ERAST facilitator and partnership manager for the duration of the project.

The types of science mission ERAST prepares for can include remote sensing for Earth sciences studies, hyperspectral imaging for agriculture monitoring, tracking of severe storms, and serving as telecommunications relay platforms.&lt;ref name=altusfact/&gt;

A parallel effort headed by Ames developed lightweight, microminiaturized sensors that can be carried by these aircraft for environmental research and Earth monitoring.

Additional technologies considered by the ERAST Alliance include lightweight materials, avionics, aerodynamics, and other forms of propulsion suitable for extreme altitudes and duration.

Although ERAST Alliance members were responsible for aircraft development and operation, NASA had primary responsibility for overall program leadership, major funding, individual project management, development and coordination of payloads. NASA also worked on long-term issues with the Federal Aviation Administration and developed technology to make operation of these remotely operated aircraft in [[national airspace]] practical.

==History==
In 1987 and 1988, NASA conducted atmospheric ozone-layer depletion studies using two piloted NASA aircraft, a modified [[Douglas DC-8]] jetliner and a [[Lockheed ER-2]], a civilian version of the U-2 spy plane. However, operating the ER-2 over [[Antarctica]], where [[ozone]] depletion took place, was regarded as risky, since if the pilot had to bail out, survival was unlikely. In addition, the ER-2 had a ceiling of 20 kilometers (65,000 feet), while ozone depletion takes place at 30 kilometers (100,000 feet), and the ER-2 could not stay aloft long enough to study ozone changes during a full day-night cycle.&lt;ref name=goebel15/&gt;

In 1988, NASA decided to obtain a HALE UAV named "Perseus" to deal with these problems, designating the effort the Small High-Altitude Science Aircraft (SHASA) program. Perseus was designed by a startup company named [[Aurora flight sciences|Aurora Flight Sciences]] of [[Manassas, Virginia]]. The Perseus design effort struggled along on skimpy funds until 1991, when NASA was conducting a "High Speed Research Program" to evaluate designs for a future supersonic transport, and needed to learn more about the possible environmental impact of such an aircraft on the upper atmosphere. Funds became available to procure a few aircraft.&lt;ref name=goebel15/&gt;

Other government agencies were also interested in HALE UAVs, and so the ERAST effort was born in September 1994 as a high-profile item in NASA'a agenda. ERAST was formally intended to promote the use of UAVs in commercial science applications, particularly high-altitude atmospheric research. ERAST also has focused on development of new miniaturized sensor and avionics systems for the UAVs and for NASA's Lockheed ER-2.&lt;ref name=goebel15/&gt;

==Project components and programs==

===Aircraft===

====ALTUS====
[[Image:EC99-45006-1.jpg|thumb|right]]The [[General Atomics ALTUS|General Atomics ALTUS II]] is a civilian variant of the [[MQ-1 Predator]] UAV designed for scientific research missions. One of the two ALTUS aircraft, ALTUS II, was built under the ERAST program and has participated in a number of the related research missions.&lt;ref name=altusfact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-058-DFRC.html |title=NASA Altus II fact sheet |publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALTUS II made its first flight on May 1, 1996. With its engine at first augmented by a single-stage turbocharger, the ALTUS II reached an altitude of 37,000&amp;nbsp;ft during its first series of development flights at Dryden in August, 1996. In October of that year, the ALTUS II was flown in an [[Atmospheric Radiation Measurement]] (ARM-UAV) study in Oklahoma conducted by [[Sandia National Laboratories]] for the Department of Energy. During the course of those flights, the ALTUS II set a single-flight endurance record for remotely operated aircraft of more than 26 hours. In October 1996, ALTUS II set an endurance record for UAVs carrying science payloads. The vehicle spent more than 24 hours at the required altitude during an ARM-UAV.

After major modifications and upgrades, including installation of a two-stage turbocharger in place of its original single-stage unit, a larger fuel tank and additional intercooling capacity, the ALTUS II returned to flight status in the summer of 1998. The goal of its development test flights was to reach one of the major ERAST Level 2 performance milestones, to fly a gasoline-fueled, piston-engine remotely piloted aircraft for several hours at an altitude at or near 60,000 feet. On March 5, 1999, The ALTUS II maintained flight at or above 55,000 feet for three hours, reaching a maximum density altitude of 57,300 feet during the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/history/pastprojects/Erast/altus.html |title=NASA Altus I page |publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pathfinder, Centurion, and Helios====
[[Image:Helios in flight.jpg|thumb|right|Helios UAV in flight]]The [[NASA Pathfinder]], [[NASA Centurion|Centurion]], and [[Helios Prototype|Helios]] aircraft were a series of [[Solar energy|solar]]- and [[fuel cell]] [[system]]-powered UAVs, which [[AeroVironment|AeroVironment, Inc.]] developed the vehicle under the ERAST program.&lt;ref name=pathfinderfact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-068-DFRC.html |title=NASA Pathfinder fact sheet |publisher=NASA |accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathfinder, which was designed and built by [[AeroVironment]], is essentially a [[flying wing]] with a 99-foot span. Solar [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic cells]] mounted on the top of the wing produce up to 7,200 watts, powering the aircraft's six electric-driven propellers, as well as the suite of scientific instruments. Backup batteries store solar energy to power the aircraft at night.&lt;ref name=sd1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1997/11/971104063340.htm |title=NASA's Solar-Powered Aircraft Begins Science Missions In Hawaii |publisher=[[Science Daily]] |date=November 4, 1997 |accessdate=September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensors and instruments===

====ARTIS camera====
A small Airborne Real-Time Imaging System (ARTIS) camera, developed by HyperSpectral Sciences, Inc., under ERAST project, was flight demonstrated during the summer of 1999 on board the [[Scaled Composites Proteus]] aircraft when it took visual and near-[[infrared]] photos from Proteus while it was flying high over the [[Experimental Aircraft Association]]'s [[Oshkosh Airshow|AirVenture 99]] Airshow at [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]]. The images were displayed on a computer monitor at the show only moments after they were taken.

====DASI====
The Digital Array Scanned [[Interferometer]] (DASI) was operated from the Pathfinder in the summer of 1997, acquiring imaging interferometric data of the Hawaiian Islands. The DASI, which originated at [[Washington University]] and was jointly developed with Ames Research Center, had to meet the stringent engineering and operating requirements of the Pathfinder with respect to remote operation, very light weight, and low volume, power and bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/dasi/dasipath.html |title="The use of DASI in the ERAST/Pathfinder Science Project", NASA fact sheet |publisher=Geo.arc.nasa.gov |accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/ERAST/pathfinder/previousmissions.html |title=Highlights from the DASI Pathfinder Mission, NASA, October 1997, archived at archive.org |publisher=[[Web.archive.org]] |date=March 12, 2007 |accessdate=August 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312111332/http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/ERAST/pathfinder/previousmissions.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====DSA====
In March 2002, NASA Dryden, in cooperation with [[New Mexico State University]]'s Technical Analysis and Applications Center (TAAC), the FAA and several other entities, conducted flight demonstrations of an active detect, see and avoid ('''DSA''') system for potential application to UAVs at [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. The [[Scaled Composites Proteus]] aircraft was flown as a surrogate UAV controlled remotely from the ground, although safety pilots were aboard to handle takeoff and landing and any potential emergencies. Three other aircraft, ranging from general aviation aircraft to a NASA [[F/A-18]], served as "cooperative" target aircraft with an operating transponder. In each of 18 different scenarios, a [[Goodrich Corporation|Goodrich]] Skywatch HP Traffic Advisory System (TAS) on the Proteus detected approaching air traffic on potential collision courses, including several scenarios with two aircraft approaching from different directions. The remote pilot then directed Proteus to turn, climb or descend as needed to avoid the potential threat.

In April 2003, a second series of flight demonstrations focusing on "non-cooperative" aircraft (those without operating transponders), was conducted in restricted airspace near [[Mojave, California]]., again using the Proteus as a surrogate UAV. Proteus was equipped with a small Amphitech OASys 35&amp;nbsp;GHz primary radar system to detect potential intruder aircraft on simulated collision courses. The radar data was telemetered directly to the ground station as well as via an [[International Mobile Satellite Organization|Inmarsat]] satellite system installed on Proteus. A mix of seven intruder aircraft, ranging from a [[sailplane]] to a high-speed jet, flew 20 scenarios over a four-day period, one or two aircraft at a time. In each case, the radar picked up the intruding aircraft at ranges from 2.5 to 6.5 miles, depending on the intruder's radar signature. Proteus' remote pilot on the ground was able to direct Proteus to take evasive action if needed.

The '''National Agricultural Policy Center (NAPC)''' ({{lang-ar|المركز الوطني للسياسات الزراعية}}), was established in 2000 through the work of the Project GCP/SYR/006/ITA&lt;ref name="fao.org"&gt;http://www.fao.org/world/syria/gcpita/&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[FAO|Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)]] of the [[United Nations]], funded by the Government of Italy, to be part of the Syrian [[Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (Syria)|Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agri.gov.sy&lt;/ref&gt; The project is now in its third phase. It is a center of research and analysis in the field of agricultural policies in [[Syria]], and therefore strives to provide policy analysis for relevant stakeholders and policymakers in the field.

== History ==
[[Image:NAPC group.JPG|thumb|right|300px|NAPC and Project Staff at the NAPC Premises in 2007]]
The [[FAO]] Project GCP/SYR/006/ITA&lt;ref name="fao.org"/&gt; started in April 1998, and sought to respond to the Government of Syria's initiative to move from a socially [[planned economy]] to a [[social market economy]]. After background work and training from the Project the NAPC was established in 2000 as part of the Project's first phase (April 1998 - October 2001). In the second phase (November 2001 - October 2004) of the Project extensive training was delivered to the now fully staffed NAPC, an organizational structure was developed and a mid-term work-plan established. In third phase (November 2004 - October 2007), the Project assisted in consolidating the work of the NAPC with a view to its future independence and sustainability.

== Establishment Aims ==
To meet the long as well as short-term needs of decision-makers for in-depth and rigorous analysis for policy options on issues of relevance. Including:
* undertaking policy analysis studies enabling the formulation of integrated, coherent and effective agricultural strategies and policies
* suggesting policy directives to help relieve and overcome agricultural problems and constraints
* preparing and publishing policy studies and reports to enable the integration of the agricultural sector within the economy
* conducting training courses with a view to helping in the capacity building in policy analysis and planning within the Syrian Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform and other related Ministries and Institutions.

== NAPC Structure and Focus Areas ==
The NAPC is divided into four different divisions, each with a specific mandate related to the subject of agricultural policy analysis in Syria. These divisions are as follows: Trade Policy (TPD), Agro-Food (AFD), Rural Development (RDD) and Information and Communications (InfoCom).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napcsyr.org/about.htm About NAPC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The focus areas of each division can be given as follows:

===Trade Policy===
*[[international trade|International Trade Agreements]]

== Publications ==
The major publications of the NAPC are the two Periodical Reports that it produces. One of which, '''Syrian Agricultural Trade (SAT)'''&lt;ref name="Periodical Reports"&gt;[http://www.napcsyr.org/pubs/periodical/reports.htm Periodical Reports&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is published annually, the other of which, '''The State of Food and Agriculture in Syria (SOFAS)'''&lt;ref name="Periodical Reports"/&gt; is biannual. These are substantial studies which give a regular overview of the situation of agriculture and agricultural trade in Syria.

In addition to these publications the NAPC regularly produces Policy Studies, Working Papers, and Policy Notes on a wide range of different issues. Furthermore, the NAPC makes available the proceedings of various seminars and workshops. All of the publications are made available through the NAPC website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napcsyr.org National Agricultural Policy Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syrian Agricultural Database (SADB)==
Is a fully disaggregated and detailed database for Syrian Agriculture based on [[FAOSTAT]] format.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.napcsyr.org/sadb.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The database is fully browseable and searchable through the NAPC website and is made available to the general public. It includes data on areas such as trade, national economic data, census, inputs and outputs, production, natural resources, fertilizers, machinery.&lt;ref name="Syrian Agriculture Database"/&gt; The SADB has been available since 2003 and is updated each year to reflect the most recent data available.

'''National Socialism''' ({{lang-de|Nationalsozialismus}}), more commonly known as '''Nazism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɑː|t|s|i|ɪ|z|əm|,_|ˈ|n|æ|t|-}}),&lt;ref name=Jones2003/&gt; is the [[ideology]] and practices associated with the [[Nazi Party]] &amp;ndash; officially the National Socialist German Workers' Party (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' or NSDAP) &amp;ndash; in [[Nazi Germany]], and of other [[Far-right politics|far-right]] groups with similar aims.

Nazism is a form of [[fascism]] and showed that ideology's disdain for [[liberal democracy]] and the [[parliamentary system]], but also incorporated fervent [[antisemitism]], [[scientific racism]], and [[eugenics]] into its creed. Its extreme [[nationalism]] came from [[Pan-Germanism]] and the [[Völkisch movement]] prominent in the [[German nationalism]] of the time, and it was strongly influenced by the [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] ''[[Freikorps]]'' [[paramilitary]] groups that emerged after Germany's defeat in [[World War I]], from which came the party's "cult of violence" which was "at the heart of the movement."&lt;ref&gt;Evans (2003), p.229&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazism subscribed to theories of [[racial hierarchy]] and [[Social Darwinism]], identifying the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an [[Aryan race|Aryan]] or [[Nordic race|Nordic]] [[master race]].&lt;ref name=Baum2006_156/&gt; It aimed to overcome social divisions and create a German homogeneous society based on racial purity which represented a people's community (''[[Volksgemeinschaft#Nazi Volksgemeinschaft|Volksgemeinschaft]]''). The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory, as well as gain additional lands for German expansion under the doctrine of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' and exclude those who they deemed either community aliens or "inferior" races.

The term "National Socialism" arose out of attempts to create a nationalist redefinition of "socialism", as an alternative to both [[Socialism|international socialism]] and [[Free market|free market capitalism]]. Nazism rejected the [[Marxism|Marxist]] concept of [[class conflict]], opposed [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the "[[common good]]", accepting political interests as the main priority of economic organization.{{r|Kobrak2004}}

The Nazi Party's precursor, the Pan-German nationalist and antisemitic [[German Workers' Party]], was founded on 5 January 1919. By the early 1920s the party was renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party &amp;ndash; to attract workers away from left-wing parties such as the [[German Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] (SPD) and the [[German Communist Party|Communists]] (KPD) &amp;ndash; and [[Adolf Hitler]] assumed control of the organization. The [[National Socialist Program]] or "25 Points" was adopted in 1920 and called for a united [[Greater Germany]] that would deny citizenship to [[Jews]] or those of Jewish descent, while also supporting land reform and the [[nationalization]] of some industries. In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' ("My Struggle"; 1924–1925), Hitler outlined the anti-Semitism and anti-Communism at the heart of his political philosophy, as well as his disdain for [[representative democracy]] and his belief in Germany's right to territorial expansion.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=243-44, 248-49}}

The Nazi Party won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] general elections of 1932, making them the largest party in the legislature by far, but still short of an outright majority. Because none of the parties were willing or able to put together a coalition government, in 1933 Hitler was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]] by President [[Paul Von Hindenburg]], through the support and connivance of traditional conservative nationalists who believed that they could control him and his party. Through the use of emergency presidential decrees by Hindenburg, and a change in the [[Weimar Constitution]] which allowed the Cabinet to rule by direct decree, bypassing both Hindenburg and the Reichstag, the Nazis had soon established a [[one-party state]].

The ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) and the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) functioned as the paramilitary organizations of the Nazi Party. Using the SS for the task, Hitler purged the party's more socially and economically radical factions in the mid-1934 [[Night of the Long Knives]], including the leadership of the SA.  After the death of President Hindenburg, political power was concentrated in Hitler's hands and he became Germany's head of state as well as the head of the government, with the title of ''[[Führer]]'', meaning "leader". From that point, Hitler was effectively the [[dictator]] of Nazi Germany, which was also known as the "Third Reich", under which Jews, political opponents and other "undesirable" elements were marginalized, imprisoned or murdered. Many millions of people were eventually exterminated in a genocide which became known as [[the Holocaust]] during [[World War II]], including around two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe.

Following Germany's defeat in World War II and the discovery of the full extent of the Holocaust, Nazi ideology became universally disgraced. It is widely regarded as immoral and [[evil]], with only a few fringe [[Racism|racist]] groups, usually referred to as [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]], describing themselves as followers of National Socialism.

==Etymology==
[[File:Flag of the NSDAP (1920–1945).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Nazi Party]], similar but not identical to the national [[flag of Germany#Nazi Germany and World War II (1933–1945)|flag of Nazi Germany]] (1933–1945), in which the [[swastika]] is slightly off-centred]]

The full name of the party was ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' ({{lang-en| National-Socialist German Workers' Party}}) for which they officially used the acronym NSDAP.

The term "Nazi" was in use before the rise of the NSDAP as a colloquial and derogatory word for a backwards farmer or [[peasant]], characterizing an awkward and clumsy person. In this sense, the word ''Nazi'' was a [[hypocorism]] of the German male name Ignatz (itself a variation of the name [[Ignatius]]) – Ignatz being a common name at the time in [[Bavaria]], the area from which the NSDAP emerged.&lt;ref name=GottliebMorgensen2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=HarperOED/&gt;

In the 1920s, political opponents of the NSDAP in the German [[labour movement]] seized on this and – using the earlier abbreviated term "Sozi" for ''Sozialist'' ({{lang-en|Socialist}}) as an example&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nazi|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Nazi|website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; – shortened the first part of the NSDAP's name, ''[Na]tionalso[zi]alistische'', to the dismissive "Nazi", in order to associate them with the derogatory use of the term mentioned above.&lt;ref name=Lepage2009_9/&gt;&lt;ref name=HarperOED/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sourcebook/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyTelegraph23102011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seebold2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Nazi.'' In: Friedrich Kluge, Elmar Seebold: ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache.'' 24. Auflage, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 2002, {{ISBN|3-11-017473-1}} ([http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Nazi Online Etymology Dictionary: ''Nazi'']).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the NSDAP's rise to power in the 1930s, the use of the term "Nazi" by itself or in terms such as "[[Nazi Germany]]", "[[Nazi regime]]" and so on was popularised by German exiles. From them, the term spread into other languages and it was eventually brought back into Germany after World War II.&lt;ref name=Sourcebook/&gt;

The NSDAP briefly adopted the designation "Nazi"{{when|date=August 2017}} in an attempt to [[reappropriate]] the term, but it soon gave up this effort and generally avoided using the term while it was in power.&lt;ref name=Sourcebook/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyTelegraph23102011/&gt;

==Position within the political spectrum==

The majority of scholars identify Nazism in both theory and practice as a form of [[far-right politics]].&lt;ref name=Fritzsche_Eatwell_Griffin/&gt; Far-right themes in Nazism include the argument that superior people have a right to dominate other people and purge society of supposed inferior elements.&lt;ref name="Oliver H. Woshinsky 2008. p. 156"/&gt; Adolf Hitler and other proponents denied that Nazism was either left-wing or right-wing, instead they officially portrayed Nazism as a [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]] movement.&lt;ref name="Adolf Hitler p. 170"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudy Koshar 1986. p. 190"/&gt; In ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler directly attacked both left-wing and right-wing politics in Germany, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today our left-wing politicians in particular are constantly insisting that their craven-hearted and obsequious foreign policy necessarily results from the disarmament of Germany, whereas the truth is that this is the policy of traitors ... But the politicians of the Right deserve exactly the same reproach. It was through their miserable cowardice that those ruffians of Jews who came into power in 1918 were able to rob the nation of its arms.&lt;ref name="Adolf Hitler 2010. p. 287"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a speech given in Munich on 12 April 1922, Hitler stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are only two possibilities in Germany; do not imagine that the people will forever go with the middle party, the party of compromises; one day it will turn to those who have most consistently foretold the coming ruin and have sought to dissociate themselves from it. And that party is either the Left: and then God help us! for it will lead us to complete destruction - to Bolshevism, or else it is a party of the Right which at the last, when the people is in utter despair, when it has lost all its spirit and has no longer any faith in anything, is determined for its part ruthlessly to seize the reins of power - that is the beginning of resistance of which I spoke a few minutes ago.&lt;ref name="holocaustreader"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When asked{{when|date=November 2017}} whether he supported the "bourgeois right-wing", Hitler claimed that Nazism was not exclusively for any class and he indicated that it favoured neither the left nor the right, but preserved "pure" elements from both "camps" by stating: "From the camp of bourgeois [[tradition]], it takes national resolve, and from the [[Dialectical materialism|materialism]] of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] dogma, living, creative Socialism".&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt;

Historians regard the equation of National Socialism as 'Hitlerism' as too simplistic since the term was used prior to the rise of Hitler and the Nazis and the different ideologies incorporated into Nazism were already well established in certain parts of German society before [[World War I]].{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=135}} The Nazis were strongly influenced by the post–World War I far-right in Germany, which held common beliefs such as anti-Marxism, anti-liberalism and antisemitism, along with [[nationalism]], contempt for the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and condemnation of the Weimar Republic for signing the armistice in November 1918 which later led it to sign the Treaty of Versailles.&lt;ref name="Peukert, Detlev 1993 pp. 73-74"/&gt; A major inspiration for the Nazis were the far-right nationalist ''[[Freikorps#Post-World War I|Freikorps]]'', paramilitary organizations that engaged in political violence after World War I.&lt;ref name="Peukert, Detlev 1993 pp. 73-74"/&gt; Initially, the post–World War I German far-right was dominated by [[Monarchism|monarchists]], but the younger generation, which was associated with ''Völkisch'' nationalism, was more radical and it did not express any emphasis on the restoration of the German monarchy.&lt;ref name="Peukert, Detlev 1993 p. 74"/&gt; This younger generation desired to dismantle the Weimar Republic and create a new radical and strong state based upon a martial ruling ethic that could revive the "Spirit of 1914" which was associated with German national unity (''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'').&lt;ref name="Peukert, Detlev 1993 p. 74"/&gt;

The Nazis, the far-right monarchists, the [[reactionary]] [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) and others, such as monarchist officers in the German Army and several prominent industrialists, formed an alliance in opposition to the Weimar Republic on 11 October 1931 in [[Bad Harzburg]], officially known as the "National Front", but commonly referred to as the [[Harzburg Front]].&lt;ref name="machtergreifung"/&gt; The Nazis stated that the alliance was purely tactical and they continued to have differences with the DNVP. The Nazis described the DNVP as a bourgeois party and they called themselves an anti-bourgeois party.&lt;ref name="machtergreifung"/&gt; After the elections of July 1932, the alliance broke down when the DNVP lost many of its seats in the Reichstag. The Nazis denounced them as "an insignificant heap of reactionaries".&lt;ref name="machtergreifung5"/&gt; The DNVP responded by denouncing the Nazis for their socialism, their street violence and the "economic experiments" that would take place if the Nazis ever rose to power.&lt;ref name="machtergreifung6"/&gt; But amidst an inconclusive political situation in which conservative politicians [[Franz von Papen]] and [[Kurt von Schleicher]] were unable to form stable governments without the Nazis, Papen proposed to President Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as Chancellor at the head of a government formed primarily of conservatives, with only three Nazi ministers.{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=104-106}}&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee. ''European Dictatorships, 1918-1945.'' Routledge, 1987. p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Hindenburg did so, and contrary to the expectations of Papen and the DNVP, Hitler was soon able to establish a Nazi one-party dictatorship.{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=106-107}}

[[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], who was pressured to abdicate the throne and flee into exile amidst an attempted communist revolution in Germany, initially supported the Nazi Party. His four sons, including Prince [[Prince Eitel Friedrich of Prussia|Eitel Friedrich]] and Prince [[Prince Oskar of Prussia|Oskar]], became members of the Nazi Party in hopes that in exchange for their support, the Nazis would permit the restoration of the monarchy.&lt;ref name="nicholas"/&gt;

There were factions within the Nazi Party, both conservative and radical.&lt;ref name="Michael Mann 2004. p. 183"/&gt; The conservative Nazi [[Hermann Göring]] urged Hitler to conciliate with [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Reactionary|reactionaries]].&lt;ref name="Michael Mann 2004. p. 183" /&gt; Other prominent conservative Nazis included [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Reinhard Heydrich]].&lt;ref name="foundations"/&gt; Meanwhile, the radical Nazi [[Joseph Goebbels]] opposed capitalism, viewing it as having Jews at its core and he stressed the need for the party to emphasize both a [[Proletariat|proletarian]] and a national character. Those views were shared by [[Otto Strasser]], who later left the Nazi Party in the belief that Hitler had allegedly betrayed the party's socialist goals by endorsing capitalism.&lt;ref name="Michael Mann 2004. p. 183"/&gt;

When the Nazi Party emerged from obscurity to become a major political force after 1929, the conservative faction rapidly gained more influence, as wealthy donors took an interest in the Nazis as a potential bulwark against communism.&lt;ref&gt;Hallgarten, George (1973). "The Collusion of Capitalism". In Snell, John L. (ed.). "The Nazi Revolution: Hitler's Dictatorship and the German Nation". D. C. Heath and Company. pp. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi Party had previously been financed almost entirely from membership dues, but after 1929 its leadership began actively seeking donations from German industrialists, and Hitler began holding dozens of fundraising meetings with business leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Hallgarten, George (1973). "The Collusion of Capitalism". In Snell, John L. (ed.). "The Nazi Revolution: Hitler's Dictatorship and the German Nation". D. C. Heath and Company. pp. 133&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of the Great Depression, facing the possibility of economic ruin on the one hand and a Communist or Social Democratic government on the other hand, German business increasingly turned to Nazism as offering a way out of the situation, by promising a state-driven economy that would support, rather than attack, existing business interests.&lt;ref&gt;Hallgarten, George (1973). "The Collusion of Capitalism". In Snell, John L. (ed.). "The Nazi Revolution: Hitler's Dictatorship and the German Nation". D. C. Heath and Company. pp. 137, 142&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1933, the Nazi Party had secured the support of important sectors of German industry, mainly among the steel and coal producers, the insurance business and the chemical industry.&lt;ref&gt;Hallgarten, George (1973).

Large segments of the Nazi Party, particularly among the members of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), were committed to the party's official socialist, revolutionary and [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] positions and expected both a social and an economic revolution when the party gained power in 1933.&lt;ref name="Joseph W. Bendersky 2007. p. 96"/&gt; In the period immediately before the Nazi seizure of power, there were even [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] who switched sides and became known as "[[Beefsteak Nazi]]s": brown on the outside and red inside.&lt;ref&gt;Heiden, Konrad (1938) ''Hitler: A Biography'', London: Constable &amp; Co. Ltd. p.390&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the SA, [[Ernst Röhm]], pushed for a "second revolution" (the "first revolution" being the Nazis' seizure of power) that would enact socialist policies. Furthermore, Röhm desired that the SA absorb the much smaller German Army into its ranks under his leadership.&lt;ref name="Joseph W. Bendersky 2007. p. 96"/&gt; Once the Nazis achieved power, Röhm's SA was directed by Hitler to violently suppress the parties of the left, but they also began attacks against individuals deemed to be associated with conservative reaction.{{sfn|Nyomarkay|1967|p=123-124;130}} Hitler saw Röhm's independent actions as violating and possibly threatening his leadership, as well as jeopardising the regime by alienating the conservative President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and the conservative-oriented German Army.&lt;ref name=Nyomarkay1967_133/&gt; This resulted in Hitler purging Röhm and other radical members of the SA in 1934, in what came to be known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]].&lt;ref name=Nyomarkay1967_133/&gt;

Before he joined the Bavarian Army to fight in [[World War I]], Hitler had lived a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle as a petty street watercolour artist in [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]] and he maintained elements of this lifestyle later on, going to bed very late and rising in the afternoon, even after he became Chancellor and then Führer.&lt;ref name="publishers"/&gt; After the war, his battalion was absorbed by the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] from 1918 to 1919, where he was elected Deputy Battalion Representative. According to historian Thomas Weber, Hitler attended the funeral of communist [[Kurt Eisner]] (a German Jew), wearing a black mourning armband on one arm and a red communist armband on the other,&lt;ref name="Thomas Weber 2011. p. 251"/&gt; which he took as evidence that Hitler's political beliefs had not yet solidified.&lt;ref name="Thomas Weber 2011. p. 251"/&gt; In ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler never mentioned any service with the Bavarian Soviet Republic and he stated that he became an antisemite in 1913 during his years in Vienna. This statement has been disputed by the contention that he was not an antisemite at that time,&lt;ref name="Jeffrey S. Gaab 2008. p. 61"/&gt; even though it is well established that he read many antisemitic tracts and journals during time and admired [[Karl Lueger]], the antisemitic mayor of Vienna.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pages=34-35, 50-52, 60-67}} Hitler altered his political views in response to the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919 and it was then that he became an antisemitic, German nationalist.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey S. Gaab 2008. p. 61"/&gt;

Hitler expressed opposition to capitalism, regarding it as having Jewish origins and accusing capitalism of holding nations ransom to the interests of a parasitic [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] [[Rentier capitalism|rentier]] class.&lt;ref name="R.J. Overy 2004. pp. 399-403"/&gt; He also expressed opposition to communism and egalitarian forms of socialism, arguing that inequality and hierarchy are beneficial to the nation.{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=49}} He believed that communism was invented by the Jews to weaken nations by promoting class struggle.{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=50}} After his rise to power, Hitler took a pragmatic position on economics, accepting private property and allowing capitalist private enterprises to exist so long as they adhered to the goals of the Nazi state, but not tolerating enterprises that he saw as being opposed to the national interest.&lt;ref name="Michael Mann 2004. p. 183"/&gt;

German business leaders disliked Nazi ideology but came to support Hitler, because they saw the Nazis as a useful ally to promote their interests.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=101}} Business groups made significant financial contributions to the Nazi Party both before and after the Nazi seizure of power, in the hope that a Nazi dictatorship would eliminate the organized labour movement and the left-wing parties.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=100-101}} Hitler actively sought to gain the support of business leaders by arguing that private enterprise is incompatible with democracy.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=99}}

Although he opposed communist ideology, Hitler publicly praised the [[Soviet Union]]'s leader [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Stalinism]] on numerous occasions.&lt;ref name="François Furet 1999. pp. 191-192"/&gt; Hitler commended Stalin for seeking to purify the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] of Jewish influences, noting Stalin's purging of Jewish communists such as [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Karl Radek]].&lt;ref name="communism"/&gt; While Hitler had always intended to bring Germany into conflict with the Soviet Union so he could gain ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space"), he supported a temporary strategic alliance between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union to form a common anti-liberal front so they could defeat liberal democracies, particularly [[France]].&lt;ref name="François Furet 1999. pp. 191-192"/&gt;

===Völkisch nationalism===
{{Main|Pan-Germanism|German nationalism|German Question|Unification of Germany|Völkisch movement}}
[[File:Johann Gottlieb Fichte.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], considered one of the fathers of German nationalism]]

One of the most significant ideological influences on the Nazis was the German nationalist [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], whose works had served as an inspiration to Hitler and other Nazi Party members, including [[Dietrich Eckart]] and [[Arnold Fanck]].&lt;ref name=Ryback2010/&gt; In ''Speeches to the German Nation'' (1808), written amid [[Napoleon]]ic France's occupation of Berlin, Fichte called for a German national revolution against the French occupiers, making passionate public speeches, arming his students for battle against the French and stressing the need for action by the German nation so it could free itself.&lt;ref name=Ryback2010_129/&gt; Fichte's nationalism was populist and opposed to traditional elites, spoke of the need for a "People's War" (''Volkskrieg'') and put forth concepts similar to those which the Nazis adopted.&lt;ref name=Ryback2010_129/&gt; Fichte promoted German [[exceptionalism]] and stressed the need for the German nation to purify itself (including purging the German language of French words, a policy that the Nazis undertook upon their rise to power).&lt;ref name=Ryback2010_129/&gt;

Another important figure in pre-Nazi ''völkisch'' thinking was [[Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl]], whose work—''Land und Leute'' (''Land and People'', written between 1857 and 1863)—collectively tied the organic German Volk to its native landscape and nature, a pairing which stood in stark opposition to the mechanical and materialistic civilization which was then developing as a result of [[industrialization]].&lt;ref&gt;George L. Mosse, ''The Crisis of German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich'' (New York: Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1964), pp. 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Geographers [[Friedrich Ratzel]] and [[Karl Haushofer]] borrowed from Riehl's work as did Nazi ideologues Alfred Rosenberg and Paul Schultze-Naumburg, both of whom employed some of Riehl's philosophy in arguing that "each nation-state was an organism that required a particular living space in order to survive".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lekan and Thomas Zeller, "Introduction: The Landscape of German Environmental History," in ''Germany's Nature: Cultural Landscapes and Environmental History'', edited by Thomas Lekan and Thomas Zeller (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2005), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Riehl's influence is overtly discernible in the ''[[Blut und Boden]]'' (''Blood and Soil'') philosophy introduced by [[Oswald Spengler]], which the Nazi agriculturalist Walther Darré and other prominent Nazis adopted.&lt;ref&gt;The Nazi concept of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' has connections with this idea, with German farmers being rooted to their soil, needing more of it for the expansion of the German Volk - whereas the Jew is precisely the opposite, nomadic and urban by nature. See: Roderick Stackelberg, ''The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany'' (New York: Routledge, 2007), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Additional evidence of Riehl's legacy can be seen in the Riehl Prize, ''Die Volkskunde als Wissenschaft'' (Folklore as Science) which was awarded in 1935 by the Nazis. See: George L. Mosse, ''The Crisis of German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich'' (New York: Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1964), p. 23. Applicants for the Riehl prize had stipulations that included only being of Aryan blood, and no evidence of membership in any Marxist parties or any organisation that stood against National Socialism. See: Hermann Stroback, "Folklore and Fascism before and around 1933," in ''The Nazification of an Academic Discipline: Folklore in the Third Reich'', edited by James R Dow and Hannjost Lixfeld (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994), pp. 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Völkisch'' nationalism denounced soulless [[materialism]], [[individualism]] and [[Secularization|secularised]] [[Urban area|urban]] industrial society, while advocating a "superior" society based on ethnic German "folk" culture and German "blood".&lt;ref name="encyclopedia7" /&gt; It denounced foreigners and foreign ideas and declared that Jews, [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] and others were "traitors to the nation" and unworthy of inclusion.&lt;ref name="constructing"/&gt; ''Völkisch'' nationalism saw the world in terms of [[natural law]] and [[romanticism]] and it viewed societies as organic, extolling the virtues of [[rural]] life, condemning the neglect of tradition and the decay of morals, denounced the destruction of the natural environment and condemned "cosmopolitan" cultures such as Jews and Romani.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Olsen 1999. p. 62"/&gt;

The first party that attempted to combine nationalism and socialism was the [[German Workers' Party (Austria-Hungary)|(Austria-Hungary) German Workers' Party]], which predominantly aimed to solve the conflict between the Austrian Germans and the Czechs in the multi-ethnic [[Austrian Empire]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gladding Whiteside, Austrian National Socialism before 1918, (1962), pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 the German politician Friedrich Naumann formed the National-Social Association which aimed to combine German nationalism and a non-Marxist form of socialism together; the attempt turned out to be futile and the idea of linking nationalism with socialism quickly became equated with antisemites, extreme German nationalists and the ''Völkisch'' movement in general.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=135}}

[[File:VonSchoenerer.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Georg Ritter von Schönerer]], a major exponent of Pan-Germanism]]

During the era of [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]], ''Völkisch'' nationalism was overshadowed by both Prussian patriotism and the federalist tradition of its various component states.&lt;ref name="Nina Witoszek 2002. pp. 89-90"/&gt; The events of World War I, including the end of the Prussian monarchy in Germany, resulted in a surge of revolutionary ''Völkisch'' nationalism.&lt;ref name="witoszek"/&gt; The Nazis supported such revolutionary ''Völkisch'' nationalist policies&lt;ref name="Nina Witoszek 2002. pp. 89-90"/&gt; and they claimed that their ideology was influenced by the leadership and policies of [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]], the founder of the [[German Empire]].&lt;ref name=Gerwarth2007/&gt; The Nazis declared that they were dedicated to continuing the process of creating a unified German [[nation state]] that Bismarck had begun and desired to achieve.&lt;ref name=Gerwarth2007_149/&gt; While Hitler was supportive of Bismarck's creation of the German Empire, he was critical of Bismarck's moderate domestic policies.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2007|p=54}} On the issue of Bismarck's support of a ''[[Kleindeutschland]]'' ("Lesser Germany", excluding Austria) versus the Pan-German ''[[German question#Later influence|Großdeutschland]]'' ("Greater Germany") which the Nazis advocated, Hitler stated that Bismarck's attainment of ''Kleindeutschland'' was the "highest achievement" Bismarck could have achieved "within the limits possible at that time".&lt;ref name=Gerwarth2007_131/&gt; In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (''My Struggle''), Hitler presented himself as a "second Bismarck".&lt;ref name=Gerwarth2007_131/&gt;

During his youth in Austria, Hitler was politically influenced by Austrian Pan-Germanist proponent [[Georg Ritter von Schönerer]], who advocated radical [[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalism]], antisemitism, [[anti-Catholicism]], [[anti-Slavic sentiment]] and anti-Habsburg views.&lt;ref name="nicholls236237"/&gt; From von Schönerer and his followers, Hitler adopted for the Nazi movement the ''Heil'' greeting, the ''Führer'' title and the model of absolute party leadership.&lt;ref name="nicholls236237"/&gt; Hitler was also impressed by the [[Populism|populist]] antisemitism and the anti-liberal bourgeois agitation of [[Karl Lueger]], who as the mayor of Vienna during Hitler's time in the city used a rabble-rousing style of oratory that appealed to the wider masses.&lt;ref name="nicholls159160"/&gt; Unlike von Schönerer, Lueger was not a German nationalist and instead was a pro-Catholic Habsburg supporter and only used German nationalist notions occasionally for his own agenda.&lt;ref name="nicholls159160"/&gt; Although Hitler praised both Lueger and Schönerer, he criticized the former for not applying a racial doctrine against the Jews and Slavs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brigitte Hamann|title=Hitler's Vienna: A Portrait of the Tyrant as a Young Man|year=2010|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|isbn=978-1-84885-277-8|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial theories and antisemitism===
{{Main|Nazism and race}}
[[File:Arthur de Gobineau.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Arthur de Gobineau]], one of the key inventors of the theory of the "[[Aryan race]]"]]

The concept of the [[Aryan race]], which the Nazis promoted, stems from racial theories asserting that Europeans are the descendants of Indo-Iranian settlers, people of ancient [[India]] and ancient [[Iran|Persia]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; Proponents of this theory based their assertion on the fact that words in European languages and words in Indo-Iranian languages have similar pronunciations and meanings.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] argued that the Germanic peoples held close racial connections to the ancient Indians and the ancient Persians, who he claimed were advanced peoples that possessed a great capacity for wisdom, nobility, restraint and science.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6/&gt; Contemporaries of Herder used the concept of the Aryan race to draw a distinction between what they deemed to be "high and noble" Aryan culture versus that of "parasitic" Semitic culture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6/&gt;

Notions of [[white supremacy]] and Aryan racial superiority were combined in the 19th century, with white supremacists maintaining the belief that certain groups of [[white people]] were members of an Aryan "master race" that is superior to other races and particularly superior to the Semitic race, which they associated with "cultural sterility".&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; [[Arthur de Gobineau]], a French racial theorist and aristocrat, blamed the fall of the ''[[ancien régime]]'' in [[France]] on racial degeneracy caused by [[Miscegenation|racial intermixing]], which he argued had destroyed the purity of the Aryan race, a term which he only reserved for Germanic people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Tacitus'', p. 294. A. J. Woodman - 2009 "The white race was defined as beautiful, honourable and destined to rule; within it the Aryans are '{{lang|fr|cette illustre famille humaine, la plus noble}}'." Originally a linguistic term synonymous with Indo-European, '[[Aryan]]' became, not least because of the Essai, the designation of a race, which Gobineau specified was 'la race germanique'&lt;/ref&gt; Gobineau's theories, which attracted a strong following in Germany,&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; emphasized the existence of an irreconcilable [[polarity in international relations|polarity]] between Aryan ([[Germanic culture|Germanic]]) and [[Jewish culture]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1600-06, Houston Stewart Chamberlain.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], whose book ''The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century'' would prove to be a seminal work in the history of German nationalism]]

Aryan [[mysticism]] claimed that [[Christianity]] originated in Aryan religious traditions, and that Jews had usurped the legend from Aryans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], an English proponent of racial theory, supported notions of Germanic supremacy and antisemitism in Germany.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt; Chamberlain's work, ''[[The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century]]'' (1899), praised Germanic peoples for their creativity and idealism while asserting that the Germanic spirit was threatened by a "Jewish" spirit of selfishness and [[materialism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; Chamberlain used his thesis to promote [[Monarchism|monarchical]] [[conservatism]] while denouncing [[democracy]], [[liberalism]] and [[socialism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; The book became popular, especially in Germany.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; Chamberlain stressed a nation's need to maintain its racial purity in order to prevent its degeneration and argued that racial intermingling with Jews should never be permitted.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; In 1923, Chamberlain met Hitler, whom he admired as a leader of the rebirth of the free spirit.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia9"/&gt; [[Madison Grant]]'s work ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916) advocated [[Nordicism]] and proposed that a [[eugenics]] program should be implemented in order to preserve the purity of the Nordic race. After reading the book, Hitler called it "my Bible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stefan Kühl|title=Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195149785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the belief that Jews were economically exploiting Germans became prominent due to the ascendancy of many wealthy Jews into prominent positions upon the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871.&lt;ref name="Brustein207"&gt;William Brustein. ''Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust''. Cambridge University Press, 2003. P. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1871 to the early 20th century, German Jews were overrepresented in Germany's upper and middle classes while they were underrepresented in Germany's lower classes, particularly in the fields of agricultural and industrial labour.&lt;ref name="Brustein210"/&gt; German Jewish financiers and bankers played a key role in fostering Germany's economic growth from 1871 to 1913 and they benefited enormously from this boom. In 1908, amongst the twenty-nine wealthiest German families with aggregate fortunes of up to 55 million marks at the time, five were Jewish and the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]] were the second wealthiest German family.&lt;ref&gt;William Brustein. ''Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust''. Cambridge University Press, 2003. P. 207, 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The predominance of Jews in Germany's banking, commerce and industry sectors during this time period was very high, even though Jews were estimated to account for only 1% of the population of Germany.&lt;ref name="Brustein207"/&gt; The overrepresentation of Jews in these areas fueled resentment among non-Jewish Germans during periods of economic crisis.&lt;ref name="Brustein210"&gt;Brustein, 2003, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1873 stock market crash and the ensuing depression resulted in a spate of attacks on alleged Jewish economic dominance in Germany and antisemitism increased.&lt;ref name="Brustein210" /&gt; During this time period, in the 1870s, German [[Völkisch movement|''Völkisch'' nationalism]] began to adopt antisemitic and racist themes and it was also adopted by a number of radical right political movements.&lt;ref name="witoszek10" /&gt;

Radical Antisemitism was promoted by prominent advocates of ''Völkisch'' nationalism, including [[Eugen Diederichs]], [[Paul de Lagarde]] and [[Julius Langbehn]].&lt;ref name="Jonathan Olsen 1999. p. 62"/&gt; De Lagarde called the Jews a "[[bacillus]], the carriers of decay ... who pollute every national culture ... and destroy all faiths with their materialistic liberalism" and he called for the extermination of the Jews.&lt;ref name="Jack Fischel 1998. p. 5"/&gt; Langbehn called for a war of annihilation against the Jews, and his genocidal policies were later published by the Nazis and given to soldiers on the front during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Jack Fischel 1998. p. 5"/&gt; One antisemitic ideologue of the period, [[Friedrich Lange (journalist)|Friedrich Lange]], even used the term "National Socialism" to describe his own anti-capitalist take on the ''Völkisch'' nationalist template.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1990, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] accused [[Jews]] in Germany of having been and inevitably of continuing to be a "state within a state" that threatened German national unity.&lt;ref name=Ryback2010_129/&gt; Fichte promoted two options in order to address this, his first one being the creation of a Jewish state in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] so the Jews could be impelled to leave Europe.{{sfn|Ryback|2010|p=130}} His second option was violence against Jews and he said that the goal of the violence would be "to cut off all their heads in one night, and set new ones on their shoulders, which should not contain a single Jewish idea".{{sfn|Ryback|2010|p=130}}

[[File:1.2 The Jewish Bolshevism Image.png|thumb|upright|Caricatures of [[Bolshevik]] leaders [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Karl Radek]], [[Julius Martov]] and [[Emma Goldman]] from [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s ''[[The Jewish Bolshevism]]'', which assert that Bolshevism is a Jewish ideology]]

''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (1912) is an antisemitic forgery created by the secret service of the Russian Empire, the [[Okhrana]]. Many antisemites believed it was real and thus it became widely popular after World War I.&lt;ref name="stackelberg"/&gt; ''The Protocols'' claimed that there was a secret international Jewish conspiracy to take over the world.&lt;ref name="kershaw"/&gt; Hitler had been introduced to ''The Protocols'' by [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and from 1920 onwards he focused his attacks by claiming that [[Judaism]] and Marxism were directly connected, that Jews and [[Bolsheviks]] were one and the same and that Marxism was a Jewish ideology-this became known as "[[Jewish Bolshevism]]".&lt;ref name="dictator"/&gt; Hitler believed that ''The Protocols'' were authentic.&lt;ref name="dictator11"/&gt;

Prior to the Nazi ascension to power, Hitler often blamed moral degradation on ''[[Rassenschande]]'' ("racial defilement"), a way to assure his followers of his continuing antisemitism, which had been toned down for popular consumption.&lt;ref name="Koonz2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Koonz|title=The Nazi Conscience|date=1 November 2005|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01842-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the induction of the Nuremberg Race Laws in 1935 by the Nazis, many German nationalists such as [[Roland Freisler]] strongly supported laws to ban ''Rassenschande'' between Aryans and Jews as racial treason.&lt;ref name="Koonz2005"/&gt; Even before the laws were officially passed, the Nazis banned sexual relations and marriages between party members and Jews.&lt;ref name="Weikart2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Weikart|title=Hitler's Ethic|date=21 July 2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-62398-9|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Party members found guilty of ''Rassenschande'' were severely punished; some party members were even sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="Gordon1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah Ann Gordon|title=Hitler, Germans, and the "Jewish Question"|year=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10162-0|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis claimed that Bismarck was unable to complete German national unification because Jews had infiltrated the German parliament and they claimed that their abolition of parliament had ended this obstacle to unification.&lt;ref name=Gerwarth2007/&gt; Using the [[stab-in-the-back myth]], the Nazis accused Jews—and other populations who it considered non-German—of possessing extra-national loyalties, thereby exacerbating German [[antisemitism]] about the ''[[Jewish question|Judenfrage]]'' (the Jewish Question), the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political [[Antisemitic canard|canard]] which was popular when the ethnic [[Völkisch movement]] and its politics of [[Romantic nationalism]] for establishing a ''[[German question#Later influence|Großdeutschland]]'' was strong.&lt;ref name=PostWWIAntisemitism/&gt;&lt;ref name="JFrage"/&gt;

Nazism's racial policy positions may have developed from the views of important biologists of the 19th century, including French [[biologist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], through [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s idealist version of [[Lamarckism]] and the father of [[genetics]], German [[Botany|botanist]] [[Gregor Mendel]].&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 1989. pp. 304-305"/&gt; However, Haeckel's works were later condemned and banned from bookshops and libraries by the Nazis as inappropriate for "National-Socialist formation and education in the Third Reich". This may have been because of his "[[Monism|monist]]" [[Atheism|atheistic]], [[Materialism|materialist]] philosophy, which the Nazis disliked.&lt;ref name="Robert J. Richards 2008. pp. 7-8"/&gt; Unlike Darwinian theory, Lamarckian theory officially ranked races in a hierarchy of evolution from [[ape]]s while Darwinian theory did not grade races in a hierarchy of higher or lower evolution from apes, but simply stated that all humans as a whole had progressed in their evolution from apes.&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 1989. pp. 304-305"/&gt; Many Lamarckians viewed "lower" races as having been exposed to debilitating conditions for too long for any significant "improvement" of their condition to take place in the near future.&lt;ref name="evolution"/&gt; Haeckel utilised Lamarckian theory to describe the existence of interracial struggle and put races on a hierarchy of evolution, ranging from wholly human to [[Untermensch|subhuman]].&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 1989. pp. 304-305"/&gt;

[[Mendelian inheritance]], or Mendelism, was supported by the Nazis, as well as by mainstream eugenicists of the time. The Mendelian theory of inheritance declared that genetic traits and attributes were passed from one generation to another.&lt;ref name="university14"/&gt; Eugenicists used Mendelian inheritance theory to demonstrate the transfer of biological illness and impairments from parents to children, including mental disability, whereas others also utilised Mendelian theory to demonstrate the inheritance of social traits, with racialists claiming a racial nature behind certain general traits such as inventiveness or criminal behaviour.&lt;ref name="friedlander"/&gt;

During World War I, German sociologist [[Johann Plenge]] spoke of the rise of a "National Socialism" in Germany within what he termed the "[[Spirit of 1914|ideas of 1914]]" that were a declaration of war against the "ideas of 1789" (the [[French Revolution]]).&lt;ref name="Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205"/&gt; According to Plenge, the "ideas of 1789" which included the rights of man, democracy, individualism and liberalism were being rejected in favour of "the ideas of 1914" which included the "German values" of duty, discipline, law and order.&lt;ref name="Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205" /&gt; Plenge believed that ethnic solidarity (''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'') would replace class division and that "racial comrades" would unite to create a socialist society in the struggle of "proletarian" Germany against "capitalist" Britain.&lt;ref name="Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205" /&gt; He believed that the "Spirit of 1914" manifested itself in the concept of the "People's League of National Socialism".&lt;ref name="Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf 1997. p. 92" /&gt; This National Socialism was a form of [[state socialism]] that rejected the "idea of boundless freedom" and promoted an economy that would serve the whole of Germany under the leadership of the state.&lt;ref name="Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf 1997. p. 92" /&gt; This National Socialism was opposed to capitalism due to the components that were against "the national interest" of Germany, but insisted that National Socialism would strive for greater efficiency in the economy.&lt;ref name="Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf 1997. p. 92" /&gt; Plenge advocated an authoritarian, rational ruling elite to develop National Socialism through a hierarchical [[Technocracy|technocratic]] state,&lt;ref name="Thomas Rohkrämer 2007. p. 130" /&gt; and his ideas were part of the basis of Nazism.&lt;ref name="Martin Kitchen 2006. p. 205"/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R06610, Oswald Spengler.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Oswald Spengler]], a philosopher of history]]

[[Oswald Spengler]], a German cultural philosopher, was a major influence on Nazism, although after 1933 he became alienated from Nazism and was later condemned by the Nazis for criticising Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt; Spengler's conception of national socialism and a number of his political views were shared by the Nazis and the [[Conservative Revolutionary movement]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; Spengler's views were also popular amongst [[Italian fascism|Italian Fascists]], including [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia15"/&gt;

Spengler's book ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (1918), written during the final months of [[World War I]], addressed the supposed [[decadence]] of modern European civilization, which he claimed was caused by atomising and irreligious individualisation and [[cosmopolitanism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated16/&gt; Spengler's major thesis was that a law of historical development of cultures existed involving a cycle of birth, maturity, ageing and death when it reaches its final form of civilisation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt; Upon reaching the point of civilisation, a culture will lose its creative capacity and succumb to [[decadence]] until the emergence of "[[barbarian]]s" creates a new epoch.&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt; Spengler considered the [[Western world]] as having succumbed to decadence of intellect, money, [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] urban life, irreligious life, [[wiktionary:Atomization|atomised]] [[individualism|individualisation]] and believed that it was at the end of its biological and "spiritual" fertility.&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt; He believed that the "young" German nation as an imperial power would inherit the legacy of [[Ancient Rome]], lead a restoration of value in "[[Bloodline|blood]]" and instinct, while the ideals of rationalism would be revealed as absurd.&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt;

Spengler's notions of "Prussian socialism" as described in his book ''[[Preussentum und Sozialismus]]'' ("Prussiandom and Socialism", 1919), influenced Nazism and the [[Conservative Revolutionary movement]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; Spengler wrote: "The meaning of socialism is that life is controlled not by the opposition between rich and poor, but by the rank that achievement and talent bestow. That is ''our'' freedom, freedom from the economic despotism of the individual".&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; Spengler adopted the anti-English ideas addressed by Plenge and Sombart during World War I that condemned English liberalism and English parliamentarianism while advocating a national socialism that was free from [[Marxism]] and that would connect the individual to the state through [[Corporatism|corporatist]] organisation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt; Spengler claimed that socialistic Prussian characteristics existed across Germany, including creativity, discipline, concern for the greater good, productivity and self-sacrifice.&lt;ref name="university17"/&gt; He prescribed war as a necessity by saying: "War is the eternal form of higher human existence and states exist for war: they are the expression of the will to war".&lt;ref name="university18"/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-091-20, Kapp-Putsch, Marine-Brigade Erhardt.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Marinebrigade Erhardt]] during the [[Kapp Putsch]] in Berlin, 1920&lt;ref&gt;German Federal Archive image description&lt;/ref&gt; (the Marinebrigade Erhardt used the [[swastika]] as its symbol, as seen on their helmets and on the truck, which inspired the Nazi Party to adopt it as the movement's symbol)]]

Spengler's definition of socialism did not advocate a change to property relations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; He denounced [[Marxism]] for seeking to train the proletariat to "expropriate the expropriator", the capitalist and then to let them live a life of leisure on this expropriation.&lt;ref name="H. Stuart Hughes 1992. p. 108"/&gt; He claimed that "Marxism is the capitalism of the working class" and not true socialism.&lt;ref name="H. Stuart Hughes 1992. p. 108"/&gt; According to Spengler, true socialism would be in the form of corporatism, stating that "local corporate bodies organised according to the importance of each occupation to the people as a whole; higher representation in stages up to a supreme council of the state; mandates revocable at any time; no organised parties, no professional politicians, no periodic elections".&lt;ref name="transaction"/&gt;

[[File:Das Dritte Reich.jpg|thumb|upright|The book ''[[Das Dritte Reich]]'' (1923), translated as "The Third Reich", by [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]]]]

Wilhelm Stapel, an antisemitic German intellectual, utilised Spengler's thesis on the cultural confrontation between Jews as whom Spengler described as a [[Magi]]an people versus [[Europeans]] as a [[Faust]]ian people.&lt;ref name="MordecaiKaplan"&gt;{{cite book |first=Mordecai M. |last=Kaplan |title=Judaism as a Civilization: Toward a Reconstruction of American-Jewish Life |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stapel described Jews as a landless nomadic people in pursuit of an international culture whereby they can integrate into Western civilisation.&lt;ref name="MordecaiKaplan"/&gt; As such, Stapel claims that Jews have been attracted to "international" versions of socialism, pacifism or capitalism because as a landless people the Jews have transgressed various national cultural boundaries.&lt;ref name="MordecaiKaplan"/&gt;

[[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]] was initially the dominant figure of the Conservative Revolutionaries influenced Nazism.&lt;ref name="university19"/&gt; He rejected [[reactionary]] conservatism while proposing a new state that he coined the "Third Reich", which would unite all classes under [[authoritarian]] rule.&lt;ref name="macmillan"/&gt; Van den Bruck advocated a combination of the nationalism of the right and the socialism of the left.&lt;ref name="millennial"/&gt;

[[Fascism]] was a major influence on Nazism. The seizure of power by Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini in the [[March on Rome]] in 1922 drew admiration by Hitler, who less than a month later had begun to model himself and the [[Nazi Party]] upon Mussolini and the Fascists.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=182}} Hitler presented the Nazis as a form of German fascism.&lt;ref name="Fulda, Bernhard 2009. p. 65"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlsten, F. L. 1982. p. 80"/&gt; In November 1923, the Nazis attempted a "March on Berlin" modelled after the March on Rome, which resulted in the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in [[Munich]].&lt;ref name="dissolution"/&gt;

Hitler spoke of Nazism being indebted to the success of Fascism's rise to power in Italy.&lt;ref name="Hugh R. Trevor-Roper 2008. p10"&gt;Hugh R. Trevor-Roper (ed.), Gerhard L. Weinberg (ed.). Hitler's Table Talk 1941-1944: Secret Conversations. Enigma Books, 2008. p10&lt;/ref&gt; In a private conversation in 1941, Hitler said that "the brown shirt would probably not have existed without the black shirt", the "brown shirt" referring to the Nazi militia and the "black shirt" referring to the Fascist militia.&lt;ref name="Hugh R. Trevor-Roper 2008. p10"/&gt; He also said in regards to the 1920s: "If Mussolini had been outdistanced by Marxism, I don't know whether we could have succeeded in holding out. At that period National Socialism was a very fragile growth".&lt;ref name="Hugh R. Trevor-Roper 2008. p10"/&gt;

Other Nazis—especially those at the time associated with the party's more radical wing such as [[Gregor Strasser]], Joseph Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler—rejected Italian Fascism, accusing it of being too conservative or capitalist.&lt;ref name="university21"/&gt; [[Alfred Rosenberg]] condemned Italian Fascism for being racially confused and having influences from [[Philo-Semitism|philosemitism]].&lt;ref name="stanley"/&gt; Strasser criticised the policy of ''[[Führerprinzip]]'' as being created by Mussolini and considered its presence in Nazism as a foreign imported idea.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995. p. 464"/&gt; Throughout the relationship between Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, a number of lower-ranking Nazis scornfully viewed fascism as a conservative movement that lacked a full revolutionary potential.&lt;ref name="Stanley G. Payne 1995. p. 464"/&gt;

==Ideology==

===Nationalism and racialism===
{{Further|Nazism and race|Racial policy of Nazi Germany}}
Nazism emphasized [[German nationalism]], including both [[irredentism]] and [[expansionism]]. Nazism held racial theories based upon a belief in the existence of an [[Aryan race|Aryan master race]] that was superior to all other races. The Nazis emphasised the existence of racial conflict between the Aryan race and others—particularly Jews, whom the Nazis viewed as a mixed race that had infiltrated multiple societies and was responsible for exploitation and repression of the Aryan race. The Nazis also categorised [[Slavs]] as ''[[Untermensch]]'' (sub-human).&lt;ref&gt;Steve Thorne. The Language of War. London, England, UK: Routledge, 2006. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irredentism and expansionism====
{{further|Lebensraum}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv R 49 Bild-0131, Aussiedlung von Polen im Wartheland.jpg|thumb|Beginning of ''Lebensraum'', the [[Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|Nazi German expulsion of Poles]] from [[Reichsgau Wartheland|central Poland]], 1939]]

The German Nazi Party supported German irredentist claims to [[Austria]], [[Alsace-Lorraine]], the region now known as the [[Czech Republic]] and the territory known since 1919 as the [[Polish Corridor]]. A major policy of the German Nazi Party was ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space") for the German nation based on claims that Germany after World War I was facing an overpopulation crisis and that expansion was needed to end the country's overpopulation within existing confined territory, and provide resources necessary to its people's well-being.&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Lee 1945. P. 237"&gt;Stephen J. Lee. ''Europe, 1890-1945''. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1920s, the Nazi Party publicly promoted the expansion of Germany into territories held by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Peter D. Stachura P. 31"&gt;Peter D. Stachura. ''The Shaping of the Nazi State''. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler stated that ''Lebensraum'' would be acquired in Eastern Europe, especially Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph W. Bendersk, A History of Nazi Germany: 1919-1945, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; In his early years as the Nazi leader, Hitler had claimed that he would be willing to accept friendly relations with Russia on the tactical condition that Russia agree to return to the borders established by the German–Russian peace agreement of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] signed by [[Vladimir Lenin]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]] in 1918 which gave large territories held by Russia to German control in exchange for peace.&lt;ref name="Peter D. Stachura P. 31"/&gt; In 1921, Hitler had commended the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as opening the possibility for restoration of relations between Germany and Russia by saying:

{{quote|Through the peace with Russia the sustenance of Germany as well as the provision of work were to have been secured by the acquisition of land and soil, by access to raw materials, and by friendly relations between the two lands.|Adolf Hitler&lt;ref name="Peter D. Stachura P. 31"/&gt;}}

[[File:Europe topography map.png|thumb|Topographical map of Europe: the Nazi Party declared support for ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' (expansion of Germany east to the Ural Mountains), that is shown on the upper right side of the map as a brown diagonal line]]

From 1921 to 1922, Hitler evoked rhetoric of both the achievement of ''Lebensraum'' involving the acceptance of a territorially reduced Russia as well as supporting Russian nationals in overthrowing the Bolshevik government and establishing a new Russian government.&lt;ref name="Peter D. Stachura P. 31"/&gt; Hitler's attitudes changed by the end of 1922, in which he then supported an alliance of Germany with Britain to destroy Russia.&lt;ref name="Peter D. Stachura P. 31"/&gt; Hitler later declared how far he intended to expand Germany into Russia:

{{quote|Asia, what a disquieting reservoir of men! The safety of Europe will not be assured until we have driven Asia back behind the Urals. No organized Russian state must be allowed to exist west of that line.|Adolf Hitler&lt;ref name="André Mineau 2004. P. 36"&gt;André Mineau.

====Racial theories====
In its [[Race (human categorization)|racial categorization]], Nazism viewed what it called the [[Aryan race]] as the [[master race]] of the world—a race that was superior to all other races.&lt;ref name="George Lachmann Mosse p79"&gt;George Lachmann Mosse. Nazi Culture: Intellectual, Cultural and Social Life in the Third Reich. p79.&lt;/ref&gt; It viewed Aryans as being in racial conflict with a mixed race people, the [[Jews]], whom the Nazis identified as a dangerous enemy of the Aryans. It also viewed a number of other peoples as dangerous to the well-being of the Aryan race. In order to preserve the perceived racial purity of the Aryan race, a set of race laws was introduced in 1935 which came to be known as the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. At first these laws only prevented sexual relations and marriages between Germans and Jews, but they were later extended to the "[[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Black people|Negroes]], and their bastard offspring", who were described by the Nazis as people of "alien blood".&lt;ref name=RGallately&gt;{{cite book |author=S.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-16748, Ausstellung "Wunder des Lebens".jpg|thumb|A "poster information" from the exhibition "''Miracle of Life''" in Berlin in 1935]]

A Nazi era school textbook for German students entitled ''Heredity and Racial Biology for Students'' written by Jakob Graf described to students the Nazi conception of the Aryan race in a section titled "The Aryan: The Creative Force in Human History".&lt;ref name="George Lachmann Mosse p79"/&gt; Graf claimed that the original Aryans developed from Nordic peoples who invaded ancient India and launched the initial development of Aryan culture there that later spread to ancient Persia and he claimed that the Aryan presence in Persia was what was responsible for its development into an empire.&lt;ref name="George Lachmann Mosse p79"/&gt; He claimed that [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek culture]] was developed by Nordic peoples due to paintings of the time which showed Greeks who were tall, light-skinned, light-eyed, blond-haired people.&lt;ref name="George Lachmann Mosse p79"/&gt; He said that the [[Roman Empire]] was developed by the [[Italic peoples|Italics]] who were related to the [[Celts]] who were also a Nordic people.&lt;ref name="George Lachmann Mosse p79"/&gt; He believed that the vanishing of the Nordic component of the populations in Greece and Rome led to their downfall.&lt;ref name="George Lachmann Mosse p79"/&gt; The [[Renaissance]] was claimed to have developed in the [[Western Roman Empire]] because of the Germanic invasions that brought new Nordic blood to the Empire's lands, such as the presence of Nordic blood in the [[Lombards]] (referred to as Longobards in the book); that remnants of the western Goths were responsible for the creation of the [[Spanish Empire]]; and that the heritage of the [[Franks]], [[Goths]] and Germanic peoples in [[France]] was what was responsible for its rise as a major power.&lt;ref name="George Lachmann Mosse p79"/&gt; He claimed that the rise of the [[Russian Empire]] was due to its leadership by people of [[Normans|Norman]] descent.&lt;ref name="George Lachmann Mosse p79"/&gt; He described the rise of Anglo-Saxon societies in [[North America]], [[South Africa]] and [[Australia]] as being the result of the Nordic heritage of [[Anglo-Saxons]].&lt;ref name="George Lachmann Mosse p79"/&gt; He concluded these points by saying: "Everywhere Nordic creative power has built mighty empires with high-minded ideas, and to this very day [[Indo-European languages|Aryan languages]] and cultural values are spread over a large part of the world, though the creative Nordic blood has long since vanished in many places".&lt;ref name="George Lachmann Mosse p79"/&gt;

[[File:Buchenwald Corpses 60623.jpg|thumb|left|A wagon piled high with corpses outside the crematorium in [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]]]

In Nazi Germany, the idea of creating a master race resulted in efforts to "purify" the ''Deutsche Volk'' through [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]] and its culmination was the [[compulsory sterilization]] or the [[involuntary euthanasia]] of physically or mentally disabled people. After World War II, the euthanasia programme was named [[Action T4]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandner (1999): 385 ([http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/1999_3.pdf 66 in PDF]) Note 2. The author claims that the term Aktion T4 was not used by the Nazis and that it was first used in the trials of the doctors and later included in the historiography.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideological justification for [[euthanasia]] was Hitler's view of [[Sparta]] (11th century – 195 BC) as the original ''Völkisch'' state and he praised Sparta's dispassionate destruction of congenitally deformed infants in order to maintain racial purity.&lt;ref name="pathological"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Social Darwinism in European and American Thought, 1860–1945: nature as model and nature as threat"/&gt; Some non-Aryans enlisted in Nazi organisations like the [[Hitler Youth]] and the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', including Germans of African descent&lt;ref name="experiences"/&gt; and Jewish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan Mark Rigg|title=Hitler's Jewish Soldiers: The Untold Story Of Nazi Racial Laws And Men Of Jewish Descent In The German Military|date=1 September 2004|publisher=University Press of Kansas|isbn=978-0-7006-1358-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis began to implement "racial hygiene" policies as soon as they came to power. The July 1933 "Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring" prescribed compulsory sterilization for people with a range of conditions which were thought to be hereditary, such as [[schizophrenia]], [[epilepsy]], [[Huntington's chorea]] and "[[Intellectual disability|imbecility]]". Sterilization was also mandated for chronic [[alcoholism]] and other forms of [[Deviance (sociology)|social deviance]].&lt;ref name="Evans10"/&gt; An estimated 360,000 people were sterilised under this law between 1933 and 1939. Although some Nazis suggested that the programme should be extended to people with physical disabilities, such ideas had to be expressed carefully, given the fact that some Nazis had physical disabilities, one example being one of the most powerful figures of the regime, Joseph Goebbels, who had a deformed right leg.&lt;ref&gt;This was the result of either a [[club foot]] or [[osteomyelitis]]. Goebbels is commonly said to have had [[club foot]] (''talipes equinovarus''), a congenital condition. [[William L. Shirer]], who worked in Berlin as a journalist in the 1930s and was acquainted with Goebbels, wrote in ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'' (1960) that the deformity was caused by a childhood attack of [[osteomyelitis]] and a failed operation to correct it.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi racial theorist [[Hans F. K. Günther]] argued that European peoples were divided into five races: [[Nordic race|Nordic]], [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]], [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]], [[Alpine race|Alpine]] and [[East Baltic race|East Baltic]].&lt;ref name="Baum2006_156" /&gt; Günther applied a [[Nordicism|Nordicist]] conception in order to justify his belief that Nordics were the highest in the racial hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Baum2006_156" /&gt; In his book ''[[Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes]]'' (1922) ("Racial Science of the German People"), Günther recognised Germans as being composed of all five races, but emphasized the strong Nordic heritage among them.&lt;ref name="Maxwell150"&gt;Anne Maxwell.

Germany (Racism Analysis |Yearbook 2 - 2011) Ed. by Wulf D. Hund, Christian Koller, Moshe Zimmermann page 19&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis described Jews as being a racially mixed group of primarily [[Armenoid race|Near Eastern]] and [[Arabid race|Oriental]] racial types.&lt;ref name="Weinreich111"&gt;Max Weinreich. ''Hitler's Professors: The Part of Scholarship in Germany's Crimes Against the Jewish People''. Yale University Press, 1999. P. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Because such racial groups were concentrated outside Europe, the Nazis claimed that Jews were "racially alien" to all European peoples and that they did not have deep racial roots in Europe.&lt;ref name="Weinreich111" /&gt;

Günther emphasized Jews' Near Eastern racial heritage.&lt;ref name="Alan E Steinweis 2008. P. 28"&gt;Steinweis, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Günther identified the mass conversion of the [[Khazars]] to [[Judaism]] in the 8th century as creating the two major branches of the Jewish people, those of primarily Near Eastern racial heritage became the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] (that he called Eastern Jews) while those of primarily Oriental racial heritage became the [[Sephardi Jews]] (that he called Southern Jews).&lt;ref name="Alan E Steinweis 2008. P. 31-32"&gt;Steinweis, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; Günther claimed that the Near Eastern type was composed of commercially spirited and artful traders, that the type held strong [[psychological manipulation]] skills which aided them in trade.&lt;ref name="Alan E Steinweis 2008. P. 28"/&gt; He claimed that the Near Eastern race had been "bred not so much for the conquest and exploitation of nature as it had been for the conquest and exploitation of people".&lt;ref name="Alan E Steinweis 2008. P. 28"/&gt; Günther believed that European peoples had a racially motivated aversion to peoples of Near Eastern racial origin and their traits, and as evidence of this he showed multiple examples of depictions of satanic figures with Near Eastern physiognomies in European art.&lt;ref name="Alan E Steinweis 2008. P. 29"&gt;Steinweis, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler's conception of the Aryan ''[[Herrenvolk]]'' ("Aryan master race") excluded the vast majority of [[Slavs]] from central and eastern Europe (i.e. [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|Poles]], [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], etc.). They were regarded as a race of men not inclined to a higher form of [[civilization]], which was under an instinctive force that reverted them back to nature. The Nazis also regarded the Slavs as having dangerous Jewish and Asiatic, meaning [[Mongols|Mongol]], influences.&lt;ref&gt;André Mineau. ''Operation Barbarossa: Ideology and Ethics Against Human Dignity''.

Hitler declared that racial conflict against Jews was necessary in order to save Germany from suffering under them and he dismissed concerns that the conflict with them was inhumane and unjust:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We may be inhumane, but if we rescue Germany we have achieved the greatest deed in the world. We may work injustice, but if we rescue Germany then we have removed the greatest injustice in the world. We may be immoral, but if our people is rescued we have opened the way for morality.&lt;ref name="koenigsberg"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels frequently employed antisemitic rhetoric to underline this view: "The Jew is the enemy and the destroyer of the purity of blood, the conscious destroyer of our race."&lt;ref name="thosedamnednazis"/&gt;

===Social class===

National Socialist politics was based on competition and struggle as its organizing principle, and the Nazis believed that "human life consisted of eternal struggle and competition and derived its meaning from struggle and competition."{{sfn|Mason|1993|pp=6}} The Nazis saw this eternal struggle in military terms, and advocated a society organized like an army in order to achieve success. They promoted the idea of a national-racial "people's community" (''Volksgemeinschaft'') in order to accomplish "the efficient prosecution of the struggle against other peoples and states."{{sfn|Mason|1993|pp=7}} Like an army, the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' was meant to consist of a hierarchy of ranks or classes of people, some commanding and others obeying, all working together for a common goal.{{sfn|Mason|1993|pp=7}} This concept was rooted in the writings of 19th century ''völkisch'' authors who glorified medieval German society, viewing it as a "community rooted in the land and bound together by custom and tradition," in which there was neither class conflict nor selfish individualism.{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=40}}

Nazism rejected the [[Marxism|Marxist]] concept of [[class conflict]], and it praised both German capitalists and German workers as essential to the ''Volksgemeinschaft''. In the ''Volksgemeinschaft'', social classes would continue to exist, but there would be no class conflict between them.{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=48}} Hitler said that "the capitalists have worked their way to the top through their capacity, and as the basis of this selection, which again only proves their higher race, they have a right to lead."&lt;ref name="Nicholls 245"&gt;David Nicholls. ''Adolf Hitler: A Biographical Companion''. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2000. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; German business leaders co-operated with the Nazis during their rise to power and received substantial benefits from the Nazi state after it was established, including high profits and state-sanctioned monopolies and cartels.&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger, Richard, ''A Social History of the Third Reich'', Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1971. p. 167, 175-176&lt;/ref&gt; Large celebrations and symbolism were used extensively to encourage those engaged in physical labour on behalf of Germany, with leading National Socialists often praising the "honour of labour", which fostered a sense of community (''Gemeinschaft'') for the German people and promoted solidarity towards the Nazi cause.&lt;ref&gt;Alf Lüdtke, "The 'Honor of Labor': Industrial Workers and the Power of Symbols under National Socialism", in ''Nazism and German Society, 1933-1945'', edited by David F. Crew (New York: Routledge, 1994), pp. 67-109.&lt;/ref&gt; To win workers away from Marxism, Nazi propaganda sometimes presented its expansionist foreign policy goals as a "class struggle between nations."&lt;ref name="Nicholls 245"/&gt; Bonfires were made of school children's differently coloured caps as symbolic of the unity of different social classes.&lt;ref name="Grunberger46"&gt;[[Richard Grunberger]], ''The 12-Year Reich'', p. 46, {{ISBN|003-076435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, Hitler discredited other nationalist and [[Racialism|racialist]] political parties as disconnected from the mass populace, especially lower and working-class young people:

{{quote|The racialists were not capable of drawing the practical conclusions from correct theoretical judgements, especially in the Jewish Question. In this way, the German racialist movement developed a similar pattern to that of the 1880s and 1890s. As in those days, its leadership gradually fell into the hands of highly honourable, but fantastically naïve men of learning, professors, district counsellors, schoolmasters, and lawyers—in short a bourgeois, idealistic, and refined class. It lacked the warm breath of the nation's youthful vigour.&lt;ref name="burleigh"/&gt;}}

Nevertheless, the Nazi Party's voter base consisted mainly of farmers and the middle class, including groups such as Weimar government officials, school teachers, doctors, clerks, self-employed businessmen, salesmen, retired officers, engineers, and students.{{sfn|Mason|1993|pp=48-50}} Their demands included lower taxes, higher prices for food, restrictions on department stores and consumer co-operatives, and reductions in social services and wages.{{sfn|Mason|1993|pp=49}} The need to maintain the support of these groups made it difficult for the Nazis to appeal to the working class, since the working class often had opposite demands.{{sfn|Mason|1993|pp=49}}

From 1928 onward, the Nazi Party's growth into a large national political movement was dependent on middle class support, and on the public perception that it "promised to side with the middle classes and to confront the economic and political power of the working class." {{sfn|Mason|1993|pp=44}} The financial collapse of the [[White-collar worker|white collar]] middle-class of the 1920s figures much in their strong support of Nazism.&lt;ref name="Burleigh, 2000. p. 77"/&gt; Although the Nazis continued to make appeals to "the German worker," historian Timothy Mason concludes that "Hitler had nothing but slogans to offer the working class."{{sfn|Mason|1993|pp=48}}

===Sex and gender===
{{Further|Women in Nazi Germany}}
[[File:Pflichten der polen.jpg|thumb|Obligations of Polish workers in Germany, warning them of the death penalty for any sexual relations between Germans and Poles]]

Nazi ideology advocated excluding women from political involvement and confining them to the spheres of "[[Kinder, Küche, Kirche]]" (Children, Kitchen, Church).&lt;ref&gt;For more elucidation about this conception and its oversimplification, see: Renate Bridenthal and Claudia Koonz, "Beyond ''Kinder, Küche, Kirche'': Weimar Women in Politics and Work" in Renate Bridenthal, et al. (eds), ''When Biology Became Destiny in Weimar and Nazi Germany'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1984), pp. 33-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Many women enthusiastically supported the regime, but formed their own internal hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Koonz, ''Mothers in the Fatherland: Women, the Family and Nazi Politics'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1988), pp. 53-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's own opinion on the matter of women in Nazi Germany was that while other eras of German history had experienced the development and liberation of the female mind, the National Socialist goal was essentially singular in that it wished for them to produce a child.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler on 23 November 1937. In Max Domarus ed., ''Hitler: Reden und Proklamationen, 1932-1945'', (vol I). Triumph. (Würzburg: Verlagsdruckerei Schmidt, 1962), p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this theme, Hitler once remarked about women that "with every child that she brings into the world, she fights her battle for the nation. The man stands up for the ''Volk'', exactly as the woman stands up for the family".&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Hitler in a speech to the National Socialist Women's Congress, published in the ''Völkischer Beobachter'', 15 September 1935 (Wiener Library Clipping Collection). Cited from: George Mosse, ''Nazi Culture: Intellectual, Cultural and Social Life in the Third Reich'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2003), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Proto-natalist programs in Nazi Germany offered favourable loans and grants to newlyweds and encouraged them to give birth to offspring by providing them with additional incentives.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Koonz, ''Mothers in the Fatherland: Women, the Family and Nazi Politics'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1988), p. 149, pp. 185-187.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birth control|Contraception]] was discouraged for racially valuable women in Nazi Germany and [[abortion]] was forbidden by strict legal mandates, including prison sentences for women who sought them as well as prison sentences for doctors who performed them, whereas abortion for racially "undesirable" persons was encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Stephenson, ''Women in Nazi Germany'' (London and New York: Longman, 2001), pp. 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerda Bormann was concerned by the ratio of racially valuable women that outnumbered men and she thought that the war would make the situation worse in terms of childbirths, so much so that she advocated a law (never realised however) which allowed healthy Aryan men to have two wives. See: Anna Maria Sigmund, ''Women of the Third Reich'' (Ontario: NDE, 2000), pp. 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

While unmarried until the very end of the regime, Hitler often made excuses about his busy life hindering any chance for marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Maria Sigmund, ''Women of the Third Reich'' (Ontario: NDE, 2000), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Among National Socialist ideologues, marriage was valued not for moral considerations but because it provided an optimal breeding environment. ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] reportedly told a confidant that when he established the ''[[Lebensborn]]'' program, an organisation that would dramatically increase the birth rate of "Aryan" children through extramarital relations between women classified as racially pure and their male equals, he had only the purest male "conception assistants" in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Himmler was thinking about members of the SS fulfilling this task. See: Felix Kersten, ''Totenkopf und Treue. Aus den Tagebuchblättern des finnischen Medizinalrats Felix Kersten'' (Hamburg: Mölich Verlag, 1952), pp. 228-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Nazis extended the ''[[Rassenschande]]'' ("race defilement") law to all foreigners at the beginning of the war,{{sfn|Majer|2003|p=180}} pamphlets were issued to German women which ordered them to avoid sexual relations with foreign workers who were brought to Germany and the pamphlets also ordered German women to view these same foreign workers as a danger to their blood.&lt;ref name="Rupp1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leila J.

After the decrees were enacted, Himmler stated:

{{quote|Fellow Germans who engage in sexual relations with male or female civil workers of the [[Poles|Polish]] nationality, commit other immoral acts or engage in love affairs shall be arrested immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-dishonorable-german-girls-the-forgotten-persecution-of-women-in-world-war-ii-a-672803.html|title=The 'Dishonorable' German Girls: The Forgotten Persecution of Women in World War II |last=Friedmann|first=Jan|work=Der Spiegel|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[League of German Girls]] was particularly regarded as instructing girls to avoid race defilement, which was treated with particular importance for young females.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/fink.htm The Jewish Question in Education]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orsen.jpg|thumb|Hitler in 1935 with [[Cesare Orsenigo]], the [[Catholic Church]]'s [[nuncio to Germany]]]]

The [[National Socialist Program|Nazi Party Programme]] of 1920 guaranteed freedom for all religious denominations which were not hostile to the State and it also endorsed [[Positive Christianity]] in order to combat "the Jewish-materialist spirit".&lt;ref name="documents"/&gt; Positive Christianity was a modified version of [[Christianity]] which emphasized [[Racial hygiene|racial purity]] and [[nationalism]].{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=182}} The Nazis were aided by theologians such as [[Ernst Bergmann (philosopher)|Ernst Bergmann]]. In his work ''Die 25 Thesen der Deutschreligion'' (''Twenty-five Points of the German Religion''), Bergmann held the view that the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]] was inaccurate along with portions of the [[New Testament]], claimed that [[Jesus]] was not a Jew but was instead of Aryan origin and he also claimed that [[Adolf Hitler]] was the new [[messiah]].{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=182}}

Hitler denounced the Old Testament as "[[Satan]]'s Bible" and utilising components of the New Testament he attempted to prove that Jesus was both an Aryan and an antisemite by citing passages such as [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8:44 John 8:44] where he noted that Jesus is yelling at "the Jews", as well as saying to them "your father is the devil" and the [[Cleansing of the Temple]], which describes Jesus' whipping of the "Children of the Devil".&lt;ref name="Redles60"&gt;David Redles. ''Hitler's Millennial Reich: Apocalyptic Belief and the Search for Salvation''. New York, New York, USA; London, England, UK: New York University Press, 2005. p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler claimed that the New Testament included distortions by [[Paul the Apostle]], who Hitler described as a "mass-murderer turned saint".&lt;ref name="Redles60"/&gt; In their propaganda, the Nazis utilised the writings of [[Martin Luther]], the founder of [[Protestantism]]. They publicly displayed an original edition of Luther's ''[[On the Jews and their Lies]]'' during the annual Nuremberg rallies.&lt;ref name="understandably"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baylor"/&gt; The Nazis endorsed the pro-Nazi Protestant [[German Christians]] organization.

The Nazis were initially very hostile to Catholics because most Catholics supported the [[German Centre Party]]. Catholics opposed the Nazis' promotion of [[compulsory sterilization]] of those whom they deemed inferior and the [[Catholic Church]] forbade its members to vote for the Nazis. In 1933, extensive Nazi violence occurred against Catholics due to their association with the Centre Party and their opposition to the Nazi regime's sterilization laws.&lt;ref name="international27"/&gt; The Nazis demanded that Catholics declare their loyalty to the German state.&lt;ref name="Robert Anthony Krieg 2004. p. 4"/&gt; In their propaganda, the Nazis used elements of Germany's Catholic history, in particular the German Catholic [[Teutonic Knights]] and their campaigns in [[Eastern Europe]]. The Nazis identified them as "sentinels" in the East against "Slavic chaos", though beyond that symbolism, the influence of the Teutonic Knights on Nazism was limited.&lt;ref name="interaction"/&gt; Hitler also admitted that the Nazis' night rallies were inspired by the Catholic rituals which he had witnessed during his Catholic upbringing.&lt;ref name="Roger Griffin 2005. p. 85"/&gt; The Nazis did seek official reconciliation with the Catholic Church and they endorsed the creation of the pro-Nazi Catholic ''[[Kreuz und Adler]]'', an organization which advocated a form of [[national Catholicism]] that would reconcile the Catholic Church's beliefs with Nazism.&lt;ref name="Robert Anthony Krieg 2004. p. 4"/&gt; On 20 July 1933, a concordat (''[[Reichskonkordat]]'') was signed between Nazi Germany and the Catholic Church, which in exchange for acceptance of the Catholic Church in Germany required German Catholics to be loyal to the German state. The Catholic Church then ended its ban on members supporting the Nazi Party.&lt;ref name="Robert Anthony Krieg 2004. p. 4"/&gt;

Historian [[Michael Burleigh]] claims that Nazism used Christianity for political purposes, but such use required that "fundamental tenets were stripped out, but the remaining diffuse religious emotionality had its uses".&lt;ref name="Roger Griffin 2005. p. 85"/&gt; Burleigh claims that Nazism's conception of spirituality was "self-consciously pagan and primitive".&lt;ref name="Roger Griffin 2005. p. 85"/&gt; However, historian [[Roger Griffin]] rejects the claim that Nazism was primarily pagan, noting that although there were some influential neo-paganists in the Nazi Party, such as [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]], they represented a minority and their views did not influence Nazi ideology beyond its use for symbolism. It is noted that Hitler denounced Germanic paganism in ''Mein Kampf'' and condemned Rosenberg's and Himmler's paganism as "nonsense".&lt;ref name="totalitarianism"/&gt;

Generally speaking, Nazi theorists and politicians blamed Germany's previous economic failures on political causes like the influence of Marxism on the workforce, the sinister and exploitative machinations of what they called international Jewry and the vindictiveness of the western political leaders' [[World War I reparations|war reparation]] demands. Instead of traditional economic incentives, the Nazis offered solutions of a political nature, such as the elimination of organised [[trade union]]s, rearmament (in contravention of the Versailles Treaty) and biological politics.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Overy, ''War and Economy in the Third Reich'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), pp. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Various work programs designed to establish full-employment for the German population were instituted once the Nazis seized full national power. Hitler encouraged nationally supported projects like the construction of the ''[[Autobahn]]'' highway system, the introduction of an affordable people's car (''[[Volkswagen Beetle|Volkswagen]]'') and later the Nazis bolstered the economy through the business and employment generated by military rearmament.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Overy, ''War and Economy in the Third Reich'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), pp. 7-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis benefited early in the regime's existence from the first post–Depression economic upswing, and this combined with their public works projects, job-procurement program and subsidised home repair program reduced unemployment by as much as 40 percent in one year. This development tempered the unfavourable psychological climate caused by the earlier economic crisis and encouraged Germans to march in step with the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Grunberger, ''The 12-Year Reich: A Social History of Nazi Germany, 1933-1945'' (New York: Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1971), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon being appointed Chancellor in 1933, Hitler promised measures to increase employment, protect the German currency, and promote recovery from the Great Depression. These included an agrarian settlement program, labor service, and a guarantee to maintain health care and pensions.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=37}} But above all, his priority was rearmament, and the buildup of the German military in preparation for an eventual war to conquer ''[[Lebensraum]]'' in the East.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=38}} Thus, at the beginning of his rule, Hitler said that “the future of Germany depends exclusively and only on the reconstruction of the Wehrmacht. All other tasks must cede precedence to the task of rearmament.”{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=38}} This policy was implemented immediately, with military expenditures quickly growing far larger than the civilian work-creation programs. As early as June 1933, military spending for the year was budgeted to be three times larger than the spending on all civilian work-creation measures in 1932 and 1933 combined.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=55}} Nazi Germany increased its military spending faster than any other state in peacetime, with the share of military spending rising from 1 percent to 10 percent of national income in the first two years of the regime alone.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=66}} Eventually, by 1944, it reached as high as 75 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard J., ''The Third Reich at War'' (New York: Penguin, 2008), p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of their rhetoric condemning [[big business]] prior to their rise to power, the Nazis quickly entered into a partnership with German business from as early as February 1933. That month, after being appointed Chancellor but before gaining dictatorial powers, Hitler made a personal appeal to German business leaders to help fund the Nazi Party for the crucial months that were to follow. He argued that they should support him in establishing a dictatorship because "private enterprise cannot be maintained in the age of democracy" and because democracy would allegedly lead to communism.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=99}} He promised to destroy the German left and the trade unions, without any mention of anti-Jewish policies or foreign conquests.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=100}} In the following weeks, the Nazi Party received contributions from seventeen different business groups, with the largest coming from [[IG Farben]] and [[Deutsche Bank]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=100}} Historian Adam Tooze writes that the leaders of German business were therefore "willing partners in the destruction of political pluralism in Germany."{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=101}} In exchange, owners and managers of German businesses were granted unprecedented powers to control their workforce, [[collective bargaining]] was abolished and wages were frozen at a relatively low level.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=102}} Business profits also rose very rapidly, as did corporate investment.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=114}} In addition, the Nazis [[privatisation|privatised]] public properties and public services, but at the same time they increased economic state control through regulations.&lt;ref name="guillebaud"/&gt; Hitler believed that private ownership was useful in that it encouraged creative competition and technical innovation, but insisted that it had to conform to national interests and be "productive" rather than "parasitical".&lt;ref name="R.J. Overy 2004. p. 403"/&gt; Private property rights were conditional upon following the economic priorities set by the Nazi leadership, with high profits as a reward for firms who followed them and the threat of nationalization being used against those who did not.&lt;ref name=economic573/&gt; Under Nazi economics, free competition and self-regulating markets diminished, but Hitler's [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] beliefs made him retain business competition and private property as economic engines.&lt;ref name="economics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="university28"/&gt;

Agrarian policies were also important to the Nazis since they corresponded not just to the economy but to their geopolitical conception of ''Lebensraum'' as well. For Hitler, the acquisition of land and soil was requisite in moulding the German economy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution'' (New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press, 2008), pp. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt; To tie farmers to their land, selling agricultural land was prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Scheck, ''Germany, 1871-1945: A Concise History'', p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Farm ownership remained private, but business monopoly rights were granted to marketing boards to control production and prices with a quota system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Primacy of Politics: Social Democracy and the Making of Europe's Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNV5uVCQnq8C&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=146 |first=Sheri |last=Berman |page=146 |isbn=978-0521521109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Hereditary Farm Law of 1933" established a cartel structure under a government body known as the [[Reichsnährstand]] (RNST) which determined "everything from what seeds and fertilizers were used to how land was inherited".&lt;ref&gt;Sheri Berman, ''The Primacy of Politics: Social Democracy and the Making of Europe's Twentieth Century,'' Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis were hostile to the idea of [[social welfare]] in principle, upholding instead the social Darwinist concept that the weak and feeble should perish.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=483-484}} They condemned the welfare system of the Weimar Republic as well as private charity, accusing them of supporting people regarded as racially inferior and weak, who should have been weeded out in the process of natural selection.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=484}} Nevertheless, faced with the mass unemployment and poverty of the Great Depression, the Nazis found it necessary to set up charitable institutions to help racially-pure Germans in order to maintain popular support, while arguing that this represented "racial self-help" and not indiscriminate charity or universal social welfare.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=484-485}} Thus, Nazi programs such as the [[Winterhilfswerk|Winter Relief of the German People]] and the broader [[Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt|National Socialist People's Welfare]] (NSV) were organized as quasi-private institutions, officially relying on private donations from Germans to help others of their race - although in practice those who refused to donate could face severe consequences.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=486-487}} Unlike the social welfare institutions of the Weimar Republic and the Christian charities, the NSV distributed assistance on explicitly racial grounds. It provided support only to those who were "racially sound, capable of and willing to work, politically reliable, and willing and able to reproduce." Non-Aryans were excluded, as well as the "work-shy", "asocials" and the "hereditarily ill."{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=489}} Successful efforts were made to get middle-class women involved in social work assisting large families,&lt;ref name="Grunberger46"/&gt; and the Winter Relief campaigns acted as a ritual to generate public sympathy.&lt;ref name="Richard Grunberger p 79"&gt;Richard Grunberger, ''The 12-Year Reich'', p. 79, {{ISBN|003-076435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler primarily viewed the German economy as an instrument of power and believed the economy was not about creating wealth and technical progress so as to improve the quality of life for a nation's citizenry, but rather that economic success was paramount for providing the means and material foundations necessary for military conquest.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Overy, ''War and Economy in the Third Reich'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), pp. 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt; While economic progress generated by National Socialist programs had its role in appeasing the German people, the Nazis and Hitler in particular did not believe that economic solutions alone were sufficient to thrust Germany onto the stage as a world power. The Nazis thus sought to secure a general economic revival accompanied by massive military spending for rearmament, especially later through the implementation of the [[Four Year Plan]], which consolidated their rule and firmly secured a command relationship between the German arms industry and the National Socialist government.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Hildebrand, ''The Third Reich'' (London &amp; New York: Routledge, 1986), pp. 39-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1933 and 1939, military expenditures were upwards of 82 billion Reichsmarks and represented 23 percent of Germany's gross national product as the Nazis mobilised their people and economy for war.&lt;ref&gt;Jost Dülffer, ''Nazi Germany 1933-1945: Faith and Annihilation'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anti-communism====
The Nazis claimed that communism was dangerous to the well-being of nations because of its intention to dissolve [[private property]], its support of [[class conflict]], its aggression against the [[middle class]], its hostility towards small business and its [[atheism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt; Nazism rejected class conflict-based socialism and [[economic egalitarianism]], favouring instead a [[Social stratification|stratified]] economy with [[social class]]es based on merit and talent, retaining [[private property]] and the creation of national solidarity that transcends class distinction.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; Historians [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Joachim Fest]] argue that in post–[[World War I]] Germany, the Nazis were one of many nationalist and fascist political parties contending for the leadership of Germany's [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] movement.

In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler stated his desire to "make war upon the Marxist principle that all men are equal."&lt;ref&gt;Hitler, Adolf, ''Mein Kampf'', Hurst and Blackett ltd., 1939. p.343&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that "the notion of equality was a sin against nature."{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=51}} Nazism upheld the "natural inequality of men," including inequality between races and also within each race.{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=49}} The National Socialist state aimed to advance those individuals with special talents or intelligence, so they could rule over the masses.{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=49}} Nazi ideology relied on elitism and the ''[[Führerprinzip]]'' (leadership principle), arguing that elite minorities should assume leadership roles over the majority, and that the elite minority should itself be organized according to a "hierarchy of talent," with a single leader - the [[Führer]] - at the top.{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=49-50}} The ''Führerprinzip'' held that each member of the hierarchy owed absolute obedience to those above him and should hold absolute power over those below him.{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=50}}

During the 1920s, Hitler urged disparate Nazi factions to unite in opposition to [[Jewish Bolshevism]].&lt;ref name="Adolf Hitler"/&gt; Hitler asserted that the "three vices" of "Jewish Marxism" were democracy, [[pacifism]] and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]].&lt;ref name="Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution"/&gt; The Communist movement, the trade unions, the Social Democratic Party and the left-wing press were all considered to be Jewish-controlled and part of the "international Jewish conspiracy" to weaken the German nation by promoting internal disunity through class struggle.{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=50}} The Nazis also believed that the Jews had instigated the [[Bolshevik revolution]] in Russia and that Communists had [[Stab-in-the-back myth|stabbed Germany in the back]] and caused it to lose the First World War.{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=52}} They further argued that modern cultural trends of the 1920s (such as [[jazz|jazz music]] and [[cubism|cubist art]]) represented "[[cultural Marxism|cultural Bolshevism]]" and were part of a political assault aimed at the spiritual degeneration of the German ''Volk''.{{sfn|Bendersky|1985|pp=52}} Joseph Goebbels published a pamphlet titled ''The Nazi-Sozi'' which gave brief points of how National Socialism differed from Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nazi-Sozi|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/nazi-sozi.htm|trans-title=Joseph Goebbels, Der Nazi-Sozi (Elberfeld: Verlag der Nationalsozialistischen Briefe, 1927).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Hitler said: "Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxist Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true Socialism is not".&lt;ref name="university29"/&gt;

The [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) was the largest Communist Party in the world outside of the Soviet Union, until it was destroyed by the Nazis in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;David Nicholls. ''Adolf Hitler: A Biographical Companion''. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2000. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s and early 30s, Communists and Nazis often fought each other directly in street violence, with the Nazi paramilitary organizations being opposed by the Communist [[Roter Frontkämpferbund|Red Front]] and [[Antifaschistische Aktion#1930s|Anti-Fascist Action]]. After the beginning of the Great Depression, both Communists and Nazis saw their share of the vote increase. However, while the Nazis were willing to form alliances with other parties of the right, the Communists refused to form an alliance with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], the largest party of the left.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Fowkes. ''Communism in Germany under the Weimar Republic''. St. Martin's Press, New York, 1984. p. 166-167&lt;/ref&gt; After the Nazis came to power, they quickly banned the Communist Party under the allegation that it was preparing for revolution and that it had caused the [[Reichstag fire]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Fowkes. ''Communism in Germany under the Weimar Republic''. St. Martin's Press, New York, 1984. p. 170-171&lt;/ref&gt; Four thousand KPD officials were arrested in February 1933, and by the end of the year 130,000 communists had been sent to concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Fowkes. ''Communism in Germany under the Weimar Republic''. St. Martin's Press, New York, 1984. p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1930s and the 1940s, anti-communist regimes and groups that supported Nazism included the [[Falange]] in [[Spain]], the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] and the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)]] in France and the [[British Union of Fascists]] under [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]].&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

====Anti-capitalism====
The Nazis argued that [[free market]] [[capitalism]] damages nations due to [[international finance]] and the worldwide economic dominance of disloyal [[big business]], which they considered to be the product of Jewish influences.&lt;ref name="autogenerated20"/&gt; Nazi propaganda posters in [[working class]] districts emphasised anti-capitalism, such as one that said: "The maintenance of a rotten industrial system has nothing to do with nationalism. I can love Germany and hate capitalism".&lt;ref name="publishers30"/&gt;

Both in public and in private, Hitler expressed disdain for capitalism, arguing that it holds nations ransom in the interests of a parasitic [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] [[rentier capitalism|rentier]] class.&lt;ref name="R.J. Overy 2004. p. 399"/&gt; He opposed free market capitalism because it "could not be trusted to put national interests first," and he desired an economy that would direct resources "in ways that matched the many national goals of the regime," such as the buildup of the military, building programs for cities and roads, and economic self-sufficiency.&lt;ref name="R.J. Overy 2004. p. 403"/&gt; Hitler also distrusted capitalism for being unreliable due to its [[egotism]] and he preferred a state-directed economy that maintains private property and competition but subordinates them to the interests of the ''[[Volk]]''.&lt;ref name="R.J. Overy 2004. p. 399" /&gt;

Hitler told a party leader in 1934: "The economic system of our day is the creation of the Jews".&lt;ref name="R.J. Overy 2004. p. 399" /&gt; Hitler said to [[Benito Mussolini]] that capitalism had "run its course".&lt;ref name="R.J. Overy 2004. p. 399"/&gt; Hitler also said that the business [[bourgeoisie]] "know nothing except their profit. 'Fatherland' is only a word for them."&lt;ref name="dictators"/&gt; Hitler was personally disgusted with the ruling bourgeois elites of Germany during the period of the Weimar Republic, who he referred to as "cowardly shits".&lt;ref&gt;Kritika: explorations in Russian and Eurasian history, Volume 7, Issue 4. Slavica Publishers, 2006. Pp. 922.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler effectively supported [[mercantilism]] in the belief that economic resources from their respective territories should be seized by force, as he believed that the policy of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' would provide Germany with such economically valuable territories.&lt;ref name="R.J. Overy 2004. p. 402"/&gt; Hitler argued that the only means to maintain economic security was to have direct control over resources rather than being forced to rely on world trade.&lt;ref name="R.J. Overy 2004. p. 402"/&gt; He claimed that war to gain such resources was the only means to surpass the failing capitalist economic system.&lt;ref name="R.J. Overy 2004. p. 402"/&gt;

[[Joseph Goebbels]], who would later go on to become the Nazi Propaganda Minister, was strongly opposed to both capitalism and communism, viewing them as the "two great pillars of materialism" that were "part of the international Jewish conspiracy for world domination."&lt;ref&gt;Read, Anthony, ''The Devil's Disciples: Hitler's Inner Circle'', 1st American ed. New York, New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2004. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he wrote in his diary in 1925 that if he were forced to choose between them, "in the final analysis", "it would be better for us to go down with Bolshevism than live in eternal slavery under capitalism".&lt;ref name="disciples"/&gt; He also linked his anti-Semitism to his anti-capitalism, stating in a 1929 pamphlet that "we see, in the Hebrews, the incarnation of capitalism, the misuse of the nation's goods."&lt;ref name="thosedamnednazis"/&gt;

Within the Nazi Party, the faction associated with anti-capitalist beliefs was the [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA), a paramilitary wing led by [[Ernst Röhm]]. The SA had a complicated relationship with the rest of the party, giving both Röhm himself and local SA leaders significant autonomy.{{sfn|Nyomarkay|1967|p=110-111}} Different local leaders would even promote different political ideas in their units, including "nationalistic, socialistic, anti-Semitic, racist, völkisch, or conservative ideas."{{sfn|Nyomarkay|1967|p=113}} There was tension between the SA and Hitler, especially from 1930 onward, as Hitler's "increasingly close association with big industrial interests and traditional rightist forces" caused many in the SA to distrust him.{{sfn|Nyomarkay|1967|p=119}} The SA regarded Hitler's seizure of power in 1933 as a "first revolution" against the left, and some voices within the ranks began arguing for a "second revolution" against the right.{{sfn|Nyomarkay|1967|p=123-124}} After engaging in violence against the left in 1933, Röhm's SA also began attacks against individuals deemed to be associated with conservative reaction.{{sfn|Nyomarkay|1967|p=123-124;130}} Hitler saw Röhm's independent actions as violating and possibly threatening his leadership, as well as jeopardising the regime by alienating the conservative President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and the conservative-oriented German Army.&lt;ref name=Nyomarkay1967_133/&gt; This resulted in Hitler purging Röhm and other radical members of the SA in 1934, during the [[Night of the Long Knives]].&lt;ref name=Nyomarkay1967_133/&gt;

===Totalitarianism===
{{See also|Totalitarianism}}
Under Nazism, with its emphasis on the nation, individualism was denounced and instead importance was placed upon Germans belonging to the German ''[[Volk]]'' and [[Volksgemeinschaft#Nazi Volksgemeinschaft|"people's community"]] (''Volksgemeinschaft)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mosse|first=George Lachmann|title=Nazi Culture: Intellectual, Cultural and Social Life in the Third Reich|year=1966|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-19304-1|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler declared that "every activity and every need of every individual will be regulated by the collectivity represented by the party" and that "there are no longer any free realms in which the individual belongs to himself".&lt;ref name="Fest"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjDrszaNTygC&amp;pg=PA418&amp;dq=%22individual's+entire+life%22+hitler&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=04gXUro4477RBbXUgEg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22individual's%20entire%20life%22%20hitler&amp;f=false|title=Hitler|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|author=Fest, Joachim|pages=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Himmler]] justified the establishment of a repressive police state, in which the security forces could exercise power arbitrarily, by claiming that national security and order should take precedence over the needs of the individual.&lt;ref name="Browder"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Syyy2MtOrcsC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=individual+needs+nazism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tIQXUtC3CPKg0wWWwYBo&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=individual%20needs%20nazism&amp;f=false|title=Foundations of the Nazi Police State: The Formation of Sipo and SD|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|author=Browder, George C|pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the famous philosopher and political theorist, [[Hannah Arendt]], the allure of Nazism as a totalitarian ideology (with its attendant mobilisation of the German population) resided within the construct of helping that society deal with the cognitive dissonance resultant from the tragic interruption of the First World War and the economic and material suffering consequent to the Depression and brought to order the revolutionary unrest occurring all around them. Instead of the plurality that existed in democratic or parliamentary states, Nazism as a totalitarian system promulgated "clear" solutions to the historical problems faced by Germany, levied support by de-legitimizing the former government of Weimar and provided a politico-biological pathway to a better future, one free from the uncertainty of the past. It was the atomised and disaffected masses that Hitler and the party elite pointed in a particular direction and using clever propaganda to make them into ideological adherents, exploited in bringing Nazism to life.&lt;ref&gt;See: Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (Orlando, FL: Harcourt Inc., 1973), pp. 305–459.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While the ideologues of Nazism, [[Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism|much like those of Stalinism]], abhorred democratic or parliamentary governance as practiced in the United States or Britain, their differences are substantial. An epistemic crisis occurs when one tries to synthesize and contrast Nazism and Stalinism as two-sides of the same coin with their similarly tyrannical leaders, state-controlled economies and repressive police structures. Namely, while they share a common thematic political construction, they are entirely inimical to one another in their worldviews and when more carefully analysed against one another on a one-to-one level, an "irreconcilable asymmetry" results.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Geyer and Sheila Fitzpatrick, eds., "Introduction – After Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared", in ''Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactionary or revolutionary?==
Although Nazism is often seen as a reactionary movement, it did not seek a return of Germany to the pre-Weimar monarchy, but instead looked much further back to a mythic halcyon Germany which never existed. It has also been seen &amp;ndash; as it was by the German-American scholar [[Franz Leopold Neumann]] &amp;ndash; as the result of a crisis of [[capitalism]] which manifested as a "totalitarian monopoly capitalism". In this view Nazism is a mass movement of the middle class which was in opposition to a mass movement of workers in [[socialism]] and its extreme form, [[Communism]].{{sfn|Bracher|1970|pp=19-20}} Historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], however, argues that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Such an interpretation runs the risk of misjudging the revolutionary component of National Socialism, which cannot be dismissed as being simply reactionary. Rather, from the very outset, and particularly as it developed into the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] state, National Socialism aimed at a transformation of state and society.{{sfn|Bracher|1970|pp=19-20}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and that, Hitler's and the Nazi Party's political positions

&lt;blockquote&gt;were of a revolutionary nature: destruction of existing political and social structures and their supporting elites; profound dispain for civic order, for human and moral values, for Habsburg and Hohenzollern, for liberal and Marxist ideas. The middle class and middle-class values, bourgeois nationalism and capitalism, the professionals, the intelligentsia and the upper class were dealt the sharpest rebuff.  These were the groups which had to be uprooted...{{sfn|Bracher|1970|pp=165}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the failure of the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923, and his subsequent trial and imprisonment, Hitler decided that the way for the Nazi Party to achieve power was not through insurrection, but through legal and quasi-legal means.  This did not sit well with the brown-shirted stormtroopers of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], especially those in Berlin, who chafed under the restrictions that Hitler placed on them, and their subordination to the party.  This resulted in the [[Stennes Revolt]] of 1930-31, after which Hitler made himself the Supreme Commander of the SA, and brought [[Ernst Röhm]] back to be their Chief of Staff and keep them in line. The quashing of the SA's revolutionary fervor convinced many businessmen and military leaders that the Nazis had put aside their insurrectionist past, and that Hitler could be a reliable partner  {{sfn|Bracher|1970|pp=231-32}}{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=274}}

However, after the Nazis' [[Machtergreifung|"Seizure of Power"]] in 1933, Röhm and the Brown Shirts were not content for the party to simply carry the reigns of power.  Instead, they pressed for a continuation of the "National Socialist revolution" to bring about sweeping social changes, which Hitler, primarily for tactical reasons, was not willing to do at that time.  He was instead focused on rebuilding the military and reorienting the economy to provide the rearmament necessary for invasion of the countries to the east of Germany, especially Poland and Russia, to get the ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space") he believed was necessary to the survival of the Aryan race. For this, he needed the co-operation of not only the military, but also the vital organs of capitalism, the banks and big businesses, which he would be unlikely to get if Germany's social and economic structure was being radically overhauled.  Röhm's public proclamation that the SA would not allow the "German Revolution" to be halted or undermined caused Hitler to announce that "The revolution is not a permanent condition."  The unwillingness of Röhm and the SA to cease their agitation for a "Second Revolution", and the unwarranted fear of a "Röhm putsch" to accomplish it, were factors behind Hitler's purging of the SA leadership in the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in July 1934.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=501-503}}{{sfn|Bracher|1970|pp=300-02}}

Despite such tactical breaks necessitated by pragmatic concerns, which were typical for Hitler during his rise to power and in the early years of his regime, Hitler never ceased being a revolutionary dedicated to the radical transformation of Germany, especially when it concerned racial matters. In his monograph, ''Hitler: Study of a Revolutionary?'', [[Martyn Housden]] concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Hitler] compiled a most extensive set of revolutionary goals (calling for radical social and political change); he mobilized a revolutionary following so extensive and powerful that many of his aims were achieved; he established and ran a dictatorial revolutionary state; and he disseminated his ideas abroad through a revolutionary foreign policy and war.  In short, he defined and controlled the National Socialist revolution in all its phases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martyn Housden|Housden, Martyn]] (2000) ''Hitler: Study of a Revolutionary?''. New York: Routledge. p.193. {{isbn|0-415-16359-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course, there were aspects of Nazism which were reactionary, such as their attitude toward the role of women in society, which was completely traditionalist,{{sfn|Bracher|1970|p=179}} calling for the return of women to the home as wives, mothers and homemakers, although ironically this ideological policy was undermined in reality by the growing labor shortages and need for more workers. The number of women in the workplace climbed throughout the period of Nazi control of Germany, from 4.24 million in 1933 to 4.52 million in 1936 and 5.2 million in 1938, numbers that far exceeded those of the [[Weimar Republic]].{{sfn|Bracher|1970|pp=421-22}}

Another reactionary aspect of Nazism was in their arts policy, which stemmed from Hitler's rejection of all forms of [[degenerate art|"degenerate"]] [[modern art]], [[20th century classical music|music]] and [[Modern architecture|architecture]].{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=82}} Overall, however, Nazism &amp;ndash; being the ideology and practices of the Nazi Party, and the Nazi Party being the manifestation of Hitler's will{{sfn|Bracher|1970|p=191}}  &amp;ndash; is best seen as essentially revolutionary in nature.

==Post-war Nazism==
{{Main|Neo-Nazism}}
Following [[End of World War II in Europe|Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II]] and the end of [[the Holocaust]], overt expressions of support for Nazi ideas were prohibited in Germany and other European countries. Nonetheless, movements which self-identify as National Socialist or which are described as adhering to National Socialism continue to exist on the fringes of politics in many western societies. Usually espousing a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] [[ideology]], many deliberately adopt the symbols of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blamires|first=Cyprian P.|editor1-last=Blamires|editor1-first=C.

Wallmann writes: "The assertion that Luther's expressions of anti-Jewish sentiment have been of major and persistent influence in the centuries after the Reformation, and that there exists a continuity between Protestant anti-Judaism and modern racially oriented anti-Semitism, is at present wide-spread in the literature; since the Second World War it has understandably become the prevailing opinion." * Michael, Robert.

Hillerbrand writes: "[H]is strident pronouncements against the Jews, especially toward the end of his life, have raised the question of whether Luther significantly encouraged the development of German anti-Semitism. Although many scholars have taken this view, this perspective puts far too much emphasis on Luther and not enough on the larger peculiarities of German history."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nomarchs''' ([[Ancient Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]]: ''heri-tep a'a''; {{lang-gr|νομάρχης}}, ''nomarchēs'') were [[Ancient Egypt]]ian administration officials responsible for the provinces. Effectively serving as provincial governors, they each held authority over one of the 42 [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] (Egyptian: ''sepat'', Greek: νομός, ''nomos'') into which the country was divided. ''Nome'' is derived from the Greek ''nomos'', meaning a province or district, and ''nomarch'' is derived from the Greek title ''nomarches'', the ruler of a ''nomos''.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Grimal, ''A History of Ancient Egypt'', Blackwell Books: 1992, pp.142 &amp; 400&lt;/ref&gt;

The division of the kingdom into nomes can be documented as far back as the reign of [[Djoser]] of the [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]] in the early [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], c. 2670 BCE, and probably harks even further back to the [[Prehistoric Egypt|Predynastic kingdoms]] of the Nile valley. The earliest topographical lists of the nomes of Upper and Lower Egypt date back to the reign of [[Nyuserre Ini]], of the mid [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]], from which time the nomarchs no longer lived at royal capital but stayed in their nomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altenmüller|first=Hartwig|author-link=Hartwig Altenmüller|chapter=Old Kingdom: Fifth Dynasty|editor-last=Redford|editor-first=Donald B.|editor-link=Donald B. Redford|year=2001|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, Volume 2|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510234-5|p=597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of the nomarchs grew with the reforms of Nyuserre's second successor, [[Djedkare Isesi]], which effectively decentralized the Egyptian state. The post of nomarch then quickly became hereditary, thereby creating a virtual feudal system where local allegiances slowly superseded obedience to the pharaoh. Less than 200 years after Djedkare's reign, the nomarchs had become the all-powerful heads of the provinces. At the dawn of the [[First Intermediate Period]], the power of the pharaohs of the [[Eighth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighth Dynasty]] had diminished to the extent that they [[Coptos Decrees|owed their position]] to the most powerful nomarchs, upon whom they could only bestow titles and honours. The power of the nomarchs remained important during the later royal revival under the impulse of the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|11th Dynasty]], originally a family of Theban nomarchs. Their power diminished during the subsequent [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]], setting the stage for the apex of royal power during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].

The title of nomarch continued to be used even until the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period.
The title was also in use in [[modern Greece]] for the heads of the [[prefectures of Greece]], which were also titled ''nomos'' (pl. νομοί, ''nomoi''; νομαρχία, ''nomarchia'' also being used to refer to the area under a nomarch's purview).&lt;ref&gt;The European Union and the regions By James Barry Jones, Michael Keating [https://books.google.com/books?id=o-Dar0hl4YwC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=Nomarchis#v=onepage&amp;q=Nomarchis&amp;f=false Page 253]  {{ISBN|0-19-827999-X}}, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nominating petition''' is required in some jurisdictions, particularly in the [[United States of America]], in order for an independent or non-major-party candidate to gain [[ballot access]]. A certain number of valid signatures is typically prescribed by statute in order for the candidate to get on the ballot. Thus, it is necessary to get an overage of "raw" signatures (perhaps twice as many as the statutory requirement) in order to assure getting on the ballot, as some signatures may be illegible, incomplete, of individuals not registered to vote, or not in the candidate's electoral district, or otherwise invalid. Paid petitioners sometimes assist in gathering signatures.

The form of a nominating petition is typically prescribed by the electoral authority (e.g. a [[board of election]]) and the wording may state, for instance, "We, the qualified voters of the district in which the above candidate seeks nomination or election and of __________ signed hereunder or on the reverse side of this page, do hereby petition the above named individual to become a candidate for the office stated above in the General Election to be held on the _____ day of _____, 20__, and we do further petition that his/her name be printed upon the official ballots to be used at the election."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbe.virginia.gov/cms/documents/PetitionForm.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611202109/http://www.sbe.virginia.gov/cms/documents/PetitionForm.pdf |date=June 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA notice}}
{{Catalan-Valencian cultural domain|image=[[File:Catalan dialects-en.png|220px|expanded=language]]}}

'''Northern Catalan''' ({{lang-ca|català septentrional}}, {{IPA-ca|kətəˈla səptəntɾiuˈnal|pron}}, also known as ''rossellonès'') is a [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[dialect]] mostly spoken in [[Northern Catalonia]], but also extending in the northeast part of [[Southern Catalonia]] in a transition zone with [[Central Catalan]].

Like other Eastern Catalan dialects, unstressed {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} are realized as schwa {{IPA|[ə]}}, and {{IPA|[u]}} substitutes unstressed {{IPA|/o/}}. It is has only five stressed vowel, the smallest number of any Catalan dialect: {{IPA|/i e a o u/}}.

There are some instances of historic stressed {{IPA|/o/}} that has changed to {{IPA|/u/}}: ''canigó'' &gt; ''canigú''.

As in [[Balearic dialect]], final ''a'' is not pronounced in words ending with ''ia'' if the stress is before the penultimate [[syllable]].

Some subdialects keep the singular masculine definite article ''lo'', as in [[North-Western Catalan]] and many varieties of [[Occitan language|Occitan]].

Northern Catalan has a large body of words imported from [[French language|French]] and Occitan. It also features some grammatical forms and structures that are typical of Occitan, such as the use of a lone post-verbal ''pas'', rather than a lone preverbal ''no'' to express basic negation (Northern Catalan ''canti pas'' vs. [[Central Catalan]] ''no canto'', 'I don't sing' or 'I'm not singing'); ''pas'' is also used in some other Catalan dialects for emphasis but always with ''no'' before the verb (Central Catalan ''no canto pas'', 'I do '''not''' sing' or 'I am '''not''' singing').

{{about|the official record of debates in the New Zealand Parliament, commonly called "Hansard"|the parliamentary records of other Commonwealth countries|Hansard}}
'''''Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)''''' is the official name of the transcripts of debates in the [[New Zealand Parliament]]. New Zealand was one of the first countries to establish an independent team of ''[[Hansard]]'' reporters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.net.nz/politics/history-of-parliament/reporting-and-broadcasting Parliaments' People, NZHistory site, NZ Ministry for Culture &amp; Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; 42 years before [[Parliament of Great Britain|Westminister]]. An official record of debates has been kept continuously since 9 July 1867. Speeches made in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] between 1867 and the commencement of [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]] in 1854 were compiled in 1885 from earlier newspaper reports, and this compilation also forms part of the [[New Zealand]] ''[[Hansard]]'' record.

==History==
[[File:Cartoon_about_NZ_Parliamentary_Debates_from_NZ_Observer_12_October_1895.jpg|400px|right|NZ Observer &amp; Free Lance 1895]]
For 13 years from the establishment of the [[Parliament of New Zealand|NZ Parliament]] in [[Auckland]] in 1854 newspaper reports were the only record of what Members said in debates in the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] and the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The accuracy of these reports often depended on the political leanings of the owners of the newspaper in which they were published, and consistency of reporting was a real problem,&lt;ref name="25th anniversary"&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19310416.2.46? Evening Post, 16 April 1931, page 11]&lt;/ref&gt; as noted in an article in the ''Wellington Independent'' newspaper in 1860:&lt;ref&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WI18601009.2.11 Wellington Independent, 9 October 1860, page 3]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“''These reports give you little notion of the reality. Some members … whose speeches are dreary beyond belief, and almost unintelligible as delivered in the House, [become] flowing oratory in the columns of the newspaper.  While others… are shorn of their fair proportions, and their speeches reduced to mere notes… Members who usually talk to empty benches [appear] as prominent as those who electrify the gallery or are the life of the House.''”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[MPs|MP]] [[William Fitzherbert (New Zealand politician)|William Fitzherbert]] brought a motion to the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House]] in 1856 calling for funds to be applied to "''secure accurate and authentic reports of the substance and arguments of the speeches''".&lt;ref name="12 June 1856"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.32106019740189;view=1up;seq=202 ''Parliamentary Debates 1856–1858'', 12 June 1856, page 152]&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1862 [[James FitzGerald (New Zealand politician)|James FitzGerald]] ([[MPs|MP]] for Christchurch and owner of ''[[The Press]]'') introduced a motion calling on the Government to take steps to secure the publication of "''full and accurate reports of the debates in this House''".&lt;ref name="25 August 1862"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.32106019740205;view=1up;seq=672 ''Parliamentary Debates 1861–1863'', 25 August 1862, page 606]&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite both motions being unanimously agreed, it was not until 1866 that a Select Committee, chaired by [[James FitzGerald (New Zealand politician)|FitzGerald]], was established to “''consider and report as to the best manner in which the debates of the General Assembly can be reported and printed''.”&lt;ref name="5 July 1866"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.32106019740213;view=1up;seq=833 ''Parliamentary Debates 1864–1866'', 5 July 1866, page 761]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July 1867 a team of five reporters (AJ Dallas, George McIntyre, James Kinsella, ET Gillon, and William Mitchell who later drowned&lt;ref&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS18980624.2.54 Auckland Star, 24 June 1898, page 5]&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DSC18671014.2.26?

Barron]], produced the first official report of debates of the [[Parliament of New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18920711.2.10 [[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|Evening Post]], 11 July 1892, page 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18880709.2.8 [[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|Evening Post]], 9 July 1888, page 2]&lt;/ref&gt; One notable ''Hansard'' Reporter from the 1870s and 1880s was [[George Fisher (New Zealand politician)|George Fisher]], who was mayor of [[Wellington]] for four terms, member of Parliament for Wellington and Minister of Education and Commissioner of Trade and Customs.&lt;ref name="25th anniversary"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="shorthand"&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/ODT18840403.2.36 Otago Daily Times, 3 April 1884, page 4]&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable early ''Hansard'' Reporter was Charles Melville Crombie, who later became Chief Commissioner of Taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18940607.2.11 Evening Post, 7 June 1894, page 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cartoon_about_NZ_Parliamentary_Debates_from_NZ_Observer_25_Aug._1894.jpg|400px|right|NZ Observer &amp; Free Lance 1894]]
Reporters worked in 15 minute "turns" and had to cover speeches in both debating chambers, regularly working until after midnight to finish the day's reports, taking notes using [[Pitman shorthand]] and then transcribing these by dictation.&lt;ref name ="shorthand"/&gt; From the establishment of the ''Hansard'' team speeches were reported as fully as possible, although for many years it was regularly proposed that only summaries of speeches should be published.&lt;ref&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18880709.2.8? Evening Post, 9 July 1888, page 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Reporters had to cope with speakers who had a variety of different accents and speaking pace, and had to learn the names of an increasing number of members, with the [[New Zealand House of Representatives#Number of members|number of members]] in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House]] alone increasing from 37 in 1854 to 95 by 1882. Competent reporters with [[shorthand]] skills were scarce in New Zealand and men were brought in during parliamentary sessions from Australian parliaments to assist local reporters.

In 1884 Maurice FitzGerald, son of [[James FitzGerald (New Zealand politician)|James FitzGerald]], was engaged to compile from newspaper reports speeches made in Parliament between 1854 and 1867.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18841108.2.12 Evening Post, 8 November 1884, page 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/HBH18841110.2.12.1 Hawke's Bay Herald, 10 November 1884, page 3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/THD18841110.2.13 Timaru Herald, 10 November 1884, page 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/HBH18841111.2.10?

==New Zealand ''Hansard'' today==
Official transcripts of [[MPs]] speeches in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House]] have been continuously published since 1867. Today ''Hansard'' is produced by a team of about 17 [[Full-time equivalent|FTE]] Hansard Editors within the [[Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives]]. ''Hansard'' is published on the [[New Zealand Parliament]] website each day the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House]] sits, and later indexed bound volumes are produced.

Speeches are transcribed directly from digital recordings of the debate, with staff present in the [[debating chamber]] to monitor the debate by recording the sequence of speakers and any interjections. Interjections are reported only if the member speaking replies to them or remarks on them during the course of his or her speech. Hansard Editors follow strict rules on what changes they can make to the words [[MPs]] use in the [[debating chamber]]. ''Hansard'' is as close to [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] as possible, although Hansard Editors remove repetitions and redundancies and make minor grammatical corrections. [[MPs]] are provided draft copies of their speeches at the same time that the speeches are first published on the Parliament website. [[MPs]] can request correction of inadvertent factual inaccuracies but they are unable to significantly change what they said in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/what-is-hansard/ New Zealand Parliament website, "What is Hansard?", Retrieved 13 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews270420091/650th-bound-edition-of-hansard-published New Zealand Parliament website, "650th bound edition of Hansard published", Retrieved 13 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Peter Tatchell Foundation''' ('''PTF''') is an independent, non-party political organisation based in the United Kingdom and named after its director,  [[human rights]] activist [[Peter Tatchell]]. It "seeks to promote and protect the human rights of individuals, communities and nations, in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and internationally, in accordance with established national and [[international human rights law]]" and its stated aims and objectives are "to raise awareness, understanding, protection and implementation of human rights, in the UK and worldwide".&lt;ref name=PTF.org /&gt;

The organisation works with a variety of human rights issues globally, such as [[homophobia]], [[transphobia]], [[sexism]], [[gender inequality]], [[racism]], [[political freedom]], [[censorship]], [[religious discrimination]], unjust [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]], [[freedom of association]], [[capital punishment]], [[Right of asylum|asylum]] and [[refugee]]s, [[trade union]] rights, [[self-determination]] of oppressed peoples, [[torture]], [[genocide]], [[war crimes]], [[crimes against humanity]] and [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=PTF.org /&gt;

In 2012 the foundation gained funding from [[The Funding Network]] for three projects: "Casework &amp; Advice", including adding an "Advice" section to its website; "Equal Love", campaigning on same-sex marriage and opposite-sex civil partnerships; and "Olympic Equality Initiative", working against sexism and homophobia in the Olympic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Tatchell Foundation|url=http://www.thefundingnetwork.org.uk/projects/peter-tatchell-foundation-8674/|publisher=The Funding Network|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|December 2014}} the organisation is seeking charitable status.&lt;ref name=PTF.org&gt;{{cite web|title=About us | url=http://www.petertatchellfoundation.org/about|publisher=Peter Tatchell Foundation|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Foundation===
Québec solidaire was founded on February 4, 2006 in [[Montreal]] by the merger of the left-wing party [[Union des forces progressistes (Canada)|Union des forces progressistes]] (UFP) and the [[alter-globalization]] political movement [[Option Citoyenne]], led by [[Françoise David]].{{r|official_historique}} It was formed around a number of activists and politicians who had written ''[[Pour un Québec solidaire]]'', a left-wing response to ''[[Pour un Québec lucide]]''. ''Pour un Québec lucide'' presented a distinctly neoliberal analysis of and set of solutions to Quebec's problems, particularly criticizing the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereignty movement]] as distracting from Quebec's real issues and the Quebec social model as inefficient and out-of-date. ''Pour un Québec solidaire'' presented an alternate analysis, and later its writers formed the party Quebec solidaire, taking its name from the manifesto.{{r|thetyee}}

===Merger with ''Option nationale''===
On December 2, 2017, party members approved a merger with the centre-left sovereignist [[Option nationale]] party.{{r|ctv_1.3704508}} ON members approved the merger, which gave them "collective" status within Québec solidaire, on December 10.{{r|ctv_1.3715528}}

Jean-François Lisée charged Manon Massé with reneging in unsuccessful deliberations for a putative electoral alliance between the Parti Québécois and Québec Solidaire in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/quebec-election-lisee-defends-attack-on-qs&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election results===
Québec solidaire's first political venture was to field a candidate, [[Manon Massé]], in an April 10, 2006, by-election in [[Sainte-Marie–Saint-Jacques]]. She received 22% of the vote.

On August 14, 2006, there were two by-elections ([[Pointe-aux-Trembles (electoral district)|Pointe-aux-Trembles]] and [[Taillon]]) in which QS received 8% and 7% of the vote.

Québec solidaire contested the [[Quebec general election, 2007|2007 Quebec election]].  It won 3.65% of the popular vote and received 144,418 votes, 0.21% behind the Green Party of Quebec.  They were also endorsed by the Montreal Central Council of the [[Confédération des syndicats nationaux]] which represents 125,000 members in Quebec. According to an analysis on ''Canadian Dimension,'' this is the first time a trade union in Quebec has endorsed a party more left-wing than the [[Parti Québécois]].{{r|fidler}}

On December 8, 2008, the first Quebec Solidaire candidate was elected in the [[Quebec general election, 2008|provincial election]].  [[Amir Khadir]] was elected in the Montreal riding of [[Mercier (provincial electoral district)|Mercier]].{{r|cbc_20081208}} He won his seat for the second term on 2012 election along with another QS candidate Françoise David in Montreal riding of [[Gouin (provincial electoral district)|Gouin]]. [[Manon Massé]] was elected in [[Sainte-Marie–Saint-Jacques]] in the [[Quebec general election, 2014|2014 election]] to become the party's third MNA, joining David and Khadir who were both re-elected. In the [[Quebec general election, 2018|2018 election]] the party gained 7 more seats from former [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] and Parti Québécois (while also tying the latter in terms of total seats won) ridings after [[Coalition Avenir Québec]], an Autonomous party won the majority of seats.

The aim of QS's foundation was to unify the sovereigntist left of the political spectrum in [[Quebec]] by merging the [[Union des forces progressistes (Canada)|Union des forces progressistes]] (UFP) party with the [[Option citoyenne]] social movement.&lt;ref name="Bargiela-Chiappini2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francesca Bargiela-Chiappini|title=The Handbook of Business Discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOTcr9mrtEUC&amp;pg=PA58|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2801-8|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RobichaudCooren2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Robichaud|author2=Francois Cooren|title=Organization and Organizing: Materiality, Agency and Discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vc_77LS14E0C&amp;pg=PA179|date=May 2, 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-20733-4|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to advocating the independence of Quebec from Canada, the party's platform identifies with the concepts of environmentalism, [[feminism]], [[social justice]], [[proportional representation]] and [[participatory democracy]], [[pacifism]], [[aboriginal rights]], and [[alter-globalism]].{{r|official_quisommesnous}} The party favours [[aboriginal rights]], immigration, and [[human dignity]], and opposes discrimination including racism, sexism and [[homophobia]].{{r|official_quisommesnous}}  QS describes itself as a [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]], [[Green politics|green]], [[alter-globalization]]ist, and [[Feminism|feminist]] party.&lt;ref name="TrimbleArscott2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda Trimble|author2=Jane Arscott|author3=Manon Tremblay|title=Stalled: The Representation of Women in Canadian Governments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rsvBqIXfJbYC&amp;pg=PA208|date=May 31, 2013|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-2522-1|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the left-most of the four parties presently represented in the National Assembly.

At the party's founding, the congress unanimously adopted a document called the ''Déclaration de principes'' (declaration of principles) which laid out the principles and values that led the two organizations to merge. The declaration of principles does not specifically endorse [[social democracy]], socialism or [[communism]], although it includes certain activists and tendencies that do.{{r|pcq|lagauche_manif|riposte}} The document declared:{{r|official_quisommesnous}}
* ''"Nous sommes écologistes"'' ("We are [[environmentalism|environmentalists]]")
* ''"Nous sommes de gauche"'' ("We are on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]]")
* ''"Nous sommes démocrates"'' ("We are democrats")
* ''"Nous sommes féministes"'' ("We are [[feminism|feminists]]")
* ''"Nous sommes altermondialistes"'' ("We are [[alter-globalists]]")
* ''"Nous sommes d'un Québec pluriel"'' ("We are from a plural Quebec")
* ''"Nous sommes d'un Québec souverain et solidaire"'' ("We are from a sovereign and united [''literally'': solidarity-showing] Quebec")
* ''"Un autre parti, pour un autre Québec!"'' ("Another party, for another Quebec!")

==Structure==
As with its predecessors, Québec solidaire has no "party leader". Instead, the party practices [[collective leadership]]. The party's statutes call for it to be represented by a male and female co-spokesperson, one of whom serves in the dual role of party president.  If one of the spokespeople is a member of the National Assembly, the other spokesperson remains outside of the legislature and holds the party presidency.&lt;ref name="KhadirResigns"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simard |first=Mathieu |url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/Amir+Khadir+steps+down+Qu%C3%A9bec+solidaire+spokesperson/7496353/story.html |title=Khadir steps down as Québec solidaire co-leader |publisher=[[The Canadian Press]] |date=November 4, 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are sometimes referred to in the media as the ''de facto'' co-leaders of the party.{{r|ledevoir}}

The duties generally entrusted to the leader in most other Canadian federal and provincial parties are instead divided among the president, secretary general and male and female spokespeople. The party leadership is assumed by the National Coordinating Committee, composed of 16 persons elected by the founding congress. A person from the team of volunteers will always have a seat. However, as Quebec's election laws requires the appointment of a leader, the party's secretary general, currently Gaétan Châteauneuf,{{r|dgeq}} is the ''[[de jure]]'' party leader recognized by the [[Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-quebec-party-leaders-back-on-election-campaign-trail-after-visiting/|title= Quebec party leaders back on election campaign trail after visiting tornado victims|publisher=[[The Canadian Press]]|date=September 23, 2018|accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Françoise David]] and [[Amir Khadir]] were the two spokespersons at the party's founding. After the 2012 election where Françoise David won a seat for the first time and Amir Khadir was re-elected, Khadir stepped down as co-spokesperson so a new one could be chosen from outside the legislature.&lt;ref name="KhadirResigns" /&gt; André Frappier served as interim co-spokesperson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simard |first=Mathieu |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2012/12/02/montreal-frappier-solidaire.html |title=Québec Solidaire elects interim co-spokesman |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=December 2, 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; until [[Andrés Fontecilla]] was chosen on May 5, 2013 to permanently fill the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/politique-quebecoise/201305/05/01-4647742-quebec-solidaire-choisit-andres-fontecilla-comme-porte-parole.php |title=Québec solidaire choisit Andrés Fontecilla comme porte-parole |publisher=[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]] |date=May 5, 2013 |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois]] and [[Manon Massé]] became the current co-spokespersons of the party on May 21, 2017. [[Alexa Conradi]] was president from the foundation of the party until June 2009 after which Françoise David was named president-spokeswoman.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The national spokespersons of Québec solidaire have greater visibility than the secretary general and are best known. David has been named Personality of the Year by ''[[Le Point]]'' and Khadir is known for becoming the first elected member of the party, winning the provincial riding of [[Mercier (provincial electoral district)|Mercier]] in 2008.

The basic unit of the party is the local association. There is a local association for each of the 125 ridings in Quebec. These local associations are grouped into 19 regional associations, whose primary mandate to support the establishment of local associations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In March 2007, Québec solidaire has 61 local associations organized. Students and staff at institutions of higher education are grouped in campus associations that also participate in the democratic life of the party.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Two national commissions are also part of the structure of Québec solidaire: the Political Committee and the National Commission for Women. The first is composed of 14 thematic committees and is responsible for proposing a program to members. It was responsible for drafting the electoral platform of the party in general elections of 2007. The National Commission for Women is composed of delegates from each region and is responsible for ensuring that feminism is a value which transverses the party.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Québec solidaire also includes a number of collectives, made up of members in good standing who may, in compliance with requirements, promote their respective political views within Québec solidaire. Unlike the UFP, these groups do not have formal representation in the Congress, the National Council or other bodies of the party.{{r|official_statuts}} Current collectives include:

* ''[[Socialist Alternative (Quebec)|Alternative socialiste]]'', the Quebec section of the [[Committee for a Workers' International]].{{r|alternativesocialiste}}
* ''Décroissance conviviale'', a collective which promotes [[degrowth]].
* ''[[Gauche Socialiste]]'', the Quebec section of the [[reunified Fourth International]].{{r|lagauche}}
* ''Laïcité'', a collective which promotes the [[separation of church and state]].
* ''Mass critique'', an [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] collective.
* ''Socialisme Internationale'', the Quebec membership of the [[International Socialists (Canada)|International Socialists]].{{r|socialiste}}
* ''Tendance Marxiste Internationale'', the Quebec section of the [[International Marxist Tendency]].{{r|riposte_200909}}
* ''[[Option nationale]]'',  formerly active as a separate electoral party from 2011 to 2017.

The ''[[Communist Party of Quebec|Parti Communiste du Québec – Parti Communiste du Canada]]'' (PCQ-PCC), left QS following its merger with Option nationale in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://particommunisteduquebec.ca/sur-quebec-solidaire/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2778">The '''Reichsabgabe''' was a [[tax]] on the postal traffic, levied in the [[German Empire]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. It was introduced to finance the war expenses. The tax was announced in the ‘Tariff Law’ (''Gebührengesetz'') of 21 June 1916 and became effective with the new postal rates of 1 August 1916.

In practice the Reichsabgabe meant a raising of the postal rates, the revenues of which streamed into the treasury of the State instead of the treasury of the ''Deutsche [[Reichspost]]'', the German postal service. The increase of the postal rates was confined to domestic letters and [[postcard]]s; international mail and [[printed matter]]s were excepted.

On 1 October 1918 the Reichsabgabe was raised. Now the printed matter rate was not excepted.

The effects of the Reichsabgabe are illustrated in the following table:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|+
! '''Postal item''' || '''From 1906-07-01''' || '''From 1916-08-01''' || '''From 1918-10-01'''
|-
| local letter || 5 Pfennig || 7½ Pfennig || 10 Pfennig
|-
| local postcard || 5 Pfennig || 7½ Pfennig || 7½ Pfennig
|-
| inland letter up to 20 g. || 10 Pfennig || 15 Pfennig || 15 Pfennig
|-
| inland postcard || 5 Pfennig || 7½ Pfennig || 10 Pfennig
|-
| inland printed matter up to 50 g. || 3 Pfennig || 3 Pfennig || 5 Pfennig
|-
| international letter up to 20 g. || 20 Pfennig || 20 Pfennig || 20 Pfennig
|-
| international postcard || 10 Pfennig || 10 Pfennig || 10 Pfennig
|}

Apart from Germany the Reichsabgabe also applied to the parts of [[Poland]] and the [[Russian Empire]] occupied by Germany and to the occupied  Grand Duchy of [[Luxembourg]], but not to the occupied part of [[Belgium]].

The Reichsabgabe was ended on 1 October 1919 in conformance to a law of 8 September 1919. However, the raisings of the postal rates were not reversed.

The '''Representation of Natives Act''' No 12 of 1936 (commenced 10 July) was legislation passed in South Africa which further reduced black rights at the time.&lt;ref name="Loveland1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Loveland|title=By Due Process of Law: Racial Discrimination and the Right to Vote in South Africa 1855-1960|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h7u_SUxHpzwC&amp;dq=Representation+of+Natives+Act,+1936&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|year=1999|publisher=Hart Publishing|isbn=978-0-313-29879-0|pages=197–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Cape province had a qualified franchise which had allowed a small number of blacks in the Cape to vote for the common roll (although not to sit in parliament) in terms of the [[Cape Qualified Franchise]]. The qualified franchise dated back to the pre-Union period, when the Cape was a separate British colony; it also excluded poorer white men. The 1936 Act removed blacks to  a separate roll – and halted the right to run for office; other earlier legislation removed the qualifications imposed in the Cape on whites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/representation-natives-act-passed&lt;/ref&gt;

With this act, the small black elite - most blacks never had the vote - were removed from the common rolls on which they had been able to register since 1854. Chiefs, local councils, urban advisory boards and election committees in all provinces were to elect four whites to the senate by a system of block voting. The act also created a Native Representative Council of six white officials, four nominated and twelve elected Africans.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv01538/04lv01646/05lv01783.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repeal==
This Act was repealed on 19 June 1959 by the [[Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959]].&lt;ref&gt;Promotion of Bantu Self-governing Act, Act No. 46 of 1959 http://www.aluka.org/stable/10.5555/al.sff.document.leg19590619.028.020.046&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Restore Our Future''' is a [[political action committee]] (PAC) created to support [[Mitt Romney]] in the [[2012 U.S. Presidential election]]. A so-called [[Super PAC]], Restore Our Future is permitted to raise and spend unlimited amounts of corporate, union, and individual [[campaign contributions]] under the terms of the [[Citizens United v.

== Contributors ==

As of July 2012, Restore Our Future had raised more than $60 million,&lt;ref name="byo"/&gt; a large portion of which came from Wall Street contributors.&lt;ref name='NYT_2012-05-02'/&gt;

{{As of|August 2011}}, the largest individual contributor to Restore Our Future was [[John Paulson]], a billionaire and [[hedge fund]] manager who is, according to ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'', "famous for [having enriched] himself by betting on the collapse of the housing industry."&lt;ref name="politico"/&gt; An additional million dollars came from [[W Spann LLC]], a [[dummy corporation]] with no record of actual business activities.&lt;ref name="wapo-concerns"&gt;{{cite news | work = The [[Washington Post]] | title = Mystery firm’s $1M donation to pro-Romney PAC raises concern over transparency | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/short-lived-firms-1m-donation-to-gop-fund-raises-concern-over-transparency/2011/08/04/gIQAvczruI_story.html | first = Dan | last = Eggen | date = August 4, 2011 | accessdate = August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; W Spann LLC was incorporated, donated to the PAC, and then dissolved in a matter of months,&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[msnbc.com]] | url = http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/44011308/ns/politics-decision_2012/ | title = Firm gives $1 million to pro-Romney group, then dissolves | first = Michael | last = Isikoff | authorlink = Michael Isikoff | accessdate = August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[The New York Times]] | title = Donation to Romney-Tied Group Draws Scrutiny | accessdate = August 4, 2011 |authorlink=Nicholas Confessore | first = Nicholas | last = Confessore | url = http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/donation-to-romney-tied-group-draws-scrutiny/ | date = August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; attracting concern from election-watchdog groups and campaign-finance experts about the use of [[dummy corporation]]s to shield large campaign contributions from public scrutiny.&lt;ref name="wapo-concerns"/&gt;

Several watchdog groups requested that the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and [[Federal Election Commission]] investigate donations to Restore Our Future from W Spann LLC as possible violations of campaign-finance law.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Reuters]] | title = Watchdogs seek source of money to Romney backer | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/05/us-usa-campaign-finance-romney-idUSTRE7746JP20110805 | date = August 5, 2011 | accessdate = August 7, 2011 | first= Molly | last = O'Toole}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restore Our Future declined to provide additional details about the donation and asserted that it had complied with existing laws.

In response to rumors, a spokesman for [[Bain Capital]], a [[private equity firm]] previously headed by Romney, stated that W Spann LLC "is not affiliated with Bain Capital or any of our employees."&lt;ref name="wapo-concerns"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, Edward Conard, a former top executive at Bain Capital who retired in 2007, came forward to state that he had formed W Spann LLC and funded and authorized the $1 million contribution.&lt;ref name="ap-donor-id"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=  [[Associated Press]] | title = Mysterious donor to pro-Romney PAC identified | url = https://news.yahoo.com/mysterious-donor-pro-romney-pac-identified-160307460.html | date = August 6, 2011 | accessdate = August 7, 2011 | first = Jack | last = Gillum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conard requested that Restore Our Future amend its filings to reflect that he, rather than W Spann LLC, had donated the $1 million.&lt;ref name="hill-id"&gt;{{cite news | work= [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] | first = Alexander | last = Burton | url = http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/fundraising/175765-mystery-romney-supporter-reveals-himself-after-watchdog-groups-call-for-investigation | title = Mystery Romney backer reveals himself | accessdate = August 7, 2011 | date = August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poltico-id"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] | title = Mystery Mitt Romney donor comes forward | url = http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/60776.html | first = Maggie | last = Haberman | accessdate=August 7, 2011 | date = August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another entity, [[Paumanok Partners LLC]], contributed $250,000 to Restore Our Future. It has been traced back to Romney donor [[William Laverack, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="nyt-donor-id-1"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[The New York Times]]| title = THE CAUCUS; A Likely Name For a Mystery Donor | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E4DC163AF930A35751C0A9649D8B63 | first = Michael | last = Luo | accessdate=February 14, 2012 | date = February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glenbrook L.L.C.]] was originally reported as donating $250,000 in August 2011, but in an amended filing with the FEC the Glenbrook donation was replaced by two $125,000 donations by Jesse Rogers, a former executive at Bain &amp; Company.&lt;ref name="nyt-donor-id-2"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[The New York Times]]| title = A Secret Donor Revealed | url = http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/07/a-secret-donor-revealed/ | first = Michael | last = Luo | accessdate=February 14, 2012 | date = February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two additional $1 million contributions came from corporations registered to the offices of two executives of [[Nu Skin Enterprises]], a Utah-based [[multilevel marketing]] company selling skin-care products and [[dietary supplements]].&lt;ref name="politico"/&gt; Other large contributors included members of the Marriott family, hedge-fund managers, and investors in Bain Capital.&lt;ref name="politico"/&gt;

===From federal contractors===
Despite a 36-year-old ban against [[federal contractor]]s making federal political expenditures, Restore Our Future has accepted donations of $890,000 from at least five such companies, who are taking advantage of a legal gray area created by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s 2010 ruling in  [[Citizens United v. FEC]]. [[Oxbow Carbon]], a major coal and petroleum company founded by [[Bill Koch (businessman)|William Koch]] that contracts with the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], gave $750,000, and has insisted such donations are now legal. Another company, [[M.C. Dean]], a Virginia-based electrical engineering company, donated $5,000, but has asked the funds to be returned after consulting with lawyers. The other companies are: [[B/E Aerospace]], a [[U.S. Department of Defense]] contractor, which gave $50,000; [[Clinical Medical Services]], which contracts with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]], donated $25,000; and [[Suffolk Construction Co.]], which is building a [[U.S. Naval]] base, donated $60,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Iowa ad==
In December 2011, [[Glenn Kessler (journalist)|Glenn Kessler]] of the ''Washington Post'' found that a Restore ad attacking [[Newt Gingrich]] in [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2012|Iowa]] had a number of "egregious fouls" and "underhanded" treatment of [[Newt Gingrich presidential campaign, 2012#Top tier candidate|Freddie Mac]] and [[Political positions of Newt Gingrich#Abortion|abortion]] issues. The PAC had $3 million budgeted for the Iowa television campaign. Brittany Gross, a Restore spokesperson, declined to answer questions from Kessler about the ad.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, Glenn, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/romney-versus-gingrich-a-super-pacs-over-the-top-ad/2011/12/20/gIQAeJQn7O_blog.html "Romney versus Gingrich: a Super PAC’s over-the-top ad"], ''Washington Post'' Fact Checker blog, 12/21/2011 06:02 am ET. Retrieved 2011-12-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board and staffing==
Restore’s board of directors included treasurer Spies; [[Carl Forti]], political director for Governor Romney’s 2008 campaign and of [[American Crossroads]] Super PAC; and [[Larry McCarthy]], a member of Governor Romney's media team in 2008.&lt;ref name="wapo"/&gt;

Don Stirling, who was the [[2002 Winter Olympics#Bribery to bring the games to Salt Lake City|2002 Utah Olympics]]' local marketing chief and fundraiser working with Romney, worked with Restore Our Future during [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012|Governor Romney's 2012 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Rutenberg|Rutenberg, Jim]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/us/politics/support-for-romney-by-old-mormon-families.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1&amp;hp "Mormons’ First Families Rally Behind Romney"], ''The New York Times'', web p. 3, July 16, 2012.

A '''second-class citizen''' is a person who is systematically [[discrimination|discriminated]] against within a [[State (polity)|state]] or other [[Political division|political jurisdiction]], despite their nominal status as a citizen or legal resident there. While not necessarily [[slaves]], [[civil death|outlaws]] or [[criminals]], second-class citizens have limited legal rights, civil rights and socioeconomic opportunities, and are often subject to mistreatment or neglect at the hands of their putative superiors. However, they are different from "[[less-than-whole citizens]]",&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fragmented Citizens: The Changing Landscape of Gay and Lesbian Lives|last=Engel|first=Stephen|publisher=NYU Press|year=2016|isbn=1479809128|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as second-class citizens are often disregarded by the law or have it used to [[harassment|harass]] them (see [[police misconduct]] and [[racial profiling]]). Systems with ''[[de facto]]'' second-class citizenry are generally regarded as violating human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/second-class-citizen|title=the definition of second-class citizen|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/second-class%20citizen|title=Definition of SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical conditions facing second-class citizens include but are not limited to: 
* [[disenfranchisement]] (a lack or loss of voting rights) 
* limitations on [[civil service|civil]] or [[military]] service (not including [[conscription]] in every case) 
* restrictions on [[language]], [[religion]], [[education]] 
* lack of freedom of movement and association 
* limitations on weapons ownership 
* restrictions on [[marriage]] 
* restrictions on [[Gender Identity|gender identity and expression]] 
* restrictions on [[House|housing]]  
* restrictions on [[property|property ownership]]

The category is normally unofficial and mostly academic, and the term itself is generally used as a [[pejorative]] and governments will typically deny the existence of a second class within the [[polity]]. As an informal category, second-class citizenship is not objectively measured; however, cases such as the [[American South]] under [[Racial segregation|segregation]], [[Aboriginal Australians|aborigines]] in [[Australia]] prior to 1967, [[apartheid]] in [[Republic of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia|women]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] under Saudi law, [[Dalit]]s in [[India]] and [[Nepal]], and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] in [[Northern Ireland]] during the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|parliamentary]] era are all examples of groups that have been historically described as having second-class citizenry. Historically, before the mid-20th century, this policy was applied by some European [[Colonial empire|Colonial Empires]] on colonial [[Domicile (law)|residents]] of overseas holdings. 

A [[resident alien]] or [[foreign national]], and [[children]] in general, fit most definitions of second-class citizen. This does not mean that they do not have any legal protections, nor do they lack acceptance by the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/second-class-citizen|title=the definition of second-class citizen|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[naturalized]] citizen carries essentially the same rights and responsibilities as any other citizen (a possible exception being ineligibility for certain public offices), and is also legally protected.

* [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|Latvian non-citizens]] constitute a group similar to second-class citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurope.eu/article/walk-latvian|title='Walk like a Latvian'|publisher=New Europe|date=2013-06-01|accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are not considered foreigners (they hold no other citizenship, have Latvian IDs), they have reduced rights compared to full citizens. For example, non-citizens are not eligible to vote or hold public office. The [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] has described their status as making "people concerned feel like “second-class citizens”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.ecri.coe.int/XMLEcri/ENGLISH/Cycle_03/03_CbC_eng/LVA-CbC-III-2008-2-ENG.pdf Third report on Latvia.

* New Zealanders receive automatically a "[[Special Category Visa]]" upon entering Australia, which presents no pathway to Australian citizenship.  New Zealanders are denied access to [[Centrelink]], to name just one of the services.  This means that if, for example, a New Zealand person came to Australia to live with his or her Australian spouse, and that spouse committed domestic violence upon them, the New Zealander could not then turn to Centrelink to provide them with funds to leave the abusive spouse. 
* Mainland Chinese citizens who are settling in Hong Kong or Macau by means of a [[one-way permit]] do not have citizenship rights (such as obtaining a [[passport]]) in both the mainland or the SAR after settling but before obtaining the permanent resident status, effectively rendering them second-class citizens.
* [[Burakumin]] (部落民) is a designation of Japanese Second-class status meaning the people who are from a place called a "buraku." “Buraku” basically means a village or small district. For a long time, people have discriminated against people from a "buraku" even though they belong to the same [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and there are no differences between ordinary [[Japanese people|Japanese]] people and people who are called burakumin. It is not clear when and why this started, but it is said that it was most common in the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roth|first1=Louis Frédéric ; translated by Käthe|title=Japan encyclopedia|date=2005|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674017535|pages=93–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often called "eta" (穢多) or "[[hinin]]" (非人) meaning polluted or not a human.  Even though in [[Meiji 4]] (1871), this discrimination was officially ended by kaihourei ([[:ja:解放令|解放令]]), many people resisted it and continued treating them as burakumin. Today, fewer people are discriminate towards burakumin, however, the term burakumin is still recognized as a discriminating word while there are certain amount of recent young generations who do not even know the term and idea of burakumin. Also, in some cases, people still happen to be discriminated against, especially when they get a job or get married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saito (齋藤）|first1=Naoko(直子)|title=部落出身者と結婚差別|website=http://synodos.jp/society/10900}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cases often reported as problems.
* Natives of many colonized lands in the past could be considered second-class citizens compared to the colonists, however as generations pass on they become "[[Less-than-whole citizens]]" unless dramatic citizenship rights are ensured.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3474">The '''Sicilian National Movement''' ({{lang-it|Movimento Nazionale Siciliano}}, '''MNS''') is a [[separatism|separatist]] coalition of parties active in [[Sicily]].

The coalition was launced in November 2016&lt;ref&gt;http://www.movimentonazionalesiciliano.eu/manifesto&lt;/ref&gt; and officially founded in January 2017. Its three founding members were: [[Sicily Nation]] (SN), the [[Sicilian Independence Movement]] (MIS; re-edition of the separatist party which was active after [[World War II]]) and the [[Sicilian National Front]] (FNS).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/politica/12279089/sicilia-nasce-il-movimento-nazionale-siciliano-e-candida-alla-regione-gaetano-armao.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its foundation, the MNS supported [[Gaetano Armao]], SN leader, for [[President of Sicily]] in the [[Sicilian regional election, 2017|2017 regional election]].&lt;ref&gt;http://palermo.repubblica.it/dettaglio-news/-/4681510&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.secoloditalia.it/2017/02/gli-autonomisti-siciliani-contro-crocetta-e-orlando-affossano-lisola&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2017 Armao, with the support of the MNS,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.movimentonazionalesiciliano.eu/sicilianisti-armao-sicilianindignati&lt;/ref&gt; launched a broader '''Union of Indignant Sicilians''' (''Unione dei Siciliani Indignati'', USI),&lt;ref&gt;http://siciliainformazioni.com/redazione/670149/amao-e-il-suo-movimento-nazionale-siciliano-scendono-in-campo-per-il-centrodestra&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://formiche.net/blog/2017/08/20/armao-sicilia-berlusconi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2017-08-22/armao-leader-indignati-che-indigna-parte-forza-italia-134041.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; received the support of [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] (FI),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lastampa.it/2017/08/26/italia/politica/sicilia-berlusconi-decide-da-solo-punto-su-armao-e-sfido-gli-alleati-OAV1T39RcqEfVjdKjcQyVO/pagina.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lecodelsud.it/berlusconi-armao-piu-un-colpo-fulmine-musumeci-non-indietreggia&lt;/ref&gt; and was selected as candidate for Vice President, in ticket with candidate for President [[Nello Musumeci]], representing a broad centre-right coalition, notably including FI, [[Brothers of Italy]], [[Us with Salvini]], the [[Party of Sicilians]] and the [[Union of the Centre (2002)|Union of the Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/sicilia-centrodestra-si-compatta-attorno-candidatura-1436499.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/politica/centrodestra-unito-sicilia-c-libera-musumeci-1436561.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corriere.it/politica/17_settembre_02/sicilia-berlusconi-scendo-campo-io-ok-ticket-musumeci-armao-45a10d06-8fe2-11e7-90ab-5e72a21f32c7.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://palermo.repubblica.it/politica/2017/09/02/news/regionali_berlusconi_in_campo_per_la_sicilia_modlelo_da_esportare_alle_politiche_-174455918&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Socialist Workers' Federation''' ({{lang-fr|Fédération Socialiste Ouvrière}}, {{lang-lad|Federacion}}, {{lang-tr|Selanik Sosyalist İşçi Federasyonu}}), was a socialist organisation in the [[Salonica Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (present-day [[Thessaloniki]]), led by [[Avraam Benaroya]]. It was an attempt at union of different nationalities' workers in [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]] within a single labor movement.

==The Federation in the Ottoman Empire==
[[File:Benaroya1914.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Avraam Benaroya]]]]
[[File:Workers March in Salonica 1908 - 1909.jpg|thumb|Jewish workers march, 1908 - 1909]]

Idealistic and pragmatist at the same time, [[Avraam Benaroya]], a [[Jew]] from [[Bulgaria]], played a leading role in the creation of the mainly Jewish ''Fédération Socialiste Ouvrière'' in Thessaloniki, in May–June 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Nar, Alberto: [http://www.intjewishlawyers.org/docenter/viewDocument.asp?id=9266 "The Jew of Thessaloniki March through Time"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627075049/http://www.intjewishlawyers.org/docenter/viewDocument.asp?id=9266 |date=2006-06-27 }}, in ''Justice. The International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists'', special issue: ''Remember Salonika'' (Spring 1999). ISSN 0793-176X. pp. 9-13.&lt;/ref&gt; His main associates were militant [[Sephardic Jews]], Alberto Arditti, David Recanati and Joseph Hazan, as well Bulgarians like Angel Tomov and [[Dimitar Vlahov]].

The organization took this name because, built on the federative model of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]], it was conceived as a federation of separate sections, each representing the four main ethnic groups of the city: [[Jew]]s, [[Bulgarians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]]. It initially published its literature in the languages of these four groups (i.e. Ladino, [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], respectively) but in practice the two latter sections were under-represented if not nonexistent. The publication's title was ''Journal del Labourador'' (Ladino) - ''Amele Gazetesi'' (Ottoman Turkish).

The democratic ''Fédération'' soon became, under Benaroya's leadership, the strongest [[Socialism|socialist party]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]], while the "[[Ottoman Socialist Party]]" was essentially an intellectual club, and the other socialist parties were at the same time national parties, like the [[Istanbul]] Greek Socialist Center, the [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]] or the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]].&lt;ref name="hur"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taraf.com.tr/makale/601.htm|title=Cumhuriyet’in Amele Evlatları!|last=Hür|first=Ayşe|date=April 24, 2008|publisher=[[Taraf]]|language=Turkish|accessdate=2009-11-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521160213/http://www.taraf.com.tr/makale/601.htm|archivedate=May 21, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It created combative trade unions, attracted important intellectuals and gained a solid base of support among Macedonian workers. By 1910, the ''Fédération'' comprised fourteen syndicates, and in 1912 it mobilized about 12,000 workers in various demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quataert|first=Donald|title=The Industrial working class of Salonica, 1850-1912 (in Jews, Turks, Ottomans: a shared history, fifteenth through the twentieth century)|editor=Levy, Avigdor|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2002|pages=395|isbn=978-0-8156-2941-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3lRkp8Oes18C&amp;pg=PA210|accessdate=2009-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1910 to 1911 Benaroya edited its influential newspaper, the ''[[Solidaridad Ovradera]]'', printed in Ladino. ''Fédération'' cultivated strong links with the [[Second International]] and had its own representative, Saul Nahum, in the [[International Socialist Bureau]].

Unlike other parties which were organised on ethnic lines, as a cross-community group the ''Fédération'' was tolerated by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities. A prominent Bulgarian member, [[Dimitar Vlahov]], was a socialist MP in the [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|new Ottoman parliament]], which was dominated by the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP) party until 1912. Indeed, its leaders initially supported the [[Young Turks]], and Benaroya participated in the "Action Army" march on [[Istanbul]] to help put down the [[Countercoup (1909)|Countercoup of 1909]]. Alarmed by the growing power of socialist groups, the CUP subsequently launched a crackdown, during which Benaroya was jailed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Mazower]], ''Salonica city of ghosts'', Vintage Books, New York, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-375-41298-1}} pp. 288f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their reference book over the Balkan Jews, [[Esther Benbassa]] and Aron Rodrigues show that the internationalist socialists of the ''Fédération'' defended the Ladino language against the [[Zionism|Zionists]], favouring [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and the ''[[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]'', who favoured French, thus remaining in some way close to the traditional Jewish world, they represented a form of westernization without assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-fr|''Les AA (''auteurs'') montrent comment en défendant la langue judéo-espagnole (contre les sionistes partisans de hébreu ou les francophones de l'Alliance) les socialistes internationalistes de la Fédération restaient en dernière analyse assez proches du monde juif traditionnel: ils représentaient une forme d'occidentalisation qui impliquait pas l'assimilation''|italic=unset}}, Löwy Michael, ''[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/assr_0335-5985_1994_num_86_1_1443_t1_0265_0000_4 Benbassa (Esther) Rodrigue (Aron) Juifs des Balkans.

[[File:Socialist Workers' Federation doc 1915.jpg|thumb|Socialist Workers' Federation (Φεντερασιόν in Greek). The official application with which the party is asking for recognition of the socialist youth in 1915.]]

In the aftermath of the incorporation of Thessaloniki into the Greek state during the [[Balkan Wars]], Benaroya resisted the attempts to impose ethnic divisions in the city. Opposed to the [[First World War]], Benaroya and another Jewish socialist were exiled for two and a half years at the island of [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]]. In contrast to most of the prominent socialists in the pre-1913 Greece who followed [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], Benaroya and the ''Fédération'', adhering to its internationalist ideals, mobilized for [[Neutral country|neutrality]]. As this happened to the same policy as pursued by King [[Constantine I of Greece]] and his militaristic entourage (see [[National Schism]]), this led to the loss of support for ''Fédération'' in [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]. After the departure of its Slavic element, the ''Fédération'' was numerically dominated by Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Benbassa, Esther: "Le sionisme dans l'Empire ottoman à l'aube du XXe siècle", in: XXe Siècle., n°24, oct. 1989, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1915 onwards the ''Fédération'' was buoyed by the popular reaction to the war. Both [[Monarchy|monarchist]] and Venizelist policy actually assisted the emancipation and the radicalization of the left, and Benaroya, keeping equal distance from both established political groups, was quick to turn the situation to advantage. In the [[Greek legislative election, May 1915|May 1915 general elections]] the ''Fédération'' sent two deputies representing Thessaloniki to the Greek Parliament, while it lost by only a few votes for a third seat. It already had strong links with internationalist groups and organizations all over Greece and abroad; from them the [[Communist Party of Greece|Socialist Workers' Party]] was to spring up in due time.&lt;ref&gt;Benbassa, Esther, and Rodrigue, Aaron: ''Historia de los judíos sefardíes. De Toledo a Salónica''. Abada, Madrid, 2004 {{ISBN|84-96258-31-9}}, pp. 308-310.&lt;/ref&gt; However, another socialist faction, headed by the future Prime Minister [[Alexandros Papanastasiou]], who sided with Venizelos in foreign affairs, also had deputies elected in the same election.

Papanastasiou and other reform-minded socialists strongly supported Venizelos' liberal brand of nationalism. Benaroya and the ''Fédération'', on the other hand, were influenced by [[Austromarxism|Austromarxists]] such as [[Victor Adler]], [[Otto Bauer]] and [[Karl Renner]], who, sensitive to matters national, searched ways to utilize socialism as a cohesive force for the decrepit [[Habsburg Monarchy]]; they elaborated the [[National personal autonomy|principle of personal autonomy]], according to which national consciousness should be depoliticized and become a personal matter. Modern states should be based on free association and allow self-definition and self-organization of ethnicities in cultural affairs, while a mixed parliament, proportionally representing all nations of the realm, should decide on economic and political questions. The ''Fédération'' traced the origins of its federative position in Balkan authors of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] like [[Rigas Velestinlis-Fereos|Rigas Velestinlis]], and stressed that the forthcoming peace should exclude any change of borders or transfer of populations. The [[SEKE|Socialist Labour Party of Greece]] (later renamed as Communist Party of Greece, KKE), created by Benaroya's initiative near the end of the [[First World War]], followed closely the ''Fédération'''s theses on national [[self-determination]], and wanted to transform the Greek state into a federation of [[Autonomous region|autonomous provinces]] that would safeguard the rights of minorities and participate in a federative Republic of the Balkan peoples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4327">'''Status Quo State''' is a term from [[Power Transition Theory]] within the wider field of [[International Relations]]. It is used to describe states, that unlike [[Revisionist State]]s see the international system of states, international law and often even free market economics as integral aspects of the international spectrum that should be upheld. 

Written on [https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=tbgYDAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=The+Origins+of+Revisionist+and+Status-Quo+States+By+J.+Davidson&amp;ots=2Mv5V4SA_I&amp;sig=DJkWBQqlx5iD-sVrFkTC0wFSWEU&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Origins%20of%20Revisionist%20and%20Sta The Origins of Revisionist and Status-Quo States by J. Davidson], status-quo state seekers strive to preserve things as they are. Whereas revisionists seek to change the way things are in international politics. When scholars categorize states as revisionist or status-quo seeking they are able to explain important outcomes in international politics, such as war and peace.  

Generally, there is a direct correlation between a state's hegemony, both political and economic and its standing as either a Status Quo State or a Revisionist State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/intlrel/pols315/Text/Theory/PowerTransitionTheory.htm Power Transition Theory, summary. Richard W. Chadwick&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Powerful and influential nations in International Relations such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and other nations like [[Japan]] who have benefited from western liberalism, are likely to fall under the category of ''Status Quo States'', while [[North Korea]], [[Iran]] and other nations dissatisfied with their place on the international stage are often considered Revisionist States.

== Characteristic of Status-quo state ==
A system consisting mostly of status-quo states need not devolve into war. Moreover, if status-quo states recognize each other as such and are not threatened by each other, they should be confronted with fewer cooperation-inhibiting problems (e.g., [[Relative gain (international relations)|relative gains]] concerns) than they would if they feared others’ intentions. 

The author mentions that according to the neoclassical realist framework, it points toward “new facts,” where they explain that periods of “concert” can occur when all or most states are committed to preserving the status quo. The author also explains this with the example of [https://www.britannica.com/event/Concert-of-Europe the Concert of Europe (1815-54)] where states were able to hold those norms and follow those rules because they were status-quo seekers and understood that their neighbors were also committed to the status quo.

Revisionist and status-quo states have been the core of the history of international relations. As the history of [[great power]] war and peace may be seen as a series of clashes between revisionists and status-quo seekers. Moreover, Status-quo states may ally with the most powerful state in the system if it is also a status-quo state, because they should not fear such a state and because they prefer to have defensive coalitions that are too large rather than too small.

[[File:Tony Blair.jpg|thumb|350px|Some people appointed to positions of power by Tony Blair were called "Tony's Cronies"]]
"'''Tony's Cronies'''" is a term in British politics and media given to people who were viewed as being given positions of power because of their personal friendships with [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]], during his [[Premiership of Tony Blair|premiership]] between 1997 and 2007.&lt;ref name=eco&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/230423 |title=The new establishment: Tony’s cronies? |work=The Economist |date=1999-08-05 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included those granted life peerages and public positions based on their friendship with Blair rather than their individual merits.&lt;ref name=ncc /&gt; The phrase was created by the [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative Party]] after the [[1997 United Kingdom general election]] and was continually used in the media throughout Blair's premiership.

== History ==
The term originated after the 1997 United Kingdom general election when the Conservative Party referred to people awarded positions of power by Tony Blair as "Tony's Cronies", as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had won the election.&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;  These people were compared to medieval courtiers, viewed to have been appointed to positions of power because of their historical personal background with Blair.  [[Lord Irvine]], appointed [[Lord Chancellor]], was Blair's first boss; whilst [[Anji Hunter]], who had been at school with Blair, was made Blair's office manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jan/05/uk.politicalnews1 |title=Tony's cronies: the inner circle of power |work=The Guardian |date=1999-01-05 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood friend and former flatmate, [[Charlie Falconer]], was appointed as a peer, sat on 14 [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] sub-committees and later joined the Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2984844.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Lordly heights for Blair's friend |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-06-12 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== House of Lords ===

During his first term of office, Blair created 203 [[life peers]], whom the Conservatives referred to as "Tony's Cronies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones |first=George |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1351595/Life-in-the-Lords-is-too-tough-says-Labour-peer.html |title=Life in the Lords is too tough says Labour peer |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2000-08-05 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[William Hague]], the [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] and the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], referred in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to the [[House of Lords Act 1999|House of Lords Bill]], as replacing the [[House of Lords]] with a "house of cronies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo981124/debtext/81124-05.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 24 Nov 1998 (pt 5) |work=Hansard |date=1998-11-24 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the bill was passed, it removed the rights of [[hereditary peers]] to sit in the House of Lords; they were replaced by life peers and the House of Lords was called "a chamber of Tony's Cronies", as a large number of life peers had been appointed by Blair to replace the hereditary peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Colin |last=Brown |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/parliament-house-of-lords--rearguard-action-against-chamber-of-tonys-cronies-1125057.html |title=Rearguard action against chamber of "Tony's cronies" |work=The Independent |date=1999-11-11 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while the bill was going through the Parliamentary stages, the Conservative hereditary peers voted through an amendment that an independent body, which became known as the [[House of Lords Appointments Commission]], would be created to check all further nominations to the House of Lords. This was intended to prevent the Prime Minister from being able to create new life peers at will or on personal grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=White |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jun/23/lordreform.constitution |title=Peers toughen body to stop 'Tony's cronies' safeguard |work=The Guardian |date= 2001-03-21|accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also made the provision for "[[people's peers]]" to be created, independent of political influence, which was viewed in the media as a way to balance against "Tony's Cronies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/People's+peers+to+combat+Tony's+cronies.-a060487421 |title=People's peers to combat Tony's cronies. |publisher=Coventry Evening Telegraph (archived at The Free Library) |date=1999-01-20 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the House of Lords Act removing a large number of Conservative Peers, the Conservatives still held a majority in that body, leading Blair to appoint additional peers; in 2004 alone he made 23 new appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Patrick |last=Wintour |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/may/01/uk.lords |title=Blair appointees on mission impossible to stop defeats |work=The Guardian |date=2004-05-01 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came after Conservative peers sometimes voted with [[crossbenchers]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] peers against Labour's proposed legislation. It was also due to poor attendance from the Labour Party's [[working peers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brogan |first=Benedict |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1460743/Tonys-cronies-pack-into-Lords.html |title=Tony's cronies pack into Lords |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2004-05-01 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Blair appointed 16 new life peers to the House of Lords, giving Labour their first ever majority in the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tonys-cronies-to-give-labour-lords-majority-7169941.html |title=Tony's cronies to give Labour Lords majority |work=London Evening Standard |date=2005-04-29 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regular appointments of new peers on apparent favouritism was criticized by the [[Scottish National Party]]'s [[chief whip]], [[Pete Wishart]], as a "typical Establishment fix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/tony-s-cronies-parachuted-in-as-new-labour-lords-1-529284 |title=Tony's cronies parachuted in as new Labour Lords |work=The Scotsman |date=2004-05-01 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other positions ===

The accusations of [[cronyism]] also extended to a number of public appointments Blair made. In 2001, the public administration [[select committee]] held an inquiry into the claims that the government rewarded "Tony's Cronies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brogan |first=Benedict |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1362232/MPs-investigate-Tonys-cronies.html |title=MPs investigate 'Tony's cronies' |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2001-11-13 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, there were also accusations of cronyism from the Conservatives and the [[Mayor of London]], [[Ken Livingstone]], when Labour gave [[Lord Hollick]], a friend of Blair, the chairmanship of the [[South Bank Arts Complex]] as a personal gift. Labour rejected this claim, saying that the appointment was not covered by the public appointments guidelines.&lt;ref name=ncc&gt;{{cite news|last=Reynolds |first=Nigel |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1385296/New-crony-claims-rejected-by-Labour.html |title=New crony claims rejected by Labour |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2002-02-19 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusation of "Tony's Cronies" also extended to the [[European Union]] when Blair appointed [[Peter Mandelson]] as the UK's [[European Commissioner|European Union Commissioner]]. This move was criticised by members of the Labour party, with Labour [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]], [[Ian Davidson (British politician)|Ian Davidson]], saying that it was "... seen as arrogance by [[New Labour]], bringing in a crony of the Prime Minister who is deeply unpopular in the Labour Party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/He's+not+crony+Blair%3A+Old+pals'+act%3B+Mandy+defends+his+new+Euro+job.-a0119725938 |title=He's not crony Blair: Old pals' act; Mandy defends his new Euro job. |location=Glasgow |publisher=Sunday Mail (The Free Library) |date=2004-07-24 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raising the spectre of "Tony's Cronies" became a standard method of attacking Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3055153.stm |title='Cronies' charges prompt veto demand |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-07-10 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be seen in the [[Cash for Honours]] scandal, when honours were believed to have been awarded to people in exchange for donations to the Labour Party.&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-351371/Tonys-cronies-peerages-sale.html |title=Tony's cronies and peerages up for sale |work=Daily Mail |date=2005-06-07 |accessdate=2013-05-03 |first=Stephen |last=Glover}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later discovered that Blair had given an honour to two-thirds of people who had donated over £50,000 to the Labour Party; donors who had given over £1,000,000 were either awarded with a life peerage or a knighthood.&lt;ref name=mail /&gt;

In 2007, Blair resigned and [[Gordon Brown]] took over the position of Prime Minister. Brown started to remove most of those who were seen as "Tony's Cronies" from the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], ending accusations of [[cronyism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-464812/Sweeping-Tonys-cronies.html |title=Sweeping out Tony's cronies |work=Daily Mail |date=2007-06-28 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were reports of Labour MPs trying to gain favour with Brown after he appointed his former press secretary, [[Ian Austin (politician)|Ian Austin]], as his [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]].&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web|first=Mary Ann |last=Sieghart |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article2612656.ece |title=Exit Tony’s cronies, but enter the Brown-nosers |work=The Times |date=2007-02-02 |accessdate=2013-05-03}} {{Subscription required|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
After Blair left office, people whom he had appointed to positions of power were still referred to as "Tony's Cronies" in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Geoffrey Levy |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2002302/How-onetime-Labour-bigwigs-raking-private-sector.html |title=How onetime Labour bigwigs are raking it in the private sector |work=Daily Mail |date=2011-06-10 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who had been given positions by Brown after he had become Prime Minister were referred to as "Brown-nosers".&lt;ref name=times /&gt; In 2010, when the Conservatives formed a new government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], the new Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] faced similar accusations to Blair when he was perceived as rewarding with life peerages those who had assisted him. These people were referred to as "Dave's Faves", an intended allusion to "Tony's Cronies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grice |first=Andrew |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tonys-cronies-to-daves-faves-cameron-repays-some-old-debts-2137104.html |title=Tony's cronies to Dave's faves: Cameron repays some old debts |work=The Independent |date=2010-11-18 |accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11597">[[Image:JO199411392.png|thumb|The Law as published in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]'']]

The '''Toubon Law''' (full name: ''law 94-665 of 4 August 1994 relating to usage of the [[French language]]'') is a law of the French government mandating the use of the [[French language]] in official government publications, in all advertisements, in all workplaces, in commercial contracts, in some other commercial communication contexts, in all government-financed schools, and some other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;See the text of the Toubon Law in English at [http://www.dglf.culture.gouv.fr/droit/loi-gb.htm La Délégation Générale à la Langue Française].&lt;/ref&gt;

The law does not concern private, non-commercial communications, such as non-commercial web publications by private bodies. It does not concern books, films, public speeches, and other forms of communications not constituting [[Commerce|commercial activity]]. However, the law mandates the use of the French language in all broadcast audiovisual programs, with exceptions for musical works and "original version" films.&lt;ref name="OpenSociety"&gt;See [http://www.eumap.org/topics/media/television_europe/national/france/media_fra1.pdf Television Regulation in France] a 2005 report sponsored by the [[Open Society Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast musical works are subject to [[Quota share|quota]] rules under a related law whereby a minimum percentage of the songs on radio and television must be in the French language.&lt;ref name=OpenSociety /&gt; 

The law takes its common name from [[Jacques Toubon]], who was [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] when it was passed, and who proposed the law to the [[National Assembly of France]]. A nickname is ''Loi Allgood'' &amp;ndash; "Allgood" is a [[morpheme]]-for-morpheme translation of "Toubon" into [[English language|English]] ("All Good" being a translation of "Tout bon") &amp;ndash; as the law can largely be considered to have been enacted in reaction to the increasing usage of English in advertisements and other areas in France. As the law sought to strengthen French as the dominant language within the countries and her territories, the law also ‘came under considerable attack from the European Commission which regarded its provisions as particularly offensive to the concept of free competition across national borders.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44961967|title=Identity, insecurity and image : France and language|last=E.|first=Ager, D.|date=1999|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=|isbn=1853594431|location=Clevedon, England|pages=44|oclc=44961967}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Provisions of the law==
One broad provision of the law applying to workplaces is that "any document that contains obligations for the employee or provisions whose knowledge is necessary for the performance of one's work must be written in French." Among other things, this means that computer software developed outside France must have its user interface and instruction manuals translated into French to be legally used by companies in France. The law includes an exception that "these provisions do not apply to documents coming from abroad", but this exception has been interpreted narrowly by the appellate courts. For example, in 2006 a French subsidiary of a US company was given a hefty [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] for delivering certain highly technical documents and software interfaces to its employees in the English language only, and this was upheld by the appellate court.&lt;ref name="GEMedicalSystemsCase"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abanet.org/labor/newsletter/intl/2006/Apr/france3.html |title=American Bar Association Report on GE Medical Systems case: French court fines US company for not using French language in France|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806073213/http://www.abanet.org/labor/newsletter/intl/2006/Apr/france3.html|archivedate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?oldAction=rechJuriJudi&amp;idTexte=JURITEXT000006948282 Ruling] from the Versailles Court of Appeal, 2 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Another broad provision of the law is that it makes it mandatory for commercial advertisements and public announcements to be given in French. This does not rule out advertisements made in a foreign language: it is sufficient to provide a translation in a footnote. This was justified as a measure for the protection of the consumer. Additionally, product packaging must be in French, though, again, translation in multiple languages can be provided.

A similar restriction—though implemented by [[primary legislation]] regulations and not as application of the Loi Toubon—applies to product labeling: product labels should be intelligible and in French, though additional languages may be present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069565&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006292770 Code de la consommation R112-8]&lt;/ref&gt; Some linguistic restrictions on product labeling were found to be incompatible with [[Law of the European Union|European law]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61998J0366:EN:NOT Ruling C-366-98 of 12 September 2000], [[Court of Justice of the European Communities]]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the directives concerning the freedom of movement of goods within the [[European Union]]. The French government then issued interpretation notes and amended regulations in order to comply.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Frangi, ''[http://www.cairn.info/revue-internationale-de-droit-economique-2003-1-page-135.htm Le consommateur français entre loi Toubon et droit communautaire]'', Revue internationale de droit économique, De Boeck Université, t. XVII, 1 2003/1, pp. 135-144, {{ISBN|2-8041-4232-9}}, {{DOI|10.3917/ride.171.0135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another provision, the law specifies obligations for public [[Legal personality#Juridicial persons|legal persons]] (government administrations, et al.), mandating the use of French in publications, or at least in summaries of publications. In France, it is a constitutional requirement that the public should be informed of the action of the government. Since the official language of France is French, it follows that the French public should be able to get official information in French.

Under the Toubon law, schools that do not use French as the medium of instruction are ineligible for government funding. This excludes the [[Breton language]] schools of [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Breton language]] for a summary of the Toubon Law's impact on the Breton language.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?oldAction=rechJuriAdmin&amp;idTexte=CETATEXT000008131414 Ruling 238653 of 29 November 2002] from the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]]: 50/50 French/Breton education cannot be publicly funded.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other restrictions concern the use of French in [[academic conference]]s. These are largely ignored by many public institutions, especially in the "hard" scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senat.fr/questions/base/1990/qSEQ901012253.html Question] from senator Danielle Bidard-Reydet and answer by the Minister of Research [[Hubert Curien]], 1991: the conclusion of a commission of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] is that enforcing the use of French in scientific conferences, through the use of simultaneous translations, would be not only costly but useless, and would damage the reputation of France among the international scientific community. The Ministry thus does not envision coercive measures, which would have the result of reducing the number of internal scientific conferences in France. Thus, the use of simultaneous translation is ''recommended'' (not impose).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/dglf/rapport/2008/Rapport_Parlement08.pdf 2008 Report from the General delegation to French language] to [[Parliament of France|Parliament]], pp. 33-39. The [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|National Centre for Scientific Research]] indicates that strict observance of the law would pose considerable problems. Page 39: 78% of research laboratories have organized or co-organized seminars, in France during the 2006-2007 school year. Out of that number, 62% organized sittings that took place essentially in a foreign language: 47% in humanities and social sciences, 71% in exact sciences. The operators indicated that sometimes sittings took place in a foreign language even though all participants were francophone. This situation took place within 35% of relevant laboratories (thus 16% of all laboratories), in approximately the same proportion in exact sciences and humanities and social sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; The original restrictions on colloquia also applied to private bodies, but that was found unconstitutional prior to enactment,&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], [http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/1994/94-345-dc/decision-n-94-345-dc-du-29-juillet-1994.10568.html 94-345 DC]&lt;/ref&gt; on grounds that they violated [[freedom of speech]], and the final form of the law was modified accordingly.

===Enforcement against French subsidiaries of US-based organizations===

In the mid-1990s, soon after the Toubon Law came into force, two French lobbying groups—the ''Association pour la Défense de la Langue Française'' and the ''L'Avenir de la Langue Française''—filed a complaint against [[Georgia Tech Lorraine]], the [[Metz]] campus of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. At the time of the complaint, all classes at this Lorraine school were conducted in English, and all course descriptions on its French Internet web site were in English only. The complaint invoked the Toubon Law to demand that the school's web site must be in French because the web site was effectively a commercial [[advertisement]] for the school's courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bruno|last=Giussani|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/cyber/euro/1231euro.html|title=Georgia Tech Is Sued For Non-French Web Site|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1996-12-31|accessdate=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the case was dismissed by the court on a minor legal technicality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/cyberia-l/msg01052.html|title=Victory in France|publisher=[[Findlaw]]|date=1997-06-09|accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lobbying groups chose to drop the matter, the school was moved to offer its French website in the French language in addition to English, although classes continued to be in English only.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.georgiatech-metz.fr/ Georgia Tech Lorraine website today].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the French subsidiary of the US company [[General Electric|General Electric Medical Systems]] was fined €500,000 plus an ongoing fine of €20,000 per day for not complying with the Toubon law.&lt;ref name="GEMedicalSystemsCase" /&gt;

'''Vermont Energy Investment Corporation''' or '''VEIC''' is a [[non-profit]] [[organization]] in  [[Chittenden County, Vermont]] that seeks to reduce the economic and environmental costs of [[energy]] consumption through [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[renewable energy]] adoption.  Since its founding in 1986, the organization has been involved in designing energy efficiency and renewable energy programs in [[North America]] and worldwide.

VEIC also operates three large-scale energy efficiency programs in the United States, including [[Efficiency Vermont]], the nation’s first statewide energy efficiency [[utility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vermont Legislature Resolution|url=http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2012/Acts/ActR490.pdf|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
VEIC was founded in 1986 by Beth Sachs and Blair Hamilton with a goal to reduce energy costs for consumers by promoting energy efficiency and encouraging the conservation of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vermont Legislature Resolution|url=http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2012/Acts/ActR490.pdf|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they focused their early efforts on helping reduce the burden of energy costs for low income consumers. By 1997, VEIC had implemented energy efficiency measures in nearly 100 low-income multifamily buildings throughout the state of Vermont; it also led a successful effort to establish an ordinance requiring landlords in the city of Burlington to meet a minimum efficiency standard before their buildings could be sold to new owners. Through a partnership with the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, VEIC also helped to establish financing programs and a home energy rating system to help low-income and first-time homebuyers avoid being burdened with high energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change Solutions – Vermont Trims Energy Bills for Low-Income Families|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/40000PQ2.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1995%20Thru%201999&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;UseQField=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C95THRU99%5CTXT%5C00000013%5C40000PQ2.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p%7Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1|publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, VEIC won a competitive contract to operate Efficiency Vermont, the first statewide energy efficiency utility in the nation. Efficiency Vermont has been credited as an effective program:
* By the end of 2005, annual energy usage in Vermont had been reduced by 98,000 megawatt-hours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kardashian|first=Kirk|title=Energy Stars|url=http://www.7dvt.com/2008energy-stars|newspaper=Seven Days|date=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2007 Vermont became the first state in the nation to turn electrical load growth negative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnstone|first=Scott|title=Energy Efficiency as a Resource: Moving from Inclusion to Front of the Line|url=http://aceee.org/files/pdf/conferences/eer/2011/ML_Johnstone.pdf|publisher=American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Between 2009-2011, estimated energy savings produced by Efficiency Vermont were 304,000 megawatt-hours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficiency Vermont 2011 Annual Savings Claim|url=http://efficiencyvermont.com/docs/about_efficiency_vermont/annual_reports/2011_Savings_Claim_Summary_EfficiencyVermont.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, efficiency accounted for a 1.91 percent reduction in Vermont’s electricity supply requirements and 790,000 tons of avoided CO2 emissions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficiency Vermont 2011 Annual Savings Claim|url=http://efficiencyvermont.com/docs/about_efficiency_vermont/annual_reports/2011_Savings_Claim_Summary_EfficiencyVermont.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, VEIC established a 20-year goal to offset twice the amount of greenhouse gas emissions projected to be emitted in Vermont in the year 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vermont Legislature Resolution|url=http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2012/Acts/ActR490.pdf|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of 2010-2011, VEIC won competitive contracts to start up and begin operation of additional large-scale energy efficiency programs based in Ohio and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=D’Ambrosio|first=Dan|title=Efficiency Vermont serves as a model of energy savings|url=http://www.vermontfuel.com/VFDA_News_files/Efficiency%20Vermont%20Expands.pdf|newspaper=Burlington Free Press|date=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiency Smart, based in Columbus, Ohio, is a program of energy efficiency services offered to a network of public power companies that are members of American Municipal Power, Incorporated (AMP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficiency Smart: About US|url=http://efficiencysmart.org/About_Us.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; VEIC operates Efficiency Smart under contract to AMP and has designed the program to save 70,000 megawatt-hours of electricity over the course of its first three years in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Efficiency Company to Help Utilities in 6 States|url=http://www.vpr.net/news_detail/88280/efficiency-company-to-help-utilities-in-6-states/|newspaper=Vermont Public Radio|date=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The District of Columbia Sustainable Energy Utility (DC SEU) is operated under contract to the District Department of the Environment in Washington, D.C. The DC SEU contract is held by the Sustainable Energy Partnership, with VEIC serving as the partnership lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=District of Columbia Sustainable Energy Utility: About US|url=http://dcseu.com/DCSEU_about_us.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, VEIC, The Clark Group, and Vermont Law School were awarded a $34 million blanket purchase agreement to help the Environmental Protection Agency improve energy efficiency for commercial, institutional, and industrial customers throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sands|first=Laura|title=Clark Group Press Release on EPA Contract|url=http://clarkgroupllc.com/news/Clark_Group_National_Press_Release.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 2012 U.S. Senate forum on jobs, Scott Johnstone, the Executive Director of VEIC, reported that the organization continues to grow, despite the economic recession that began in 2008. According to his statement, from 2005-2012 VEIC increased its number of employees by 130%, and its revenues grew by 286%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Senate: Steering Committee Meeting on Jobs|url=http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/photos/gallery/?id=5d38e903-e433-414e-9ad9-ca03bcab2753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VEIC is also an active resource on transportation efficiency. It is facilitating the state of Vermont’s participation in the Rocky Mountain Institute’s “Project Get Ready” program, which is working to prepare for the electrification of the transportation system. It is also conducting research on least-cost transportation strategies, and best practices for applying energy efficiency principles to travel behavior and consumer purchase decisions in the transportation sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glitman|first=Karen|title=Creative Corner: A vision for Vermont's transportation future|url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20120419/BUSINESS08/120418024/Creative-Corner-vision-Vermont-s-transportation-future?odyssey=mod%7Cnewswell%7Ctext%7CFRONTPAGE%7Cs&amp;gcheck=1&amp;nclick_check=1|newspaper=Burlington Free Press|date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
