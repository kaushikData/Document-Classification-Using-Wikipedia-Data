==Rules==
The players include a thrower and many [[catcher]]s. The thrower will decide if points will be awarded if the ball is caught directly ('alive'), if the ball must be picked up after it hits the ground ('dead'), or either. The thrower also has the responsibility to determine the number of [[Score (sport)|points]] that should be distributed. For example, a thrower calls out, "100, dead!" and throws the ball straight up in the air. All the catchers must wait until the ball touches the ground before they pick it up in order to receive the 100 points at stake. If a catcher's score goes over 500, that person will revert to 0 and will become the thrower, and the thrower will in turn become a catcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Acro dance''' is a style of [[dance]] that combines [[classical dance]] technique with precision [[acrobatic]] elements. It is defined by its athletic character, its unique [[choreography (dance)|choreography]], which seamlessly blends dance and acrobatics, and its use of acrobatics in a dance context.&lt;ref name=IndustryDef&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a popular dance style in amateur [[competitive dance]] as well as in professional dance theater and in [[contemporary circus]] productions such as those by [[Cirque du Soleil]]. This is in contrast to [[acrobatic gymnastics|acrobatic]], [[artistic gymnastics|artistic]] and [[rhythmic gymnastics]], which are sports that employ dance elements in a gymnastics context under the auspices of a governing gymnastics organization (such as [[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]]) and subject to a [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]]. Acro dance is known by various other names including ''acrobatic dance'' and ''gymnastic dance'', though it is most commonly referred to simply as ''acro'' by dancers and dance professionals.

Acro is an especially challenging [[List of dance style categories|dance style]] for dancers as it requires them to be trained in both dance and acrobatic skills. Acro dancers must be in excellent physical condition as well, because acro is a physically demanding activity.

==History==

[[File:La Sylphe02.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Vaudeville dancer [[La Sylphe]] (c. 1908)]]
Acrobatic dance emerged in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in the early 1900s, as one of the types of acts performed in [[vaudeville]]. Although individual dance and acrobatic acts had been performed in vaudeville for several decades prior to 1900, it was not until the early 1900s that it became popular to perform acts that combined dance and acrobatic movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dancepoise.com/information-about-acro-dance|title=Acro Dance - A Rhythmic Amalgamation of Acrobatics and Dance|work=DancePoise|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acrobatic dance did not suddenly appear in vaudeville; rather, it appeared gradually over time in a variety of forms, and consequently no individual performer has been cited as its originator. Sherman Coates (1872–1912),&lt;ref name="NYAge 1912 May 30" /&gt; who performed with the Watermelon Trust from 1900 to 1914, was recalled by fellow dancers as the first acrobatic dancer they had ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

	}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the earliest documented acrobatic dance performers was Tommy Woods, who became well known for his slow-motion acrobatic dance in ''[[Shuffle Along]]'', in which he would execute acrobatic movements precisely in time with the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

	}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, acrobat Lulu Coates formed the Crackerjacks, a popular vaudeville troupe that included acrobatic dance in their performance repertoire up until the group disbanded in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since the decline of the vaudeville era, acrobatic dance has undergone a multi-faceted evolution to arrive at its present-day form. The most significant aspect of this evolution is the integration of [[ballet technique]] as the foundation for dance movements, thus bringing into acro dance a precision of form and movement that was absent in vaudeville acrobatic dance. Also, vaudeville acrobatic dances were often little more than acrobatics set to music, whereas modern acro dance is fundamentally dance, with its acrobatic movements performed in a dance context.

==Characteristics==

A defining characteristic of acro is the smooth, graceful transitions between dance and acrobatic movements. Also, a dance must have a significant percentage of dance movement, with respect to its acrobatic content, in order for it to be categorized as acro. For example, a gymnastics [[floor (gymnastics)|floor exercise]] is not considered to be acro because it has little or no dance movement compared to its acrobatic content, and also because it lacks smooth transitions between dance and gymnastic movements.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Dance technique===

The dance movements in acro are founded in [[ballet]], [[jazz dance|jazz]], [[lyrical dance|lyrical]] and [[modern dance]] styles. Acro dance movements are not restricted to these dance styles, but the complete absence of these styles will typically cause a dance to be categorized as something other than acro (e.g., [[breakdance]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Acrobatic elements===

The acrobatic movements and acts of balance performed in an acro dance are referred to as ''tricks''. A variety of tricks are commonly performed in acro dance, varying widely in complexity and the skills required to perform them. Aside from the obvious requirement that dancers possess the requisite skills to perform tricks, the types of tricks that can be performed in an acro dance depends on the number of dancers.
'''Solo tricks''' can be performed by independent dancers in [[solo (dance)|solo]] or group dances. Examples of this are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Double tricks'''—also known as ''partnering tricks''—can only be performed by a pair of dancers. An example of this is the ''pitch tuck'', in which one dancer forms a "saddle" with his hands. The second dancer steps onto the saddle and then the first dancer thrusts the saddle upward. The second dancer, who is propelled upward with back rotation, lands on her feet after a complete revolution in the air. Acro partners will sometimes execute lifts and [[adagio (dance)|adagio]] in addition to single and double tricks.

'''Group tricks''' generally require three or more dancers. Examples of this are:

==Apparel==
===Footwear===
[[Image:AcroShoes.jpg|right|thumb|A pair of acro shoes.]]
[[Image:Foot Thong.jpg|right|thumb|A ''foot thong'', as viewed from the bottom.]]

Acro dances are typically performed on hard stages with widely varying surfaces. Such floors differ substantially from a [[gymnastics floor]], which is constructed by layering a standard surface over cushioning foam and spring floor. Whereas gymnasts perform [[barefoot]] and rely on the standard gymnastics floor for traction and cushioning, acro dancers seldom dance barefoot, instead depending on footwear such as acro shoes or foot thongs to provide the necessary traction and cushioning.

All of the most common types of acro footwear provide both traction and cushioning. In addition, acro performance surfaces are frequently rough, so acro footwear must protect the bottom of the foot from skin abrasion. [[Abrasion (medical)|Abrasion]] protection is particularly important on the ball of the foot, which is subjected to a great deal of [[friction]] during [[dance turn]]s and leaps. [[Traction (engineering)|Traction]] is essential to prevent lateral slipping that could result in dangerous falls to the hard floor. [[Cushioning]] serves to soften the impact when performing tricks such as tucks and layouts, in which a dancer's feet may strike the floor at high [[velocity]]. Cushioning is especially important when a [[Marley floor]] is unavailable, because uncovered performance surfaces have no cushioning whatsoever and thus may be extremely hard and unyielding.

====Acro shoes====

Acro dancers most often wear [[jazz dance shoe]]s, which are commonly referred to as ''acro shoes'' by acro dancers. Acro shoes are called ''jazz boots'', ''jazz ankle boots'', ''jazz booties'' and other names, by their various manufacturers. They are typically laceless, slip-on shoes, with tight-fitting leather uppers that are designed to prevent the dancer's feet from shifting inside the shoes. Because of their thin, pliable leather uppers and split soles, acro shoes have excellent flexibility, thus enabling dancers to attain both good dance form and acrobatic control. The sole is made of soft, composite rubber so as to provide both high traction and cushioning, and it provides excellent protection from skin abrasion as it covers the entire bottom of the foot.

====Foot thongs====

Less commonly, acro dancers may wear ''foot thongs'', which are variously called ''Dance Paws'' and ''FootUndeez'', depending on the manufacturer. Foot thongs—which are slip-on, partial foot covers that protect only the ball of the foot—are sometimes preferred over acro shoes for aesthetic reasons. In particular, flesh colored foot thongs endow the wearer with the appearance of having bare feet, while retaining some degree of the traction, cushioning, and abrasion protection provided by acro shoes.

===Clothing===
[[Image:AcroDanceHandstand.jpg|right|thumb|The skirt of this acro [[dance costumes|costume]] is short so it will not contact the headpiece when the dancer is inverted.]]
Acro dancers commonly wear flexible, form-fitting clothing for both [[safety]] and [[aesthetic]] reasons. Form-fitting clothing is preferred over loose clothing because the latter does not move [[synchronization|synchronously]] with the body and thus may interfere with a dancer's ability to maintain control. This is especially important when a dancer is performing tricks, as loss of control can lead to serious injury. Aside from the safety aspect, form-fitting clothing also helps to expose a dancer's body lines, which can add significantly to the visual impact of an acro dance performance.

Competitive acro dancers frequently wear [[dance costumes|costumes]] when performing at dance competitions. Acro costumes often have loose [[fabric]] pieces such as short [[skirts]], but the sizes and locations of these pieces are carefully calculated to ensure that they pose no safety risks. As an extra safety measure, skirts are sometimes pinned or stitched at the back below the waistline so that they will not hang at full length when the dancer is inverted, as in [[hand walking]]; this prevents the skirt—which might otherwise become entangled in the dancer's hair or costume [[headpiece]]—from contacting the dancer's head.

==Competitive acro==

Acro dance is not uniformly defined within the [[Competitive dance#Competitive Dance Industry|competitive dance industry]].&lt;ref name=IndustryDef /&gt; Some dance competition companies require an acro routine to have a minimum of four or five tricks with at most fifty percent acrobatic content. Other companies require an acro routine to have exactly, or more than, fifty percent acrobatic content. Also, at some competitions an acro dance may fit into an explicitly defined "acro dance" performance category, while at others it may fall into a similar category such as "acro/gym," or an alternative category such as "open." Because of these differences, it may be necessary to enter a specific acro routine into different performance categories at different competitions.

'''Ahmad Joudeh''' (born April 4, 1990 in [[Yarmouk Camp|Yarmouk]]) is a ballet dancer and a choreographer from [[Syria]]. He moved to the Netherlands with help of the [[Dutch National Ballet|Dutch National Ballet Company]]. He is currently internationally active as an artist.

== Early life ==
Born in 1990, Joudeh grew up in [[Yarmouk Camp|Yarmouk]], a Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus, His mother is Syrian, his father Palestinian. Although his father did not approve of his interest in dance, Joudeh persisted, studying dance in Damascus.

From 2007 Until 2016, he lived in Damascus, studying dance,  and teaching ballet to support himself, and to orphaned and disabled children free of charge. His mother still lives  in Syria. His father is  an asylum seeker center in Germany, where father and son recently reconciled after an estrangement of eleven years.

== Dance ==
In 2014 he was a contestant in the Arab version of ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]''. He made it to the semi-finals.   But because he was a Palestinian without national identity, he was told he could not win. Nevertheless, his appearances  brought him to the attention of Dutch filmmaker [[Roozbeh Kaboly]], who produced a documentary that aired on Dutch television.

Joudeh has also produced several short YouTube videos that depict him dancing in Syria.

== Dutch News Documentaries ==
In 2016 [[Roozbeh Kaboly]], from the Dutch news program [[Nieuwsuur]], made a 15-minute documentary about Ahmad called ''Dance or Die.''  It depicts him dancing in the ruins of the camp where he had grown up, visiting his  family's former home in Palmyra, which has been destroyed,  with his mother, and the ancient [[Roman Theatre at Palmyra|Roman theater of Palmyra]], where he dances. Joudeh also takes the filmmakers to his dance studio in Damascus, where some of his young students talk about their lives, and what dance means to them. The ancient Roman theater in Palmrya was subsequently destroyed by ISIS.

A second film about Joudeh, [[Dance for Peace]] , which includes his meeting  and reconciliation with his father at his refugee camp in Berlin, was recently broadcast on Dutch television on the [[Nieuwsuur]] program. It depicts his life once he has moved to the Netherlands and has begun dancing with the [[Dutch National Ballet|Dutch National Ballet Company]].

== Life in the Netherlands ==

After the documentaries aired, Joudeh received invitations to dance  from a number of countries, including the U.S, Switzerland and Belgium. He decided to go to the Netherlands at the invitation of [[Ted Brandsen,]] artistic director of the [[Dutch National Ballet|Dutch National Ballet Company]]. Brandsen also started a crowd funder titled [[Dance for Peace]] to support Joudeh.

'''Analogue terrestrial television in the United Kingdom''' was originally the method by which the significant majority of viewers in the UK, the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]] received television. [[Analog television|Analogue]] terrestrial television broadcasts have ceased everywhere in the UK with [[Northern Ireland]] being the last region to have ceased broadcasting analogue terrestrial television broadcasts. Northern Ireland switched off the last analogue television signals, making all of the United Kingdom only capable of receiving digital television, in the early hours of 24 October 2012. It has been completely replaced by [[digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom|digital terrestrial television]] and other non-terrestrial means as of the end of 2012.

==Channels available==

The following channels, all of which are [[free-to-air]], were available on a national basis and continue to be available via [[digital terrestrial television]]:

# [[BBC One]]
# [[BBC Two]]
# [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (made up of a number of regional franchises)
# [[Channel 4]] ([[S4C]] in Wales before analogue services closed there.)
# [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]

Prior to the cessation of analogue services, the first four services were available to 99% of households, with the more recent Channel 5 available to around 70%. There were additionally a number a smaller local channels available in particular areas, such as [[Channel M]], which was available in [[Manchester]] and [[Six TV]] available in Oxford, Southampton, Reading and Portsmouth.

ITV, BBC One and BBC Two carried regional programmes, such as the local news, and continue to do so digitally. The ITV Network is made up of a number of regional operators, though a series of consolidation has resulted in most owned by [[ITV plc]].

==Additional services==

All channels carried at least one [[teletext]] service. This included [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] for many programmes.

==Broadcasters==

The terrestrial analogue services themselves were in most cases unique when compared to most non-analogue broadcast services (such as those available via digital satellite), in that they are much older, contain a much more diverse range of programming, rather than centring on a specific genre (all five major stations carry news bulletins, for example) and all hold some form of [[Public broadcasting|public service]] requirement in terms of their output.

===BBC===

The [[BBC]] (British Broadcasting Corporation) began a regular television service, one of the first in the world, in 1936 as the BBC Television Service, funded to this day by a yearly mandatory [[Television licence|licence fee]]. Since 1964 the BBC have provided two analogue television services, [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]]. Both services carried a wide variety of content as well as [[regional variation]]s in programming and sometimes [[Continuity (broadcasting)|continuity]]. Latterly the BBC Two variations have been limited to England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. For many years, BBC One in Wales was effectively a separate service, [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]], though many programmes were common to both it and BBC One proper.

===ITV===
[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] (Independent Television) was established in 1954, providing the first commercial alternative to the BBC. Programmes would be funded through the 'selling' of air-time for the playing of [[advertising|advertisements]]; the broadcasters, the first of which began broadcasting in 1955, would be privately owned.

An [[Independent Television Authority]] (ITA), (superseded by the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA), [[Independent Television Commission]] (ITC) and latterly [[Ofcom]]) would choose the companies licensed to broadcast on a periodic basis. Each company would be (and nominally still is) afforded a 'franchise' to broadcast to a specific coverage area of the UK, with larger areas sometimes having two broadcasters 'time-sharing' a channel between weekdays and weekends. A separate nationwide 'breakfast' franchise also began in 1983.

Most viewers would only receive one service (unless they happened to receive signals from two transmitters in different areas). Each regional 'franchisee' would broadcast a combination of unique regional programmes and shared 'networked' content aired nationwide; the latter practice becoming ever more commonplace throughout the network's history. Originally each company would broadcast with their own, unique station name, such as "[[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]]" or "[[Associated-Rediffusion]]"; with separate continuity announcers and on-screen presentation. It was not until the late 1980s that popular use of the name "ITV" was used as a major on-screen brand, a practice which did not become universal in the ITV plc owned regions until the early 2000s.

ITV was established as a [[Public broadcasting|public service broadcaster]] with various requirements placed upon it affecting the nature of broadcast content, mandatory programming, daily limits on broadcast hours, strict controls on advertising practices and the process by which franchises were awarded.

Various relaxations on these requirements and restrictions were made throughout its history, with a substantial set of [[deregulation]] taking place upon the implementation of the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]]. Lifting of ownership restrictions resulting from this act and subsequent acts resulted in a single [[ITV plc]] owning and operating the majority of franchises by the early 2000s, with a common identity as '[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'. Three exceptions remain; [[STV Group (Scotland)|STV Group plc]], owns two franchises in Scotland broadcasting as [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] whilst [[UTV Media|UTV]] broadcasts to Northern Ireland under that name.

Other relaxations have substantially reduced the requirement for ITV to air particular types of programmes, though requirements such as local and national news provision remain.

The 1990 act formally introduced the legal title of 'Channel 3', though with limited exceptions this has never been used on-screen.

For many years, the ITA, IBA and the ITV companies campaigned for further frequencies on which to broadcast, though these goals were never wholly realised on analogue.

===Channel 4 and S4C===
After many decades of demand by the commercial broadcasters for a second commercial station or network of stations, [[Channel 4]] and [[S4C]] were launched in 1982. Channel 4 was originally run as a uniform national service, by the IBA through a subsidiary, the Channel Four Broadcasting Company. Channel 4 does not make the programmes it broadcasts; content is commissioned from independent, private production companies such as the ITV companies and companies not related to ITV who had previously little space to broadcast in the UK. Channel 4 was originally funded by allowing each local ITV franchisee to sell adverts during the station's airtime in their area in exchange for a guaranteed income to be paid to the IBA. The station was established with the intention to provide programmes for minority groups and cater for specialist interests and has a remit that details these obligations.

Since the abolition of the IBA, which took effect in 1993, Channel 4 has been run by the publicly owned, [[Channel Four Television Corporation]] and manages its own advertising.

'''S4C''' ({{lang-cy|Sianel Pedwar Cymru}}; ''Channel 4 Wales'') began broadcasts the day before Channel 4 after demands for a dedicated Welsh-language service for Wales. Previously ITV and the BBC were obliged to air Welsh language programmes, though these were often shown at off-peak times. S4C broadcast in place of Channel 4 which would never be available in Wales via analogue terrestrial; consequently some Channel 4 programmes were aired during off-peak times on S4C. Digital platforms in Wales provide both services; S4C's digital variant airing Welsh-language content only.

S4C is operated by the [[S4C Authority]], independent of the IBA and latterly Ofcom and is funded through advertising and direct government funding. The BBC also airs its Welsh language programmes on the service, funded by the licence fee. S4C ceased broadcasting on analogue at the end of March 2010, when the last analogue television transmissions in Wales ended.

===Channel 5===
A fifth service was licensed during the 1990s and began broadcasts in 1997, called Channel 5, it has since been re-branded as Five and later back to [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in August 2010.

The Channel 5 licence has one single licensee and provides a nationwide service. Compared to the other analogue broadcasters, it has relatively few public-service obligations, provision of news programming being one exception. Limited space within the analogue television bands meant Channel 5 had substantially reduced coverage compared to the other networks, at around 70% coverage.

===Restricted service licences===
{{Main article|Restricted Service Licence}}

In addition to the five national networks, a limited number of local stations were broadcast to various towns and cities under what was known as a [[Restricted Service Licence]]. These occupied channels unused by the other broadcasters that could be used without causing interference in other regions, and were frequently broadcast at a lower power than the major channels. Their output was mainly local, and each contract for an RSL lasted four years until 2004 when media regulator [[Ofcom]] stated that each licence will be renewed up until [[digital switchover]].

Television broadcasting began on an experimental basis by the [[BBC]] in London in 1936 on [[VHF]] [[Band I]]. Initially the service was operated using two competing systems:

The earliest television broadcasts used the 240-line Baird system and the [[405-line]] Marconi-EMI system on alternate weeks. However, the Baird system proved too cumbersome and by early 1937 had been dropped and the Marconi-EMI system became the standard. This system was later codified by the [[ITU]]'s CCIR (now [[ITU-R]]) on an international conference in [[Stockholm]] in 1961 as [[Broadcast television system#ITU identification scheme|System A]].

Different broadcast stations across the country were broadcast on different channels to avoid interference and allow for [[Regional variations (television)|regional variations]].

Broadcast was suspended during the Second World War but resumed in 1946. The BBC was joined on this system in 1955 with the launch of commercial television in the form of the regional [[ITV (TV network)|Independent Television]] (ITV) network, managed by the [[Independent Television Authority]] (ITA), which also saw the use of VHF [[Band III]].

This was the sole system in existence until the preparations for the introduction of 625-line transmission in 1964 and was put out of use at the start of 1985.

1964 saw the launch of a third television service, known as [[BBC Two|BBC2]], and with it the introduction of the 625 line service on [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] Bands [[Band IV|IV]] and [[Band V|V]]. Whilst the extra lines theoretically offered better resolution and picture clarity, the fledgling network of new transmitters required to provide the service offered far inferior coverage compared with the existing VHF services and was prone to increased interference often resulting in poor picture quality. Furthermore, few people had the new sets required to receive the new service or the different type of aerial required to pick up the UHF signal.

====Colour====

During the late 1950s, when the decision to introduce colour television was first seriously mooted, the then two main systems for consideration were the French [[SECAM]] and American [[NTSC]] systems, the latter generally considered superior and expected to be adopted. Throughout the 1960s a third competing system, [[PAL]], became available and was eventually adopted by [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|the GPO]] for use on the 625 line service, to be known as [[Broadcast television system#ITU identification scheme|System I]] or '''PAL-I'''.

Broadcast on this system officially commenced in 1967 with BBC2's (and the UK's) launch of colour television programming, though previous years had seen many unofficial colour test films outside of official broadcasting hours, including some which trialled NTSC and SECAM. BBC2 was joined in 1969 by [[BBC One|BBC1]] and the main [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchises (the rest following in stages into the 1970s). Both BBC1 and ITV continued to broadcast simultaneously on the VHF system A until 1985

====NICAM-728 Digital stereo====

Without affecting the definition of the "[[PAL]]-I" system, the UK also used a digital stereo companding system on analogue terrestrial television called NICAM. Standing for Near Instantaneous Companded Audio Multiplex and used for digital stereo TV broadcasts to the public, it used the [[NICAM]] digital audio system used since the early 1970s for transmitting the audio carrier signal of a broadcast between two or more regional broadcasters and sometimes to the transmitters, where it was converted back to an analogue FM audio carrier 6&amp;nbsp;MHz above the video carrier signal.

Reception of the NICAM signal provided the user had a VCR or a TV capable of decoding the NICAM signal, which was broadcast on a carrier 6.552&amp;nbsp;MHz above the video carrier, and thus just 0.552&amp;nbsp;MHz above the FM mono audio carrier. The first UK NICAM stereo broadcast was made in May 1986 on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], NICAM slowly being rolled out across the UK and across the broadcaster's programme schedules over the next 5 years, culminating in the official launch of NICAM on the BBC in 1991, ITV and Channel 4 having begun broadcasting NICAM in 1989 and 1990 respectively.

The service was sometimes referred to by its full, official, name, NICAM-728 – the 728 denoting the datarate of the digital stereo information – the datarate was 728kbit/s, non-[[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]].

====Channel allocations====

The 625 line system divided the spectrum into 44 channels, 21–34 and 39–68 (Bands IV and V). These channels were allocated, by the GPO, to the broadcasters to allow for four networks to operate with eventual maximum coverage and minimum cross-network interference. The two BBC channels and the ITV network were catered for, as well as space for a future fourth network, at the time expected to be a second network for the [[Independent Television Authority|ITA]]. The fourth network didn't come into being until the [[Broadcasting Act 1980]] created Channel 4 and S4C. This early provision meant that near complete coverage was afforded to both networks at launch, in 1982.

When [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] launched in 1997 it was allocated UHF channels which were in use by many domestic [[VCR]]s, requiring a massive equipment retuning exercise to be undertaken at the broadcaster's expense. Additionally, lack of compatibility with older antennas, plus existing use of the channels by stations in France, meant that Channel 5 never acquired the level of analogue coverage enjoyed by the other broadcasters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Digital switch-over==
{{further|Digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom}}
The government was committed to switching terrestrial television broadcasting to fully digital by 2012. The digital network features six multiplexes at each of the 80 main nodes, at other nodes there is only three multiplexes because fewer broadcasters were interested in the less densely populated regions. A company called [[Digital UK]] was set up to handle the change. The switch was on a region by region basis using the ITV regions as a basis. The schedule was announced by [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]], [[Tessa Jowell]] on 15 September 2005

Some concern had been raised that the London region would be switched shortly before the city hosts the [[2012 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]]. Jowell said "''I can assure you that I did not slog for two years to bring the games here just to see Londoners reduced to huddling round the wireless to find out who won the hundred metres, I am completely confident that our timetable is a sensible one which will ensure that digital services are delivered with no disruption to the viewing public during the Games themselves.''"

It was also announced that a support scheme would be put in place to ensure that no one is left behind in the switch. It provided help with equipment and installation and follow-up support for people aged 75 years and over and people with significant disabilities. The scheme was funded by the BBC through the licence fee.

The final region to switch off was [[Northern Ireland]], on 23 October 2012. To dedicate the permanent switching-off of analogue in Northern Ireland, and, by extension, the United Kingdom, [[BBC Northern Ireland]] and [[UTV Media|UTV]] together aired "The Magic Box", a programme dedicated to analogue TV: it became the last programme broadcast in analogue in the United Kingdom.

'''Anne Lloyd Vincent''', known professionally as '''Anne Lloyd''' (November 25, 1923 – August 27, 1999) was a clear-voiced and charismatic American singer best known for her children's records on the [[Golden Records]] label.

==Biography==

Born in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]], Anne Lloyd's family relocated to Great Cove during the Great Depression. She married her high school sweetheart, William Vincent, in 1943 and commenced her career singing with the [[Robert Shaw (conductor)]] Collegiate Chorale. She also was a featured singer with touring big bands, but as this end of the music business began to fade with the end of World War II, Lloyd sought other opportunities. In 1948 she became a staff singer with Arthur Shimkin's newly-established [[Golden Records]] label. Lloyd was one of the most prolific singers on the label and was often also featured as part of the [[The Sandpipers#Other Sandpipers|Sandpipers]], a [[Mitch Miller]]-led group that made many records for Golden. Although Lloyd continued to sing after she left Golden Records in the mid-1950s, she did not record after that and considered herself semi-retired. She died of cancer in 1999 in Great Neck, where she and her husband had settled in 1949 after he built a house for them there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/news/obituaries-former-singer-anne-lloyd-vincent-73-of-glen-cove-1.410564 Newsday]&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd also recorded for [[Bell Records]].

==Legacy==

Anne Lloyd made more than a hundred records for Golden, many of which appeared on its 6-inch subsidiary, Little Golden Records. These discs were an integral part of the life soundtrack of millions of American children during the Eisenhower era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/from-your-golden-childhood-the-best-of-little-golden-records-vol-1-mw0000823051 From Your Golden Childhood]&lt;/ref&gt; While many celebrity voices were featured on Golden Records,&lt;ref&gt;[http://versemusicgroup.com/tag/little-golden-records Little Golden Records]&lt;/ref&gt; several of the records made by Anne Lloyd may be considered among the most memorable.

==Overview==
Arabic cinema is dominated by [[Cinema of Egypt|Egyptian movies]]. Three quarters of all Arab movies are produced in Egypt.

There is increased interest in films originating in the Arab world. For example, films from [[Algeria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Morocco]], the [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Syria]] and [[Tunisia]] are making wider and more frequent rounds than ever before in local film festivals and repertoire theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2501/is_1-2_27/ai_n15694703|title=FindArticles.com {{!}} CBSi|website=findarticles.com|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
There are numerous film festivals that have historically been and are held in various parts of the Arab world to both honor and showcase films from the Arab regions, as well as international standouts.

Since 1976, [[Cairo]] has held the annual [[Cairo International Film Festival]], which has been accredited by the [[International Federation of Film Producers Associations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukhotmovies.com/film-festivals/cairo-film-festival/information.html Cairo Film Festival information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208183113/http://www.ukhotmovies.com/film-festivals/cairo-film-festival/information.html |date=2011-12-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also another festival held in [[Alexandria]]. Of the more than 4,000 short- and feature-length films made in Arabic-speaking countries since 1908, more than three-quarters were Egyptian.

In 1987, the inaugural Mogadishu Pan-African and Arab Film Symposium (Mogpaafis) was held, bringing together an array of prominent filmmakers and movie experts from across the globe, including other parts of Northeast Africa and the Arab world, as well as [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. Held annually in [[Mogadishu]], the capital of [[Somalia]], the film festival was organized by the [[Somali Film Agency]], the nation's film regulatory body.&lt;ref name="CEC"&gt;Commission of the European Communities, ''The Courier'', Issue 101, (Commission of the European Communities: 1987), p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Film Festival of Marrakech]] (FIFM) is an international [[film festival]] held annually in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]]. Since its inaugural year in 2000, the FIFM has been one of the biggest events devoted to [[Cinema of Morocco|Moroccan cinema]]. It is also the site of the [[principal photography]] of many international productions. The festival's jury gathers international writers, actors and personalities, and endeavors to reward the best Moroccan and foreign [[Feature film|feature]] and [[short film]]s. The FIFM is chaired by [[Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco]].

[[File:Dubai-Filmfestival-2010.jpg|thumb|20m wide [[Inflatable movie screen|inflatable projection screen]] at the 2010 [[Dubai International Film Festival]].]]
The [[Dubai International Film Festival]] (DIFF) is an international [[film festival]] based in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. Launched in 2004, it aims to foster the growth of filmmaking in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="DIFFa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaifilmfest.com/index.php/en/about/intro/|title=Dubai International Film Festival|work=Dubai International Film Festival|access-date=2011-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525111646/http://www.dubaifilmfest.com/index.php/en/about/intro|archive-date=2011-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DIFF is held under the honorary Chairmanship of [[Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum]]. It is a not-for-profit cultural event, presented and organised by the [[Dubai Internet City|Dubai Technology, Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority]].

The DIFF presents cinematic excellence from around the world and offers a high-profile platform for aspiring home-grown talent. The Muhr Award for Excellence in Arab Cinema was launched in 2006, with the aim of recognizing Arab filmmakers both regionally and internationally. In 2008, the Muhr Awards for Excellence were expanded to include two separate competitions, the Arab Muhr Award, and the AsiaAfrica Muhr Award. It also introduced a new program segment dedicated exclusively to Animation.

The [[Abu Dhabi Film Festival]] (ADFF) is another key international film festival in the larger Arab region. Created in 2007, the ceremony is held annually in October in [[Abu Dhabi]], UAE by the [[Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage]] (ADACH), under the patronage of Sheikh Sultan Bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, Chairman of the ADACH. The ADFF aims to encourage and foster the growth of filmmaking in the [[Arab world]] by showcasing movies from the region alongside standout productions from prominent international filmmakers.&lt;ref name="Adff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abudhabifilmfestival.ae/en/about|title=About - Sanad Abu Dhabi Film Fund|work=Abu Dhabi Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first festival debuted with 152 movies and 186 screenings shown in five Abu Dhabi venues. A total of 76 feature films and 34 short films from over 35 countries competed for the Black Pearl Awards.

The [[Doha Tribeca Film Festival]] (DTFF) is an annual five-day [[film festival]] founded in 2009 to promote [[Arab]] and international film, and to develop a sustainable [[film industry]] in [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=412351&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16 Article in Gulf Times January 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128162702/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=412351&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16 |date=2011-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival is one of Qatar's largest entertainment events attracting over 50,000 guests in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dohafilminstitute.com/filmfestival/festival|title=About — Ajyal Youth Film Festival - Doha Film Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DTFF is the annual film festival of the [[Doha Film Institute]], an organisation founded by [[Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani|H.E. Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/MEDIA_179834.html|title=Qatar launches new film institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which implements, consolidates and oversees film initiatives in Qatar.

The 3rd annual DTFF is scheduled to take place from October 25–29, 2011 at Katara Cultural Village, [[Doha]]. Approximately 40 films will screen at the festival, within various themed sections, showcasing World and Middle Eastern Cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/32/18816/Arts--Culture/Film/El-Shouq-to-participate-in-Doha-Tribeca-Film-Festi.aspx|title=El Shouq to participate in Doha Tribeca Film Festival|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support initiatives==
In conjunction with the European Audiovisual Entrepreneurs (EAVE) professional training, networking and project development organization, the Dubai International Film Festival in 2010 also began offering to filmmakers the Interchange group of development and co-production workshops earmarked for directors, screenwriters and producers from the larger Arab region.&lt;ref name="DIFF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaifilmfest.com/index.php/en/dubai_film_market/film-forum/interchange/|title=Dubai International Film Festival|work=Dubai International Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Abu Dhabi Film Festival launched the SANAD development and post-production fund for cineastes from the Arab world. With the goal of encouraging independent and [[Auteur theory|auteur]]-based cinema, eligible filmmakers now have access to financial grants, screenwriting and pitch workshops, and personal meetings with industry mentors and experts.&lt;ref name="Afacadff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abudhabifilmfestival.ae/sites/default/files/press_releases/PR_AFACSANADLab_En.pdf |format=PDF |title=AFAC and Abu Dhabi Film Festival Partner to Support Arab Documentaries Through the SANAD FilmLab |website=abudhabifilmfestival.ae |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903044458/http://www.abudhabifilmfestival.ae/sites/default/files/press_releases/PR_AFACSANADLab_En.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bedevil''''' is a 1993 Australian [[horror film]] directed by [[Tracey Moffatt]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/147653/Bedevil/overview |title=NY Times: Bedevil |accessdate=13 April 2010|work=NY Times | first=Terrence | last=Rafferty}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first feature directed by an Australian Aboriginal woman. With this film, Moffatt challenges racial stereotypes in Australian society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.creativespirits.info/resources/movies/bedevil|title=Bedevil (beDevil)|last=Spirits|first=Jens Korff, Creative|website=Creative Spirits|language=en-AU|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is a trilogy of surreal ghost stories. Inspired by ghost stories she heard as a child from both her extended Aboriginal and Irish Australian families, Tracey Moffatt has constructed a sublime trilogy in which characters are haunted by the past and bewitched by memories. All three stories are set in Moffatt’s highly stylized, hyper-real, hyper-imaginary Australian landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c109.shtml|title=WOMEN MAKE MOVIES {{!}} Bedevil|website=www.wmm.com|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2612/year/1993.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Bedevil |accessdate=22 August 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

=== Mr. Chuck ===
''Mr. Chuck'' is the first of the three-part series featured in ''BeDevil''. It tells the story of a young indigenous boy haunted by the ghost of an American GI who drowned in the swamp around which much of this segment takes place. Various nonlinear events of the boy’s childhood are presented through the perspectives of two narrators: the boy as an older man reflecting on his youth and a white woman whose family took part in the colonization of this area of Australia. The film follows the young boy as he observes and interacts with white settlers who are building a cinema on top of the swamp, while simultaneously holding a caretaker position to his two younger siblings, experiencing abuse at the hands of adults in his family, and having episodic interactions with the ghost of the American GI. These clips of memory are framed by the two narrators’ alternating recounting of them, presented in the style of a documentary interview.

=== Choo Choo Choo Choo ===
In the desolate plains of outback Queensland, Ruby (played by Moffatt herself) and her family are haunted by invisible trains which run on a track beside their house. The ghost of a young girl killed by a train drives Ruby and her family away. After many years Ruby returns to experience the ghostly presence yet again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Lovin' the Spin I'm in ===
Imelda’s people are Torres Strait Islanders. When her son Bebe and his love, Minnie, leave their community to escape opposition to their marriage, Imelda follows them to a small town in north Queensland. Tragedy strikes - Bebe and Minnie die, but the doomed couple never find peace. The spirits of Minnie and Bebe dance on a condemned warehouse and refuse to leave.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Themes==
Storytelling is a central concern of ''beDevil''. Creating and sharing stories is a way to make sense of the world, and both encourages and reflects connections between the past and the present, and people and places. Through the process of telling us their stories, each of the narrators in ''beDevil'' recount shared tales, a sort of modern folklore. While this brings to mind the importance of storytelling to Indigenous traditions, Moffatt explicitly states that these stories “come from both sides of my background – my white relatives as well as my black relatives.” Yet she also insists that “I don’t think you can call the stories particularly white or Aboriginal”. The hybrid nature of Moffatt’s work reflects the way that she perceives the multicultural make-up of Australian society, and she explains that “it is completely natural for me to represent that mixing of races”. ''beDevil'' is very much about ''her'' stories, weaving together “a personal mythology”, and presenting images that are “so personal that a lot of the time they embarrass me”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2016/beyond-the-babadook/tracey-moffatt-bedevil-1993/|title=Tracey Moffatt’s beDevil (1993) • Senses of Cinema|website=sensesofcinema.com|language=en-US|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EugeneBurger Candle byMichaelCaplan.jpg|thumb|alt=A portrait of Eugene Burger.|[[Eugene Burger]] was an American Bizarre Magician.]]
'''Bizarre magic''' (or '''bizarre magick''') is a branch of [[stage magic]], like [[stage illusions]], [[sleight of hand]], or [[children's magic]]. The major difference is that bizarre magic uses [[storytelling]] and [[word play]] to a much greater degree, and less emphasis is placed on the manual dexterity of the performer or the complexity of his equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Gordon, Making It Bizarre Vol 1, 1999, The Amagarion Press, Coalville, UK&lt;/ref&gt; The experience is intended to be more akin to small, intimate theater than a conventional magic show.

==Presentational style==
Bizarre Magicians often use authentic antique or simulated artifacts to enhance their presentations. Storytelling is also employed for a greater sense of theatrical authenticity. Techniques such as these distinguish Bizarre from other types of magic performance. [[Max Maven]] has said of Bizarre Magic that it "references a larger magical world beyond the boundaries of the performance."&lt;ref&gt;Maven, Max. Quoted in Burger, Eugene (1991). “Strange Ceremonies.” Published by Kaufman and Company, Washington D.C. (p, 38).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bizarre magic often uses horror and supernatural imagery in addition to the standard commercial magic approaches of comedy and wonder. Bizarre magic deliberately utilizes discomfort for theatrical effect.&lt;ref&gt;David Parr, Genii Magazine, Oct 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Another methodology employed in performance is the integration of storytelling enhanced by magic.&lt;ref&gt;What is Bizarre? Nigel Gordon 1998, The Amagarion Press, Coalville UK&lt;/ref&gt; Bizarre Magic is often performed as [[close-up magic]], for a few people at a time, but it can also be performed as a club show or even as a stage act, depending on the routine, the props, and the performer.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==History==
{{unrefsection|date=September 2018}}
The movement of the art of Bizarre Magic began in the late 1960s with [[Charles Cameron (magician)|Charles Cameron]] and [[Tony "Doc" Shiels]]. Some of the significant artists since that time have been [[Tony Andruzzi]] (aka Maskelyn ye Mage), [[Eugene Burger]], [[Christian Chelman]], [[Robert Neale (paperfolder)|Robert Neale]], and [[Jeff McBride]].

Most of the material on the subject is published privately within the Bizarre Magic community and is not readily available through normal distribution. And many of the important works were either hand-made or published on a very limited basis. So despite being relatively recent publications, many have significant collectible value.

Contemporary British practitioners include Todd Landman, Iain Jay, Michael Murray, Nick Brunger, Stuart Burrell, Ashton Carter, Steve Drury and Dale Shrimpton.

==Annual events==
{{unrefsection|date=September 2018}}
There are a few annual events focused on Bizarre Magic. The first event was the now defunct "Invocational" which started a tradition of annual gatherings in honor of the Bizarre. In Edinburgh, Scotland the annual Charles Cameron Gathering is held in October. Also in October is the Magic and Meaning Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. England's most popular convention for bizarre magicians is "Doomsday" - being held in Dracula's favourite seaside town, Whitby. It moves to a new location in 2019 after being held for the final time there in May 2018. Since 2015, The East Coast Spirit Sessions is held in January in Myrtle Beach,SC. In 2018, the first annual Mid-Atlantic Bizarre Hauntings Conference was held.

The [[Los Angeles Times Syndicate]] launched ''The Legend of Bruce Lee'' [[comic strip]], featuring fictional stories about the deceased actor and [[martial artist]], in May 1982. 

The syndicate had originally approached veteran comic strip creators [[Milton Caniff]] and [[Noel Sickles]] about doing a Bruce Lee strip in 1978. The project never got off the ground, and five years later the syndicate tried again.&lt;ref name=Holtz&gt;Holtz, Allan. [http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2009/12/obscurity-of-day-legend-of-bruce-lee.html "Obscurity of the Day: The Legend of Bruce Lee,"] ''Stripper's Guide'' (December 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Intended for "downscale, . . . very young audiences," ''The Legend of Bruce Lee'' was intended to "help boost newspaper circulation by attracting younger or less well-educated readers who don't normally read newspapers."&lt;ref name=TCJ&gt;"LATS to Release Bruce Lee Strip," ''The Comics Journal'' #73 (July 1982), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; It was written by [[Sharman DiVono]] (who herself had martial arts training),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=DI+VONO%2c+SHARMAN "Sharman Di Vono,"] ''Who's Who of American Comic Books: 1928–1999''.

Accessed Nov. 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; (with uncredited assists from [[Dick Kulpa]]). 

''The Legend of Bruce Lee'' only ran until late 1982 or early 1983.&lt;ref name=Holtz /&gt;

The strips were collected by Nostalgia World in 1983 in two 24-page magazine-sized issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.comics.org/series/73109/ ''The Legend of Bruce Lee''], Grand Comics Database. Accessed Oct. 15, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cheerleader Queens''''' ({{lang-th|ว้ายบึ้ม! เชียร์กระหึ่มโลก}}; aka '''''I'm Lady''''') is a 2003 [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai film]] directed by [[Poj Arnon]].

== Plot ==
Four [[kathoey]]—Mod, Som, Kam-pang and Wa-wa—move from a rural town to attend St. Mary's High School in [[Bangkok]]. Once there they try to join the school's [[cheerleading]] team, only to be rejected because of their sexuality. Instead they join the school's struggling [[Rugby football|rugby]] team, making friends with the other team members after they score a number of [[Try|tries]] in an important game.

Toey, another kathoey from the boys hometown, comes to Bangkok with the idea of forming a new cheerleading team, which they name "The Queen". From the start the boys have to face a number of problems, but with the help of their friends on the rugby team they manage to get to the finals of the national cheerleading competition.

== Reception ==
Ronnie Scheib of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewed ''Cheerleader Queens'' at the 2004 [[New York Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, &amp; Transgender Film Festival]]. He described the film as, "A fun date flick for all persuasions, with sexual content limited to a few chaste kisses and endless eye-batting innuendo, kitschy curio should perform cheerily on the gay fest circuit."&lt;ref&gt;Scheib, Ronnie. "[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117924248.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 Cheerleader Queens]". ''Variety'', 29 June 2004. Retrieved on 2 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Chicago'' was established in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chicago Tribune Buys Chicago Magazine From Primedia|url=http://www.writenews.com/chicago-tribune-buys-chicago-magazine-from-primedia-80220023|accessdate=25 August 2016|work=The Write News|date=2 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded as the programming guide for the classical radio station [[WFMT]] and was called ''Chicago Guide''. The name was changed in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/chicago/oclc/2398937|work=WorldCat|publisher=OCLC, Inc.|title=Chicago|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, ''Chicago'' introduced the [[Nelson Algren]] Award, a short story contest that the magazine later abandoned before it was picked up by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-09-19/features/8503030764_1_pen-american-center-chicago-writer-stories|work=Chicago Tribune| title=Pen Also Offers A Nelson Algren Award Of ,000 To Struggling|date=19 September 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1986, Chicago Educational Television Association, which had owned WFMT and [[WTTW]], announced that it would sell the magazine for $17 million to a joint venture formed by Metropolitan Detroit Magazine and [[Stephen Adams (business)|Adams Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Charles|last=Storch|title=THE CHICAGO MAGAZINE STORY HOW DEAL PUT DETROIT OUTFIT IN, LEFT OTHERS PUT OUT|work=Chicago Tribune|page=1|date=January 18, 1987|accessdate=24 December 2011|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-01-18/business/8701050440_1_metropolitan-detroit-magazine-kirk-cheyfitz-wfmt-fm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal closed in January 1987. [[Landmark Media Enterprises|Landmark Communications]] bought the magazine in 1990.

''Chicago'' magazine's first editor was Allen Kelson.  He later became editor-in-chief, and then publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Storch |title=Publisher out of bidding |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=C4 |date=September 11, 1986 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Don Gold, the former managing editor of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, became the magazine's editorial director, in a new position created between editor-in-chief Allen Kelson and editor John Fink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Sneed |author2=Cheryl Lavin |title=Our way or we won't play... |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=2 |date=June 24, 1984 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1986 until 1991, Hillel Levin served as the magazine's editor.  He left in early 1991 to join other investors in buying a Miami-based and Caribbean media group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=George |last=Lazarus |title=Alcohol-education campaign derailed |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=2 |date=January 18, 1991 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Levin was succeeded by Richard Babcock, who up to that point had been assistant managing editor of [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=George |last=Lazarus |title=Busch to roll out Natural Pilsner |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=4 |date=March 20, 1991 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, it was announced that longtime ''Chicago'' restaurant critic Dennis Ray Wheaton would be leaving his position and that Jeff Ruby would replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rosner, Helen |title=Jeff Ruby Replaces Dennis Ray Wheaton as Chicago Mag's Restaurant Critic|url=http://chicago.grubstreet.com/2009/12/jeff_ruby_replaces_dennis_ray.html |work=GrubStreet.com |date=December 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Richard Babcock stepped down as ''Chicago''′s editor after exactly 20 years in the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/towerticker/2011/03/babcock-to-step-down-as-editor-of-chicago-magazine-after-20-years.html | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Babcock to step down as editor of Chicago magazine after 20 years | date=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2011, the magazine named Beth Fenner to replace Babcock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/chicago-media-blog/14918325/chicago-magazines-new-editor-ive-been-reading-it-for-years |title=Chicago magazine's new editor: 'I've been reading |publisher=Time Out Chicago |date=2011-08-30 |accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, ''Chicago'' magazine's managing editor, Shane Tritsch, resigned after 18 years with the magazine after he was passed over for the top editorial post there.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Marek, [http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20111216/NEWS06/111219810/managing-editor-tritsch-departs-chicago-magazine  "Managing Editor Tritsch departs Chicago magazine"], ''Crain's Chicago Business'', December 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, longtime ''Chicago'' magazine senior writer Marcia Froelke Coburn left ''Chicago'' magazine to join ''[[Time Out Chicago]]'' as a contributing writer.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Feder, [https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=406660196038882&amp;id=175146445841142 "CBS 2 welcomes reporter back home to Chicago"], Facebook, June 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, longtime ''Chicago'' magazine senior editor Nora O'Donnell left the magazine to join ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine in southern California as senior editor and research chief.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cision.com/us/2016/01/nora-odonnell-named-deputy-editor-at-the-red-bulletin/&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, ''Chicago'' magazine's No. 2 editor, Cassie Walker Burke, left the magazine to join ''[[Crain's Chicago Business]]'' as an assistant managing editor.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Feder, [http://www.robertfeder.com/2014/03/09/another-chicago-editor-jumps-to-crains/ "Another Chicago editor jumps to Crain's"], March 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, ''Chicago'' magazine's award-winning features editor, David Bernstein, took a buyout and left the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.robertfeder.com/2015/11/13/tribune-editor-on-buyouts-emotional-time-as-we-say-goodbye/&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the magazine's editor, Beth Fenner, was fired after more than four years, and the magazine's publisher, Tom Conradi, also was removed from his post.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.robertfeder.com/2016/03/11/susanna-homan-named-editor-and-publisher-of-chicago-magazine/&lt;/ref&gt;  In their places, Susanna Homan was named editor and publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marek|first1=Lynne|title=Splash publisher Susanna Homan taking over Chicago magazine|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160311/NEWS07/160319958/splash-publisher-susanna-homan-taking-over-chicago-magazine|publisher=Crain’s Chicago Business|date=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circus is one of the most active Finnish group touring abroad, having appeared in theaters and in cultural festivals in about thirty countries.&lt;ref name="byunews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ciraerpage"/&gt; Circo Aereo has been called  “a sparkling tribute to the circus” ([[Le Figaro]], France), “half circus, half cabaret” ([[Le Monde]], France) and “a treasure chest full of the things of which circus is made, filled with beautiful sights, meticulous joint efforts and inventive surprises” ([[Helsingin Sanomat]], Finland) .&lt;ref name="byunews"/&gt; Circo Aereo also has held workshops for schools and circus performers, along with other educational projects.&lt;ref name="ciraerpage"/&gt;

In order to develop the concept of the traditional circus, Circo Aereo incorporates other art forms into its shows, such as elements of theatre and dance, with audience interaction playing an important part. Super 8 was created in 2004, which combined traditional magic tricks, super 8 films and elements of video games. Trippo was also created in 2004 and geared for children, playing mostly in [[Scandinavia]]n countries and France.&lt;ref name="ciraerpage"/&gt;

In 2005, Circo Aereo created two musically dominant shows. The first was called the Louisiana Circus, co produced with the UMO Jazz Orchestra and in collaboration with [[Fritt Fall Rinne Radio]], a Finnish electro-jazz band. This production consisted of six artists and twenty musicians, combining circus with a cabaret atmosphere.&lt;ref name="ciraerpage"/&gt;

In 2007, an air show called “Piece for Two Ropes” opened, choreographed by [[Sanna Silvernnoinen]] and another show called FUR! by Maksim Komaro, both with the aim of combining contemporary circus and contemporary dance. In the latter production, artists from various countries, traditions and specialties created their own variations of traditional movements. Circo Aereo has worked with Sirque, pole circus Nexon in [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]] since 2007.&lt;ref name="ciraerpage"/&gt;

Circo Aereo’s most recent production is called “Espresso,” which is performed along with French juggling group [[Les Objets Volants]]. The show features four artists who create scenes and stories, on the ground and in the air, with juggling, dance and aerials, but no words.&lt;ref name="byunews"/&gt; According to director Maksim Komaro, Espresso is a journey through the history of circus, following Komaros own circus experience from the traditional to [[cabaret]] and the contemporary circus of Europe.&lt;ref name="tourusa"&gt; {{cite press release |title= Circo Aereo on tour in USA |publisher= Kulttuurivienti |location= Finland |date= October 1, 2009 |url= http://www.kulttuurivienti.fi/news.php?aid=15281 |accessdate= September 14, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120401010504/http://www.kulttuurivienti.fi/news.php?aid=15281 |archivedate= April 1, 2012 |df=  }} &lt;/ref&gt;   Espresso is one of Circo Aereo's biggest successes.&lt;ref name="wabash"&gt; {{cite press release |title= The Circus is Coming to Town |publisher=Wabash College |date= February 24, 2011  |url= http://www.wabash.edu/news/displaystory.cfm?news_ID=8733 |accessdate=September 14, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt;  Helsingin Sanomat called the work “a treasure chest filled with beautiful sights, meticulous efforts and inventive surprises,” while  Le Monde said, “intelligence and virtuosity are embedded in the magical vignettes.”&lt;ref name="george"/&gt;

The show was created in 2006, touring for three years in and around Europe especially in the [[Parc de la Villette]] in Paris, at the [[Théâtre de Vidy-Lausanne]] in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Damascus Opera House]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="ciraerpage"/&gt; In 2009, the show and the circus itself made its North American debut, performing eight eastern U.S. states.

'''''Dead Kansas''''' is a 2013 five-part [[webseries]], written, directed, and produced by Aaron K. Carter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horrorsociety.com/2015/02/12/dead-kansas-review/ Dead Kansas (Review) | Horror Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In a post-apocalyptic land consumed by ''Rottens'', a simple farmer and his teenage daughter struggle to survive. Meanwhile, an unruly gang make a plan to kidnap and sell the daughter for their own selfish profit. With the farmer/gang confrontation, a wicked tornado approaching, and "Rottens" everywhere - who will get out alive?

* Erin Miracle – Emma

==Filming locations==
Dead Kansas was filmed in [[Los Angeles, California]], primarily around the [[San Fernando Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/deadkansas Dead Kansas Facebook Page]&lt;/ref&gt; A portion was filmed at a circus-themed bar called, [[California Institute of Abnormalarts]]. It is located at 11334 Burbank Blvd, in [[North Hollywood, California]] 91601.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorestruly.com/2015/01/08/slasher-shorts-dead-kansas/ Slasher Shorts: Dead Kansas]&lt;/ref&gt; Every room is decorated with an eclectic assortment of ugly dolls, strange wall hangings, clowns, skeletons, and other spooky Halloween themed relics. CIA almost has a museum-like feel. Production was permitted only 4 hours to film there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://horrorunlimited.blogspot.de/2014/06/dead-kansas-award-winning-zombie-series.html  'Dead Kansas' ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rottens==
[[Zombies]] are referred to as "Rottens" in ''Dead Kansas''. There is only one physical zombie, in full make-up, towards the end of the film. The other Rottens are never shown. They are only simulated via Point Of View (POV) in black &amp; white. The camera acted as the Rotten's eyes in certain shots, while the actors reacted. As tempting as it was to use traditional make-up and show the Rottens, the director specifically chose POV to do something different. Dead Kansas is the first zombie film to extensively use POV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talentmonthly.com/112014_DEAD_KANSAS Dead Kansas - Talent Monthly Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The pilot of the webseries premiered on September 24, 2012 on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://angryprincessslashes.blogspot.de/2014/05/aaron-carters-5-act-zombie-web-series.html Aaron Carters 5 act zombie web series Titled Dead Kansas]&lt;/ref&gt; All five acts were eventually tied together and released on DVD as a full-length film in October 2013.  The film version of the series, screened at the 2014 [[FANtastic Horror Film Festival]] - where it won an award for Best Zombie Film.  Dead Kansas was released on [[Amazon Video]], February 26, 2015.

==Soundtrack==
The punk-rock music heard throughout the film is from the band Power Of Aggression. They are from the Hollywood area and were active during 1999 through the early 2000's. The band was originally called Gauntlet in the early-90’s with former members Daniel Gallagher &amp; Eddy Darbinian on guitars with Matthew Muller on bass guitar.  The band eventually reformed in 1999, changed their name to Power of Aggression and adopted most of the songs from Gauntlet. Original member and chief-songwriter Anthony Robinson played lead guitar &amp; vocals, Adam Ledezma played drums and Aaron K. Carter played bass guitar. When a soundtrack was needed, producers Aaron K. Carter and Adam Ledezma used the Power Of Aggression demo-tape that they recorded over a decade ago. The songs featured in Dead Kansas include: "The Ruler", "Walls Of Insanity", "Hate", "The Way We Feel", "Behold the Terror", and "Now".  Composer Jonathan Price provided the rest of the music score.

'''EXIT''' were a [[performance art]] group during the mid-1970s. EXIT members [[Penny Rimbaud]] and [[Gee Vaucher]] later founded [[anarchist]] [[punk rock]] band [[Crass]], adopting many of EXIT's experimental/multi media techniques into Crass' presentation. 

Rimbaud acknowledges that EXIT in turn had been involved with the [[Fluxus]] Movement (of which [[Yoko Ono]] was a member). He also states that Crass was more influenced by the [[avant-garde]] than by any [[rock &amp; roll]] precedent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3135">'''Electronic Media Monitoring Centre''' (EMMC) is a subordinate office under the [[India]]n [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]] tasked to monitor content of [[television channels]] and report on violations of the programme and advertising code.

== History ==
The centre was set up on 9 June 2008, by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] led [[United Progressive Alliance|UPA government]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/for-media-monitor-work-is-counting-pm-ministers-on-tv/article7669172.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working==
The violations committed by channels are interpreted along the lines of the programme code of the Cable Television Networks Rules (1994) which under Section 6 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mib.nic.in/WriteReadData/documents/pc1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; lists the several don'ts that the channels have to conform to, failing which, they shall be issued a [[show cause]] notice. The sweeping provisions under the aforementioned act ask channels not to offend good taste, decency or attack religions or communities. Nor should they carry anything that is likely to encourage or incite violence or anything that goes against the maintenance of law and order. Specifically, the code says programmes should not telecast anything amounting to contempt of court; They should contain aspersions on the integrity of the [[President]] and the [[judiciary]], criticise, malign, or slander any individual in person or certain groups,segments of social, public and moral life of the country. This is the code that the EMMC follows as it looks for transgressions and airtime to ministers. 
According to sources, "It is the tracking of ministers that consumes all the time, and prevents a proper monitoring of channels" It is here that officials watch out for television channels, about 600 of them, tripping on the programme code, drawn up by the government, offering the I&amp;B ministry reasons to serve show cause notices on the channels. The EMMC monitors 'around 600' TV channels on a day-to-day basis. The penalties vary, depending on the degree of violation. On 2 March 2015, [[Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore]], the [[Minister of State]] for the Information and Broadcasting Ministry in a query stated that there were at least three instances in 2015 against channels over violations of the Programming and Advertising Code: While in one case, an order was issued to take a channel off air for seven days, in another case, a warning was issued. In another instance, a show cause notice was issued. According to [[Arun Jaitley]], over 20 channels were banned for flouting of rules over the last 20 years. In January 2015, an amount of Rs.20 krore was allocated in the financial year 2014-15 for facilitating augmentation of the monitoring capacity of the EMMC. By 2017, the Government hopes to increase the capacity of the EMMC to about 1500 channels.

The '''Ertl Company''' is an American [[toy]] company best known for its [[Die-cast toy|die-cast]] metal alloy collectible replicas (or [[scale models]]) of [[farm equipment]] and vehicles. The company is based in Dyersville, Iowa, home of the [[National Farm Toy Museum]].

==Plastic model kits==
In the late 1970s, Ertl offered a series of plastic model kits of heavy commercial trucks, over-the-road trailers, tractors, plows, and farm wagons. Although these kits never achieved the hoped-for popularity, they led to the acquisition of [[Aluminum Metal Toys|AMT.]] In 1983, AMT was purchased by Ertl from Lesney, and renamed AMT/Ertl. AMT/Ertl then had a 24-year relationship until AMT was sold in 2007.

==American muscle diecast==
In the early 1990s Ertl started the American Muscle line up of diecast collectible cars and trucks.  These were 1:18 scale replicas that quickly found a dedicated following of baby boomers.  Limited editions of 2,500 were especially sought after.  Many of the earliest releases have fetched upwards of $500.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The most popular and desirable is the [[1957 Chevrolet|1957 Chevy]] [[Chevrolet Bel Air|Bel Air]] known as Peggy Sue.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Die cast [[Airplane model|airplanes]]==
Ertl has also produced a number of die cast airplane models over the years, including some promotional items for [[Texaco]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.3000toys.com/catalog/products.aspx?MFG=ERTL&amp;ORDER=M&amp;TYPE=Aircraft&amp;setup=&lt;/ref&gt; [[Continental Airlines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continental Airlines DC-3 by Ertl F154 with stand|website=Randy's Diecast|url=http://randysdiecast.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=13&amp;products_id=1021&amp;zenid=04f2a0269dde30ead5d937caf1f6dac0|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150702105139/http://randysdiecast.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=13&amp;products_id=1021 |archivedate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

==History==
Ertl has been producing farm toy replicas since 1945. For over 60 years, the company has produced farm toys for industry brands such as: [[John Deere]], [[Case IH]], [[New Holland Ag|New Holland]], and [[AGCO]]. Ertl has also, on different occasions, acquired the licenses to produce die-cast vehicles and [[figurine]]s as well as [[scale model|model kits]] for [[Looney Tunes]], [[Garfield]], [[Thomas the Tank Engine]], [[Tugs (TV series)]], [[Super Mario Bros (film)|Super Mario Bros.]] [[DC Comics]], and [[Star Wars]].  In 1999, Ertl was purchased by [[Racing Champions]]. Ertl is currently a brand under the [[RC2 Corporation]] umbrella.

Lambert's Puppet Theatre also produced the iconic children's television character [[Bosco (TV series)|Bosco]]. He died in 2010 at the age of 81.

==Career==
Lambert was long a stalwart of the Irish [[vaudeville]] scene, particularly in Dublin, although he also toured the country frequently with his wife Mai. His most common acts were with Finnegan, a mischievous storyteller, and Judge, a pensive dog. With the rise of television in the 1960s, the Lambert puppet theatre became a fixture in Irish broadcasting. In the early 1960s, Lambert devised a puppet series for children entitled ''Murphy agus a Chairde'' ("Murphy and His Friends"). Murphy was a giant who lived in a magical kingdom. Its king, "An Rí", only had one problem - constant mischief from two witches, Feemy and Babóg. [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] was the only station most people in Ireland could then access and Murphy's adventures were soon an important part of most children's viewing. Murphy himself appeared as the in-vision continuity announcer all through one of RTÉ's Christmas Day broadcasts.

In November 1963, Lambert drew international attention after he successfully acquired a driver's license for his puppet Finnegan. Lambert reported that he did so simply to show how easy it was for anybody in Ireland to obtain a license.

He later co-starred in the children's television series ''[[Wanderly Wagon]]'' as the mischievous and greedy O'Brien, known for his childlike curiosity and cowardice in the face of magical events. Lambert and his family provided many regular (puppet) characters — Judge the dog, Mr Crow (who lived in a cuckoo clock), the mysterious Foxy Loxy, and the untrustworthy Ssneaky Ssnake.&lt;ref name="indo-obit-2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/puppeteer-leaves-a-loving-legacy-of-laughter-2076416.html|title=Puppeteer leaves a loving legacy of laughter|author=Jason O'Brien|date=24 February 2010|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also featured Irish actor [[Frank Kelly]] who played Dr Astro in the series, who later appeared as Fr. Jack Hackett in ''[[Father Ted]]''.

Another series created by Eugene Lambert was adapted from a children's book by [[Patricia Lynch]], ''Brógeen Follows The Magic Tune.'' Brógeen was a leprechaun who teamed up with a fiddler who had heard a piece of music created by the fairies - and they wanted it back. The series was a great success and won several awards internationally. Some years later, when Lambert enquired about the 2" master video tapes, RTÉ admitted to having re-used them. ''Brogeen'' (and most of ''Wanderly Wagon'') was gone forever, although a dubbed version of ''Brogeen'' still exists in the archives of [[NRK]].

==Lambert Puppet Theatre and Museum==
The [[Lambert Puppet Theatre]] was established in 1972. Eugene Lambert founder and Director of the Lambert Puppet Theatre had an interest in puppetry from a very early age, making his own ventriloquist dummy Charley, which later developed into Finnegan the ventriloquist act. In the early years with Finnegan, Eugene toured UK and Ireland extensively and in later years he promoted Ireland for Irish Tourist Board, touring USA, Japan and Australia.&lt;ref name="J O'S Irish Inde 24 Feb 2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/a-showman-who-kept-a-generation-entertained-2076362.html|title=A showman who kept a generation entertained|author=[[Joe O'Shea]]|date=24 February 2010|work=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambert's Puppet Theatre was responsible for producing the popular 1980s children's television character [[Bosco (TV series)|Bosco]] who was an ever-present fixture on the Irish national station.

Eugene and Mai Lambert had ten children two of whom predeceased him.&lt;ref name="J O'S Irish Inde 24 Feb 2010" /&gt; Lambert supplemented his day job as refrigeration engineer with his "[[Punch and Judy]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Conor Hunt |date=23 February 2010 |title=Death of Eugene Lambert: News report |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0223/lamberte_av.html?2707083,null,230 |medium=News report |publisher=''[[RTÉ News and Current Affairs|RTÉ News]]'' |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605142808/http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0223/lamberte_av.html?2707083%2Cnull%2C230 |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing in private houses and night time was taken up with appearing with his vent act Finnegan at Gala concerts and Dinners. The Lambert family participated in Jury’s Irish Cabaret for 7 years bringing topical puppet acts to the American audience.

Eugene and his wife Mai visited The Harlequin Puppet Theatre in [[Colwyn Bay]], [[Wales]] and an International Puppet Festival in [[Prague]]. Inspired, they decided to open a puppet theatre of their own, ''The Lambert Puppet Theatre''.

==Death==
Lambert died at his home in Monkstown, County Dublin on Monday 22 February 2010, aged 82.&lt;ref name="RTÉ 23 Feb 10"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0223/lamberte.html|title=Eugene Lambert dies aged 82|date=23 February 2010|work=[[RTÉ News and Current Affairs|RTÉ News]]|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]|accessdate=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Times 23 Feb 10"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0223/breaking8.html?via=mr|title=Puppeteer Eugene Lambert dies aged 82|date=23 February 2010|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=The Irish Times Trust|accessdate=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral on 26 February 2010 was attended by entertainers and politicians, with [[Liam Ó Maonlaí]] and [[Sinéad O'Connor]] singing at his [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and a miniature Wanderly Wagon featuring in the ceremony.&lt;ref name="RTÉ 26 Feb 10"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0226/lamberte.html|title=Eugene Lambert laid to rest|date=26 February 2010|work=[[RTÉ News and Current Affairs|RTÉ News]]|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick John Westcott''' (26 March 1866&amp;nbsp;– 18 September 1941), best known by his stage name '''Fred Karno''', was an English [[theatre]] [[impresario]] of the British [[music hall]].&lt;ref name=up/&gt; As a comedian of [[slapstick]] he is credited with popularizing the [[Pieing|custard-pie-in-the-face gag]].&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Halliwell, John Walker (2001). "Halliwell's Who's who in the Movies". p. 240. HarperCollinsEntertainment, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1890s, in order to circumvent stage censorship, Karno developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue.

Cheeky authority-defying playlets such as ''Jail Mum'' (1896) in which prisoners play tricks on warders and ''Early Birds'' (1903), where a small man defeats a large ruffian in London's East End, can be seen as precursors of movie silent comedy. Film producer [[Hal Roach]] stated: "Fred Karno is not only a genius, he is the man who originated slapstick comedy. We in Hollywood owe much to him."&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Gallagher (1971). "Fred Karno: master of mirth and tears". p. 165. Hale.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the music hall [[comedian]]s who worked for him were [[Charlie Chaplin]] and his [[understudy]], Arthur Jefferson, who later adopted the name of [[Stan Laurel]]. These were part of what was known as "Fred Karno's Army", a phrase still occasionally used in the UK to refer to a chaotic group or organisation. The phrase was also adapted by British soldiers into a [[war song|trench song]] in the [[First World War]], as a [[parody]] of, or rather to the tune of, the [[hymn]] "[[The Church's One Foundation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/education/tutorials/intro/trench/songs.html#fred |title='Trench Songs', The First World War Poetry Digital Archive |accessdate=16 October 2010|quote=We are Fred Karno's army, we are the ragtime infantry.

Mein Gott, what a bloody rotten lot, are the ragtime infantry" |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Second World War]] it was adapted as the Anthem of the [[Guinea Pig Club]], the first line becoming "We are McIndoe's Army&amp;nbsp;...".

==Biography==
Karno was born in [[Exeter]], [[Devon]], England, in 1866. He worked as a cabinet maker with a workshop in Waterbeer Street. He married Edith and in 1896 his son, Fred Karno Jr. was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Fred Karno, Jr. |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0B11F934551B728DDDAD0894DA405B818AF1D3 |quote=Fred Karno, Jr., British comedian, died at his home today in Marg'ate, Kent.

He demolished the original hotel and hired architect [[Frank Matcham]] to build [[The Karsino]].&lt;ref name=thames&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/leisure_and_culture/local_history_and_heritage/local_studies_collection/local_history_notes/fred_karno_and_the_karsino.htm |title=Fred Karno and the Karsino |accessdate=16 October 2010 |publisher=[[Richmond upon Thames]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417024358/http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/leisure_and_culture/local_history_and_heritage/local_studies_collection/local_history_notes/fred_karno_and_the_karsino.htm |archivedate=17 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of [[Film|cinema]], the music hall's popularity declined. As a result of this decline, Karno went [[bankrupt]] in 1925.&lt;ref name=thames/&gt;

On 24 May 1927 his wife Edith, from whom he had been separated since 1904, died in her sleep of [[diabetes]]. Three weeks later, Karno married his second wife, his long-time partner, Marie Moore. Karno went to the US in 1929, and was hired by the [[Hal Roach Studios]] as a writer-director, and was reunited with one of his former protégés, [[Stan Laurel]]. However, his stay at the studio was brief and unsuccessful as [[Hal Roach]] found out Karno's main abilities were as a producer, and he departed in February 1930. On his return to Britain, Karno helped to write and produce several short films and in 1936 returned to the theatre with a show called ''Real Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Book-Stan and Ollie: The Roots of Comedy (Faber and Faber Ltd.) Author-Simon Louvish. Publishing Date-2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karno spent his last years in southwest England in the village of [[Lilliput, Dorset]], as a part-owner of an off-licence bought with financial help from Charlie Chaplin,&lt;ref name="chaplin"&gt;{{cite web| title=Filming City Lights| url=http://www.charliechaplin.com/biography/articles/4-City-Lights| publisher=CharlieChaplin.com| author=David Robinson| year=2004| accessdate=12 May 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122062524/http://charliechaplin.com/biography/articles/4-City-Lights| archivedate=22 November 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and died there in 1941 from diabetes, aged 75.&lt;ref name=up&gt;{{cite news|title=Fred Karno|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1941/09/19/archives/fred-karno.html|work=[[United Press]] in the [[New York Times]]|page=23|date=19 September 1941|quote=Westcott, an old-time comedian and veteran of the English vaudeville circuit known to show business as Fred Karno, died yesterday |accessdate=5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thames/&gt;

[[File:Souls in Pawn.jpg|thumb|''Souls in Pawn'' (1917)]]
'''Gail Kane''' (born '''Abigail Kane''', July 10, 1885 – February 17, 1966) was an American stage and [[silent movie]] actress

==Early years==
Kane was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. She attended a private school in [[Newburgh, New York]], but eschewed additional education to become an actress. She became a dedicated student of the art of [[pantomime]]. She stood 5'7" tall, weighed 142 pounds, and had dark brown hair and eyes.

==Theatrical actress==
Kane performed at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in ''Heap Game Watch'' in January 1914. She had a significant role in ''Seven Keys To Baldpate Astor'', which was staged at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], in May 1914. The comedy was brought to the stage by [[George M. Cohan]]. She paired with George Nash in ''The Miracle Man'' at the [[Astor Theatre, New York City|Astor Theatre]]. The play was produced on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in the fall of 1914.

&lt;!--[[Image:GailKane.jpg|thumb|Gail Kane {{deletable image-caption|Friday, 4 December 2009}}]]--&gt;
Kane acted in a presentation of ''The Hyphen Knickerbocker'' in April 1915. She returned to the stage at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] in July 1920. She was paired with [[Earle Fox]], another actor who had been spending much of his time in movies. They appeared in the comedy ''Come Seven''. The production was an adaptation by [[Octavus Roy Cohen]] of stories he had contributed to ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. The play was the first ever featuring an entirely [[Caucasian race|caucasian]] cast in [[black face]].

''Lawful Larceny'' (1922) was a comedy adapted from the writing of Samuel Shipman. It was presented at the Republic Theater, built by [[Oscar Hammerstein I|Oscar Hammerstein]] in 1900, at [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]. The players included Kane, [[Margaret Lawrence (actress)|Margaret Lawrence]], Ida Waterman, and [[Lowell Sherman]].

''The Breaking Point'' by [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]] was staged at the [[Klaw Theatre]], West 45th Street, [[New York City]], in August 1923. The plot concerned [[amnesia]] with the [[setting (fiction)]] moving from New York to [[Wyoming]] and back. Kane, Regina Wallace, [[Reginald Barlow]], and McKay Morris were the principal actors in the drama.

She played Ellen Halpin in the 1925 comedy ''[[Loggerheads (play)|Loggerheads]]'' at the [[Cherry Lane Theatre]]. The [[Booth Theatre]] produced ''Paid'', written by Sam Forrest, in November 1925. Kane portrayed ''Mrs John Ramsey'' in a play which endured for twenty-one performances.

==Arrest==
Kane was arrested following a performance of ''The Captive'' at the [[Empire Theatre (41st Street)|Empire Theater]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in February 1927. The production was considered indecent and a violation of Section 1140A of the New York City Criminal Code, although the play had been tried and acquitted of immorality a short time earlier by a citizen's play jury. It was in its fifth month of production.

Forty-one arrests were made in total. Two other productions were raided on the same night. They were ''Sex'', playing at Daly's 63rd St. Theater, and ''The Virgin Man'', which was being performed before an audience at the Princess Theater. Among the actors taken to Night Court were [[Basil Rathbone]], [[Helen Menken]], Ann Trevor, Winifred Fraser, John Miltern, and Arthur Lewis. Menken was comforted by Kane as she made her exit after becoming agitated by the glares and explosions of cameras snapping as she stepped out on the sidewalk. "Please make them stop," Menken reportedly exclaimed. Also arrested was [[Mae West]], the star of ''Sex'', and twenty others among a cast of fifty. Authorities promised to repeat the arrests if the plays were not withdrawn or modified to comply with the criminal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1927/02/10/archives/police-raid-three-shows-sex-captives-and-virgin-man-hold-actors-and.html|title=POLICE RAID THREE SHOWS, SEX, CAPTIVES AND VIRGIN MAN; HOLD ACTORS AND MANAGERS; ALL GO TO NIGHT COURT Police Politely Serve the Warrants After the Final Curtains.

==Movie career==
Kane's movie career spanned much of the silent era, beginning with a role as ''Bonita Canby'', in ''Arizona'' (1913). In the western she had the third lead, portraying the unfaithful wife of a [[U.S. Cavalry]] officer. She co-starred as Jurgis Rudkus's (played by George Nash) wife Ona Lukoszaite in the film adaptation of [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle (1914 film)|The Jungle]]'' (1914). She starred in ''Via Wireless'' (1915) which was adapted from a play by [[Winchell Smith]] and Paul Armstrong. The story describes the competition between two men in the invention of a new naval gun. A wealthy man becomes the rival of one of the inventors for the affection of the daughter of an [[ironmaster]]. As ''Frances Durant'', Kane is finally given a part worthy of her skill as an actress. One critic described her as ''a diamond set in brass'' in her previous films. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[File:Gail Kane 1923 Income Letter.jpg|thumb|right|Letter from Inspiration Pictures Inc. informing Gail Kane of her 1923 earnings for [[The White Sister (1923 film)|The White Sister]]']]
Kane was employed by the [[Mutual Film Corporation]] of [[Santa Barbara, California]] when she made ''The Upper Crust'' (1917). Produced by Mutual-American, Edward Pell is cast as Kane's [[leading man]] in a comedy replete with humor. Kane is a young [[Irish people|Irish]] woman named ''Molly O'Toole''. She impersonates a wealthy [[dowager]] and succeeds in her [[deception|ruse]] long enough to enjoy herself and eventually marry the dowager's son.

In July 1917 Kane joined an effort organized by William A. Brady, President of the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry, and [[D.W. Griffith]]. Their task was to utilize film as a tool of information regarding the ''plans and purposes'' of the [[United States]] in [[World War I]]. Brady was appointed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to mobilize the motion-picture industry. Kane was assigned to the Food Commission. In addition to Mutual she was associated with [[Metro Pictures]], [[Pathé]], and World. Kane filed a suit against Mutual in 1918, asking $33,500 for alleged [[breach of contract]].  {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

''The Scarlet Oath'' (1917) was a challenging movie for Kane who played the dual role of two women. ''A Game of Wits'' (1917) is a five-reel comedy with Kane portraying ''Jeannette Browning'' in a unique love story.

She continued to act in motion pictures for another decade. Among her later movies are ''Love's Law'' (1918), ''The Daredevil'' (1918), ''Someone Must Pay'' (1919), ''Romeo's Dad'' (1919), ''Empty Arms'' (1920), ''Idle Hands'' (1921), ''[[The White Sister (1923 film)|The White Sister]]'' (1923), and ''Convoy'' (1927).

==Marriage==
Kane's husband, Henry Iden Ottman, died in January 1939. Ottman was born in New York City in 1880, the son of William Ottman and Christine Iden. Ottman moved to [[Augusta, Maine]] in 1921. Kane and Ottman had a son, William Kane Ottman.

==Private life==
She owned a collection of [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] beetles considered to be one of the finest in America in 1917. The most valuable of the [[Scarabaeus sacer]] is said to have been removed from the tomb of an [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egyptian]] princess of the 2nd [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. Archaeologists believe it to be one of a number issued to illustrate the doctrine of the resurrection. Kane was given her first scarab by [[Howard Estabrook]], who played ''Adhemar de Gratignan'' in ''Divorcons'' (1913). Presented at the New York Playhouse, Kane portrayed ''Mme. de Brionne'' in the play written by the [[France|French]] dramatist [[Victorien Sardou]]. Estabrook purchased the scarab in [[India]] while he was touring. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

She collected bathing suits. Kane possessed one of the most attractive collections of one-piece, two-piece, and ''fluffy ruffles seashore outfits'' in [[Chicago, Illinois]] by 1917. Each bathing suit was also designed by her.

==Death==
Gail Kane died in [[Augusta, Maine]] in 1966, aged 80.

'''George H. Coes''' (1828 – March 16, 1897) was an American [[Minstrel show|minstrel music]] performer.  He appeared in numerous minstrel shows in [[California]] and throughout the [[Northeastern United States]].

==Early life==
Coes was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] in 1828.

==Career in minstrelsy==
Minstrelsy was America's first original contribution to the theater arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bean| first = Annemarie | authorlink = |author2=James Vernon Hatch |author3=Brooks McNamara | title = Inside the minstrel mask: readings in nineteenth-century blackface minstrelsy | publisher = Wesleyan University Press | year = 1996 | location = Hanover, New Hampshire | pages = | url =  | doi =  | id = | isbn = 0-8195-5294-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popular from just before the [[American Civil War]] to the end of the 19th Century.  Today, minstrelsy and its attendant [[blackface]] is viewed as racist and anachronistic; however, it was the preeminent entertainment in the United States during the life of George H. Coes, and he was one of the most well-known and successful performers.&lt;ref name="McCormack"&gt;{{cite news| last = McCormack| first = Mike| title = Luke Schoolcraft's life touches on minstrel shows, composing| work = Terre Haute Tribune-Star| pages = | publisher = | date = February 2, 2003| url = http://specials.tribstar.com/columns/Historical/2003/February2.html| accessdate = August 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Coes went to California in 1852 and was associated with a number of minstrel acts, principally in [[San Francisco]] before returning East and opening with Woods and [[Christy's Minstrels]] in New York City in 1857. In 1858, Coes returned to California and joined with Sam Wells to form Coes and Wells' Minstrels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Rice| first = Edward Leroy | authorlink = | title = Monarchs of Minstrelsy from "Daddy" Rice to Date| publisher = Kenney Publishing Company | year = 1911 | location = New York, New York | pages = 366| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvY5AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=%22George+H.+Coes%22&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPP8,M1 | doi =  | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; That partnership did not last and Coes returned to performing in other companies. In 1867, after years of performing in the minstrel companies of others, Coes joined with [[S.S. Purdy]] and [[Frank Converse (minstrel)|Frank Converse]] to form Coes, Purdy and Converse's Party which opened in [[Harlem]] on March 19, 1867.

===Partnership with Schoolcraft===
Coes joined with his old friend [[Luke Schoolcraft]] in 1874 and they formed "one of the most famous minstrel tandems in history." &lt;ref name="McCormack"/&gt; Schoolcraft &amp; Coes appeared with a number of leading companies including [[Emerson's Megatherian Minstrels]] and [[Barlow, Wilson, Primrose &amp; West]].  By 1880, the two settled with their families in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and continued to tour throughout the country performing their minstrel act in a variety of shows and venues.

When Coes was unable to continue his career due to poor health in 1889, the partnership dissolved.  Coes was stricken with paralysis in 1891 and died at his home at 205 Hampshire Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts on March 16, 1897.

==Compositions==
George H. Coes produced a book of music in 1877, entitled [[George Coes' Album of Music]] which included a number of hits, including:

*Clouds and sunshine; or, I've just arrived from Dixie (1877)

'''Gerard Behar Center''' ({{lang-he|מרכז ז'ראר בכר}}) is a major [[arts centre]] in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], for independent theatre, dance, and musical productions, children's shows, art exhibitions, artist workshops, and festivals. In 2010 the center hosted over 900 events with attendance in excess of 263,600 participants. The center includes two theatres and is home to two dance companies, Kolben and [[Vertigo (dance company)|Vertigo]].

Formerly known as '''Beit Ha'Am''', in 1961 the newly opened site was the venue for the trial of [[Nazism|Nazi]] officer [[Adolf Eichmann]], who sat in a specially-made bulletproof glass booth during the proceedings. After the trial, the building reverted to its use as a cultural center, but in 1983 the complex was upgraded to an arts centre by the [[Jerusalem Foundation]] with funding from Eliezer and Lucie Behar of France, who renamed the center in memory of their son, Gerard, a victim of the Nazis during World War II. In 1987 the Gerard Behar Center was incorporated into the newly named Jacob &amp; Hilda Blaustein Civic Center, which encompasses the two theatres, a dance studio, a municipal library, an [[adult education]] program, and an [[ulpan]].

==History==
Beit Ha'Am ({{lang-he|בית העם}}, literally, "People's House"{{sfn|Patai|2000|p=4}}) was a public cultural program operating in various cities in Israel; it was underway in Jerusalem by 1904.&lt;ref name=nach/&gt; It provided public lectures, cultural evenings, a reading library, and a venue in which people could meet and discuss the issues of the day.&lt;ref name=nach&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nahlaot.co.il/%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%96-%D7%96-%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A8-%D7%91%D7%9B%D7%A8.html|title= מרכז ז'ראר בכר|trans-title=Gerard Behar Center|language=Hebrew|first=Rafi|last=Kefir|publisher=Ahavat Yerushalayim|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking a permanent home, the program moved from place to place in the vicinity of [[Street of the Prophets]], with one of its better-known locations being on Isaiah Street, to the rear of the Histadrut building on [[Straus Street]].&lt;ref name=nach/&gt; In the 1930s and 1940s, Beit Ha'Am convened in various downtown theatres, including the [[Zion Square|Zion Cinema]], the Eden Theater, the Orion Theater, and the Edison Theater,{{sfn|Patai|2000|p=4}}&lt;ref name=nach/&gt; the latter of which had seating for over 2,000.{{sfn|Patai|2000|p=213}} After the establishment of the State of Israel, Beit Ha'Am occupied the Perlstein building at 70 [[Jaffa Road]].&lt;ref name=nach/&gt;

Jewish historian and ethnographer [[Raphael Patai]] was a frequent speaker for the popular lecture series; in his book, ''Journeyman in Jerusalem: Memories and Letters, 1933–1947'', he recalls his well-attended lecture at a commemorative evening for [[Theodor Herzl]] in 1937, a lecture on [[Josephus]] which was not received as well, and a lecture on "Jewish sea battles".{{sfn|Patai|2000|pp=213–216}} In 1944 Patai introduced a Jewish folklore studies component to Beit Ha'Am and was the scientific director for that segment.{{sfn|Patai|2000|p=436}}

In 1950 the cornerstone was laid for a permanent building for Beit Ha'Am on Bezalel Street in the [[Nachlaot]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=nach/&gt; The land had been purchased by the [[Jewish National Fund]] for this purpose, and architect A. Hoffman designed the building.&lt;ref name=nach/&gt; While construction commenced before the declaration of the state of Israel, the project was abandoned with the onset of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli war]].&lt;ref name=behar/&gt; In 1955 the project was taken over by the [[Jerusalem Municipality]], which hired architect [[David Resnick|David Reznik]] to complete the plans.&lt;ref name=nach/&gt; The building was finally completed in 1961.&lt;ref name=jeru&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jerusalem.com/articles/culture_and_politics/the_gerardbehar_center_in_jerusalem-a2085|title=The Gerard-Behar Center in Jerusalem|publisher=Jerusalem.com|date=3 May 2013|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial of Adolf Eichmann==
[[File:Adolf Eichmann at Trial1961.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Adolf Eichmann]] sits in a bulletproof glass booth at his trial]]
With the capture of the Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann in [[Buenos Aires]] and the decision by the Israeli government to try him for [[crimes against humanity]], the newly opened Beit Ha'Am was chosen as the site for the trial, in part due to its ability to accommodate the many journalists and media correspondents expected to attend.{{sfn|Shandler|1999|p=90}} The building was enclosed by a {{convert|10|ft|adj=on}} high security fence and a holding cell for Eichmann was established on-site for the duration of the trial.{{sfn|Shandler|1999|p=90}}&lt;ref name=behar&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-165084941.html

The four-month trial, which began on April 11, 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov.il/archivegov_eng/publications/electronicpirsum/eichmantrial/eichmantrialintroduction.htm |title=The Eichmann Trial: Fifty years after |accessdate=1 April 2016 |publisher=[[Israel State Archives]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407091325/http://www.archives.gov.il/archivegov_eng/publications/electronicpirsum/eichmantrial/eichmantrialintroduction.htm |archivedate=7 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was highly publicized and covered by radio, newspaper, and television journalists from around the world. Of the 756 seats made available in the theatre, 474 were designated for members of the press; journalists also viewed the proceedings via closed-circuit television in an adjacent press room. Another 570 viewers watched on a closed-circuit screen in the nearby Ratisbonne Monastery.{{sfn|Shandler|1999|pp=90–91}} Videotape was flown daily to the United States for broadcast the following day. A [[bulletproof glass]] wall was erected between the stage where the judges sat and the spectator seating, and Eichmann sat inside his own bulletproof glass booth with armed guards at his side.{{sfn|Shandler|1999|p=90}} The trial concluded on August 14, 1961; on December 13 the court found Eichmann guilty of crimes against humanity.

==Renovation==
[[File:Gerard Behar Center2.jpg|left|thumb|Gerard Behar Center entrance]]
Following the Eichmann trial, Beit Ha'Am reverted to its function as a cultural center. In the early 1980s&lt;ref name=jeru/&gt; the Jerusalem Foundation undertook the creation of a major [[arts centre]] on the site and found a donor in Eliezer and Lucie Behar of France. The renovation, designed by David Reznik&lt;ref name=nach/&gt; and completed in 1983, upgraded the theatre in which the Eichmann trial had taken place into a 650-seat performance venue for theatre, music, and dance, and added a second, 200-seat theatre to the complex.&lt;ref name=behar/&gt; Both theatres are handicapped accessible.&lt;ref name=jeru/&gt; The theatre complex was renamed the Gerard Behar Center in memory of the donors' son, who had been murdered by the Nazis.&lt;ref name=behar/&gt;&lt;ref name=jeru/&gt; A circular plaza fronting the entrance was also created in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.jerusalemfoundation.org/culture/theater/an-pritzker-plaza.aspx |title=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4189">'''Gevacolor''' is a [[Color motion picture film|color motion picture]] process. It was established in 1948, originally based in [[Belgium]] and an affiliate of [[Agfacolor]]. The process and company flourished in the 1950s as it was suitable for on location shooting. Both the companies merged in 1964 to form [[Agfa-Gevaert]], and continued producing film stock till the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts|author=Susan Hayward|publisher=Routledge |year=2013|edition=4 |isbn= 1135120854|page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6vyun52nQtAC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Gevacolor#v=onepage&amp;q=Gevacolor&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Gevacolor featured film was a Malaysian film named ''Buloh Perindu'' (year 1953). This was the first colour film in Southeast Asia. Nine notable films to use this coloring system were in [[India]] - the [[Tamil film]]s ''[[Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum (1956 film)|Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum]]'', ''[[Nadodi Mannan]]'' (1958, half color), ''[[Veerapandiya Kattabomman (film)|Veerapandiya Kattabomman]]'' (some parts in geva color), ''[[Sri Valli (1961 film)|Sri Valli]]'', ''Maaya Mohini'', and the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film [[Lava Kusha]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cinegoer.com/lavakusa.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Hindi]] films, ''[[Hatim Tai (1956 film)]]'' and ''Jimbo'', were shot in Gevacolor.

'''Go equipment''' consists of the objects that are necessary in order to play the game of '''[[Go (game)|Go]]''' which originated in China. Although the equipment is simple, there is a varying degree of quality and material used in making the equipment, from the economical to the extremely valuable.

==History==
The oldest known surviving Go equipment is a board carved from rock that dates from the [[Han Dynasty]] in [[China]]. Other examples of ancient equipment can be found in museums in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]].

==Equipment==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Go handicaps]] --&gt;

===Board===
[[Image:Blank Go board.svg|thumb|An empty go board, with the 19x19 intersecting lines]]

The Go board, called the ''goban'' {{nihongo2|碁盤}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], is the playing surface on which to place the stones. The standard board is marked with a 19×19 grid.  Smaller boards include a 13×13 grid and a 9×9 grid used for shorter games that are often used to teach beginners. Some 19×19 boards have a 13×13 grid on the reverse side. 17×17 was used in historical times. Chinese boards are generally square; Japanese and Korean boards are slightly longer than wide, so that they [[foreshortening|appear square]] when viewed from a normal playing position. In Asian go parlors, the tables are slightly lower than the typical game table so that the players can clearly see the positions of the stones.

Traditional Japanese ''goban'' usually follow the dimensions:
{| class="wikitable"
! !! mm !! inch !! [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese units]]
|-
| Board width                || 424.2 || {{frac|16|23|32}} || 1.4 ''[[Shaku (unit)|shaku]]'' {{nihongo2|尺}}

(1&amp;nbsp;inch = 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm; 1 shaku = 100 bu = 303&amp;nbsp;mm)

Go boards fall into several types or styles.
*Economical boards comprise paper, plastic, or laminate, which can easily be folded away and stored. They are often used by beginners or for when one does not have a proper set available. A board can be hand-drawn on a stiff piece of cardboard for the super-economical.
*Boards that comprise fabric, paper, or plastic may be rolled into a tube and easily carried along with stones to make a portable set. Some materials hold strongly onto the warp though and need to be weighted at the corners to make the board usable when unrolled.
*Magnetic sets are also available, which comprise metal boards and stones that include magnets. They are useful for traveling.  Large magnetic boards are also available for demonstration purposes, during lectures and other presentations.
*Wooden boards, one to two inches thick, are commonly used. They are known as "table boards" because they are placed on tables (compare "floor board" below.) The wood grain is pleasing to the eye, and the stones make a nice sound when placed firmly on the board. Portable boards can be made with hinges or slots.  Some have grids on the reverse.  Boards have been made from almost every type of wood, which includes [[particle board]] with or without [[Wood veneer|veneer]].  Wood, such as [[spruce]] or [[Cercidiphyllum|katsura]] {{nihongo2|桂}}, that has a light color with a fine grain that does not compete with the grid lines is considered most suitable.   The most valued boards are made from [[Torreya nucifera|kaya]], which is a mellow yellow. Also available are [[bamboo]] boards. The tensile strength of bamboo is comparable to that of steel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovermagazine.com/1996/jun/thebamboosolutio784 The Bamboo Solution], ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]''&lt;/ref&gt; making it very durable but also heavier than other wooden boards of the same size.
*A wooden floor board with legs is the most traditional, elegant, and expensive of all boards. Historically, to play on these boards, the Japanese would sit on [[tatami]] mats.  The legs are carved to resemble [[gardenias]].  These boards are still used for important tournament games in Asia. Chinese versions of floor boards are not always made from blocks of wood, and more closely resemble a small table with an inlaid go board. The legs raise the board to the correct height. The board can range from 14–21&amp;nbsp;cm high. The thickest boards are the most elegant. The undersides often have a square recesses (''heso'') to prevent warping and to amplify the sounds of the stones hitting the surface. The best boards are made from Miyazaki kaya, which is rare. These are classified according to the quality of the wood grain. ''Itame'' refers to a bent or irregular grain; ''masame'' refers to consistent grain that runs straight across the top of the board. ''Masame'' boards are further classified as ''tenmasa'' (the top grain is straight, but grain along the cut end is curved, as in the illustration), and most-prized ''tenchimasa'' (grain is straight along the cut end as well as on top.)  Prices of kaya boards range from US$1,000 to $20,000 plus. Boards made of other woods, such as [[Picea sitchensis|Alaskan spruce]], [[Agathis]], or katsura are cheaper, around $500 to $2,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

====Taking care of boards====
{{Manual|date=August 2011}}
Maintaining wooden boards requires that they be properly stored in a humidity and temperature controlled environment to prevent discoloration, warping, cracking, [[woodworm]], [[mold]] and other serious wear.  Prolonged exposure to sunlight can bleach the board. Boards transported between climates with significantly differing humidity levels may be subjected to warping or cracking due to rapidly changing moisture content in the wood.

===Stones===
[[File:Stones go.jpg|thumb|Glass Go stones]]
Go stones, or ''go-ishi'' {{nihongo2|碁石,棋子}}, are round objects placed on the board.  They are colored either black or white, for each player, and normally number 181 for black and 180 for white (or sometimes 180 for each).

There are two styles or shapes of stones depending on where a player obtains them from:
*The Japanese and Korean style, which is lens shaped (i.e. biconvex). This is the most popular style.
*The Chinese style, called ''[[yunzi]]'' {{lang|zh|雲子,云子}}, or 'cloud' also abbreviation for "[[Yunnan]] pebble", because they are normally flat underneath and convex on top. This style is less common outside of China. Flat bottom stones can be useful for post-game analysis; by placing stones upside down, players can easily keep track of which stones were part of the original game. However, they are harder to pick up when clearing them from the board. Yunzi is also available in double convex shape.

The material varies. Some stones are made out of [[plastic]], [[glass]], [[porcelain]] or [[marble]], but the traditional Japanese and Korean stones are made out of [[slate]] for black and [[clam]]shell for white. Chinese style stones can be made of glass, but to be considered true [[yunzi]] they must be [[Sintering|sintered]]. The exact method of creation is a well-kept secret and was in fact lost for a time in the early 20th century due to instability within the country.

====Stone dimensions====

Stone thickness can also vary, from as low as 4 millimeters or as high as 12.8 millimeters, with most between 7.0&amp;nbsp;mm and 10.1&amp;nbsp;mm for biconvex and 5–7&amp;nbsp;mm for single convex. Thick slate and shell stones can last for generations, slowly becoming thinner from handling, and gradually acquiring an ivory-like patina. The diameter of the stones is standardized to around 22&amp;nbsp;mm ±1&amp;nbsp;mm, which can fit almost all Go boards. Black stones are slightly larger in diameter to compensate for optical illusion of the white stones appearing larger when placed with black stones of the same diameter. This mostly applies to Korean and Japanese stones – Chinese stones tend to be sometimes larger in diameter, but they do come in different standard sizes. A Chinese "large" size is about 23&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter while "medium" is about 22&amp;nbsp;mm. Chinese board dimensions are also accordingly larger to accommodate them. See also some comparative measurements of various go stone sets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godiscussions.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3353 Comparative measurements of go stones]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the most expensive clamshell and slate Go stones, stone thickness is carefully controlled and ranked according to size. Typical stone sizes are size 25 (7.0&amp;nbsp;mm thick) to size 37 (10.4&amp;nbsp;mm), and even thicker stones are available for a correspondingly much higher price. Commonly used shell and slate Go stone thicknesses are size 32 (8.8&amp;nbsp;mm) and size 33 (9.2&amp;nbsp;mm) for most individuals and size 36 (10.1&amp;nbsp;mm) for professionals. Stones thicker than 10.1&amp;nbsp;mm are difficult to place on the board, while many Go players prefer stones that are 8.8 and 9.2&amp;nbsp;mm thick, considering these the optimum thickness for aesthetic and practical reasons.

====Plastic stones====
Generally, these are the cheapest stones available. They range from flat, counter shaped to the typical lens shape. Price ranges from around $5–$30.

One specific type of plastic stone is called the Ing stone, manufactured by the Ing Chang-ki Wei-chi Education Foundation. These are the official stones of the Ing Foundation and have some extra weight to them due to metal inserted in the middle of the stone. They are 10&amp;nbsp;mm thick and sometimes come in an Ing Bowl, which is specially designed to count them (Ing rules require each player to start with exactly 180 stones).

Stones can also be made from Melamine resin. This is a stable compound used in making countertops and other kitchenware and is considered safe.

====Porcelain stones====
Porcelain stones are the least common material for stones.

====Glass stones====
The most widely used and most economical. They range from thinner flat-bottomed style, to a symmetrical lens shape. Glass stones have the correct weight and can be grasped with ease. White stones are polished and black ones are buffed to a matte finish, giving a feel somewhat like slate and clam stones. Price ranges from US$15 to $80 for glass stones with bowls. Glass 'gems' at an arts and crafts store are an inexpensive alternative.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==== Slate and clamshell stones ====
These are usually the most expensive stones one can get, since each stone is handmade using mechanical grinding and polishing equipment. The black stones are made of [[slate]], while the white stones are made from [[Bivalve shell|clamshell]]s. Due to a single clam shell yielding only a limited number of stones (around three), white stones are expensive to produce. The clamshells used to make the white stones used to be farmed from Japan, but since the supply is dwindling, most clamshells are harvested from [[Baja California]] in Mexico. These stones have three grades, depending on the stripe or grain pattern of the white stones. All grades use the same uniform black slate stones. Shell stones may also rarely be made out of the [[giant clam]] (shako in Japanese) shell, as well as a clam shell that has a slight purple tint. Clamshell stones are cut as cylinders using a diamond coring drill, then professionally ground, sanded, shaped, and polished into the final product. Shell and slate stones are natural products that provide the ultimate in Go stone aesthetics, and even the lowest grade are far more expensive than the common plastic, glass, and ceramic stones. The price for a set of shell and slate stones ranges from US$200 to over $5,000 according to grade, thicker stones by large costing progressively more within each grade, especially within the Yuki grade.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
*Jitsuyo (practical, standard, or utility-grade) are stones with a coarse grain across the stone, with 7 or 8 wide stripes. The stones are cut near the joint of the shell.
*Tsuki (moon-grade) are stones with a finer grain pattern, with more and thinner stripes covering about 70% of the stone. They are cut around the middle of the shell. These are considered the 'in-between' quality.
*Yuki (snow-grade) are stones with a uniform, fine, straight grain across the stone, with many fine stripes covering at least 80% of the stone. They are cut from near the edge of the shell. These are considered the best by Japanese tastes, and are the most expensive, considering it is difficult to cut a stone with a great deal of thickness since the edge of the shell is mostly thin. The price ranges from $200 to over $35,000, the thicker stones costing more.

====Yunzi stones====
{{Main|Yunzi}}
Yunzi is a style of stone first produced in the Tang Dynasty in China by sintering a trade-secret mixture of mineral compounds including agate (resulting in the slightly yellow-green hue of traditional yunzi stones). The term "yunzi" traditionally applies to stones made of this material, but can refer to any single-convex stone of average Chinese dimensions (slightly larger than a Japanese stone). The process of making Yunzi was lost in the 1920s when the Chinese Civil War spread to Yunnan province, but in the late 1960s it was rediscovered by the now state-managed Yunzi Company. The Yunzi company claims their stones have an advantage of a pleasant sound when placed on the board. Yunzi are delicately made with a jade-like luster yet are neither brittle nor slippery. The black and white pieces each have their special qualities. The white pieces are opaque with a tint of yellow or green. The black pieces are dark, and when held to the light a translucent green hue. With new technology, Yunzi stones can now be made pure white without any discolorations.

====Stone etiquette====
When not making a move, one should leave one's stones in the bowl. During the opponent's turn, it is considered rude for players to rattle stones in the bowl.  It is also considered improper to hold a handful of stones. The "correct" procedure is to decide upon one's move, then remove one stone from the bowl and place it on the board. This produces the minimal amount of distraction for one's opponent.

When removing a stone from its bowl to make a move, place a flat hand on the edge of the bowl, with the fingers gently entering the bowl. Pick up a stone [[Chopsticks|chopstick]]-style with the index and middle fingers, holding the stone between the index fingernail and the middle fingertip.  The fingers extend almost straight, and the thumb is not tucked in.

When placing the stone, take care that long [[sleeve]]s are brushed up to avoid knocking stones already played. To place the stone on the board, as soon as the fingertip of index finger is about to reach the surface of the board, it slips to the side, allowing the middle finger to aim the stone down towards the surface and connect (the other fingers and thumb naturally spread outwards). With a little practice a stone can be placed gracefully and forcefully and with a big click. The keys to a loud click are the force of the middle finger and the late release of the stone. Once the stone has been placed, the middle finger and hand slowly lifts off the stone (trying to avoid wobbling the stone) and gently retreats back to the player.&lt;ref&gt;[http://senseis.xmp.net/?HowToHoldAndPlayAGoStone How to hold and play a go stone]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is permissible to place one's stone at times with a loud, satisfying "thwack", one who does so with every move would be considered crude or vulgar. For instance, when submitting to an opponent's threat, a quiet placement is more in keeping with circumstances; probing moves or clever responses may be slid slyly into place. The ability to express oneself in the manner of making a move explains why one of the names for the game is "hand talk" ("''shudan''" in Japanese, "''shoutan''" in Chinese).

====Taking care of stones====
{{Manual|date=August 2011}}
New stones (of any variety except slate and clamshell) should be washed in warm (soapy) water to remove any oils or chalk by-products of their manufacture or storage protection, then dried thoroughly. Do not use soap when cleaning clamshell stones; new clamshell stones should not need cleaning. New slate stones should be cleaned of excess mineral oil with a cotton cloth. When using stones, one should not slap the stones down too hard. When finished, they should be either kept in their bowls or original packaging and stored away from sunlight and heat. Placing a soft cloth in the bottom of the bowl can help to minimize chipping of stones.

===Bowls===
[[File:Meijin Sen 1.jpg|thumb|Wooden Go bowls on a Japanese-style floor board]]
Go bowls, or ''go-ke'' are the containers for the stones. Although not strictly needed to play Go, bowls nevertheless play an important role in storing the stones, and captured stones can be placed on the lids. Bowls are identical, with one holding the white stones and one holding the black stones.

A bowl's lid is usually rather loose and not tightly fit.  A player traditionally places the lid upside down next to the open bowl and keeps stones there that they have captured from the opponent. The lid is placed so it's easily visible by the opponent, so each player knows how many prisoners the opponent has that are physically removed from the playing board.

The Go bowl can be made of several different materials.
*[[Plastic]]: Very cheap, they can be cylinder shaped or square shaped. The price is around US$5. Quart size plastic food storage containers can also be used.
*[[Straw]]: Mostly used by the Chinese. They are made of woven straw. The price is around US$10–25.
*[[Wood]]: The most common material used to make bowls. The type of [[wood]] used affects the price considerably. [[Morus (plant)|Mulberry]] is one of the most striking and expensive. Intermediate woods are [[quince]] (karin in Japanese), [[Torreya nucifera|kaya]], [[cherry]], [[Zelkova serrata|keyaki]], and [[rosewood]]. Cheaper ones are made out of [[beech]] or [[chestnut]]. [[Bamboo]] also makes for a nice, low-cost bowl. The bowl can be polished. The best bowls are carved from a single piece of wood and have their grains highlighted. The price range varies from $50 to thousands of dollars.

Not all bowls can fit a full set of stones. Most can only hold stones with a thickness of up to 10&amp;nbsp;mm. Larger and more expensive bowls hold stones of thickness of up to 12&amp;nbsp;mm since one would buy thicker and more expensive stones to match the quality of the bowl.

The bowls of highest quality and price are traditionally used only for the best shell and slate stones, of Yuki (snow-grade) quality. Lesser quality wood bowls likewise are used for Jitsuyo (standard-grade) and Tsuki (moon-grade) shell and slate stones, and glass stones are traditionally stored in the least expensive wood bowls or in plastic bowls. A list of woods used in Japanese Go bowls with photographs is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybercomputing.com/go/go-bowls/index.htm Woods Used in Japanese Go Bowls]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greek wrestling''' ({{lang-grc-gre|πάλη}}, ''pálē''), also known as '''Ancient Greek wrestling''' and '''Palé''', was the most popular organized sport in [[Ancient Greece]]. A point was scored when one player touched the ground with his back, hip or shoulder, or conceding defeat due to a submission-hold or was forced out of the wrestling-area. Three points had to be scored to win the match.

One particularly important position in this form of wrestling was one where one of the contestants was lying on his abdomen with the other on his back trying to strangle him. The athlete on the bottom would try to grasp an arm of the one on top and turn him over onto his back while the athlete on top would try to complete the choke without being rolled.

Wrestling was the first competition to be added to the Olympic Games that was not a footrace. It was added in 708 B.C. (Miller, 46). The competitions were held in elimination-tournament style until one wrestler was crowned the victor. The wrestling area was one [[square plethron]] or [[stremma]]. This event was also part of the pentathlon. Wrestling was regarded as the best expression of strength out of all of the competitions and was represented in Greek [[mythology]] by [[Heracles]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Famous wrestlers from antiquity==

[[Milo of Croton]] was one of the most famous wrestlers from this ancient time period. At one set of games, no one challenged him, but as he walked to the ''skamma'' he slipped and fell and was harassed by the crowd as they claimed he shouldn't be crowned because he fell. He contested that he should be crowned because he had only fallen once, two short of the required at least three times (Martin, 50). Leontiskos of Messene was also a noted champion. He was not known for his good wrestling skills, but for his superior finger bending skills. He was able to bend right up to the point of disqualification and won two championships with this technique (Martin, 50).

''I'' was released on 14 January 2015; Critics praised Vikram's performance, the technical aspects of the film - especially the costume design and makeup, and A.R.

==Plot==
Lingesan ([[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]]) is a [[bodybuilder]] from [[Chennai]], whose main ambition is to become [[Mr India World|Mr. India]]. He wins the title of Mr. [[Tamil Nadu]], which gives him direct entry to the Mr. India pageant. He is [[infatuation|infatuated]] with Diya ([[Amy Jackson]]), a leading supermodel. Diya is soon blacklisted, with all her advertisement film contracts cancelled by John ([[Upen Patel]]), her co-star in all her advertisements, after she constantly rejected his sexual advances. To save her career, Diya decides to replace John with Lingesan, whom she had earlier met at one of her shoots, as her co-star for her next advertisement. The shooting is to take place in China at the same time when the Mr. India paegant is to take place, but Lingesan agrees, sacrificing his Mr. India ambitions in the process.

Lingesan is given a makeover by Diya's stylist, a [[transgender]] woman Osma Jasmine (Ojas Rajani). The shoot initially does not go well as Lingesan is shy and awkward around Diya. On her director's advice, Diya pretends to fall in love with Lingesan so that he would loosen up and perform better during the shoot. The plan proves successful but Diya soon tells Lingesan the truth. Hurt, he focouses on modelling instead of her. They both gradually excel in the modelling industry as the lead pair. As time passes, Diya reciprocates Lingesan's love for her and they soon get engaged.

In his journey from a bodybuilder to a top model, Lingesan makes many enemies, including John, whose modelling career was ruined due to Lingesan's rising popularity, forcing him to appear in local advertisements to stay afloat; Osma, who was [[infatuation|infatuated]] with Lingesan and revealed her feelings to him, only to be rejected; industrialist Indrakumar ([[Ramkumar Ganesan]]), whose company suffered losses when Lingesan refused to endorse their soft drink as it was reported to contain pesticides; and another bodybuilder Ravi (M. Kamaraj), who also competed for the Mr. Tamil Nadu title but lost to Lingesan. These four people conspire to take revenge on Lingesan and destroy his fame and modelling career.

Two days before his wedding, Lingesan slowly starts to experience hair and teeth loss and a skin disorder. He consults his friend Vasudevan ([[Suresh Gopi]]), a doctor who is also the guardian of Diya's family. Vasudevan claims that he is suffering from a rare and incurable genetic disease which results in premature ageing. Lingesan's condition worsens, with his face and body [[Deformity|deforming]], and eventually he becomes a [[kyphosis|hunchback]]. In his current condition, Lingesan decides to disappear from public eye and also from Diya's life by [[Faked death|faking his death]] in a car accident. Only his friend Babu ([[N. Santhanam|Santhanam]]) and Vasudevan know that he is alive. Lingesan asks Vasudevan to marry Diya as he is the only person who will be able to understand Diya's past and present situation. Vasudevan agrees and the wedding is fixed.

On the eve of Diya's wedding, another doctor named Thiruvengadam reveals to Lingesan that, contrary to Vasudevan's claims, he is actually suffering from H4N2 influenza, caused by the "[[Orthomyxoviridae|I]]" virus, which can only be transmitted by injection. He discovers that John, Osma, Indrakumar, Ravi and, to his horror, even Vasudevan, are responsible for injecting the virus into his body. Vasudevan had an [[Pedophilia|insatiable lust]] for Diya since she was ten years old and was enraged when she chose Lingesan over him. Therefore, he sided with Lingesan's enemies and planned the entire operation to have Lingesan injected with the virus. Enraged and betrayed, Lingesan abducts Diya on her wedding day and keeps her safely in an old house without revealing his identity to her.

Aided by Babu, Lingesan starts taking revenge on those who had deformed him. He first immolates Ravi, who suffers severe [[burn]]s. He then prepares a paste which Osma unknowingly applies on her body, causing her body to [[Hypertrichosis|sprout huge growths of hair]]. Next, he subjects Indrakumar to [[bee sting]]s all over his body. He fights John over a moving train and gets him [[electrocution|electrocuted]]. Finally, he gets Vasudevan to unwittingly inject a virus into himself, causing his whole body to [[Elephantiasis|swell up]]. After achieving his revenge, Lingesan reveals his condition to Diya, who, though initially taken aback, still loves him despite his deformity. They decide to live a secluded life together. Lingesan undergoes [[Ayurveda|ayurvedic]] treatment, yoga and physiotherapy for his condition and soon returns to normal.

===Origin===
In an interview with the Tamil channel [[Sun TV (India)|Sun TV]], held shortly after the release of ''[[Enthiran]]'' in October 2010, the film's lead actor [[Rajinikanth]] revealed that [[S. Shankar|Shankar]], in 1996, following the release of his ''[[Indian (1996 film)|Indian]]'', had approached and pitched three storylines for him to consider for his next venture. Rajinikanth was impressed with two of the scripts and agreed to star in the films, which became ''[[Sivaji (film)|Sivaji]]'' (2007) and ''[[Enthiran]]'' (2010). The third script narrated by Shankar was centered on an aspiring bodybuilder who would later turn into a deformed hunchback following a freak accident. Rajinikanth was sceptical of it and refused it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Rajinikanth (Actor) |date=October 2010 |title=Super Star Rajini&amp;nbsp;– Special Interview |medium=Interview |language=Tamil |location=Chennai |publisher=Sun TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The claim was also backed by composer [[A.

A [[Pink Floyd pigs|giant inflatable pig]] has been one of the staple [[Theatrical property|props]] of [[Pink Floyd live performances]] since 1977 when the album [[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|''Animals'']] was released. After [[Roger Waters]] departed [[Pink Floyd]] in 1985, he continued to use the pig as a show element during his solo live performances.

==''The Dark Side of the Moon Live'' tour 2006–2007==
Roger Waters used inflatable pigs at many shows on his 2006–2007 tour ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon Live]]'', specifically, when he performed the song "[[Sheep (song)|Sheep]]", concluding the first part of the show. The pigs used on tour were decorated with [[slogans]] and pieces of song lyrics, and with various drawings. During select performances at open-air venues the pig was released to "fly" away, a reference to the idiom "Pigs might fly".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordadvancedlearnersdictionary.com/dictionary/pig_1 pig – Definition and pronunciation | Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HollywoodBowlPig.JPG|right|thumb|A pig entering Hollywood Bowl before being walked through and then released into the Los Angeles sky during Waters' show of 5 October.]]
*5 October 2006, at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in Hollywood: [[slogans]] decorating the pig included "[[Kafka]] Rules OK!" on the pig's side, "[[Impeach]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Now", on the pig's backside, and "[[I Have a Dream|Free at Last]]", written on the pig's underbelly. Handlers released the pig into the night sky. Afterwards, authorities informed Waters that he would face charges if it was attempted again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The pig was released again at the Shoreline Amphitheatre show in Mountain View the following week, on 10 October.

===2007 Australia, New Zealand and Asian tour dates===
*9 February 2007, at [[Perth Oval]] in [[Perth]], Australia: the pig was again walked through the audience, then released, apparently deliberately. It was decorated with many slogans, including "Bring [[David Hicks]] home." It was followed by [[Searchlight|spotlight]] as it rose through the night sky and eventually landed in a swimming pool about {{convert|15|km|miles}} away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===2007 Latin American tour dates===
* In [[Mexico City]], the pig had the message "Cerdo Bush derriba el muro de la frontera" ("PIG BUSH, DEMOLISH THE BORDER WALL"). The pig was released into the sky and was found in the nearby area of Azcapotzalco two days later.
* In [[Bogotá, Colombia]], the pig featured the following slogans: "El patrón Bush visita el rancho de Colombia" (The landlord Bush visits the Colombian ranch)&lt;ref name="concierto"&gt;http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-3469125 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="visita"&gt;http://www.elblablabla.com/article/l5207 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; a clear reference to Bush's visit to the country only two days later,&lt;ref name="visita"/&gt; "Libres al fin"&lt;ref name="concierto"/&gt; (Free at last) on the pig's belly, "El miedo construye paredes" (Fear Builds Walls), and "[[Franz Kafka|Kafka]] manda" (Kafka rules) on one leg, while also having peace symbols, the word "amor" (love) on his right hind foot, and the words "lechona Bush" (roasted pig Bush) on the pig's buttocks, as well as its sides reading "Devuélvanle la tierra a la gente" (Give the people back their land), and "Legalizen las drogas" (Legalize drugs),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/31515558@N00/417868256/ Visita | Flickr – Photo Sharing!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/drayru/417868253/in/photostream/ Fear | Flickr – Photo Sharing!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/drayru/420193757/in/photostream/ ¡Libre por Fin! | Flickr – Photo Sharing!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; referencing the problem of refugees, the traffic of illegal substances and poor distribution of land in Colombia. The pig vanished into the night during the bridge of "Sheep".
* In [[Lima]], the message for Peruvians was "Todos los peruanos somos iguales, no a la discriminación" (All peruvians are equal, no discrimination), due to one of the main problems in Peruvian society, discrimination against andean people, afroperuvians, gays and lesbians and others. Other messages included: "Stop Bush" and "Kafka rules".&lt;ref name="Video"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwkIYSgvLA&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Santiago]], Chile, the pig had the following messages: "Socialismo al servicio de las S.A."(''Socialism in service of the corporations''), "Libre al fin" ("[[I Have a Dream|Free at Last]]"), "Sin TAG" (''Without TAG''), "Va a nevar en el espacio, la [[NASA]] no lo sabe" (''It's going to snow in space, NASA doesn't know''), "Sorpresas de la democracia, la basura sale a flote" (''Surprises of democracy, trash rises to the top''), "Push [[George W. Bush|Bush]] contra la muralla" (''Push Bush up against the wall'', perhaps a reference to the lyrics of [[In the Flesh (Pink Floyd song)|In the Flesh]]), "¿Fey? ¿Iñ chiñ? ¿El? ¿Nosotros? Tristes metáforas" (''He? We all?'' in [[Mapudungun]], then ''He? We all? Sad metaphors'' in Spanish), "[[Víctor Jara]] no calla" (''Víctor Jara won't be silenced''), and "[[mass-energy equivalence|E=MCool]]". Some of the messages were authored by Chilean poets [[Nicanor Parra]], [[Elicura Chihuailaf]], and [[Diego Maquieira]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The pig was released at the end of "Sheep".
* In [[Buenos Aires]] the pig had different messages, like "¿Donde esta Julio Lopez?" (Where's Julio Lopez, a missing witness in a [[political trial]]), "El miedo crea paredes" (Fear creates walls), "Bush go home", "Corte Aqui" (cut here) next to a dotted line around the neck and "[[Kafka]] rules OK", among others.
* In [[São Paulo]], the pig bore messages such as "All we need is education", "Bush, não estamos à venda!" (Portuguese for "[[George W. Bush|Bush]], we're not for sale!"), "Killers, leave our kids alone" (a reference to [[João Hélio Fernandes Vieites]], a young boy who had been recently murdered in a [[Motor vehicle theft]]) and "Ordem e Progresso?", a pun with the inscription of the Brazilian flag which reads "Order and Progresso" (Order and Progress) without the [[question mark]].

===2007 European tour dates===
*3 May 2007, [[Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy]], Paris, France "What an asshole", "[[Le Pen (surname)|Le Pen]]" "Enculés", "All religions divide us".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brain-damage.co.uk/2007-tour-zone/may-3rd-palais-omnisports-de-bercy-paris-france.html Review and verifiable photo].&lt;/ref&gt;
*12 May 2007, at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]], London; in addition to much of the above, ('Stop Bush…', 'Nearly a laugh…', '[[Dick Cheney]]… asshole!'), the mention of [[Tony Blair]] had an arrow from the underside where ''good riddance'' had been added—Blair had announced the timetable for his resignation the day before the [[Gig (musical performance)|gig]]. Additionally, 'All Religions Build Walls' on one side.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB2YvbBqJnY YouTube – Pig flying around to Pink Floyd's Sheep LIVE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 North American tour dates===
[[Image:Inflatable pig at the Roger Waters Tour.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A close-up of the pig released at the Roger Waters show on 1 June 2007.]]
*19 May 2007, In [[Tampa]], Florida: The pig was painted by James Vendetta and released at the [[Ford Amphitheatre (Tampa)|Ford Amphitheater]] despite a 40&amp;nbsp;mph wind. One side read "[[Kafka]] Rules" and "[[Habeas Corpus]] Matters". The other side read "I only answer to God – [[Tony Blair]]". Under the words "I only answer to God" was written "Is this democracy?". Under "Tony Blair" was written, "Good Riddance". On the pig's [[Buttocks|butt]], it said, "[[Impeach]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Now". The belly said, "[[Free at last]]". On the throat, "Cut Here" with a dotted line. The pig was paraded through the crowd and released into the sky, but because the pig was not completely inflated it didn't float quickly enough to make it out the venue. The pig finally got tangled up on one of the columns supporting the venue's massive roof and blocked a giant [[LED]] screen for the rest of the show. Roger then said "In the meanwhile, we're gonna try and free that pig!" after the first set.
*30 May 2007, New York City: On the pig's right side: "[[Habeas Corpus]] Matters" and "Fear Builds Walls". On the left side: "[[Torture]] Shames Us All!" and "Religions Divide". On the rear: "Impeach Bush" with a [[peace sign]] over the pig's [[Buttocks|ass]]. Along the neck: "Cut Here" above a dotted line with a spattering of blood. Unlike the two previous pigs, this one had a partial drawing of [[The Wall]] on both sides.

*13 June 2007, at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in Hollywood: a pig was walked around, but not released. "Torture shames us all" and "All religions divide" on the right side ("No education" in smaller writing). "Habeus {{sic}} corpus matters", "Fear builds walls" on the left side. "Free at last" on the belly. "Impeach Bush" on the rear. Various [[graffiti]]-style writings all around.
*2 July 2007, at the [[Marcus Amphitheater]] in [[Milwaukee]]: a pig was walked around, and released over Lake Michigan. Similar markings to previous events; may have been the same pig as the earlier Hollywood Bowl performance.

==Live Earth==
7 July 2007: Roger Waters played in [[Live Earth concert, New York City|the New York leg of Live Earth]]. When he began singing "[[The Happiest Days of Our Lives]]" / "[[Another Brick in the Wall#Part 2|Another Brick in the Wall Part 2]]" the pig came out again. It had a more [[cartoon]]ish look, and part of its body appeared as that of the wall. It had the words "[[Together we stand, divided we fall]]" (the last lines of "[[Hey You (Pink Floyd song)|Hey You]]") on one side and "[[SOS]]" on the other. Unlike the SOS logo for Live Earth (which stood for "[[Save Our Selves]]"), the one on the pig said "Save Our Sausages" instead.

====Coachella====
 &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Rogerwaterspig.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Special pig for [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] 27 April 2008.]] --&gt;
*27 April 2008 At the conclusion of the three-day music festival, called [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], [[Roger Waters]] ended the night, but not before he could release a special white pig. Over 50,000 people were in attendance. The pig was adorned with political messages. One side read "Don't be led to the [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]", with [[Uncle Sam]] holding two [[cleaver]]s. The other side said "Fear builds walls." The bottom read "[[Barack Obama|Obama]]" with a check besides it, while the butt of the pig read "Impeach Bush" in graffiti lettering. Nearing the end of the first act, during "Sheep", the handlers lost their grip on the pig. Many people in attendance at the concert thought this was planned, but later it was announced that a $10,000 reward with 4 lifetime passes to [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] would be given to whoever found the pig. It was found as "crumpled heaps of shredded, spray-painted plastic" three days later at a nearby [[country club]] in [[La Quinta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mydesert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080429/NEWS01/80429001/1006 Pig found in La Quinta country club]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the pig, a low-flying plane dropped thousands of tiny [[Leaflet (information)|leaflet]]s with the Obama [[Check Mark]] design on the crowd. This caused a problem with the nearby town of [[Indio, California|Indio]], where residents woke up to their town completely littered with trash.

====Denver====
*30 April 2008 The pig appeared during "Sheep" and dropped leaflets with "Obama" with a check box next to his name.

====Dallas====
* On 2 May 2008, Roger Waters' pig appeared during the bridge of the song "Sheep". The pig entered from the left side of the [[SuperPages.com Center]] pavilion and made its way across sections 101 and 102 just in front of the [[Very Important Person|VIP]] boxes.  The pig was then taken out the right-hand side into the lawn-seating area and proceeded to the middle rear of the crowd.  The crowd eventually took control and briefly mobbed the pig before releasing it into the night sky. The pig allegedly travelled to downtown [[Dallas]], where it hit a crane over [[Victory Park, Dallas, Texas|Victory Park]]. The pig for the Dallas show was constructed by artist [[Frank Campagna]]. The dimensions of the pig were 30 × 15 feet.  The front left leg was painted with the words "Fear Builds Walls" over a series of grey bricks.  The left side said "Obama" with a check box next to his name.  Under the Obama "ballot" were the words "Don't Be Led to the Slaughter".  The pig's penis had "Cheney" written on it.  The pig's [[anus]] was adorned with the words "Impeach Bush Now".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufrl3R1E6Sk YouTube – Roger Waters' Pig Flies In Dallas 05.02.08]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs2X6Egg-ak YouTube – Roger Waters' Pig Attacks and Flies Free in Dallas 05.02.08]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJdCquNjpgY YouTube – Pink Floyd – Roger Waters Pig Balloon Attacked]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Houston====
*4 May 2008 The pig appeared and followed much the same path as in Dallas.  The bearers of the pig struggled to keep it controlled while under the roof of the [[Woodlands Pavilion]], due to a combination of [[crosswind]] and [[downdraught]] from overhead fans.  The pig made four complete circles of the lawn-seating section before being released.  One change in the pig's appearance was the absence of the "cut here" line, and the addition of two [[black eyes]] and a number of bruises.  The pig was half pink and had large patches of bricks with graffiti-styled writing on them.  The check mark next to "OBAMA" appears as a dotted edged square. The right side of the pig had the statement "All Religions Divide" written across it.  The left side of the pig showed a [[caricature]] of President [[George W. Bush]] with [[porcine]] features, with the phrase "Only Dimly Aware" next to it—a reference to the song being sung, "Sheep":  ''"Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away / Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air"''.

===2008 European tour dates===

====Landgraaf (The Netherlands)====
*11 May 2008 Waters' pig appeared once again during the song "Sheep". It was pink with texts on both sides. On the bottom "Obama" was written, and "Fear builds walls" on the right side. It was released and floated away into the air.

Forget Israel/Palestine. Waters deployed a classic disgusting medieval anti-Semitic caricature widely used by both Nazi and Soviet propaganda to incite hatred against Jews.".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=8486393&amp;ct=13225101&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 2013, Waters posted an open letter on his Facebook page in response to Cooper's "entirely predictable resulting rant." Addressing Cooper, Waters wrote, "I hold your outburst to be inflammatory and un-helpful and would suggest it can only impede progress towards peace and understanding between people. It is also extremely insulting to me personally in that you accuse me of being 'Anti Semitic', 'A Jew Hater' and 'Nazi Sympathizer'... I have many very close Jewish friends, one of whom, interestingly enough, is the nephew of the late [[Simon Wiesenthal]]. I am proud of that association; Simon Wiesenthal was a great man... I have often come under attack by the pro Israel lobby because of my support for BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) which I won't go into here... However I will say this, in a functioning theocracy it is almost inevitable that the symbol of the religion becomes confused with the symbol of the state, in this case the State of Israel... Like it or not, the Star of David represents Israel and its policies and is legitimately subject to any and all forms of non-violent protest. To peacefully protest against Israel's racist domestic and foreign policies is NOT ANTI-SEMITIC." Waters also wrote, "For the sake of some perspective. The inflatable pig...has appeared at every Wall Show since September 2010, some 193 shows, yours is the first complaint. Also the pig in question represents evil, and more specifically the evil of errant government. We make a gift of this symbol of repression to the audience at the end of every show and the people always do the right thing. They destroy it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/notes/roger-waters-the-wall/an-open-letter-from-roger-waters/688037331210720], ''An Open Letter from Roger Waters'', 1 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desert Trip Show 2016 &amp; ''Us + Them'' tour 2017-2018==
 
Inflatable pigs were special decorations which have been used by [[Roger Waters]] in his concert when the singer took part in [[Desert Trip]] show on Sunday, October, 9 2016. They were decorated by images and phrases. 
===Inflatable pigs at Desert Trip===
	
Spectators of the concert could see pigs floating above [[Empire Polo Field]] where the event took place. Totally the singer used 3 different pigs in his performance which was watched live by over 75 thousand viewers. In order to control oversized animals the remote control was used. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a49622/lucius-roger-waters-desert-trip Behind the Scenes of Roger Waters's Trump-Searing Desert Trip Set]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/roger-waters-the-who-desert-trip Roger Waters and the Who Close Out Desert Trip&lt;/ref&gt;
	
===Anti-Trump statements===

Inflatable pigs appeared when Roger Waters performed his song “[[Pigs (Three Different Ones)]]”. At this time there was a message for spectators on the huge screen behind the artist. It displayed a number of anti-Trump pictures. And the pig became floating up in the air. It was possible to see a phrase “F…k Trump and his wall”. Roger Waters condemned a candidate from Republican party for presidential elections in the USA [[Donald Trump]] for his statements about other nations, his racist and sexist comments. On the other side of inflatable pig it could see the phrase “Arrogant, lying, racist, sexist”. On other pig it was written “Together We Stand / Divided We Fall”. Viewers saw on a screen Trump wore Ku Klux Klan hood and there could be possible to read word Charade. If someone didn’t understand meaning for the first time, it was enough to watch at the screen once again and to see the phrase “Trump is a pig”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/roger-waters-delivers-politically-charged-desert-trip-performance Roger Waters delivers politically charged Desert Trip performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Indic text}}

'''Krishnan Nair''' (25 July 1939 – 16 November 1980), better known by his stage name '''Jayan''', was an Indian film actor, [[Officer (armed forces)|naval officer]], [[stunt performer]] and [[cultural icon]] of the 1970s. He starred in over 120 [[Malayalam film]]s. During his film career, he was primarily an action star and was particularly famous for his [[macho]] image and unique style. He was reputed for his chauvinistic appeal and well known for performing [[stunt]]s of a dangerous nature on his own. By the late 1970s, he became the most popular [[lead actor]] and [[bankable star]] of [[Malayalam cinema]] and has been acclaimed as the first [[action hero]] of Malayalam cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Mathrubhumi weekly, 2010 November 21 issue, Page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Jayan was a [[Master Chief Petty Officer]] in the [[Indian Navy]], before he came to films and rose to fame as an actor in a very short time, appearing as an action hero in numerous films during the 1970s. He died at the age of 41, at the peak of his popularity, as a result of an accident while filming a dangerous [[stunt]] involving a flying helicopter that crashed while he was hanging on to it. He has since then become a legendary symbol of daredevilry and masculinity with numerous inspirations, imitations, his unfading popularity being widely used to promote new-age movies, actors and brands and an ever-growing fan-base spanning generations.

His superhuman image has also transformed him into an iconic figure of popular culture among [[Malayali]]s around the world, with widespread impersonations on stage and television programs based on his screen persona. It was accompanied by a cartoon, email and SMS phenomenon in the early 2000s, portraying him as a comic superhero with [[Jayan quotes|unique quotes]] of superhuman strength attributed to the action star becoming widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekerala.net/r.php?url=http://www.hackorama.com/jayan/quotes.shtml&amp;title=jayan |title=Those unmistakable Jayan dialogues |publisher=ekerala.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekerala.net/r.php?url=http://www.ananthapuri.com/board/topic.asp?topic_id=94&amp;title=jayan |title=Jayan jokes and quotes |publisher=ananthapuri.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These movements were fuelled by a renewed fascination with his style of dialogue delivery and his machismo image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WpvBKWze3U |title=Typical Jayan dialogue |publisher=asianet |date= |accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q9dMEh3bNs |title=Immortal Action Hero Jayan in his typical role. |publisher=Saina |date= |accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were claimed to honour his memories, but were also criticised for parodying the legendary actor years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2006/07/02/stories/2006070202300200.htm |title=Reminiscing about Jayan and his ways |publisher=The Hindu |date=2 July 2006 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW 211111"&gt;Mathrubhumi weekly, 21 November 2010, Page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

===Early life===

Jayan was born in [[Quilon]], [[Travancore]] as the first child of his father Thevalli, Kottaram Veetil Madhavan Pillai and mother Bharathiyamma. His birth name was Krishnan Nair. He had a younger brother named Soman Nair. Malayalam actress [[Jayabharathi]], who was his first cousin introduced him to the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ഓര്മകള് മരിക്കുമോ?|url=http://www.mathrubhumi.com/movies-music/flashback/kamalhasan-remembering-jayan-malayalam-news-1.671132|publisher=mathrubhumi.com|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jayan's formal education ended at the 10th grade at Kollam Govt. Boys High School when he joined the [[Indian Navy]]. The first accolades for his acting skills reached him when he was a naval sailor. He used to act in plays at various functions such as anniversaries. The encouragement from his friends and colleagues in the Navy gave him the desire to act in films. Jayan served in the Indian Navy for 16 years, culminating in the rank of [[Master Chief Petty Officer|Master CPO]]. By the end of his navy days, he had begun efforts to start small businesses at [[Ernakulam]] and became a regular inhabitant of the Cochin Tourist Home. During his life at Ernakulam, he would meet some of his lifelong friends. It was such a chance meeting while on leave, with Rajan Prakash who is the veteran Malayalam actor [[Jose Prakash]]'s son, who owned a dry cleaning shop in Cochin, that eventually landed him a role in the movie ''Shapa Moksham''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan20-1?context=latest |title=Ormapperukkangalil- Jose Prakash memoirs on Jayan |publisher=chithrabhoomi |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he left the Indian Navy and started trying his hand at various civilian jobs, working for companies in Cochin for a few years till his acting career began to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan21-1?context=latest |title=Ormapperukkangalil (2)- Jose Prakash memoirs on Jayan |publisher=chithrabhoomi |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; an.

===Film career===

====Random appearances and early career====
Jayan did make a few random uncredited appearances in some movies of the early 1970s, the first of which was in ''Postmane Kanmanilla''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayannewsclippingmemories.jpg |title=Actor Jayan in memories |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iho4gz1833I |title=Remembering Jayan on his anniversary |publisher=asianet |date= |accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These minor appearances were before he attained the screen name Jayan. According to his nephew, he had the role of a vampire-like character in an unnamed project costarred by [[Vidhubala]], which was never released.&lt;ref&gt;Nostalgia magazine, November 2010 issue, Page 13&lt;/ref&gt; His first appearance with the name ''Jayan'' was in the movie ''Shapa Moksham'', which is usually credited as his first film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan73-1?context=latest |title=Jayan selected filmography- List of known films |publisher=ning.com |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rise to fame====
The name "Jayan" (English: "The Victor") was given to him by veteran Malayalam actor Jose Prakash on the sets of Shapa Moksham. Jayan started his career by acting in minor roles starting with ''Shapa Moksham'' (1974). Jayan got his first major break appearing as a villain in ''Panchami'' (1976), playing the role of a forest ranger. Jayan's performance in this film was appreciated in the industry and his physical appearance was also noticed for the first time. His next notable role was in ''[[Thacholi Ambu]]'' (1978), in which he appeared in a supporting role. In the same year, he acted as a sage in the Sreekumaran Thampi film ''Etho Oru Swapnam'', which was well received by critics. But what made Jayan a superstar was his [[antihero]] role in ''[[Sharapancharam]]'' (1979, ''Bed of Arrows''). He catapulted to fame riding on [[machismo]] roles that endeared him to the masses, and he established himself as one of the most popular Malayalam film actors of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumkeralam.com/malayalam-cinema/5931-jayan-film-festival-kairali-tv.html |title=Jayan The Immortal Superstar |publisher=forumkeralam.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is generally regarded as the first action hero in Malayalam cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/advt/movie/jayan/index.htm |title=Nostalgia- Jayan Memories |publisher=manoramaonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metromatinee.com/artist/Jayan-329 |title=Metromatinee.com- Action Hero Jayan |publisher=metromatinee.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105053530/http://www.metromatinee.com/artist/Jayan-329 |archivedate=5 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Superstardom====
''Sharapancharam'' broke all box-office records set in the Malayalam movie industry till it's time and became the highest grossing movie of 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianterminal.com/forum/first-cut-first-show/53038-highest-grossed-malayalam-movies-from-1980-to-2009-must-see.html |title=List of highest grossing films |publisher=indianterminal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It's box-office records were broken by another Jayan film, ''Angadi'' (Market) in the following year, which cemented his popularity among the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianterminal.com/forum/first-cut-first-show/53038-highest-grossed-malayalam-movies-from-1980-to-2009-must-see.html |title=List of yearwise top grossers in malayalam |publisher=indianterminal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In films such as ''Manushya Mrugam'', ''Aavesham'' etc. he played double roles. During his career, he received only a few critically appreciated roles perhaps partly due to his commercial hero image and partly due to the lack of films that garnered critical appreciation at the time. The focus was always on his unmatched drawing power as an action star and by 1980, at the peak of his career, he had attained a genuine superhero image. Movies exploited Jayan's masculine physique and he appeared bare-chested in numerous scenes. His on-screen attire (most famously his [[Elvis]] [[bellbottoms]]), his masculine image and later the nature of his death transformed him into a [[legend]] in Kerala. Jayan was also known for his unique method of dialogue delivery and he has contributed many memorable lines to the Malayalam film history.

====Multistar films====
Jayan acted in several [[ensemble cast|multistar]] movies, mostly with [[Prem Nazir]]. The duo acted in films such as ''Nayattu, Love in Singapore, Chandrahasam, [[Thacholi Ambu]], [[Kannappanunni]], Palattu Kunjikkannan, Mamangam, Prabhu'' etc. all of which were top grossing movies at the box office. He also acted with other popular actors of the time, such as [[M. G. Soman|Soman]], [[Sukumaran]] and [[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]] in many films. In early films before 1979 (e.g. ''Thacholi Ambu'' and ''Panchami''), he had negative or supporting roles. But later films in the beginning of 1980 relied heavily on Jayan's drawing power as an action hero and placed him as the central character. In 1980, the duo Jayan and Prem Nazir were cast in ''Ariyapedatha Rahasiyam'' by [[P. Venu]], that showcased the famous fight scene in Malayalam cinema. Prem Nazir agreed to play a supporting role in ''Nayattu'', which was very unlikely for a superstar of those times. He had agreed to do this as a token of friendship with Jayan and the director Sreekumaran Thamby. The duo had many actions films together such as ''Irumbazhikal'', ''Love in Singapore'' etc. where the box office draw was huge.

==Death==
[[Image:JayanHelicopterStunt.jpg|right|thumb|This picture was taken seconds before his death]]
On 16 November 1980, Jayan was killed in an accident on the set of the movie ''[[Kolilakkam]]'' (English: ''Shockwave''). The climactic scene of the movie was being filmed in [[Sholavaram]], near [[Madras]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. Jayan always performed his own stunts, and for this movie he was performing a particularly dangerous stunt that involved him boarding an airborne helicopter from a moving motorbike. The shot was accepted by the director in the first take; altogether three shots were filmed.

According to the film's production executive, Jayan insisted on yet another re-take as he was not satisfied with its perfection. During the re-take, the helicopter lost its balance and crashed along with Jayan who was hanging onto the landing skids, and he later succumbed to his injuries.

[[File:JayanLastViewCrowd.jpg|right|thumb|A snap of the huge crowd assembled at [[Quilon]] city to see Jayan on his cremation]]
After his death was confirmed, a slide was added during the theatre show of his movie ''Deepam'', which was running in packed houses, informing his death to the viewers who witnessed it with absolute shock and disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/advt/movie/jayan_special/index.htm |title=Jayan- A Golden Memory |publisher=Manoramaonline |date=16 November 2009 |accessdate=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of his fans burst into tears and ran out of the buildings, while many continued to watch the movie, refusing to believe it and taking it for an ingenious promotion for some upcoming project.&lt;ref name="MW 211111"/&gt;

Jayan's body was taken to [[Trivandrum]] via [[aeroplane]] and later it was taken to his home in [[Quilon]], where he was cremated. Thousands paid homage to the late actor, and the police had to take huge measures to deal with the crowds. His mother Bharathiyamma became bedridden after this incident, and she too died two years later.

Some [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] emerged regarding the circumstances of his death, primarily because the pilot and his co-star [[Balan K. Nair]], who was in the helicopter, survived with minor or no injuries. Nevertheless, it has been confirmed as a genuine accident.

==The Aftermath==
[[File:JayanCitizenWatch.jpg|right|thumb|The Citizen watch that Jayan had used during the shoot of the film ''Kolilakkam'']]
After Jayan's death, several films were released claiming to be his last film, including the genuine one, ''Kolilakkam''. In all these films, Jayan's voice was dubbed by Aleppey Ashraf, a popular mimicry artist of the time. Many projects meant for him were recast, such as ''Thusharam'' by I.V. Sasi, P.G. Vishwambaran's ''Sphodanam,'' and Sasi Kumar's ''Dhruva Sangamam''. Numerous other projects were cancelled entirely. One stunt scene and two songs were already shot with Jayan for C.V. Hariharans ''Garjanam'', but after his death, it was recast with [[Rajinikanth]], becoming his second film in Malayalam released in 1981.

===Imposter Movement===
Due to his unrivalled popularity that continued many years after his death, random bit scenes were added to numerous films that showed random gestures or shots of him walking by the side during fight scenes. Attempts were made to bring in impostors who tried to imitate his style and mannerisms, enabling several artists from the field of mimicry to show up on the big screen. But these experiments failed miserably, and proved especially ineffective in fight and stunt scenes. Then, directors and producers started a search for new actors to replace him. This movement led to debuts of actors who resembled Jayan in physical appearance (e.g. [[Ratheesh]]), those with stage names sounding similar to his (for example, his own brother who appeared as Ajayan), and those with similar mannerisms and style (e.g. [[Bheeman Raghu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mathrubhumi weekly, 21 November 2010, Page 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/12/24/stories/2002122405970400.htm |title=Actor Ratheesh dead |publisher=The Hindu |date=24 December 2002 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of them, [[Mammootty]], who started with the stage name [[Sajin]], would later go on to become one of the popular future stars in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://actorjayan.ning.com/photo/jayan87-1?context=latest |title=Chamayangalode (4)- Sajin and Jayan's throne |publisher=ning.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, all these attempts to replace Jayan with a new star with a similar image yielded disappointing results. It is now one of the most popular quotes in Malayalam cinema "Jayan's throne remains vacant and will forever be so".

===Resurgence in the 2000s===
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, there was a resurgence of Jayan's screen persona in [[Kerala]] and his old movie scenes came to prominence again.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Because I have a voice|author=Arvind Narrain &amp; Gautam Bhan|publisher=Yoda Press|year=2005|isbn=81-902272-2-X|pages=75, 85, 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was owed mostly to programs by popular [[mimicry]] stage artists in the State, whose imitations of the star's mannerisms caught on and soon became commonplace in college stage events, television programs and mimicry stage shows along with quotes of superhuman strength known as [[Jayan quotes]]. However, it has been pointed out that many grotesquely imitated screen dialogues of Jayan are not actually his, but that of dubbing artist Aleppey Ashraf, who dubbed for many of his characters after his death.

The "comeback" of Jayan and his renewed popularity lately may be taken as an affirmation that Jayan has not been replaced even nearly three decades after his death. Today, Jayan is best remembered as the first and best action star of Malayalam cinema, so far, besides his trademark colourful attire, risky stunts, machismo mannerisms and unique speaking style. He has rightly won immortality in the hearts of the Malayalam film fans as a martyr in his yearning to thrill and entertain them even by putting his life at stake. [[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]], a famous actor prominent in the 1960s, once stated in an interview: "Jayan will forever be young and alive. No one can ever visualise him as an old man."

A film titled ''Avatharam'' presently under production, is attempting to bring back his screen persona using advanced technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hindu.com/2011/01/18/stories/2011011851360200.htm |title=The Hindu Report-Action star Jayan to reappear in movie |publisher=hindu.com |date= 18 January 2011|accessdate=2011-01-19 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flashnewstoday.com/index.php/late-jayan-returns-to-silver-screen/ |title=Jayans returns to silver screen |publisher=flashnewstoday.com |date=24 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary on Jayan's life and death ''Jayan – The Man behind the Legend'' is nearing completion for release in the near future.

==Legacy==
Jayan is perhaps the only actor thus far in the history of Malayalam film industry who remains a marketable superstar decades after his demise, to this day. In the state of Kerala, he is a true icon of popular culture, whose life and image has made him a legend over time.

Murali Jayan has claimed to be actor Jayan's son and has been legally asking for a DNA test.
===Superhero image and commercial success===
Through his machismo roles and staggering stunt feats, Jayan had attained a real life Superhero image amongst the fans, masses and colleagues alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayannewsclippingmemories.jpg |title=Ormakalile Jayan |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His colourful attire and unique bass voice also helped him capture the imagination of the average viewer as the manly action hero. Along with these, his trademark styles and mannerisms made him a campus hero and youth idol of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayanarticlebydirector.jpg |title=Jayan- The actor who gave fascination |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summing up, Jayan's image among the masses was that of a daring superhuman who would perform seemingly impossible deeds and accomplish extraordinary feats.

Jayan is the most commercially successful superstar till date in the Malayalam industry with a near 90% success rate. The years 1979, 1980 and 1981 became known as "Jayan years" in the industry due to the widespread release and success of his movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/jnote0052.jpg |title=Ethiralikal illatha supertharam |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His films ''Sharapancharam'' and ''Angadi'', released in 1979 and 1980 respectively, were record breakers and became the highest grossers of their respective years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianterminal.com/forum/first-cut-first-show/53038-highest-grossed-malayalam-movies-from-1980-to-2009-must-see.html |title=Highest grossing malayalam films |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final film, ''Kolilakkam'' was the highest grosser in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianterminal.com/forum/first-cut-first-show/53038-highest-grossed-malayalam-movies-from-1980-to-2009-must-see.html |title=List of top grossing malayalam films yearwise list |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The noteworthy point is that a large percentage of films released during his peak years lacked a strong plot and were mostly cheap low budget remakes of successful movies from other language sectors of Indian cinema. Many of these films came out astoundingly successful due to his sheer presence and some avoided failures due to his small cameo appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/JayanFilms.jpg |title=The Superstar of Superstars |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of fans used to visit theatres repeatedly just to see his fascinating stunts and fight scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/RavikumaronJayan.jpg |title=Heartthrob of millions-Ravikumar remembers Jayan |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daredevilry===
Jayan was a high risk taker and throughout his career, he was popular for stellar performances in fight and stunt sequences. Dangerous and thrilling stunts were often featured in action films with Jayan in the lead. These were usually highlighted during fight scenes as added promotions to his machismo image and daredevilry. Numerous movies in which he has acted have one or more notable stunt performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/jnote0052-1.jpg |title=Dhurantha Nakshathram |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:TheShipCraneStunt.jpg|left|thumbnail|The famed ship crane stunt in the film ''Chandrahasam'']]
A few prominent examples may be ''Puthiya Velicham'' ("New Light", 1979) in which he performs train stunts jumping onto and from a fast running goods train, ''Aavesham'' ("Inspiration", 1979) which shows the actor swimming through the dangerous waters of [[Hogenakkal Falls]], through a major part of the climax sequence without using any kind of safety measures. Movies like ''Thadavara'' ("Prison", 1981) and ''Sharapancharam'' (1979) demonstrate his brilliant horse riding skills performing almost effortlessly on horseback, while films like ''Mamangam'' involved dangerous fights with wild animals. In a film called ''Moorkhan'' ("Cobra", 1981) he broke through a brick wall riding on a motor bike (a Royal Enfield Bullet) and it also featured sequences that had the actor sliding along ropes tied at high elevations. Perhaps the most famous movie stunt featuring Jayan came in ''Chandrahasam'' ("Moonsword", 1980) in which he held on to the UV clamp of a massive ship crane and was elevated to a height of around 200 feet before jumping off to the top of the vessel. In one of his final stunt scenes, in ''Ariyappedatha Rahasyam'' ("Secret never known", 1981) he was involved in a fight scene with an elephant.

==Influence on Malayalam cinema==
The meteoric rise of Jayan had literally a texture changing impact on the Malayalam film industry. It changed forever the hero concept that existed previously for many years and gave rise to a new genre of film characters with more manly characteristics.

===Memorable roles===
Most critics often consider Jayan's main hero role in ''Sharapancharam'', ''Angadi'', ''Venalil Oru Mazha'' and ''Puthiya Velicham'' to be his best. His most popular character may be the educated labourer in ''Angadi''. The sage's role played by him in ''Etho Oru Swapnam'' was well appreciated by critics and would easily feature among his most memorable roles. The supporting role in ''Kannappanunni'', Thacholi Ambu, the villainous ranger in ''Panchami'' and the rapist in ''Kanthavalayam'' are also critically acclaimed characters. Some other popular roles were in films like ''Ithikkara Pakki'', ''Mamangam'', ''Puthiya Velicham'', ''Karimpana'', ''Ariyapedatha Rahasiyam'', ''Chaakara'' and ''[[Kazhukan]]''. While acknowledging his undisputed popularity as a commercial superstar that has never faded over time, general critical opinion on his skills as an actor is divided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i287.photobucket.com/albums/ll137/srikanthdileep/Action%20Hero%20Jayan-%20Memoirs/Jayanarticlebydirector.jpg |title=Jayan sammanicha vismayangal |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are criticisms from some corners that he depended more on his features such as his catching physique, bass voice, personal charisma, unique style and mannerisms to garner attention, many others rate him as a great actor who developed his own unique style to leave a lasting impression on every single role he took up. The fact that his peak time as an actor lasted only a few years is often pointed out in reply to criticisms, and considering the short period of his active film career, he may have delivered more critically appreciated performances than most of his contemporaries. But these were always under the shadow of a large majority of films that were able to achieve commercial success capitalising on his drawing power, but had weak plots and less critical acclaim. Some believe that if he'd had a longer career, he would have eventually transformed into a great character actor over time who could excel in commercial and parallel streams alike, after a period of decline in Malayalam films that followed [[Sathyaneshan Nadar|Sathyan]]'s demise. His most popular films like ''Sharapancharam'' and ''Angadi'' were both critical and commercial successes. Though he is remembered as an icon of commercial cinema, due to the short span of his career and the generic nature of commercial hero roles of the time, his actual acting talents may have been largely underutilised.

===Song sequences===
Film songs are an integral part of Indian cinema and the same is true for Malayalam films. Jayan has acted in several memorable song sequences which bring about nostalgic memories about the actor. Song sequences in Jayan films also helped shape the future film song sector in commercial cinema. The song "Kannum Kannum" in the film ''Angadi'' presents one of the most popular song sequences in Malayalam cinema involving Jayan and Seema. Its success led to the teaming together of this pair in numerous movies. Another popular song involving the Jayan-Seema pair is "Kasthuri Manmizhi" from the movie ''Manushya Mrugam''. A song that hit tremendous popularity was "Cham Chacha Chum Chacha" in ''Love in Singapore'' and Kombil Kilukkam ketti in "Karimpana". The mass popularity of this song sequence later inspired a whole new category of film songs with lyrics that lack any particular meaning, but with a fast beat and dance appeal that came to be known as "Adipoli" songs. There is a song in the film ''Etho Oru Swapnam'' called "Oru Mugham Mathram Kannil", which became popular due to its melodious and nostalgic nature.
"Ezham Malika Mele" from Sarppam, directed by Baby was a superhit song paired by Jayan and Seema. Another hit from this team was "Pournami Penne: in Arifa hassan's ''Benz Vasu'' and it was hummed by the youth of that time.

==Memorials==
There is a Jayan memorial Arts &amp; Sports club functioning at Thevally near the actor's hometown. The residential area at his birthplace has been renamed "Olayil Jayan Nagar" in his honour.

===Jayan Cultural Forum===
''Jayan Samskarika Vethi'' or Jayan Cultural Forum has been established recently, which consists of his fans and well wishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldmalayalamcinema.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/poovachal-khader-conferred-the-ragamalika-jayan-award/ |title=Ragamalika Jayan Award for Poovachal Khader|publisher=Wordpress|date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is headed by the actor's nephew Kannan Nair, and aims at uniting his diverse fan base consisting of young and old people from several generations under a single platform. Activities include organising anniversary functions and memorial programs, facilitating his coworkers, maintaining the actor's website and official profiles and charity work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/malayalamContentView.do?contentId=6277088&amp;programId=7940855&amp;channelId=-1073750705&amp;BV_ID=@@@&amp;tabId=3 |title=Jayan Love U All (2)-Nostalgia-Metro Manorama |publisher=manoramaonline.com |date=2 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monuments===
[[File:JayanStatueHome.jpg|thumb|right |Jayan's statue at his birthplace Olayil in Kollam]]
In 2009, an 8&amp;nbsp;ft high statue of the actor was erected in front of his house at Olayil, Kollam which is now a nursing home. Efforts are being made to construct a permanent memorial at Mulankadakam where he was cremated, and also to open a library and museum near his home.

====Return to the silver screen====
In December 2010, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of his death, it was announced that a new movie with Jayan in the lead is in the works, using advanced animation and graphics technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frames.mathrubhumi.com/movies/malayalam/153194/ |title=Mathrubhumi-Avatharam to have Jayan in the lead |publisher=mathrubhumi.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie, titled ''Avatharam'' (Incarnation), will be directed by [[Vijeesh Mani]] and scripted by T. A. Shahid. The project is inspired by the star's posthumous popularity as an action legend. It was announced that the actor would be brought back to the big screen by twelve top technicians from Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/12/30/stories/2010123063190200.htm |title=The Hindu Report-Return of a matinee Idol |publisher=hindu.com |date= 30 December 2010|accessdate=2011-01-19 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently a man appeared in front of media claiming Jayan's son. His name is Murali Jayan. He says Jayan married his mother Thankamma and his relatives threw Thankamma out of family when Jayan became popular. After Jayan's death Murali filed a case for proving his paternity. The case is rejected since Jayan was no longer alive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mangalam.com/news/detail/177533-latest-news-i-am-biological-son-of-actor-jayan-claims-youth.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marunadanmalayali.com/news/special-report/murali-claims-he-is-actor-jayan-s-son-93256&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumbnail|[[Boris Yeltsin]] and  [[Bill Clinton]] enjoying a joke, in spite of their language differences]]
A '''joke''' is a display of [[humour]] in which words are used within a specific and well-defined narrative structure to make people [[laughter|laugh]] and is not meant to be taken seriously. It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a [[punch line]]. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a [[pun]] or other word play such as [[irony]], a logical incompatibility, nonsense, or other means.  Linguist [[Robert Hetzron]] offers the definition:

{{quote|A joke is a short humorous piece of oral literature in which the funniness culminates in the final sentence, called the punchline… In fact, the main condition is that the tension should reach its highest level at the very end. No continuation relieving the tension should be added. As for its being "oral," it is true that jokes may appear printed, but when further transferred, there is no obligation to reproduce the text verbatim, as in the case of poetry.{{sfn|Hetzron|1991| pp=65–66}}}}

It is generally held that jokes benefit from brevity, containing no more detail than is needed to set the scene for the punchline at the end. In the case of [[riddle joke]]s or one-liners the setting is implicitly understood, leaving only the dialogue and punchline to be verbalised. However, subverting these and other common guidelines can also be a source of humor—the [[shaggy dog story]] is in a class of its own as an [[anti-humor|anti-joke]]; although presenting as a joke, it contains a long drawn-out narrative of time, place and character, rambles through many pointless inclusions and finally fails to deliver a  punchline. Jokes are a form of humour, but not all humour is a joke. Some humorous forms which are ''not'' verbal jokes are:  involuntary humour, situational humour, [[practical jokes]], [[slapstick]] and anecdotes.

Identified as one of the simple forms of oral literature by the Dutch linguist {{Interlanguage link multi|André Jolles|de|3=Johannes Andreas Jolles}},{{sfn|Jolles|1930}} jokes are passed along anonymously. They are told in both private and public settings; a single person tells a joke to his friend in the natural flow of conversation, or a set of jokes is told to a group as part of scripted entertainment. Jokes are also passed along in written form or, more recently, [[Internet humor|through the internet]].

[[Stand-up]] comics, [[comedians]] and [[slapstick]] work with [[comic timing]], precision and [[rhythm]] in their performance, relying as much on actions as on the verbal punchline to evoke laughter. This distinction has been formulated in the popular saying "A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Generally attributed to [[Ed Wynn]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the printed joke ==
[[File:PapyrusWestcar photomerge-AltesMuseum-Berlin-5.jpg|right|upright=1.7|thumb|The [[Westcar Papyrus]], dating to {{circa}} 1600 BC, contains an example of one of the earliest surviving jokes.{{sfn|Joseph|2008}}]]

Any joke documented from the past has been saved through happenstance rather than design. Jokes do not belong to refined culture, but rather to the entertainment and leisure of all classes. As such, any printed versions were considered [[ephemera]], i.e., temporary documents created for a specific purpose and intended to be thrown away. Many of these early jokes deal with scatological and sexual topics, entertaining to all social classes but not to be valued and saved.

Various kinds of jokes have been identified in ancient pre-[[Classical antiquity|classical]] texts.&lt;ref group=note&gt;In 2008, British TV channel [[Dave (TV channel)|''Dave'']] commissioned a team of academics, led by humour expert Paul McDonald from the [[University of Wolverhampton]], to research the world’s oldest examples of recorded humour. Because humour may difficult to define their condition was "a clear set-up and punch line structure". In review, McDonald stated: "...&amp;nbsp;jokes have varied over the years, with some taking the question and answer format while others are witty proverbs or riddles.  What they all share however, is a willingness to deal with taboos and a degree of rebellion. Modern puns, Essex girl jokes and toilet humour can all be traced back to the very earliest jokes identified in this research."{{sfn|Joseph|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest identified joke is an ancient [[Sumer]]ian [[proverb]] from 1900 BC containing [[toilet humour]]: "Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband’s lap." Its records were dated to the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian period]] and the joke may go as far back as 2300 BC. The second oldest joke found, discovered on the [[Westcar Papyrus]] and believed to be about [[Sneferu]], was from [[Ancient Egypt]] circa 1600 BC: "How do you entertain a bored pharaoh? You sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile and urge the pharaoh to go catch a fish." The tale of the three ox drivers from Adab completes the three known oldest jokes in the world. This is a [[Rule of three (writing)#Comedy|comic triple]] dating back to 1200 BC [[Adab (city)|Adab]].{{sfn|Joseph|2008}}

The earliest extant joke book is the ''[[Philogelos]]'' (Greek for ''The Laughter-Lover''), a collection of 265 jokes written in crude [[ancient Greek]] dating to the fourth or fifth century AD.{{sfn|Adams|2008}}{{sfn|Beard|2014|page=185}} The author of the collection is obscure{{sfn|Beard|2014|pages=186-188}} and a number of different authors are attributed to it, including "Hierokles and Philagros the ''grammatikos''", just "Hierokles", or, in the ''[[Suda]]'', "Philistion".{{sfn|Beard|2014|page=188}} British classicist [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] states that the ''Philogelos'' may have been intended as a jokester's handbook of quips to say on the fly, rather than a book meant to be read straight through.{{sfn|Beard|2014|page=188}} Many of the jokes in this collection are surprisingly familiar, even though the typical protagonists are less recognisable to contemporary readers: the [[absent-minded professor]], the eunuch, and people with hernias or bad breath.{{sfn|Adams|2008}} The ''Philogelos'' even contains a joke similar to [[Monty Python]]'s "[[Dead Parrot Sketch]]".{{sfn|Adams|2008}}

[[File:Houghton Typ 520.97.225 - Icones quinquaginta virorum illustrium - Poggio Bracciolini.jpg|thumb|1597 engraving of Poggio Bracciolini]]

[[early modern period|During the 15th century]],{{sfn|Ward|Waller|2000}} the [[Printing press#The Printing Revolution|printing revolution]] spread across Europe following the development of the [[History of printing#Movable type|movable type printing press]]. This was coupled with the growth of literacy in all social classes. Printers turned out [[Jestbook]]s along with Bibles to meet both [[low culture|lowbrow]] and [[highbrow]] interests of the populace. One early anthology of jokes was the [[Facetiae]] by the Italian [[Poggio Bracciolini]], first published in 1470. The popularity of this jest book can be measured on the twenty editions of the book documented alone for the 15th century. Another popular form was a collection of jests, jokes and funny situations attributed to a single character in a more connected, narrative form of the [[picaresque]] novel. Examples of this are the characters of [[Rabelais]] in France, [[Till Eulenspiegel]] in Germany, [[Lazarillo de Tormes]] in Spain and [[John Skelton|Master Skelton]] in England. There is also a jest book ascribed to [[Shakespeare's Jest Book|William Shakespeare]], the contents of which appear to both inform and borrow from his plays. All of these early jestbooks corroborate both the rise in the literacy of the European populations and the general quest for leisure activities during the Renaissance in Europe.{{sfn|Ward|Waller|2000}}

The practice of printers to use jokes and cartoons as page fillers was also widely used in the [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]] and [[chapbook]]s of the 19th century and earlier. With the increase in literacy in the general population and the growth of the printing industry, these publications were the most common forms of printed material between the 16th and 19th centuries throughout Europe and North America. Along with reports of events, executions, ballads and verse, they also contained jokes. Only one of many broadsides archived in the Harvard library is described as "1706. Grinning made easy; or, Funny Dick's unrivalled collection of curious, comical, odd, droll, humorous, witty, whimsical, laughable, and eccentric jests, jokes, bulls, epigrams, &amp;c. With many other descriptions of wit and humour."{{sfn|Lane|1905}} These cheap publications, ephemera intended for mass distribution, were read alone, read aloud, posted and discarded.

There are many types of joke books in print today; a search on the internet provides a plethora of titles available for purchase. They can be read alone for solitary entertainment, or used to stock up on new jokes to entertain friends. Some people try to find a deeper meaning in jokes, as in "Plato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar... Understanding Philosophy Through Jokes".{{sfn|Cathcart|Klein| 2007}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;NPR Interview with the authors Cathcart and Klein can be found at https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10158510&lt;/ref&gt; However a deeper meaning is not necessary to appreciate their inherent entertainment value.{{sfn|Berry|2013}} Magazines frequently use jokes and cartoons as filler for the printed page. ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' closes out many articles with an (unrelated) joke at the bottom of the article. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' was first published in 1925 with the stated goal of being a "sophisticated humour magazine" and is still known for [[The New Yorker#Cartoons|its cartoons]].

== Telling jokes ==
Telling a joke is a cooperative effort;{{sfn|Raskin|1985| p=103}}{{sfn|Attardo|Chabanne|1992}} it requires that the teller and the audience mutually agree in one form or another to understand the narrative which follows as a joke. In a study of [[conversation analysis]], the sociologist [[Harvey Sacks]] describes in detail the sequential organisation in the telling a single joke. "This telling is composed, as for stories, of three serially ordered and adjacently placed types of sequences … the preface [framing], the telling, and the response sequences."{{sfn|Sacks|1974| pp=337–353}} Folklorists expand this to include the context of the joking. Who is telling what jokes to whom? And why is he telling them when?{{sfn|Dundes|1980|pp=20–32}}{{sfn|Bauman|1975}} The context of the joke telling in turn leads into a study of [[joking relationship]]s, a term coined by anthropologists to refer to social groups within a culture who engage in institutionalised banter and joking.

=== Framing: "Have you heard the one…" ===
[[Frame analysis|Framing]] is done with a (frequently formulaic) expression which keys the audience in to expect a joke. "Have you heard the one…", "Reminds me of a joke I heard…", "So, a lawyer and a doctor…"; these conversational markers are just a few examples of linguistic frames used to start a joke. Regardless of the frame used, it creates a social space and clear boundaries around the narrative which follows.{{sfn|Sims|Stephens|2005|p=141}} Audience response to this initial frame can be acknowledgement and anticipation of the joke to follow. It can also be a dismissal, as in "this is no joking matter" or "this is no time for jokes".

Within its performance frame, joke-telling is labelled as a culturally [[marked]] form of communication.  Both the performer and audience understand it to be set apart from the "real" world. "An elephant walks into a bar…"; a native English speaker automatically understands that this is the start of a joke, and the story that follows is not meant to be taken at face value (i.e. it is non-bona-fide communication).{{sfn|Raskin|1992}} The framing itself invokes a play mode; if the audience is unable or unwilling to move into play, then nothing will seem funny.{{sfnm |1a1=Ellis |1y=2002 |1p=3 |2a1=Marcus |2y=2001}}

=== Telling ===
Following its linguistic framing the joke, in the form of a story, can be told. It is not required to be verbatim text like other forms of oral literature such as riddles and proverbs. The teller can and does modify the text of the joke, depending both on memory and the present audience. The important characteristic is that the narrative is succinct, containing only those details which lead directly to an understanding and decoding of the punchline. This requires that it support the same (or similar) divergent scripts which are to be embodied in the punchline.{{sfn|Toelken|1996|p=55}}

The narrative always contains a protagonist who becomes the "butt" or target of the joke. This labelling serves to develop and solidify stereotypes within the culture. It also enables researchers to group and analyse the creation, persistence and interpretation of joke cycles around a certain character. Some people are naturally better performers than others, however anyone can tell a joke because the comic trigger is contained in the narrative text and punchline. A joke poorly told is still funny unless the punchline gets mangled.

=== Punchline ===
The punchline is intended to make the audience laugh. A linguistic interpretation of this punchline / response is elucidated by [[Victor Raskin]] in his [[Theories of humor#Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor|Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour]]. Humour is evoked when a trigger contained in the punchline causes the audience to abruptly shift its understanding of the story from the primary (or more obvious) interpretation to a secondary, opposing interpretation. "The punchline is the pivot on which the joke text turns as it signals the shift between the [semantic] scripts necessary to interpret [re-interpret] the joke text."{{sfn|Carrell|2008|p=308}} To produce the humour in the verbal joke, the two interpretations (i.e. scripts) need to be both compatible with the joke text '''AND''' opposite or incompatible with each other.{{sfn|Raskin|1985|p=99}} Thomas R. Shultz, a psychologist, independently expands Raskin's linguistic theory to include "two stages of incongruity: perception and resolution." He explains that "… incongruity alone is insufficient to account for the structure of humour. […] Within this framework, humour appreciation is conceptualized as a biphasic sequence involving first the discovery of incongruity followed by a resolution of the incongruity."{{sfnm |1a1=Shultz |1y=1976 |1pp=12–13 |2a1=Carrell |2y=2008 |2p=312}} Resolution generates laughter.

This is the point at which the field of [[neurolinguistics]] offers some insight into the cognitive processing involved in this abrupt laughter at the punchline. Studies by the cognitive science researchers Coulson and [[Marta Kutas|Kutas]] directly address the theory of script switching articulated by Raskin in their work.{{sfn|Coulson|Kutas|1998}} The article "Getting it: Human event-related brain response to jokes in good and poor comprehenders" measures brain activity in response to reading jokes.{{sfn|Coulson|Kutas|2001|pp=71–74}} Additional studies by others in the field support more generally the theory of two-stage processing of humour, as evidenced in the longer processing time they require.{{sfn|Attardo|2008|pp=125–126}} In the related field of [[neuroscience]], it has been shown that the expression of laughter is caused by two partially independent neuronal pathways: an "involuntary" or "emotionally driven" system and a "voluntary" system.{{sfn|Wild|Rodden|Grodd|Ruch|2003}} This study adds credence to the common experience when exposed to an [[off-color humor|off-colour]] joke; a laugh is followed in the next breath by a disclaimer: "Oh, that's bad…" Here the multiple steps in cognition are clearly evident in the stepped response, the perception being processed just a breath faster than the resolution of the moral / ethical content in the joke.

=== Responding ===
Expected response to a joke is laughter. The joke teller hopes the audience "gets it" and is entertained. This leads to the premise that a joke is actually an "understanding test" between individuals and groups.{{sfn|Sacks|1974|p=350}} If the listeners do not get the joke, they are not understanding the two scripts which are contained in the narrative as they were intended. Or they do "get it" and don't laugh; it might be too obscene, too gross or too dumb for the current audience. A woman might respond differently to a joke told by a male colleague around the water cooler than she would to the same joke overheard in a women's lavatory. A joke involving [[toilet humour]] may be funnier told on the playground at elementary school than on a college campus. The same joke will elicit different responses in different settings. The punchline in the joke remains the same, however it is more or less appropriate depending on the current context.

=== Shifting contexts, shifting texts ===
The context explores the specific social situation in which joking occurs.{{sfn|Dundes|1980|p=23}} The narrator automatically modifies the text of the joke to be acceptable to different audiences, while at the same time supporting the same divergent scripts in the punchline. The vocabulary used in telling the same joke at a university fraternity party and to one's grandmother might well vary. In each situation it is important to identify both the narrator and the audience as well as their relationship with each other. This varies to reflect the complexities of a matrix of different social factors: age, sex, race, ethnicity, kinship, political views, religion, power relationship, etc. When all the potential combinations of such factors between the narrator and the audience are considered, then a single joke can take on infinite shades of meaning for each unique social setting.

The context, however, should not be confused with the function of the joking. "Function is essentially an abstraction made on the basis of a number of contexts".{{sfn|Dundes|1980|pp=23–24}} In one long-term observation of men coming off the late shift at a local café, joking with the waitresses was used to ascertain sexual availability for the evening. Different types of jokes, going from general to topical into explicitly sexual humour signalled openness on the part of the waitress for a connection.{{sfnm |1a1=Walle |1y=1976 |2a1=Oring |2y=2008 |2p=201}} This study describes how jokes and joking are used to communicate much more than just good humour. That is a single example of the function of joking in a social setting, but there are others. Sometimes jokes are used simply to get to know someone better. What makes them laugh, what do they find funny? Jokes concerning politics, religion or sexual topics can be used effectively to gage the attitude of the audience to any one of these topics. They can also be used as a marker of group identity, signalling either inclusion or exclusion for the group. Among pre-adolescents, "dirty" jokes allow them to share information about their changing bodies.{{sfn|Sims|Stephens|2005|p=39}} And sometimes joking is just simple entertainment for a group of friends.

=== Joking relationships ===
The context of joking in turn leads into a study of [[joking relationship]]s, a term coined by anthropologists to refer to social groups within a culture who take part in institutionalised banter and joking. These relationships can be either one-way or a mutual back and forth between partners. "The joking relationship is defined as a peculiar combination of friendliness and antagonism. The behaviour is such that in any other social context it would express and arouse hostility; but it is not meant seriously and must not be taken seriously. There is a pretence of hostility along with a real friendliness. To put it in another way, the relationship is one of permitted disrespect."{{sfn| Radcliffe-Brown |1940|p=196}} Joking relationships were first described by anthropologists within kinship groups in Africa. But they have since been identified in cultures around the world, where jokes and joking are used to mark and re-inforce appropriate boundaries of a relationship.{{sfn|Apte|1985}}

== Electronic joking ==
The advent of [[electronic communication]]s at the end of the 20th century introduced new traditions into jokes. A verbal joke or cartoon is [[email]]ed to a friend or posted on a [[bulletin board]]; reactions include a replied email with [[Smiley|a :-)]] or [[LOL]], or a [[Email forwarding|forward]] on to further recipients. Interaction is limited to the computer screen and for the most part solitary. While preserving the text of a joke, both context and variants are lost in internet joking; for the most part emailed jokes are passed along verbatim.{{sfn|Frank|2009|pp=99–100}} The framing of the joke frequently occurs in the subject line: "RE: laugh for the day" or something similar. The forward of an email joke can increase the number of recipients exponentially.

[[Internet humor|Internet joking]] forces a re-evaluation of social spaces and social groups. They are no longer only defined by physical presence and locality, they also exist in the connectivity in cyberspace.{{sfn|Mason|1998}} "The computer networks appear to make possible communities that, although physically dispersed, display attributes of the direct, unconstrained, unofficial exchanges folklorists typically concern themselves with".{{sfn|Dorst|1990|pp=180–181}} This is particularly evident in the spread of topical jokes, "that genre of lore in which whole crops of jokes spring up seemingly overnight around some sensational event … flourish briefly and then disappear, as the mass media move on to fresh maimings and new collective tragedies".{{sfn|Dorst|1990}} This correlates with the new understanding of the internet as an "active folkloric space" with evolving social and cultural forces and clearly identifiable performers and audiences.{{sfn|Dorst|1990| p=183}}

A study by the folklorist Bill Ellis documented how an evolving cycle was circulated over the internet.{{sfn|Ellis|2002}} By accessing message boards that specialised in humour immediately following the 9/11 disaster, Ellis was able to observe in real time both the topical jokes being posted electronically and responses to the jokes. "Previous folklore research has been limited to collecting and documenting successful jokes, and only after they had emerged and come to folklorists' attention. Now, an Internet-enhanced collection creates a time machine, as it were, where we can observe what happens in the period before the risible moment, when attempts at humour are unsuccessful".{{sfn|Ellis|2002|p=2}} Access to archived message boards also enables us to track the development of a single joke thread in the context of a more complicated virtual conversation.{{sfn|Ellis|2002}}

== Joke cycles ==
{{main category|Joke cycles}}
A '''joke cycle''' is a collection of jokes about a single target or situation which displays consistent narrative structure and type of humour. Some well-known cycles are [[elephant joke]]s using nonsense humour, [[dead baby jokes]] incorporating black humour and [[light bulb jokes]], which describe all kinds of operational stupidity. Joke cycles can centre on ethnic groups, professions ([[viola jokes]]), catastrophes, settings [[Bar joke|(…walks into a bar)]], absurd characters ([[Wind-up doll joke|wind-up dolls]]), or logical mechanisms which generate the humour ([[knock-knock jokes]]). A joke can be reused in different joke cycles; an example of this is the same [[Head &amp; Shoulders]] joke refitted to the tragedies of [[Vic Morrow]], [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Admiral Mountbatten]] and the crew of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger space shuttle]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;How do we know that ___ had dandruff? They found his/her head and shoulders on the ___.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gruner|1997|pp=142–143}} These cycles seem to appear spontaneously, spread rapidly across countries and borders only to dissipate after some time. Folklorists and others have studied individual joke cycles in an attempt to understand their function and significance within the culture.

=== Tragedies and catastrophes ===
As with the [[9/11]] disaster discussed above, cycles attach themselves to celebrities or national catastrophes such as the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], the [[death of Michael Jackson]], and the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]]. These cycles arise regularly as a response to terrible unexpected events which command the national news. An in-depth analysis of the Challenger joke cycle documents a change in the type of humour circulated following the disaster, from February to March 1986. "It shows that the jokes appeared in distinct 'waves', the first responding to the disaster with clever wordplay and the second playing with grim and troubling images associated with the event…The primary social function of disaster jokes appears to be to provide closure to an event that provoked communal grieving, by signaling that it was time to move on and pay attention to more immediate concerns".{{sfn|Ellis|1991}}

=== Ethnic jokes ===
The sociologist [[Christie Davies]] has written extensively on ethnic jokes told in countries around the world.{{sfn|Davies|1990}} In ethnic jokes he finds that the "stupid" ethnic target in the joke is no stranger to the culture, but rather a peripheral social group (geographic, economic, cultural, linguistic) well known to the joke tellers.{{sfn|Davies|2008|pages=163–165}} So Americans tell jokes about Polacks and Italians, Germans tell jokes about Ostfriesens, and the English tell jokes about the Irish. In a review of Davies' theories it is said that "For Davies, [ethnic] jokes are more about how joke tellers imagine themselves than about how they imagine those others who serve as their putative targets…The jokes thus serve to center one in the world – to remind people of their place and to reassure them that they are in it."{{sfn|Oring|2000}}

=== Absurdities and gallows humour ===
A third category of joke cycles identifies absurd characters as the butt: for example the grape, the dead baby or the elephant. Beginning in the 1960s, social and cultural interpretations of these joke cycles, spearheaded by the folklorist [[Alan Dundes]], began to appear in academic journals. Dead baby jokes are posited to reflect societal changes and guilt caused by widespread use of contraception and abortion beginning in the 1960s.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Combined oral contraceptive pill|Contraceptive pills]] were first approved for use in the United States in 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dundes|1987|pp=3–14}} Elephant jokes have been interpreted variously as stand-ins for American blacks during the Civil Rights Era{{sfn|Dundes|1987|pp=41–54}} or as an "image of something large and wild abroad in the land captur[ing] the sense of counterculture" of the sixties.{{sfn|Oring|2008|p=194}} These interpretations strive for a cultural understanding of the themes of these jokes which go beyond the simple collection and documentation undertaken previously by folklorists and ethnologists.

== Classification systems ==
As folktales and other types of oral literature became collectibles throughout Europe in the 19th century ([[Brothers Grimm]] et al.), folklorists and anthropologists of the time needed a system to organise these items. The [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]] was first published in 1910 by [[Antti Aarne]], and later expanded by [[Stith Thompson]] to become the most renowned classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. Its final section addresses [[Aarne–Thompson classification system#Anecdotes and jokes|anecdotes and jokes]], listing traditional humorous tales ordered by their protagonist; "This section of the Index is essentially a classification of the older European jests, or merry tales – humorous stories characterized by short, fairly simple plots. …"{{sfnm |1a1=Brunvand |1y=1968 |1p=238 |2a1=Dundes |2y=1997}} Due to its focus on older tale types and obsolete actors (e.g., numbskull), the Aarne–Thompson Index does not provide much help in identifying and classifying the modern joke.

A more granular classification system used widely by folklorists and cultural anthropologists is the [[Motif (folkloristics)#Thompson.E2.80.99s Motif-Index|Thompson Motif Index]], which separates tales into their individual [[Motif (folkloristics)|story elements]]. This system enables jokes to be classified according to individual motifs included in the narrative: actors, items and incidents. It does not provide a system to classify the text by more than one element at a time while at the same time making it theoretically possible to classify the same text under multiple motifs.{{sfn|Dundes|1997}}

The Thompson Motif Index has spawned further specialised motif indices, each of which focuses on a single aspect of one subset of jokes. A sampling of just a few of these specialised indices have been listed under [[Motif (folkloristics)#Other motif indices|other motif indices]]. Here one can select an index for medieval Spanish folk narratives,{{sfn|Goldberg|1998}} another index for linguistic verbal jokes,{{sfn|Lew|1996}} and a third one for sexual humour.{{sfn|Legman|1968}} To assist the researcher with this increasingly confusing situation, there are also multiple bibliographies of indices{{sfn|Azzolina|1987}} as well as a how-to guide on creating your own index.{{sfn|Jason|2000}}

Several difficulties have been identified with these systems of identifying oral narratives according to either tale types or story elements.{{sfn|Apo|1997}} A first major problem is their hierarchical organisation; one element of the narrative is selected as the major element, while all other parts are arrayed subordinate to this. A second problem with these systems is that the listed motifs are not qualitatively equal; actors, items and incidents are all considered side-by-side.{{sfn|Dundes| 1962}} And because incidents will always have at least one actor and usually have an item, most narratives can be ordered under multiple headings. This leads to confusion about both where to order an item and where to find it. A third significant problem is that the "excessive prudery" common in the middle of the 20th century means that obscene, sexual and scatological elements were regularly ignored in many of the indices.{{sfn|Dundes|1997|p=198}}

The folklorist Robert Georges has summed up the concerns with these existing classification systems: {{quote|…Yet what the multiplicity and variety of sets and subsets reveal is that folklore [jokes] not only takes many forms, but that it is also multifaceted, with purpose, use, structure, content, style, and function all being relevant and important. Any one or combination of these multiple and varied aspects of a folklore example [such as jokes] might emerge as dominant in a specific situation or for a particular inquiry.{{sfn|Georges|1997|page=111}}}} It has proven difficult to organise all different elements of a joke into a multi-dimensional classification system which could be of real value in the study and evaluation of this (primarily oral) complex narrative form.

The [[Theories of humor#General Theory of Verbal Humor|General Theory of Verbal Humour]] or GTVH, developed by the linguists [[Victor Raskin]] and [[Salvatore Attardo]], attempts to do exactly this. This classification system was developed specifically for jokes and later expanded to include longer types of humorous narratives.{{sfn|Attardo|2001}} Six different aspects of the narrative, labelled Knowledge Resources or KRs, can be evaluated largely independently of each other, and then combined into a concatenated classification label. These six KRs of the joke structure include: 
# '''Script Opposition (SO)''' references the script opposition included in Raskin's SSTH. This includes, among others, themes such as real (unreal), actual (non-actual), normal (abnormal), possible (impossible). 
# '''Logical Mechanism (LM)''' refers to the mechanism which connects the different scripts in the joke. These can range from a simple verbal technique like a pun to more complex LMs such as faulty logic or false analogies. 
# '''Situation (SI)''' can include objects, activities, instruments, props needed to tell the story. 
# '''Target (TA)''' identifies the actor(s) who become the "butt" of the joke. This labelling serves to develop and solidify stereotypes of ethnic groups, professions, etc.
# '''Narrative strategy (NS)''' addresses the narrative format of the joke, as either a simple narrative, a dialogue, or a riddle. It attempts to classify the different genres and subgenres of verbal humour. In a subsequent study Attardo expands the NS to include oral and printed humorous narratives of any length, not just jokes.{{sfn|Attardo|2001}}
# '''Language (LA) ''' "…contains all the information necessary for the verbalization of a text. It is responsible for the exact wording …and for the placement of the functional elements."{{sfn|Attardo|1994|p=223}}

As development of the GTVH progressed, a hierarchy of the KRs was established to partially restrict the options for lower level KRs depending on the KRs defined above them. For example, a lightbulb joke (SI) will always be in the form of a riddle (NS). Outside of these restrictions, the KRs can create a multitude of combinations, enabling a researcher to select jokes for analysis which contain only one or two defined KRs. It also allows for an evaluation of the similarity or dissimilarity of jokes depending on the similarity of their labels. "The GTVH presents itself as a mechanism … of generating [or describing] an infinite number of jokes by combining the various values that each parameter can take. … Descriptively, to analyze a joke in the GTVH consists of listing the values of the 6 KRs (with the caveat that TA and LM may be empty)."{{sfn|Attardo|2001|p=27}} This classification system provides a functional multi-dimensional label for any joke, and indeed any verbal humour.

== Joke and humour research ==
Many academic disciplines lay claim to the study of jokes (and other forms of humour) as within their purview. Fortunately there are enough jokes, good, bad and worse, to go around. Unfortunately the studies of jokes from each of the interested disciplines brings to mind the tale of the [[blind men and an elephant]] where the observations, although accurate reflections of their own competent methodological inquiry, frequently fail to grasp the beast in its entirety.  This attests to the joke as a traditional narrative form which is indeed complex, concise and complete in and of itself.{{sfn|Attardo|Chabanne|1992|p=172}} It requires a "multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and cross-disciplinary field of inquiry"{{sfn|Apte|1988|p=7}} to truly appreciate these nuggets of cultural insight.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Our focus here is with the contemporary state of joke research. A more extensive survey of the history of various humour theories can be found under the topic [[theories of humor]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dundes|1972}}

=== Psychology ===
[[File:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|Sigmund Freud]]
Sigmund Freud was one of the first modern scholars to recognise jokes as an important object of investigation.{{sfn|Carrell|2008|p=304}} In his 1905 study ''[[Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious]]''{{sfn|Freud|1905}} Freud describes the social nature of humour and illustrates his text with many examples of contemporary Viennese jokes.{{sfn|Oring|1984}} His work is particularly noteworthy in this context because Freud distinguishes in his writings between jokes, humour and the comic.{{sfn|Morreall|2008|p=224}} These are distinctions which become easily blurred in many subsequent studies where everything funny tends to be gathered under the umbrella term of "humour", making for a much more diffuse discussion.

Since the publication of Freud's study, psychologists have continued to explore humour and jokes in their quest to explain, predict and control an individual's "sense of humour". Why do people laugh? Why do people find something funny? Can jokes predict character, or vice versa, can character predict the jokes an individual laughs at? What is a "sense of humour"? A current review of the popular magazine ''[[Psychology Today]]'' lists over 200 articles discussing various aspects of humour; in psychospeak{{neologism inline|date=October 2016}} the subject area has become both an emotion to measure and a tool to use in diagnostics and treatment. A new psychological assessment tool, the [[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|Values in Action Inventory]] developed by the American psychologists [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman]] includes humour (and playfulness) as one of the core character strengths of an individual. As such, it could be a good predictor of life satisfaction.{{sfn|Ruch|2008|p=47}} For psychologists, it would be useful to measure both how much of this strength an individual has and how it can be measurably increased.

A 2007 survey of existing tools to measure humour identified more than 60 psychological measurement instruments.{{sfn|Ruch|2008|p=58}} These measurement tools use many different approaches to quantify humour along with its related states and traits. There are tools to measure an individual's physical response by their [[smile]]; the [[Facial Action Coding System]] (FACS) is one of several tools used to identify any one of multiple types of smiles.{{sfn|Furnham|2014}} Or the [[laugh]] can be measured to calculate the funniness response of an individual; multiple [[Laughter#Types|types of laughter]] have been identified. It must be stressed here that both smiles and laughter are not always a response to something funny. In trying to develop a measurement tool, most systems use "jokes and cartoons" as their test materials. However, because no two tools use the same jokes, and across languages this would not be feasible, how does one determine that the assessment objects are comparable? Moving on, whom does one ask to rate the sense of humour of an individual? Does one ask the person themselves, an impartial observer, or their family, friends and colleagues? Furthermore, has the current mood of the test subjects been considered; someone with a recent death in the family might not be much prone to laughter. Given the plethora of variants revealed by even a superficial glance at the problem,{{sfn|Ruch|2008|pp=40–45}} it becomes evident that these paths of scientific inquiry are mined with problematic pitfalls and questionable solutions.

The psychologist {{Interlanguage link multi|Willibald Ruch|de}} has been very active in the research of humour. He has collaborated with the linguists Raskin and Attardo on their General Theory of Verbal Humour (GTVH) classification system. Their goal is to empirically test both the six autonomous classification types (KRs) and the hierarchical ordering of these KRs. Advancement in this direction would be a win-win for both fields of study; linguistics would have empirical verification of this multi-dimensional classification system for jokes, and psychology would have a standardised joke classification with which they could develop verifiably comparable measurement tools.

=== Linguistics ===
"The linguistics of humor has made gigantic strides forward in the last decade and a half and replaced the psychology of humor as the most advanced theoretical approach to the study of this important and universal human faculty."{{sfn|Raskin|1992|p=91}} This recent statement by one noted linguist and humour researcher describes, from his perspective, contemporary linguistic humour research. [[Linguistics|Linguists]] study words, how words are strung together to build sentences, how sentences create meaning which can be communicated from one individual to another, how our interaction with each other using words creates [[Discourse Analysis|discourse]]. Jokes have been defined above as oral narrative in which words and sentences are engineered to build toward a punchline. The linguist's question is: what exactly makes the punchline funny? This question focuses on how the words used in the punchline create humour, in contrast to the psychologist's concern (see above) with the audience response to the punchline. The assessment of humour by psychologists "is made from the individual's perspective; e.g. the phenomenon associated with responding to or creating humor and not a description of humor itself."{{sfn|Ruch|2008|p=19}} Linguistics, on the other hand, endeavours to provide a precise description of what makes a text funny.{{sfn|Ruch|2008|p=25}}

Two major new linguistic theories have been developed and tested within the last decades. The first was advanced by Victor Raskin in "Semantic Mechanisms of Humor", published 1985.{{sfn|Raskin|1985}} While being a variant on the more general concepts of the [[Theories of humor#Incongruity theory|incongruity theory of humour]], it is the first theory to identify its approach as exclusively linguistic. The [[Theories of humor#Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor|Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour]] (SSTH) begins by identifying two linguistic conditions which make a text funny. It then goes on to identify the mechanisms involved in creating the punchline. This theory established the semantic/pragmatic foundation of humour as well as the humour competence of speakers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. The necessary and sufficient conditions for a text to be funny&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Attardo|2001|p=114}}

Several years later the SSTH was incorporated into a more expansive theory of jokes put forth by Raskin and his colleague Salvatore Attardo. In the [[Theories of humor#General Theory of Verbal Humor|General Theory of Verbal Humour]], the SSTH was relabelled as a Logical Mechanism (LM) (referring to the mechanism which connects the different linguistic scripts in the joke) and added to five other independent Knowledge Resources (KR). Together these six KRs could now function as a multi-dimensional descriptive label for any piece of humorous text.

Linguistics has developed further methodological tools which can be applied to jokes: [[discourse analysis]] and [[conversation analysis]] of joking. Both of these subspecialties within the field focus on "naturally occurring" language use, i.e. the analysis of real (usually recorded) conversations. One of these studies has already been discussed above, where Harvey Sacks describes in detail the sequential organisation in the telling a single joke.{{sfn|Sacks|1974}} Discourse analysis emphasises the entire context of social joking, the social interaction which cradles the words.

=== Folklore and anthropology ===
[[Folklore]] and [[cultural anthropology]] have perhaps the strongest claims on jokes as belonging to their bailiwick. Jokes remain one of the few remaining forms of traditional folk literature transmitted orally in western cultures. Identified as one of the "simple forms" of oral literature by {{Interlanguage link multi|André Jolles|de|3=Johannes Andreas Jolles}} in 1930,{{sfn|Jolles|1930}} they have been collected and studied since there were folklorists and anthropologists abroad in the lands. As a genre they were important enough at the beginning of the 20th century to be included under their own heading in the Aarne–Thompson index first published in 1910: [[Aarne–Thompson classification system#Anecdotes and jokes|Anecdotes and jokes]].

Beginning in the 1960s, cultural researchers began to expand their role from collectors and archivists of "folk ideas"{{sfn|Dundes|1972}} to a more active role of interpreters of cultural artefacts. One of the foremost scholars active during this transitional time was the folklorist Alan Dundes. He started asking questions of tradition and transmission with the key observation that "No piece of folklore continues to be transmitted unless it means something, even if neither the speaker nor the audience can articulate what that meaning might be."{{sfn|Dundes|Pagter|1987| p=vii}} In the context of jokes, this then becomes the basis for further research. Why is the joke told right now? Only in this expanded perspective is an understanding of its meaning to the participants possible.

This questioning resulted in a blossoming of monographs to explore the significance of many joke cycles. What is so funny about absurd nonsense elephant jokes? Why make light of dead babies? In an article on contemporary German jokes about Auschwitz and the Holocaust, Dundes justifies this research:  "Whether one finds Auschwitz jokes funny or not is not an issue. This material exists and should be recorded. Jokes are always an important barometer of the attitudes of a group. The jokes exist and they obviously must fill some psychic need for those individuals who tell them and those who listen to them."{{sfn|Dundes|Hauschild|1983|p=250}} A stimulating generation of new humour theories flourishes like mushrooms in the undergrowth: [[Elliott Oring]]'s theoretical discussions on "appropriate ambiguity" and Amy Carrell's hypothesis of an "audience-based theory of verbal humor (1993)" to name just a few.

In his book ''Humor and Laughter: An Anthropological Approach'',{{sfn|Apte|1985}} the anthropologist Mahadev Apte presents a solid case for his own academic perspective.{{sfn|Apte|2002}} "Two axioms underlie my discussion, namely, that humor is by and large culture based and that humor can be a major conceptual and methodological tool for gaining insights into cultural systems." Apte goes on to call for legitimising the field of humour research as "humorology"; this would be a field of study incorporating an interdisciplinary character of humour studies.{{sfn|Apte|1988}}

While the label "humorology" has yet to become a household word, great strides are being made in the international recognition of this interdisciplinary field of research. The International Society for Humor Studies was founded in 1989 with the stated purpose to "promote, stimulate and encourage the interdisciplinary study of humour; to support and cooperate with local, national, and international organizations having similar purposes; to organize and arrange meetings; and to issue and encourage publications concerning the purpose of the society." It also publishes ''[[Humor: International Journal of Humor Research]]'' and holds yearly conferences to promote and inform its speciality.

=== Computational humour ===
[[Computational humor|Computational humour]] is a new field of study which uses computers to model humour;{{sfn|Mulder|Nijholt|2002}} it bridges the disciplines of [[computational linguistics]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. A primary ambition of this field is to develop computer programs which can both generate a joke and recognise a text snippet as a joke. Early programming attempts have dealt almost exclusively with punning because this lends itself to simple straightforward rules. These primitive programs display no intelligence; instead they work off a template with a finite set of pre-defined punning options upon which to build.

More sophisticated computer joke programs have yet to be developed. Based on our understanding of the [[Theories of humor#Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor|SSTH]] / [[Theories of humor#General Theory of Verbal Humor|GTVH]] humour theories, it is easy to see why. The linguistic scripts (a.k.a. frames) referenced in these theories include, for any given word, a "large chunk of semantic information surrounding the word and evoked by it [...] a cognitive structure internalized by the native speaker".{{sfn|Raskin|1985|p=46}} These scripts extend much further than the [[lexical definition]] of a word; they contain the speaker's complete knowledge of the concept as it exists in his world. As insentient machines, computers lack the encyclopaedic scripts which humans gain through life experience. They also lack the ability to gather the experiences needed to build wide-ranging semantic scripts and understand language in a broader context, a context that any child picks up in daily interaction with his environment.

Further development in this field must wait until computational linguists have succeeded in programming a computer with an [[Semantic network|ontological semantic]] natural language processing system. It is only "the most complex linguistic structures [which] can serve any formal and/or computational treatment of humor well".{{sfn|Raskin|2008|page=17/349}} Toy systems (i.e. dummy punning programs) are completely inadequate to the task. Despite the fact that the field of computational humour is small and underdeveloped, it is encouraging to note the many interdisciplinary efforts which are currently underway.{{sfn|Hempelmann|Samson|2008|p=354}} As this field grows in both understanding and methodology, it provides an ideal testbed for humour theories; the rules must firstly be cleanly defined in order to write a computer program around a theory.

=== Physiology of laughter ===
[[File:Charles Darwin by Julia Margaret Cameron 2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Three quarter length portrait of sixty-year-old man, balding, with white hair and long white bushy beard, with heavy eyebrows shading his eyes looking thoughtfully into the distance, wearing a wide lapelled jacket.|Charles Darwin in his later years.]]
In 1872, [[Charles Darwin]] published one of the first "comprehensive and in many ways remarkably accurate description of laughter in terms of respiration, vocalization, facial action and gesture and posture" (Laughter).{{sfn|Ruch|2008|p=24}} In this early study Darwin raises further questions about who laughs and why they laugh; the myriad responses since then illustrates the complexities of this behaviour. To understand laughter in humans and other primates, the science of [[gelotology]] (from the Greek ''{{lang|grc|gelos}}'', meaning laughter) has been established; it is the study of [[laughter]] and its effects on the body from both a [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] perspective. While jokes can provoke laughter, laughter cannot be used as a one-to-one marker of jokes because there are multiple stimuli to laugher, humour being just one of them. The other six causes of laughter listed are: social context, ignorance, anxiety, derision, acting apology, and tickling.{{sfnm |1a1=Giles |1a2=Oxford |1y=1970 |2a1=Attardo |2y=2008 |2pp=116–117}} As such, the study of laughter is a secondary albeit entertaining perspective in an understanding of jokes.

'''''Keith Broke His Leg''''' is an American [[comedy]] [[web series]] created by [[Keith Powell]].  It premiered its first six episodes on August 25, 2015 through its official website, and released subsequent episodes intermittently through September 2016.&lt;ref name="tvinsider.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvinsider.com/article/35426/30-rocks-toofer-breaks-out-watch-first-episodes-of-keith-powells-new-series-exclusive/|title=30 Rock‘s Toofer Breaks Out: Watch First Episodes of Keith Powell’s New Series (Exclusive) – TV Insider|work=TV Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set in Powell's home, and inspired by his real life, the show follows Keith through a series of visits with his friends and family while he recuperates from an unknown accident that left his right leg broken. Most guest actors who appear in the show play a parody version of themselves, including [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[Fiona Gubelmann]], [[Malcolm Barrett (actor)|Malcolm Barrett]], [[Leonard Robinson]], and [[Alexandra Krosney]].  Powell writes, directs, and produces all episodes in addition to starring.

Upon its release, the show received much publicity due to Powell blogging for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', which highlighted each episode of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/keith-powell/|title=Keith Powell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The blogs discussed race, politics, relationships, friendship, marriage, and other current events as it relates to specific moments in the web series.  Particularly, his blog post highlighting the "You Talk White" phenomenon (promoting the episode "Baller") received widespread attention on ''[[NPR]]'', ''[[HuffPost Live]]'', and various international news blogs.&lt;ref&gt;http://feeds.feedburner.com/ttbook&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/keith-powell/you-talk-white-being-blac_b_8284582.html|title='You Talk White:' Being Black and Articulate|date=13 October 2015|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/30-rock-twofer-keith-powell-broke-his-leg/564268cb99ec6d499100015c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/black-30-rock-actor-claims-police-said-he-was-privileged-to-live-in-a-nice-neighbourhood-a6746516.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Series overview ==
The series is a semi-autobiographical comedy about ''[[30 Rock]]'' star Keith Powell's self-discovery when he is suddenly stripped of his ability to be mobile. After an accident, Keith is forced to see the world in a new way when his wife, his friends, and especially his agent don’t make life easy for the incapacitated. What results is a series of visits with the floura and fauna of the Hollywood comedy world, with most of the actors playing parodies of themselves. The style of the show is slower-paced and more observational than traditional comedies, with elements of drama, surrealism, and philosophy throughout. Powell has described the show as contemplative with "earned" jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/blog/post/behind-the-video-keith-powell-on-truth-race-and-ea|title=Behind the video: Keith Powell on truth, race &amp; earned jokes|work=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Powell self-funded the first season, citing the personal nature of the project and his reluctance to initially crowdfund.  He wrote an article on [[IndieWire]] detailing his process.&lt;ref name="keithpowell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/30-rock-star-keith-powell-secret-to-making-a-great-web-series-on-a-tiny-budget-20150918|title='30 Rock' Star Keith Powell's Secret to Making a Great Se – Indiewire|author=Keith Powell|date=18 September 2015|work=Indiewire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is filmed on location in [[Los Angeles, California]] in Powell's real life home.  Additionally, the home was featured on [[HGTV]]'s "[[House Hunters]] Renovation" and "House Hunters Where Are They Now?"

The color palette of the show is highly saturated, highlighting the colors blue and red.  Powell has stated that the entire production time took longer than usual due to the low budget of the series.  In addition, Powell employed the use of drone cameras to take the place of cranes and dollies, and the series was shot exclusively on DSLR cameras.&lt;ref name="keithpowell"/&gt;

The theme song is composed by [[30 Rock]] co-composer Giancarlo Vulcano, inspired by the Motown sound of the 1960s.  Vulcano also collaborated with Powell for the score of ''[[My Name Is David]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giancarlovulcano.com/|title=GIANCARLOVULCANO.COM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
After the release of the first six episodes, [[Tubefilter]] called the series a "sleek, well shot, reasonably funny web series" and concluded "it's a nice way to spend an hour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2015/08/25/keith-powell-broke-his-leg-web-series/|title=Keith Powell Of ‘30 Rock’ Breaks A Leg In New Web Series|work=Tubefilter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[TV Insider]] stated "For seven seasons, Keith Powell was 30 Rock’s uptight and under-appreciated “Toofer” Spurlock, but now, the man who battled Frank Rossitano for the right to wear Harvard gear and battled Tracy Jordan over a certain word is stepping, with the help of crutches, into his own spotlight."&lt;ref name="tvinsider.com"/&gt;  Review &amp; Roast pointed out that Powell and Knox "played well off each other and it was obvious they had real chemistry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewandroast.com/keith-broke-his-leg/review/|title=Review – Review and Roast|work=Review and Roast}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the show at the [[Raindance Film Festival]], Vodzilla noted the show's dry pace, stating, "That mundane approach makes for a relatable series which lacks in laugh-out-loud moments but builds up to them with a restraint and gentle tone that makes them more satisfying... there’s surprising substance here." &lt;ref&gt;http://vodzilla.co/reviews/raindance-web-fest-2016-reviews-il-sonnambulo-keith-broke-his-leg-match-not-found-almost-asian/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and nominations===
In 2016, Powell won the Best Actor (Comedy) award at the [[New York Television Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiewire.com/2016/10/new-york-television-festival-award-winners-nytvf-1201741579/&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was nominated for seven 2016 [[Indie Series Awards]], winning two, including Best Web Series – Comedy.&lt;ref name="7th Indie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indieseriesawards.com/2016/02/nominations-announced-for-7th-annual.html |date=February 3, 2016 |title=Nominations Announced For 7th Annual ISAs |publisher=Indie Series Awards |accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, it was nominated for an additional six [[Indie Series Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indieseriesnetwork.org/2017/02/nominees-announced-for-8th-annual-indie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kickboxer 4: The Aggressor''''' is a 1994 direct-to-video release martial-arts film directed by [[Albert Pyun]]. The film is the fourth entry in the [[Kickboxer (film series)|''Kickboxer'' franchise]]. This was the last film to star [[Sasha Mitchell]], who reprises his role as David Sloane.

== Plot ==
The film opens with a recap of earlier events in the series as David Sloane writes a letter to his wife, Vicky. After being framed for murder by Tong Po, Sloane has spent the last two years in prison, while his wife has become the sexual captive of his old nemesis, who has since become one of the most powerful drug lords in [[Mexico]]. 

After receiving explicit photos from Po of his kidnapped wife, Sloane takes his frustrations out on a fellow prisoner before meeting with a [[DEA]] official, Casey Ford ([[Nicholas Guest]]), who briefs Sloane about their situation. He reveals that the agency has been unable to apprehend Po by their own means and that Po intends to host a martial arts tournament at his private compound, with the winner earning a match against Po and a $1,000,000 cash prize. Knowing the history between them, Casey offers to release Sloane if he will enter the tournament and eliminate Po himself. Sloane eagerly accepts, using the alias "Jack Jones" to conceal his identity. His first stop is a street fight, where he easily dispatches two street fighters earning him a necessary invitation from a man named Brubaker, who scouts fighters and invites them to Po's tournament. 

On his way to the border, Sloane enters a roadside bar and stumbles upon a group of thugs harassing a young woman named Megan Laurence. Sloane defeats them with ease and saves the woman, who is ungrateful for his help and reveals that she is entering the tournament as well. Sloane arrives at the compound and is greeted by Darcy Cove, one of Po's many female sex slaves, who tells him that he must compete in the qualifying matches. Sloane witnesses Thomas, a brutal fighter, take out another young fighter. Then, Sloane is chosen to face Laurence. Reluctant to harm the young woman despite her taunting, Sloane peacefully subdues her. He also meets up with an old acquaintance named Lando Smith, a talented fighter who turns out to be his backup on the mission. 

At the party of the tournament's seventh anniversary, Bill, Po's right hand man, introduces Tong Po to the crowd. Sloane leaves the party soon after to search for his wife, but finds the entire compound to be heavily guarded. Meanwhile, Po offers Laurence a second opportunity to compete, but places a bounty on her head inciting all the other fighters to attack her at once. Laurence holds her own until Po attacks her, prompting Lando to intervene. After a brief standoff with Po, Lando escorts Laurence back to her room.

That night, Sloane searches the compound and manages to locate his wife, but is unable to free her before the alarm sounds. On Po's orders, the guards try to apprehend him, but they fail and Sloane escapes. The next morning, Sloane befriends Laurence and offers his help for the upcoming tournament. 

The tournament begins with several matches taking place. Sloane witnesses Thomas incapacitate a female judoka fighter (Dana Dru Evenson), while Lando and Laurence both win their respective matches. When Sloane (as "Jack Jones") is called up to fight, Lando approaches Darcy to divert Po's attention away from him. Sloane wins his fight quickly and escapes Po's notice. 

In an effort to gain more intelligence about Sloane's wife, Lando enters a romance with Darcy and presses her for information while offering to help her escape from Po. Darcy provides him with the necessary intel which he passes on to Sloane before being caught by Bill and his guards. Po tortures Lando to learn why he has come to the tournament, but unable to get a satisfactory answer, he brings forth Darcy and tortures her in front of Lando forcing him to admit that he is a DEA agent. Lando pleads for Darcy's life, but Po tortures her to death. 

Meanwhile, Sloane seeks to free his wife, but is unable to find her since Po had her moved from her original cell as a result of his previous intrusion. Sloane is then captured by Po, who is surprised to see his old rival. On the final day of the tournament, Po declares that all fights will be to the death and dismisses several fighters who are unwilling to risk their lives, but shoots them all dead as they depart. The tournament proceeds with even more fighters killed at the hands of their opponents, until both Lando and Sloane are dragged into the arena. 

Po announces that the tournament is a memorial to his late wife, Sian, who was killed five years prior when the DEA invaded his home. He blames Sloane for her death and offers a $500,000 bonus to whoever is able to defeat Sloane. Thomas accepts the challenge, but Sloane is able to defeat him. Po calls for more challengers, and the other two remaining fighters step forward. One after the other, Sloane proves to be more than a match for them. In frustration, Po orders Laurence to fight him, but she refuses, calling him a coward. Po threatens to kill them all if she does not fight, but Laurence asserts her belief that there was never any prize money and that Po intends to kill them all regardless, her words prompting the other fighters to rally against him. As one, the men rise up to fight for their lives against Po's armed guards. 

The fighters seem to have a strong advantage, until Po himself enters the fray and begins to subdue them. Though he fights bravely, Lando is easily bested by the [[Muay Thai]] master. In the end, only Sloane and Po are left standing. After a brutal confrontation, Sloane conquers his rival once again, but Bill takes Vicky at gunpoint giving Po the opportunity to escape. Sloane dispatches Bill with a well-aimed knife throw before he and Vicky exit the compound along with Lando and Laurence.

'''Louis William "Bill" Conradt Jr.''' (January 30, 1950 – November 5, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockwallheraldbanner.com/obituaries/local_story_312160357.html|title=Rockwall Herald Banner - Obituaries|website=www.rockwallheraldbanner.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an assistant [[district attorney]] from [[Texas]]. He was inextricably linked to ''[[Dateline NBC]]'s'' ''[[To Catch a Predator]]'', a [[TV series]] that conducted [[sting operation]]s against suspected [[sexual predator]]s who target children online. Local law enforcement conducted a sting operation that identified Conradt as a suspect, and ''Dateline'' cameras recorded the events that followed. Conradt fatally shot himself upon encountering [[SWAT]] team members that were serving an arrest warrant at his home.

== Personal life and career ==
Louis Conradt was born January 30, 1950, in [[Terrell, Texas]]. Conradt graduated from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and received his [[law degree]] at [[Texas Tech University School of Law]]. He was the [[Kaufman County, Texas|Kaufman County]], [[Texas]], [[district attorney]] for more than two decades before giving up his seat to make a failed run in 2002 to be the 86th State District Judge. Afterward, he became [[Rockwall County, Texas|Rockwall County]]'s chief felony assistant district attorney. Conradt lived in Terrell, about an hour southeast of [[Murphy, Texas|Murphy]], where [[Perverted-Justice]], working in conjunction with ''Dateline'', had set up shop to conduct its predator stings. Records show that Conradt was single and lived alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/110606dnMetSexSting.bdd2321.html Profile], dallasnews.com; accessed July 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alleged interactions with Perverted-Justice ==
According to Perverted-Justice's logs, Conradt, posing as a 19-year-old university student, engaged in sexually charged [[online chat]]s with a person using the alias of a fictional 13-year-old named Luke.&lt;ref name="PJlogs1" /&gt; Conradt solicited pictures of "Luke's" [[penis]] and sent him photos purporting to be of himself.&lt;ref name=Esquire1 /&gt; After two weeks of these exchanges Perverted-Justice and NBC brought in an actor to play Luke over the phone. For reasons that are still not known, Conradt stopped responding to phone calls and [[Instant messaging|instant messages]]. It was then that police decided to bring the operation to Conradt's home in Terrell.

===Conradt's alleged MySpace page===
According to Perverted-Justice members, content from Conradt's [[Myspace|MySpace]] page began to disappear, leading them to believe that Conradt was covering up his tracks. This played a part in the decision of the authorities to pursue a warrant for Conradt's arrest. [[Chris Hansen]] mentioned the disappearing page on his blog and on air.&lt;ref name=InsideDateline&gt;[http://insidedateline.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/02/20/61856.aspx Louis Conradt profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809102536/http://insidedateline.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/02/20/61856.aspx |date=2007-08-09 }}, insidedateline.msnbc.msn.com; February 20, 2007; accessed July 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Esquire magazine|Esquire]]'' writer Luke Dittrich implies that the disappearing page pushed the participants to make an imminent move as, under Texas law, individuals may be charged with committing a crime if they participate in sexually explicit chats with persons identifying themselves as children.&lt;ref name=Esquire1 /&gt; Later investigation by ''Esquire'' revealed that Conradt's page had not been touched for months before the sting. Perverted-Justice members claimed that Conradt had other MySpace pages but never produced the evidence to prove the allegation. Hansen later admitted to ''Esquire'' that he did not remember actually seeing the page.&lt;ref name="Esquire2"&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/features/hansen-transcript Esquire Magazine "Interview with Chris Hansen: The Transcript" - Part two of a three-part report on the Conradt incident], esquire.com; accessed July 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal maneuverings ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}

According to the ''Esquire'' article, members from Perverted-Justice faxed the Collin County District Attorney's office requesting support for an upcoming sting. District attorney John Roach was surprised the request came from a civilian group rather than the police. Roach told ''Esquire'' he warned Murphy Police Chief Myrick to not deal with ''Dateline'' or Perverted-Justice and that the DA's office "will take no part in the planning or execution of the sting operation". Conradt's sister, Patricia, represented by attorney Bruce Baron, filed a federal lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Sting ===
The official participants in the sting included Murphy police and the Terrell Police Department, including Terrell's SWAT team.&lt;ref name=Esquire1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/predator0907|title=Tonight on Dateline This Man Will Die|date=11 February 2009|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to raw footage obtained by ''Esquire'', at least one ''Dateline'' cameraman had hidden himself near the Conradt residence door. Chris Hansen and ''Dateline'' denied that crew members were on the private property (such an act is illegal). 

Also in that footage is Frag, a member of Perverted-Justice, who is seen advising police on what to do next.&lt;ref name="Esquire1" /&gt; Chris Hansen denied that Perverted-Justice was present but recanted when ''Esquire'' was able to describe what Frag looked like.&lt;ref name="Esquire1" /&gt;

The warrants were signed shortly after 2 p.m.&lt;ref name=Esquire3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/conradt-warrant|title=The Search Warrant for Bill Conradt's House|date=19 July 2007|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, police and ''Dateline'' had been on the scene for hours.&lt;ref name=Esquire1 /&gt; In fact, ''Dateline'' had shown up as long as five hours earlier, and later records showed that neighbors had phoned in suspicious persons reports.&lt;ref name=Esquire1 /&gt;

According to the ''Esquire'' account (again, contested by ''Dateline'') ''Dateline'' crewmembers notified police that they observed that a Sunday newspaper on Conradt's doorstep had disappeared, indicating that Conradt was actually home.&lt;ref name=Esquire1 /&gt; Later, in an interview with ''Esquire'', Hansen would claim that he did not remember the incident, nor would he characterize anything ''Dateline'' did as surveillance for the police.

Using the tip given to them by ''Dateline'', the police made a decision to call in a SWAT team and perform a tactical entry. They feared that Conradt was aware of their presence and was now destroying evidence. The police broke the door's lock and swept through the house. They encountered Conradt in a hallway. According to the officers' account, Conradt said a variation of "I'm not going to hurt anyone". He then shot himself in the head with a [[Browning Arms Company|Browning]] [[.380]] [[FN Model 1910|handgun]].&lt;ref name=Esquire1 /&gt;

=== Events and reaction ===
In most cases, ''To Catch a Predator'' lured suspected [[Sex and the law|sex offenders]] with an actor or actress pretending to be a child, into a home that was wired with cameras and surrounded by police.

Conradt's death prompted increased criticism of the show, which was already being criticized by some, in the legal and journalistic profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2006/03/28/publiceye/entry1445230.shtml|title=More Criticism For "To Catch A Predator"|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year after the incident, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' published articles denouncing ''To Catch a Predator''. ''Esquire'' obtained raw footage of the incident that contradicted ''Dateline''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s and host [[Chris Hansen]]'s previous denials of the show's alleged collusion with law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name=Esquire1 /&gt;

Hansen did not respond to the ''Esquire'' article when ''[[Houston Chronicle|The Houston Chronicle]]'' asked for comment&lt;ref name=Chron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/5048069.html|title=Chron story|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but deferred to his spokeswoman, who called the idea that Hansen would dictate police action "preposterous".

Perverted-Justice founder Xavier von Erck called the ''Esquire'' article fiction.&lt;ref name="Chron" /&gt; He did not respond to the ''Esquire'' story's allegation or supporting evidence that ''Dateline'' and Perverted-Justice directed police actions in the Conradt case; rather, he reiterated his disgust for Conradt's behavior. In an email response to ''The Houston Chronicle'', he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The idea that anything led to the suicide of Conradt other than his want to avoid potential penalties for soliciting a 13-year-old boy sexually is outlandish. We encourage all interested to read the Conradt chat-logs and verification call recordings. Once you do that, you then immediately know why Conradt shot himself rather than face the criminal justice system.''&lt;ref name=PJlogs1&gt;[http://perverted-justice.com/?archive=Inxs00 Perverted-Justice logs]; accessed July 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Aftermath ===
Facts from the aired February 20, 2007, episode of ''To Catch a Predator'' were used as part of a $100 million lawsuit by Conradt's sister, Patricia Conradt, against [[NBC Universal]].&lt;ref name="NYLawJournal"&gt;[[New York Law Journal]] (March 3, 2008) [http://quest.law.com/Search/Search.do?Ntt=Suit+Proceeds+Against+NBC+Over+%27Dateline%27+Suicide&amp;Nty=1&amp;N=8359&amp;Ntk=SI_All&amp;cx=0&amp;sortVar=1&amp;x=6&amp;y=10 "Suit Proceeds Against NBC Over Dateline Suicide; Jury Could Find Responsible Journalism Line Crossed"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602005721/http://quest.law.com/Search/Search.do?Ntt=Suit+Proceeds+Against+NBC+Over+%27Dateline%27+Suicide&amp;Nty=1&amp;N=8359&amp;Ntk=SI_All&amp;cx=0&amp;sortVar=1&amp;x=6&amp;y=10 |date=2008-06-02 }}, Decision of Interest.

[[ABC News]] later did an investigation of the incident on its own news show, ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' (see ''[[To Catch a Predator#Investigation by 20/20|To Catch a Predator]]'' for more information).&lt;ref name=ABC2020&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i03f98739a9d2524fd9a85d8d973e1734 ABC's ''20/20'' report on ''Dateline''], hollywoodreporter.com; accessed July 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, 2008, the lawsuit brought against NBC Universal by Patricia Conradt was "amicably resolved" out of court.&lt;ref name=LATIMES1&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2008/06/nbc-resolves-la.html Patricia Conradt lawsuit against NBC settled "amicably"], latimesblogs.latimes.com; accessed July 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mother May I?''' is a [[children's game]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.education.com/activity/article/mother/&lt;/ref&gt; also known as "'''Captain May I?'''" and "'''Father May I?'''".

==Objective, rules, and general gameplay==
One player plays the "mother",  "father" or "captain". The other players are the "children" or "crewmembers".  To begin the game, the mother or father stands at one end of a room and turns around facing away, while all the children line up at the other end.  The children take turns asking "Mother/Father, may I ____?" and makes a movement suggestion.&lt;ref name="care.com"&gt;https://www.care.com/c/stories/3800/4-mother-may-i-game-alternatives/&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, one might ask, "Mother/Father, may I take five steps forward?"  The mother/father either replies "Yes, you may" or "No, you may not do that, but you may _____ instead" and inserts his/her own suggestion.  The players usually move closer to the mother/father but are sometimes led farther away. Even if the mother/father makes an unfavorable suggestion, the child must still perform it. The first of the children to reach the location of the mother/father wins the game. That child then becomes the mother/father himself, the original mother/father becomes a child, and a new round begins.

Some suggestions that fill in the "Mother/Father/Captain, may I ____?" blank include:
* Take (#) steps forward
* Take (#) giant steps forward (usually a small number, due to large step size)
* Take (#) baby steps forward (usually a large number, due to tiny step size)
* Take (#) umbrella steps forward
* Hop forward like a frog, (#) times
* Run forward for (#) seconds
* Crabwalk forward for (#) seconds
* Take (#) Cinderella steps - Twirl forward with index finger touching the top of the head
* Open-and-shut the book (#) times - jump forwards with feet apart then again bringing the feet together
* Lamppost - lie face down and stretch arms forwards, bring your feet to the point reached by the fingertips

If the "children" are reaching the "mother" or "father" too quickly, the "mother"/"father" may reject the child's suggestion by replacing it with "No, you may not do that, but you may ____ instead." They may reduce the child's original suggestion (for example, reducing five giant steps to three giant steps), or make a different suggestion, such as:
* Take (#) steps backward
* Run backward for (#) seconds
* Walk backward until I (mother/father) say "stop"
* Return to the starting line (in rare cases)

A common alternative gameplay is for "mother" or "father" (who can be facing the children) to begin each child's turn by issuing the instruction to be carried out. The child must reply, "Mother/Father, may I?" before carrying out the order, to which Mother/Father always consents. However, if the child omits to ask permission he or she is required to go back to the start. Children who have advanced a long way towards the goal are thus brought to ruin; instructions to go backwards must also be asked for lest a worse fate awaits. The art to being a good mother or father is to bring everyone as equally as possible.

Other variations of this kind of crossing-over game are "What's the Time, Mr Wolf?" (sometimes called "Old Mrs. Fox, What Time is It?", although this version is slightly different), "Grandmother's Footsteps" and "Bulldog", played in Britain. In the first of these, gameplay is similar: Mr Wolf faces away from the children (or Mrs. Fox faces the children), the children together chant in a well-known fashion "What's the time, Mr Wolf?" (or "Old Mrs. Fox, what time is it?"), and if he or she replies with 9 o'clock, the children move 9 steps forward. Should anyone reach Mr Wolf, he or she becomes the new Mr Wolf. Alternatively, however, should Mr Wolf reply to the question by saying "Dinner Time!" (or in the Mrs. Fox version, "Midnight!") he turns and chases the children back towards the start. If he catches one before he or she reaches safety, that child is the new Mr Wolf.

A '''Production Assistant''', also known as a '''PA''',  is a member of the [[film crew]] and is a job title used in [[filmmaking]] and [[television]] for a person responsible for various aspects of a [[Filmmaking#Production|production]].  The job of a PA can vary greatly depending on the budget and specific requirements of a production as well as whether the production is [[trade union|unionized]].

Production Assistants on films are sometimes attached to individual [[actor]]s or [[filmmaker]]s.

==Tasks==
In the [[United States]], Production Assistants in union and non-union workplaces face various tasks on the movie set of a [[filmmaking]] project. Most union PAs are asked to complete tasks with a certain focus. Union PAs only are asked to do a few tasks that may be related to one another and they normally receive tasks concentrated on the actual making of the movie. For example, union Production Assistants may be asked to evaluate a movie's daily rushes for a [[film director]] or help the [[film editor]] decipher ways to alter a scene. Those who are non-union Production Assistants are usually asked to complete a variety of tasks by a department head on a film set. The tasks of a non-union PA can match those of a union PA. These tasks asked to be completed by either a union or non-union PA are requirements that are related to the movie's production, such as setting up props on set and negotiating with the director on how a scene should be shot. However, non-union PAs commonly may be asked to complete a wider array of tasks since these tasks may not necessarily be associated with the film. For example, non-union PAs may be asked to input data in a computer, wash dishes, sort letters in the mail room, and buy coffee for department heads. Basic duties of non-union PAs can be classified as running errands for any person in the production department.&lt;ref&gt;{{production assistant; PA. (2014). In R. W. Kroon, A/V a to z: An encyclopedic dictionary of media, entertainment and other Audiovisual terms. Jefferson, NC: McFarland. Retrieved from http://libproxy.sfc.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/mcfav/production_assistant_pa/0?institutionId=5266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most PAs work with many people since their job requires them to complete generic obligations. Therefore, PAs must be proficient with their communication skills. Traditionally, PAs communicate with department heads by [[walkie-talkies]] on and around the films set. However, PAs can be asked by any member of the film crew to complete a job via interpersonal communication (talking to each other in person) or across technological devices such as a [[cell phone]]. Aspiring PAs must also expect to be attentive on set since they may be asked to complete any job for anyone at any time through any medium of communication. Former Production Assistant Caleb Clark recommends that people who want to be PAs must avoid sitting down, remaining alert at all times. Clark elucidates that PAs must be vigilant because they could be asked for help by any other person at any time of the day. In addition to their improving their skills pertaining to communication and readiness, PAs must adapt to their film set environment. Many movie sets that Production Assistants work on may vary in terms of luxuries. Since movie sets are given different amounts of amenities, not all of them may have the properties and resources that a Production Assistant will need to complete certain assignments. Therefore, PAs should be able to familiarize themselves with the movie set in order to increase their success rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Caleb|title=The Production Assistant's Pocket Handbook|url=https://mnfilmtv.org/files/2914/2428/3783/Production_Assistants_Pocket_Handbook.pdf|publisher=Inkslinger Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAs also must be aware that they may need to bring their own form of transportation on the set. Due to the little resources some sets may have, PAs should consider bringing their own cars or trucks to the set so that more of their long-distance tasks can be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griesinger|first1=Justin|title=Movie Crew Job Titles|url=http://filmincolorado.com/resources/job-descriptions/|website=Film In Colorado|publisher=Film In Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people that normally ask PAs for help are usually superior to them within the film crew. Those that ask a Production Assistant for help typically include people at the top of the film crew's structure, such as the [[production coordinator]], [[screenwriter]], producer, and especially the film's director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Caleb|title=The Production Assistant's Pocket Handbook|url=https://mnfilmtv.org/files/2914/2428/3783/Production_Assistants_Pocket_Handbook.pdf|publisher=Inkslinger Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television and feature film==
In unionized [[television]] and [[feature film]], production assistants are usually divided into different categories: "Set PA", "Truck PA", "Locations PA", "Office PA", or "Set Runner"  and "Extra PA or Daily" - Variations exist depending on a show's structure or region of the United States or Canada.

''Office PAs'' usually spend most hours in the respective show's production office handling such tasks as phones, deliveries, script copies, lunch pick-ups, and related tasks in coordination with the [[production manager]] and [[production coordinator]].

''Set PAs'' work on the physical set of the production, whether on location or on a sound stage. They report to the [[assistant director]] (AD) department and key set PA if one is so designated. Duties include echoing (calling out) "rolls" and "cuts", locking up (making sure nothing interferes with a take), wrangling talent (actors) and background, facilitating communication between departments, distributing paperwork and radios, and related tasks as mandated by the ADs. Set PAs usually work 12- to 16-hour days with the possibility at the end of a shoot to work more than 20 hours a single day and are regularly the "first to arrive and the last to leave".

==Commercials==
Commercial Set PAs share the same responsibilities as their Television and Feature Film counterparts (see "Set PAs" above), but also inherit additional responsibilities traditionally encompassed by other departments in the television and feature film structure. These responsibilities range from providing both critical and mundane production support equipment such as dollies, cranes, director's chairs and pop-up tents to standing in for talent and even filling in for other departments who might be shortstaffed.  It is not atypical for a commercial set PA to be seen handling trash one minute, and the next minute assisting the electricians or grips with a set-up. A select group of commercial set PAs are given the responsibility of driving and managing the production and camera cube trucks. This responsibility is often given to the more senior PAs because it provides several extra days of pay.

Set PAs in commercials are more commonly hired by the production coordinator and/or production manager as opposed to an AD or key set PA. However, many commercial ADs will.

Standard rate for a commercial PA in the Los Angeles area is a flat rate of [[United States dollar|$]]200 per day. On February 1, 2008, benefits for qualifying freelance PAs became available through the Producer's Health Benefits Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phbp.org/ Producer's Health Benefits Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Union vs. non-union==
In [[North America]], no union currently exists for production assistants, but the affiliation of a production with a union (or ''unions'') can affect the job responsibilities of a PA. Less unionized film productions have more positions that can be serviced by non-union personnel; consequently, PAs on such productions may take on a greater variety of non-traditional duties. Examples of this would be a PA setting a light bounce ([[grip (job)|grip]] department) or driving a passenger van ([[teamster]]/transportation department). PAs on a union production generally have less variety in their job duties whereas a non-union PA can be asked to perform any kind of task by a department head.&lt;ref&gt;{{production assistant; PA. (2014). In R. W. Kroon, A/V a to z: An encyclopedic dictionary of media, entertainment and other Audiovisual terms. Jefferson, NC: McFarland. Retrieved from http://libproxy.sfc.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/mcfav/production_assistant_pa/0?institutionId=5266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[British Columbia]], which has the third largest film and television production sector in North America, PAs are represented by the Director's Guild of Canada. Production Assistants represented by the DGC work in the Locations Department and work both on and off set with duties including locking up the set, traffic control, echoing rolls, firewatching, and liaising with the public and location owners. The Key-PA is in charge of all the PAs and is the 1st ADs' right-hand man when it comes to do with the on set aspects regarding a location. From this position DGC PA's can move up through the Locations Department or the Assistant Direction (AD) Department as either a Training Locations Manager (TAL) or a Training Assistant Director (TAD), respectively. Office Production Assistants work in the production office as an Office PA and they work for the Production Manager, Production Coordinator, Assistant Production Coordinator, and / or other office staff in maintaining the work-flow in the office. From this position, Office PAs can work their way up through the office by becoming an Assistant Production Coordinator (APOC), which is unionized under IATSE 891. Pay for PAs according to the DGC Collective Agreement in BC is [[Canadian dollar|$]]205.00 (non-members) to $215.00 (members) for a 15-hour day. An 8-hour day is approximately $118.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dgcbc.com/ie4/files/Minimum_Wage_Joint_Comm_Nov_2011_with_rate_sheet.pdf|date=October 21, 2011|publisher=[[Director's Guild of Canada]]|title=British Columbia Minimum Wage increase|archivedate=April 24, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424192605/http://www.dgcbc.com/ie4/files/Minimum_Wage_Joint_Comm_Nov_2011_with_rate_sheet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Quebec]], the Set PA is part of what is called the "Unit Department" or "Régie". Usually, there is a Unit Manager, Assistant Unit Manager, Set PA, Truck PA, Set Runner, and the "dailies" as needed for street blocking and extra set ups. In other states and provinces these duties are often taken care of by the AD Department, Locations or Transport. The Unit Manager and his/her team are the ones who deal with the daily logistics of shooting on location and/or in studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Online|first1=Maria|url=http://www.maria-online.com/information/article.php?lg=en&amp;q=Production_assistant|website=Maria-Online|publisher=Maria-Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two film unions in Quebec: [http://www.iatse514.net/ IATSE 514] and [http://www.aqtis.qc.ca/ AQTIS: L’Alliance québécoise des techniciens de l’image et du son].  In both cases the PA's are unionized.

== Publication ==
Production assistants are also present in fields other than film and television, as publication businesses also have a need for PAs to regulate the production process of making professional written pieces such as articles, books, records or any other kind of production involving the preparation of written words.

=== Educational and publishing companies ===
The tasks taken on by a PA will depend on the type of educational and/or publishing company that employs them. If the assistant works at a textbook or publishing company, they may oversee the art and composition of written works. P.A.s at educational companies may also oversee work in proofreading departments, as well as for freelance copy editors and authors. When looking at documents and other materials uploaded by the author the production assistant has to make sure everything falls within the requirements of the company they work for. This includes items such as the format, correct file types, positioning, captions and obtaining copyright forms from authors.

If the assistant is part of a publications department for a scientific or professional organization, they have daily jobs that which involve keeping records that are important for their company. They may take care of editing, sending or reading information in databases or manuscripts. Production assistants may also team up with Information Technology workers to help streamline the tasks of the publications departments since it involves keeping track of large amounts of data and information. Working with an I.T. department to create a specific sorting program can improve the speed at which documents are proofed and organized.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas-Medwid, Rachel S. "Lauren Foster." Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, vol. 89, no. 10, Oct. 2008, pp. 1592-1593. EBSCOhost&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entertainment Companies ===
In entertainment companies, production assignments may have to do technical work such as typesetting, printing and binding. They must also be good communicators and be good with deadlines. When working for magazines or newspapers, production assistants may need to keep track of things like individual teams and the cost of producing a physical product. Clients and stakeholders may be involved in a magazine, so P.A.'s have to be professional. There may also be journalists who are on deadlines or need extensions. There are also creative processes that a production assistant can be involved with. They can work with book designers or magazines to ensure a client's specifications are followed properly and may then have to send a copy of the draft for approval to clients. This can last until the final piece has been completed. When printing a piece of work, production assistants may deal with is how files are supposed to be submitted to printers, along with publication dates, and any printing or copy issues. Even after a final piece is complete, the PA may need to ask a client their thoughts on final product.&lt;ref&gt;“Types of Publishing Job.” ''The Society of Young Publishers'', The Publishers Association, thesyp.org.uk/types-of-publishing-job/.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Publishing''' is the [[dissemination]] of [[literature]], [[music]], or [[information]]—the activity of making information available to the general public. In some cases, authors may be their own publishers, meaning originators and developers of [[content (media and publishing)|content]] also provide [[media (communication)|media]] to deliver and display the content for the same. Also, the word publisher can refer to the individual who leads a publishing company or an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] or to a person who owns/heads a magazine.

Traditionally, the term refers to the distribution of printed works such as books (the "book trade") and [[newspaper]]s. With the advent of digital information systems and the [[Internet]], the scope of publishing has expanded to include electronic resources such as the electronic versions of books and periodicals, as well as [[micropublishing]], [[Electronic publishing|websites]], [[blog]]s, [[video game publisher]]s, and the like.

Publishing includes the following stages of development: acquisition, [[copy editing]], production, [[printing]] (and its [[Electronic publishing|electronic equivalents]]), [[marketing]] and [[distribution (business)|distribution]].

[[Publication]] is also important as a [[law|legal concept]]:
# As the process of giving formal notice to the world of a significant intention, for example, to [[marry]] or enter [[bankruptcy]];
# As the essential precondition of being able to claim [[defamation]]; that is, the alleged [[libel]] must have been published, and
# For [[copyright]] purposes, where there is a difference in the protection of [[Edition (book)|published]] and unpublished works.

There are two basic [[business model]]s in book publishing:
# Traditional or commercial publishers: Do not charge authors at all to publish their books, for certain rights to publish the work and paying a royalty on books sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steven|first1=Daniel|title=Self-publishing – In traditional royalty publishing|url=http://publishlawyer.com/publishing-faq/#Q_What_is_self-publishing|website=publishlawyer.com|publisher=Daniel N. Steven, LLC|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Self-publishing: The author has to meet the total expense to get the book published. The author should retain full rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steven|first1=Daniel|title=What is self-publishing|url=http://publishlawyer.com/publishing-faq/#Q_What_is_self-publishing|website=publishlawyer.com|publisher=Daniel N. Steven, LLC|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[Vanity press|vanity publishing]].

== History ==

Publishing became possible with the [[history of writing|invention of writing]], and became more practical upon the [[History of printing|introduction of printing]]. Prior to printing, distributed works were copied manually, by [[scribe]]s. Due to printing, publishing progressed hand-in-hand with the [[History of books|development of books]].

The Chinese inventor [[Bi Sheng]] made [[movable type]] of earthenware circa 1045, but there are no known surviving examples of his printing. Around 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]]. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce, and more widely available.

Early printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as [[incunable]]s or ''incunabula''. "A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in A.D. 330."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Clapham (industrialist)|Clapham, Michael]], "Printing" in ''A History of Technology'', Vol 2. ''From the Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution'', edd. Charles Singer ''et al.'' (Oxford 1957), p. 377. Cited from [[Elizabeth L. Eisenstein]], ''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change'' (Cambridge University, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, printing enabled other forms of publishing besides books. The [[History of newspaper publishing|history of modern newspaper publishing]] started in Germany in 1609, with [[magazine#History|publishing of magazines]] following in 1663.

Historically, publishing has been handled by [[#Publishing as a business|publishers]], with the history of [[self-publishing]] progressing slowly until the advent of computers brought us [[electronic publishing]], which has been made evermore ubiquitous from the moment the world went online with the [[Internet]]. The [[History of the World Wide Web|establishment of the World Wide Web]] in 1989 soon propelled the [[website]] into a dominant medium of publishing, as websites are easily created by almost anyone with Internet access. The [[history of wikis]] started shortly thereafter, followed closely by the [[history of blogging]].  Commercial publishing also progressed, as previously printed forms developed into online forms of publishing, distributing [[online book]]s, [[Online newspaper#History|online newspapers]], and [[online magazine]]s.

Since its start, the World Wide Web has been facilitating the [[technological convergence]] of commercial and self-published content, as well as the convergence of publishing and producing into [[Online producer|online production]] through the development of [[multimedia]] content.

==The process of publishing==
Book and magazine publishers spend a lot of their time buying or commissioning copy; newspaper publishers, by contrast, usually hire their staff to produce copy, although they may also employ freelance journalists, called [[Stringer (journalism)|stringers]]. At a small press, it is possible to survive by relying entirely on commissioned material. But as activity increases, the need for works may outstrip the publisher's established circle of writers.

For works written independently of the publisher, writers often first submit a query letter or proposal directly to a [[literary agent]] or to a publisher. Submissions sent directly to a publisher are referred to as unsolicited submissions, and the majority come from previously unpublished authors. If the publisher accepts unsolicited [[manuscript (publishing)|manuscripts]], then the manuscript is placed in the [[slush pile]], which [[publisher's reader]]s sift through to identify manuscripts of sufficient quality or revenue potential to be referred to acquisitions editors for review. The acquisitions editors send their choices to the editorial staff. The time and number of people involved in the process are dependent on the size of the publishing company, with larger companies having more degrees of assessment between unsolicited submission and publication. Unsolicited submissions have a very low rate of acceptance, with some sources estimating that publishers ultimately choose about three out of every ten thousand unsolicited manuscripts they receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| author=Tara K. Harper
| url=http://www.tarakharper.com/faq_pub.htm
| title = On Publishers and Getting Published
| year = 2004
|access-date= 28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many book publishers around the world maintain a strict "no unsolicited submissions" policy and will only accept submissions via a literary agent. This policy shifts the burden of assessing and developing writers out of the publisher and onto the literary agents. At these publishers, unsolicited manuscripts are thrown out, or sometimes returned, if the author has provided pre-paid postage.

Established authors may be represented by a [[literary agent]] to market their work to publishers and negotiate contracts. Literary agents take a percentage of author earnings (varying between 10 and 15 percent) to pay for their services.

Some writers follow a non-standard route to publication. For example, this may include bloggers who have attracted large readerships producing a book based on their websites, books based on [[Internet memes]], instant "celebrities" such as [[Joe the Plumber]], retiring sports figures and in general anyone a publisher feels could produce a marketable book. Such books often employ the services of a [[ghostwriter]].

For a submission to reach publication, it must be championed by an editor or publisher who must work to convince other staff of the need to publish a particular title. An editor who discovers or champions a book that subsequently becomes a best-seller may find their reputation enhanced as a result of their success.

===Acceptance and negotiation===
Once a work is accepted, [[commissioning editor]]s negotiate the purchase of [[intellectual property]] rights and agree on [[royalties|royalty]] rates.

The authors of traditional printed materials typically sell exclusive territorial intellectual property rights that match the list of countries in which distribution is proposed (i.e. the rights match the legal systems under which copyright protections can be enforced). In the case of books, the publisher and writer must also agree on the intended formats of publication —[[mass-market paperback]], "trade" [[paperback]] and [[hardback]] are the most common options.

The situation is slightly more complex if electronic formatting is to be used. Where distribution is to be by [[CD-ROM]] or other physical media, there is no reason to treat this form differently from a paper format, and national copyright is an acceptable approach. But the possibility of Internet download without the ability to restrict physical distribution within national boundaries presents legal problems that are usually solved by selling language or translation rights rather than national rights. Thus, Internet access across the [[European Union]] is relatively open because of the laws forbidding discrimination based on nationality, but the fact of publication in, say, France, limits the target market to those who read [[French language|French]].

Having agreed on the scope of the publication and the formats, the parties in a book agreement must then agree on [[royalty rate]]s, the percentage of the gross retail price that will be paid to the author, and the [[advance payment]]. The publisher must estimate the potential sales in each market and balance projected revenue against production costs. Royalties usually range between 10–12% of recommended retail price. An advance is usually 1/3 of the first print run total royalties. For example, if a book has a print run of 5000 copies and will be sold at $14.95 and the author is to receive 10% royalties, the total sum payable to the author if all copies are sold is $7475 (10% x $14.95 x 5000). The advance in this instance would roughly be $2490. Advances vary greatly between books, with established authors commanding larger advances.

===Pre-production stages===
Although listed as distinct stages, parts of these occur concurrently. As editing of text progresses, front cover design and initial layout takes place, and sales and marketing of the book begins.

====Editorial stage====
A decision is taken to publish a work, and the technical legal issues resolved, the author may be asked to improve the quality of the work through rewriting or smaller changes and the staff will [[editing|edit]] the work. Publishers may maintain a [[Style guide|house style]], and staff will [[copy edit]] to ensure that the work matches the style and grammatical requirements of each market. Editors often choose or refine titles and headlines. Editing may also involve structural changes and requests for more information. Some publishers employ [[fact checker]]s, particularly regarding non-fiction works.

====Design stage====
When a final text is agreed upon, the next phase is [[design]]. This may include [[Visual arts|artwork]] being commissioned or confirmation of layout. In publishing, the word "art" also indicates photographs. Depending on the number of photographs required by the work, photographs may also be licensed from [[Stock photography|photo libraries]]. For those works that are particularly rich in illustrations, the publisher may contract a picture researcher to find and license the photographs required for the work. The design process prepares the work for [[printing]] through processes such as [[typesetting]], dust jacket composition, specification of paper quality, binding method and casing.

The type of book being produced determines the amount of design required. For standard fiction titles, the design is usually restricted to typography and cover design. For books containing illustrations or images, design takes on a much larger role in laying out how the page looks, how chapters begin and end, colours, typography, cover design and ancillary materials such as posters, catalogue images, and other sales materials. Non-fiction illustrated titles are the most design intensive books, requiring extensive use of images and illustrations, captions, typography and a deep involvement and consideration of the reader experience.

The activities of typesetting, page layout, the production of negatives, plates from the negatives and, for hardbacks, the preparation of brasses for the spine legend and [[Imprint (bibliography)|Imprint]] are now all computerized. Prepress computerization evolved mainly in about the last twenty years of the 20th century. If the work is to be distributed electronically, the final files are saved in formats appropriate to the target operating systems of the hardware used for reading. These may include [[PDF]] files.

====Sales and marketing stage====
The sales and marketing stage is closely intertwined with the editorial process. As front cover images are produced, or chapters are edited, sales people may start talking about the book with their customers to build early interest. Publishing companies often produce advanced information sheets that may be sent to customers or overseas publishers to gauge possible sales. As early interest is measured, this information feeds back through the editorial process and may affect the formatting of the book and the strategy employed to sell it. For example, if interest from foreign publishers is high, co-publishing deals may be established whereby publishers share printing costs in producing large print runs thereby lowering the per-unit cost of the books. Conversely, if initial feedback is not strong, the print-run of the book may be reduced, the marketing budget cut or, in some cases, the book is dropped from publication altogether.

===Printing===
After the end of editing and design work, the printing phase begins. The first step involves the production of a [[pre-press proof]], which the printers send for final checking and sign-off by the publisher. This proof shows the book precisely as it will appear once printed and represents the final opportunity for the publisher to find and correct any errors. Some printing companies use electronic proofs rather than printed proofs. Once the publisher has approved the proofs, printing – the physical production of the printed work – begins.

Recently new printing process have emerged, such as [[printing on demand]] (POD) and [[web-to-print]]. The book is written, edited, and designed as usual, but it is not printed until the publisher receives an order for the book from a customer. This procedure ensures low costs for storage and reduces the likelihood of printing more books than will be sold. Web-to-print enables a more streamlined way of connecting customers to printing through an online medium.

===Binding===
{{Main| Bibliopegy}}

In the case of books, binding follows upon the printing process. It involves folding the printed sheets, "securing them together, affixing boards or sides to it, and covering the whole with leather or other materials".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution===
The final stage in publication involves making the product available to the public, usually by offering it for sale. In previous centuries, authors frequently also acted as their own editor, printer, and bookseller, but these functions have become separated. Once a book, newspaper, or another publication is printed, the publisher may use a variety of channels to distribute it. Books are most commonly sold through [[bookselling|booksellers]] and through other retailers. Newspapers and magazines are typically sold in advance directly by the publisher to [[subscriber]]s, and then distributed either through the postal system or by [[newspaper carrier]]s. Periodicals are also frequently sold through [[newsagent]]s and vending machines.

Within the book industry, printers often fly some copies of the finished book to publishers as sample copies to aid sales or to be sent out for pre-release reviews. The remaining books often travel from the printing facility via sea freight. Accordingly, the delay between the approval of the pre-press proof and the arrival of books in a warehouse, much less in a retail store, can take some months. For books that tie into movie release-dates (particularly for [[children's films]]), publishers will arrange books to arrive in store up to two months prior to the movie release to build interest in the movie.

==Publishing as a business==
[[File:ChungyoEslite fullsize.png|thumb|[[Eslite Bookstore]] in [[Taiwan]].]]

Derided in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] as "a purely commercial affair" that cared more about profits than about literary quality,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; publishing is fundamentally a business, with a need for the expenses of creating, producing, and distributing a book or other publication not to exceed the income derived from its sale. Publishing is now a major industry with the largest companies [[Reed Elsevier]] and [[Pearson PLC]] having global publishing operations.

The publisher usually controls the [[advertising]] and other [[marketing]] tasks, but may [[subcontract]] various aspects of the process to specialist publisher marketing agencies. In many companies, editing, proofreading, layout, design, and other aspects of the production process are done by [[freelancer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jobs and Careers – Help|publisher=Random House, Inc.|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/about/faq/index.php?ToDo=view&amp;questId=144&amp;catId=11|accessdate=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jobs with Penguin|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd|url=http://gs12.globalsuccessor.com/fe/tpl_penguin01.asp?newms=info03#para2|accessdate=13 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906215646/http://gs12.globalsuccessor.com/fe/tpl_penguin01.asp?newms=info03#para2|archivedate=6 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dedicated in-house salespeople are sometimes replaced by companies who specialize in sales to bookshops, wholesalers, and chain stores for a fee. This trend is accelerating as retail book chains and supermarkets have centralized their buying.

If the entire process up to the stage of printing is handled by an outside company or individuals, and then sold to the publishing company, it is known as ''[[book packaging]]''. This is a common strategy between smaller publishers in different territorial markets where the company that first buys the intellectual property rights then sells a package to other publishers and gains an immediate return on capital invested. The first publisher will often print sufficient copies for all markets and thereby get the maximum quantity efficiency on the print run for all.

Some businesses maximize their profit margins through [[vertical integration]]; book publishing is not one of them. Although newspaper and magazine companies still often own printing presses and binderies, book publishers rarely do. Similarly, the trade usually sells the finished products through a [[distribution (business)|distributor]] who stores and distributes the publisher's wares for a percentage fee or sells on a sale or return basis.

The advent of the Internet has provided the electronic way of book distribution without the need of physical printing, physical delivery and storage of books. This, therefore, poses an interesting question that challenges publishers, distributors, and retailers. The question pertains to the role and importance the publishing houses have in the overall publishing process. It is a common practice that the author, the original creator of the work, signs the contract awarding him or her only around 10% of the proceeds of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexbooks.net/publishingcontract.htm |title=Sample Publishing Contract |publisher=Indexbooks.net |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such contract leaves 90% of the book proceeds to the publishing houses, distribution companies, marketers, and retailers. One example (rearranged) of the distribution of proceeds from the sale of a book was given as follows:&lt;ref name="ireaderreview.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ireaderreview.com/2009/05/03/book-cost-analysis-cost-of-physical-book-publishing/|title=Book Cost Analysis – Cost of Physical Book Publishing - Kindle Review – Kindle Phone Review, Kindle Fire HD Review|work=Kindle Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 45% to the retailer
* 10% to the wholesaler
* 10.125% to the publisher for printing (this is usually subcontracted out)
* 7.15% to the publisher for marketing
* 12.7% to the publisher for pre-production
* 15% to the author (royalties)

There is a common misconception that publishing houses make large profits and that authors are the lowest paid in the publishing chain. However, most publishers make little profit from individual titles, with 75% of books not breaking even. Approximately 80% of the cost of a book is taken up by the expenses of preparing, distributing, and printing (with printing being one of the lowest costs of all).  On successful titles, publishing companies will usually make around 10% profit, with the author(s) receiving 8–15% of the retail price. However, given that authors are usually individuals, are often paid advances irrespective of whether the book turns a profit and do not normally have to split profits with others, it makes them the highest paid individuals in the publishing process.

Within the electronic book path, the publishing house's role remains almost identical.  The process of preparing a book for e-book publication is exactly the same as print publication, with only minor variations in the process to account for the different mediums of publishing.  While some costs, such as the discount given to retailers (normally around 45%)&lt;ref name="ireaderreview.com"/&gt; are eliminated, additional costs connected to ebooks apply (especially in the conversion process), raising the production costs to a similar level.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Print on demand]] is rapidly becoming an established alternative to traditional publishing.  In 2005, [[Amazon.com]] announced its purchase of Booksurge and selfsanepublishing, a major "print on demand" operation.  CreateSpace is the Amazon subsidiary that facilitates publishing by small presses and individual authors. Books published via CreateSpace are sold on Amazon and other outlets, with Amazon extracting a very high percentage of the sales proceeds for the services of publishing. printing and distributing. One of the largest bookseller chains, Barnes &amp; Noble, already runs its successful imprint with both new titles and classics — hardback editions of out-of-print former best sellers. Similarly, Ingram Industries, the parent company of Ingram Book Group (a leading US book wholesaler), now includes its print-on-demand division called Lightning Source. In 2013, Ingram launched a small press and self-publishing arm called Ingram Spark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.ingramspark.com/Portal|title=How to Publish a Book – eBook Publishing |work=ingramspark.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105052/https://www1.ingramspark.com/Portal|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payment terms are much closer to those of Amazon and less favorable than those they offer to more established publishers via Lightning Source. Among publishers, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] recently announced that it will start selling its backlist titles directly to consumers through its website.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Book clubs are almost entirely direct-to-retail, and niche publishers pursue a mixed strategy to sell through all available outlets — their output is insignificant to the major booksellers, so lost revenue poses no threat to the traditional symbiotic relationships between the four activities of printing, publishing, distribution, and retail.

==Industry sub-divisions==

===Newspaper publishing===
{{Main|Newspaper}}
Newspapers are regularly scheduled publications that present recent news, typically on a type of inexpensive paper called [[newsprint]]. Most newspapers are primarily sold to [[subscriber]]s, through retail newsstands or are distributed as advertising-supported [[free newspaper]]s. About one-third of publishers in the United States are newspaper publishers.&lt;ref name=DOL&gt;{{cite web | title = Career Guide to Industries, 2010–11 Edition:  Publishing, Except Software | url = http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm | publisher = U.S. Department of Labor | author = Bureau of Labor Statistics | date = 17 December 2009 | accessdate = 28 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Periodical publishing===
{{Main|Periodical publication}}
Nominally, periodical publishing involves publications that appear in a new edition on a regular schedule. Newspapers and magazines are both periodicals, but within the industry, the periodical publishing is frequently considered a separate branch that includes magazines and even [[academic journal]]s, but not newspapers.&lt;ref name=DOL /&gt;  About one-third of publishers in the United States publish periodicals (not including newspapers).&lt;ref name=DOL /&gt;

===Book publishing=== &lt;!-- [[Big Five (publishers)]] links here.  Please do not change. --&gt;
{{See also|History of books}}
{{Redirect|Book publishing company|the publisher named Book Publishing Company|The Farm (Tennessee)}}

The global book publishing industry accounts for over $100 billion of annual revenue, or about 15% of the total media industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=http://www.internationalpublishers.org/images/data-statistics/2012/ipa-global-publishing-statistics-2.pdf|author=IPA Global|title=Publishing Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Book publishers represent less than a sixth of the publishers in the United States.&lt;ref name=DOL /&gt; Most books are published by a small number of very large book publishers, but thousands of smaller book publishers exist. Many small- and medium-sized book publishers specialize in a specific area. Additionally, thousands of authors have created publishing companies and self-published their own works.

Within the book publishing, the '''publisher of record''' for a book is the entity in whose name the book's [[ISBN]] is registered. The publisher of record may or may not be the actual publisher.

Approximately 60%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/drm-lawsuit-independent-bookstores-amazon_n_2727519.html | work=Huffington Post |first=Andrew |last=Losowsky |title=Indie Bookstores File Lawsuit Against Amazon | date=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of English-language books are produced through the "Big Five" publishing houses: [[Penguin Random House]], [[Hachette Book Group USA|Hachette]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] and [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]. (See also: [[List of English-language book publishing companies]].)

===Directory publishing===
Directory publishing is a specialized genre within the publishing industry. These publishers produce mailing lists, [[telephone book]]s, and other types of directories.&lt;ref name=DOL /&gt; With the advent of the Internet, many of these directories are now online.

===Academic publishing===
{{Main|Academic publishing}}
Academic publishers are typically either book or periodical publishers that have specialized in academic subjects. Some, like [[university presses]], are owned by scholarly institutions. Others are commercial businesses that focus on academic subjects.

The development of the [[printing press]] represented a revolution for communicating the latest hypotheses and research results to the academic community and supplemented what a scholar could do personally. But this improvement in the [[communication efficiency|efficiency of communication]] created a challenge for libraries, which have had to accommodate the weight and volume of literature.

One of the key functions that academic publishers provide is to manage the process of [[peer review]]. Their role is to facilitate the impartial assessment of research and this vital role is not one that has yet been usurped, even with the advent of social networking and online document sharing.

Today, publishing academic journals and textbooks is a large part of an international industry. Critics claim that standardised accounting and profit-oriented policies have displaced the publishing ideal of providing access to all. In contrast to the commercial model, there is [[non-profit]] publishing, where the publishing organization is either organised specifically for the purpose of publishing, such as a [[university press]], or is one of the functions of an organisation such as a medical charity, founded to achieve specific practical goals. An alternative approach to the corporate model is [[Open access (publishing)|open access]], the online distribution of individual articles and academic journals without charge to readers and libraries. The pioneers of Open Access journals are [[BioMed Central]] and the Public Library of Science ([[PLoS]]). Many commercial publishers are experimenting with hybrid models where certain articles or government funded articles are made free due to authors' payment of processing charges, and other articles are available as part of a subscription or individual article purchase.

===Tie-in publishing===
{{Main|Tie-in}}
Technically, radio, television, cinemas, VCDs and DVDs, music systems, games, computer hardware and mobile telephony publish information to their audiences. Indeed, the marketing of a major film often includes a [[novelization]], a graphic novel or comic version, the soundtrack album, a game, model, toys and endless promotional publications.

Some of the major publishers have entire divisions devoted to a single franchise, e.g. Ballantine Del Rey Lucasbooks has the exclusive rights to ''Star Wars'' in the United States; Random House UK (Bertelsmann)/Century LucasBooks holds the same rights in the United Kingdom. The game industry self-publishes through BL Publishing/[[Black Library]] ([[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer]]) and Wizards of the Coast ([[Dragonlance]], [[Forgotten Realms]], etc.). The BBC has its publishing division that does very well with long-running series such as [[Doctor Who]]. These multimedia works are cross-marketed aggressively and sales frequently outperform the average stand-alone published work, making them a focus of corporate interest.&lt;ref name="cave"&gt;Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed.), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas", 1990, British Museum publications, {{ISBN|0714114472}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent publishing alternatives===
{{See also|Alternative media}}

Writers in a specialized field or with a narrower appeal have found smaller alternatives to the mass market in the form of [[small press]]es and [[self-publishing]]. More recently, these options include [[print on demand]] and [[ebook]] format. These publishing alternatives provide an avenue for authors who believe that mainstream publishing will not meet their needs or who are in a position to make more money from direct sales than they could from [[bookstore]] sales, such as popular speakers who sell books after speeches. Authors are more readily published by this means due to the much lower costs involved.

==Recent developments==
The 21st century has brought some new technological changes to the publishing industry. These changes include [[e-books]], [[print on demand]], and [[accessible publishing]]. E-books have been quickly growing in availability in major publishing markets such as the USA and the UK since 2005. [[Google]], [[Amazon.com]], and [[Sony]] have been leaders in working with publishers and libraries to digitize books. As of early 2011, Amazon's [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] reading device is a significant force in the market, along with the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPad]] and the [[Barnes &amp; Noble Nook|Nook]] from [[Barnes &amp; Noble]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Along with the growing popularity of e-books, some companies like [[Oyster (company)|Oyster]] and [[Scribd]] have pursued the subscription model, providing members unlimited access to a content library on a variety of digital reading devices.

The ability to quickly and cost-effectively print on demand has meant that publishers no longer have to store books at warehouses, if the book is in low or unknown demand. This is a huge advantage to small publishers who can now operate without large overheads and large publishers who can now cost-effectively sell their backlisted items.

[[Accessible publishing]] uses the digitization of books to mark up books into [[XML]] and then produces multiple formats from this to sell to consumers, often targeting those with difficulty reading. Formats include a variety larger print sizes, specialized print formats for [[dyslexia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/making-reading-easier/ |title=Making Reading Easier – Paper Cuts Blog |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=20 May 2008|author=Dwight Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt; eye tracking problems and [[macular degeneration]], as well as [[Braille]], [[DAISY]], [[audiobook]]s and [[e-books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readhowyouwant.com/Technology/overview.aspx |title=Overview of the Technology- Awards, Cost Savings|publisher=Radhowyouwant.com|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green publishing means adapting the publishing process to minimise environmental impact. One example of this is the concept of on-demand printing, using digital or print-on-demand technology. This cuts down the need to ship books since they are manufactured close to the customer on a just-in-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanter |first=James |url=http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/reading-green-on-demand/?scp=1&amp;sq=green%20publishing%20toby&amp;st=cse |title=Reading Green On Demand |publisher=Green blogs, ''New York Times'' |date=2 December 2008 |accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further development is the growth of on-line publishing where no physical books are produced. The ebook is created by the author and uploaded to a website from where it can be downloaded and read by anyone.

An increasing number of authors are using [[niche marketing]] online to sell more books by engaging with their readers online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Rinzler |title=The Magic of Niche Marketing for Authors |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/booked/2010/07/29/the-magic-of-niche-marketing-for-authors/ |work=[[Forbes]] |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=3 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors can use free services such as [[Smashwords]] or Amazon's [[CreateSpace]] to have their book available for worldwide sale.  There is an obvious attraction for first time authors who have been repeatedly rejected by the existing agent/publisher model to explore this opportunity. However, a consequence of this change in the mechanics of book distribution is that there is now no mandatory check on author skill or even their ability to spell, and any person with an internet connection can publish whatever they choose, regardless of the literary merit or even basic readability of their writing.

Publication is the distribution of copies or [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] to the [[General public|public]].&lt;ref name="bc"&gt;{{cite web|author=WIPO |url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html#P98_14701 |title=Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works |publisher=Wipo.int |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/copyrights/The%20Universal%20Copyright%20Convention%20_Geneva%20Text--September.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – The Universal Copyright Convention _Geneva Text—September |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121125161930/http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/copyrights/The%20Universal%20Copyright%20Convention%20_Geneva%20Text--September.pdf |archivedate=25 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] requires that this can only be done with the consent of the copyright holder, which is initially always the author.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;  In the [[Universal Copyright Convention]], "publication" is defined in article VI as "the reproduction in tangible form and the general distribution to the public of copies of a work from which it can be read or otherwise visually perceived."&lt;ref name="ucc"/&gt;

In providing a work to the general public, the publisher takes responsibility for the publication in a way that a mere printer or a shopkeeper does not. For example, publishers may face charges of [[defamation]], if they produce and distribute libelous material to the public, even if the libel was written by another person.

==Privishing==
'''Privishing''' (''priv''ate publ''ishing'')  is a modern term for publishing a book in such a small amount, or with such lack of marketing, advertising or sales support from the publisher, that the book effectively does not reach the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0711-05.htm |title=Journalists Thrown 'Into the Buzzsaw' |last=Winkler |first=David |date=11 July 2002 |publisher=CommonDreams.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804080018/http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0711-05.htm |archivedate=August 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, while nominally published, is almost impossible to obtain through normal channels such as bookshops, often cannot be special-ordered and will have a notable lack of support from its publisher, including refusals to reprint the title. A book that is privished may be referred to as "killed". Depending on the motivation, privishing may constitute [[breach of contract]], [[censorship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Louis Rodolphe Salis'''&lt;ref&gt;Named ''Constant Maximin Rodolphe Salis'' on his birth certificate dated {{date|30 May 1851 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{date|29 May 1851}} – {{date|20 March 1897}}) was the creator, host and owner of the [[Le Chat Noir]] ("The Black Cat") [[cabaret]] (known briefly in 1881 at its beginning as "Cabaret Artistique.") With this establishment Salis is remembered as the creator of the modern cabaret: a nightclub where the patrons could sit at tables with alcoholic drinks and enjoy variety acts on a stage, introduced by a master of ceremonies who interacted with the audience.

==Biography==
[[File:CHAT NOIR journal, number 152, 6 Decembre 1884.jpg|thumbnail|''CHAT NOIR'' journal, number 152, 6 Decembre 1884.]]

The son of a distiller in [[Châtellerault]], Salis came to Paris in 1872, after leaving the regiment in which he had undertaken military service. He moved into the [[Hotel de Rome]] on [[Rue de Seine]], in the [[Latin Quarter]].

He founded "L'école vibrante" (The Vibrant School), soon renamed the "L'école iriso-subversive de Chicago" (The Chicago Iriso-Subversive School)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpc86.info/depuis1964.php|title=SPECTACLES DU TPC DEPUIS 1964|work=tpc86.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to draw attention to his artistic group. In fact he was earning a living by making [[stations of the cross]] and other religious objects, that he and his friends painted.

"In fact, it [The School] had the overall intended, but not admitted, immediate aim of making a series of Stations of the Cross to sell at eight and fourteen francs each, in a shop selling religious articles in the Saint Sulpice. The very tedious work was divided between the four "students" according to their different natures. Rene Gilbert painted heads; Wagner hands; Antonio de La Gandara draperies; Salis, finally, backgrounds and landscapes ..."&lt;ref&gt;''The Song in Montmartre'', Michael Herbert, ed. The Round Table&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to combine art and alcoholic beverage, Salis had the idea of creating a café in "the purest style of Louis XII ... with a chandelier of wrought iron from the Byzantine period, and where the gentry, the burghers and peasants are now invited to drink absinthe after the usual manner of Victor Hugo and Garibaldi, and [[hypocras]] in golden bowls.&lt;ref&gt;''Absinthe. A Franco-Swiss fairy: fairy Franco-Swiss'', Noel Benedict, ed. Cabédita, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  In reality, the first tavern called The Black Cat ([[Le Chat Noir]]), opened in November 1881 in a two-room building at 84 Boulevard Rochechouart (a site now commemorated by a plaque), began by serving bad wine and with a rather inferior decor. But from the first, at the door, guests were greeted by a [[Swiss guard]], splendidly bedecked and covered with gold from head to foot, supposedly responsible for bringing in the painters and poets who arrived, while barring the "infamous priests and the military." Salis' tongue-in-cheek admirational piece was on a high marble fireplace: ''The skull of [[Louis XIII]] as a child''.&lt;ref&gt;''Paris, crossroads of arts and letters, 1880-1918'', Jacqueline Baldran, ed. L'Harmattan, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The first site's success was assured with the wholesale arrival of a group of radical young writers and artists called ''Les Hydropathes'' (“those who are afraid of water”), led by the journalist [[Emile Goudeau]]. The group claimed to be averse to water, preferring wine and beer. Goudeau’s club first met in his house on the [[Rive Gauche (Paris)|Rive Gauche]] (left bank), but had become so popular that it outgrew its meeting place. Salis, on meeting Goudeau, convinced him to transfer the club across the river [[Seine]] to 84 Boulevard Rochechouart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/chat-noir-montmartre-cabaret/|title=Le Chat Noir: Historic Montmartre Cabaret|author=Anna Meakin|work=Bonjour Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen - Tournée du Chat Noir de Rodolphe Salis (Tour of Rodolphe Salis' Chat Noir) - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|Now iconic [[Theophile-Alexandre Steinlen|Steinlen]]  poster advertising the approaching tour of The Black Cat show, 1896.]]
Le Chat Noir also soon outgrew its first site. On 10 June 1885, with great fanfare, Salis moved to new premises located 12 Rue Victor-Masse (which before 1885 had been Rue de Laval 12). Very quickly, poets and singers who performed at The Black Cat found the best practice for their craft to be had in Paris. Le Chat Noir eventually closed down in 1896. (After the death of Salis, a third Le Chat Noir was opened at 68, Boulevard de Clichy in 1907.)

Salis acted as impresario and (along with cabaret singer [[Aristide Bruant]]) as emcee, MC, or ''conférencier''. The greetings from Salis rang out often at the expense of customers. Those who left early were insulted, and those who arrived late were banished to a corner. Salis would arrest a customer with a "Well, you're finally out of prison?" or comment "What have you done with your chick from yesterday?" to a new client obviously accompanied by his wife. One evening, the future King [[Edward VII of England|Edward VII]] was addressed by Salis: "Well, look here: it looks like the [[Prince of Wales]] all [[drunkenness|pissed]]!"

Every Friday, luncheon was an opportunity to prepare for performances and the editing of a humorous magazine. With legendary stinginess,&lt;ref&gt;Journal ''The Châtelleraudais'' December 20O7&lt;/ref&gt; Salis found every excuse for not paying his staff, suppliers and artists. With some success he even asked to be paid by those whom he hosted at The Black Cat. But his patter to the guests and his organizational skills and personality attracted exceptional artists of all kinds, and a large crowd. The combination of a bar with entertainment (now the standard [[cabaret]] theme), was novel. In addition, Salis had the idea of playing music in his tavern by installing a piano,&lt;ref&gt;"Hommage à Salis le Grand", in ''88 notes pour piano solo'', [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], Neva Editions, 2015, p. 146. {{ISBN|978 2 3505 5192 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; at that time an innovation which was soon banned for newer establishments, and which thereafter allowed him to gain an advantage over the competition.

"Male, square-shouldered, red hair dyed vermilion," Salis was described by [[Lawrence Tailhade]], "ageless, though stout, his face channelled by many wrinkles, his chest in a romantic doublet whose floral satin contrasted with the sobriety of a dark coat. Intact, his tawny hair was consistent with his coppery beard and gave him the air of a Flemish trooper ... [He had] a bronze baritone, emphatic, biting and sarcastic, whose thunders cynically put down the Philistines ... [He had] a prodigiously charlatan nature."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Tailhade disliked because of Salis; Salis mockery made Public, ''Lawrence Tailhade or provocation considered a lifestyle'', Gilles Picq, Jean - Pierre Rioux, ed. Maisonneuve &amp; Larose, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, Salis took his The Black Cat entertainment company touring through France, hiring theatres and venues, a practice that was not current at that time. He often refused, under various pretexts, to pay the venue hire charge.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

He died in [[Naintré]] in 1897.

Many composers and singers of ''ryūkōka'' went on to earn official distinctions; [[Ichiro Fujiyama]] and composers [[Masao Koga]] and [[Ryoichi Hattori]] received the [[People's Honour Award]] in later years.

Although ''enka'' branched off from ''ryūkōka'', many singers of the latter genre proclaimed strong disdain for its stylistic descendant. In a 1981 interview, [[Noriko Awaya]] said "Whenever I hear ''enka'', I have to get away from the music because I feel like vomiting."&lt;ref name="nikkansports"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkansports.com/jinji/1999/seikyo990926.html|title=Tragic News: Noriko Awaya|publisher=[[Nikkan Sports]]|year=1999|accessdate=2009-01-17|language=ja|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222221654/http://www.nikkansports.com/jinji/1999/seikyo990926.html|archivedate=2009-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Original text: "演歌を聴くと胸がムカムカするから、あれが聴こえてくると逃げ回るんです。"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1914–1927: Origin ===
{{see also|Min'yō}}
In 1914, [[Sumako Matsui]]'s song "[[Katyusha's song]]", composed by [[Shinpei Nakayama]], was used as a theme of the rendition ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' in Japan. The record of the song sold 20,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fma.co.jp/pc/program/morning/today/0326/index.html|title=March 26|publisher=FM Aichi|accessdate=2009-02-19|language=ja|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195953/http://www.fma.co.jp/pc/program/morning/today/0326/index.html|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory holds that this was the first ''ryūkōka'' song, which was made by [[Hogetsu Shimamura]]'s order: "the tune between Japanese popular folk music and Western music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.itoigawa.niigata.jp/sisetu/rekimin/sakusi02.htm |title=Lyricist Sōma Gyofū's notable songs |publisher=[[Itoigawa, Niigata]] |accessdate=2009-02-18 |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416041324/http://www.city.itoigawa.niigata.jp/sisetu/rekimin/sakusi02.htm |archivedate=April 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Original text: "日本の俗謡と西洋歌曲の中間のような旋律"&lt;/ref&gt; However, street performers called {{nihongo|"[[enka]]-shi"|演歌師}} had been popular until record labels such as the [[JVC|Victor Company of Japan]] began to produce songs in the early [[Shōwa period]].&lt;ref name="habunominato"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.janjan.jp/column/0603/0603220226/1.php |script-title=ja:昭和流行歌の幕開け《波浮の港》 |author=Kiyomaro Kikuchi |publisher=[[JANJAN]] |date=2006-03-23 |accessdate=2009-01-23 |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110184316/http://www.news.janjan.jp/column/0603/0603220226/1.php |archivedate=2007-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Matsui committed suicide after Shimamura's death, Nakayama continued to develop his music. During his career, he composed about 3,000 songs such as the 1921 song "[[Teru teru bozu]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.nakano.nagano.jp/city/shogai/shinpei/sinnpeigyouseki.htm |title=Shinpei Nakayama's Profile |publisher=[[Nakano, Nagano|Nakano City]] |accessdate=2009-05-15 |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111080700/http://www.city.nakano.nagano.jp/city/shogai/shinpei/sinnpeigyouseki.htm |archivedate=November 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nakayama transferred Japanese traditional music to [[staff (music)|staff]]-style by main force. His 1921 song {{nihongo|"Sendō Kouta"|船頭小唄}} was later covered by various singers, but was at first best known for being covered by [[violin]] enka-shi {{nihongo|Shunyo Tottori|鳥取春陽|Tottori Shun'yō|1900–1932}} featuring [[Orchestra]]. The [[pentatonic scale]] used in this song was "[[Minor scale]] without forth and seventh [[degree (music)|degree]]". However, the music based on the scale had difficult in presenting [[chord (music)|chord]] and [[harmony]] because [[traditional Japanese music]] didn't adopt [[equal temperament]].&lt;ref name="soshienka"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elekitel.jp/elekitel/special/2006/13/sp_02_a.htm|title=Special 2.

Nakayama's songs were based on Japanese folk music called ''[[min'yō]]'', but also adopted Western musical style. Therefore, his music was called {{nihongo|"Shin Min'yō"|新民謡|lit. "New Folk Song"}}.&lt;ref name="soshienka" /&gt;

===1928–1930: Beginning of popularity===
{{double image|right|藤原義江.jpg|152|Chiyako Sato.jpg|125|[[Yoshie Fujiwara]] and [[Chiyako Sato]]}}
In the early Showa period, the [[microphone]] was introduced into the popular music of Japan. [[Teiichi Futamura]] released his cover version of {{nihongo|"Sing me A Song of Araby"|アラビヤの唄|Arabiya no Uta}} in 1928. The song was originally composed by [[Fred Fisher]]. [[Chiyako Sato]]'s 1928 song {{nihongo|"Habu no Minato"|波浮の港|lit. "Port of Habu"}}{{#tag:ref|Habu is a port in [[Izu Ōshima]].&lt;ref name="habunominato" /&gt;|group=fn}}, composed by Nakayama, sold 100,000 copies.&lt;ref name="habunominato" /&gt; The song was also sung by singer [[Yoshie Fujiwara]].&lt;ref name="habunominato" /&gt; Chiyako Sato's 1929 song "Tokyo March" sold more than 300,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Taylor E.

Some of the country's first major stars were singer [[Ichiro Fujiyama]] and composer [[Masao Koga]]. Koga attempted to initiate fusion of Western jazz and Japanese [[dodoitsu]].&lt;ref name="janjan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.janjan.jp/column/0604/0604182584/1.php |script-title=ja:酒は涙か溜息か―藤山一郎音楽学校停学事件 |author=Kiyomaro Kikuchi |publisher=[[JANJAN]] |date=2006-04-20 |accessdate=2009-01-16 |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206173933/http://www.news.janjan.jp/column/0604/0604182584/1.php |archivedate=2009-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fujiyama's 1931 song {{Nihongo|"Sake wa Namida ka Tameiki ka"|酒は涙か溜息か|lit.

This song created a fusion of Fujiyama's [[crooner|crooning]] and Koga's [[guitar]] play.&lt;ref name="janjan" /&gt; Using the vocal technic ''[[Mezza Voce]]'' with a microphone, Fujiyama sang the song by the deep voice of not [[Opera]]'s [[G minor]] but [[D minor]].&lt;ref name="janjan" /&gt; Fujiyama's song {{nihongo|"Oka o Koete"|丘を越えて|lit.

This period also saw the popularity of ''[[geisha]]'' singers such as [[Ichimaru]] and [[Katsutaro Kouta]]. Katsutaro became famous when Fujiyama was turned out of ''ryūkōka''.

When Fujiyama sang Western classic [[lied]] songs, those songs were called "[[kayōkyoku]]", but the term "kayōkyoku" went on to be used as another name of ''ryūkōka'' in [[NHK]].&lt;ref name="elekitel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elekitel.jp/elekitel/special/2006/13/sp_02_b.htm|title=Special 2.

[[Soprano]] singer [[Noriko Awaya]] also sang ''ryūkōka'', but the [[Tokyo College of Music|Toyo Music School]] once annulled her graduation.&lt;ref name="nikkansports" /&gt; However, her song {{nihongo|"Wakare no Blues"|別れのブルース|lit.

In 1936, [[NHK]] started radio program {{nihongo|"Kokumin Kayō"|国民歌謡|lit. "National Kayō"}} to compete with ''ryūkōka'', which was under the influence of "Ero Guro Nansensu", but it soon began to air [[war song]]s around July 1937.&lt;ref name="aikawa" /&gt; The program was renamed to {{nihongo|"Warera no Uta"|われらのうた|lit.

===1955–1963: Transformation of music===

{{main|Kayōkyoku}}
New singers such as [[Hibari Misora]], [[Hachiro Kasuga]], [[Michiya Mihashi]] and [[Chiyoko Shimakura]] became popular when old singers became unpopular.&lt;ref name="elekitel4" /&gt; The period between around 1955 and 1964 saw the popularity of "[[kayōkyoku]]".&lt;ref name="asahi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.co.jp/call3/diary/yamaken/essay_29.html |script-title=ja:雑感・戦後日本の世相と流行歌（29） |publisher=[[Asahi Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2009-01-27 |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206210117/http://www.asahi.co.jp/call3/diary/yamaken/essay_29.html |archivedate=2009-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Japanese composers went on to establish their own genres such as [[Toru Funamura]] and [[Minoru Endo]]'s "Enka", [[Tadashi Yoshida]]'s "Mood Kayō", and [[Hachidai Nakamura]] and [[Hiroshi Miyagawa]]'s "Jazz".&lt;ref name="miyagawa" /&gt; [[Masao Koga]] renounced his pre-war musical style, approaching Hibari Misora.&lt;ref name="elekitel4" /&gt;

The song "Otomisan" was made for being sung by Haruo Oka, but was eventually sung by [[Hachiro Kasuga]] and became a major hit in Japan in 1954. The single sold over one million copies.&lt;ref name="kasugahachiro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntv.co.jp/omoii-tv/today/081022.html|title=The day that enka singer Hachiro Kasuga died|publisher=[[Nippon Television]]|date=2008-10-22|accessdate=2009-04-22|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was composed by [[Masanobu Tokuchi]], who came from the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. Kasuga's 1955 song "Wakare no Ipponsugi", composed by Funamura, also became a hit song. Funamura also composed [[Michiya Mihashi]]'s 1955 song "Anoko Ga Naiteru Hatoba". ''Ryōkyōku'' singers such as [[Haruo Minami]] and [[Hideo Murata]] joined Japanese popular music. Hachiro Kasuga, Michiya Mihashi and Hideo Murata went on to form their genre later called ''enka''.&lt;ref name="kasugahachiro" /&gt;

[[File:Kyu school band.PNG|thumb|left|225px|[[Kyu Sakamoto]] and his school band]]
[[Frank Nagai]]'s 1957 song "[[Yūrakuchō de Aimashō]]", composed by Yoshida, also became popular. Around that time, however, Japanese [[rock and roll]] movement began and the [[Nichigeki Western Carnival]] was opened in 1958. The concerts were taken part in by future popular singers such as [[Mickey Curtis]] and [[Kyu Sakamoto]].

==History==

===Before independence===
The geography of sports in India dates back to the [[Vedas|Vedic]] era. Physical culture in ancient India was fuelled by religious rights. The [[mantra]] in the [[Atharvaveda]], says, "Duty is in my right hand and the fruits of victory in my left." In terms of an ideal, these words hold the same sentiments as the traditional [[Olympic Oath]]: "For the Honour of my Country and the Glory of Sport.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma Sushant, https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/sports-fanaticism-in-india-history-and-where-are-we-today&lt;/ref&gt;" Badminton probably originated in India as a grownup's version of a very old children's game known in England as [[battledore and shuttlecock]], the battledore being a paddle and the shuttlecock a small feathered cork, now usually called a "bird." Games like [[chess|chess (chaturanga)]], [[Snooker]] [[snakes and ladders]], playing [[Playing card|cards]], originated in India, and it was from here that these games were transmitted to foreign countries, where they were further modernised.

===After independence===
India hosted the [[Asian Games]] in New Delhi in 1951 and 1982. The [[Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (India)|Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports]] was initially set up as the Department of Sports in 1982 at the time of organisation of the IX Asian Games in New Delhi. Its name was changed to the Department of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports during celebration of the [[International Youth Year]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yas.nic.in/index.asp?layid=2 |title=Department of Sports |publisher=YAS |date= |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has also hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events, including the [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]] and [[1996 Cricket World Cup]], the [[2003 Afro-Asian Games]], the [[2010 Men's Hockey World Cup|2010 Hockey World Cup]], and the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]]. Major international sporting events annually held in India include the [[Chennai Open]], [[Mumbai Marathon]], [[Delhi Half Marathon]], and the [[Indian Masters]]. The country co-hosted the 1987, 1996, 2011 Cricket World Cup and the first [[Indian Grand Prix]] in 2011.

==Administration and funding==
Political responsibility for sport in India is with the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, which is headed by a cabinet minister and managed by National Sport Federations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yas.nic.in/writereaddata/linkimages/8940703031.htm |title=S |publisher=Yas.nic.in |date= |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only major exception is the BCCI which is the administrative body of Cricket, is not a NSF. Presently there are more than 70 recognised national sports federations (NSF), of which 38 have politicians at the helm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cppr.in/article/government-is-a-spoilsport/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sports Authority of India]], the field arm of the Ministry, supports and nurtures talent in youth, and provides them with requisite infrastructure, equipment, coaching facilities and competition exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsauthorityofindia.nic.in/ |title=Sports Authority of India, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports – Government of India |publisher=Sportsauthorityofindia.nic.in |date= |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorabji Tata]], with the support of Dr. A.G. Noehren, then director of [[YMCA]], established the [[Indian Olympic Association]] (IOA) in 1927. IOA is responsible for the Indian continent's participation in the [[Olympic Games]], [[Commonwealth Games]], [[Asian Games]] (outdoor, indoor and beach), and [[South Asian Games]]. Each Olympic and non-Olympic sport has a federation at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.ind.in/ioa_history.html |title=Indian Olympic Association |publisher=Olympic.ind.in |date= |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection of the national teams is done by the respective national federations and then recommend to IOA for official sponsorship for participation in the games conducted under the auspices of the [[International Olympic Committee]], [[Olympic Council of Asia]], [[Commonwealth Games Federation]], and SAG. A special feature of the Indian Olympic Association is that the National Federations and the State Olympic Associations are affiliated with and recognised by it. The main task of the State Olympic Associations is to promote the Olympic sport and to ensure co-ordination among the State Sports Associations. In 2010–11, the total budget for sports and physical education schemes is {{INRConvert|31177|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://yas.nic.in/writereaddata/linkimages/6831719428.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Field hockey|Hockey]], in which India has an impressive record with eight Olympic gold medals, is said to be the national sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EAyDe2XtOq4sXlmsK4ONzuYRmJ-hpXaZQuYXxWya9dQ/pub/ |title=1.Dr. RAMAKRISHNAN .K.S. 2 VIDYALAXMI V 3 Dr. SARATHBABU.V.

Shodh Sangam 2.special (2012): 248-255–Uttar Pradesh, India |publisher=http://shodhsangam.org/article/january-2012-special-issue-volume-2/8.html|date= |accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna]] and the [[Arjuna Award]] are India's highest awards for achievement in sports, while the [[Dronacharya Award]] is awarded for excellence in coaching.

India has been criticised for neglecting women in sports, as depicted in the film "[[Chak De! India]]", where women's sports associations are under-sponsored and out of funds.

[[File:Indian-Hockey-Team-Berlin-1936.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Indian Hockey team at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, later going on to defeat [[Germany men's national field hockey team|Germany]] 8–1 in the final.]]
A single athlete, [[Norman Pritchard]], represented India in the 1900 Olympics, winning two silver medals. India sent its first [[India at the 1920 Summer Olympics|national team to the Olympics in 1920]], and has participated in every [[Summer Olympic Games]] ever since. India has also competed at several [[Winter Olympic Games]] since 1964.

India has won a total of 26 Olympic medals. India won its first gold medal in men's [[field hockey]] in the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympic Games]]. [[Abhinav Bindra]] became the first Indian to win an individual gold medal at the Olympic Games, and India's first gold medal since [[1980 Moscow Olympics|1980]], when the [[India men's national field hockey team|men's field hockey team]] won the gold.&lt;ref name="rediff_abhinav_wins"&gt;

India has won very few Olympic medals, despite a population exceeding one billion, around half of them under the age of 25. Numerous explanations have been offered for the dearth, including poverty, [[malnutrition]],  neglected infrastructure, the lack of [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]], the theft of money and equipment, political corruption, institutional disorganisation, social immobility, the predominance of [[cricket]], and other cultural factors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/sports/olympics/12indiagold.html?ref=olympics New York Times: With India’s First Gold, Suddenly a Billion People Notice the Olympics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportstaronnet.com/tss2738/stories/20040918005300800.htmThe mystery of the missing medals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/25/india.olympicgames2008 Track and failed: the making of a sleeping Olympic giant]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/sports/2008/aug/04rajeev.htm Olympic machismo: The tale the medals tell]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to several informal statistics, India is the country with the lowest number of total Olympic medals per capita (out of those countries which have won at least one medal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olympic Medals/Population |url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/medals2.html |publisher=Photius Coutsoukis |accessdate=20 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Per Capita Olympic Medal Table  |url=http://users.skynet.be/hermandw/olymp/reloly.html |accessdate=20 August 2008 |publisher=Herman de Wael }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Winter Olympic Games, India has seen four consecutive representations–[[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]] (Japan, 1998), [[Salt Lake City]] ([[Utah]], USA, 2002), [[Turin]] (Italy, 2006), and [[Vancouver]] ([[British Columbia]], Canada, 2010). [[Shiva Keshavan]], Asian Champion in [[luge]] represented India in all four winter games.

===The National Games of India===
{{Main|National Games of India}}
The National Games of India is a sporting event held in India. It comprises various disciplines in which sportsmen from the different states of India participate against each other. The country's first few Olympic Games, now christened as National Games.

Shooting is an important Olympic sport in India. Of India's 26 Olympic medals, 4 have come from Shooting including a Gold by Abhinav Bindra in the 2008 Olympics. Indian shooters who have excelled at the world stage include Abhinav Bindra, Jitu Rai, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Vijay Kumar, Gagan Narang, Apurvi Chandela, Ronjan Sodhi and Anjali Bhagwat.

The Indian shooting contingent for the 2012 London was one of the largest to date. There were a total of 11 shooters including 4 female shooters. India's first medal in the 2012 Olympics was when Gagan Narang won the bronze in the 10m Air Rifle event. This was the same event in which Abhinav Bindra won India's first individual gold medal in the 2008 Summer Olympics Beijing. The second medal came from the unheralded army man Vijay Kumar when he won the silver in the 25m rapid fire pistol event after finishing 4th in the qualification rounds. He had to fend off some tough competition from the third-placed Chinese Ding Feng.

A notable performance was made by Joydeep Karmakar who finished 4th in the 50m rifle prone event. A strong medal prospect Ronjan Sodhi who is an Asian Games gold medallist, however, crashed out in the qualification rounds of the Double trap event.

=== Field Hockey ===
{{Main|Field hockey in India}}

Field Hockey is a popular sport in India. Until the mid-1970s, [[India men's national field hockey team|India men's team]] dominated international field hockey, winning 7 Olympic gold medals and won the [[1975 Men's Hockey World Cup]]. Since then, barring a gold medal at the [[Field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympics]], India's performance in field hockey has been dismal, with other hockey-playing nations such as [[Australia men's national field hockey team|Australia]], [[Netherlands men's national field hockey team|Netherlands]] and [[Germany men's national field hockey team|Germany]] improving their standards and catching up with India. Its decline is also due to the change in rules of the game, introduction of artificial turf, and internal politics in Indian field hockey bodies. The popularity of field hockey has also declined massively parallel to the decline of the Indian hockey team. In recent years, the standard of Indian hockey has gone from bad to worse, with the [[India men's national field hockey team| Men's team]] not qualifying for the [[2008 Olympics]] and finishing last in the [[2012 Olympics]]. Since 2014, the men's team is trying to regain its lost glory little by little as they become runners up at the [[Hockey at the 2014 Commonwealth Games – Men's tournament|2014 Commonwealth Games]], then winning a much needed [[Field hockey at the 2014 Asian Games|2014]] Asian Games gold and [[2017 Men's Hockey Asia Cup]] to finally establishing the Asian dominance after long time but before that India lost to [[Belgium men's national field hockey team|Belgium]] in the quarter final of [[Field hockey at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Rio Olympics]]. India men's hockey team is eyeing for gold at the [[2018 Men's Hockey World Cup]] as its going to hold in India, as support of home crowds which is a must need to defeat the aura of the Australians who constantly dominating the Indian team in the recent years in various finals such as the [[2014 Men's Hockey Champions Trophy|2014]] &amp; [[2018 Men's Hockey Champions Trophy|2018]] [[Hockey Champions Trophy]]. Currently, the Indian men's team is [[FIH World Rankings|5th]] in the rankings of the Fédération Internationale de Hockey sur Gazon (FIH, English:[[International Hockey Federation]]), the international governing body of field hockey and indoor field hockey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/rankings/outdoor/|title=Hero FIH Rankings Outdoor|website=fih.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[India women's national field hockey team|Women's team]] came of age in [[Field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament|1980]] when they first participated at the Summer Olympics and achieved the 4th place. The first golden moment for the team was in [[Field hockey at the 1982 Asian Games|1982]] at the Asian Games. Since then not much of happening moments in the team history, though in [[Field hockey at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament|2016]] after 34 years, its a little hope when Indian women's team qualified for the Summer Olympics and they went on to win the [[2017 Women's Hockey Asia Cup]] claiming the Asian dominance after 2004. India Women's team failed to win any medal in the [[Women's Hockey World Cup]]. The present team is ranked [[FIH World Rankings|10th]] by the [[Fédération Internationale de Hockey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fih.ch/rankings/outdoor/|title=Hero FIH Rankings Outdoor|website=fih.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

India has hosted two Men's Hockey World Cups–one in [[1982 Men's Hockey World Cup|1982]] in [[Mumbai]], and another in [[2010 Men's Field hockey World Cup|2010]] in Delhi, where they finished fifth and eighth respectively. India also hosted the annual [[Hockey Champions Trophy]] in 1996, 2005 and 2014. Until 2008, the [[Indian Hockey Federation]] (IHF) was the apex body for hockey in the country. However, following revelations of corruption and other scandals in the IHF, the federation was dissolved and de-recognised, and a new apex body for Indian hockey called [[Hockey India]] (HI) was formed on 20 May 2009, with support from the IOA and former hockey players. HI, recognised by the [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH), has the sole mandate to govern and conduct all activities for both [[India men's national field hockey team|men's]] and [[India women's national Field hockey team|women's]] field hockey in India. Although the IHF was reinstated in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnewsonline.net/sports/2154-kps-gill-and-ihf-reinstated-by-delhi-high-court.html |title=KPS Gill and IHF reinstated by Delhi High Court |publisher=Breakingnewsonline.net |date=22 May 2010 |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not recognised by the FIH. The IHF conducts a franchise-based tournament called [[World Series Hockey]] (WSH), with its first season conducted in [[2012 World Series Hockey|2012]]. However, it is not approved by HI or the FIH.

HI also conducts a franchise-based tournament called the [[Hockey India League]] (HIL). Its first season was in [[2013 Hockey India League|2013]] and is inspired from the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI's) highly successful Indian Premier League. The tournament is recognised by the FIH, which has also decided to provide a 30-day window for the forthcoming seasons so that all top players can participate.

[[Association football|Football]] was introduced to India during the British colonial period. Although India has never been represented in any [[FIFA World Cup]], it did qualify in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]], though it did not take part, as they were not allowed to play barefoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Arunava|last=Chaudhuri |url=http://www.indianfootball.de/data/worldcupq.html |title=The Indian National Team's World Cup qualifying |publisher=Indianfootball.de |date= |accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; India was an Asian powerhouse in football in the 1950s and 1960s. During this golden era, India created history as the first Asian team to reach semi-finals in an Olympic football tournament in [[1956 Summer Olympics]] at Melbourne and [[Neville D'Souza]] became the first Asian and Indian to score a hat-trick (record remains unbeaten) in an Olympic match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Football: India's day of Glory at Melbourne |url=http://www.sportskeeda.com/2012/12/01/indias-day-of-glory-at-melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/419406.cms|title=Mumbai salutes soccer legend|date=13 January 2004|accessdate=8 March 2009|author=Nitin N. Sethi|publisher=''The Indian Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; India also finished as runners-up in the [[1964 AFC Asian Cup]]. But later on, the standard of football started to decline due to lack of professionalism and [[fitness culture]]. India currently ranks 97th in the [[FIFA rankings]] as of 10 August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=India: FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking - FIFA.com |url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/ |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506101624/https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/ |archivedate=6 May 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Football is, nevertheless, widely popular both as a [[spectator sport]], and as a participation sport in some parts of the country such as [[Kerala]], West Bengal, [[Goa]] and the [[Northeast India|Northeast]]. The [[India national football team]] represents India in all [[FIFA]] tournaments. The [[Yuva Bharati Krirangan]] of [[Kolkata]] was the [[List of stadiums by capacity|second largest non-auto racing stadium]] in the world.

In June 1937, at the Army Headquarters, [[Shimla]], the [[All India Football Federation]] (AIFF) was formed at a meeting of the representatives of football associations of six regions where the game was very popular in those days. It is the governing body for [[football in India]]. Domestic competitions for men's football include the [[Indian Super League]], [[I-League]], [[I-League 2nd Division]] in the [[Football in India#League system|Indian League System]] and the annual knock-out style [[Federation Cup (India)|Federation Cup]]. For women's football the [[India women's football championship]]. However, it is European football, such as the English [[Premier League]], Spanish [[La Liga]], and the [[UEFA Champions League]], which are very popular among Indian football fans, especially in [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] cities.

The [[2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup]] will be the 17th tournament of the [[FIFA U-17 World Cup]]. FIFA revealed on 5 December 2013 (as part of their Executive Committee meets in Salvador, Brazil), that India will be the host. This will be the first time India will host an international football competition at world level.&lt;ref&gt;[[2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup]]&lt;/ref&gt; To help increase interest in youth football in advance of the 2017 U-17 World Cup, India has launched the [[Mission XI Million]] programme.

Tennis is a sport among Indians in urban areas. Tennis has gained popularity after the exploits of [[Vijay Amritraj]]. India's fortunes in [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles have been unimpressive, although [[Leander Paes]] won a singles bronze medal at the 1996 Olympics. Since the late 1990s India has had impressive results in Grand Slam doubles, Leander Paes and [[Mahesh Bhupathi]] have won many men's doubles and mixed doubles Grand Slam titles.

[[File:Wrestling in india.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Military World Games]] in [[Hyderabad, India]].]]
Considered one of the most ancient and oldest sports in the world, [[wrestling]] in India has a glorious past. The sport of wrestling began its journey in India several centuries ago, during the [[Middle Ages]]. Wrestling is among the most prestigious and oldest events in the [[Olympic Games]]. It was included in the Olympics in 708 BC. In ancient times, wrestling in India was mainly used as a way to stay physically fit. It was also used as a [[military exercise]] without any weapons. Wrestling in India is also known as ''dangal,'' and it is the basic form of a wrestling tournament.

In India, wrestling is mostly known as ''Malla-Yuddha''. There are mentions of wrestling in the ancient times, found in the [[Sanskrit]] epic of [[Indian history]], ''[[Mahabharata]]''. One of the premier characters in Mahabharata, [[Bhima]], was considered to be a great wrestler. Other great wrestlers included [[Jarasandha]], [[Duryodhana]], and [[Karna]]. Another Indian epic, [[Ramayana]], also mentions wrestling in India, describing [[Hanuman]] as one of the greatest wrestlers of that time. The 13th-century ''[[Malla Purana]]'' references a group of [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] [[Brahmin]] wrestlers known as [[Jyesthimalla]]s.

[[Rugby union]] is a minor, but fast-growing, sport in India. Some Indian sporting clubs are beginning to embrace the game, and it is the second most popular winter sport after football in India,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} which itself trails in popularity after cricket and field hockey.

=== Cycling ===
{{Main|Cycling in India}}
{{See also|Cycling Federation of India}}
The history of cycling in India dates back to 1938, and the [[Cycling Federation of India]] governs the sport. Though cycling is unknown as a professional sport in India, it is popular as a common recreational sport and a way to keep fit.

;Mountain biking

[[Mountain biking]] is becoming a popular sport in India. For the last six years, [[Mtb himachal]], a hardcore endurance event, has been organised regularly by Himalayan Adventure Sports &amp; Tourism Promotion Association (HASTPA), a non-governmental organisation (NGO). A number of national and international riders participate, including Indian Army, [[Indian Air Force]], [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]] (ITBP), and a number of young and energetic mountain biking individual riders from cities including [[Pune]], Bangalore, Delhi and [[Chandigarh]]. Last year{{when|date=July 2013}}, the government of [[Sikkim]] (Department of Tourism) introduced its own mountain biking race, with Southeast Asia's biggest prize money. The second edition saw 48 professional participants from around the globe.

;Road Cycling/ Touring

The [[Tour of Nilgiris]] is a major non-competitive &amp; non-commercial touring event in South Asia that covers 1,000 kilometres in under 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=admin, on 30 May 2010 |url=http://tourofnilgiris.com/ |title=The Tour of Nilgiris |publisher=The Tour of Nilgiris |date= |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tour of Nilgiris (TfN), India's first Day Touring Cycle Ride, was born in December 2008 with the twin objectives of promoting bicycling as an activity and spreading awareness about the bio-diversity, flora and fauna of the Nilgiris.

It soon grew into something a lot more, with an eclectic riding community in 2008 wanting to take part in. The community soon got together, chalked out plans, figured out a route and realised they would need a framework to support such a large group of people, got sponsors on board to mitigate costs as well as popularise the Tour and the Cause of popularising Cycling as a viable and sustainable means of travel. Ever since its first edition, the TfN has stayed true to the Community of Cyclists in India by being a Tour for the Community, Of the Community and By the Community. It has grown in size, stature and visibility. From 40 riders in the first edition, its grown to 100 cyclists in 2013.

The tour has grown bigger &amp; the routes tougher, allowing cyclists to test their endurance, enjoy the biodiversity of the Nilgiris covering 3 southern states in India (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu &amp; Kerala). For the racing aficionado's, there are racing segments on the tour with colour coded jerseys, recognition and prizes. TfN as its lovingly called is pushing cycling to new frontiers with more and more interested cyclists, applying for the tour. The tour has acquired quite a name, and currently about 25% of registrations are selected for the tour by the organisers.

=== Equestrian sports ===
{{Main|Equestrian sport in India}}
India has a wide following in various [[equestrian sports]], including [[show jumping]], [[eventing]], [[dressage]], [[endurance riding]] and [[tent pegging]]. Supported by the Equestrian Federation of India, eventing is the most popular of the five, with teams representing the country at most [[Asian Games]], winning a bronze medal in the 2002 and 2006 games. India has been represented at the Olympics twice, by Wing Commander I.J. Lamba, and Imtiaz Anees.

===Kayaking===
{{Main|Kayaking in India}}

;Flat water and sea kayaking
Indian flat water [[kayak]]ers are an emerging powerhouse on the Asian circuit. Outside of professional flat water [[kayaking]], there is very limited recreational kayaking. The potential to generate interest in flat water kayaking is held by leisure [[resort]]s located near the sea or other water bodies. Indian tourists tend to consider kayaking a one-time activity, rather than a sport to be pursued.

;Whitewater kayaking
Enthusiasts of [[whitewater]] kayaking are concentrated in the north towards the [[Himalayas]], with some in the south in Bangalore in [[Karnataka]]. Most of these enthusiasts are or were whitewater raft guides who took to the sport of whitewater kayaking. Some of the prominent whitewater kayakers include Abhinav Kala, Shalabh Gahlaut, and John Pollard. Many of them have notched first descents (similar to climbing ascents) on rivers in India and Nepal.

"Bangalore Kayakers" or "Southern River Runners" are India's first amateur group of white water kayakers. Based out of Bangalore, they explore rivers around [[Western Ghats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=149952787372&amp;ref=ts |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lure for most of these participants is adventure. Whitewater kayaking in India allows for exploration of places where, literally, no human has been before.

Gear availability is a problem that plagues kayakers. While the global designs for whitewater boats and paddles change annually, Indian kayakers have to pay high fees if they want to import any kind of gear, or they have to buy used gear in Nepal. More often than not, one will see Indian kayaking guides riding down the river in a Perception Amp, Piroutte or Dancer designs, while the kayakers from abroad ride the river in their new design, planing hull, centred volume kayaks from Riot, Pyranha, or Wave Sport.

Kayaking India groups on Facebook are good resources for kayakers in India.

The comment was widely reported in the press. Later, the coach revealed that, "In August 2009, we had no equipment. Ashish trained on hard floor till February 2010, and then we got equipment around 20 years old." The federation announced that no Indian team would travel to [[Rotterdam]] for the World Championships in October, which would mean that Indian gymnasts would not have the opportunity to qualify as a team for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/commonwealth-games-2010/india-news/Officials-ask-Ashishs-coach-Only-a-bronze/articleshow/6716378.cms|title=Officials ask Ashish's coach: Only a bronze?|date=9 October 2010|work=The Times of India|first1=V Narayan|last1=Swamy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.intlgymnast.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1973:no-worlds-for-india-coach-blasts-federation&amp;catid=2:news&amp;Itemid=166|title=No Worlds for India: Coach Blasts Federation|date=10 October 2010|publisher=International Gymnast Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashish also won a silver medal in the [[Gymnastics at the 2010 Commonwealth Games – Men's vault|Men's vault]] at [[2010 Commonwealth Games]].

Its development has been closely tied in with the history of the country, mirroring many of the political and cultural developments around issues such as [[caste]], [[gender]], religion, and nationality. The Indian national cricket team played its first official match (a [[Test cricket|Test]]) in 1932 against England, and the team's performance since then has generally been mixed, sometimes enjoying stupendous success and sometimes suffering outright failure. The highest profile rival of the [[India national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] is the [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistani cricket team]], though, in recent times, it has gained other rivals, including [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] and [[England national cricket team|England]].

[[Kabaddi]] is a popular national sport in India, played mainly among people in villages. It is regarded as a team-contact sport and as a recreational form of [[combat]] training.

Two teams occupy opposite halves of a small field and take turns sending a raider into the other half to win points by tagging and wrestling members of the opposing team. The raider then attempts to return to his own half while holding his breath and chanting "kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi" during the whole raid.

India has won gold in all the [[Asian Games]] in [[kabaddi]] excepting 2018 Asian games where they got bronze. The four forms of kabaddi recognised by Kabaddi federation in India are [[Kabaddi#Amar|Amar]], [[Kabaddi#Sanjeevani|Sanjeevni]], [[Kabaddi#Gaminee|Gaminee]] and Punjabi rules Kabaddi.

=== Polo ===
{{Main|Polo in India}}
[[File:Polo jaipur.jpg|thumb|upright=0.56|alt=Fullright|Polo]]
India is considered the cradle of modern [[polo]]. [[Babur]], the founder of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the 15th century, firmly established its popularity. The period between the decline of the Mughal dynasty and the upsurgence of the British Imperial rule, polo almost vanished from mainland India. Fortunately, the game survived in a few remote mountainous [[Enclave and exclave|enclaves]] of the [[subcontinent]], notably [[Gilgit]], [[Chitral]], [[Ladakh]], and [[Manipur]].

In India, the popularity of polo has waned and risen many times. However, it has never lost its regal status. In the last few decades, the emergence of privately owned teams has ensured a renaissance in Indian polo. Today, polo is not just restricted to the royalty and the [[Indian Army]].

'''''Still Open All Hours''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] sitcom created by [[Roy Clarke]] for the BBC set in [[Balby]], Doncaster, starring [[David Jason]]. It is the sequel to the sitcom ''[[Open All Hours]]'', which both Clarke and Jason worked on throughout its 26 episode run from 1973 to 1985, following a 40th Anniversary Special in December 2013 commemorating the original series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a521620/sir-david-jason-to-star-in-open-all-hours-christmas-special.html|title=Sir David Jason to star in 'Open All Hours' Christmas special|last=Goodacre|first=Kate|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=7 October 2013|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the original series, the story focuses on the life of Granville as he continues to run his uncle Arkwright's shop, with the assistance of his son Leroy, while seeking to be with his love interest. Unlike the original series, the cast includes a more regular group of characters and additional side-plots concerning them, and features the return of [[Lynda Baron]], [[Stephanie Cole]], and [[Maggie Ollerenshaw]] as their respective characters in ''Open All Hours''.

Following the 2013 special, the show has run five full-length series, with the first of them premiering on 26 December 2014.

==Premise==
Set within the same small grocer's shop in [[Balby]], a suburb of [[Doncaster]] in [[South Yorkshire]], the show focuses on the life of [[Granville (Open All Hours)|Granville]] ([[David Jason]]), now much older and the owner of [[Arkwright (Open All Hours)|Arkwright]]'s shop since his uncle's death. Despite his youth's lacklustre social life, Granville has since grown into the same person as his uncle, having been taught by him over how to sell to customers. To assist him with the running of his shop is Leroy ([[James Baxter (actor)|James Baxter]]), Granville's son from one of his previous girlfriends, who maintains a rather robust love life with several girls but struggles to cope with the work and sales approach of his father.

Like his uncle, Granville maintains a love life with Mavis ([[Maggie Ollerenshaw]]), an absent-minded but sweet woman who loves him in return, but who lives across the road alongside her sister Madge	([[Brigit Forsyth]]), a miserable woman who does not like men and chooses to keep Mavis from following a relationship with Granville. Both are regulars to the shop, alongside others from the neighbourhood whom Granville tries to offload products onto, which he has bought and had little success to sell on.

==Characters==
{{Main article|List of Open All Hours characters}}
===Granville===
{{Main article|Granville (Open All Hours)|l1=Granville}}
Since ''Open All Hours'', having lived his youth as a nice, yet shy and awkward man who struggled with shop life, Granville has changed into a more toned-down version of his uncle Arkwright, who thanks to his uncle's training, now exhibits a similar manner of selling goods at inflated prices, fabricating stories to sell useless and/or unsalable items to hapless customers, and keeping a close watch on the money he spends, often through employing the use of a special money belt that cause slight issues and embarrassment at times. During his uncle's training, Granville engaged in relationships with several girlfriends, in which a fling in Blackpool resulted in the procreation of his son Leroy, whom he was left in charge of by his mother. Following his uncle's death, Granville inherited his shop, which he runs alongside Leroy, often teasing his son over the identity of his mother, secretly concealing the fact he knows who it is, while subjecting him to practical jokes and teaching him some of the tricks that his uncle taught him. In ''Still Open All Hours'', he maintains a belief that his uncle lives on through the shop's till, often referring to it as Arkwright in later episodes, due to the nature of it opening up or closing shut suddenly at times for various reasons, such as when there is mention of spending considerable money on something.

Like his uncle, Granville has a love interest of his own within Mavis, a woman he met during his youth and whom he still fondly loves. Unlike his uncle, Granville struggles to be with Mavis since the end of her previous marriage, due to her sister Madge desiring to keep them apart. To try to keep Madge distracted and hopefully remove her as an obstacle, Granville spends his time grooming one of his regulars, Gastric, into becoming Madge's love interest. In later episodes, he also finds himself trying to stop the advances of widower Delphine Featherstone, one of his uncle's customers whom he accidentally sent a love note to that was meant for Mavis, by convincing a fellow widower, Wilburn Newbold, into entering a relationship with her and maintaining it, despite Mrs Featherstone's presence unnerving him.

===Leroy===
Leroy was born to a mother whom his father met during a fling in Blackpool, but whom he does not know about, despite Granville secretly knowing who she is; although his mother is talked about during the first series, including a visit by her to see Leroy, references about her become rare and non-existent in later episodes. Left into his father's care by his mother at a young age, Leroy suffers similar issues like Granville did in his youth, such as having to be up early to open the shop and thus being on the receiving end of his father's practical jokes, and handling the deliveries of purchases to customers. Unlike his father, Leroy maintains an active social life with many young women, most having boyfriends that they don't mind ignoring to spend time with him, much to his father's dismay, while displaying a firm dislike of his father's practices for unloading products he buys cheaply but cannot sell. By the fourth series, Leroy becomes committed to winning the affection of a local librarian, despite her values and her lifestyle as a vegan.

===Filming locations===
[[File:Lister Avenue in Balby (a suburb of Doncaster in the North of England), used for the exterior shots on the BBC television sitcom Open All Hours.jpg|thumb|Lister Avenue in [[Balby]] is used for the filming of '' Still Open All Hours''; Boutique on the right doubles as Arkwright's]]
The exterior shots reused the original shop from the series, on Lister Avenue in [[Balby]], a suburb of [[Doncaster]]. The shop had to be extensively redressed (for both programmes) to resemble a traditional corner shop, as it has been a hair salon since 1962. This process took two days, before filming on location for three consecutive days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Wilkes|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2450383/Real-life-shops-inspired-BBCs-Open-All-Hours.html|title=The real life shops behind Open All Hours: How a hairdressers and a c-c-convenience store helped inspire the BBC sitcom that is about to be resurrected for Christmas special|publisher=Mail Online|date=19 November 2013|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The studio recordings for the 2013 special were recorded at [[Dock10 (television facility)|dock10]] at [[MediaCityUK]]. For the first series, [[Teddington Studios]] were used and the second, third, and fourth series were all recorded at [[Pinewood Studios]].

==Broadcast and reception==
The special was broadcast on BBC One on 26 December 2013 and received 9.43m (39.9% of the audience) viewers according to overnight figures and was the most watched programme on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sam|last=Rigby|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a540642/still-open-all-hours-tops-boxing-day-ratings-with-94m.html|title=Still Open All Hours tops Boxing Day ratings with 9.4m|publisher=Digital Spy|date=27 December 2013|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Final viewing figures showed that it was watched by 12.23m and was the most watched programme for that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/dec/27/still-open-all-hours-largest-audience-boxing-day|title=Top 30s|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received generally poor reviews from critics. Will Dean of ''[[The Independent]]'', referencing Arkwright's trademark stutter, called it "a w-w-worthy effort" but criticised the attempt to revive the show without the late [[Ronnie Barker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Will|last=Dean|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/still-open-all-hours-review-it-was-a-wwworthy-effort--but-theres-only-one-arkwright-9026351.html|title=Still Open All Hours review: It was a w-w-worthy effort – but there’s only one Arkwright|publisher=The Independent|date=26 December 2013|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Lawrence of ''[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]'' said it "felt like a relic of another era" criticising the jokes and Jason's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ben|last=Lawrence|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10537092/Still-Open-All-Hours-BBC-One-review.html|title=Still Open All Hours, BBC One, review|publisher=The Telegraph|date=26 December 2013|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Mason, writing on the Radio Times website, described the show as "warmly nostalgic", whilst others noted it as "a fitting tribute to Ronnie Barker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marc|last=Andrews|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2529610/Still-Open-All-Hours-hailed-warmly-nostalgic-fitting-tribute-Ronnie-Barker.html|title=TV viewers hail the one-off return of classic sitcom Open All Hours as 'warmly nostalgic' and 'a fitting tribute to Ronnie Barker'|publisher=Daily Mail|date=26 December 2013|accessdate=4 January 2014}} Jojo Martin praised the show saying " I loved Open All Hours and I love    Still Open All Hours even more, Still Open is the one of the best comedy series on our screens".&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November 2014, the BBC confirmed that ''Still Open All Hours'' would return for a full series in 2014.

'''''The Last of the Greats''''' is a comic book [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] created by writer [[Joshua Hale Fialkov]] and artist [[Brent Peeples]]. It was published by [[Image Comics]] from October 5, [[2011 in comics|2011]] through February [[2012 in comics|2012]]. A sequel, ''Return of the Greats'', is forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comicattack.net/2012/02/lastofthegreats5 Review of issue 5], Comic Attack. Feb 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
It takes place in a world where seven alien super powered beings known as the ''Greats'' have eliminated disease, poverty, and social inequality. At the start of the story humanity found a way to kill all of the Greats save one, who kept himself hidden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/last-of-the-greats-interview-fialkov-110928.html |title=Coming Apocalypse? THE LAST OF THE GREATS Doesn't Care |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; never bothering to try to help Earth like his siblings did. Now humanity must plead with the last of the Greats to stop an alien invasion that threatens the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=33156 |title=Fialkov is "The Last of the Greats" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several startling revelations that take place during the first 5 issues of this tale. We find out that though the Greats seemingly died, they are beings of energy and therefore have been absorbed by their remaining brother, who is now extorting the human race into complete subjugation for his help. Next, we find out that when the Last Great seeks to engage the alien ships, he actually goes aboard one of them and seems to be in charge of the fleet, which he then orders 2/3s of the earth's population to be destroyed. In flashbacks we see that the Last Great's sister actually sired a child with her adviser and the child has abilities like the other Greats, but she is being kept hidden from the Last Great for her own protection.

Later in the story, the Last Great is attacked by his "niece", and during the battle, the reader is given a glimpse of the other Greats in a big field under a tree that represents them being part of the Last Great's subconscious, mingling and talking with each other. Due to the Last Great's niece fighting with him, the internal struggle with the other Greats causes them to attempt to release themselves from his body. All of the Greats do this, except for one woman. We then find out that the Last Great and this woman have plotted to have the others release themselves and float around as formless energy so that they can enact a master plan that they have been planning for some time.

==Collected editions==
The first series was collected into a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]:
* ''Volume 1'' (collects ''Last of the Greats'' #1–5, xxx pages, Image Comics, paperback, March 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-60706-518-0}})

==Reception==
Jamil Scalese of [[Comics Bulletin]] called the story "page-turning, jaw-dropping" and stated "The Last of the Greats sets itself up to be one the best mindfuck comics to hit shelves recently."
