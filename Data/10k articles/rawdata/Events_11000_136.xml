The '''Abryanz Style and Fashion Awards''', also known as the '''ASFAs''', are continental fashion awards presented annually in Uganda by Abryanz Collection to recognize excellence and outstanding achievement in the [[fashion]] industry in Uganda and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abryanz Style and Fashion Awards 2017 rock Kampala |url=https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1467349/abryanz-style-fashion-awards-2017-rock-kampala |website=New Vision |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Abryanz Style and Fashion Awards were established in 2013 by fashion stylist and proprietor of Abryanz Collection Brian Ahumuza in Uganda. The inaugural event was held at MTN Arena in [[Lugogo, Kampala]], with subsequent events held at the Serena Hotel in Kampala. The awards started with a focus on Ugandan fashion, and categories for the rest of Africa were added in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ABRYANZ STYLE &amp; FASHION AWARDS |url=http://www.btendancewebzine.com/article/abryanz-style-fashion-awards/ |website=Btendancewebzine |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of Lifetime / Style Fashion Icon Achievement, which is not voted for, is awarded to an individual for their significant contribution to the fashion industry. It was awarded to [[Princess Elizabeth of Toro]] (Uganda) in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Princess Elizabeth Bagaya receives Lifetime Style &amp; Fashion Icon Achievement Award 2015. |url=https://bigeye.ug/princess-elizabeth-bagaya-receives-lifetime-style-fashion-icon-achievement-award-2015/ |website=Big Eye |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mai Atafo]] (Nigeria) in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Designer Mai Atafo Wins Lifetime Style And Fashion Icon Achievement |url=https://guardian.ng/life/international-designer-mai-atafo-wins-lifetime-style-and-fashion-icon-achievement/ |website=The Guardian |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aleppo offensive of October–November 2016''', named the '''"Battle of the Hero Martyr Abu Omar Saraqib"''' by the [[Army of Conquest]],&lt;ref name="new" /&gt; refers to a military operation launched on the western outskirts of [[Aleppo]] at the end of October 2016 by rebel forces in [[Syria]], against the [[Syria]]n government forces and its allies. The aim of the offensive was to establish a new supply line into Aleppo city, after an [[2016 Aleppo campaign|Army-initiated summer campaign]] had cut off all rebel access to Aleppo.

The rebels called the operation "the mother of all battles", or "the grand battle of Aleppo", and described it as possibly deciding the outcome of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2016/10/syrian-rebels-launch-aleppo-counterattack-161028081848190.html|title=Syrian rebels launch Aleppo counterattack|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aranews.net/2016/10/islamists-hit-syrian-army-convoy-near-aleppo-dozens-killed/|title=Islamists rebels hit Syrian Army convoy bound for Aleppo, dozens killed - ARA News|date=30 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/syrian-rebels-push-west-against-assad-forces-aleppo-515958|title=Syrian rebels push West against Assad forces in Aleppo|date=1 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After making early advances, the rebel offensive soon slowed and stalled.&lt;ref name=makegains&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-aleppo-idUSKBN13709H|title=Syrian army and allies make gains in Aleppo|date=12 November 2016|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-November, government troops regained control of all areas lost at the start of the rebel offensive, as well as areas lost in the [[Aleppo offensive (July–August 2016)|earlier rebel offensive]] during the summer campaign.&lt;ref name=454killed/&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{main|Aleppo offensive (November–December 2016)}}
Following the successful campaign by pro-government forces, the rebels in eastern-Aleppo were given 24 hours to surrender before the Army started an offensive to completely recapture the rebel-held districts in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-gives-jihadists-24-hours-surrender-launching-massive-offensive-aleppo/|title=Syrian Army gives jihadists 24 hours to surrender before launching massive offensive in Aleppo|first=Leith|last=Fadel|date=13 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the offensive, food and medicine were reportedly smuggled from the [[YPG]]-held [[Sheikh Maqsood]] into rebel-held eastern Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aawsat.com/2016/11/article55362033/aleppo-deadlock-eased-kurdish-merchants|title=Aleppo Deadlock Eased by Kurdish Merchants|work=Aawsat|date=13 November 2016|access-date=14 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114165846/http://english.aawsat.com/2016/11/article55362033/aleppo-deadlock-eased-kurdish-merchants|archive-date=14 November 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reactions==
[[Amnesty International]] stated that the "armed opposition groups have displayed a shocking disregard for civilian lives", deploying weapons "whose use in the vicinity of densely populated civilian areas flagrantly violates [[laws of war|international humanitarian law]]". The organization called the rebel groups to "end all attacks that fail to distinguish between military targets and civilians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/10/syria-end-unlawful-attacks-in-western-aleppo-city-by-armed-opposition-groups/|title=Syria: Armed opposition groups must end unlawful attacks in western Aleppo|work=Amnesty|date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] special envoy for Syria, [[Staffan de Mistura]], expressed that he was "appalled and shocked" by the attacks targeting civilians in Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37816938|title=Aleppo siege: UN envoy Mistura 'appalled' by rebel attacks|date=30 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2016|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later stated that some rebel groups had been preventing civilians leaving eastern Aleppo.&lt;ref name=independent-20161203&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/aleppo-battle-syrian-civil-war-latest-advance-russia-ready-for-talks-withdrawal-opposition-jihadists-a7453996.html |title=Aleppo: Russia 'ready for talks' on rebel withdrawal as Syrian forces continue advance on besieged districts |author=Lizzie Dearden |newspaper=The Independent |date=3 December 2016 |accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aniwave''' was an annual one day anime convention held during December at the Wilmington Convention Center in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. 

==Programming==
The convention typically offered a costume contest, demonstrations, panels, vendors, and workshops.&lt;ref name="sno11162010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sno12082013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20131208/ARTICLES/131209762|title=There's a reason to get all dressed up at Aniwave convention|publisher=Star News Online|author=Caitlin Dineen|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apple Expo 20060.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Apple Expo 2006 at Hall 5, [[Parc des Expositions de Paris]].]]
The '''Apple Expo''' was a European annual [[sales]] conference and [[technology]] exposition held by [[Apple Inc.]] The conference featured over 250 exhibitors annually, with Apple being its main exhibitor. This conference was most often viewed as the European counterpart to [[MacWorld Expo]], a similar conference that was held annually in San Francisco.

== History ==
The Apple Expo event was originally invented and held in France around 1984 by the employees of the French Apple distributor Seedrin Sarl, and its manager  [[Jean-Louis Gassée]].
All the employees of this small distributor were each time involved in participating for this annual show, where several third party software and hardware distributors would also have their booth. 
Apple Seedrin (which turned to Apple France) continued for decades to organise this event every mid September. Within the small (100 people) Apple France subsidiary, a team was even created (with Adeline Domenjoz) to set up this event. 
Due to the growing size of the event, Reed OIP was contracted for show management.

Around the turn to the 21st century, the Apple corporation took the ownership of the Apple Expo organisation, and Steve Jobs included this recurring date in his possible events list. With this new corporate management, the French subsidiary employees slowly stopped being be part of the booth demo team. 
The last years showed that the event was slowly turning into an iPod expo, more than a Mac one. Year after year, Apple stopped releasing new products during this event, removing much of its booth investments, and limited the amount of available new products on show. 
The last issue was a Reed Expositions-only event, without even an Apple booth.

There were other similar events held in Europe, like [[MacExpo]] in London, but with no link with the Apple Expo.

Below there is a time line of all significant product announcements announced at the Apple Expo: &lt;!-- Still researching the start of the Apple Expo --&gt;

{{buddhism}}
'''Asalha Puja''' (known as '''Asanha Bucha''' in [[Thailand]], {{lang-th|อาสาฬหบูชา}}) is a [[Theravada]] [[Buddhist festival]] which typically takes place in July, on the full moon of the eighth [[lunar month]] (the full moon of Cancer). It is celebrated in [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]] and in countries with Theravada Buddhist populations. Asalha Puja, also known as [[Dharma#Buddhism|Dhamma]] Day, is one of Theravada Buddhism's most important festivals, celebrating as it does the Buddha's first sermon in which he set out to his five former associates the doctrine that had come to him following his enlightenment. This first pivotal sermon, often referred to as “setting into motion the wheel of dhamma,” is the teaching which is encapsulated for Buddhists in the four noble truths: there is suffering ([[dukkha]]); suffering is caused by craving ([[Taṇhā|tanha]]); there is a state ([[nibbana]]) beyond suffering and craving; and finally, the way to nirvana is via [[the eightfold path]].  All the various schools and traditions of Buddhism revolve around the central doctrine of the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]].

This first sermon is not only the first structured discourse given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, it also contains the essence of all his subsequent teaching. At the end of the talk, one of the five participants recounted his understanding of what had been said and asked to be received as a disciple, a request the Buddha granted, thus establishing the first order of monks.

The day is observed by donating offerings to [[wat|temples]] and listening to [[sermon]]s.  The following day is known in Thailand as ''{{lang-th|วันเข้าพรรษา}} [[vassa|Wan Khao Phansa]]''; it is the first day of {{lang-th|พรรษา}} [[vassa]], the Theravada rains retreat.

In Indonesia, this festival is centered at Mendut Temple, near [[Borobudur]].

'''Bank condition''' is a [[random variable]] used to represent the [[probability of failure]] of a bank.  The true probability of failure is unknown to depositors.

[[CAMELS ratings]] in U.S. are intended to reflect the evaluation of regulators and supervisors about bank condition. These evaluations are not publicly released but only given to the bank managers.

The '''Battle of Xiao''' or '''Yao''' ({{zh|t=殽之戰}}) was a battle between [[Qin (state)|Qin]] and [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], both of which were major principality states during the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] of [[Zhou dynasty]]. It occurred in 627 BC at the [[Xiao Mountains]], a branch of the [[Qinling]] Range between [[Yellow River]] and [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]], in modern-day [[Henan province]] of China.

== Before the Battle ==
In 632 BC, the [[Battle of Chengpu]] broke out between [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. Chu was defeated, and the [[Duke Wen of Jin]] became one of [[Five Hegemons|Five Hegemons of Spring and Autumn Period]]. [[Zheng (state)|State of Zheng]] was an ally of Chu, so after the battle, Jin planned to invade Zheng for revenge. In 630, Jin attacked Zheng and besieged its capital city. [[Qin (state)|Qin]] also joined the force of Jin as Duke Mu of Qin was a follower to the Duke Wen of Jin.

[[Zhu Zhiwu]], a person from Zheng, visited [[Duke Mu of Qin]] at night. He told the Duke Mu of Qin that if Zheng was conquered, there would be no benefit to Qin because they did not share a border at that time. On the other hand, Jin would occupy Zheng's territory. It would make Jin stronger and a greater threat to Qin. He pointed out that if Qin gave up attacking the city, Zheng would be willing to be an ally of Qin in the future to potentially fight against Jin. He successfully persuaded Duke Mu of Qin to retreat. Before going back, Duke Mu of Qin appointed three generals to stay at Zheng in order to help Zheng defend their capital city. Since then, the ally between Qin and Jin did not exist any more.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:燭之武退秦師|烛之武退秦师（左传）]]：晉侯、秦伯圍鄭，以其無禮於晉，且貳於楚也。晉軍函陵，秦軍氾南。......夜縋而出。見秦伯曰：「秦、晉圍鄭，鄭既知亡矣。若亡鄭而有益于君，敢以煩執事。越國以鄙遠，君知其難也。焉用亡鄭以陪鄰？鄰之厚，君之薄也。若舍鄭以為東道主，行李之往來，共其乏困，君亦無所害。且君嘗為晉君賜矣，許君焦、瑕，朝濟而夕設版焉，君之所知也。夫晉，何厭之有？既東封鄭，又欲肆其西封。若不闕秦，將焉取之？闕秦以利晉，唯君圖之。」秦伯說，與鄭人盟，使杞子、逢孫、楊孫戍之，乃還。&lt;/ref&gt;

Jin failed to conquer Zheng because of the absence of Qin. Two years later, Duke Wen of Jin died. His son succeed the crown as Duke Xiang of Jin. Meanwhile, state Qin gradually became stronger under Duke Mu's reign. Qin defeated several small states and extended its territory towards Zheng. As Zheng was not so far away anymore, Qin began to think about conquering Zheng. At this time, those three generals stayed with Zheng sent a message to Qin that if the army of Qin attacked Zheng, they would open the northern gate of Zheng's capital city to coordinate with the campaign. &lt;ref&gt;[[s:蹇叔哭師|蹇叔哭師（左传）]]：杞子自鄭使告於秦，曰：「鄭人使我掌其北門之管，若潛師以來，國可得也。」&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jian Shu]], a governor of Qin, disliked the idea of attacking Zheng. He asked Duke Mu to abandon this plan because it might cause potential crisis. However, Duke Mu had made his mind and continued the plan. &lt;ref&gt;[[s:蹇叔哭師|蹇叔哭師（左传）]]：蹇叔曰：「勞師以襲遠，非所聞也。師勞力竭，遠主備之，無乃不可乎！師之所為，鄭必知之；勤而無所，必有悖心。且行千里，其誰不知？」公辭焉，召孟明、西乞、白乙，使出師于東門之外。蹇叔哭之，曰：「孟子！吾見師之出，而不見其入也！」公使謂之曰：「爾何知？中壽，爾墓之木拱矣。」&lt;/ref&gt; In 627 BC, the duke appointed Baili Mengming (son of [[Baili Xi]]), Xi Wi Shu and Bai Yibing as generals to launch a surprise attack to Zheng. To enter the territory of Zheng, Qin army had to pass by the northern gate of [[Luoyang]], the city in which the king of [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] lives. The king of Zhou was regarded as the son of heaven. According to traditional manners, soldiers needed to take off their hamlets when passing by the city of Luoyang. Qin soldiers, however, did not do so. People in the city were astonished, and some people pointed out that Qin soldiers could not win the war because they were too arrogant. &lt;ref&gt;[[s:崤之战|崤之战（左传）]]：三十三年春，秦师过周北门，左右免胃而下，超乘者三百乘。王孙满尚幼，观之，言于王曰：“秦师轻而无礼，必败。轻则寡谋，无礼则脱。入险而脱，又不能谋，能无败乎？”&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the Qin army reached [[Hua (state)|State of Hua]], a hunter from Zheng noticed them. The hunter knew that there was not enough time for him to run back to Zheng to warm everybody, so he decided to fool the Qin army on his own. He paid tribute to generals of Qin in the name of Zheng. After receiving the tribute, generals of Qin thought that Zheng knew they were coming and was well prepared for the war, so they gave up the plan of attacking Zheng. Instead, they conquered Hua and retreated. In reality, Zheng did not know anything about the coming Qin army.

== The battle at Xiao ==
The [[Duke Xiang of Jin]] learned what Qin was trying to do. He was annoyed because he knew that Qin was not only trying to conquer Zheng but also trying to challenge the authority of Jin. To give Qin a lesson, Duke Xiang of Jin allied with the Jiang Rong tribe (a [[Xirong|Rong]] people living in the [[Hanshui|Han River]] valley) to launch a campaign against Qin. They planned to ambush Qin in the Xiao Mountains which was on the route of Qin's retreat. The army of Qin led by those three generals were still retreating from Hua, and they were not prepared to fight against the mighty Jin. These two forces collided at Xiao. Jin army was superior and easily won the battle. Three generals of Qin were all captured by Jin.

After that, Wen Ying, who was a concubine of Duke Wen of Jin, also a daughter of Duke Mu of Qin, entreated Duke Xiang of Jin to release the three generals so that they would be punished in Qin, which was the desire of Duke Mu of Qin as she said. Her entreaty was accepted by Duke Xiang of Jin and the three generals were released and went back to Qin later.

When the Qin army returned, Duke Mu of Qin put on white clothes to wait for them, crying that it was all his fault because he had not listened to Jian Shu's advice. Therefore, the three generals were not punished by Duke Mu of Qin.

As a result of this battle, Jin solidified its status as the most powerful state in northern China for next several decades. Qin suffered a significant loss. About 30,000 men, most of who were elite soldiers in the army, were killed in the battle. For a long period of time after the battle, Qin had no power to continue its eastward expansion. Instead, they turned around and began to expand towards the west. During this process, they clashed with several barbarians and nomadic groups and conquered several smaller states in the west and northwest. The westward expansion helped Qin to build up its power and laid the root for its being a strong state and the [[Qin's wars of unification|eventual unification]] of China.

[[File:California State Fair 2013.jpg|thumb|California State Fair in July 2013]]
The '''California Exposition and State Fair (Cal Expo)''' is an independent state agency established by law in the California Food and Agriculture codes. Cal Expo is governed by an appointed 11-member Board of Directors and daily operations are managed by the chief executive officer (selected by the Board). During the annual [[State_fair|State Fair]] more than 2,000 seasonal temporary employees are hired. The California Exposition is a self-sufficient operation that receives no government funding but still has an estimated economic impact of more than $250 million on the region.

==History==
The [[California State Legislature|California legislature]] created the State Agricultural Society to promote California's reputation for farming and industry.  An agricultural exposition was organized and held in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] in 1854, and California Historic Landmark #861 marks the site. Given that travel was difficult in that era, the next several annual expositions were moved around the state, to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], and [[Marysville, California|Marysville]].

In 1859 the exposition returned to Sacramento, and it was decided that a permanent site should be found. Capitol Park, a six block site bounded by E, H, 20th and 22nd Streets ({{coord|38.580|N|121.477|W}}) was purchased and was home to the state fair for the next fifty years.

Growth in population and attendance forced the purchase of {{convert|80|acre|m2}} just outside the city limits on Stockton Boulevard ({{coord|38.552|N|121.452|W}}), and the first fair was held there in 1909. Continued growth caused that site to be expanded by {{convert|75|acre|m2}} in 1937. During and after [[World War II]], from 1942 to 1947, the Fair was suspended and the fairgrounds were occupied by the [[United States Army|Army]]. During its formative years(1929-1942?), the [[California Highway Patrol]] used some of the State Fair facilities as an unofficial "training academy", later using other state-owned areas in the Sacramento area for training use until the current CHP Academy was opened in 1976.

In 1948, the state purchased approximately 900 acres of undeveloped land along the [[American River]] north of downtown Sacramento.  Funds were not allocated to begin construction on this land until 1963, and the State Fair continued at the Stockton Boulevard grounds until 1967.  In 1968, Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] opened the new "Cal Expo" site, which covers over {{convert|350|acre|km2}} of developed land at {{coord|38.593|N|121.435|W}}.

Cal Expo has seen limited changes over the years. Following the tragic attacks of [[September_11_attacks|9/11]], a memorial plaza was installed in 2002. In 2012, the [[Disneyland Resort]] donated to Cal Expo the iconic 'CALIFORNIA' letters that previously stood in front of [[Disney California Adventure]] from its 2001 opening until 2011. The letters now stand at the entrance to the Expo.

In addition to the annual State Fair, Cal Expo hosts a number of other community, trade and business events, including the annual State Fair Gala (supporting scholarships), Sacramento County Fair, International Sportsman Expo, Western States Horse Expo and a number of other RV, auto and special collectible trade shows.

The one-mile dirt racetrack at Cal Expo hosts live thoroughbred racing during the annual State Fair and live harness racing (September through May), in addition to special events like the Sacramento Mile Auto-race.{{cn|date=June 2015}} The old [[California State Fairgrounds Race Track]] hosted [[USAC National Championship]] races.

===Features===
====''Monorail''====
{{unsourced|section|date=June 2015}}
Cal Expo is home to one of two operating permanent monorail system in California - the only other can be found at Disneyland. The iconic monorail was installed during the creation of its existing grounds in 1968 by Universal Mobility Incorporated. The Monorail ride is only open for public use during the annual State Fair and is a great way to see the grounds from above. The storage facility for the monorail trams are located in the northwest corner of the grounds. Each tram features a different California symbol, like the California Golden Poppy or California Quail.

====''Magnificent Midway''====
{{unsourced|section|date=June 2015}}
Carnival rides and games are operated by [[Butler Amusements|Butler Amusements, Inc.]] Butler Amusements' first year at the state fair was in 2009.  Rides and games were operated by RCS Amusements for a number of years before that.

{{Brexit}}

The '''[[United Kingdom]]'s post-[[Brexit]] relationship with the remaining [[European Union]] members''' could take several forms. A research paper presented to the UK Parliament in July 2013 proposed a number of alternatives to membership which would continue to allow access to the [[European Single Market|EU internal market]]. These include remaining in the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) as a [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) member (alongside [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], and [[Norway]]), or seeking to negotiate bilateral terms more akin to the [[Switzerland–European Union relations|Swiss model]] with a series of interdependent sectoral agreements.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/rp13-42.pdf|title=Leaving the EU&amp;nbsp;– RESEARCH PAPER 13/42|date=1 July 2013|accessdate=19 May 2015|publisher=House of Commons Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exit from the EU without EEA membership or a trade agreement is known as the WTO option.

A transitional arrangement may apply between the time the UK leaves the EU and the coming into force of the final relationship. The report from the first phase of [[Brexit negotiations]] (June to December 2017) mentioned the possibility of agreeing a transitional arrangement during the second phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/joint_report.pdf|title=Joint report from the negotiators of the European Union and the United Kingdom Government on progress during phase 1 of negotiations under Article 50 TEU on the United Kingdom's orderly withdrawal from the European Union|last=|first=|date=8 December 2017|website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK membership of the European Economic Area==
{{main|Membership of United Kingdom in the European Economic Area}}

The UK could seek to continue to be a member of the European Economic Area as a member of EFTA. In January 2017, [[Theresa May]], the [[British Prime Minister]],  announced a 12-point plan of negotiating objectives and said that the UK government would not seek continued membership in the [[European Single Market|single market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/17/theresa-may-brexit-12-point-plan-live/|title=Theresa May confirms Britain will leave Single Market as she sets out 12-point Brexit plan.|last=Wilkinson|first=Michael|date=17 January 2017|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   EEA membership would mean being under existing EU internal market legislation that is part of the [[EEA Agreement]]. Some EU law originates from various international bodies on which non-EU EEA countries have a seat.  EFTA members are free to set their own policies in areas such as [[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]], [[Common Fisheries Policy|fisheries]], [[European Union Customs Union|Customs Union]], [[Common Commercial Policy (EU)|trade]], the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]], direct and indirect taxation and [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters|criminal matters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Basic Features of the EEA Agreement|publisher=European Free Trade Association|url=http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement/eea-basic-features.aspx|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; EEA countries are required to contribute to the [[EU Budget]] in exchange for access to the internal market.&lt;ref name="europequestion"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glencross|first1=Andrew|title=Why a British referendum on EU membership will not solve the Europe question|journal=International Affairs|date=March 2015|volume=91|issue=2|pages=303–17|doi=10.1111/1468-2346.12236|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2346.12236/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EEA EFTA Budget|url=http://www.efta.int/eea/eu-programmes/application-finances/eea-efta-budget|publisher=EFTA|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The UK would be subject to the [[EFTA Court]] rather than the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref name="allenovery.com"&gt;[http://www.allenovery.com/Brexit-Law/Documents/Macro/EU/AO_BrexitLaw_-_EEA_Membership_Jul_2016.PDF] "A&amp;O Legal Opinion on EEA membership"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilateral deals==

==WTO option==
The [[WTO]] option would involve the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without any [[Free Trade Agreement]] and relying on the trading rules set by the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leavehq.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=128|title=What’s wrong with the WTO Option?|first=|last=LeaveHQ|website=leavehq.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[Switzerland–European Union relations|bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the European Union]] are all co-dependent: if one is terminated then all are terminated. Consequently, should Switzerland choose unilaterally to cancel the 'free movement' agreement then all its agreements with the EU will lapse unless a compromise is found. A compromise was reached in December 2016, effectively canceling quotas on EU citizens but still allowing for favorable treatment of Swiss-based job applicants c).&lt;ref name=euobserver22216&gt;[https://euobserver.com/justice/136398 EU and Switzerland agree on free movement] ''[[EUobserver]]'', 22 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
An EU position paper stated: “The Withdrawal Agreement should establish institutional arrangements  to  ensure  the effective management, implementation and  enforcement of the  Agreement.  It should include  appropriate dispute  settlement  mechanisms  regarding  the  application  and  interpretation  of  the Withdrawal Agreement.
The Withdrawal  Agreement should respect the  Union's autonomy. The Withdrawal Agreement should provide that both The Union and the  United Kingdom supervise  the implementation of  the  Withdrawal  Agreement.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/position-paper-transmitted-eu27-governance_en|title=Position paper transmitted to EU27 on Governance|website=European Commission - European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Croatian–Bulgarian Wars''' were a series of conflicts that erupted three times during the 9th and 10th centuries between the medieval realms of '''[[History of Croatia|Croatia]]''' and '''[[History of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]'''. During these wars, Croatia formed alliances with [[Eastern Francia]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] against the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]].

==First war==
[[File:Bulgaria under rule of Boris I.png|thumb|200px|right|Campaigns of [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] (852–889)]]
During the middle of the 9th century, Bulgaria was the dominant power in the central, eastern, and northern Balkans. In 854, the Bulgarian ruler [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] forged an official alliance with the [[Great Moravia|Moravian]] prince [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]] against [[Louis the German]] of [[East Francia]]. Duke [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Trpimir]] of [[Duchy of Croatia|Croatia]] was a faithful [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] [[vassal]] and was wary of Bulgaria's ongoing expansion when it reached Croatian borders after the wars against [[Rascia]]. Bulgaria is said to have invaded Croatia in approximately 854,&lt;ref&gt;De Administrando Imperio&lt;/ref&gt; but there is also a possibility that King Louis gave some compensation to Trpimir to attack [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;К. Грот, Известия о сербах и хорватах, стр. 125—127&lt;/ref&gt; During the war of 854, there was only one great battle on the territory of present-day northeastern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], and neither side emerged victorious. Soon afterward, peace negotiations began between Boris of Bulgaria and Trpimir of Croatia, resulting in gifts exchanged and the establishment of peace, with the border between the [[Duchy of Croatia|Croatian Duchy]] and Bulgaria stabilized at the river of [[Drina]] (between modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republic of Serbia]]).

==Second war==
[[File:Wars of tsar Simeon I.png|thumb|200px|right|Campaigns of [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]](893–927)]]
A very long and arduous war was prosecuted between the Bulgarian [[Tsar]] [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], who wanted to take over the Byzantine Empire, and the Empire's monarch [[Romanos I]]. Under heavy pressure from the Bulgarians and amassing defeat after defeat, the Byzantine Empire negotiated with Serbia and Croatia in an effort to forge an alliance against the Bulgarians. Having been informed of  these plans by Prince [[Michael of Zachlumia]], who was forced to the islands as the Serbian rulers took direct control of most of his local lands for themselves, Simeon overran Serbia in 924,  destroyed it by tricking its nobility, and made it directly part of the Bulgarian Empire. Serbia's ruler Zaharija Pribislavljević fled and found exile at the Croatian court, while after the realm's destruction massive waves of [[Serbs|Serb]] refugees fled and found refuge in [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]]'s Croatia. Trying to gain Croatian entry into this coalition, Romanos I ordered the province of [[Dalmatia]] in ca. 925 to pay taxes not to Byzantium but rather to the Croatian state;&lt;ref&gt;"Tempore Joannis pape sanctissimo consulatu peragente in provincia Croatorum et Dalmatiarum finibus Tamisclao rege et Michael in suis finibus presidente duce" {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Dalmatian territories, including most cities and the northern islands, were henceforth administered by King Tomislav and were to remain under Croatia. Tsar Simeon sent Duke [[Alogobotur]] to drive the Serb refugees further into Croatia, causing outright war in ca. 926.

The climax of the war was the [[Battle of the Bosnian Highlands]] that same year,&lt;ref name=bakalov&gt;Bakalov, ''Istorija na Bǎlgarija'', "Simeon I Veliki".&lt;/ref&gt; when Croatian forces under the command of King Tomislav completely defeated the Bulgarian forces under the command of Alogobotur, killing most of the Bulgarians in the battle. The Croatian victory was so decisive and the battle so big that contemporary sources greatly overestimated Croatia's Army at 160,000 men, with a slightly bigger force on the Bulgarian side.&lt;ref&gt;De Administrando Imperio, 948, Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only battle Tsar Simeon ever lost. Since both rulers maintained good relations with [[Pope John X]], the pope was able to negotiate an end to the war soon afterward without any further border changes. Although the eastern border was extended down to the [[Bosna (river)|river of Bosnia]], the Croatian realm was greatly strengthened both militarily and in natural resources: it emerged from the war as one of the most modern realms of the period and was able to consolidate a moderately sized navy. On the same day as the battle Simeon died in [[Preslav]] and his successor [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]] faced internal difficulties and revolts by his brothers [[Mihail of Bulgaria|Michail]] and Ivan. The Serbs were able to take advantage of this situation and many of them returned by 931 to their homes in the [[Časlav Klonimirović|renewed Serbian realm]], thus terminating Croatia's short-lived Bulgarian neighbor at the east.

==Third war==
In the second half of the 10th century, the Croatian realm was ruled by [[Stjepan Držislav]]. Stjepan formed an alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]], which in turn recognized him as the King of his lands.&lt;ref&gt;Recipiebant enim regie dignitatis insignia ab imperatoribus Constantinopolitanis et dicebantur eorum eparchi siue patritii&lt;/ref&gt; After his death in 997, his son [[Svetoslav Suronja]] continued his pro-Byzantine policy. His brothers [[Krešimir III of Croatia|Krešimir III]] and [[Gojslav of Croatia|Gojslav]] did not want Svetoslav as ruler and attempted a [[coup d'etat]], asking the Bulgarian tsar [[Samuil of Bulgaria|Samuil]] for help. Answering their call, Samuil went on a rampage in 998 and razed the Dalmatian cities of [[Trogir]] and [[Split (city)|Split]], but he was stopped at the [[Siege of Zadar (998)|siege of Zadar]]. The Bulgarian forces then returned home,&lt;ref&gt;[[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]]&lt;/ref&gt; using the Bosnian route. Territory taken by Samuil during the war was given to Krešimir III and Gojslav, who, with further Bulgarian support, won the Croatian [[civil war]] and took over the realm in the year 1000.  Svetoslav Suronja, a Byzantine and Venetian ally, was sent to exile in [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], but after a change in government there he was exiled to [[Hungary]]. Following the death of [[Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria|Ivan Vladislav]] in 1018, Bulgaria fell under Byzantine rule, and Krešimir III and Gojslav, the two Croatian kings, became Byzantine vassals.

'''Earthsong Camps''' (initiated in 2007) are annual weeklong participatory festival camps which occur in Ireland. As of 2012, there are four annual camps: the Harvest Camp, the Dance, Drum and Music Camp, the Stone Circle Camp, and the Healing Drum Camp. The camps' objectives are to model and explore more [[sustainable]] ways of community living, and to live gently on the Earth in a spirit of creativity and fulfilment.

==History==

The first camp, simply called Earthsong, took place in July 2007. Less than twenty people were involved in setting the camp up (now about sixty people are involved annually in organisation and site crew).

==Ethos==

Earthsong aims at nurturing models of sustainable and responsible living. The camps are participatory to a high degree.

==Organisation==

The camps are organised and planned beforehand by the [[Earthsong Core Group]], a team of seven individuals, who also make overarching decisions during camp.

'''Ernest Lalor''' "'''Ern'''" '''Malley''' was a fictitious [[poet]] and the central figure in Australia's most famous [[literary hoax]]. He and his entire body of work were created in one day in 1943 by conservative writers [[James McAuley]] and [[Harold Stewart]] in order to hoax [[Max Harris (poet)|Max Harris]] and his [[Modernism|modernist]] magazine ''[[Angry Penguins]]'', which Harris co-edited with [[John Reed (art patron)|John Reed]] of [[Heide Museum of Modern Art|Heide]], [[Melbourne]]. Imitating the modernist poetry they despised, the hoaxers deliberately created what they thought was bad [[verse (poetry)|verse]] and submitted sixteen poems to ''Angry Penguins'' under the guise of Ethel, Ern Malley's surviving sister. Harris and other members of the [[Heide Circle]] fell for the hoax, and, enraptured by the poetry, devoted the next issue of ''Angry Penguins'' to Malley. The hoax was revealed soon after, resulting in a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' and the humiliation of Harris, who was put on trial, convicted and fined for publishing the poems on the grounds that they contained obscene content. ''Angry Penguins'' folded in 1946.

In the decades that followed, the hoax proved to be a significant setback for modernist poetry in Australia. Since the 1970s, however, the Ern Malley poems, though known to be a hoax, became celebrated as a successful example of [[surrealist poetry]] in their own right, lauded by poets and critics such as [[John Ashbery]], [[Kenneth Koch]] and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]. The poems of Ern Malley are now more widely read than those of his creators, and the affair has inspired works by major Australian writers and artists, such as [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]] and [[Sidney Nolan]]. American poet and anthologist [[David Lehman]] called Ern Malley "the greatest literary hoax of the twentieth century".&lt;ref name=lehman /&gt;

== Background ==
James McAuley and Harold Stewart were both, in 1944, in the Army [[Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs]]. Before the war they had been part of Sydney's [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] arts world. McAuley had acted and sung in [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[revue]]s at [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]]. Both preferred early [[Modernism]] to its later forms. McAuley, for example, claimed that [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]'' (1917) was genius, but the subsequent ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922), regarded by many as Eliot's finest achievement, was an incoherent mess.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Both men lamented "the loss of meaning and craftsmanship" in poetry. They particularly despised the well-funded [[modernism|modernist]] poetry magazine ''Angry Penguins'' and were resentful of the precocious success of [[Max Harris (poet)|Max Harris]], the magazine's founder and editor.

Harris was a 22-year-old ''[[avant-garde]]'' poet and critic in [[Adelaide]], who in 1940, at the age of 18, had started ''Angry Penguins''.&lt;ref name=Malley&gt;{{cite book |last=Malley |first=Ern |title=The Darkening Ecliptic |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[Green Integer]] |date=2017 |isbn=978-1-55713-439-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McAuley and Stewart decided to perpetrate a hoax on Harris and ''Angry Penguins'' by submitting to the magazine nonsensical poetry, which they felt captured the worst of modernist tendencies, under the guise of a fictional poet. They came up with a fictional biography for the poet "Ernest Lalor Malley", who, they claimed, had died the year before at the age of 25. The name is a "highly Australian-sounding handle": "Malley" is a pun on the word ''[[Mallee (habit)|mallee]]'', denoting a class of Australian vegetation and a bird, the native [[malleefowl]], and "Lalor" recalls [[Peter Lalor]], leader of the 1854 [[Eureka Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Heyward, 1993, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in one afternoon, they wrote his entire body of work: 17 poems, none longer than a page, and all intended to be read in sequence under the title ''The Darkening Ecliptic''.

Their writing style, as they described it, was to write down the first thing that came into their heads, lifting words and phrases from the ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'', a ''Collected Shakespeare'', and a ''Dictionary of Quotations'': "We opened books at random, choosing a word or phrase haphazardly. We made lists of these and wove them in nonsensical sentences. We misquoted and made false allusions. We deliberately perpetrated bad verse, and selected awkward rhymes from a ''Ripman's Rhyming Dictionary''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jacketmagazine.com/17/fact2.html|title=Jacket 17 - FACT, June 25, 1944: Ern Malley, Poet of Debunk: full story from the two authors|website=jacketmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also included many bits of their own poetry, though in a deliberately disjointed manner.

The first poem in the sequence, ''Durer: Innsbruck, 1495'', was an unpublished serious effort by McAuley, edited to appeal to Harris:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I had often cowled in the slumbrous heavy air,
Closed my inanimate lids to find it real,
As I knew it would be, the colourful spires
And painted roofs, the high snows glimpsed at the back,
All reversed in the quiet reflecting waters –
Not knowing then that Durer perceived it too.
Now I find that once more I have shrunk
To an interloper, robber of dead men's dream,
I had read in books that art is not easy
But no one warned that the mind repeats
In its ignorance the vision of others. I am still
The black swan of trespass on alien waters.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Brooks (author)|David Brooks]] theorises in his 2011 book, ''The Sons of Clovis: Ern Malley, [[Adoré Floupette]] and a Secret History of Australian Poetry'', that the Ern Malley hoax was modelled on the 1885 satire on French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and the [[Decadent movement]], ''Les Déliquescences d'Adoré Floupette'' by [[Henri Beauclair]] and [[Gabriel Vicaire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/ern-it-turns-out-has-a-french-cousin/story-e6frg8n6-1226145808046 "Ern, it turns out, has a French cousin"] by Don Anderson, ''[[The Australian]]'' (1–2 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart claimed to have never heard of Floupette at the time of the Ern Malley hoax, and while there is no evidence McAuley had, his Masters thesis titled "Symbolism: an essay in poetics", included a study of French Symboliste poetry and poetics.&lt;ref&gt;Heyward, Michael (June 2002).

According to his inventors' fictitious biography, Ernest Lalor Malley was born in Liverpool, England, on 14 March 1918. His father died in 1920, and Malley's mother migrated to [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]], a suburb of Sydney, Australia, with her two children: Ern, and his older sister Ethel. After his mother's death in August 1933, Ern Malley left school to work as an auto mechanic. Shortly after his seventeenth birthday, he then moved to Melbourne where he lived alone and worked as an insurance salesman, and later as a watch repairman. Diagnosed with [[Graves' disease]] sometime in the early 1940s, Malley refused treatment. He returned to Sydney, moving in with his sister in March, 1943, where he became increasingly ill (as well as temperamental and difficult) until his death at the age of 25 on 23&amp;nbsp;July of that same year.

Malley's life as a poet became known only after his sister Ethel (another fictitious creation of McAuley and Stewart) found a pile of unpublished poems among his belongings. These poems featured a brief preface, which explained that they had been composed over a period of five years, but it left no instructions as to what was to be done with them.  Ethel Malley supposedly knew nothing about poetry, but showed the poems to a friend, who suggested that she send the poems to someone who could examine them.&lt;ref&gt;Documentation of Ethel's action and other sources can be viewed online at the [http://jacketmagazine.com/17/index.shtml Ern Malley Feature], ''[[Jacket (magazine)|Jacket]]'' (Sydney), No. 7, June 2002, ed. [[John Tranter]]&lt;/ref&gt; Max Harris of ''Angry Penguins'' was to be that someone.

== Carrying out the hoax ==
McAuley and Stewart then sent Harris a letter, purported to be from Ethel, containing the poems, and asking for his opinion of her late brother's work.

Harris read the poems with, as he later recalled, a mounting sense of excitement. Ern Malley, he thought, was a poet in the same class as [[W. H. Auden]] or [[Dylan Thomas]]. He showed them to his circle of literary friends, who agreed that a hitherto completely unknown modernist poet of great importance had been discovered in suburban Australia. He decided to rush out a special edition of ''Angry Penguins'' and commissioned a painting by [[Sidney Nolan]], based on the poems, for the cover.&lt;ref name=Malley /&gt;

The "Autumn 1944" edition of ''Angry Penguins'' appeared in June 1944 owing to wartime printing delays.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Heywood, ''The Ern Malley Affair'', p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Harris eagerly promoted it around the small world of Australian writers and critics. The reaction was not what he had hoped or expected. An article appeared in the [[University of Adelaide]] student newspaper ridiculing the Malley poems and suggesting that Harris had written them himself in some elaborate hoax.

== The hoax revealed ==
[[File:Max Harris Joy Hester.jpg|thumb|Max Harris with Angry Penguins artist [[Joy Hester]]]]
On 17 June, the Adelaide ''Daily Mail'' raised the possibility that Harris was the hoaxed rather than the hoaxer. Alarmed, Harris hired a private detective to establish whether Ern and Ethel Malley existed or had ever done so. But by now, the Australian national press was on the trail. The next week, the Sydney ''Sunday Sun'', which had been conducting some investigative reporting, ran a front-page story alleging that the Ern Malley poems had in fact been written by McAuley and Stewart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article231696143 |title=Ern Malley, the great poet, or the greatest hoax? |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=2151 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=18 June 1944 |accessdate=17 October 2017 |page=1 (Supplement To The Sunday Sun And Guardian) |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Australian police impounded the issue of ''Angry Penguins'' devoted to ''The Darkening Ecliptic'' on the grounds that Malley's poems were obscene.&lt;ref name=lehman&gt;Lehman D 1998 ''[http://jacketmagazine.com/17/ern-dl.html The Ern Malley Poetry Hoax – Introduction]'' in Jacket No 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ern Malley hoax was on the front pages of the newspapers for weeks, and Harris was humiliated.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

After the hoax was revealed, McAuley and Stewart wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Max Harris and other ''Angry Penguins'' writers represent an Australian outcrop of a literary fashion which has become prominent in England and America. The distinctive feature of the fashion, it seemed to us, was that it rendered its devotees insensible of absurdity and incapable of ordinary discrimination. Our feeling was that by processes of critical self-delusion and mutual admiration, the perpetrators of this humourless nonsense had managed to pass it off on would-be ''intellectuals'' and ''Bohemians'', both here and abroad, as ''great poetry''. [...] However, it was possible that we had simply failed to penetrate to the inward substance of these productions. The only way of settling the matter was by way of experiment. It was, after all, fair enough. If Mr Harris proved to have sufficient discrimination to reject the poems, then the tables would have been turned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McAuley|first1=James|last2=Stewart|first2=Harold|title=Ern Malley, Poet of Debunk: full story from the two authors|url=http://jacketmagazine.com/17/fact2.html|work=Fact|date=25 June 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Immediate impact ==
''Angry Penguins'' soon folded, although the magazine's demise had more to do with a libel case brought against Harris for an unconnected review and the emotional fallout from events in the open marriage of its backers [[John Reed (art patron)|John Reed]] and his wife, [[Sunday Reed|Sunday]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Most people, including most educated people with an interest in the arts, were persuaded of the validity of McAuley and Stewart's "experiment." The two had deliberately written bad poetry, passed it off under a plausible alias to the country's most prominent publisher of modernist poetry, and completely taken him in. Harris, they said, could not tell real poetry from fake, good from bad.

The Ern Malley hoax had long-lasting repercussions. To quote the ''Oxford Companion to Australian Literature'', "More important than the hoax itself was the effect it had on the development of Australian poetry. The vigorous and legitimate movement for modernism in Australian writing, espoused by many writers and critics in addition to the members of the ''Angry Penguins'' group, received a severe setback, and the conservative element was undoubtedly strengthened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ern Malley Hoax |encyclopedia=Oxford Companion to Australian Literature |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |editor1-first=William H. |editor1-last=Wilde |editor2-first=Joy |editor2-last=Hooton |editor3-first=Barry |editor3-last=Andrews |page=257 |isbn=9780195533811 |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195533811.001.0001/acref-9780195533811-e-1133?rskey=cPh5if&amp;result=1133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy over Ern Malley continued for more than twenty years. It spread beyond Australia when it was learned that the British literary critic [[Herbert Read]] had been taken in by the hoax.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Modernist novelists like [[Patrick White]] and abstract painters found themselves tarred with the Ern Malley brush.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Since both McAuley and Stewart and the left-wing nationalist school around [[Vance Palmer|Vance]] and [[Nettie Palmer]] disliked the ''Angry Penguins'' version of modernism with equal venom, though for different reasons, Ern Malley cast a long shadow over Australian cultural life.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In a 1975 interview with [[Earle Hackett]], Sidney Nolan credited Ern Malley with inspiring him to paint his first [[Ned Kelly]] series (1946–47), saying "It made me take the risk of putting against the Australian bush an utterly strange object."&lt;ref name="nolan" /&gt;

== McAuley, Stewart and Harris in later years ==
McAuley went on to publish several volumes of poetry and, with [[Richard Krygier]], founded the literary and cultural journal [[Quadrant (magazine)|''Quadrant'']]. From 1961 he was professor of English at the [[University of Tasmania]]. He died in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pierce, Peter |title=McAuley, James Phillip (1917–1976) Biographical Entry – Australian Dictionary of Biography Online |publisher=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |year=2000 |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150192b.htm |accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart settled permanently in Japan in 1966 and published two volumes of translations of traditional Japanese poetry which became best-sellers in Australia. He died in 1995.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Harris, however, once he recovered from his humiliation in the Ern Malley hoax, made the best of his notoriety. From 1951 to 1955, he published another literary magazine, which he called ''Ern Malley's Journal''. In 1961, as a gesture of defiance, he re-published the Ern Malley poems, maintaining that whatever McAuley and Stewart had ''intended'' to do, they had, in fact, produced some memorable poems. Harris went on to become a successful bookseller and newspaper columnist. His political views moved significantly to the right as he got older (he had been a member of the Communist Party at the time of the hoax), and in the mid-1960s, he claimed to sympathise with McAuley and Stewart's motivations in creating Ern Malley{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. Harris died in 1995.

== Subsequent re-appreciation ==
The fictional Ern Malley achieved a measure of celebrity. The poems are regularly re-published and quoted. There have been at least 20 publications of the ''Darkening Ecliptic'', either complete or partial. It has reappeared – not only in Australia, but in London, Paris, Lyons, Kyoto, New York and Los Angeles – with a regularity that would be the envy of any real Australian poet.&lt;ref name="malley"&gt;Rainey, David. ''Ern Malley: The Hoax and Beyond''. Melbourne: [[Heide Museum of Modern Art]], 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-921330-10-0}}, pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some literary critics take the view that McAuley and Stewart outsmarted themselves in their concoction of the Ern Malley poems. "Sometimes the myth is greater than its creators," Max Harris wrote. Harris, of course, had a vested interest in Malley, but others have agreed with his assessment. [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The basic case made by Ern's defenders was that his creation proved the validity of surrealist procedures: that in letting down their guard, opening themselves to free association and chance, McAuley and Stewart had reached inspiration by the side-door of parody; and though this can't be argued on behalf of all the poems, some of which are partly or wholly gibberish, it contains a ponderable truth... The energy of invention that McAuley and Stewart brought to their concoction of Ern Malley created an icon of literary value, and that is why he continues to haunt our culture.{{Cite quote|date=May 2009}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the "Individual Notes on Works and Authors" in the "Special Collaborations Issue" of [[Locus Solus (journal)|Locus Solus]], [[Kenneth Koch]] wrote, "Though Harris was wrong about who Ern Malley 'was' (if one can use that word here), I find it hard not to agree with his judgment of Malley's poetry."

The American poet [[John Ashbery]] said of Ern Malley, in a 1988 interview in the magazine ''[[Jacket (magazine)|Jacket]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;I think it was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I discovered a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry – which I'd never been able to lay my hands on very much until then – and they had the original edition of ''The Darkening Ecliptic'' with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry – of which there really wasn't very much in English in America at the time – and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course [at Brooklyn College, NY], which I'm always rather hard put to do, since we haven't really studied anything. The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up there is no way of examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem – frequently one of [[Geoffrey Hill]]'s 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud... [the] fraudulent poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jacketmagazine.com/02/jaiv1988.html|title=John Ashbery in conversation with John Tranter New York City, May 1988|date=May 1988|work=[[Jacket (magazine)|Jacket]]|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two exhibitions by major Australian galleries have been based on Ern Malley.  In 1974 the Art Gallery of South Australia’s Adelaide Festival Exhibitions included the Sidney Nolan exhibition "Ern Malley and Paradise Garden".  The 2009 exhibition "Ern Malley: The Hoax and Beyond" at [[Heide Museum of Modern Art]] was the first exhibition to thoroughly investigate the genesis, reception and aftermath of the hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The final irony is enduring fame: Malley is better known and more widely read today than either McAuley or Stewart.

The Australian historian [[Humphrey McQueen]] alluded to the poems in calling his 1979 history of modernism in Australia ''The Black Swan of Trespass''.

Several works of fiction attribute the poems to a third party who actually wrote them; they then fall into the hands of McAuley and Stewart. In 1977 in ''[[Overland (magazine)|Overland]]'', Barbara Ker Wilson wrote a short story "Black Swan of Trespass", in which she has Davydd Davis, who presents as an antipodean [[Dylan Thomas]], writing the poems.

[[Joanna Murray-Smith]]'s play ''Angry Young Penguins'' (1987) is based on these events.

[[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]]'s 2003 novel ''[[My Life as a Fake]]'' draws some of its inspiration from the Ern Malley affair. [[Elliot Perlman]] recounts the tale of the Ern Malley hoax in his 2003 novel ''Seven Types of Ambiguity''. In 2005, ''The Black Swan of Trespass'', a surrealist play about the real life of a fictional Ern Malley by [[Lally Katz]] and Chris Kohn, premiered at the Melbourne [[Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne|Malthouse Theatre]].

In the early years of the 21st century, the artist [[Garry Shead]] produced a series of well-received paintings based on the Ern Malley hoax.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12068">'''Formation dance''' is a style of [[Ballroom dance|ballroom dancing]]. It is pattern or shadow team dancing by couples in a '''formation team'''. The [[choreography]] may be based on a particular dance or a medley of dances. Formation dancing may be done for exhibition or for competition between teams.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Frank and Peggy 1968. ''Come dancing''. Allen, London. Chapter 3, p33.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a type of formation in [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]].

===History===
Formation dancing originated in 1932 in London's Astoria Ballroom. It was Olive Ripman who introduced it under the name "pattern dancing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancesportireland.org/about_dancesport.html History of Dancesport by Dancesport Ireland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106000000/http://www.dancesportireland.org/about_dancesport.html |date=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon it became a competitive dance form.&lt;ref&gt;"Classes and Cultures: England 1918–1951", by Ross McKibbin (2000) {{ISBN|0-19-820855-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xYuoPxzjnXUC&amp;pg=PA405&amp;dq=%22formation+dancing%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=EAueSdTLD46ukASdubi8Cg p. 405]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Formation team contests began in the 1930s in England, and spread to many other countries. International matches have taken place. Formation dances were an important part of the BBC TV program ''[[Come Dancing]]'' when Frank and [[Peggy Spencer]]'s formation teams competed against Constance Millington's team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/articles/2009/02/17/peggy_spencer_20090217_feature.shtml Peggy Spencer Talks to BBC about Starting Formation Dancing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istd.org/news/2008/july08/formationdancing.html ISTD History of Formation]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The peak of popularity was in the 1960s, and is now growing from strength to strength with formation teams from all over the world competing against each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancesport.lv/eng/knowledge/dances/formation.htm "Formation Dancing"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Choreography ===

The choreography of a  formation team includes both [[choreography]] of a [[dancesport]] routine of an individual couple and the overall pattern of movements of the couples on the floor. All couples are expected to follow the beat of the music and movements should be executed simultaneously. Teams are marked on their synchronicity

Latin [[Dancesport]] formation is a medley of dances that include the 5 International Latin dances: [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha Cha]], [[Rhumba|Rumba]], [[Jive (dance)|Jive]], [[Paso Doble]] and [[Samba]]. 

Standard or [[Ballroom]] formation is a medley of the 5 international ballroom dances [[Waltz]], [[Quickstep]], [[Tango (ballroom)|Tango]], [[Viennese Waltz]] and [[Foxtrot]].

The routines generally feature at least some free-form [[choreography]] in the walk on and walk off, which may include movements from [[jazz dance]], [[ballet]], or any other type of dance.  This is clearly marked by a gong.
A complete routine usually lasts a total of 6 minutes.

Formation routines allow dancers to show off their own technique in addition to their ability to move as a team.
Unlike individual competitions tricks such as "round abouts", "chain reactions" form a large section of the choreography.

Shapes (also known as patterns or images) that are an accepted part of choreography are diamonds, squares, diagonals, circles and lines. The routine is judged by the distribution of competitors across the floor, how "readable" the patterns are and the transitions between these patterns.

Specialist formation choreographers include Ona Skaistutė Idzelevičienė,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancesport.lt/zuvedra/en/zuv05.htm Biography of Žuvedra Coach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040509044737/http://www.dancesport.lt/zuvedra/en/zuv05.htm |date=2004-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberto Albanese,&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Roberto Albanese|German Wikipedia Biography of Roberto Albanese]]&lt;/ref&gt; Horst Beer,&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Horst Beer|German Wikepdia Biography of Horst Beer]]&lt;/ref&gt;  and Rachael Holland.

=== Competitions ===

The international governing body is the [[International DanceSport Federation]] (IDSF) (which has [[Olympic sports|Olympic]] recognition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=30 Certificate of Olympic recognition of IDSF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626010044/http://www.idsf.net/index.tpl?id=30 |date=June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Competing teams must be a member of one of its member organisations such as the [[English amateur dancesport association ltd]] (EADA)

The following is a summary of the IDSF rules for European and World Formation competitions.
*Each member country may send 2 formation teams to compete in each of the 2 international styles (Latin and Standard).
*These are selected by national competitions, such as the British National Championships at the [[Blackpool Dance Festival]].
*International competitions have a minimum of 4 countries
*The usual sporting anti-doping rules apply.
*All competitors must be amateurs.
*Each team must contain between 6 and 8 couples.
*In the standard section Men's dress must be black or midnight blue.
*In Latin men may wear coloured shirts but all men must dress the same.
*In standard formation, solo work is restricted to 8 bars. This does not apply in Latin where solo work usually plays a part.
*Lifts are not allowed in the main "judged" part of the routine, but are usually allowed in the walk on and walk off, which is clearly marked by a gong.
*A routine is a maximum of 6 minutes long including entry to and from the floor (a walk on and walk off). Only 4 and a half minutes of this is judged so a gong is used to clearly signify which sections are to be judged.
*Competing teams are judged by those experienced in formation.

In early rounds, judges mark if they believe teams should go through to the next round. In final rounds teams are ranked and the [[skating system]] applies.

Other competitions of note are the [[Blackpool Dance Festival]] and the Donaupokal Invitational Competition [[Vienna]].
Germany is notable in having several leagues of formation teams, and holds several competitions each year.

{{Zandonai operas}}
'''''Francesca da Rimini''''', [[Opus number|Op.]] 4, is an opera in four acts, composed by [[Riccardo Zandonai]], with libretto by [[Tito Ricordi]], (1865–1933), after the play ''[[Francesca da Rimini (play)|Francesca da Rimini]]'' by [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]]. It was premiered at the [[Teatro Regio (Turin)|Teatro Regio]] in Turin on 19 February 1914, and is still staged occasionally.

This opera is Zandonai's best-known work. In the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', Renato Chiesa calls it "one of the most original and polished Italian melodramas of the 20th century, [which] combines a powerful gift for Italian melody ... with an exceptional command of orchestration." Celebrated performers of the title role have included [[Gilda Dalla Rizza]], [[Magda Olivero]] (who recorded excerpts from the opera in 1969, for [[Decca Records]]) and [[Renata Scotto]].

==Synopsis==
The story takes place in [[Ravenna]] and [[Rimini]].

Francesca, daughter of [[Guido I da Polenta]], for state reasons, is to be married to Giovanni, known as Gianciotto, the malformed son of [[Malatesta da Verucchio]]. But as Francesca would certainly refuse to marry the lame and deformed Gianciotto, she is introduced in the first act, by means of a well-laid plot, to his handsome younger brother, Paolo, known as ''Il bello''. Under the impression that Paolo is her destined bridegroom, Francesca falls deeply in love with him at first sight; he also falls passionately in love with her, although they do not exchange a single word.

The next act shows a fight in progress between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], and on the platform of a tower of the [[House of Malatesta|Malatesti]]. Francesca, now married to Gianciotto, meets Paolo and gently reproaches him for the fraud practised on her. He protests his innocence of the plot and reveals his intense passion for her. Gianciotto brings the news of Paolo's election as Captain of the People and Commune of Florence. Paolo departs for Florence.

In the third act Francesca, in her luxurious apartment, is reading the story of [[Lancelot]] and [[Guinevere]] to her women. They then dance and sing in celebration of the advent of Spring, until, on a whispered word from her slave, Francesca dismisses them. Paolo, sick with longing for her, has returned from Florence. He enters; they continue reading the story of Guinevere together, until, no longer in control of their feelings, they let their lips meet in a long kiss.

In the fourth act Malatestino, Gianciotto's youngest brother, who himself lusts for Francesca, has discovered her secret meetings with Paolo. After Francesca refuses to give in to his sexual advances, Malatestino betrays Francesca and Paolo to Gianciotto, who determines to find out the truth for himself. Accordingly, Gianciotto lies in wait outside Francesca's door, and surprising her and Paolo together at early dawn, he slays them both.

The '''future workshop''' is a [[Futures techniques|futures technique]] developed by [[Robert Jungk]], [[Ruediger Lutz]] and [[Norbert R. Muellert]] in the 1970s. It enables a group of people to develop new ideas or solutions of social problems. A future workshop is particularly suitable for participants who have little experience with processes of [[creative decision making]], for example [[child]]ren or [[youth]]. However it is a useful method for any kind of complex problem that requires many stakeholders' involvement. The future workshop method requires an intensive preparation and support by trained moderators. It is used in [[spatial planning]] to involve citizens in the planning process,  in software engineering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A171159&amp;dswid=1063 Hardenborg, Niklas. 2007. "Designing Work and IT Systems: A Participatory Process that Supports Usability and Sustainability" (PhD dissertation). Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis, Uppsala.]&lt;/ref&gt; to create a common vision of the future, and in health care to solve complex and multifaceted problems. 

The method is similar to [[Open Space Technology]], Future Search, [[BarCamp]] or [[Unconference]]s.

Future workshop may also be used as a kind of [[action research]] method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ881790.pdf Åkerblom, Petter. 2005. "Capacity Building for School Gardening: A Swedish Case Study." ''Canadian Journal of Environmental Education'', 10, Spring 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phases == 
# Preparation Phase: the method, its rules and the scheduled course of the workshop (in accordance with the participants) is introduced. 
# Critique phase: The problem is investigated critically and thoroughly. First of all, a visualised brainstorming is performed and a general and critical question concerning the problem is framed. 
# Fantasy or visionary phase: All participants try to work out a vision of the future, to draw a picture of future possibilities.
# Implementation phase: The ideas found are checked and evaluated in regard to their practicability. Discussions are. made related to the first step to make in order to achieve the vision.

The '''Golden Rooster Awards''' ({{zh|s=金鸡奖|p=Jīnjī Jiǎng}}) are awards in [[film]] given in [[mainland China]]. The awards were originally given annually, beginning in 1981. The name of the award came from the [[Rooster (zodiac)|year of the Rooster]] in 1981. Award recipients receive a statuette in the shape of a golden rooster, and are selected by a jury of filmmakers, film experts, and film historians. The awards are given out by the [[China Film Association]].

Originally, Golden Roosters were only available to mainland Chinese nominees, but in 2005, the awards opened up the acting categories to actors from [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], and elsewhere in an effort to compete with Taiwan's [[Golden Horse Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/13/AR2005111300295.html|title=China Challenges Taiwanese Film Awards|publisher = ''The Washington Post'' | author= Associated Press| date=2005-11-13|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the Golden Rooster and the [[Hundred Flowers Awards]] were combined into a single national festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.chinaculture.org/library/2008-01/31/content_127377.htm|title=China Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Film Festival|publisher=ChinaCulture.org|accessdate=2009-01-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012100007/http://www1.chinaculture.org/library/2008-01/31/content_127377.htm|archivedate=2008-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Awards have taken place on alternate years since 2005, with the Golden Rooster taking place on odd years. Films in the past two years are eligible for the Golden Rooster awards since 2007.

The show was presented by fellow ''Britain's Got Talent'' judge [[Piers Morgan]].

==Production==
The show celebrated Boyle's journey from a small village in rural Scotland to international fame and fanfare following her inspiring performance on "Britain’s Got Talent," the British reality competition series executive produced by Simon Cowell that rocketed Susan Boyle to superstardom.

''“Susan Boyle is one of those rare personalities who has captivated millions of fans around the world with her undeniable vocal talent and incredible life story,” said Ryan O’Hara, President of TV Guide Network and TVGuide.com. “For the first time ever, fans will have an opportunity to see Susan Boyle shine on stage in her own spotlight, witness amazing musical performances in a concert setting, as well as gain insight into the challenges she overcame as she rose to an international phenomenon.”''

A co-production between [[talkbackTHAMES]], the UK production company owned by FremantleMedia, and Simon Cowell’s Syco TV, "I Dreamed a Dream: The Susan Boyle Story" will include exclusive interviews with Susan, friends and celebrity fans such as [[Simon Cowell]], alongside spectacular performances with special guests and other surprises. Susan will premiere songs from her new CD including, "[[Cry Me a River (1953 song)|Cry Me a River]]" and the Rolling Stones classic "[[Wild Horses (The Rolling Stones song)#Susan Boyle version|Wild Horses]]" as well as a very special performance of the song that launched her to global superstardom; "I Dreamed A Dream," with the London West End cast of Les Misérables.

Produced by [[Steve Mac]], ‘I Dreamed A Dream’ features her signature songs, "I Dreamed A Dream" and "Cry Me A River." The album also includes a haunting rendition of Rolling Stones’ "Wild Horses," Madonna’s "You’ll See," The Monkees’ ‘Daydream Believer,’ and "Who I Was Born To Be," an original recording written specially for Susan. Susan enthused: "It was my greatest ambition to release an album and I have finally achieved it. There is happiness out there for everyone who dares to dream."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NetNewsPublisher |url=http://www.netnewspublisher.com/i-dreamed-a-dream-the-susan-boyle-story-to-air-on-tv-guide-network/ |title=I Dreamed a Dream: The Susan Boyle Story to Air on TV Guide Network |publisher=: |date= |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guests==

The Indiana Black Expo Summer Celebration is the largest ethnic–cultural event in the [[United States]]. This ten-day event, held in the [[Indiana Convention Center]] as well as various places around Indianapolis, draws [[African American]]s to Indianapolis from both around the state and around the country. First organized in 1970, the Black Expo has provided networking, educational, career, and cultural opportunities for its guests. Participation at the 2006 Summer Celebration reached record highs, with over 350,000 in attendance.

Since 1983, Indiana Black Expo has hosted the [[Circle City Classic]], a two-day event held the first weekend in October which includes a parade as well as its main attraction, a college football game held between two historically black colleges and universities ([[HBCU]]s).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6572">[[File:International-Childrens-Festival.jpg|right]]The '''International Children's Festival at Wolf Trap''' was a youth-oriented festival dedicated to the performing, visual, and interactive arts. The festival is held each September at [[Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts]] in [[Fairfax County]], [[Virginia]], which is the United States' only national park devoted solely to the performing arts. First conceived in 1971 as "International Children's Day", the festival provides opportunities for children to share aspects of their culture through the arts. The founder of the Wolf trap National Park for Performing Arts, [[Catherine Filene Shouse]], also originated the festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolf-trap.org/Learn_About_Wolf_Trap/Founder.aspx Biography of Catherine Filene Shouse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518104623/http://www.wolf-trap.org/Learn_About_Wolf_Trap/Founder.aspx |date=2008-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Children's Festival is sponsored by the Arts Council of [[Fairfax County]] in cooperation with the Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts and the [[National Park Service]]. Proceeds from the annual festival support the educational programs and services of the Arts Council of Fairfax County. It is held annually in September, typically on the 3rd weekend of the month.  By the end of 2011, it was decided to conclude the tradition, amid financial issues.

==Performances==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:International-childrens-festival-india-2008.png|thumb|right|Festival performer]] --&gt;The two-day weekend festival features many performers from several countries in musical and dance performances in four stages representative of their cultural heritage. The performers are dressed in traditional clothing and play many traditional songs which they dance to. Also featured are an Arts and Technology Pavilion with hands-on technology stations, international experiential tents where attendees can meet the international performers, learn the moves they saw on stage, and participate in craft projects to help them learn about international culture, and the Creative Kids Workshop featuring pavilions for hands-on arts projects and an instrument petting zoo.

== Curriculum ==
An educational curriculum co-developed by the Arts Council of Fairfax County and Fairfax County Public Schools supports the learning opportunities available to students at the International Children's Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsfairfax.org/index.php?/festival/for_educators/ Arts Council of Fairfax County page for educators]&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum is directed toward fifth grade classes and is also available for home-school and private school programs.

Each year since 1994 the Festival has been the designated fine arts field trip for the entire 5th grade population in [[Fairfax County Public Schools]] – resulting in over 13,000 students coming to Wolf Trap during the week to see and meet the featured performers. The year 2001 was a particularly interesting year for the festival as thousands of students were en route to Wolf Trap when the events of [[September 11, 2001]] took place.&lt;ref&gt;
In 1995, Oklahoma City University was asked to assemble a children’s choir to represent OK just months after The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing. Under the direction of Dr. Stephen Coker, the OKC Metropolitan Children’s Choir performed classical, spiritual and folk songs, including their state song, Oklahoma!
[http://www.aasa.org/publications/execprespectdetail.cfm?ItemNumber=10682 Crisis Skills of September Past]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community involvement==
The Festival includes not only the featured international performers, but also dozens of Fairfax County and Washington DC metropolitan area arts organizations. In total, the festival features over 400 area performing and visual artists representing a diverse range of art forms, genres, and cultures. With the assistance of the community, each year free tickets, gifts, and snacks are provided to nearly 2,000 Washington DC area children and their families who would otherwise be unable to attend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internationalchildrensfestival.com/ International Children's Festival website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Children's Festival relies on over 3,500 volunteer hours from 700 volunteers from local corporations and service organizations. Volunteers for the actual festival must be at least 16 years of age and available to work a 3.5 hour shift.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsfairfax.org/index.php?/festival/volunteer/ International Children's Festival Volunteer Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

For over 15 years [[Bob McGrath]] from [[Sesame Street]] acted as host and consultant to the International Children's Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobmcgrath.com/mcgrath.htm Bob McGrath Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127200053/http://www.bobmcgrath.com/mcgrath.htm |date=2007-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Physics Olympiad''' ('''IPhO''') is an annual [[physics]] competition for high school students. It is one of the [[International Science Olympiad]]s.  The first IPhO was held in [[Warsaw]], Poland in 1967.

Each national delegation is made up of at most five student competitors plus two leaders, selected on a national level. Observers may also accompany a national team.  The students compete as individuals, and must sit for intensive theoretical and laboratory examinations. For their efforts the students can be awarded gold, silver, or bronze medals or an honourable mention.

The theoretical examination lasts 5 hours and consists of three questions.  Usually these questions involve more than one part.  The practical examination may consist of one laboratory examination of five hours, or two, which together take up the full five hours.

== History ==
[[Image:IPhO-2018 07-22 opening-audience.jpg|thumb|Students at the opening ceremony of the 2018 IPhO in Portugal]]
[[Image:IPhO-2018 07-28 singapore-rawat.jpg|thumb|Singaporean IPhO team with the current IPhO president Rajdeep Singh Rawat]]
Several months before the first IPhO took place in 1967, invitations were sent to all the [[Central Europe]]an countries. The invitations were accepted by [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Communist Romania|Romania]] (five countries including [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], the organiser of the competition). Each team consisted of three secondary school students accompanied by one supervisor. The competition was arranged along the lines of the final stage of the Polish Physics Olympiad: one day for theoretical problems and one day for carrying out an experiment. One obvious difference was that the participants had to wait for the scripts to be marked. During the waiting period the organisers arranged two excursions by plane to [[Kraków]] and to [[Gdańsk]]. At the first IPhO the students had to solve four theoretical problems and one experimental problem.

The second Olympiad was organised by Prof. Rezső Kunfalvi in [[Budapest]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], in 1968. Eight countries took part in that competition. The [[German Democratic Republic]], the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] joined the participating countries. Again, each country was represented by three secondary school students and one supervisor. Some time before the second IPhO a preliminary version of the Statutes and the Syllabus were produced. Later these documents were officially accepted by the International Board consisting of the supervisors of the teams that participated in the competition. This took place during a special meeting organised in [[Brno]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], several months after the second IPhO.

The third IPhO was arranged by Prof. Rostislav Kostial in [[Brno]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], in 1969. On that occasion each team consisted of five students and two supervisors. The competition in Brno was organised according to the official Statutes accepted earlier.

The next Olympiad took place in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]], in 1970. Each country was represented by six students and two supervisors. During that Olympiad several small changes were introduced into the Statutes.

Since the fifth IPhO, held in [[Sofia]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], in 1971, each team has consisted of five pupils and two supervisors. In 1978 and 1980, the IPhO was not organized. This was due to the accession of the Western countries. The first western country to participate was [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jyu.fi/tdk/kastdk/olympiads/history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the few Western countries participating declined to accept the principle that the IPhO be organized every second year in a [[Western bloc|Western]] and [[Eastern bloc]] country. Thus the Eastern block countries declined from organising the 1978 and 1980 olympiads. From 1982 onwards, the yearly competition was resumed as there were enough participating Western countries to share the load. At present, the venue of the Olympiad is decided for years ahead. After accession into IPhO, every country must notify the others within three years about its willingness to host the IPhO. After this, the country is placed on a waiting list which as of 2006 stretches well into the 2050s. The failure to organize the IPhO on turn will lead to temporary expulsion from the IPhO. This happened to [[France]] in 1986.

== Structure of the competition ==

The competition lasts for two days. One day is devoted to theoretical problems (three problems involving at least four areas of physics taught in secondary schools, total number of marks is 30). Another day is devoted to experimental problems (one or two problems, total number of marks 20). These two days are separated by at least one day of rest. On both occasions the time allotted for solving the problems is five hours. Each team consists of students from general or technical secondary schools (not colleges or universities) or have graduated but are yet to enter university, and must be under the age of 20. Typically each team consists of five students (pupils) and two supervisors. Smaller teams may also participate(consisting 4 or less students with 1 supervisors).

== Distribution of medals ==

The minimal scores required for Olympiad medals and honourable mentions are chosen by the organizers according to the following rules: A gold medal should be awarded to the top 8% of the participants. A silver medal or better should be awarded to the top 25%. A bronze medal or better should be awarded to the top 50%. An honourable mention or better should be awarded to the top 67%. All other participants receive certificates of participation. The participant with the highest score (absolute winner) receives a special prize, in addition to a gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jyu.fi/tdk/kastdk/olympiads/statutes.html Statutes of the International Physics Olympiads]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacco Macacco''' was a fighting ape or monkey who was exhibited in [[monkey-baiting]] matches at the [[Westminster Pit]] in [[London]] in the early 1820s. He achieved some measure of fame among the sporting community through his reputed prodigious record of victories against dogs, but was brought to wider attention by depiction in popular literature, artworks and by citation in speeches to Parliament by the animal welfare campaigner [[Richard Martin (Irish politician)|Richard Martin]]. Jacco's most famous fight, against the equally well-known bitch Puss, seems to have marked the end of his career: he may have died as a result of injuries received during the match or of an unrelated illness sometime afterwards. His ashes are housed at the True Crime Museum in [[Hastings, East Sussex]].

==History==
[[File:Jacco1.jpg|thumb|right|''Tom and Jerry sporting their Blunt on the phenomenon monkey Jacco Macacco at the Westminster-Pit'' (1821) by [[George Cruikshank|George]] and [[Isaac Robert Cruikshank]]]]
[[File:Jacco3.JPG|thumb|right|''The Westminster-Pit: A Turn-up between a Dog and Jacco Macacco, the Fighting Monkey''&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Sutherland's 1826 aquatint from an 1822 original by [[Henry Thomas Alken]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sutherland's version omits the large bloodstain spreading across the floor of the pit which Alken had included in the [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_image.aspx?objectId=1545323&amp;partId=1&amp;asset_id=349078 original print].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Most details on Jacco&lt;ref group="note"&gt;His name is seen with many spelling variations: "Jaco Macacco", "Jacco Macauco" "Jacko Macaco" etc.&lt;/ref&gt; come from second-hand or fictionalized accounts.  In ''Pictures of Sporting Life and Character'' (1860), [[William Pitt Lennox]] gives a detailed account of Jacco's career: he was landed at Portsmouth where he fought dogs in a number of local sporting arenas before being purchased by a London sporting impresario and transported to Hoxton from where he continued his career, fighting in the Chick Lane and Tottenham Court Road pits, and earned one of his monikers as the "Hoxton Ape". Lennox writes that after biting his owner he was sold to the proprietor of the Westminster Pit, Charles Aistrop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

| location = London
| pages = 3
| date = 5 January 1829
| accessdate = 22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Aistrop's name is also seen with a variety of other spellings, such as Eystropp, Eastup, Eastrop, Eastop and even Westrop.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was already somewhat famous, at the Westminster Pit Jacco's fights began to attract spectators from the higher reaches of society and considerable wagers were placed on his fights.&lt;ref name="Lennox"&gt;Lennox pp. 162-7&lt;/ref&gt;
Aistrop gave a somewhat different account of Jacco's history. In a statement published in 1825 he claimed that Jacco had belonged to a sailor who had kept him for three years. Jacco had always been very calm but one day suddenly became aggressive over a saucer of milk and lacerated three of the sailor's fingers. The sailor had sold him to a silversmith called Carter from Hoxton. Carter had taught Jacco many tricks, but because the ape was extremely aggressive Carter had to purchase a large sheet of iron to use as a shield whenever he approached him. Carter finally tired of Jacco's constant attempts to attack him and took the ape into a nearby field where he set a dog on him. Jacco defeated both this dog and a second dog, and was then matched against a dog bred for fighting at Bethnal Green. When he also defeated this dog, his reputation began to grow and a fight was fixed for him at the Westminster Pit. Reputable historians frequently point to this fight as the first documentable episode of exacting what later came to be referred to as "monkey justice." &lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite news | work=Morning Chronicle | date=15 March 1825 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Trusty", one of the earliest examples of a [[Bull and Terrier]], was renowned around 1805, so his career would have not have overlapped with Jacco either.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierce Egan]] also wrote about a battle between the "monkey phenomenon" and a dog in his popular account of the adventures of the characters Tom and Jerry in various sporting venues, ''Scenes from London Life''.&lt;ref name="Egan"&gt;Egan pp. 177-84&lt;/ref&gt; Although Egan's account of Tom and Jerry's visit to the Westminster Pit to see the fight between Jacco and the dog is detailed and is accompanied by a fine print by [[George Cruikshank]], it is a humorous fiction and even though it may be based on real events it is impossible to judge how accurate the record of the fight is.

It appears that there was at least one contest between Jacco and the equally renowned white [[Bull and Terrier]] bitch, Puss, who belonged to the former prizefighter [[Tom Cribb]]. The various accounts of the fight and its outcome appear contradictory: the two animals may have been matched more than once, so reports may be from different fights. Aistrop puts the date of the contest as 13 June 1821.&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt; Lennox gives the terms of the fight on which he reports as a wager of fifty pounds that Puss could either kill Jacco or last five minutes with him (almost double the length of time which any of Jacco's previous opponents had managed) and reported Jacco as the victor though he did not record the eventual fate of the dog.&lt;ref name="Lennox" /&gt; [[Thomas Landseer]] produced an etching from his own sketch of ''Fight between Jacko Maccacco a celebrated Monkey and Mr Tho. Cribbs well known bitch Puss'' which shows the two combatants locked together tearing at one another's throats.

[[Richard Martin (Irish politician)|Richard Martin]], the MP for Galway who was known as "Humanity Dick" for his philanthropy and constant attempts to introduce legislation improve the treatment of animals, gave an impassioned speech to Parliament in 1822 when introducing a bill to prevent the mistreatment of horses, cattle and sheep (his earlier attempt in 1821 had been defeated in the Lords). He claimed that he had seen a bill advertising a fight between Jacco and Puss:

{{quote|text=Jacco Macacco, the celebrated monkey, will this day fight Tom Crib's white bitch, Puss. Jacco has fought many battles with some of the first dogs of the day, and has beat them all, and he hereby offers to fight any dog in England of double his own weight.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips pp.167-8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The result, according to Martin, was that after the fight had gone on for half an hour the dog had its carotid artery severed and Jacco's jaw had been torn away causing the death of both animals within two hours. Martin's bill passed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ryder | first = Richard D. |title= Martin, Richard (1754–1834) |journal= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | volume = 1 | origyear = 2004 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18207 | accessdate = 22 October 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/18207 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Protected by [[Parliamentary privilege]], he could not be accused of lying, but opponents managed to discredit some of his claims of acts of cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips p.183&lt;/ref&gt; Martin also revised his own account of the outcome of Jacco and Puss's match when he used the fight as an example of cruelty in an 1824 speech, claiming that the dog had been killed, but although the monkey's jaw had been torn away he had not been humanely dispatched but "allowed to languish in torment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news
| title = Court of Chancery

| pages = 4

| accessdate = 22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin's version of Jacco's death was disputed by the owner of the Westminster Pit who claimed that Jacco had dealt with Puss in two and a half minutes (although he had not injured her fatally)  and had died 15 months later of an unrelated illness. According to Aistrop, Jacco was then stuffed and sold to a Mr Shaw of Mitchum Common, which would have been impossible if the monkey's jaw was torn away.&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt;  An account from [[George Charles Grantley Fitzhardinge Berkeley]] in ''My Life and Recollections'' also contradicted Martin's tale. Berkeley stated that he had attended the pit on the night of the match and had seen Tom Cribb cradling the dog's head in a suspicious manner before the fight began. When the dog was turned loose it immediately latched onto the monkey and gave Jacco no opportunity to fight back. Despite this the dog had appeared to be bleeding and slowly weakened. Cries from the audience eventually led to the contest being declared a draw and the two combatants were separated. Berkeley realised that Cribb had cut the dog before releasing it and this was confirmed by the unrepentant Cribb who claimed that it was for the purposes of giving the audience a good show.&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;Berkeley pp.100-3&lt;/ref&gt; There is a possibility that the two animals fought twice: a extant poster from 1821 advertised a match between Jacco and a 19-pound bitch that was to take place on 27 November 1821 and referred to a match between Jacco and Puss that had already taken place.

==Record and fighting style==
[[File:Jacco broadsheet.png|right|thumb|upright|An 1821 advertising broadsheet for a match between Jacco and a 19-pound bitch.&lt;br /&gt; Although Jacco's fight was the headline, the event also featured [[dog fighting|dog fights]], [[badger-baiting]] and the Westminister Pit's renowned [[bear-baiting|bear]].]]
Jacco was reported to weigh {{convert|10|to|12|lb|kg}} and was pitched against dogs of up to twice his weight. The 1821 advertising broadsheet for his match against the {{convert|19|lb|kg}} bitch states he was open to challenges from "any dog in England for 100 Guineas of 24lbs being double his own weight".&lt;ref name="B1821"&gt;1821 broadsheet&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lennox:
{{quote|text=His mode of attack, or rather of defence, was, at first, to present his back or neck to the dog, and to shift and tumble about until he could lay hold on the arm or chest, when he ascended to the windpipe, clawing and biting away, which usually occupied him about one minute and a half, and if his antagonist was not speedily with drawn, his death was certain; the monkey exhibited a frightful appearance, being deluged with blood&amp;nbsp;— but it was that of his opponent alone; as the toughness and flexibility of his own skin rendered him impervious to the teeth of the dog.&lt;ref name="Lennox"/&gt;}}

Lennox writes that after several fights, Jacco adapted his technique and would overcome his canine opponents by leaping directly on their backs and manoeuvring himself into a position where he could tear at their windpipes while remaining out of reach of their jaws. Lennox reports him as having overcome fourteen opponents in total and the advertising broadsheet states he had already been involved in thirteen matches "with some of the best dogs of the day including his combat with the wonderful bitch Puss of T. Cribbs and the famed Oxford one".&lt;ref name="B1821" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Wingfield writes in his novel that Jacco had beaten nine opponents at the time of the match with Belcher's dog.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Berkeley and [[Lawrence Fitz-Barnard]] (writing in ''Fighting Sports'' in 1922) cast doubt on Jacco's ability to beat any canine opponent in an un-rigged match though. Berkeley points to the bleeding of the dogs by Cribb and stresses the tendency of writers to exaggerate their accounts of simian ferocity and strength,&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt; while Fitz-Barnard dismisses out-of-hand the possibility of any but the largest apes being able to prevail against a fighting dog. Fitz-Barnard claims that Jacco was a "stock performer and put up a great battle with an indifferent dog. The monkey was given a club to assist him..."&lt;ref&gt;Fitz-Barnard p.191&lt;/ref&gt; Most accounts agree that Jacco was held in a small cage when not fighting and was secured by a short length of thin metal chain during his matches.&lt;ref name="Egan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt;

==Identification==
Which species of monkey or ape Jacco belonged to is unknown. Lennox initially describes him as coming from Africa, but later writes that he belonged to the Asian [[gibbon]] family:
{{quote|text=Jacko was of that species of ''Simiae'' denominated the Gibbon, which sit with their forepaws upon the ground; he was of a cinerous or ashy colour, with black fingers and muzzle. ... In appearance he was neither old nor ugly.&lt;ref name="Lennox" /&gt;}}

Egan describes him as the "famed Italian monkey",&lt;ref name="Egan" /&gt; Umberto Cuomo writing in ''Il Bulldog'' in 2002 says he was probably a [[mandrill]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuomo p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Before Aistrop had acquired Jacco, he had featured a [[baboon]] at the Westminster Pit in an attempt to capitalise on Jacco's growing fame, but, according to Lennox, this had only served to emphasise Jacco's skill by comparison.&lt;ref name="Lennox" /&gt; Neither the Cruikshanks' aquatint nor Henry Aitken's depiction of Jacco fighting an unidentified opponent are detailed enough to identify Jacco's species, even if they are taken from life (the Cruickshanks are more interested in depicting the spectators than in the accuracy of the depiction of the monkey).&lt;ref&gt;Arnold p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Landseer's etching shows Jacco with a short tail and is annotated with "...from a sketch made at the time by himself", so it is liable to be the most accurate of the illustrations of Jacco. Aistrop described Jacco as "canine mouthed and much larger than the common monkey".&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt;

The term Macacco was in use as a general term for a monkey at the time; it came from the Portuguese ''macaco'' meaning "monkey," a derivative of a Bantu word that had been exported to Brazil where it was used to describe various type of monkey in the 17th century. As different authors applied the term to different species it is difficult to know which species, genus or family was meant.&lt;ref&gt;Denham p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Macaca was given as a name to a widespread [[genus]] of Old World monkeys (the [[macaques]]) in 1799. Jaco was the specific name for a lemur and the term "Macauco" was also in general use to mean lemur, but there is no suggestion that Jacco was a lemur&amp;nbsp;— Lennox specifically discounts this, and credits Jacco's forename as deriving from the "Jolly Jack Tars" that transported him to England and first observed his fighting abilities. Jacco's fame may have been associated with the rise of a Cockney slang word for a monkey "Murkauker" in the middle of the 19th century (although this was already obsolete by the 1890s),&lt;ref&gt;Farmer p.391&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partridge p.601&lt;/ref&gt; and "Jacco Macacco" itself was at least sometimes used as a generalised term for a monkey at the same period.{{sfn|Ben George, ed|1896}} Aistrop claimed that the sailor that had originally owned him had taken him from the "Isle of Maccacco".&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt;

'''Karam''' is the worship of Karam-Devta (Karam-Lord/God), the god of power, youth, and youthfulness. The Karam festival is an agricultural festival celebrated by diverse groups of people, including: the [[Khortha language|Khortha]], Korba , [[Nagpuri people|Nagpuri]], [[Kurmali language|Kurmali]], [[Sambalpuri language|Sambalpuri]], [[Kurukh people|Oraon]], [[Munda people|Munda]], [[Kharia people|Kharia]] and [[Santal people|Santal]] . The festival is held on the 11th day of a full moon ([[Purnima]]) of the Hindu month of Bhado (Bhadra), which falls between August and September. Groups of young villagers go to the jungle and collect wood, fruits, and flowers. These are required during the [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] (worship) of the Karam God. During this period, people sing and dance together in groups. The entire valley dances to the drumbeat "day of the phases".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jharkhand.gov.in/festivals |title=Festivals : Official Website of Government of Jharkhand |publisher=Jharkhand.gov.in |date=2016-04-13 |accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odishatourism.gov.in/portal/Festivals/TribalFestivals/KaramaFestival.aspx |title=Karama Festival |publisher=Odishatourism.gov.in |date=2014-02-21 |accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of the ritual==
In the ritual, people go to the jungle accompanied by groups of drummers and cut one or more branches of the [[Neolamarckia cadamba|Karam]] tree. The branches are usually carried by unmarried, young girls who sing in praise of the deity. Then the branches are brought to the village and planted in the center of the ground which is plastered with cow-dung and decorated with flowers. A tribal priest (Jhankar or Dehuri) offers germinated grains and liquor in [[propitiation]] to the deity who grants wealth and children. A fowl is also killed and the blood is offered to the branch. The tribal priest then recites a legend to the villagers about the efficacy of Karam puja. The legend varies from tribe to tribe.

==Details==
The Karam festival is celebrated usually on Bhado Ekadashi, on the eleventh day of the bright full moon (Purnima) of the month of Bhado (August–September). The Karam tree, scientifically named ''Nauclea Parvifolia'' is the center of the proceedings of the festival. The preparations for the Karam festival begin around ten or twelve days before the festival.

The morning of the Karam festival begins with women pounding rice in the [[dheki]], a wooden implement, to obtain rice flour. This rice flour is used to make a local tribal delicacy which can be sweet as well as salty. This delicacy is cooked in the morning of the Karam festival for consumption, and shared throughout the neighborhood.

Then the people begin the [[Karma Naach|ritual dance]] with a yellow bloom tucked behind their ear. A branch of the Karam tree is carried by the Karma dancers and passed among them while they are singing and dancing. This branch is washed with milk and rice beer (locally known as [[hariya]]). Then, the branch is raised in the middle of the dancing arena. After reciting the legend - the story behind the worshiping of Karam (Nature/God/Goddess) - all the men and women drink liquor and spend the entire night singing and dancing; both are essential parts of the festival.

Women dance to the beat of drums and folk songs (''siring''). The [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] is followed by a community feast and the drinking of hariya. The next day, the Karam tree is sprinkled with curd of the seas and immersed in the river bed.&lt;ref&gt;Kislaya, Kelly (9 September 2011) [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/Songs-dance-and-hadia-usher-in-Karma-Puja/articleshow/9921512.cms?from=mdr Songs, dance and hadia usher in Karma Puja]. Times of India&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Karam is a festival of sisterhood, friendship, and cultural unity. The festival also has a close link to nature. Tribes worship trees during this festival as they are a source of livelihood, and they pray to mother nature to keep their farmlands green and ensure a rich harvest. It is believed that the worship for good germination increases the fertility of grain crops. Karam/Karma Devta/Karam Deviis (the God of power, youth and youthfulness) is worshiped during the festival. The devotees keep a day-long fast and worship the branches of karam/kadam and [[Shorea robusta|sal]]. Girls celebrate the festival for welfare, friendship and sisterhood by exchanging a jawa flower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indroyc.com/2012/09/26/karma/ Karma — a Festival of Jharkhand | Indrosphere]. Indroyc.com (26 September 2012). Retrieved on 2015-09-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story behind the celebration==
There are multiple versions of the story behind the origin of Karam Puja. Anthropologist Hari Mohan writes that after the rituals are over, the karam story is narrated to boys and girls. The story behind the festival, according to Mohan, is this:&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, Hari (1973) ''The Chero: A study in acculturation''.  Bihar Tribal Welfare Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once upon a time there were seven brothers who labored hard at agriculture work. They had no time even for lunch; therefore, their wives carried their lunches to the field daily. Once it so happened that their wives did not bring the lunches for them. They were hungry. In the evening they returned home and found that their wives were dancing and singing near a branch of the karam tree in the court yard. This made them angry, and one of the brothers lost his temper. He snatched the karam branch and threw it into the river. The karam deity was insulted; as a result, the economic condition of their family continued to deteriorate and they were brought to the point of starvation. One day a Brahman (priest) came to them, and the seven brothers told him the whole story. On hearing it, the Brahman told them that the Karam Rani was angry and she must be appeased. If it was not done their condition would further deteriorate, the Brahman told them. The seven brothers then left the village in search of the Karam Rani. They kept on moving from place to place and, one day, they found the karam tree. Subsequently, they worshiped it and their economic condition began to improve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jharkhandstatenews.com/uprooting-the-trees-in-a-festive-waythe-story-of-karam-rani/#.VgYIRNKqqko Uprooting the trees in a festive way;The Story of karam Rani]. Jharkhand State News. Retrieved on 27 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the [[Bhumij]] and the Orans the legend is that there were seven brothers living together. The six oldest used to work in the field and the youngest stayed at home. He was indulging in dance and songs round a karam tree in the courtyard with his six sisters-in-law. One day, they were so engrossed in dance and song that the brothers' morning meal was not carried to the field by the wives. When the brothers arrived home, they became agitated and threw the karam tree into a river. The youngest brother left home in anger. Then evil days fell on the remaining brothers. Their house was damaged, the crops failed, and they virtually starved. While wandering, the youngest brother found the karam tree floating in the river. Then he propitiated the god, who restored everything. Thereafter he returned home and called his brothers and told them that because they insulted Karam Devta, they fell on evil days. Since then the Karam Devta has been worshipped.

Another legend prevalent among the Pauri Bhuiyans is that a merchant returned home after a very prosperous voyage. His vessel was loaded with precious metals and other valuables which he had brought from distant lands. He waited in the vessel to be ceremoniously received by his wife and relatives, as was the custom. As it was the day of the Karama festival, all the women were engrossed with dancing and the men with playing the drums, so no one came to receive him. The merchant became furious with them. He uprooted the karam tree and threw it away. Then the wrath of Karam Devta fell on him. His vessel immediately sank in the sea. The merchant consulted astrologers who told him to propitiate Karam Devta. He launched another vessel, set out in search of the deity, and found him floating in the sea. He propitiated him with great devotion and all his wealth was restored. From that day on, the annual festival of Karam Puja has been held. After spending the whole night with dance and songs, the people uproot the branches and carry them to nearby rivers or rivulets for immersion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odishatourism.gov.in/portal/Festivals/TribalFestivals/KaramaFestival.aspx Karama Festival].

The '''Knox Mine disaster''' was a [[mining accident]] on January 22, 1959, that is widely credited with single-handedly killing the mining industry in the [[Coal Region|Northern Anthracite Region]] of Pennsylvania.{{how|date=October 2018}}&lt;!-- not explained in article --&gt;

The [[Susquehanna River]] broke through into the many interconnected mine galleries in the [[Wyoming Valley]] between the right-bank (western shore) town of [[Exeter, Pennsylvania]] and the left-bank (eastern shore) town of [[Port Griffith, Pennsylvania|Port Griffith]] in [[Jenkins Township, Pennsylvania]], near [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]]. Mitigation efforts created several new islands between the two towns and altered the western-side flow of the Susquehanna around these.

== Accident ==
The River Slope Mine, an [[anthracite]] [[coal mine]] owned by the Knox Coal Company, flooded when coal company management had the miners dig illegally out under the [[Susquehanna River]]. Tunneling sharply upwards toward river bed without having drilled boreholes to gauge the rock thickness overhead, the miners came to a section with a thickness of about {{convert|6|feet}}—{{convert|35|feet}} was considered the minimum for safety. The insufficient "roof" cover caused the waters of the river to break into the mine.&lt;ref name=um/&gt;

It took three days to plug the hole in the riverbed, which was done by dumping large railroad cars, smaller mine cars, [[anthracite#Names|culm]], and other debris into the whirlpool formed by the water draining into the mine.&lt;ref name=um&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.undergroundminers.com/knox.html |title=Knox Mine Disaster |date=2005 |accessdate=29 December 2016 |author=Chris Murley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve mineworkers died; 69 others escaped. Amedeo Pancotti was awarded the [[Carnegie Hero Fund#Carnegie Medal|Carnegie Medal]] for climbing {{convert|50|feet}} up the abandoned Eagle Air Shaft and alerting rescuers, which led to the safe recovery of 33 men including Pancotti himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mychfc.org/Awardee.aspx?hero=44625 |title=Amedeo Pancotti, Pittston, Pennsylvania |publisher=Carnegie Hero Fund Commission |access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of the twelve who died were never recovered, despite efforts to pump the water out of the mine. The victims were Samuel Altieri, John Baloga, Benjamin Boyar, Francis Burns, Charles Featherman, Joseph Gizenski, Dominic Kaveliski, Frank Orlowski, Eugene Ostrowski, William Sinclair, Daniel Stefanides, and Herman Zelonis.&lt;ref name="Times Leader"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/mines/knox.htm |title= Knox Mine Disaster |date=1998 |accessdate=29 December 2016 |author= David Pencek |publisher= Times Leader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Knox catastrophe was less deadly than the [[Twin Shaft disaster]] in [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]] in 1896, which claimed 58 lives.

Eventually, an estimated {{convert|10|e9usgal|m3 impgal}} of water filled the mines. 

== Aftermath and legacy ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Ten people were indicted in the disaster's aftermath, including the mine superintendent, Robert Dougherty; owner Louis Fabrizio; secret owner August J. Lippi, who was also the president of District 1 of the [[United Mine Workers]]; and three union officials. Six served jail time.

January 22, 2009, marked the fiftieth anniversary of the Knox Mine Disaster, with an annual memorial mass at St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church in [[Pittston, Pennsylvania]], and a ceremony held at the former St. Joseph's Catholic Church in [[Port Griffith, Pennsylvania|Port Griffith]], which is the site of a commemorative monument and a State Historic Marker erected in 1999 by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. The church was closed in May 2008 owing to a consolidation of area parishes and put up for sale in July 2008. The property was purchased on January&amp;nbsp;15, 2009, exactly one week prior to the fiftieth anniversary, by Susan Baloga and John Baloga, the grandson of John Baloga, one of the twelve miners who perished in the event. The property is now the site of Baloga Funeral Home. The fiftieth anniversary also included a special program at the Anthracite Heritage Museum in [[Scranton]], which organized an annual program on the disaster in January.

[[File:Group of Nihang Singhs.jpg|thumb|200px|A group of [[Nihang]]s who are the chief guests at Maghi mela]]
'''Mela Maghi''', held at the holy city of [[Sri Muktsar Sahib]] each year in January, or the month of ''Magh'' according to [[Nanakshahi calendar]] is one of the most important [[mela]]s (fairs) of India and the most important of all religiously significant gatherings of the [[Sikhs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singhsabhacanada.com/Articles/Print/83 ਵਿਛੁੜੇ ਮਿਲੇ-ਮੁਕਤਸਰ ਦੀ ਜੰਗ ਤੇ ਚਾਲੀ ਮੁਕਤੇ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107011148/http://www.singhsabhacanada.com/Articles/Print/83 |date=2007-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guru Amar Das Ji chose Maghi as one of the three festivals to be celebrated by Sikhs (the others being Baisakhi and Diwali).&lt;ref&gt;Glimpses of Sikhism By Major Nahar Singh Jawandha [https://books.google.com/books?id=DQeKTUXphPMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=guru+amar+das+maghi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=832_P9qt&amp;sig=nic2zdYZVYxSEAkPtnzg1EM5P3M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ki9OVKPtC8ze7AaHwoCoDw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=guru%20amar%20das%20maghi&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singh Nirmal (2008) Searches in SIkhism. Hemkunt Press [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yMJypUEQkEQC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=guru+amar+das+goindwal+congregation+diwali&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji5vnv3MTRAhVHBBoKHSFHDQAQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=guru%20amar%20das%20goindwal%20congregation%20diwali&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the battle of Muktsar which took place on 8 May 1705,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Dh6jydKXikoC&amp;pg=PA695&amp;dq=muktsar+battle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjboL63h8LRAhVGnBoKHSorB-4Q6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=muktsar%20battle&amp;f=false] Tony Jaques (2007) Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: F-O. Greenwood Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt; (21 Vaisakh 1762 Bikrami calendar)&lt;ref&gt;Shera Siṅgha (Giānī.) (1967) Social &amp; political philosophy of Gobind Singh. Sterling Publishers (P) Ltd. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Zei1AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=battle+of+muktsar+may+1705&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=may+1705]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maghi]] became to be associated with the forty Sikhs and the battle of Muktsar. 

The Maghi fair is held to honour the memory of the forty Sikh warriors killed during the [[Battle of Muktsar]] in 1705. Muktsar, originally called Khidrana, was named as Muktsar ("the pool of liberation") following the battle. These forty Sikhs, led by their leader Mahan Singh, had formally deserted Sri Guru Gobind Singh in the need of hour, and signed a written memorandum to the effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/warriors/bhago.html Sikh History]&lt;/ref&gt; When Mai Bhago, a valiant and upright lady, heard of this cowardly act, she scolded the Singh's and inspired them refresh with spirit of bravery for which Sikhs are known. Hence, the unit went back and joined the Guru who was already engaged in action at Khidrana. All forty of them attained martyrdom. The memorandum (''bedawa'') was torn-down by the Guru himself just before Mahan Singh died.

People gather from all over Punjab, even other parts of India to join the festival which is in fact spread over many days. Merchants display their wares for sale, which include from trinkets to high-end electronics, the weapons [[Nihang]]s bear and especially agricultural machinery (since most around are farmers). The country's biggest [[circus]]es, Apollo and Gemini, are there as a matter of rule, merry-go-rounds and giant wheels, and the famous [[Well of Death]] (trick motorcycling inside consortium of wood planks) are the special attraction for children.

While kids enjoy the rides, there are tuck shops that are quite a find. Women buy crockery and home decor, men mostly interest in special (name embedded on rice grain) keyrings, posters. Kids have special corner for toys and other things. The shops sell out goggles, kitchen utensils, makeup, shoes and clothes, all in average quality and lowest market possible cost. You don't need big bucks to shop a lot. However, very limited use of electronic payments is done, as the end merchant is a poor villager, hardly touched by digital world.

It is also a very important occasion from the political point of view, as all the significant politicos, including the chief minister are there on the main day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailypost.in/editor-s-pick/55460-viewpoint-mela-maghi-lays-the-contours-of-punjab-elections| Viewpoint: Mela Maghi lays the contours of Punjab elections| Daily Post India]&lt;/ref&gt; All major political leaders/ parties hold separate stages to throw political dirt at one another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100112/bathinda.htm#2]&lt;/ref&gt; Such arrangement needs extremely tight police -up which is met by calling out forces, sometimes even CRPF and BSF battalions from neighboring areas.

'''''Merry Christmas, Drake &amp; Josh''''' (also known as '''''Drake &amp; Josh: Best Christmas Ever''''') is a television movie based on the [[Nickelodeon]] sitcom ''[[Drake &amp; Josh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Laura Griffith |url=http://www.thetelegraph.com/news/lewis_20941___article.html/drake_movie.html |title=Native makeup artist works holiday magic on 'Drake and Josh' movie |work=[[The Telegraph (Alton, Illinois)|The Telegraph]] |location=[[Alton, Illinois]] |date=December 5, 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103203932/http://www.thetelegraph.com/news/lewis_20941___article.html/drake_movie.html%23 |archivedate=January 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drake Bell]], [[Josh Peck]], [[Miranda Cosgrove]], [[Nancy Sullivan (American actress)|Nancy Sullivan]], and [[Jonathan Goldstein (actor)|Jonathan Goldstein]] reappear as their respective characters, with several recurring characters from the TV series also reappearing. The film was shot in July 2008.

The film premiered on December 5, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Robert Lloyd |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/05/entertainment/et-drakeandjosh5 |title=Drake &amp; Josh: Take 'em or leave 'em |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 5, 2008 |accessdate=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Nickelodeon Original Movie]]. It was the third most viewed TV movie on cable behind ''[[High School Musical 2]]'' and ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie]]'', both owned by [[Disney Channel]].

The film premiered 15 months after the end of the original ''Drake &amp; Josh'' series in September 2007.

==Plot==
Shortly before Christmas, Walter ([[Jonathan Goldstein (actor)|Jonathan Goldstein]]) and Audrey ([[Nancy Sullivan (American actress)|Nancy Sullivan]]) decide to leave home for a tropical vacation. Their children Drake ([[Drake Bell]]) and Megan ([[Miranda Cosgrove]]) come home while Josh ([[Josh Peck]]) shows them his snowman air balloon decoration, which Megan sabotages. Later at the mall, Drake tells Josh that he will be throwing a [[Christmas]] [[party]] on the roof of his workplace the Premiere, which Josh is unsure of, but Helen ([[Yvette Nicole Brown]]) approves. Helen then hands Drake a Santa costume to wear in the mall. While hiding from a woman looking to kiss him, Drake meets a little girl named Mary Alice ([[Bailee Madison]]) who says she and her family want the best Christmas ever. He makes an unbreakable promise that he will make it so.

At the party, Josh's co-worker Crazy Steve ([[Jerry Trainor]]) shows the two pictures of his favoured [[wood chipper]] "Sally". Craig (Alec Medlock) and Eric ([[Scott Halberstadt]]) suggest to Drake that he perform a song in the upcoming [[Christmas parade]], but Drake explains that he will be in [[Las Vegas]] at a concert. Later on, some [[party crashers]] show up whom Josh calls the police on, but he falls off the roof after they arrive during a mix-up, landing in the back of a pickup truck with the police trailing close behind, eventually rolling out only to be arrested. In jail, he meets his cellmate, Bludge ([[Kimbo Slice]]). At first, Bludge tries to beat him up until Josh entertains him with magic tricks.

Knowing he must fulfill his promise after Mary Alice tells him about her sick foster mom and busy foster dad, Drake attempts to break Josh out to help him, only to get caught and arrested. Drake and Josh are sent to court, with Helen acting as their lawyer. She informs Judge Newman ([[Henry Winkler]]) of Drake's promise to Mary Alice, who decides that they will not be sent to jail as long as they fulfill it. Afterwards, they meet their cruel and embittered parole officer Perry Gilbert (David Pressman), who says that he will hold a vote with Mary Alice's family asking if they had the best Christmas ever. If any of them say "no", they will go to jail. The duo soon meet Mary Alice's foster family, which include frequently feuding twins Lily and Violet (Camille and Cosette Goldstein), Zigfee (David Gore), a foreign boy who speaks an unknown language, know-it-all Trey (Daven Wilson), and Mary Alice's rebellious, loner older brother Luke ([[Devon Graye]]). They find many possibilities to give the family the best Christmas ever, but their attempts are foiled by Officer Gilbert. Drake and Josh enlist Megan's help to sabotage Officer Gilbert's doings by bribing her with Trevor's rare Smith Royal oboe; however, she stops upon discovering it was an empty bribe.

Josh then visits Officer Gilbert's mother, who explains that as a child, Officer Gilbert always wanted a pet [[chimpanzee]] for Christmas. When he found one sitting in a cage by the tree and opened the cage door, it attacked him, causing him to hate Christmas ever since. Drake and Josh realize that since Christmas was ruined for him, he wants to ruin it for everyone else.

Drake and Josh eventually decide to take Mary Alice's family [[Christmas carol|caroling]]; however, nobody in their neighborhood listens to them. The group decides to put on a concert, performing a rock rendition of [[12 Days of Christmas]], which the entire family, even Luke, loves so much they decide to perform it in the Christmas parade. At the parade, Officer Gilbert tricks Crazy Steve into loudly reminding the duo in front of Mary Alice that they will go to prison if they do not keep their promise. Believing they were only being nice to avoid punishment, Mary Alice and her family leave. Despite the family's anger towards them, Drake and Josh are determined to keep their promise. Meanwhile, they also send Officer Gilbert a nice chimpanzee as a Christmas present, which causes him to begin loving Christmas again. They then borrow Steve's wood chipper to make it snow in front of Mary Alice's house by putting ice in the machine, but it inadvertently shoots large chunks towards the house. After the machine knocks both brothers unconscious, Officer Gilbert brings them home.

The brothers enter the living room the next morning, where Mary Alice's family surprises them, having learned from Officer Gilbert that the two were not actually using them to stay out of prison. The vote is held, with everyone voting "yes". Bludge, dressed as Santa, then comes down the chimney to deliver gifts to everyone, including a Smith Royal oboe for Megan. Josh's girlfriend Mindy, who had left town for the holidays, arrives too after hearing about everything that happened, and Steve gets "Sally" to make snow by using 7,000 pounds of hard cheese. Drake and Josh's parents then arrive home from their troubled vacation at their "bungalow", which was blown away earlier in a [[tropical storm]]. As everyone plays in the blanket of "snow", they truly have the best Christmas ever.

'''Messier 30''' (also known as '''M30''' or '''NGC 7099''') is a [[globular cluster]] of stars in the southern [[constellation]] of [[Capricornus]]. It was discovered by the French astronomer [[Charles Messier]] in 1764, who described it as a circular [[nebula]] without a star. In the [[New General Catalogue]], compiled during the 1880s, it was described as a "remarkable globular, bright, large, slightly oval." This cluster can be easily viewed with a pair of 10×50 binoculars,&lt;ref name=jbaa118_4_231/&gt; forming a patch of hazy light some 4&amp;nbsp;[[arcminute]]s wide that is slightly elongated along the east–west axis.&lt;ref name=jbaa118_4_231/&gt; With a larger instrument, individual stars can be resolved and the cluster will cover an angle of up to 12&amp;nbsp;[[arcminute]]s across with a compressed core one arcminute wide.&lt;ref name=omeara1998/&gt; It is best observed around August.&lt;ref name=jbaa118_4_231/&gt;

M30 is located at a distance of about 27,100 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]],&lt;ref name=aa555_36/&gt; and is about 93 light-years across.&lt;ref name=omeara1998/&gt; The estimated age is roughly 12.93 billion years&lt;ref name=mnras404_3_1203/&gt; and it has a combined mass of about 160,000 times the [[solar mass|mass of the Sun]].&lt;ref name=mnras392_1_113/&gt; The cluster is following a [[retrograde orbit]] through the inner galactic halo, suggesting that it was acquired from a [[satellite galaxy]] rather than forming within the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=mnras404_3_1203/&gt; It is currently located at a distance of about {{Convert|22.2|kly|kpc|abbr=on}} from the center of the galaxy, compared to an estimated {{Convert|26|kly|kpc|abbr=on}} for the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name=aj117_1_277/&gt;

The M30 cluster has passed through a dynamic process called [[Core collapse (cluster)|core collapse]] and now has a concentration of mass at its core of about a million times the [[solar mass|Sun's mass]] per cubic [[parsec]]. This makes it one of the highest density regions in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. Stars in such close proximity will experience a high rate of interactions that can create [[binary star]] systems, as well as a type of star called a [[blue straggler]] that is formed by mass transfer.&lt;ref name=apj657_1_286/&gt; A process of mass segregation may have caused the central region to gain a greater proportion of higher mass stars, creating a color gradient with increasing blueness toward the middle of the cluster.&lt;ref name=aj119_3_1259/&gt;

==Areas of competition==
Prior to the final telecast, all contestants competed in swimsuit and evening gown during the preliminary competition. They also participated in interviews with the judges.

During the final competition, the top fifteen contestants (based on their preliminary scores) competed in the swimsuit competition, and the top ten competed in evening gown. The final five contestants participated in a final round of on-stage interviews, before the runners-up were announced and the new Miss Universe named.

This was the first year since 2002 that the judges' average scores were shown on television.

It was the first time since 2001 that the final question posed on the ladies came from the judges. The previous pageants had final questions coming from the current Miss Universe and the delegates participating in the final five themselves.

==National costume controversy==
* '''{{Flag|Mexico}}''' – In April 2007, controversy erupted over the proposed national costume of Rosa María Ojeda, Miss Mexico. The skirt of the costume depicted scenes from the [[Cristero War]], a [[Roman Catholic]] rebellion in the 1920s in which thousands of people were killed, including [[hangings]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6571061.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Miss Mexico 'war gown' toned down |date=19 April 2007|accessdate=24 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outfit included a bullet-studded belt and [[crucifix necklace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Mexico's pageant dress kick-starts outrage|work=El Paso Times|date=21 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was chosen from over thirty others and had been intended to show Mexico's culture and history, but it elicited controversy amid claims it was in poor taste and inappropriate.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Pageant owners said that the costume would be redesigned to include image of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

The '''Rochester International Film Festival''', the world's oldest continuously-held short film festival, has been produced each year since 1959 by Movies on a Shoestring, Inc. Each festival includes a wide variety of narrative films, documentaries, and animations submitted by independent filmmakers from all parts of the world.

All filmmakers are invited to submit entries for consideration. Each film selected for the festival is awarded the distinctive Shoestring Trophy. The festival offers appreciative, movie-wise audiences to view accepted films at the Dryden Theatre, George Eastman House International Museum of Film and Photography in Rochester, NY.

Movies on a Shoestring Inc. was founded in 1959 by a group of Rochester-area movie enthusiasts to provide a venue for independent filmmakers to present their cinematic creations. The name was a double entendre: most amateur filmmakers shot on 8&amp;nbsp;mm back then, and the narrowness of the stock led it to call it "the shoestring gauge."

The first public exhibition at the Rochester Public Library. It consisted of 16 films made by people from the Rochester area. During the second year a film from Toronto, Ontario, Canada was included, and in a modest sense Movies on a Shoestring became an international festival. That was also the year the show moved to the Dryden Theatre through the courtesy of George Eastman House. Three hundred people attended the performance.

1964 was their first truly international year. The festival received films from all over the United States as well as five foreign countries. This international activity prompted them in 1965 to identify their shows as the Rochester International Movie Film Festival and to become a charter member of the International Association of Amateur Film Festivals, a worldwide organization dedicated to establishing standards and consistency among festivals of this type.

By 1971 Movies on a Shoestring had firmly established itself among the world's leading amateur festivals, so they modified their name to the Rochester International Amateur Film Festival. In 1983 they accepted their first video entries. The worldwide growth of film schools and of the film industry in general has led to a great increase in the number of professional quality short films being produced and competing for spots in the festival, so in 1996 they dropped the word "amateur" from our name and became The Rochester International Film Festival.

To provide independent filmmakers even greater public exposure, beginning in 1972, selected films from each year's festival, based on audience surveys taken at each show, have been assembled into a collection called The Best of the Fest. It has been made possible to borrow films from the collection, free of charge, by organizations around the state.

The festival is screened at the George Eastman House's [[Dryden Theatre]] each spring usually in April.

The [[festival]] is associated with ''Movies on a Shoestring, Inc.'' - an independent [[non-profit organization]]. The ''Rochester International Film Festival'' is a member of the ''Arts &amp; Cultural Council for Greater Rochester''.

For one year, in 2008, the festival merged with the '''High Falls Film Festival''' to become the [[Rochester-High Falls International Film Festival]]. The two festivals have since separated, although the '''High Falls Film Festival''' changed their name in 2010 to become the [[360 365 Film Festival]].

The '''Sayings of Jesus on the cross''' (also called the '''Seven Last Words from the Cross''') are seven expressions biblically attributed to [[Jesus]] during [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]]. Traditionally, the brief sayings have been called "words". They are gathered from the four [[Canonical Gospel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey W. Bromiley, ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', Eerdmans Press 1995, {{ISBN|0-8028-3784-0}} p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph F. Kelly, ''An Introduction to the New Testament for Catholics'' Liturgical Press, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-5216-9}} p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the sayings appear only in the [[Gospel of Luke]] and three only in the [[Gospel of John]]. The other saying appears both in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Mark]].&lt;ref name=Houlden627 &gt;''Jesus: the complete guide'' by Leslie Houlden 2006 {{ISBN|0-8264-8011-X}} p. 627&lt;/ref&gt; In Matthew and Mark, Jesus cries out to God. In Luke, he forgives his killers, reassures the penitent thief, and commends his spirit to the Father. In John, he speaks to his mother, says he thirsts, and declares the end of his earthly life.

A person's [[Last words|final articulated words]] said prior to death or as death approaches generally are taken to have particular significance. These seven sayings, being "[[last words]]", may provide a way to understand what was ultimately important to this man who was dying on the cross.&lt;ref name=Hamilton&gt;Hamilton, Adam. ''24 Hours That Changed the World''. Abingdon Press, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-687-46555-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sparsity of sayings recorded in the biblical accounts suggests that Jesus remained relatively silent for the hours he hung there.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Ralph F. "The Seven Last Words of Christ from the Cross".&lt;http://www.jesuswalk.com/7-last-words/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 16th century they have been widely used in sermons on [[Good Friday]], and entire books have been written on theological analysis of them.&lt;ref name=Houlden627 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus of Nazareth'' by W. Mccrocklin 2006 {{ISBN|1-59781-863-1}} p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Houlden645 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Seven Last Words From The Cross'' by Fleming Rutledge 2004 {{ISBN|0-8028-2786-1}} p. 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; The Seven Last Words from the Cross are an integral part of the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] in the [[Anglican]], [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]], [[Protestant]], and other Christian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QHz5czNrWlYC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=seven+last+words+from+the+cross+Good+Friday+Methodist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Echoes from Calvary: meditations on Franz Joseph Haydn's The seven last words of Christ, Volume 1|date=Feb 25, 2005|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |accessdate= 1 April 2012|quote=Interestingly, the Methodist ''Book of Worship'' adopted by the General Conference of 1964 presented two services for Good Friday: a Three Hours' Service for the afternoon and a Good Friday evening service that includes the "Adoration at the Cross" (the Gospel, Deprecations, and Adoration of the Cross) but omits a communion service, which would be the Methodist equivalent of the Mass of the Presanctified.|author=Richard Young|isbn=9780742543843}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=PWYMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=seven+last+words+from+the+cross+Good+Friday+Anglican#v=onepage&amp;q=seven%20last%20words%20from%20the%20cross%20Good%20Friday%20Anglican&amp;f=false |title=The Encyclopædia Americana: a library of universal knowledge, Volume 13|year=1919|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Americana]]|accessdate=1 April 2012|quote=The 'Three Hours' Devotion, borrowed from Roman usage, with meditation on the 'seven last words' from the Cross, and held from 12 till 3, when our Lord hung on the Cross, is a service of Good Friday that meets with increasing acceptance among the Anglicans.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven-sayings tradition is an example of the Christian approach to the construction of a [[Gospel harmony]] in which material from different Gospels is combined, producing an account that goes beyond each Gospel.&lt;ref name=Houlden627 /&gt;&lt;ref name = "JInt"&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]]. [[Jesus, Interrupted]], HarperCollins, 2009. {{ISBN|0-06-117393-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[composer]]s have [[Musical settings of The Seven Last Words of Christ|set the Seven Last Words to music]].

== Seven sayings ==
The seven sayings form part of a Christian [[meditation]] that is often used during [[Lent]], [[Holy Week]] and [[Good Friday]].  The traditional order of the sayings is:&lt;ref&gt;Jan Majernik, ''The Synoptics'', Emmaus Road Press: 2005 {{ISBN|1-931018-31-6}}, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

# Luke 23:34: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.
# Luke 23:43: Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.
# John 19:26–27: Woman, behold your son. Son, behold your mother
# Matthew 27:46 &amp; Mark 15:34 My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?
# John 19:28: I thirst.
# John 19:30: It is finished. (From the Greek "Tetelestai" which is also translated "It is accomplished", or "It is complete".)
# Luke 23:46: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.

Traditionally, these seven sayings are called words of 1. ''Forgiveness'', 2. ''Salvation'', 3. ''Relationship'', 4. ''Abandonment'', 5. ''Distress'', 6. ''Triumph'' and 7. ''Reunion''.&lt;ref name=Bromiley /&gt;

As can be seen from the above list, not all seven sayings can be found in any one account of Jesus' crucifixion. The ordering is a [[Gospel harmony|harmonisation of the texts from each of the four canonical gospels]]. In the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Aramaic of Jesus|Jesus is quoted in Aramaic]], shouting the ''fourth'' phrase.. In [[Gospel of Luke|Luke's Gospel]], the first, second, and seventh sayings occur. The third, fifth and sixth sayings can only be found in [[Gospel of John|John's Gospel]]. In other words:
* In [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] :
** ''My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?''
* In [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]:
** ''Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do''
** ''Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise'' (in response to [[Dismas|one of the two thieves crucified next to him]])
** ''Father, into your hands I commit my spirit'' (last words)
* In [[Gospel of John|John]]:
** ''Woman, behold your son: behold your mother'' (directed at Mary, the mother of Jesus, either as a self-reference, or as a reference to the [[beloved disciple]] and an instruction to the disciple himself)
** ''I thirst'' (just before a wetted sponge, mentioned by all the Canonical Gospels, is offered)
** ''It is finished'' (last words)

=== 1. {{anchor|Luke 23:34}}Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing ===
{{bibleref2|Luke|23:34}}
: ''Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."''

This first saying of Jesus on the cross is traditionally called "The Word of Forgiveness".&lt;ref name=Bromiley /&gt; It is theologically interpreted as Jesus' prayer for [[forgiveness]] for the Roman soldiers who were crucifying him and all others who were involved in his crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vernon K. Robbins]] in ''Literary studies in Luke-Acts'' by Richard P. Thompson (editor) 1998 {{ISBN|0-86554-563-4}} pp. 200–201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mercer dictionary of the Bible'' by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 1998 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} p. 648&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Reading Luke-Acts: dynamics of Biblical narrative'' by William S. Kurz 1993 {{ISBN|0-664-25441-1}} p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luke's presentation of Jesus: a Christology'' by [[:de:Robert F. O'Toole]] 2004 {{ISBN|88-7653-625-6}} p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early manuscripts do not include this sentence in Luke 23:34.&lt;ref&gt;Steven L. Cox, Kendell H. Easley, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2. {{anchor|Luke 23:43}}Today you will be with me in paradise ===
{{bibleref2|Luke|23:43|NIV}}
&lt;!--Almost all translations have a comma or a colon before "today". KJV has a period and new sentence starting "Today" --&gt;
: ''And he said to him, "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise".''

This saying is traditionally called "The Word of Salvation".&lt;ref name=Bromiley /&gt; According to Luke's Gospel, Jesus was crucified between two thieves (traditionally named [[Dismas]] and [[Gestas]]), one of whom supports Jesus' innocence and asks him to remember him when he comes into his kingdom. Jesus replies, "Truly, I say to you..." ({{lang|grc|ἀμήν λέγω σοί}}, ''[[Amen#New Testament|amēn]] legō soi''), followed with the only appearance of the word "[[Paradise]]" in the Gospels ({{lang|grc|παραδείσω}}, ''paradeisō'', from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''pairidaeza'' "[[paradise garden]]").

A seemingly simple change in punctuation in this saying has been the subject of doctrinal differences among Christian groups, given the lack of punctuation in the original Greek texts.&lt;ref name=Buckley48 &gt;''The Blackwell Companion to Catholicism'' by James Buckley, Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt and Trent Pomplun, 2010 {{ISBN|1-4443-3732-7}} p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics and most Protestant Christians usually use a version which reads "today you will be with me in Paradise".&lt;ref name=Buckley48 /&gt; This reading assumes a direct voyage to Heaven and has no implications of [[purgatory]].&lt;ref name=Buckley48 /&gt; On the other hand, some Protestants who believe in [[soul sleep]] have used a reading which emphasizes "I say to you today", leaving open the possibility that the statement was made today, but arrival in Heaven may be later.&lt;ref name=Buckley48 /&gt;

=== 3. {{anchor|John 19:26-27}}Behold your son: behold your mother ===
[[File:N-s-dos-passos-19.jpg|thumb|right|Crucifixion depicted as ''[[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater]]'' with the Virgin Mary, [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brasil]], 19th century.]]

{{bibleref2|John|19:26-27}}
: ''Jesus saw his own mother, and the disciple standing near whom he loved, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold your son". Then he said to the disciple, "Behold your mother". And from that hour, he took his mother into his family.''

This statement is traditionally called "The Word of Relationship" and in it Jesus entrusts [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]], his mother, into the care of "[[disciple whom Jesus loved|the disciple whom Jesus loved]]".&lt;ref name=Bromiley /&gt;

Methodist minister [[Adam Hamilton (pastor)|Adam Hamilton]]'s 2009 interpretation: "Jesus looked down from the cross to see his mother standing nearby. As far as we know, only one of the twelve apostles was there at the foot of the cross: "the disciple whom Jesus loved," usually identified as John. Naked and in horrible pain, he thought not of himself but was concerned for the well-being of his mother after his death. This shows Jesus' humanity and the depth of love he had for his mother and the disciple into whose care he entrusted her."&lt;ref name=Hamilton/&gt;

===4. {{anchor|Matthew 27:46|Mark 15:34}}My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?===
{{redirect|My God, My God, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?|the film|My God, My God, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me? (film)}}
{{see also|Language of Jesus#EliEli|label 1=Language of Jesus#Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani (Ἠλί, Ἠλί, λιμὰ σαβαχθανί)}}
{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:46}}
: ''Around the ninth hour, Jesus shouted in a loud voice, saying "Eli Eli lama sabachthani?" which is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"''
{{bibleref2|Mark|15:34}}
: ''And at the ninth hour, Jesus shouted in a loud voice, "Eloi Eloi lama sabachthani?" which is translated, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"''

It is the only saying that appears in more than one Gospel,&lt;ref name=Bromiley /&gt; and is a quote from {{bibleverse|Psalms|22:1|HE}}. This saying is taken by some as an abandonment of the Son by the Father. Other theologians understand the cry as that of one who was truly human and who felt forsaken. Put to death by his foes, very largely deserted by his friends, he may have felt also deserted by God.&lt;ref&gt;Conner, W.T. ''The Cross in the New Testament''. Nashville: Broadman Press, 1954. ASIN: B0007EIIPI  p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Others point to this as the first words of [[Psalm 22]] and suggest that Jesus recited these words, perhaps even the whole psalm, "that he might show himself to be the very Being to whom the words refer; so that the Jewish scribes and people might examine and see the cause why he would not descend from the cross; namely, because this very psalm showed that it was prophetized that He would suffer these things."&lt;ref&gt;"Pulpit Commentary". See Mark 15:34, http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/15.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Theologian Frank Stagg]] points to what he calls "a mystery of Jesus' incarnation: "...he who died at Golgotha (Calvary) is one with the Father, that God was in Christ, and that at the same time he cried out to the Father".&lt;ref name=StaggF&gt;Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the phrase was/is rendered, "אלי אלי למה שבקתני".

While ''"[[Five Holy Wounds#The wounds|the nails]] in the wrists are putting pressure on the [[Proper palmar digital nerves of median nerve|large median nerve]], and the severely damaged nerve causes excruciating pain"'', the [[Lamb of God]] experiences the abandonment of the [[Soul#Religious views#Christianity|soul]] by God, a deeply excruciating pain that ''"is the essence of eternal condemnation in [[Gehenna#The concept of Gehinnom|Hell]]"''.&lt;ref name="uogcc.org,

28-02-2011" /&gt;

===5. {{anchor|John 19:28}}I thirst===
{{bibleref2|John|19:28}}
: ''He said, "I thirst".''

This statement is traditionally called "The Word of Distress" and is compared and contrasted with the encounter of Jesus with the [[Samaritan Woman at the Well]] in {{Bibleref2|John|4:4-26}}.&lt;ref name=Bromiley &gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1988 {{ISBN|0-8028-3785-9}} p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the other accounts, the Gospel of John says Jesus was offered a drink of sour wine, adding that this person placed a sponge dipped in wine on a hyssop branch and held it to Jesus' lips. Hyssop branches had figured significantly in the Old Testament and in the Book of Hebrews.&lt;ref&gt;Hyssop. cf. {{Bibleref2|Exodus|12:22}}: used to sprinkle the blood of the Passover lamb above the doors of the Israelite's dwellings when the firstborn of the Egyptians were killed; {{Bibleref2|Leviticus|14}}: hyssop wrapped in yarn was used to sprinkle blood and water upon the lepers; {{Bibleref2|Leviticus|14}}: hyssop wrapped in yarn also used on the ceremonially unclean so they might be made clean again; {{Bibleref2|Psalm|51:7}}: David, in his prayer of confession, cried out to God, "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean."; and {{Bibleref2|Hebrews|9:19-20}}: after Moses gave the people the [[Ten Commandments]], "he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people, saying, 'This is the blood of the covenant that God has ordained for you.{{' "}}

This statement of Jesus is interpreted by John as fulfilment of the prophecy given in {{Bibleref2|Psalm|69:21}} (cf. {{Bibleref2|Psalm|22:15}}), hence the quotation from John's Gospel includes the comment "to fulfill the scriptures".

===6. {{anchor|John 19:30}}It is finished===
[[John 19:30]]
: ''Jesus said, "It is finished".''
This statement is traditionally called "The Word of Triumph" and is theologically interpreted as the announcement of the end of the earthly life of Jesus, in anticipation for the Resurrection.&lt;ref name=Bromiley /&gt;

Adam Hamilton writes: "These last words are seen as a cry of victory, not of dereliction. Jesus had now completed what he came to do. A plan was fulfilled; a salvation was made possible; a love shown. He had taken our place. He had demonstrated both humanity's brokenness and God's love. He had offered himself fully to God as a sacrifice on behalf of humanity. As he died, it was finished. With these words, the noblest person who ever walked the face of this planet, God in the flesh, breathed his last."&lt;ref name=Hamilton/&gt;{{rp|p.112}}

The verse has also been translated as "It is consummated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/john/19-30.htm|title=John 19:30|quote="Jesus therefore, when he had taken the vinegar, said: It is consummated. And bowing his head, he gave up the ghost."|publisher=''Douay-Rheims Bible''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===7. {{anchor|Luke 23:46}}Father, into your hands I commend my spirit===
{{bibleref2|Luke|23:46}}
: ''And speaking in a loud voice, Jesus said, "Father, into your hands I commend my spirit".''

From {{Bibleref2|Psalm|31:5}}, this saying, which is an announcement and not a request, is traditionally called "The Word of Reunion" and is theologically interpreted as the proclamation of Jesus joining [[God the Father]] in Heaven.&lt;ref name=Bromiley /&gt;

Hamilton has written that "When darkness seem to prevail in life, it takes faith even to talk to God, even if it is to complain to him. These last words of Jesus from the cross show his absolute trust in God: 'Father, into your hands I commend my spirit'. This has been termed a model of prayer for everyone when afraid, sick, or facing one's own death. It says in effect:"
{{quotation|I commit myself to you, O God. In my living and in my dying, in the good times and in the bad, whatever I am and have, I place in your hands, O God, for your safekeeping.&lt;ref name=Hamilton/&gt;{{rp|p.112}}}}

==Theological interpretations==
The last words of Jesus have been the subject of a wide range of Christian teachings and sermons, and a number of authors have written books specifically devoted to the last sayings of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;David Anderson-Berry, ''The Seven Sayings of Christ on the Cross'', Glasgow: Pickering &amp; Inglis Publishers, 1871&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Pink]], ''The Seven Sayings of the Saviour on the Cross'', Baker Books 2005, {{ISBN|0-8010-6573-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Peter Long, ''The wounded Word: A brief meditation on the seven sayings of Christ on the cross'', Baker Books 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Priest and author [[Timothy Radcliffe]] states that in the Bible, seven is the number of perfection, and he views the seven last words as God's completion of the circle of creation and performs analysis of the structure of the seven last words to obtain further insight.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Radcliffe, 2005 ''Seven Last Words'', {{ISBN|0-86012-397-9}} p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other interpretations and translations==
[[File:Miguel Angel Crucifixion La Redonda Logrono Spain.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michelangelo]]: ''Crucifixion of Christ'', 1540]]
The saying "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me" is generally given in transliterated [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] with a translation (originally in [[Greek language|Greek]]) after it. This phrase is the opening line of {{bibleref2|Psalm|22|CEV}}, a psalm about persecution, the mercy and salvation of God. It was common for people at this time to reference songs by quoting their first lines. In the verses immediately following this saying, in both Gospels, the onlookers who hear Jesus' cry understand him to be calling for help from [[Elijah]] (Eliyyâ). The slight differences between the two gospel accounts are most probably due to dialect. Matthew's version seems to have been more influenced by [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], whereas Mark's is perhaps more colloquial.

The phrase could be either:

:* אלי אלי למה עזבתני [ēlî ēlî lamâ azavtanî]; or
:* אלי אלי למא שבקתני [ēlî ēlî lamâ šabaqtanî]; or
:* אלהי אלהי למא שבקתני [ēlâhî ēlâhî lamâ šabaqtanî]

The Aramaic word šabaqtanî is based on the verb šabaq, 'to allow, to permit, to forgive, and to forsake', with the perfect tense ending -t (2nd person singular: 'you'), and the object suffix -anî (1st person singular: 'me').&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of biblical tradition in English literature'' by David L. Jeffrey 1993 {{ISBN|0-8028-3634-8}} p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archibald Thomas Robertson|A. T. Robertson]] noted that the "so-called [[Gospel of Peter]] [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/gospelpeter.html 1.5] preserves this saying in a [[Docetism|Docetic]] ([[Cerinthus|Cerinthian]]) form: 'My power, my power, thou hast forsaken me!{{' "}}&lt;ref name="robertson"&gt;''Robertson's Word Pictures of the New Testament'' (Broadman-Holman, 1973), vol. 1. {{ISBN|0-8054-1307-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historicity of the sayings==
[[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] considers the seven sayings weakly rooted in tradition and sees them as a part of the elaborations in the diverse retellings of Jesus' final hours.&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;James G. D. Dunn, ''Jesus Remembered'', Eerdmans, 2003, pp. 779–781.&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn, however, argues in favour of the authenticity of the Mark/Matthew saying in that by presenting Jesus as seeing himself 'forsaken' it would have been [[Criterion of embarrassment|an embarrassment]] to the [[early Church]], and hence would not have been invented.&lt;ref name= Dunn/&gt; [[Geza Vermes]], states that the first saying from (Matthew and Mark) is a quotation from [[Psalm 22]], and is therefore occasionally seen as a theological and literary device employed by the writers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geza Vermes]], ''The Passion'', Penguin 2005, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vermes, attempts to interpret the expression as a hopeful reference to scripture provide indirect evidence of its authenticity.&lt;ref name="Vermes"&gt;Vermes, Géza. The authentic gospel of Jesus. London, Penguin Books. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leslie Houlden]], on the other hand, states that Luke may have deliberately excluded the Matthew/Mark saying from his Gospel because it did not fit in the model of Jesus he was presenting.&lt;ref name=Houlden627 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Houlden645 &gt;''Jesus in history, thought, and culture: an encyclopedia, Volume 1'' by James Leslie Houlden 2003 {{ISBN|1-57607-856-6}} p. 645&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sensation''' is an indoor electronic dance music event which originated in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]] and organized by [[ID&amp;T]]. The original event, which ran exclusively in the [[Amsterdam Arena]] for a period of five years until 2005, is now located throughout [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], the [[Czech Republic]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Turkey]], the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[South Korea]], [[Romania]], [[South Africa]], [[Switzerland]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[India]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

==History==
In 2000 and 2001, it was made up of one edition, just called Sensation, but it has now been split up into two editions: Sensation Black and Sensation White. This was done to differentiate the music and feeling more than would have been possible if it were one event. Sensation Black focuses more on 'darker' music, like [[Hardstyle]] and [[Hardcore dance music|Hardcore]], whereas Sensation White focuses more on [[trance music]]. Every year, Sensation also releases two doublediscs (Black and White) and two singles they call the Anthem. 2008 the names of both events have been changed: "Sensation" (formerly "Sensation White"), and "Black" (formerly "Sensation Black").

The first edition of Sensation, in 2000, did not sell out. The media announced that it was sold out in order to boost interest in the event, which eventually attracted 20,000 people. In this first edition, the DJs only used one side of the Amsterdam Arena as the stage. Later editions have the stage in the middle. This Sensation was the only one that did not have a dress code. All subsequent editions of Sensation White have sold out, usually well in advance (usually all 45,000 tickets are sold in a few hours). Sensation Black has not been as successful, but is usually either close to selling out, or sold out a few days before the event.

In 2005, Sensation White was also held in Belgium and Germany. In 2006, [[ID&amp;T]] started Sensation International, an international tour, based on the simplified version which could be seen in the Amsterdam ArenA, in 2005. The first edition was held in the [[Antwerp]] Sportpaleis. In 2008 Sensation White was held at [[SCC Peterburgsky]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], and a New Year version was held at the [[Telstra Dome]] in [[Melbourne]] on the 31 December 2008 (38,380 attendance). Sensation White's new anthem put place in 2014 is "Tremor" by [[Martin Garrix]], and [[Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike]] and Sensation White's official slogan is "Be part of the night, dress in white".

In 2017, it was announced that July's event was to be the last Sensation to take place in Amsterdam, with all future editions to be held outside of Holland.  Titled 'The Final', the last Amsterdam event took place on Saturday the 8th of July (breaking with the tradition of always taking place on the first Saturday of July) and attracted a sold-out capacity crowd of over 50,000 party people.  At the time of writing (July 2017) it's not clear how much longer the Sensation brand will continue outside of Holland, but there are parties booked toward the end of 2017 in Australia, Jakarta and Dubai.

Sensation White used to be a [[Trance music|trance]] event, but in later years it has become a pure [[House music|house]] event. All the attendees are required to wear white and the Amsterdam ArenA itself is decorated to match. Sensation White's slogan is "Be Part Of The Night - Dress in White". Every event has around 40,000-45,000 tickets available. The Amsterdam ArenA event takes place every year on the first Saturday in July while the German event in the [[LTU Arena]] in [[Düsseldorf]] is held on New Year's Eve. In 2009 it was organized for the first time on two subsequent nights on 3 and 4 July in the [[Amsterdam Arena]] where the opening of the Wicked Wonderland took place.

Notable DJs that have appeared at Sensation include [[Tiësto]], [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Hardwell]], [[Martin Garrix]], [[Nicky Romero]], [[Afrojack]], [[André Tanneberger]], [[Darren Emerson]] (one of the [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]] members), [[David Guetta]], [[NERVO (duo)|NERVO]], [[Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike]], [[Erick E]], [[Erick Morillo]], [[Ferry Corsten]], [[Marco V]], [[Paul van Dyk]], [[Sven Väth]], [[Johan Gielen]], [[Sander Kleinenberg]], [[Steve Angello]], [[Fedde Le Grand]], [[Sebastian Ingrosso]], [[Sander van Doorn]], [[Mason (DJ)|Mason]], [[Felix Da Housecat]], [[Chuckie (DJ)|Chuckie]], [[Laidback Luke]], [[Tocadisco]], [[Rank 1]], [[DJ Jean]], [[Judge Jules]], [[Carl Cox]], [[Martin Solveig]] and [[Dada Life]].

The event has recently been criticized by trance fans who think there is too much house and electro and too few trance DJs in the recent events.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} However, in the eyes of the organizers, the popularity of trance has been receding in the past few years, and therefore Sensation White has adapted to this by altering its programming to add house and electro house. Nonetheless, the popularity of trance and indeed the DJs associated with the genre still seem to be a major force in Europe. [[Trance Energy]], with over 30,000 people, has been selling out faster than ever before. In the 2008 edition of Sensation, there was only one trance DJ present in the line-up: Marco V. In 2009, trance was left out completely in favor of house (classics) and techno, however the music of the 2009 Amsterdam event turned out to be more trance like again.

In 2010, Sensation, to enforce the notion that they are now a House event, came up with the theme "Celebrate Life with House". It featured performances by Chuckie, Swedish House Mafia, Sunnery James and Ryan Marciano, and Joris Voorn &amp; 2000 And One.  The event became exclusively a party for house music.  This change in genre caused that for the first time since 2000, the tickets did not sell out the same day they went on sale, as audiences are much more demanding.  In the end, about 35,000 people attended the festival held 3 July.  To create interest in the now House event, Sensation came up with a contest where the fans, via the social networks, would vote for their favorite theme and make it the anthem for 2010.  The competing songs, featuring a selection of house and minimal themes, were not well received by Sensation followers and the competition was eventually cancelled. During the main event in Amsterdam, Sensation decided to go back to its origins, by playing their trademark anthem "Superstring", reminding its fans that although it is now a House event, it stays true to its origins as promulgated by Ron Manager and the Three Musketeers.

==BLACK (formerly known as Sensation Black)==

BLACK slowly builds up the pace, starting from [[hard trance]], [[hardstyle]] and then [[Gabber music|hardcore]]. Sensation Black is always held in the second weekend of July. All attendees are required to dress completely in black.

Notable DJs that have appeared at Sensation Black include [[Showtek]], [[Angerfist]], [[Headhunterz]], Marcel Woods, [[Chris Liebing]], [[DJ Lady Dana]], DJ Luna, [[DJ Zany]], [[The Prophet (musician)|The Prophet]], [[Technoboy]], [[Tommyknocker (producer)|Tommyknocker]], [[Yoji Biomehanika]] and [[Mauro Picotto]].

An incident occurred at Sensation Black in 2006, where DJ Rob Gee and his live band Ampt performed at the event against the recommendations of the majority of ID&amp;T's staff, and were subsequently booed and catcalled during the performance, which was more rock/metal oriented. Slight mayhem ensued as a member of the audience climbed onto the stage and hit Rob Gee himself and was then repeatedly kicked and punched in the head by Rob and his band. The rest of Rob Gee's performance was cancelled and ID&amp;T's manager, Duncan Stutterheim, later acknowledged his mistake in allowing Rob Gee to perform against the wishes of his employees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

The 2009 edition of BLACK was not held in the Netherlands, but only in Belgium because ID&amp;T is looking for a better location.
Additionally Sensation (formerly known as "Sensation White") was held on two subsequent nights in the Amsterdam ArenA in 2009, but will be sharing one of the two available night licences for the Amsterdam ArenA in 2010 with the one time replacement of BLACK called the "Feestfabriek" from [[ID&amp;T]]'s sister organisation [[Q-dance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2805">The '''Slumdance film festival''' was a film festival held in [[Park City, Utah]] in January 1997 by founder [[Brian Flemming]] in a converted [[Mrs. Fields]] cookie factory on Main Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_8/8_skizz.asp?IshNum=8&amp;Headline=Mr.%20Cyzyk%20Goes%20To%20Utah|title=Mr. Cyzyk Goes To Utah|first=Skizz|last=Cyzyk|work=[[Cashiers du Cinemart]]|accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turan&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EsIzgmd3CW8C&amp;pg=PA34|title=Sundance to Sarajevo: Film Festivals and the World They Made|first=Kenneth|last=Turan|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2002|isbn=9780520930827|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Slumdance was formed after Flemming's film ''[[Hang Your Dog in the Wind]]'' was rejected by [[Sundance Film Festival]]. Slumdance showed seven features and two shorts.  Besides two screening rooms, there was a Build Your Own Festival option that used videocassettes and VCRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-02-02/news/9702020371_1_slumdance-sundance-two-years-mrs-fields-cookies|title=New Kids On The Block|last=Caro|first=Mark|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=1997-02-02|accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slumdance was set up like a slum, and had a mission area that served free soup, a "Tent City" which was decorated like hobo housing.&lt;ref name=turan/&gt; The converted Slumdance space was 6000 square feet in total.&lt;ref name=turan /&gt; A total of 150 submissions were entered by opening night, and made a press release that stated "Slumdance Stuns Movie World by Existing".&lt;ref name=turan /&gt;

The event garnered some media attention, and the parties attracted celebrities including [[Tim Robbins]].&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/607476/Slum-fest-wont-hit-Park-City-but-rival-rebels-vie-for-sites.html?pg=all | title=Slum-fest won't hit Park City, but rival rebels vie for sites|last=Vice|first=Jeff|work=[[Deseret News]]|date=1998-01-16|accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brief interview followed on the Sundance Channel and included what the ''[[Deseret News]]'' called "uncomfortable comments" directed at Sundance mogul [[Robert Redford]].&lt;ref name=news /&gt; An internet based site calling itself the "Slumdance Historical Preservation Society" confirmed that Slumdance would not occur the following year.&lt;ref name=news /&gt;  An online-only festival was held in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/festivals/85/|title=What reeks?|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[Film Threat]]|date=2000-06-01|accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7295">'''Thanatosensitivity''' describes an [[epistemological]]-[[methodological]] approach into [[technological]] research and design that actively seeks to integrate the facts of mortality, [[dying]], and [[death]] into traditional [[user-centered design]]. First coined by Michael Massimi and Andrea Charise from the [[University of Toronto]] in a joint paper presented at [[CHI (conference)|CHI]] 2009, ''thanatosensitivity'' refers to a [[humanistic]]ally grounded approach to [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI) research and design that recognizes and engages with the conceptual and [[practical]] issues surrounding death in the creation of interactive systems.&lt;ref name=ddm&gt;{{Cite book|last=Massimi|first=Michael|author2=Andrea Charise |title=Dying, death, and mortality: towards thanatosensitivity in HCI|journal=CHI EA '09: Proceedings of the 27th International Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|year=2009|pages=2459–2468|doi=10.1145/1520340.1520349|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1520349|isbn=9781605582474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term thanatosensitive is derived from the [[ancient Greek]] [[mythological]] [[personification]] of death, [[Thanatos]] (Greek: Θάνατος (Thánatos), "Death"), which is itself a term associated with the notion of the [[death drive]] common to 20th-century post-[[Freudian]] thought. This [[Interdisciplinarity|inter]]- or [[Multidisciplinarity|multi-disciplinarity]] is crucial to thanatosensitive investigation because, unlike many areas of HCI research, studies of death and mortality are rarely amenable to [[laboratory]] study or traditional [[fieldwork]] approaches. As Massimi and Charise argue, the critical [[Humanism|humanist]] aspect of thanatosensitivity effectively offers "a non-invasive strategy for better understanding the conceptual and practical issues surrounding death, computing, and human experience".&lt;ref name=ddm /&gt;

== Conceptual and practical applications ==

Historically, design and research in the [[computer sciences]] has rarely considered the issues pursuant to the death of the [[user (computing)|user]]. However, Lindley et al. note, "[s]hifts in the field of HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) coupled with the growing maturity of interactive technologies is leading researchers and designers to consider issues relating to mortality."&lt;ref name=xant&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindley|first=Siân E.|author2=Eduardo H. Calvillo Gámez |author3=Juan José Gámez Leija |title=Remembering rituals of remembrance: Capturing Xantolo through SenseCam|journal=CHI 2010 Workshop on HCI at the End of Life|date=April 2010|url=http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/?id=121334}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of [[Digital data|digitally mediated]] (and often password-protected) [[personal data]] and [[Online identity|online identities]], as well as [[biometric]]al practices, "routinely assume a living body for access",&lt;ref name=ddm /&gt; which makes access to data following death increasingly problematic for individuals and relatives, as well as institutions and corporations, that may have claims to or stakes in such materials. A 2004 news story describes how [[Yahoo!]] denied the family of Justin Ellsworth, a deceased [[US marine]], access to his [[email]], preventing them from accessing information necessary for handling the aftermath of the account owner's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo denies family access to dead marine's e-mail |publisher=CNET News |date=December 21, 2004 |url=http://news.cnet.com/Yahoo-denies-family-access-to-dead-marines-e-mail/2100-1038_3-5500057.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining how digital information and artefacts "can be bequeathed, inherited, and appropriately repurposed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dundee.academia.edu/WendyMoncur/Papers/449465/Digital_Inheritance |author=Wendy Moncur |author2=Annalu Waller |year=2010|title=Digital Inheritance |at=RCUK Digital Futures 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while accounting for the complexity of [[Digital privacy|privacy concerns]] presents a new horizon of human-computer interaction research. "At a fundamental level, such issues are becoming increasingly prominent as technology companies decide how to handle email accounts or webpages belonging to people who are now deceased."&lt;ref name=xant /&gt; Recent scholarship in this area has called for the development of more purposive applications for facilitating the inheritance of digital materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiley|first=Cyndi|title=HCI International 2011 – Posters' Extended Abstracts|year=2011|publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-22098-2|pages=474–478|author2=Wang, Yun |author3=Musselman, Ryan |author4=Krumm, Beverly |author5= Stephanidis, Constantine |editor=Constantine Stephanidis|chapter=Connecting Generations: Preserving Memories with Thanatosensitive Technologies|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-22098-2_95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the ways in which people use technology in practices concerning mortality, dying, and death are areas of HCI research that have historically received little attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmrussell.net/CHI2010/docs/p4477.pdf |title=HCI at the end of life: Understanding death, dying, and the digital |at=Proc. CHI 2010 Extended Abstracts, 4477-4480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although technological artefacts that address issues of the end of life are increasingly common (e.g. online memorials), academic research in this area is at an early stage.

'''The Carnival: Choreographer’s Ball''' show is the longest running dance show in [[Southern California]], [[United States]], and a popular monthly showcase of the top/elite [[choreographers]] in the world ([[video]], [[music]], and [[film]]). The show is run in [[Hollywood]], with satellite choreographer’s balls in [[Chicago]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Sydney]], [[London]], and [[Tokyo]].

The show is considered the dance community's ultimate competitive venue for choreographers to perform or display their work.&lt;ref&gt;

==Origin==
The show was created by [[Los Angeles]] choreographers' [[Carey Ysais]] and Paulette Azizian in 1998 to give working choreographers and [[dancers]] a venue where they could have free [[artistic expression]] without the constraints of an [[Musician|artist]], a [[Film director|director]], or a [[screenplay|script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Carnival Choreographers Ball 2010|title=Interview with Carey Ysais &amp; Paulette Azizian|url=http://www.danceplug.com/insidertips/interviews/carnival-choreographers-ball-2010-carey-ysais-paulette-azizian|publisher=Dance Plug|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325042106/http://www.danceplug.com/insidertips/interviews/carnival-choreographers-ball-2010-carey-ysais-paulette-azizian|archivedate=2012-03-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ysais modeled the show after a similar choreographer showcase that had run at [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s [[Glam Slam|Glam Slam nightclub]] in Los Angeles in the 1990s.

==Shows and Performance Types==
In order to be on the show, choreographers have to submit [[video tapes]] of their work in advance and/or audition, with established and elite choreographers given free access.

Performances include [[street dance]], [[popping]], [[funk]], [[hip hop]], [[tap dancing]], [[Modern dance|modern]], [[ballet]], [[lyrical dance]], [[spoken word]], and [[performance art]]. Each show has up to 14 choreographers and/or their dancers who are given up to "five minutes of freedom" to work artistically and perform before their peers.

Each performance (i.e., "piece") in the show is similar to a mini-musical, with an overall theme, props, costumes, and dance styles. Virtually any kind of dance music might be played or various music styles combined. However, many pieces are known for being edgy and provocative.

Some choreographers use the show for dance experimentation.

The first show of the year is usually an anniversary show, the latest 'The Carnival: Choreographer's Ball 14th Anniversary Show," where the dance community celebrates the year in review. Choreographer awards and/or tributes are presented to their peers, or a person or group is recognized for outstanding achievement in the field of dance or choreography, including [[Lifetime Achievement Award]]s.

==Success==
[[Talent agent]]s for movie, music, and television productions regularly attend The Carnival: Choreographer's Ball shows searching for talent. Many dancers get industry work after performing at the show. It is estimated that up to "30 percent of participating dancers get bookings" as a result of being in a Choreographer Ball show.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''TromaDance Film Festival''' is a free annual [[independent film|independent]] [[film festival]] organized by [[Troma Entertainment]]. Founded in 1999, TromaDance was originally held in [[Park City, Utah|Park City]] and [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], operating concurrently alongside the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in order to showcase an independent alternative to Sundance's perceived mainstream offerings. Between 2010 and 2013, the festival had been relocated to various locations throughout [[New Jersey]]. Since 2014, TromaDance has relocated to [[New York City]].

==Overview==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
TromaDance advertises itself as "the first and only film festival of the people, for the people, and by the people", dedicated to "bringing independent art back to the people". In direct opposition to Sundance, TromaDance doesn't charge an entry fee for filmmakers to submit their films and doesn't charge admission fees for people to attend the film screenings. Although Troma themselves are notorious for their violent low-budget [[horror film]]s, TromaDance showcases both [[short film|shorts]] and features of varying genres and formats, including [[comedy film|comedy]], [[drama film|drama]], [[documentary film|documentary]], [[animation]] and [[experimental film]], though horror, fantasy and sci-fi usually make up a significant portion of the entries.

TromaDance is primarily funded by donations, and the festival's employees and volunteers are entirely unpaid. TromaDance has been sponsored over the years by ''[[Filmmaker Magazine]]'', [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]], [[Jägermeister]], [[Kodak]], ''[[MovieMaker|MovieMaker Magazine]]'', [[PETA]], ''[[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue Magazine]]'', ''[[SLUG Magazine]]'', and [[Stella Artois]]. Troma also sponsors fan-organized events called TromaPaloozas, music festivals that serve as fundraisers for TromaDance. TromaPaloozas have been held in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]],  and [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]].

==History==
The idea for TromaDance was  developed by Troma president [[Lloyd Kaufman]], who got the idea from ''[[South Park]]'' co-creator [[Trey Parker]] (whose debut film, ''[[Cannibal! The Musical]]'', was distributed by Troma). Feeling that Sundance had become too "Hollywood" by charging high entry fees, showing multimillion-dollar "independent" movies and practicing an elitist structure and film selection process, Parker urged Kaufman to create his own film festival that was the direct independent opposite of Sundance, one that was completely free and focused on independently produced film that was made without the Hollywood system in order to give first-time filmmakers a chance at getting their work seen.

Troma has released five volumes of ''"The Best of TromaDance"'', DVDs of selected shorts each from two years worth of the festival. The press conference for the 2005 festival held in October 2004 featured the introduction of the official TromaDance Theme Song by longtime Troma character [[Count Smokula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.tromadance.com/archives/2004/10/18/press-release/|title=TromaDance News &amp; Information|publisher=www.troma.com|date=October 18, 2004|accessdate=2008-10-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011131259/http://news.tromadance.com/archives/2004/10/18/press-release/|archivedate=October 11, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victory in Europe Day''', generally known as '''V-E Day''', '''VE Day''' or simply '''V Day'''{{cn|date=December 2018}}, was celebrated on 8 May 1945 to mark the formal acceptance by the [[Allies of World War II]] of [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[unconditional surrender]] of [[Wehrmacht|its armed forces]]. The formal surrender of the German forces [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|occupying the Channel Islands]] did not occur until the following day, 9 May 1945. It thus marked the [[end of World War II in Europe]].

The term VE Day existed as early as September 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=VE Day|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=VE+Day|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in anticipation of victory. On 30 April 1945, [[Adolf Hitler]], the [[Führer|Nazi leader]], [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] during the [[Battle of Berlin]]. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorized by his successor, ''[[Reichspräsident]]'' [[Karl Dönitz]]. The administration headed by Dönitz was known as the [[Flensburg Government]]. The preliminary [[German Instrument of Surrender|act of military surrender]] was signed on 7 May in [[Reims]], [[France]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Charles|year=1996|title=Leaders &amp; Personalities of the Third Reich, Vol. 2|location=San José, CA|publisher=R. James Bender Publishing|isbn=978-0-912138-66-4|ref=harv|pp=285, 286}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the final document was signed on 8 May in [[Berlin]], Germany.

The former Soviet Union, Serbia, Israel, and [[Eastern Bloc]] countries have historically celebrated the end of World War II on 9 May. In [[Ukraine]] since 2015, 8 May is designated as a [[Victory Day over Nazism in World War II|day of Remembrance and Reconciliation]], but it is not a public holiday.&lt;ref name="Victory in Europe Day"&gt;{{cite web|title=Victory in Europe Day|url=http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/france/ve_day.php|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unian.info/society/1912153-ukraine-]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the western world. From [[Moscow]] to Los Angeles, people celebrated.

In the [[United Kingdom]], more than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in [[Trafalgar Square]] and up [[The Mall (London)|the Mall]] to [[Buckingham Palace]], where King [[George VI]] and Queen [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth]], accompanied by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]] were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://branches.britishlegion.org.uk/branches/dunmow/ve-day] The Royal British Legion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simcoe.ca/Archives/Pages/V-E-Day.aspx|title=VE Day|last=|first=|date=|website=www.simcoe.ca|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the victory happened on President [[Harry Truman]]'s 61st birthday.&lt;ref name="TrumanBirthday"/&gt; He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, [[Franklin D.

Massive celebrations also took place in [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Miami]] and especially in [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Times Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/qt/v-eday.html |title=V-E Day |accessdate=August 20, 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515065523/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/qt/v-eday.html |archivedate=May 15, 2008 }} University of San Diego, archived May 15, 2008 from http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/ww2Timeline/qt/v-eday.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Victory Day==
{{main|Victory Day (9 May)}}

The instrument of surrender stipulated that all hostilities had to stop at 23:01 ([[Central European Time|CET]]), 8th of May, just an hour before midnight. Since it was already 9th of May in the European part of the USSR, most post-Soviet states, including Russia, as well as Israel commemorate [[Victory Day (Eastern Europe)|Victory Day]] on 9 May instead of 8 May.

'''''Weekly''''' is an English-language national [[news magazine]] published by the La Sentinelle Group in [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasentinelle.mu/spip.php?article90|title=La Sentinelle|website=La Sentinelle|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine, which only exists on paper and direct-email [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], has a relatively low readership, but is considered one of the most important sources of political news on the island.{{by whom|date=September 2016}} The magazine is known both for its news reporting, as well as its critical and often mocking editorials.

==History and profile==
It was started as a weekly section, named Outlook, of ''[[L'Express (Mauritius)|L'Express]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="nir"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nirmal Kumar Betchoo|title=French language in Mauritian newspapers: A Cultural Exception in Journalism|journal=International Journal for Research in Social Science and Humanities Research|date=February 2016|volume=2|issue=2|url=http://internationaljournalsforresearch.com/Pdf/International%20Journal%20for%20Research%20in%20Social%20Science%20and%20Humanities%20Research/International%20Journal%20for%20Research%20in%20Social%20Science%20and%20Humanities%20Research-Feb-7.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a weekly magazine in July 2012.&lt;ref name="nir"/&gt; The magazine is published on Fridays.&lt;ref name="nir"/&gt; The [[editor-in-chief]], Touria Prayag, was temporarily banned from [[Parliament of Mauritius|Mauritian Parliament]] in 2016 by its speaker, [[Maya Hanoomanjee]], because of a critical editorial published in ''Weekly'' on 28 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/article/283584/apres-un-editorial-touria-prayag-interdite-dacces-au-parlement|title=Après un éditorial: Touria Prayag interdite d'accès au Parlement|last=Deena|first=Manisha|date=14 June 2016|work=|publisher=La Sentinelle|newspaper=L'Express|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zoophilia''' is a [[paraphilia]] involving a sexual fixation on non-human animals. '''Bestiality''' is [[Cross-species sex|cross-species sexual activity]] between [[human]] and non-human [[animals]]. The terms are often used interchangeably, but some researchers make a distinction between the attraction (zoophilia) and the act (bestiality).&lt;ref name="ranger"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Ranger |first1=R. |last2=Fedoroff |first2=P. | year = 2014 | title = Commentary: Zoophilia and the Law | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 421–426 | url = http://www.jaapl.org/content/42/4/421.full | pmid = 25492067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sex with animals [[Zoophilia and the law|is not outlawed in some countries]], in most countries, bestiality is illegal under [[cruelty to animals|animal abuse]] laws or laws dealing with [[buggery]] or [[crime against nature|crimes against nature]].

== Terminology ==
===General===
Three key terms commonly used in regards to the subject — ''zoophilia'', ''bestiality'', and ''zoosexuality'' — are often used somewhat interchangeably. Some researchers distinguish between zoophilia (as a persistent sexual interest in animals) and bestiality (as sexual acts with animals), because bestiality is often not driven by a sexual preference for animals.&lt;ref name="ranger" /&gt; Some studies have found that a preference for animals is rare among people who engage in sexual contact with animals.&lt;ref name="earls"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/107906320201400106 |pmid=11803597 |title=A Case Study of Preferential Bestiality (Zoophilia) |year=2002 |last1=Earls |first1=C. M. |last2=Lalumiere |first2=M. L. |journal=Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=83–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some zoophiles report that they have never had sexual contact with an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maratea, R. J. | year = 2011 | title = Screwing the pooch: Legitimizing accounts in a zoophilia on-line community | journal = Deviant Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 10 | page = 938 | doi=10.1080/01639625.2010.538356}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with zoophilia are known as "zoophiles", though also sometimes as "zoosexuals", or even very simply "zoos".&lt;ref name="ranger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Handbookth"&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=G_MwT9OHj4AC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=zoophilia#v=onepage&amp;q=zoophilia&amp;f=false | title = The International Handbook of Animal Abuse and Cruelty: Theory, Research, and Application | chapter = Bestiality and Zoophilia: A Discussion of Sexual Contact With Animals | isbn = 978-1-55753-565-8 | editor = Ascione, Frank | author = Beetz, Andrea M. | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zooerasty, [[sodomy]], and zooerastia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=zooerastia definition|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zooerastia|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are other terms closely related to the subject but are less synonymous with the former terms, and are seldom used. "Bestiosexuality" was discussed briefly by Allen (1979), but never became widely established.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} [[Ernest Bornemann]] (1990, cited by Rosenbauer, 1997) coined the separate term ''[[zoosadism]]'' for those who derive pleasure – sexual or otherwise – from inflicting pain on animals. Zoosadism specifically is one member of the [[Macdonald triad]] of precursors to [[Psychopathy|sociopathic behavior]].&lt;ref name=MacDonald&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=J. M.|title=The Threat to Kill|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1963|volume=120|issue=2|pages=125–30|url=http://journals.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=149172|accessdate=19 January 2013|format=PDF|doi=10.1176/ajp.120.2.125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoophilia===
The term ''zoophilia'' was introduced into the field of research on sexuality in ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' (1886) by [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing]], who described a number of cases of "violation of animals (bestiality)",&lt;ref&gt;Richard von Krafft-Ebing: [[Psychopathia Sexualis]], p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "zoophilia erotica",&lt;ref&gt;Richard von Krafft-Ebing: [[Psychopathia Sexualis]], p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; which he defined as a sexual attraction to animal skin or fur. The term ''zoophilia'' derives from the combination of two nouns in [[Greek language|Greek]]: '''''ζῷον''''' (''zṓion'', meaning "animal") and '''''φιλία''''' (''[[wiktionary:-philia|philia]]'', meaning "(fraternal) love"). In general contemporary usage, the term ''zoophilia'' may refer to sexual activity between human and non-human animals, the desire to engage in such, or to the specific [[paraphilia]] (''i.e.,'' the atypical arousal) which indicates a definite preference for non-human animals over humans as sexual partners. Although Krafft-Ebing also coined the term ''zooerasty'' for the paraphilia of exclusive sexual attraction to animals,&lt;ref name="deviance 391"&gt;D. Richard Laws and William T. O'Donohue: [https://books.google.com/books?id=yIXG9FuqbaIC&amp;pg=PA391&amp;dq=zoophilia+paraphilia Books.Google.co.uk], Sexual Deviance, page 391. [[Guilford Press]], 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-59385-605-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that term has fallen out of general use.

===Zoosexuality===
[[File:Tako to ama retouched.jpg|thumb|right|[[Katsushika Hokusai|Hokusai]]&lt;!--Katsushika is the family name so it is put first, BUT he is called by his given name--&gt;'s (1760–1849) ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]''.]]

The term ''zoosexual'' was proposed by [[Hani Miletski]] in 2002&lt;ref name="Handbookth"/&gt; as a value-neutral term. Usage of ''zoosexual'' as a noun (in reference to a person) is synonymous with zoophile, while the adjectival form of the word – as, for instance, in the phrase "zoosexual act" – may indicate sexual activity between a human and a non-human animal. The derivative noun "zoosexuality" is sometimes used by self-identified zoophiles in both support groups and on internet-based discussion forums to designate [[sexual orientation]] manifesting as romantic or emotional involvement with, or sexual attraction to, non-human animals.&lt;ref name="Handbookth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is zoosexuality|url=http://zoosexuality.org/?id=1|website=Zoosexuality.org|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bestiality===
[[File:日本春宫册页《女人和狗》.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Japanese ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' [[woodblock print]] from [[Kunisada|Utagawa Kunisada]]'s series, "Eight Canine Heroes of the House of Satomi", 1837. ]]
[[File:Indiaerotic5.jpg|thumb|right|350px|An 18th-century Indian miniature depicting women practising zoophilia in the bottom register.]]
The legal term ''bestiality'' has three common pronunciations: {{IPA|[ˌbestʃiˈæləti]}} or {{IPA|[ˌbistʃiˈæləti]}} in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pronunciation of bestiality|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/american/bestiality|publisher=MacMillan Dictionary|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IPA|[ˌbestiˈæləti]}} in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pronunciation of bestiality|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/british/bestiality|publisher=MacMillan Dictionary|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some zoophiles and researchers draw a distinction between ''zoophilia'' and ''bestiality'', using the former to describe the desire to form sexual relationships with animals, and the latter to describe the sex acts alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexuality.about.com/od/glossary/g/zoophilia.htm |title=Sexuality.about.com |website=Sexuality.about.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confusing the matter yet further, writing in 1962, Masters used the term ''bestialist'' specifically in his discussion of zoosadism.

Stephanie LaFarge, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New Jersey Medical School, and Director of Counseling at the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|ASPCA]], writes that two groups can be distinguished: bestialists, who rape or abuse animals, and zoophiles, who form an emotional and sexual attachment to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All Opposed, Say Neigh |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/1999-12-15/news/all-opposed-say-neigh/ |author=Melinda Roth |work=Riverfront Times |date=15 December 1991 |accessdate=24 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin J. Williams]] and [[Martin Weinberg]] studied self-defined zoophiles via the internet and reported them as understanding the term ''zoophilia'' to involve concern for the animal's welfare, pleasure, and consent, as distinct from the self-labelled zoophiles' concept of "bestialists", whom the zoophiles in their study defined as focused on their own gratification. Williams and Weinberg also quoted a British newspaper saying that ''zoophilia'' is a term used by "apologists" for ''bestiality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams CJ, Weinberg MS |title=Zoophilia in men: a study of sexual interest in animals |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=523–35 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14574096 |doi=10.1023/A:1026085410617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent of occurrence==
The [[Kinsey report]]s rated the percentage of people who had sexual interaction with animals at some point in their lives as 8% for men and 3.6% for women, and claimed it was 40–50% in people living near farms,&lt;ref name="deviance 391" /&gt; but some later writers dispute the figures, because the study lacked a random sample in that it included a disproportionate number of prisoners, causing [[sampling bias]]. [[Martin Duberman]] has written that it is difficult to get a random sample in sexual research, and that even when [[Paul Gebhard]], Kinsey's research successor, removed prison samples from the figures, he found the figures were not significantly changed.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Duberman: [http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/publications/duberman.html KinseyInstitute.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111215816/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/publications/duberman.html |date=11 January 2009 }}, Kinsey's Urethra ''The Nation,'' 3 November 1997, pp. 40–43. Review of ''Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life.'' By James H. Jones.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, the farm population in the USA had declined by 80 percent compared with 1940, reducing the opportunity to live with animals; Hunt's 1974 study suggests that these demographic changes led to a significant change in reported occurrences of bestiality. The percentage of males who reported sexual interactions with animals in 1974 was 4.9% (1948: 8.3%), and in females in 1974 was 1.9% (1953: 3.6%). Miletski believes this is not due to a reduction in interest but merely a reduction in opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt 1974, cited and re-examined by Miletski (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Friday]]'s 1973 book on [[female sexuality]], ''[[My Secret Garden]]'', comprised around 190 fantasies from different women; of these, 23 involve zoophilic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy Friday|title=My Secret Garden|publisher=Simon and Schuster|edition=Revised|year=1998|isbn=978-0-671-01987-7|pages=180–185|chapter=What do women fantasize about? The Zoo|origyear=1973|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J9ZKmplu4agC&amp;pg=PA180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, psychiatric patients were found to have a statistically significant higher prevalence rate (55 percent) of reported bestiality, both actual sexual contacts (45 percent) and sexual fantasy (30 percent) than the control groups of medical in-patients (10 percent) and psychiatric staff (15 percent).&lt;ref name="psych"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1778686 |year=1991 |last1=Alvarez |first1=WA |last2=Freinhar |first2=JP |title=A prevalence study of bestiality (zoophilia) in psychiatric in-patients, medical in-patients, and psychiatric staff |volume=38 |issue=1–4 |pages=45–7 |journal=International Journal of Psychosomatics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crépault and Couture (1980) reported that 5.3 percent of the men they surveyed had fantasized about sexual activity with an animal during heterosexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01542159 |title=Men's erotic fantasies |year=1980 |last1=Crépault |first1=Claude |last2=Couture |first2=Marcel |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=565–81 |pmid=7458662}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 study, 3% of women and 2.2% of men reported fantasies about having sex with an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Joyal |first1=C.

{{anchor|Faunoiphilia}}
Sexual arousal from watching animals mate is known as ''faunoiphilia''.&lt;ref&gt;Aggrawal, Anil. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=faunoiphilia&amp;f=false Forensic and medico-legal aspects of sexual crimes and unusual sexual practices]. CRC Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A frequent interest in and sexual excitement at watching animals [[mating|mate]] is cited as an indicator of latent zoophilia by Massen (1994). [[Sexual fantasy|Sexual fantasies]] about zoophilic acts can occur in people who do not have any wish to experience them in real life. Nancy Friday notes that zoophilia as a fantasy may provide an escape from cultural expectations, restrictions, and judgements in regard to sex. Masters (1962) says that some brothel madams used to stage exhibitions of animals mating, as they found it aroused potential clientele, and that this may have encouraged the clients to engage in bestiality.&lt;ref name="watching"&gt;R.E.L. Masters: ''Forbidden Sexual behavior and Morality.'' New York, NY 1962, Lancer Books, Inc. (Section "Psychical bestiality").&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|Where in the book does it say that?

==Perspectives on zoophilia==
[[File:Franz von Bayros 020.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Art by [[Franz von Bayros]] depicting [[oral sex]] between an adolescent and a [[deer]]]]

=== Research perspectives ===
Zoophilia has been partly discussed by several sciences: [[Psychology]] (the study of the human [[mind]]), [[sexology]] (a relatively new discipline primarily studying [[human sexuality]]), [[ethology]] (the study of [[ethology|animal behavior]]), and [[anthrozoology]] (the study of human-animal interactions and bonds).

The nature of animal minds, animal [[mental process]]es and structures, and animal [[self-awareness]], [[perception]], [[emotion in animals]], and "map of the world", are studied within [[animal cognition]] and also explored within various specialized branches of [[neuroscience]] such as [[neuroethology]].

In the fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-5), zoophilia is placed in the classification "other specified paraphilic disorder"&lt;ref name="DSM 5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder, 302.89 (F65.89) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | page = 705}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("[[paraphilia]]s not otherwise specified" in the DSM-III and IV&lt;ref name=DSM&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[World Health Organization]] takes the same position, listing a sexual preference for animals in its [[ICD]][[ICD-10|-10]] as "other disorder of sexual preference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10, F65.8 Other disorders of sexual preference |website=Who.int |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the DSM-5, it rises to the level of a diagnosable disorder only when accompanied by distress or interference with normal functioning.&lt;ref name="DSM 5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miletski | first1 = H | year = 2015| title = Zoophilia – Implications for Therapy | url = | journal = JSET | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 85–86 | doi=10.1080/01614576.2001.11074387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoophilia may also be covered to some degree by other fields such as ethics, philosophy, law, [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]]. It may also be touched upon by [[sociology]] which looks both at zoosadism in examining patterns and issues related to [[sexual abuse]] and at non-sexual zoophilia in examining the role of animals as emotional support and companionship in human lives, and may fall within the scope of [[psychiatry]] if it becomes necessary to consider its significance in a clinical context.
The Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine (Vol. 18, February 2011) states that sexual contact with animals is almost never a clinically significant problem by itself;&lt;ref name="scidirectpii"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2011.01.004 |title=A new classification of zoophilia |year=2011 |last1=Aggrawal |first1=Anil |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=73–8 |pmid=21315301}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also states that there are several kinds of zoophiles:&lt;ref name="scidirectpii"/&gt;

Additionally, zoophiles in categories 2, 3, and 8 (romantic zoophiles, zoophilic fantasizers, and regular zoophiles) are the most common, while zoophiles found in categories 6 and 7 (sadistic bestials and opportunistic zoophiles) are the least common.&lt;ref name="scidirectpii"/&gt;

Zoophilia may reflect childhood experimentation, sexual abuse or lack of other avenues of sexual expression. Exclusive desire for animals rather than humans is considered a rare paraphilia, and sufferers often have other paraphilias&lt;ref name="LawsO'Donohue2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.

The first detailed studies of zoophilia date from prior to 1910. Peer reviewed research into zoophilia in its own right started around 1960. However, a number of the most oft-quoted studies, such as Miletski, were not published in [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] journals. There have been several significant modern books, from Masters (1962) to Beetz (2002);&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.4 – 5.2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; their research arrived at the following conclusions:

:*Most zoophiles have (or have also had) long term human relationships as well or at the same time as zoosexual ones, and that zoosexual partners are usually dogs and/or horses (Masters, Miletski, Beetz)&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggrawal2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anil Aggrawal|title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=zoophilia+most+common+animal#PPA258|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=December 22, 2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-4309-9|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Zoophiles' emotions and care for animals can be real, relational, authentic and (within animals' abilities) reciprocal, and not just a substitute or means of expression.&lt;ref&gt;(Masters, Miletski, Weinberg, Beetz)&lt;/ref&gt; Beetz believes zoophilia is not an inclination which is chosen.&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt;
:* Society in general at present is considerably misinformed about zoophilia, its stereotypes, and its meaning.&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt; The distinction between zoophilia and zoosadism is a critical one to these researchers, and is highlighted by each of these studies. Masters (1962), Miletski (1999) and Weinberg (2003) each comment significantly on the social harm caused by misunderstandings regarding zoophilia: "This destroy[s] the lives of many citizens".&lt;ref name="Beetz2002"/&gt;

Beetz also states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The phenomenon of sexual contact with animals is starting to lose its taboo: it is appearing more often in scholarly publications, and the public are being confronted with it, too.[...] Sexual contact with animals – in the form of bestiality or zoophilia – needs to be discussed more openly and investigated in more detail by scholars working in disciplines such as animal ethics, animal behavior, anthrozoology, psychology, mental health, sociology, and the law."&lt;ref name="BeetzPodberseck"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony L. Podberscek|author2=Andrea M. Beetz|title=Bestiality and Zoophilia: Sexual Relations with Animals|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z-GbOvrbniQC&amp;lpg=PT91&amp;dq=beetz%202002%20zoophilia&amp;pg=PT94#v=onepage&amp;q=beetz%202002%20zoophilia&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=September 1, 2005|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-0-85785-222-9|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More recently, research has engaged three further directions – the speculation that at least some animals seem to enjoy a zoophilic relationship assuming [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]] is not present, and can form an affectionate bond.&lt;ref&gt;Masters, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar findings are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals on the internet is often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how to identify what is perceived as [[consent]] beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals do things for pleasure. But he himself says pet owners will be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jonathan Balcombe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/29/animalbehaviour.evolution |title=Animals can be happy too |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 May 2012 |location=London |date=29 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beetz described the phenomenon of zoophilia/bestiality as being somewhere between crime, paraphilia and love, although she says that most research has been based on [[criminology|criminological]] reports, so the cases have frequently involved violence and psychiatric illness. She says only a few recent studies have taken data from volunteers in the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scie-socialcareonline.org.uk/profile.asp?guid=fac3acab-5377-4f9a-a9f0-007248ee2e43 Scie-SocialCareOnline.org.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115133416/http://www.scie-socialcareonline.org.uk/profile.asp?guid=fac3acab-5377-4f9a-a9f0-007248ee2e43 |date=15 November 2010 }} Bestiality/Zoophilia: A Scarcely-Investigated Phenomenon Between Crime, Paraphilia, and Love&lt;/ref&gt; As with all volunteer surveys and sexual ones in particular, these studies have a potential for [[self-selection]] bias.&lt;ref name="Slade2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph W.

Medical research suggests that some zoophiles only become aroused by a specific species (such as horses), some zoophiles become aroused by multiple species (which may or may not include humans), and some zoophiles are not attracted to humans at all.&lt;ref name="earls" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15895645 |year=2005 |last1=Bhatia |first1=MS |last2=Srivastava |first2=S |last3=Sharma |first3=S |title=1.

Several cultures built temples ([[Khajuraho]], India) or other structures ([[Sagaholm]], [[tumulus|barrow]], Sweden) with zoophilic carvings on the exterior, however at [[Khajuraho]] these depictions are not on the interior, perhaps depicting that these are things that belong to the profane world rather than the spiritual world, and thus are to be left outside.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In the Church-oriented culture of the [[Middle Ages]] zoophilic activity was met with execution, typically burning, and death to the animals involved either the same way or by hanging, as "both a violation of [[Religion and sexuality|Biblical edicts]] and a degradation of man as a spiritual being rather than one that is purely animal and carnal."&lt;ref&gt;Masters (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Some witches were accused of having congress with the devil in the form of an animal. As with all accusations and confessions extracted under torture in the [[witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], their validity cannot be ascertained.&lt;ref name="BulloughBullough1994"/&gt;

===Religious perspectives===
Passages in [[Leviticus 18]] (Lev 18:23: "And you shall not lie with any beast and defile yourself with it, neither shall any woman give herself to a beast to lie with it: it is a perversion." RSV) and 20:15–16 ("If a man lies with a beast, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the beast. If a woman approaches any beast and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them." RSV) are cited by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theologians as categorical denunciation of bestiality. However, the teachings of the [[New Testament]] have been interpreted by some as not expressly forbidding bestiality.&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Plummer |first=Keith |title=To beast or not to beast: does the law of Christ forbid zoophilia? |year=2001 |url=http://place.asburyseminary.edu/trenpapers/892 |conference=53rd National Conference of the Evangelical Theological Society |location=Colorado Springs, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part II of his [[Summa Theologica]], medieval philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] ranked various "unnatural vices" (sex acts resulting in "venereal pleasure" rather than procreation) by degrees of sinfulness, concluding that "the most grievous is the sin of bestiality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/aquinas-homo.html Fordham.edu] Aquinas on Unnatural Sex&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christian theologians extend [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]'s view that [[Antithesis of the Law#Adultery|even having thoughts of adultery is sinful]] to imply that thoughts of committing bestial acts are likewise sinful.

There are a few references in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] scriptures to religious figures engaging in symbolic sexual activity with animals such as explicit depictions of people having sex with animals included amongst the thousands of sculptures of "Life events" on the exterior of the [[Hindu temple|temple complex]] at [[Khajuraho]]. The depictions are largely symbolic depictions of the sexualization of some animals and are not meant to be taken literally.&lt;ref&gt;The Critical and Cultural Study of the Shatapatha Brahmana by Swami Satya Prakash Saraswati, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Hindu tradition of erotic painting and sculpture, having sex with an animal is believed to be actually a human having sex with a God incarnated in the form of an animal.&lt;ref name="PodberscekBeetz2005"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Anthony L. |last1=Podberscek |first2=Andrea M. |last2=Beetz |title=Bestiality and Zoophilia: Sexual Relations with Animals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-GbOvrbniQC&amp;pg=PT12 |accessdate=4 January 2013 |date=1 September 2005 |publisher=Berg |isbn=978-0-85785-222-9 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some Hindu scriptures, such as the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' and the ''[[Devi Bhagavata Purana]]'', having sex with animals, especially the cow, leads one to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Hell]], where one is tormented by having one's body rubbed on trees with razor-sharp thorns.&lt;ref name = "mani"&gt;{{cite book|author = Mani, Vettam|title = Puranic Encyclopaedia: A Comprehensive Dictionary With Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|year = 1975|location = Delhi|isbn = 978-0-8426-0822-0|oclc=2198347|pages = 368–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions, all forms of zoophilic acts are prohibited; others outlaw only the mistreatment of animals, without specific mention of sexual activity. In the United Kingdom, [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] (also known as the Extreme Pornography Act) outlaws images of a person performing or appearing to perform an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive).&lt;ref name=opsisect63&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/section/63|work=Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|title=Section 63 – Possession of extreme pornographic images|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[United Kingdom Ministry of Justice|UK Ministry of Justice]]'s explanatory note on extreme images saying "It is not a question of the intentions of those who produced the image.

Laws on zoophilia are sometimes triggered by specific incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Fischer: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080515222156/http://www.azstarnet.com/allheadlines/122006 Lawmakers hope to outlaw bestiality], 
''Arizona Daily Star,'' 28 March 2006. In Arizona, the motive for legislation was a "spate of recent cases."&lt;/ref&gt; While some laws are very specific, others employ vague terms such as "[[sodomy]]" or "bestiality", which lack legal precision and leave it unclear exactly which acts are covered. In the past, some bestiality laws may have been made in the belief that sex with an animal could result in monstrous offspring, as well as offending the community. Current anti-cruelty laws focus more specifically on animal welfare while anti-bestiality laws are aimed only at offenses to community "standards".&lt;ref name="posner"&gt;Posner, Richard, A Guide to America's Sex Laws, The [[University of Chicago Press]], 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-226-67564-0}}. Page 207.&lt;/ref&gt;
Notable legal views include Sweden, where a 2005 report by the Swedish Animal Welfare Agency for the government expressed concern over the increase in reports of [[horse-ripping]] incidents. The agency believed current animal cruelty legislation was not sufficient in protecting animals from abuse and needed updating, but concluded that on balance it was not appropriate to call for a ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=1357 |title=TheLocal.se |publisher=TheLocal.se |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515124451/http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=1357 |archivedate=15 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Zealand]], the 1989 Crimes Bill considered abolishing bestiality as a criminal offense, and instead viewing it as a mental health issue, but they did not, and people can still be prosecuted for it.

Pornography involving sex with animals is widely illegal, even in most countries where bestiality itself is not explicitly outlawed.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In the [[United States]], zoophilic pornography would be considered [[obscene]] if it did not meet the standards of the [[Miller Test]] and therefore is not openly sold, mailed, distributed or imported across state boundaries or within states which prohibit it. Under U.S. law, 'distribution' includes transmission across the Internet. Production and mere possession appears to be legal, however. U.S. prohibitions on distribution of sexual or obscene materials are {{As of|2005|lc=on}} in some doubt, having been ruled [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] in ''[[United States v. Extreme Associates]]'' (a judgement which was overturned on appeal, December 2005).

Similar restrictions apply in Germany (see [[Zoophilia#Legal status|above]]). In [[New Zealand]] the possession, making or distribution of material promoting bestiality is illegal.

The potential use of media for [[pornographic movie]]s was seen from the start of the era of [[silent film]]. ''Polissons and Galipettes'' (re-released 2002 as "[[The Good Old Naughty Days]]") is a collection of early French silent films for brothel use, including some animal pornography, dating from around 1905 – 1930.

Material featuring sex with animals is widely available on the Internet, due to its ease of production.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Prior to the advent of mass-market magazines such as [[Playboy]], so-called [[Tijuana Bible]]s were a form of pornographic tract popular in America, sold as anonymous underground publications typically comprising a small number of stapled comic-strips representing characters and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;An example digitized Tijuana Bible entitled ''The Pet'' from the 1960s is linked at [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=detail&amp;item=TB073&amp;fullsize=0 tijuanabibles.org page link] (also see [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi/hzpi/u/HzSt031FT7pj.ctu7.2/hazel.cgi?action=detail&amp;item=TB073&amp;fullsize=1 full size] and [http://tijuanabibles.org/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=SEARCH&amp;SEARCH_SPEC=bestiality&amp;SUBMIT_ACTION_SEARCH=Search search]).&lt;/ref&gt;
The promotion of "stars" began with the Danish [[Bodil Joensen]], in the period of 1969–72, along with other porn actors such as the Americans [[Linda Lovelace]] (''Dogarama'', 1969), Chessie Moore (multiple films, c. 1994), Kerri Downs (three films, 1998) and Calina Lynx (aka Kelly G'raffe) (two films, 1998). Another early film to attain great infamy was "[[Animal Farm (video)|Animal Farm]]", smuggled into Great Britain around 1980 without details as to makers or provenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dark Side of Porn Season 2 (2006) - Documentary / TV-Show|url=http://crimedocumentary.com/dark-side-porn-season-2-2006/|website=Crimedocumentary.com|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later traced to a crude juxtaposition of smuggled cuts from many of Bodil Joensen's 1970s Danish movies.

Into the 1980s the Dutch took the lead, creating figures like "Wilma" and the "Dutch Sisters". In the 1980s, "bestiality" was featured in Italian adult films with actresses like Denise Dior, Francesca Ray, and [[Marina Hedman]], manifested early in the softcore flick ''Bestialità'' in 1976.

Today, in [[Hungary]], where production faces no legal limitations, zoophilic materials have become a substantial industry that produces numerous films and magazines, particularly for Dutch companies such as ''Topscore'' and ''Book &amp; Film International'', and the [[genre]] has stars such as "Hector", a [[Great Dane]] starring in several films. Many Hungarian mainstream performers also appeared anonymously in animal pornography in their early careers. For example, Suzy Spark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurobabeindex.com/sbandoindex/suzyspark.html EuroBabeIndex.com], Suzy Spark&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, animal pornography is used to bypass censorship laws, often featuring Japanese and Swedish{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} female models performing [[fellatio]] on animals, because oral penetration of a non-human penis is not in the scope of Japanese mosaic censor. Sakura Sakurada is an [[AV idol]] known to have appeared in animal pornography, specifically in the AV ''The Dog Game'' in 2006. While primarily underground, there are a number of animal pornography actresses who specialize in bestiality movies. A box-office success of the 1980s, ''[[24 Horas de Sexo Explícito]]'' featured zoophilia.

In the UK [[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] criminalises possession of realistic pornographic images depicting sex with animals (see [[extreme pornography]]), including fake images and simulated acts, as well as images depicting sex with dead animals, where no crime has taken place in the production. The law provides for sentences of up to two years in prison; a sentence of 12 months was handed down in one case in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2086306_acts_of_depravity_found_on_dads_computer ‘Acts of depravity’ found on dad’s computer], ''[[Reading Post]]'', 26 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography of this sort has become the business of certain [[spam (electronic)|spammers]] such as [[Jeremy Jaynes]] and owners of some fake [[Thumbnail gallery post|TGP]]s, who use the promise of "extreme" material as a bid for users' attention.

==Health and safety==
{{Main article|Zoonosis}}
Infections that are transmitted from animals to humans are called [[Zoonosis|zoonoses]]. Some zoonoses may be transferred through casual contact, but others are much more readily transferred by activities that expose humans to the [[semen]], vaginal fluids, [[urine]], [[saliva]], [[feces]] and blood of animals. Examples of zoonoses are [[Brucellosis]], [[Q fever]], [[leptospirosis]], and [[toxocariasis]]. Therefore, sexual activity with animals is, in some instances, a high risk activity. [[Allergy|Allergic reactions]] to animal semen may occur, including [[anaphylaxis]]. Bites and other trauma from penetration or trampling may occur.

==Zoophiles==

=== Non-sexual zoophilia ===
The love of animals is not necessarily sexual in nature. In [[psychology]] and [[sociology]] the word "zoophilia" is sometimes used without sexual implications. Being fond of animals in general, or as pets, is accepted in Western society, and is usually respected or tolerated. However, the word zoophilia is used to mean a sexual preference towards animals, which makes it &lt;ref name="CraigheadNemeroff2002"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=W. Edward Craighead|editor2=Charles B. Nemeroff|title=The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JQMRmyOfpJ8C&amp;dq=zoophilia+meaning&amp;q=zoophilia+meaning#v=snippet&amp;q=zoophilia%20meaning&amp;f=false|date=November 11, 2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-27083-6|page=1050}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[paraphilia]]. Some zoophiles may not act on their sexual attraction to animals. People who identify as zoophiles may feel their love for animals is romantic rather than purely sexual, and say this makes them different from those committing entirely sexually motivated acts of bestiality.&lt;ref name="Delaney2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Delaney|title=Law and Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjqWw-9ZQfYC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=zoophilia+romantic|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43700-4|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoophile community===
[[File:Zeta toy MMB 01.jpg|thumb|right|Several companies (e.g., Bad Dragon) sell [[dildo]]s in the shape of animal penises, both realistic and fantastical. This one is based on a [[wolf's penis]].]]
An online survey which recruited participants over the internet concluded that prior to the arrival of widespread [[computer network]]ing, most zoophiles would not have known other zoophiles, and for the most part, zoophiles engaged in bestiality secretly, or told only trusted friends, family or partners. The internet and its predecessors made people able to search for information on topics which were not otherwise easily accessible and to communicate with relative safety and anonymity. Because of the diary-like intimacy of blogs and the anonymity of the internet, zoophiles had the ideal opportunity to "openly" express their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Montclair, 1997, cited by Miletski, 1999, p .35.&lt;/ref&gt; As with many other [[alternative lifestyle|alternate lifestyles]], broader networks began forming in the 1980s when participating in [[online community|networked social groups]] became more common at home and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Weinberg and Williams"&gt;Weinberg and Williams&lt;/ref&gt; Such developments in general were described by Markoff in 1990; the linking of computers meant that people thousands of miles apart could feel the intimacy akin to being in a small village together.&lt;ref&gt;Markoff, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The popular newsgroup [[alt.sex|alt.sex.bestiality]], said to be in the top 1% of newsgroup interest (i.e. number 50 out of around 5000), – and reputedly started in humor&lt;ref&gt;Miletski p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; – along with personal [[bulletin board]]s and [[talker]]s, chief among them [[Sleepy's multiple worlds]], [[Lintilla (talker)|Lintilla]], and Planes of Existence, were among the first group media of this kind&lt;!-- Clarify: Of what kind? Of all internet groups? Or of zoophilia-related internet groups? --&gt; in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These groups rapidly drew together zoophiles, some of whom also created personal and social websites and [[Internet Forum|internet forums]]. By around 1992–1994, the wide social net had evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Miletski (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This was initially centered around the above-mentioned [[newsgroup]], alt.sex.bestiality, which during the six years following 1990 had matured into a discussion and support group.&lt;ref&gt;Milteski (1999), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andriette, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montclair, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The newsgroup included information about health issues, laws governing zoophilia, bibliography relating to the subject, and community events.&lt;ref&gt;Donofrio, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, other zoophile websites have been created and have grown in size; for example, the zoophile website and internet forum "beastforum.com" has more than one million members as of March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.big-boards.com/board/1626/ |title=Beast Forum statistics |publisher=Big-boards.com |accessdate=14 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106122801/http://www.big-boards.com/board/1626/ |archivedate=6 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beastforum.com |title=The Worlds Largest Bestiality Board |publisher=BeastForum.com |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinberg and Williams observe that the internet can socially integrate an incredibly large number of people. In Kinsey’s day contacts between animal lovers were more localized and limited to male compatriots in a particular rural community. Further, while the farm boys Kinsey researched might have been part of a rural culture in which sex with animals was a part, the sex itself did not define the community. The zoophile community is not known to be particularly large compared to other subcultures which make use of the internet, so Weinberg and Williams surmised its aims and beliefs would likely change little as it grew. Those particularly active on the internet may not be aware of a wider subculture, as there is not much of a wider subculture{{clarify|date=December 2011}}, Weinberg and Williams felt the virtual zoophile group would lead the development of the subculture.&lt;ref name="Weinberg and Williams"/&gt;

There also exist websites which aim to provide support and social assistance to zoophiles (including resources to help and rescue abused or mistreated animals), but these are not usually well publicized. Such work is often undertaken as needed by individuals and friends, within social networks, and by word of mouth. One notable early attempt at creating a zoophile support structure focused on social and psychological support was the newsgroup soc.support.zoophilia, which was proposed in 1994 but narrowly failed to meet the 2/3 majority needed to be created{{clarify|date=December 2011}}. There was also a German support group called "Interessengemeinschaft Zoophiler Menschen ("Zoophile Interest Group").&lt;ref&gt;Miletski (1999), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoophiles tend to experience their first zoosexual feelings during adolescence, and tend to be secretive about it, hence limiting the ability for non-Internet communities to form:&lt;ref name="browplm2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Francis |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2009-08-20/news/those-who-practice-bestiality-say-they-re-part-of-the-next-gay-rights-movement/2/ |title=Those Who Practice Bestiality Say They're Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement – Page 2 – News – Broward/Palm Beach – New Times Broward-Palm Beach |publisher=Broward/Palm Beach |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I asked him [a zoophile] when he had his first inkling of being a zoophile. 'When you're a kid, you're not really aware of too much sexually,' he says. 'But I was always interested in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He's a male. I'm a male. I wanted to make him feel good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I was the only one who did this,' James says. 'I felt like there was no one I could talk to about this. I definitely knew I wasn't going to be talking to my parents or my friends about this.'[...] 'This is not a fetish,' James says of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'"&lt;ref name="browplm2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Arguments for and against zoosexual activity from a variety of sources, including religious, moral, ethical, psychological, medical and social.

=== Arguments against bestiality ===
Bestiality is seen by the government of the United Kingdom as profoundly disturbed behavior (as indicated by the UK [[Home Office]] review on sexual offences in 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm56/5668/5668.pdf |title=Protecting the Public: Strengthening Protection Against Sex Offenders and Reforming the Laws on Sexual Offences |chapter=Other offences |pages=32–3 |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-10-156682-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20131205100653/http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm56/5668/5668.pdf |archivedate=5 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Beetz states there is evidence that there can be violent zoosadistic approaches to sex with animals. Beetz argues that animals might be traumatized even by a non-violent, sexual approach from a human;&lt;ref name="Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8"&gt;Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8.&lt;/ref&gt; however, Beetz also says that in some cases, non-abusive bestiality can be reciprocally pleasurable for both the human and non-human animal.&lt;ref name="Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8"/&gt;

An argument from human dignity is given by Wesley J. Smith, a senior fellow and [[Intelligent Design]] proponent at the [[Center for Science and Culture]] of the conservative Christian [[Discovery Institute]]: – "such behavior is profoundly degrading and utterly subversive to the crucial understanding that human beings are unique, special, and of the highest moral worth in the known universe—a concept known as '[[human exceptionalism]]' ... one of the reasons bestiality is condemned through law is that such degrading conduct unacceptably subverts standards of basic human dignity and is an affront to humankind's inestimable importance and intrinsic moral worth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyjsmith.com/blog/2005/08/bestiality-and-varied-attacks-on-human.html Wesleyjsmith.com] and [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/985pgwjh.asp Weeklystandard.com], 31 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary critiques of bestiality is that it is harmful to animals and necessarily abusive, because animals are unable to give or withhold consent.&lt;ref name=Regan63&gt;Regan, Tom. ''Animal Rights, Human Wrongs''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, pp. 63–4, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) has said that as animals do not have the same capacity for thinking as humans, they are unable to give full consent. The HSUS takes the position that all sexual activity between humans and animals is abusive, whether it involves physical injury or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ Sex Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20071214033934/http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ |date=14 December 2007 }}, NManimalControl.com&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1993 article, Dr. Frank Ascione stated that "bestiality may be considered abusive even in cases when physical harm to an animal does not occur." In a 1997 article, Piers Beirne, Professor of Criminology at the University of Southern Maine, points out that 'for genuine consent to sexual relations to be present...both participants must be conscious, fully informed and positive in their desires.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ |title=The First Strike Campaign: ANIMAL SEXUAL ABUSE FACT SHEET |website=NManimalControl.com |accessdate=13 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312010653/http://www.nmanimalcontrol.com/aco_fo/sex_abuse/ |archive-date=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2752/089279393787002105 |title=Children Who are Cruel to Animals: A Review of Research and Implications for Developmental Psychopathology |year=1993 |last1=Ascione |first1=Frank R. |journal=Anthrozoös: A Multidisciplinary Journal of the Interactions of People and Animals |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=226–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some defenders of bestiality argue that the issue of [[sexual consent]] is irrelevant because many legal human practices (such as [[semen collection]], [[Artificial insemination of livestock and pets|artificial insemination]], hunting, [[animal testing|laboratory testing]], and slaughtering animals for meat) do not involve the consent of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 February 2011 by Lucas Wachob |url=http://www.breezejmu.org/opinion/columnists/article_f08fbb0c-42ca-11e0-ab43-00127992bc8b.html |title=Column: In defense of chicken 'lovers' – The Breeze: Columnists |website=Breezejmu.org |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Cutteridge states the following regarding this argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Animal sexual autonomy is regularly violated for human financial gain through procedures such as [artificial insemination and slaughter]. Such procedures are probably more disturbing physically and psychologically than acts of zoophilia would be, yet the issue of consent on the part of the animal is never raised in the discussion of such procedures. To confine the 'right' of any animal strictly to acts of zoophilia is thus to make a law [against zoophilia] based not on reason but on moral prejudice, and to breach the constitutional rights of zoophiles to due process and equality before the law. [...] Laws which criminalize zoophilia based on societal abhorrence of such acts rather than any real harm caused by such acts are an unjust and unconstitutional infringement on individual liberty."&lt;ref name="interdis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cutteridgepaper.pdf |title=Inter-disciplinary.net |format=PDF |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722100122/http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cutteridgepaper.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hani Miletski|Miletski]] believes that "Animals are capable of sexual consent – and even initiation – in their own way."&lt;ref&gt;Miltski, 1999, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not an uncommon practice for dogs to attempt to copulate with ("hump") the legs of people of both genders.&lt;ref&gt;Cauldwell, 1948 &amp; 1968; Queen, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberger (1968) emphasizes that as far as cunnilingus is concerned, dogs require no training, and even Dekkers (1994) and Menninger (1951) admit that sometimes animals take the initiative and do so impulsively.&lt;ref name="Beetz 2002, section 5.2.8"/&gt; Those supporting zoophilic activity feel animals sometimes even seem to enjoy the sexual attention&lt;ref&gt;Blake, 1971, and Greenwood, 1963, both cited in Miletski, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; or voluntarily initiate sexual activity with humans.&lt;ref name="Dekkers, 1994"&gt;Dekkers, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals such as dogs can be willing participants in sexual activity with humans, and "seem to enjoy the attention provided by the sexual interaction with a human."&lt;ref name="interdis"/&gt; Animal owners normally know what their own pets like or do not like. Most people can tell if an animal does not like how it is being petted, because it will move away. An animal that is liking being petted pushes against the hand, and seems to enjoy it. To those defending bestiality this is seen as a way in which animals give consent, or the fact that a dog might wag its tail.&lt;ref&gt;(Einsenhaim, 1971, cited in Kathmandu, 2004)"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Preference utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] philosopher and [[Animal rights|animal liberation]] author [[Peter Singer]] argues that bestiality is not unethical so long as it involves no harm or cruelty to the animal&lt;ref name=SingerNerve&gt;Singer, Peter. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080616055314/http://www.nerve.com/Opinions/Singer/heavyPetting/main.asp Heavy Petting], ''Nerve'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[Harm principle]]''). In the article "Heavy Petting,"&lt;ref name="Singer01"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pablo Stafforini |url=http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/2001----.htm |title=Utilitarian.com |website=Utilitarian.com |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606173906/http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/2001----.htm |archivedate=6 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer argues that zoosexual activity need not be abusive, and that relationships could form which were mutually enjoyed. Singer and others have argued that people's dislike of bestiality is partly caused by irrational [[speciesism]] and [[anthropocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/isle/isq034 |title=Animal Liberation or Human Redemption: Racism and Speciesism in Toni Morrison's Beloved |year=2010 |last1=Ruetenik |first1=T. |journal=Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=317–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/cul.2010.0020 |first=Colleen Glenney |last=Boggs |date=Fall 2010 |title=American Bestiality: Sex, Animals, and the Construction of Subjectivity |journal=Cultural Critique |volume=76 |issue=76|pages=98–125 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cultural_critique/summary/v076/76.boggs.html |jstor=40925347|doi-broken-date=2018-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because interspecies sex occurs in nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070314-hybrids.html |title=Interspecies Sex: Evolution's Hidden Secret? |website=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because humans ''are'' animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/pwruab/cgi-bin/pwrofthepen/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/kerstin-grune1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Changing Perspectives of Bestiality: Breaking the Human-Animal Distinction to Violating Animal  Rights|website=Stanford.edu|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporters argue that zoosexual activity is not "unnatural" and is not intrinsically wrong.&lt;ref name="mroberts"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1328310 |title=The Unjustified Prohibition against Bestiality: Why the Laws in Opposition Can Find No Support under the Harm Principle |year=2009 |last1=Roberts |first1=Michael |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01639625.2010.538356 |title=Screwing the Pooch: Legitimizing Accounts in a Zoophilia On-line Community |year=2011 |last1=Maratea |first1=R.

Research has proven that non-human animals can and do have [[Animal co-opted sexual behavior|sex for non-reproductive purposes]] (and [[Animal sexual behaviour#Sex for pleasure|for pleasure]]).&lt;ref name="Poiani"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aldo Poiani|author2=A.

Some zoophiles claim that they are not abusive towards animals:&lt;ref name="ScientificAmerican" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In other recent surveys, the majority of zoophiles scoffed at the notion that they were abusive toward animals in any way—far from it, they said. Many even consider themselves to be animal welfare advocates in addition to zoophiles."&lt;ref name="ScientificAmerican" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mentions in the media==
Because of its controversial nature, different countries vary in the discussion of bestiality. Often sexual matters are the subject of legal or regulatory requirement. In 2005 the UK broadcasting regulator ([[OFCOM]]) updated its code stating that freedom of expression is at the heart of any democratic state. Adult audiences should be informed as to what they will be viewing or hearing, and the young, who cannot make a fully informed choice for themselves, should be protected. Hence a [[Watershed (television)|watershed]] and other precautions were set up for explicit sexual material, to protect young people. Zoophile activity and other sexual matters may be discussed, but only in an appropriate context and manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/ifi/codes/bcode/?a=87101 |title=OFCOM Broadcasting Code |website=Ofcom.org.uk |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPT was replaced after the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act in 1993, replaced with bodies designed to allow both more debate and increased consistency, and possession and supply of material that it is decided are objectionable was made a criminal offence.

Mention in the media is often comical in nature. References to bestiality are not uncommon in some media, especially adult [[cartoon]] series such as ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[South Park]]'', [[satire|satirical comedy]] such as ''[[Borat]]'', and films (especially shock [[exploitation film]]s), although a few broadcasters such as [[Howard Stern]] (who joked about bestiality dial-a-date on NBC) and [[Tom Binns]] (whose [[XFM London]] Breakfast Show resulted on one occasion in a live discussion about the ethics of zoophilic pornographic movies at peak child listening time) have been reprimanded by their stations for doing so.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In literature, American novelist [[Kurt Vonnegut]] refers to a photo of a woman attempting sexual intercourse with a Shetland Pony in ''[[The Sirens of Titan]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'', and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]''. [[Philip K. Dick]] also refers to a photo of a woman copulating with a Shetland Pony in ''[[Flow My Tears The Policeman Said]]''. [[John Irving]]'s novel ''[[The Cider House Rules]]'' repeatedly mentions a pornographic photograph depicting oral sex on a pony. In ''[[Clerks II]]'' Randal orders a [[donkey show]] as a going away present for his best friend Dante, in which it is referred to as "interspecies erotica" by the male performer.

[[Pu Songling]] refers to zoophilia in the ''[[Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio]]'' short story "[[The Fornicating Dog]]", which talks about sexual relations between a woman and her white dog.
