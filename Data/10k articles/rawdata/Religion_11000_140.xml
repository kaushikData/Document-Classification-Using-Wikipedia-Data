'''''Adam and Eve''''' is a pair of [[panel painting|oil-on-panel]] paintings by German Renaissance artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

Completed in 1507, the work followed a [[commons:File:Adam Eva, Durer, 1504.jpg|1504 copper engraving]] by Dürer on the same subject, one which offered Dürer the opportunity to depict the ideal human figure. Painted in Nuremberg soon after his return from Venice, the panels were influenced by Italian art. Dürer's observations on his second trip to Italy provided him with new approaches to portraying the human form. Here, he depicts [[Adam and Eve]] at human scale—the first full-scale nude subjects in German painting&lt;!--source: Russian, Spanish wikis--&gt;.

''Adam and Eve''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s first home was the [[Prague Castle]], the property of collector [[Rudolf II]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], armies plundered the castle and the panels came to be owned by [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]]. His daughter, [[Christina of Sweden|Christina]], gave the work to [[Philip IV of Spain]] in 1654. Later King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] ordered in 1777 that the painting be hidden in the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]. It arrived at its current home, Madrid's [[Museo del Prado]], in 1827, but was not publicly displayed until 1833.&lt;!--provenance source: Spanish wiki--&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Ahn was born to [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist]] parents{{efn|By 1918 Buddhism was the predominant religion in Korea. By 2010, according to a survey cited by ''[[The World Factbook]]'', 2013–14 edition, Christians accounted for 31.6% (Protestant 24%, Roman Catholic 7.6%) and Buddhists for 24.2% of the South Korean population.{{r|CIA}}}} on 13 January 1918 in the small, [[rural]] village of Myeongdeok-[[Ri (administrative division)|ri]] in the [[North Jeolla Province]] at a time when [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea was under Japanese rule]]. The family [[Human migration|migrated]] to [[Busan]], where Ahn grew up in the [[Haeundae District]], the city in which he would later found his church.{{r|issues141144}}{{rp|127}}{{r|emerging1992}}{{rp|339}}{{r|heresy1999}}{{rp|65}}{{r|heresy2000}}{{rp|489}}{{r|nrk2002}}

=== Conversion to Christianity ===
From 1937, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[World War II]], Ahn and his mother lived in [[Japan]] over a nine-year period. He returned to Korea in 1946, after the war, and began attending the local congregation of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] in [[Incheon]] in 1947.{{r|issues141144}}{{r|emerging1992}}{{r|heresy1999}}{{r|heresy2000}}{{r|nrk2002}} Ahn reported getting [[revelation]]s in 1953,{{r|CarfS}} and [[Renunciation|renounced]] his Buddhist faith and was [[Believer's baptism|credobaptised]] on 1948{{r|ikccah2012}}{{efn|Previously a baptismal date of 16 December 1948 performed by a [[Pastor]] Lee Myeong-deok in Incheon has been reported, but the source for this date and name is obscure, and no written record exists.{{r|issues141144}}{{rp|125}}{{r|emerging1992}}{{rp|338}}{{r|heresy1999}}{{r|heresy2000}}{{rp|494}}{{r|issue348}} The published references writes that with a 1948 baptism the ministry of Ahn was {{Circa}} 37 years (1948–1985),{{r|issues141144}}{{r|emerging1992}}{{r|heresy1999}}{{rp|75}}{{r|heresy2000}}{{r|history1999}} which has been used in argument for him fulfilling a [[Davidic dynasty in Bible prophecy|Davidic]] prophecy being the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus, the use of the honorific ''Christ Ansanghong'', and the assertion that he [[Entering heaven alive|ascended]] rather than died by the World Mission Society Church of God.{{r|david}} The investigation by The International Korean Christian Coalition against Heresy of the protocol from the Seventh-day Adventist Church stating Ahn was baptised on 9 October 1954 by a Pastor Gim Seo-gyeong showed, that while Pastor Gim could be confirmed, no Pastor Lee Myeong-deok was with the church in 1948.{{r|ikccah2012}}}} In 1956 Ahn proclaimed that "Within 10 years there will be a [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]]."{{r|issues141144}}{{rp|127}}{{r|emerging1992}}{{rp|339}}{{r|heresy2000}}{{rp|489}}{{r|2007cults}}{{rp|90}}{{r|amen12676-1948-88a}} On 5 April 1958 he married Hwang Wonsun (1923–2008),{{efn|{{lang-ko|[[wikt:황|황]] [[wikt:원|원]] [[wikt:순|순]] | links=no}}; {{transl|ko|''hwang-won-sun''}}{{r|BjS4Y}}}} with the marriage producing three children.{{r|interview with ahn kwang-sup}}{{r|grave2}}

=== Own church ===
Ahn grew critical to [[Seventh-day Adventist theology|teachings]] in the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], and the church [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] him in March 1962 over disputes about the [[Christian cross|cross]] as a [[religious symbol]].{{r|inch106doctrines}}{{r|issues141144}}{{rp|128}}{{r|heresy1999}}{{rp|65}}{{r|heresy2000}}{{rp|490}}{{r|nrk2002}}{{r|ikccah2012}}{{r|elijahand}}{{rp|30}} Twenty-three people followed Ahn and left the church, and two years later on 28 April 1964, Ahn established his church '''Witnesses of Jesus Church of God'''{{efn|{{Lang-ko|하나님의교회 예수증인회|links=no}}. The name "Church of God", mentioned several times in e.g. [[Paul the Apostle]]'s [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|First]] and [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]], and in his [[Epistle to the Galatians]],{{r|01GQg}} is a name used by numerous, mostly unrelated [[Christian denomination]]al bodies.{{r|Melton2005}} Ahn in ''Doctrine Manual of the Witnesses of Jesus Church of God'' (1972) cites [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] and [[First Epistle to Timothy]]{{r|jpZC1}} as the source for "Church of God", and several [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verses]] in [[Acts of the Apostles]] as the source for "Witnesses of Jesus".{{r|doctrinemanual}}{{rp|7–8}}}} in [[Busan]].{{r|inch106doctrines}}{{r|kcourt2005}}{{r|heresy1999}}{{r|nrk2002}}{{r|金洪喆1989}} Witnesses of Jesus Church of God expanded to 13 congregations in [[South Korea]] before Ahn's death in 1985.{{r|issue348}}{{r|mr141-144}}{{r|ZTrAB}}

=== Beliefs ===
Major [[dogma]]ta are outlined in ''Doctrine Manual of the Witnesses of Jesus Church of God'' (1972),{{r|doctrinemanual}} and detailed in the more than two [[dozen]] books Ahn wrote. His original publications as well as scans of his notes and extant [[sermon]]s have been made available online.{{r|ashpubs}} Ahn argued that the practice of the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic early church]] had been distorted and his [[Restorationism|restorational]] doctrines and practices included:{{r|inch106doctrines}}
# Women should wear [[Christian headcovering|headcovering]] while praying.
# [[Baptism]] is the first step towards [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]].
# The [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]] should be kept on [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|Saturdays]], not Sundays.
# [[Christmas]] should not be celebrated as Jesus' birthday because it is the anniversary of the [[Solar deity|sun god]].
# The [[Christian cross|cross]] is considered a form of [[idolatry]].
# The [[Passover (Christian holiday)|Passover]] and Festival of Unleavened Bread should be kept.
# Keeping the feasts in [[Book of Leviticus]] {{bibleref2|LEV|23|NIV|chapter 23}}: [[First Fruits]], [[Festival of Weeks]], [[Feast of Trumpets]], [[Day of Atonement]]; and [[Feast of Tabernacles]].

==== Eschatology ====
Ahn, who like most Christians{{r|EricksonHustad2001}} believed in the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus,{{r|doctrinemanual-secondcoming}} had predicted a Second Coming "within 10 years" in 1956.{{r|issues141144}}{{rp|127}}{{r|emerging1992}}{{rp|339}}{{r|heresy2000}}{{rp|489}}{{r|2007cults}}{{rp|90}}{{r|amen12676-1948-88a}} In the tradition of [[Seventh-day Adventist eschatology]], which had been suppressed by [[Kuniaki Koiso]] during his wartime rule of Korea,{{r|Kang1997}} Ahn further believed to be living in the [[end time]] and that the Second Coming was imminent. As Korean [[Protestant]]s earlier in the 20th century had perceived [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]] by identifying symbolically with the history of Israel,{{r|ParkPak2011}} Ahn through biblical [[exegesis]] in his book ''The Mystery of God and the Spring of the Water of Life'' (1980){{r|The Mystery of God and the Spring of the Water of Life}} interprets the [[Gospel of Matthew]] {{bibleref2|MT|24|NIV|chapter 24 verse 32-34}} to suggest that the world could come to an end in 1988, 40 years after the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|independence]] of the modern state of [[Israel]].{{r|amen12676-1948-88a}} Ahn's original ''The Mystery of God and the Spring of the Water of Life'' is made available [http://www.ncpcog.co.kr/rb/home/c/21/22/57 online]; World Mission Society Church of God in their later editions of the book have deleted information pertaining to the failed prediction.{{r|amen12676-1948-88a}} Ahn in his book ''The Bridegroom Was a Long Time in Coming, and They All Became Drowsy and Fell Asleep'' (1980){{r|The Bridegroom Was a Long Time in Coming, and They All Became Drowsy and Fell Asleep}} in a discussion based on [[Typology (theology)|scriptural typology]], presented his conclusion that the world would come to an end in 2012:
{{Quote box
| title = 
| quote = Since the day that the [[Ten Commandments]] was received, it took 168 days to build the [[tabernacle]] and to hold the ceremony, and as the fulfillment of this prophecy, Jesus also went into the heavenly Most Holy on the 10th day of the 7th month in 1844 which is the [[Day of Atonement]], and since then began to build the heavenly temple for 168 days namely 168 days until the ceremony. The [[prophecy]] is to be interpreted as 1 day to 1 year ([[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] {{bibleref2|Ezekiel|4:6|NIV|4:6}}; [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{bibleref2|NUM|14:34|NIV|14:34}}. Therefore, adding 168 years to 1844 when Jesus entered the heavenly Most Holy, [[2012 phenomenon|2012 becomes the last day]].

==== Mother ====
By 1978 a group of people centered around a female member, one Um Sooin{{efn|{{lang-ko|엄수인|links=no}}; {{transl|ko|''eom-su-in''}}{{r|uakfv}}}} (born 1941), within the Witnesses of Jesus Church of God, claimed through a chain of scriptural [[eisegesis]] that they published in writing, that Um variously was "the only [[Bride of Christ|bride]]", "the [[New Jerusalem|Heavenly Jerusalem]]", "the [[New Jerusalem]]" on earth, "the [[The Paraclete|comforter]] sent by God", and they asserted that she was "our [[Heavenly Mother|mother]] who has come down from Heaven", and that Ahn was [[Christ]].{{r|kchr130528}}{{r|enjerusalem}}{{r|kojerusalem}} Um and the group around her claiming she was the spiritual mother were expelled from the church,{{r|kcourt2005}}{{r|enjerusalem}}{{r|kojerusalem}} and Ahn dedicated a book entitled ''[http://ncpcog.co.kr/rb/home/b/0604/441 Problems with the New Jerusalem, the Bride and Women's Veils]'' (1980, reprinted 1983) to the controversy, in which he writes:

The Jerusalem in Heaven is Our Mother ... Um Sooin speaks as if she is out of her mind when she claims that the [[New Jerusalem]] is herself ... they assert that Um Sooin is our mother who has come down from Heaven. ... How extremely scandalous is this? With this type of misguided [[delusion]], she has become a [[false prophet]] and has attempted to gain power. ... The New Jerusalem which is written of in {{bibleref2|REV|21:1-4|NIV|Revelation 21:1-4}} ... is a spiritual building not a person. .... Nobody except someone who is not in their right state of mind can believe and follow after this. ... Because the interpretation of Um Sooin was made to match their claims, they have made these ridiculous interpretations. ...

Ahn concludes his rebuking of Um Sooin:
{{Quote box

| quote = There is never a time when the activity of [[Satan]] is cut off in the true Church. The [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]] has written as follows that the [[Devil]] will utilize women to cause confusion inside the Church:
"A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner."{{bibleref2c|1TIM|2:11-14|NIV|1 Timothy 2:11-14}}
In other words, whenever a woman makes assertions in the Church, the Church will fall under the deception of the Devil.

=== Death ===
Following a [[heart attack]] during lunch on 24 February 1985, Ahn had a [[stroke]] en route to hospital, and died the next day, 25 February 1985 in the Catholic [[Maryknoll]] Hospital{{efn|{{lang-ko|메리놀병원|links=no}}; Also romanizised ''Merinol Hospital'' after its pronunciation, {{transl|ko|''me-ri-nol-byeong-won''}}{{r|KfqTp}}}}{{r|PnYUn}} in [[Jung District, Busan]].{{r|doctorsnews}} Ahn Sahng-hong was 67 years old. He was survived by his wife and three children.{{r|inch106doctrines}}{{r|emerging1992}}{{rp|337}}{{r|heresy1999}}{{rp|65}}{{r|heresy2000}}{{rp|494}}{{r|nrk2002}}

Ahn was [[Burial|buried]] in a public [https://maps.google.com.au/maps?hl=en&amp;q=%EC%84%9D%EA%B3%84%EA%B3%B5%EC%9B%90&amp;ie=UTF-8 grave] located in Seokgye [[Cemetery]]{{efn|{{lang-ko|석계공원묘지|links=no}}; {{transl|ko|''seok-kkye-gong-won-myo-ji''}}{{r|9dsHw}}}}{{r|ikccah1572grave}} {{convert|30|km}} north of Busan. From the time of his burial in 1985, a single [[tombstone]] stood beside the grave, the [[epitaph]] reading: "The grave of the prophet [[Elijah]] Ahn Sahng-hong."{{efn|{{lang-ko|선지 엘리야 안상홍 지 묘|links=no}}}}{{r|grave}}{{r|grave85ex}} After the death of his wife Hwang Won-sun 23 years later on 4 September 2008, she was buried in the plot beside Ahn, and a new tombstone carrying both their names (as well as their children's on the back) replaced the 1985 stone, repeating the epitaph.{{r|grave2}}{{r|ikccah2023grave}}

== Legacy ==
The unexpected death of Ahn gave rise to a power struggle within Witnesses of Jesus Church of God:{{r|kcourt2005}}{{r|ncpcog-after-death}} some people in the church wanted to continue along the lines laid out by Ahn, others wanted to re-introduce the concept of a "spiritual mother" embodied in the then 41-year-old woman named [[Zahng Gil-jah]]{{efn|{{lang-ko|장길자|links=no}}; {{transl|ko|''jang-gil-ja''}}{{r|5CDJm}}}} (born 1943).{{r|kcourt2005}}{{r|nrk2002}}{{r|interview with ahn kwang-sup}}{{r|ikccah2023grave}} After an [[extraordinary general meeting]] in Witnesses of Jesus Church of God on 4 March 1985 failed to reconcile the opposing factions, a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] divided the church into two [[sect]]s{{r|kcourt2005}}{{r|inch106doctrines}}{{r|nrk2002}}

=== New Covenant Passover Church of God ===
One group of people in Witnesses of Jesus Church of God stayed on the premises in Busan. Among them were Ahn's wife and their three children. This sect is today known as New Covenant Passover Church of God. Ahn's son Ahn Kwang-sup{{efn|{{lang-ko|안광섭|links=no}}; {{transl|ko|''an-gwang-seop''}}{{r|etrmd}}}} (born 1954) is an elder in the church and continues to expound on his father's work.{{r|oqm59}} An outside observer visited the church and had this comment:

=== Witnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong Church of God ===
Another group of people in Witnesses of Jesus Church of God including the man Kim Joo-cheol{{efn|{{lang-ko|김주철|links=no}}; {{transl|ko|''gim-ju-cheol''}}{{r|mP8a9}}}} and the woman [[Zahng Gil-jah]] wanted to re-introduce the concept of a "spiritual mother", and on 22 March 1985 moved from Busan to [[Seoul]].{{r|kcourt2005}}{{r|inch106doctrines}}{{r|heresy1999}}{{r|nrk2002}} On a meeting in Seoul on 2 June 1985, they established a church called Witnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong Church of God. Two major new doctrines were codified{{r|amen12676-1948-88a}}{{r|ikccah2023}}
;*Ahn Sahng-hong should be regarded as Jesus Christ who had already come, should be titled ''Christ Ahn Sahng-hong'', and pursuant to a traditional [[Trinity|trinitarian]] view of Christian [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] Ahn was consequently also [[Holy Spirit|The Holy Spirit]], [[God the Father]], and thus [[God]].{{r|PXIZX}}
;*Zahng Gil-jah should be regarded as [[Heavenly Mother|God the Mother]], a female image of God,{{r|God Elohim}} be titled ''Heavenly Mother'', or simply ''Mother'', and together with Ahn Sahng-hong be regarded as God.{{r|God Elohim}}
A change in religious practice, as reflected in the change of name from "Witnesses of Jesus" to "Witnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong", was, that prayers were no longer conducted in the name of [[Jesus Christ]] but in the name of ''Christ Ahn Sahng-hong''.{{r|inch106doctrines}}

The [[Apotheosis|deification]] of Ahn Sahng-hong and Zahng Gil-jah has been "harshly criticized,"{{r|kcourt2005}} and has led to the church being officially [[Damnation|condemned]] by The National Council of Churches in Korea as an [[interdenominational]]ly combatted, [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]], [[Heresy|heretical]] [[cult]].{{r|kncc}}{{r|KOR43208.E}}

As a central argument to the claim that Ahn Sahng-hong should be the Second Coming of Jesus, and in turn an argument for his suggested promotion of Zahng Gil-jah to the Bride of the Lamb, is the proposition that he fulfilled a [[Davidic dynasty in Bible prophecy|Davidic]] prophecy by preaching 37 years from his baptism 16 December 1948 to his death on 25 February 1985,{{r|david}}{{r|952summarize}} a period which in reality was only 36 years, 2 months, and 9 days.{{r|36years}} The source for the baptismal date of 16 December 1948 performed by a [[Pastor]] Lee Myeong-deok in Incheon is however obscure, and no written record exists.{{r|issues141144}}{{rp|125}}{{r|emerging1992}}{{rp|338}}{{r|heresy1999}}{{r|heresy2000}}{{rp|494}}{{r|issue348}} In 2011 a protocol from the Seventh-day Adventist Church was discovered, stating Ahn was baptised when he was 36 years old on 9 October 1954 by a Pastor Gim Seo-gyeong. The investigation by The International Korean Christian Coalition against Heresy showed, that while Pastor Gim could be confirmed, no Pastor Lee Myeong-deok was with the church in 1948, reducing the length of the ministry of Ahn from 36 years to 30 years and 4 months.{{r|ikccah2012}}
;1988 failed doomsday prophecy
Witnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong Church of God announced that "1988 is the end of the world" citing [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleref2|MT|24|NIV|24:32-34}} as Ahn had done in his 1980 book ''The Mystery of God and the Spring of the Water of Life''.{{r|kcourt2005}}{{r|The Mystery of God and the Spring of the Water of Life}}{{r|wa1988end1}}{{r|wa1988end2}} A few thousand members of Witnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong Church of God gathered on a mountain in [[:ko:소정면|Sojeong-myeon]], [[Yeongi County]], [[South Chungcheong Province]] awaiting the coming of Christ Ahn Sahng-hong, preparing for the [[rapture]] and the [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] of [[144000 (number)|144,000]] souls. When Ahn [[Unfulfilled Christian religious predictions|failed to appear and nothing happened]] the church updated their apocalyptic forecast and scheduled it to the opening of the 1988 Olympics in Seoul later that year where the members gathered and preached the end of the world would come by the end of 1988 and that Ahn Sahng Hong would come again. WMSCOG later claimed it was a fulfillment of the preaching of Johna.{{r|inch106doctrines}}{{r|kcourt2005}}{{r|emerging1992}}{{rp|342}}{{r|heresy1999}}{{rp|77}}{{r|heresy2000}}{{rp|494}}{{r|nrk2002}}{{r|issues88-90}}{{r|renamed-cwm}}

Around 1997, Witnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong Church of God had established a non-profit organization titled the Church of God World Mission Society for the purpose of registering and managing the organization's assets.{{r|kcourt2005}}{{r|renamed-cwm}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6373">[[File:Thaddäus Anton Dereser.jpg|thumb|Thaddäus Anton Dereser]]

'''Anton Dereser''' (also known as '''Thaddaeus a Sancto Adamo, OCD''') (3 February 1757, [[Fahr]], [[Franconia]] &amp;ndash;15 or 16 June 1827,  [[Breslau]]) was a [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] professor of [[hermeneutics]] and [[Semitic languages|Oriental languages]].

Dereser was a Catholic representative of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and promoted a rationalistic interpretation of the Bible. He had a marked tendency to take independent positions and defy authority—both secular and ecclesiastical—which involved him in numerous controversies and nearly cost him his life during the [[French Revolution]].

As the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' noted of him in 1913, "Dereser's combative character got him in trouble everywhere, and, though believing himself a good Catholic, he was imbued with a rationalistic, anti-Roman spirit", which made him "imbued with the shallow Rationalism of his time" and therefore "explaining away everything supernatural in Scripture and religion". This made all his writings "tainted" in the eyes of the Church authorities, though only one was placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (see below) and that without the name of the author - testifying to the Church's appreciation of his talent, in spite of its dislike of his rationalism.

==Life==
His [[Profession (religious)|Profession]] was in [[Cologne]] on 18 October 1777. He was ordained in 1780 at [[Mainz]]. During his studies of Philosophy and Theology at [[Würzburg]] and [[Heidelberg]], where he graduated, he acquired such renown that contrary to the custom of his religious order he was allowed to accept a professorship in [[Hermeneutics]] and [[Semitic languages|Oriental Languages]], first at his own [[alma mater]], then at the [[University of Bonn|Academy (University from 1786) of Bonn]] (1783–1791).

In 1791 he was sent to [[Strasbourg]] where he was a professor of Exegetical Theology and also filled the posts of preacher and of [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] at the episcopal [[seminary]]. This embroiled him with the ongoing [[French Revolution]]. Dereser refused the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|Constitutional oath]], making the clergy subordinate to the French civil authorities - an act which marked him out as a counter-revolutionary priest. During the [[Reign of Terror]] he was imprisoned and sentenced to death, but the capital punishment was commuted into one of [[deportation]]. It is not quite clear whether this was put into execution; but it is certain that with the fall of [[Robespierre]] he regained his liberty and returned with shattered health to the convent in [[Heidelberg]] (1796).

In 1799 he became professor of Oriental Languages, Exegesis and Pastoral Theology in Heidelberg. The [[Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden|Margrave of Baden]] withholding his consent to Dereser's acceptance of the office of [[Coadjutor bishop|coadjutor]] to the [[Bishop of Strasbourg]], Dereser was transferred with the whole university to [[Freiburg]] (1807), but having given offence by a funeral sermon (1810) had to leave suddenly to [[Karlsruhe]] where he was a pastor, and then to [[Constance]].

Thence he went to [[Lucerne]] where from 1811 to 1814 he was Rector of the Episcopal Seminary, but was expelled on account of his [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] teaching, which involved explaining away everything supernatural in Scripture and religion. He turned, on invitation, to Breslau as [[Canon (priest)|canon]] and professor of Dogmatic Theology (1815). There he spent the rest of his life.

==Works==
*One of his works, ''Commentario biblica in . . . Tu es Petrus'' ([[Bonn]], 1789) was placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''.
*His principal work was the translation of the [[Old Testament]] from [[Hebrew]] to [[German language|German]], completing the work of [[Dominic von Brentano]] who had translated the [[New Testament]] and the [[Pentateuch]]. The German Bible translation of Brentano and Dereser  ([[Frankfurt]], 1815–1828, 16 vols.) was revised by [[Johann Martin Augustin Scholz]] (1828–1837, 17 vols.).
*Other works, chiefly Latin, included
**on the ''Necessity of the Knowledge of Oriental Languages for the Study of Scripture'' (Cologne, 1783);
**''[[Hermeneutics]] of the Old and New Testament'' (1784 and 1786);
**''Dissertations on the Destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]'' (1784);
** on ''[[Saint John the Baptist]]'' (1785);
** on ''The Power and Duties of the [[Pope]] according to [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]]'' (1787);
** on ''A number of books and portions of the [[Old Testament]] with translations (partly metrical) and annotations'';
** on the ''[[Temptation of Christ]]'' (1789);
** on ''His Divinity and on [[Pharisaism]]'' ([[Strasbourg]], 1791);
** on the ''Foundation of the [[University of Bonn]]'' (1786);&lt;ref&gt;In its present incarnation, the [[University of Bonn]] is considered to have been founded in 1818; Dereser's book referred to the 1786 upgrading of its predecessor, the Academy of Bonn&lt;/ref&gt;
** a ''German Breviary'' ([[Augsburg]], 1793, several times reprinted)
** a ''German [[Prayer in Christianity|Prayer Book]]'' ([[Rottenburg an der Laaber|Rottenburg]], 1808).
* Dereser also edited [[A. Frenzel]]'s ''Treatise on Matrimony'' ([[Breslau]], 1818), which argues against the doctrine that [[Catholic Marriage|marriages should be indissoluble]]; the author later retracted it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8985">'''''Ayadgar-i Zareran''''' (and other approximations{{sup|cf.{{nbsp}}}}&lt;ref name="BTA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AIr5" /&gt;{{sup|[[#JJM|&amp;#91;#&amp;#93;]]}} of ambiguous [[Book Pahlavi]] ''ʾyʾtkʾr y zryrn''), meaning "Memorial of Zarer", is a [[Pahlavi literature|Zoroastrian Middle Persian]] [[Heroic poetry|heroic poem]] that, in its surviving manuscript form, represents one of the earliest surviving examples of [[Iranian literature|Iranian epic poetry]].

The poem of about 346 lines is a tale of the death in battle of the mythical hero Zarer (&lt; [[Avestan language|Avestan]] Zairivairi), and of the revenge of his death. The figures and events of the poem's story are embellishments of mythological characters and events alluded to in the ''[[Gathas]]'',&lt;ref name="EIr" /&gt; which are a set of autobiographical hymns in the ''[[Avesta]]'' that are attributed to the prophet [[Zoroaster]].

==Composition==
Historically, Iranian epic poems such as this one were composed and sung by travelling minstrels, who in pre-Islamic times were a fixture of Iranian society.&lt;ref name="PWL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|title=The Parthian Gōsān and Iranian Minstrel Tradition|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|issue=1/2|year=1957|pages=10{{ndash}}45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although heroic tales such as the ''Memorial of Zarer'' were collected by Zoroastrian priests for the now-lost [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid-era]] ''Book of Kings'',&lt;ref name="EIr" /&gt; (the ''Khwaday-Namag'', a 5th/6th-century collection of heroic legends), other minstrel compositions were either never written down (and have thus been lost), or are only known of from later translations into Islamic-era languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[New Persian|Persian]]. While the Sassanid-era ''Book of Kings'' has also been lost, a copy of the ''Memorial of Zarer'' was preserved by Zoroastrian priests in [[Pahlavi literature|Zoroastrian Middle Persian]] (so-called "Pahlavi", an exclusively written late form of Middle Persian used only by Zoroastrian priests), and it is the only surviving specimen of Iranian epic poetry in that Middle Iranian language.&lt;ref name="EIr"&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|chapter=Ayādgār ī Zarērān|year=1987|pages=128-129|title=Encyclopedia Iranica|series=vol. 3|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ayadgar-i-zareran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving manuscripts of the ''Memorial of Zarer'' are part of (copies of) the ''MK'' Codex, the colophones of which date to 1322, but—like most other "Pahlavi" literature {{mdash}} represents a codification of earlier oral tradition. The language of the poem is significantly older than the 14th century, and even has [[Parthian language]] words, phrases and grammatical usages scattered through it.&lt;ref name="PWL"&gt;{{citation |last=Boyce|first=Mary|chapter=Parthian Writings and Literature|pages=1151-1165|title=The Seleucid, Parthian and Sassanian Periods|series=Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 3(2)|editor-last=Yarshatar|editor-first=Ehsan|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-24693-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript came to the attention of western scholarship following [[Wilhelm Geiger]]'s report of the ''MK'' collection in 1890. Following an analysis by [[Émile Benveniste]] in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Benveniste|first=Emilé|year=1932|pages=245{{ndash}}293|title=Le mémorial de Zarēr, poème pehlevi mazdéen|journal=Journal Asiatique}}&lt;/ref&gt; the poem is now generally considered to be a 5th or 6th-century ([[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid-era]]) adaptation of an earlier ([[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid-era]]) Parthian original.&lt;ref name="EIr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AIr5"&gt;{{citation|last=Utas|first=Bo|chapter=On the Composition of the Ayyātkār ī Zarēran|year=1975|pages=399{{ndash}}418|title=Acta Iranica 5|series=(=''Monumentum H.S. Nyberg'', II)|location=Tehran/Liège|publisher=Brill}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
The story of ''Memorial of Zarer'' plays in the time of the mythological [[Kayanian dynasty|Kayanid]] monarch Wishtasp (&lt; Avestan [[Vishtaspa]]), the patron of [[Zoroaster]]. The story opens with the arrival of messengers at the Wishtasp's court. The message is from the [[daeva|daew]]-worshipping king of the [[Aniran|Un-Iranian]]ian Khyonas (&lt; Av. Hyaona), [[Arjasp]] (&lt; Avestan Arjat.aspa), who demands that Wishtasp "abandon 'the pure Mazda-worshipping religion which he had received from [[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]]', and should become once more 'of the same religion'" as himself.&lt;ref name="BTA" /&gt; Arjasp threatens Wishtasp with a brutal battle if Wishtasp does not consent.

Zarer, who is Wishtap's brother and the command-in-chief of Wishtasp's army, pens a reply in which Arjasp's demands are rejected and a site for battle is selected. In preparation for battle, the army of the [[Iran (word)|Iran]]ians grows so large that the "noise of the caravan of the country of Iran went up to heavens and the noise of the moving swords went up to hell."  Wishtasp's chief-minister, Jamasp (&lt; Av. Jamaspa), whom the poem praises as infinitely wise and able to fortell the future, predicts that the Iranians will win the battle, but also that many will die in it, including many of Wishtasp's clan/family. As predicted, many of the king's clansmen are killed in the fight, among them Wishtasp's brother Zarer, who is slain by Bidarafsh/Widrafsh, the wicked sorcerer (the epithet is 'jadu', implying a practitioner of black magic) of Arjasp's court.

Zarer's 7-year old son, Bastwar (&lt; Av. Bastauuairi) goes to the battlefield to recover his father's body. Enraged and grieving, Bastwar wows to take revenge. Although initially forbidden to engage in battle due to his youth, Bastwar engages with the Khyaonas, killing many of them, and revenging his father by shooting an arrow through Widrafsh's heart.&lt;ref name="BTA" /&gt; Meanwhile, Bastwar's cousin [[Esfandyar|Spandyad]] (&lt; Av. Spentodata) has captured Arjasp, who is then mutilated and humiliated by being sent away on a donkey without a tail.

Bastwar is subsequently appointed his father's successor as commander-in-chief and given the hand of Wishtasp's daughter, Homai, in marriage.&lt;ref name="BTA" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Although quintessentially Zoroastrian (i.e. indigenous ethnic Iranian religious tradition), the epic compositions of the travelling minstrels continued to be retold (and further developed) even in Islamic Iran, and the figures/events of these stories were just as well-known to Muslim Iranians as they had been to their Zoroastrian ancestors. The 5th/6th-century ''Book of Kings'', now lost, and partly perhaps a still living oral tradition in north-eastern Iran,&lt;ref name="EIr" /&gt; served as the basis for a 10th-century rhymed-verse version of the ''Memorial of Zarer'' by [[Abu-Mansur Daqiqi]]. In turn, Daqiqi's poem was incorporated by [[Firdausi]] in his ''[[Shahnameh]]''.&lt;ref name="EIr" /&gt; In 2009, these adaptations of ''Memorial of Zarer'' became the basis of the stage play ''Yādegār-e Zarirān'' written by Qotb al-Din Sadeqi, and played by Mostafa Abdollahi, Kazem Hozhir-Azad, Esmayil Bakhtiyari and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamejamonline.ir/newstext.aspx?newsnum=100943698314 Jam-i Jam Online News, "Yadgar-i Zariran comes to the Scene" in Persian, accessed March, 2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523132908/http://www.jamejamonline.ir/newstext.aspx?newsnum=100943698314 |date=20110523132908 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Vajrayana}}
The '''''Cakrasaṃvara Tantra''''' ({{lang-sa|चक्रसंवर तन्त्र}}) or '''''Khorlo Déchok''''' ({{bo|t=འཁོར་ལོ་བདེ་མཆོག|w='khor lo bde mchog}}) is considered to be of the mother class of the [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]] in [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]].{{sfn|Buswell|2013}} It is also called the ''Discourse of Sri Heruka'' (''sriherukabhidhana'') and the ''Samvara Light'' (''Laghusamvara''). David B. Gray dates this tantra to the late eight or early ninth century.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;Gray, David B. The Cakrasamvara Tantra: Its History, Interpretation, and Practice in India and Tibet, Santa Clara University, Religion Compass 1/6 (2007): 695–710, http://vajrayana.faithweb.com/chakrasamvara-tantra%20its%20history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cakrasamvara Tantra is mostly dedicated to describing rituals and meditations which produce either mundane [[siddhi]]s (accomplishment) such as flight and the supramundane siddhi of awakening. These are achieved through [[deity yoga]] (visualizing oneself as the deity) and the use of [[mantras]].&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Deity and mandala==
[[File:BochumJahrhunderthalle ChakrasamvaraMandala 03.JPG| thumb | Cakrasaṃvara [[sand mandala]], [[Bochum]], 2011]]
The central deity of the mandala, [[Saṃvara]], is a form of [[Heruka]], one of the principal [[yidam]] or meditational deities of the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].{{sfn|Gray|Yarnell|2007}}

Saṃvara is typically depicted with a blue-coloured body, four faces, and twelve arms, and embracing his consort, the wisdom [[dakini]] [[Vajravārāhī]] in [[Yab-Yum]]. Other forms of the deity are also known with varying numbers of limbs.

Saṃvara and Vajravārāhī are not to be thought of as two different entities, as an ordinary husband and wife are two different people; in reality, their divine embrace is a metaphor for the union of great bliss and emptiness, which are one and the same essence.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In Western meditation texts his name is often translated to mean "Highest Bliss". Meditation on Cakrasaṃvara is an advanced practice transmitted by one's lama, and binds the mind of the meditator to enlightenment itself.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Influence of Saivism==
The Samvara texts adopted the [[Hindu pilgrimage sites|pitha]] list from the Saiva text ''Tantrasadbhava'', introducing a copying error where a deity was mistaken for a place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huber|first1=Toni|title=The holy land reborn : pilgrimage &amp; the Tibetan reinvention of Buddhist India|date=2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-35648-8|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catholicosate''' or '''catholicate''' designates a particular ecclesiastical primacy, headed by a primate titled as [[Catholicos]]. Such regional primacies exist within various branches of [[Eastern Christianity]], especially those of [[Oriental Orthodox]] tradition. The term ''catholicosate'' also designates the area of responsibility (territorial or otherwise) of a [[catholicos]].  The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Καθολικος, meaning "wholeness" and it was used to designate ecclesiastical primacy of some major metropolitan sees.

While a catholicos is sometimes considered to correspond to a [[bishop]] in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] traditions, a catholicate is typically a larger and more significant organizational division than a [[Diocese|bishopric]], [[archdiocese]] or [[episcopal see]]. Catholicates often have distinct cultural traditions established over many centuries.

Within the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] there are two catholicosates: the [[Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin]] in [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral|Etchmiadzin]], [[Armenia]], and the [[Holy See of Cilicia|Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia]] in [[Antelias]], [[Lebanon]]. In the 10th century, when lands inhabited by Armenians were devastated by [[Seljuks]], the Armenian church took refuge in [[Cilicia]]. In the 15th century, a new catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernprelacy.org/pages/arm-church.htm History of The Armenian Church] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20040812224331/http://www.westernprelacy.org/pages/arm-church.htm |date=2004-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some traditions favor the [[English language]] spelling "catholicate", others favor "catholicosate." There is a degree of inconsistency in this regard.  Others spellings, including "catholicossate", are seen as well.

[[Christian theology|Christians believe]] that Jesus is the mediator of the [[New Covenant]].&lt;ref&gt;Such as {{bibleverse||Hebrews|8:6}} etc. See also {{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Epistle to the Hebrews}}: "The central thought of the entire Epistle is the doctrine of the Person of Christ and His Divine mediatorial office....

'''Christian ethics''' is a branch of [[Christian theology]] that defines [[Virtue#Christian tradition|virtuous behavior]] and [[Christian views on sin|wrong behavior]] from a Christian perspective. [[Systematic theology|Systematic theological]] study of Christian ethics is called '''moral theology'''.

Christian virtues are often divided into four [[cardinal virtues]] and three [[theological virtues]]. Christian ethics includes questions regarding [[Christian views on poverty and wealth|how the rich should act toward the poor]], [[Gender roles in Christianity|how women are to be treated]], and the [[Christianity and violence|morality of war]]. Christian ethicists, like other ethicists, approach ethics from different frameworks and perspectives. The approach of [[virtue ethics]] has also become popular in recent decades, largely due to the work of [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Stanley Hauerwas]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/539377/A_Brief_Look_at_MacIntyres_Virtue_Ethics_and_Theological_Application {{dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[curriculum]] for seminary [[Formation in the Catholic Church|formation]] of Catholic [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priests]] commonly includes multiple, required courses in [[Catholic moral theology]].  Required courses in moral theology or ethics are comparatively less common in [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[seminary|seminaries]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

=== Sources ===
In the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] tradition, Christian theology (and thus Christian ethics) are informed by four distinguishable sources known as the [[Wesleyan Quadrilateral]]. The four sources are [[Bible|scripture]], [[Christian tradition|tradition]], reason, and Christian experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/glossary-wesleyan-quadrilateral-the Wesleyan Quadrilateral, the] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032220/http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/glossary-wesleyan-quadrilateral-the |date=2 February 2017 }} - A Dictionary for United Methodists, Alan K. Waltz, Copyright 1991, Abingdon Press. Revised access date: 13 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[D. Stephen Long]], [[Jewish ethics]] and the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life of Jesus]] figure prominently in Christian ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|2010|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but "The Bible is the universal and fundamental source of specifically ''Christian'' ethics",&lt;ref name="The Westminster Press"&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|Macquarrie|1986|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long also claims "Christian ethics finds its source in diverse means, but it primarily emerges from the biblical narrative and especially the call of Abraham and Sarah and subsequent creation of the Jewish people".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|2010|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Childress and Macquarrie state that "Many Christian ethicists have claimed that Jesus Christ is the center of the biblical message in its entirety and the key to scripture".{{Relevance inline|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|Macquarrie|1986|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian ethicists "prefer a more [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] rendering of the message of scripture".{{Relevance inline|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Some modern Christians "understand '[[Liberation theology|liberation]]' or deliverance from oppression to be the message of scripture".{{Relevance inline|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Christians today "do not feel compelled to observe all [[613 commandments]]" in the Torah,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|2010|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Ten Commandments#Christianity|Ten Commandments]] often figure prominently in Christian ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|2010|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The [[Prophet]]s ground their appeals for right conduct in God's demand for [[righteousness]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|Macquarrie|1986|page= 434}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, "It is not... true to say that for the OT writers righteousness is ''defined'' by what God does; i.e., an act is not made righteous by the fact that God does it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|Macquarrie|1986|pages=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also noted as ethical guidelines adhered to by Old Testament figures is "maintenance of the ''family''", "safeguarding of the family ''property''", and "maintenance of the community".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|Macquarrie|1986|pages= 435–436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Testament ===
{{See also|Ethics in the Bible}}
Much of Christian ethics derives from Biblical scripture and Christians have always considered the Bible profitable to teach, reprove, correct, and train in righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;''Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'': "There is no 'Christian ethics' that would deny the authority of the Bible, for apart from scripture the Christian church has no enduring identity". {{harvnb|Childress|Macquarrie|1986|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'': Christian churches have always considered it a part of their calling to teach, reprove, correct, and train in righteousness, and they have always considered the Bible 'profitable' for that task. With virtually one voice the churches have declared that the Bible is an authority for moral discernment and judgment. And Christian ethicists—at least those who consider their work part of the common life of the Christian community—have shared this affirmation.{{harvnb|Childress|Macquarrie|1986|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Testament]] generally asserts that all [[morality]] flows from the [[Great Commandment]], to love God with all one's heart, mind, strength, and soul, and to love one's neighbour as oneself. In this, [[Jesus]] was reaffirming a teachings of {{bibleverse||Deut|6:4-9}} and {{bibleverse||Lev|19:18}}. Christ united these commands together and proposed himself as a model of the love required in {{bibleverse||John|13:12}}, known also as [[The New Commandment]].

Paul is also the source of the phrase "[[Law of Christ]]", though its meaning and the relationship of [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism]] are still disputed. The Pauline writings are also the major source of the [[New Testament household code]].

The [[Council of Jerusalem]], as reported in Acts 15, may have been held in Jerusalem in about 50 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt;. Its decree, known as the ''Apostolic Decree'', was held as generally binding for several centuries and is still observed today by the [[Greek Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html commentary on canon II of Gangra] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220220146/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html |date=20 December 2016 }} notes: "We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in his work [[Contra Faustum]], where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} But still, as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]] (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Christianity ===
{{Off topic|date=March 2016}}
Christian ethics developed during [[Early Christianity]] as Christianity arose in the Holy Land and other [[early centers of Christianity]] while [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|Christianity emerged from Second Temple Judaism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Consequently, early Christian ethics included [[Render unto Caesar...|discussions of how believers should relate to Roman authority and to the empire]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The [[Church Fathers]] had little occasion to treat moral questions from a purely philosophical standpoint and independently of divine revelation, but in the explanation of Christian doctrine their discussions naturally led to philosophical investigations.{{Relevance inline|date=March 2016}}

Writers, such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], [[Ambrose]], [[Jerome]], and [[Augustine of Hippo]] all wrote on ethics from a distinctly Christian point of view. They made use of philosophical and ethical principles laid down by their [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] forebears and the intersection of Greek and Jewish thought known as [[Hellenistic Judaism]].

Under the [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine I]] (312–337), Christianity became a legal religion. With Christianity now in power, ethical concerns broadened and included discussions of the proper role of the state.

Augustine in particular made use of the ethical principles of [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Hellenistic Judaism]]. He proceeded to develop thoroughly along philosophical lines and to establish firmly most of the truths of Christian morality. The [[eternal law]] (''lex aeterna''), the original [[Typology (theology)|type]] and source of all temporal laws, the [[natural law]], conscience, the ultimate end of man, the [[cardinal virtues]], [[sin]], [[marriage]], etc. were treated by him in the clearest and most penetrating manner. [[Augustine]] identified a movement in Scripture "toward the '[[City of God (book)|City of God]]', from which Christian ethics emerges", as illustrated in chapters 11 and 12 of the book of Genesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|2010|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, Augustine adapted the philosophy of [[Plato]] to Christian principles. His synthesis is called Augustinianism (alternatively, Augustinism). He presents hardly a single portion of ethics to us but what he does present is enriched with his keen philosophical commentaries. Later writers followed in his footsteps.

=== Scholasticism and Thomism ===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2011}}
{{Main|Scholasticism|Thomism}}

A sharper line of separation between philosophy and theology, and in particular between ethics and moral theology, is first met within the works of the great Schoolmen of the Middle Ages, especially of [[Albertus Magnus]] (1193–1280), [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), [[Bonaventure]] (1221–1274), and [[Duns Scotus]] (1274–1308). Philosophy and, by means of it, theology reaped abundant fruit from the works of Aristotle, which had until then been a sealed treasure to Western civilization, and had first been elucidated by the detailed and profound commentaries of Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas and pressed into the service of Christian philosophy.{{Relevance inline|date=March 2016}}

In his ''Summa Theologiae'', Thomas locates ethics within the context of theology. For example, he discusses the ethics of buying and selling and concludes that although it may be legal (according to human law) to sell an object for more that it is worth, Divine law "leaves nothing unpunished that is contrary to virtue."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas. Summa Theologica, "Of Cheating, Which Is Committed in Buying and Selling." Translated by The Fathers of the English Dominican Province. pp. 3 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON301-2.1.2-1st.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127183941/http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON301-2.1.2-1st.pdf |date=27 November 2012 }} Retrieved 19 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The question of ''beatitudo'', perfect happiness in the possession of God, is posited as the goal of human life.  Thomas also argues that the human being by reflection on human nature's inclinations discovers a law, that is the natural law, which is "man's participation in the divine law."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Thomas Aquinas]] |contribution=First Part of the Second Part (Prima Secundæ Partis) |title=[[Summa Theologica]] |edition=second and revised |year=1920 |others=English Translation by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province |contribution-url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2.htm |publisher=Kevin Knight at NewAdvent.org (2008)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the word love can be imprecise, so [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined "love" for the benefit of the Christian believer as "to will the good of another."&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2026.htm#article4 |title=St. Thomas Aquinas, STh I-II, 26, 4, corp. art |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern Christian ethics ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
After a couple centuries of stagnation, in the sixteenth century ethical questions are again made the subject of careful investigation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Writers include the [[Francisco de Vitoria]], [[Dominicus Soto]], [[Luis de Molina]], [[Francisco Suarez]], [[Leonardus Lessius]], [[Juan de Lugo]], [[Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz]], and [[Alphonsus Liguori]]. Since the sixteenth century, special chairs of ethics (moral philosophy) have been funded in many Catholic universities.

Among topics they discussed was the ethics of action in case of doubt, leading to the doctrine of [[probabilism]].

With the rejection of the doctrine of [[papal infallibility]] and the [[Magisterium|Roman Magisterium]] as the absolute religious authority, each individual, at least in principle, became the arbiter in matters pertaining to faith and morals.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The Reformers held fast to ''[[Sola Scriptura]]'' and many endeavored to construct an [[ethical system]] directly from the scriptures.

Lutheran [[Philipp Melanchthon]], in his "''Elementa philosophiae moralis''", still clung to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] strongly rejected by [[Martin Luther]], as did [[Hugo Grotius]] in ''[[De jure belli et pacis]]''. But [[Richard Cumberland (philosopher)|Richard Cumberland]] and his follower [[Samuel Pufendorf]] assumed, with [[Descartes]], that the ultimate ground for every distinction between good and evil lay in the free determination of God's will, an [[antinomian]] view which renders the philosophical treatment of ethics fundamentally impossible.

In the 20th century some Christian philosophers, notably [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], questioned the value of ethical reasoning in [[moral philosophy]]. In this school of thought, ethics, with its focus on distinguishing right from wrong, tends to produce behavior that is simply not wrong, whereas the Christian life should instead be marked by the highest form of right. Rather than ethical reasoning, they stress the importance of meditation on, and relationship with, God.  Other important Protestant Christian ethicists include [[H. Richard Niebuhr]], [[John Howard Yoder]], [[Glen Stassen]], and [[Stanley Hauerwas]].

[[Charles Sheldon]]'s 1896 book, ''[[In His Steps]]''  was subtitled "What Would Jesus Do?"&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon, C. (1896). [http://www.jr-miller.com/other/sheldon/in-his-steps.html ''In His Steps''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107084725/http://www.jr-miller.com/other/sheldon/in-his-steps.html |date=7 November 2012 }}. First published by the ''Chicago Advance'' in serial form.&lt;/ref&gt; and posed the question in the form of a novel. In a popular movement of the 1990s, many used the phrase "[[What would Jesus do?]]" (abbreviated WWJD) as a personal [[motto]].{{Relevance inline|date=March 2016}}{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The question was a reminder of their belief in a [[moral imperative]] to act in a manner that would demonstrate the [[Love of Christ|Love of Jesus]] through the actions of the adherents.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Virtues and principles ==

The seven Christian virtues are from two sets of virtues. The four [[cardinal virtues]] are [[Prudence]], [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]], [[Temperance (virtue)|Restraint (or Temperance)]], and [[Cardinal virtues|Courage (or Fortitude)]]. The cardinal virtues are so called because they are regarded as the basic virtues required for a virtuous life. The three [[theological virtues]], are [[Faith in Christianity|Faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]], and [[Charity (virtue)|Love (or Charity)]].

* [[Prudence]]: also described as wisdom, the ability to judge between actions with regard to appropriate actions at a given time
* [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]]: also considered as fairness, the most extensive and most important virtue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theplatonist.com/cardinal_virtues.htm |title=Cardinal Virtues of Plato, Augustine and Confucius |work=''theplatonist.com'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074259/http://www.theplatonist.com/cardinal_virtues.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]: also known as restraint, the practice of self-control, abstention, and moderation tempering the [[appetition]]
* [[Courage]]: also termed fortitude, forebearance, strength, endurance, and the ability to confront fear, uncertainty, and intimidation
* [[Faith in Christianity|Faith]]: belief in God, and in the truth of His [[revelation]] as well as obedience to Him (cf. [[Letter to the Romans|Rom]] 1:5:16:26)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The New Catholic Encyclopedia |chapter=Faith |last=Pickar |first=C. H. |page=792 |location=Washington D.C. |origyear=1967 |year=1981 |volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] n. 2087&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]]: expectation of and desire of receiving; refraining from despair and capability of not giving up. The belief that God will be eternally present in every human's life and never giving up on His love.
* [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]]: a supernatural virtue that helps us love God and our neighbors, the same way as we love ourselves.

=== Abortion ===
{{Main|Christianity and abortion}}
Christian views on abortion has a complex history as there is no explicit prohibition of [[abortion]] in either the Old Testament or New Testament books of the [[Christian Bible]].

The [[Catholic Church and abortion|Roman Catholic Church and teaches that abortion]] that "human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7Z.HTM#-2C6 Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2270] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008122958/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7Z.HTM#-2C6 |date=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, it opposes procedures whose purpose is to destroy an embryo or fetus for whatever motive (even before implantation), but admits acts, such as chemotherapy or hysterectomy of a pregnant woman who has cervical cancer, which indirectly results in the death of the fetus, is morally acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hpGMsOM27FgC&amp;pg=PA112 David F. Kelly, ''Contemporary Catholic Health Care Ethics''] (Georgetown University Press 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-58901-030-7}}), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first century, the Church has affirmed that every procured abortion is a moral evil, a teaching that the Catechism of the Catholic Church declares "has not changed and remains unchangeable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7Z.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2271] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114072804/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7Z.HTM |date=14 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the twentieth century [[Protestant]] views on abortion have varied considerably, with Protestants to be found in both the "anti-abortion" and "abortion-rights" camps.&lt;ref name="McGrathMarks2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGrath |first1=Alister E. |last2=Marks |first2=Darren C. |title=The Blackwell companion to Protestantism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7IFosfcrz0cC&amp;pg=PA294 |accessdate=5 January 2012 |year=2004 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-631-23278-0 |page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Protestants tend to be anti-abortion whereas "mainline" Protestants lean towards an abortion-rights stance.

Although scripture is mostly silent on [[abortion]], various elements of scripture inform Christian ethical views on this topic, including Genesis 4:1; Job 31:15; Isaiah 44:24, 49:1, 5; and Jeremiah 1:5, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|Macquarrie|1986 || page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alcohol ===
{{Main|Christian views on alcohol}}
Current views on alcohol in Christianity can be divided into moderationism, abstentionism, and prohibitionism. Abstentionists and prohibitionists are sometimes lumped together as "[[Teetotalism|teetotalers]]", sharing some similar arguments. However, prohibitionists abstain from alcohol as a matter of law (that is, they believe God requires abstinence in all ordinary circumstances), while abstentionists abstain as a matter of prudence (that is, they believe total abstinence is the wisest and most loving way to live in the present circumstances).&lt;ref name="Gentry"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Kenneth Gentry]] |title=God Gave Wine |publisher=Oakdown |year=2001 |isbn=0-9700326-6-8 |pages=3ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians, including [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] , Baptists and [[Methodism|Methodists]], today believe one ought to abstain from alcohol. Fifty-two percent of [[Evangelicals|Evangelical]] leaders around the world say drinking alcohol is incompatible with being a good Evangelical.&lt;ref name="Global-Survey-Evangelical-Protestant-Leaders"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/06/22/global-survey-of-evangelical-protestant-leaders/ |title=Global Survey of Evangelical Protestant Leaders |publisher=[[Pew Forum]] |year=2011 |accessdate=31 October 2013 |quote=[E]vangelical leaders are divided over the consumption of alcohol. About four-in-ten (42%) say it is compatible with being a good evangelical, while 52% say it is incompatible. Leaders from sub-Saharan Africa are especially likely to oppose alcohol use; 78% of them say it is incompatible with being a good evangelical, as do 78% of evangelical leaders who live in Muslim-majority countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelicals in Asia, Africa, and also in [[Muslim-majority countries]] are decidedly against drinking.

=== Divorce ===
{{Main|Christian views on divorce}}

[[Christian views on divorce]] are informed by verses in Matthew, Mark, Deuteronomy, and others&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|Macquarrie|1986|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political developments much later. In the [[synoptic Gospels]], Jesus emphasized the permanence of [[marriage]], but also its integrity. In the book of Matthew Jesus says "Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{bibleref2|Matthew|5:31-32}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|19:3-9}}, {{bibleref2|Mark|10:2-12}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|16:18}}, see also [[Expounding of the Law#Divorce]]&lt;/ref&gt; When Jesus discusses marriage, he points out that a certain talent is needed to live together with another human being. Not having assets of their own, women needed to be protected from the risk of their husbands' putting them on the street at whim. In those times marriage was an economic matter.&lt;ref name=Chadwick&gt;Henry Chadwick, The Early Church, {{ISBN|978-0140231991}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman and her children could easily be rejected. Restriction of divorce was based on the necessity of protecting the woman and her position in society, not necessarily in a religious context, but an economic context.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Hill, What Has Christianity Ever Done for Us?: How It Shaped the Modern World 978-0830833283&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] concurred but added an [[Pauline privilege|exception for abandonment by an unbelieving spouse]].

The Catholic Church prohibits divorce, but permits [[annulment]] (a finding that the marriage was never valid) under a narrow set of circumstances. The Eastern Orthodox Church permits divorce and remarriage in church in certain circumstances.&lt;ref name="ware"&gt;See Timothy (now Archbishop Kalistos) Ware, [http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/history_timothy_ware_2.htm#n5 ''The Orthodox Church''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717012001/http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/history_timothy_ware_2.htm#n5 |date=17 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Protestant]] churches discourage divorce except as a last resort, but do not actually prohibit it through church doctrine.

=== Sexual morality and celibacy ===
{{See also|Celibacy|Catholic teachings on sexual morality}}

Modern Christian sexual morality rejects [[Thou shalt not commit adultery#New Testament|adultery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|Macquarrie|1986|page= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Extramarital sex#Christianity|extramarital sex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|1Corinthians|6:9-10:}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[prostitution]],&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM 2355] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724064758/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM |date=24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rape]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM 2356] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724064758/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM |date=24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian views on the moral benefits of celibate and marital lifestyles has varied over time.

In his early writings, [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] described marriage as a [[Socialization|social obligation]] that has the potential of distracting from Christ. Sex, in turn, is not sinful but natural, and sex within marriage is both proper and necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Will Deming, ''Paul on marriage and celibacy: the hellenistic background of 1 Corinthians 7.'' [[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.]] 2003; 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; In his later writings, Paul made parallels between the relations between spouses and God's relationship with the church.&lt;ref&gt;"Husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church. Husbands should love their wives as their own bodies" {{bibleref|Ephesians |5:25-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul encouraged both celibate and marital lifestyles.&lt;ref name=Chadwick /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|1Corinthians|7:1-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Jesus made reference to some that have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|19:12}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no commandment in the New Testament that Jesus' disciples have to live in celibacy.&lt;ref name=Chadwick /&gt; The general view on sexuality among the early Jewish Christians was quite positive.&lt;ref name=GeelsRoos&gt;Geels, Antoon &amp; Roos, Lena. Sexuality in world's religions. University press, Lund, Sweden 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons.&lt;ref name="Chadwick" /&gt;

Today, the [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|Roman Catholic Church teachings]] on celibacy uphold it for monastics and priests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761565340/Celibacy.html Celibacy]. Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2009. [https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQgBdNN?url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761565340/Celibacy.html Archived] 31 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestantism has rejected the celibate (unmarried) life for preachers since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Many evangelicals prefer the term "abstinence" to "celibacy." Assuming everyone will marry, they focus their discussion on refraining from premarital sex and focusing on the joys of a future marriage. But some evangelicals, particularly older singles, desire a positive message of celibacy that moves beyond the "wait until marriage" message of abstinence campaigns. They seek a new understanding of celibacy that is focused on God rather than a future marriage or a lifelong vow to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Colon, Christine, and Bonnie Field. Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church. Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homosexuality ===
{{Main|Christianity and homosexuality}}
Within Christianity there are a variety of views on the issues of [[sexual orientation]] and [[homosexuality]]. The many [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] vary in their position, from condemning homosexual acts as [[Christian views on sin|sinful]], through being divided on the issue, to seeing it as morally acceptable. Even within a denomination, individuals and groups may hold different views. Further, not all members of a denomination necessarily support their church's views on homosexuality. In the Bible, procreative marriage is presented as "the norm"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|Macquarrie|1986|page=580}}&lt;/ref&gt; and homosexuality is discussed in the New Testament,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Childress|Macquarrie|1986|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries whether or not the Bible condemns homosexuality, and whether the various passages apply today, have become contentious topics.

=== Slavery ===
{{Main|Christian views on slavery}}

In modern times, Christian organizations reject any permissibility of slavery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mennoniteusa.org/resource/statement-against-human-trafficking-modern-day-slavery/ |title=Mennonite Church USA |quote="Preamble: To join with other Christian denominations in a united voice against the evil of human trafficking, we present this statement of our opposition to all forms of human slavery." |accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalfreedomnetwork.org/popefrancis2014/ |title=Pope Francis |quote="Inspired by our confessions of faith, today we are gathered for an historic initiative and concrete action: to declare that we will work together to eradicate the terrible scourge of modern slavery in all its forms." |accessdate=11 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216000542/http://www.globalfreedomnetwork.org/popefrancis2014/ |archive-date=16 February 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalfreedomnetwork.org/archbishopcanterbury2014/ |title=Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury |quote="At a time when faiths are seen wrongly as a cause of conflict is a sign of real hope that today global faith leaders have together committed themselves publicly to the battle to end modern slavery." |accessdate=11 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216000409/http://www.globalfreedomnetwork.org/archbishopcanterbury2014/ |archive-date=16 February 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/899/resolution-on-racial-reconciliation-on-the-150th-anniversary-of-the-southern-baptist-convention |title=Southern Baptist Convention |quote="...Be it further resolved, that we lament and repudiate historic acts of evil such as slavery from which we continue to reap a bitter harvest..." |accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Christian views on slavery did vary both historically. In the eighteenth and nineteenth century debates in the UK and the US, passages in the Bible were used by both pro-slavery advocates and abolitionists to support their respective views.

=== Violence ===
{{Main|Christianity and violence}}
[[File:Blessed are the Peacemakers.gif|thumb|''Blessed are the Peacemakers'' (1917) by [[George Bellows]]]]
[[Christian pacifism]] is the position that any form of [[violence]] is incompatible with the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith. Christian [[pacifists]] state that [[Jesus]] himself was a pacifist who taught and practiced [[pacifism]], and that his followers must do likewise. Notable Christian pacifists include [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Leo Tolstoy]],&lt;ref&gt;Colm McKeogh, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QTEfxGLi0O4C Tolstoy's Pacifism]'', Cambria Press, 2009, {{ISBN|1-60497-634-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ammon Hennacy]].

Jesus opposed use of violence in his statement that "[[live by the sword, die by the sword|all who will take up the sword, will die by the sword]]", which suggested that those who perpetrate violence will themselves face violence. Historian [[Roland Bainton]] described the [[Early Christianity|early church]] as pacifist – a period that ended with the accession of Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Bainton, quoted in Robin Gill, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zk97GUVa2p0C&amp;pg=PA194 A Textbook of Christian Ethics]'', 3rd ed, Continuum, 2006, {{ISBN|0-567-03112-8}}, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first few centuries of Christianity, many Christians refused to engage in military combat. In fact, there were a number of famous examples of soldiers who became Christians and refused to engage in combat afterward. They were subsequently executed for their refusal to fight.&lt;ref&gt;"No known Christian author from the first centuries approved of Christian participation in battle; citations advocating pacifism are found in → Tertullian, → Origen, Lactantius, and others, and in the testimonies of the martyrs Maximilian and Marcellus, who were executed for refusing to serve in the Roman army. Grounds for opposition to military service included fear of idolatry and the oath of loyalty to Caesar, as well as the basic objection to shedding blood on the battlefield.", Fahlbusch, E., &amp; Bromiley, G. W. (2005). Vol. 4: The encyclopedia of Christianity (2). Grand Rapids, Mich.; Leiden, Netherlands: Wm. B. Eerdmans; Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; The commitment to pacifism and rejection of military service is attributed by Allman and Allman to two principles: "(1) the use of force (violence) was seen as antithetical to Jesus' teachings and service in the Roman military required worship of the emperor as a god which was a form of idolatry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Would Jesus Kill?: War, Peace, and the Christian Tradition |first1=Mark |last1=Allman |first2=Mark J. |last2=Allman |publisher=Saint Mary's Press |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[conscientious objector]] in the modern sense was a [[Quaker]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;''The New conscientious objection: from sacred to secular resistance'' Charles C. Moskos, John Whiteclay Chambers – 1993 "The first conscientious objector in the modern sense appeared in 1815. Like all other objectors from then until the 1880s, he was a Quaker.4 The government suggested exempting the pacifist Quakers, but the Storting, the Norwegian "&lt;/ref&gt; The Quakers had originally served in Cromwell's [[New Model Army]] but from the 1800s increasingly became pacifists. A number of Christian denominations have taken pacifist positions institutionally, including the [[Quaker]]s and [[Mennonite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Speicher, Sara and Durnbaugh, Donald F. (2003), Ecumenical Dictionary: [http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/who/dictionary-article8.html ''Historic Peace Churches''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231831/http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/who/dictionary-article8.html |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacifist and violence-resisting traditions have continued into contemporary times.&lt;ref&gt;"Members of several small Christian sects who try to literally follow the precepts of Jesus Christ have refused to participate in military service in many nations and have been willing to suffer the criminal or civil penalties that followed."''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 2004 CD Rom Edition – Pacifism.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0141/_INDEX.HTM Evangelium Vitae]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.incommunion.org/2008/02/24/orthodoxy-and-capital-punishment |title=Orthodoxy and Capital Punishment |work=Incommunion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] adapted the nonviolent ideas of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] to a [[Progressive National Baptist Convention|Baptist]] theology and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=King, Jr. |first=Martin Luther |author2=Clayborne Carson |author3=Peter Holloran |author4=Ralph Luker |author5=Penny A. Russell |title=The papers of Martin Luther King, Jr. |publisher=University of California Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-520-07950-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wealth and Poverty ===
{{Main|Christian views on poverty and wealth}}

There are a variety of Christian views on poverty and wealth. At one end of the spectrum is a view which casts wealth and materialism as an evil to be avoided and even combatted.  At the other end is a view which casts prosperity and well-being as a blessing from God.  Some Christians argue that a proper understanding of Christian teachings on wealth and poverty needs to take a larger view where the accumulation of wealth is not the central focus of one's life but rather a resource to foster the "good life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Church and Society: Orthodox Christian Perspectives, Past Experiences, and Modern Challenges |first=George P. |last=Liacopulos |publisher=Somerset Hall Press |year=2007 |page=88 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xxY3gfmzdwwC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Christianity+attitudes+money+wealth#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-9774610-5-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[David W. Miller]] has constructed a three-part rubric which presents three prevalent attitudes among Protestants towards wealth.  According to this rubric, Protestants have variously viewed wealth as: (1) an offense to the Christian faith (2) an obstacle to faith and (3) the outcome of faith.&lt;ref name=Miller2007&gt;Miller, David W. "Wealth Creation as Integrated with Faith: A Protestant Reflection" Muslim, Christian, and Jewish Views on the Creation of Wealth 23–24 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Americans|American]] [[theologian]] [[John B. Cobb]] has argued that the "economism that rules the West and through it much of the East" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that "man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)". He asserts that it is obvious that "Western society is organized in the service of wealth" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West.&lt;ref name="Cobb, Jr"&gt;{{cite web |title=Eastern View of Economics |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3607 |first=John B. |last=Cobb, Jr. |accessdate=10 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906075839/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3607 |archivedate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{Synthesis|section|date=March 2016}}
[[Simon Blackburn]] states that the "[[Bible]] can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women".&lt;ref name="Blackburn 2001 12"&gt;{{harvnb|Blackburn|2001|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth S. Anderson]], a Professor of Philosophy and Women's Studies at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]], states that "the Bible contains both good and evil teachings", and it is "morally inconsistent".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|2007|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; She concludes that, "Here are religious doctrines that on their face claim that it is all right to mercilessly punish people for the wrongs of others and for blameless error, that license or even command murder, rape, torture, slavery, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. We know such actions are wrong."&lt;ref name="Anderson 2007 page=337"&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|2007|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackburn notes morally suspect themes in the Bible's New Testament as well.&lt;ref name="Blackburn 2001 11–12"&gt;{{harvnb|Blackburn|2001|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes some "moral quirks" of Jesus: that he could be "sectarian" (Matt 10:5–6), racist (Matt 15:26 and Mark 7:27), placed no value on animal life (Luke 8: 27–33), and believed that "mental illness is caused by possession by devils". He also did not repudiate any of the more brutal portions of the Old Testament.&lt;ref name="Blackburn 2001 11–12" /&gt; Anderson notes the Christian apologist argument that the Jesus of the New Testament is "all loving".&lt;ref name="Anderson 2007 page=338"&gt;{{harvnb|Anderson|2007|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; She states, however, that the New Testament has some morally repugnant lessons as well: "Jesus tells us his mission is to make family members hate one another, so that they shall love him more than their kin (Matt 10:35–37)", "Disciples must hate their parents, siblings, wives, and children (Luke 14:26)", children who "curse their parents&amp;nbsp;... must be killed", and Peter and Paul elevate men over their wives "who must obey their husbands " (1 Corinthians 11:3, 14:34–5, Eph. 5:22–24, Col. 3:18, 1 Tim. 2: 11–2, 1 Pet. 3:1)&lt;ref name="Anderson 2007 page=338" /&gt; in the [[New Testament household code]].

{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}

A '''coadjutor bishop''' (or '''bishop coadjutor''') is a bishop in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]], and (historically) [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches whose main role is to assist the [[diocesan bishop]] in the administration of the diocese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4pj9YNdgJYC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=coadjutor+orthodox&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sRX0COWlpq&amp;sig=ZXzkGIr6ptAn3jRQMTTiT7eLFoM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIvdvry-_SAhUNxmMKHSElBD8Q6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=coadjutor%20orthodox&amp;f=false|title=The Sabaite Heritage in the Orthodox Church from the Fifth Century to the Present|last=Patrich|first=Joseph|date=2001|publisher=Peeters Publishers|year=|isbn=9789042909762|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yp6oDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT184&amp;lpg=PT184&amp;dq=coadjutor+orthodox&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=788TgjrIQs&amp;sig=FmFLnOkU5l9jiYbXBJvt3MZ_M7A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIvdvry-_SAhUNxmMKHSElBD8Q6AEIODAI#v=onepage&amp;q=coadjutor%20orthodox&amp;f=false|title=The Latin Church in the Crusader States: The Secular Church|last=Hamilton|first=Bernard|date=2016-12-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351887052|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coadjutor (literally, "co-assister" in Latin) is a bishop himself, although he is also appointed as [[vicar general]]. The coadjutor bishop is, however, given authority beyond that ordinarily given to the vicar general, making him co-head of the diocese in all but ceremonial precedence. In modern times, the coadjutor automatically succeeds the diocesan bishop upon the latter's retirement, removal, or death.

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], a coadjutor bishop is an immediate collaborator of the diocesan bishop, similar to an [[auxiliary bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canon 403 §3 |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1F.HTM |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |work=1983 [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]] |accessdate=6 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115203240/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1F.HTM |archivedate=15 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canon 403 §1 |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1F.HTM |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |work=1983 [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]] |accessdate=6 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115203240/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1F.HTM |archivedate=15 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike auxiliary bishops, coadjutors are given the right of succession to the [[episcopal see]]. When the diocesan bishop dies, retires, resigns, or is reassigned, the coadjutor automatically becomes the next bishop of the [[Particular Church|local Church]] ([[diocese]]). Until then, the diocesan bishop appoints the coadjutor to act as [[vicar general]]. He needs to be a bishop, and, in a now-discontinued practice, held a [[titular see]] until his succession.

In modern church practice, the appointment of a coadjutor is usually done in cases where a diocesan bishop feels that he will not be able to continue in his position for health reasons or impending retirement. In such cases, the Pope may assign a coadjutor in order to give him time to become familiar with the diocese that he will eventually take over. For example, Bishop [[Dennis Marion Schnurr]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Duluth|Diocese of Duluth]], [[Minnesota]], was named Coadjutor Archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Archdiocese of Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], in 2008 to succeed aging Archbishop [[Daniel Edward Pilarczyk]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

At times, the appointment of a coadjutor is used to discreetly remove a diocesan bishop who has become involved in scandal or other problems. An example of this occurred in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque|Archdiocese of Dubuque]] in the 1940s, when Archbishop [[Francis Beckman]] involved the archdiocese in what turned out to be a dubious mining scheme. When the scheme fell apart and resulted in serious financial problems for Beckman and the archdiocese, Bishop [[Henry Rohlman]], of [[Davenport, Iowa]], was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Dubuque. While Beckman was allowed to retain the office of Archbishop, it was made clear to him by the [[Holy See]] that the actual power rested with Rohlman.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Prior to the reform of the [[Code of Canon Law]] in 1983, a distinction was made between coadjutor bishops ''cum jure succesionis'' ("with the right of succession") and those without. Some coadjutors were appointed with the right of succession, and others were without such a right, usually in archbishops with particularly large dioceses who also held other important posts and to honor certain auxiliary bishops).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

For an example of a coadjutor without right of succession, see [[John Maguire (coadjutor archbishop of New York)|John J. Maguire]], coadjutor archbishop of New York (1965-1980).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Now, every coadjutor who is appointed has the concomitant right of succession.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

An [[Apostolic Vicar]] may also have a coadjutor, who, like him, will be a [[titular bishop]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Anglican Communion==
In some [[province (Anglican)|provinces]] of the [[Anglican Communion]], a bishop coadjutor (the form usually used) is a bishop elected or appointed to follow the current diocesan bishop upon the incumbent's death or retirement. For example, in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], when a diocesan bishop announces a retirement, a special diocesan convention is held to elect a coadjutor. Usually, the coadjutor serves with the incumbent for a short time before the latter's retirement, when the coadjutor becomes the diocesan bishop. Bishops coadjutor are also appointed in the [[Reformed Episcopal Church]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The role of 'assistant-bishop' (with no expectation to succeed the diocesan see) in the [[Church of England]] is fulfilled by a [[suffragan bishop|suffragan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

There have been bishops coadjutor in the [[Anglican Church of Australia]] without the right of succession to the diocesan see.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The '''''Cojines del Zaque''''' (English: "Cushions of the ''Zaque''") is an archeological site of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] located in the city of [[Tunja]], [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]], which in the time of the [[Muisca Confederation]] was called Hunza. The ''cojines'' are two round stones used in the [[Muisca religion|religion]] of the Muisca to worship Sun god [[Sué]] and his wife; Moon goddess [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]]. When the Spanish [[conquistador]]es arrived, they called them ''Cojines del Diablo''.

== Background ==
During the time before the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]], the central highlands of the Colombian [[Andes]] ([[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]) were populated by the Muisca. This advanced civilization had its own religion and rituals, centered around the most important deities Sué and Chía. The northern territories were ruled by the ''[[iraca]]'' of [[Sogamoso|Sugamuxi]], the ''[[tundama]]'' of [[Duitama|Tundama]] and the ''[[zaque]]'' based in Hunza.

== Description ==
The Cojines are two circular stones made of sandstone located at the base of the San Lázaro hill in Tunja. The northernmost ''Cojín'' measures {{convert|1.1|m|ft}} in diameter and the southern pillow {{convert|1|m|ft}}. The stones are oriented with respect to the solar elliptic and consist of an inclined part in the west and a flat part in the east. The rocks were used by the ''zaque'' to kneel down and pray to Sué at sunrise.&lt;ref name=PueblosCojines&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/cojines.html Cojines del Zaque] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cojines were studied as of 1847 and in 1928 the city of Tunja made the stones into an [[List of Muisca and pre-Muisca sites|archeological site]].&lt;ref name=BancoCojines&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/publicacionesbanrep/bolmuseo/1992/endi3233/endi02ah.htm Archaeology of the Cojines del Zaque] - Banco de la República&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rituals and festivities ===
Every morning the ''zaque'' would go in a procession from his grand ''bohío'' in Hunza to the Cojines. Apart from the daily rituals, also with [[Muisca agriculture|sowing and harvests]], rituals were performed on the ''Cojines del Zaque''.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.colombia.travel/es/a-donde-ir/andina/tunja/actividades/conoce-los-cojines-del-zaque Rituals on the Cojines del Zaque]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Muisca calendar]] defined the months of sowing and harvests and those periods would fall on the [[Gregorian calendar]] in the months of March and September respectively. To increase the fertility of the lands the Muisca had their [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]], they performed festivities to the gods around the Cojines del Zaque. During these festivals, the Muisca danced in groups, holding hands and sang to the [[Muisca music|music]] of flutes, [[ocarina]]s and other instruments. They danced on the rhythm of drums. During these rituals the Muisca got drunk by drinking their typical ''[[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]]''.&lt;ref name=TunjaBlog&gt;{{es}} [http://tunjachc.blogspot.com.co/2011/10/los-cojines-del-zaque-uno-de-los.html Description Cojines del Zaque]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes twelve year-old boys; ''moxas'', captured from other indigenous peoples in the region would be sacrificed to the gods at the site of the Cojines del Zaque. The heads of the boys would be placed on the cojines and the children decapitated draining the Cojines in blood. The Muisca left their bodies lying there as food for Sué. The bodies would be retrieved after a few days.&lt;ref name=MitosTunja&gt;{{es}} [http://eutimioreyesmanosalva.jimdo.com/libros-e-r-m/leyendas-mitos-espantos-y-romer%C3%ADas-de-tunja/ Leyendas, mitos, espantos y romerías de Tunja]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diocese  of Kotayk''' ({{lang-hy|Կոտայքի թեմ}} ''Kotayki t'em''), is a diocese of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] covering the [[Kotayk Province]] of [[Armenia]]. The name is derived from the historic ''Kotayk canton'' of [[Ayrarat]] province of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia Major]].

The diocese was officially founded on May 30, 1996, upon a [[kontakion]] issued by Catholicos [[Karekin I]]. The diocesan headquarters are located in the provincial capital [[Hrazdan]], while the cathedral of the diocese is the [[Kecharis Monastery]] in the nearby town of [[Tsaghkadzor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armenianchurch.org/index.jsp?sid=1&amp;id=89&amp;pid=19&amp;lng=en|title=The Armenian Church - Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Diocese of Kotayk is considered the successor of the historic ''Diocese of Bjni'' founded by Catholicos [[Peter I of Armenia|Peter I]] in 1031. Bjni was one of the largest dioceses of medieval Armenia. The bishop of Bjni was one of 4 bishops that possessed a special privilege in the election of the Catholicos of All Armenians, others being the bishops of Syunik, Haghpat and Artaz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaykitem.am/node/18|title=Կոտայքի թեմ - Հայաստանյայց Առաքելական Սուրբ Եկեղեցի Կոտայքի Թեմ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Diocese of Bjni has been intact until the mid 18th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1100">In [[Roman mythology]], '''Entoria''' was the daughter of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] countryman. [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] who was once hospitably received by him, became, by Entoria, the father of four sons: [[Janus]], Hymnus, Faustus, and Felix.

Cronos taught the father the cultivation of the [[vine]] and the preparation of [[wine]], enjoining him to teach his neighbours the same. This was done accordingly, but the country people, who became intoxicated with their new drink, thought it to be poison, and stoned their neighbour to death, whereupon his grandsons hung themselves in their grief.

At a much later time, when the Romans were visited by a plague, they were told by the Delphic oracle, that the plague was a punishment for the outrage committed on Entoria's father, and Lutatius Catulus caused a temple to be erected to Cronos on the Tarpeian rock, and in it an altar with four faces.&lt;ref&gt;Plut. Parall. Gr. et Rom. 9. (cited by Schmitz)&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Latopolis" is in honor of the [[Nile perch]], ''Lates niloticus'', the largest of the 52 species which inhabit the Nile,&lt;ref&gt;Russegger, ''Reisen'', vol. I. p.300&lt;/ref&gt; which was abundant in these stretches of the river in ancient times, and which appears in sculptures, among the symbols of the goddess [[Neith]], associated by the [[ancient Greeks]] as [[Athena|Pallas-Athene]], surrounded by the oval shield or ring indicative of royalty or divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, M. and C. vol. V. p.253&lt;/ref&gt; Held sacred, the ''Lates niloticus'' was buried in a cemetery west of the town.

The [[Egyptian temple|temple]] of Esna, dedicated to the god [[Khnum]], his consorts [[Menhit]] and [[Nebtu]], their son, [[Heka (god)|Heka]], and also the goddess [[Neith]]&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn A. Bard (editor), ''Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt'' (1999), p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;, was remarkable for the beauty of its site and the magnificence of its architecture. It was built of red sandstone, and its portico consisted of six rows of four columns each, with lotus-leaf capitals, all of which however differ from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique-Vivant Denon, ''Voyage dans la Basse et lau Haute Égypte'', vol. I. (1818), p.148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another temple of the same period has been identified at Kom Mer, about 12&amp;nbsp;km to the south, but cannot be excavated because a modern village is built over it.

There was a smaller temple, dedicated to the triad of Latopolis, about two miles and a half north of the city, at a village now called el-Dayr. Here, too, is a small Zodiac of the age of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] (246-221 BC). This latter building was destroyed in the 19th century, as it stood in the way of a new canal. The temple of Esna was cleared of the soil and rubbish which filled its area when Denon visited it, and served as a cotton warehouse in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Richard Lepsius, ''Nubische Grammatik mit einer Einleitung über die Völker und Sprachen Afrika's. Berlin: Verlag von Wilhelm Hertz'' (1880), p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of the jamb of a gateway &amp;ndash; now converted into a door-sill &amp;ndash; of the reign of [[Thutmose II]] ([[Eighteenth Dynasty]]), the remains of Latopolis belong to the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] or [[Roman Empire|Roman]] eras. [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], the restorer of so many temples in [[Upper Egypt]], was a benefactor to Latopolis, and he is depicted upon the walls of its temple followed by a tame lion, and in the act of striking down the chiefs of his enemies. The name of [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]] is found also inscribed upon a doorway. Although the scale of the ruins are impressive, their sculptures and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] attest to the decline of Egyptian art. The west wall features reliefs of [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]] and [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]]. The pronaos, which alone exists, resembles in style that of [[Apollonopolis Magna]] ([[Edfu]]), and was begun not earlier than the reign of [[Claudius]] (41-54 AD), and completed in that of [[Vespasian]], whose name and titles are carved on the dedicatory inscription over the entrance. On the ceiling of the pronaos is the larger Latopolitan Zodiac. The name of the emperor [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]], the last ruler that can be read in hieroglyphics, although partially erased by his brother and murderer [[Caracalla]] (212), is still legible on the walls of Latopolis. Before raising their own edifice, the Romans seem to have destroyed even the basements of the earlier Egyptian temple. The ceremonial way, which probably linked the quay to the temple, has disappeared. The quay bears cartouches of [[Marcus Aurelius]].

The cemetery west of the town, where the ''Lates niloticus'' was buried, also contains human burials dating of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] to the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]].

===Ritual significance===
[[File:Egypt.Esna.Temple.02.jpg|right|thumb|Twilight over the temple]]

The Temple of Esna conveys a sense of the importance which the Ancient Egyptians placed upon their places of worship. All Egyptians who entered the confines of an Egyptian temple were required "to comply with the strict rules regarding ritual purity."&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Gahlin, Egypt: Gods, Myths and Religion, Anness Publishing Litd (Lorenz Books) 2001. p.106&lt;/ref&gt; According to inscriptions carved on the walls of the Temple of Esna, those who entered this temple were expected to fastidiously cut their fingernails and toenails, remove other body hair, wash their hands with [[natron]] (a natural occurring salt), "be dressed in linen (they were forbidden from wearing wool), and not to have had sexual intercourse for several days."&lt;ref&gt;Gahlin, p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Esna ==
[[File:Esclosa-edfu.png|thumb|[[Lock (water transport)|Canal lock]]]]

Two barrage bridges straddle the [[Nile]] at this point: one built by the British in 1906, and the "Electricity Bridge" built in the 1990s. Navigation, particularly, Nile cruisers ferrying tourists from [[Luxor]] to [[Aswan]] 155&amp;nbsp;km further upstream, can be held up for hours while vessels negotiate their way through the lock system.

The two main points of interest in Esna are its lively tourist-oriented market, which fills a couple of streets leading inland from the [[corniche]]. The other is the temple of Esna. The temple, which has only been partially excavated, is about 200 meters from the river and some 9 meters below street level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2567">The ''' Four Heavenly Ministers ''' ({{zh|c=四御|p= Sì yù }}), also translated as the '''Four Sovereigns''', are four of the highest [[sky deities]] of [[Taoism|Taoist religion]], and subordinate only to the [[Three Pure Ones]] ({{zh|c=三清|p=Sān qīng}}). They assist the [[Three Pure Ones]] in administering all phenomenon of the universe. &lt;ref&gt;《道法會元卷之三》&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolff2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Wolff|title=The Popular Encyclopedia of World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9Ls4I5t5gIC&amp;pg=PA121|year=2007|publisher=Harvest House Publishers|isbn=978-0-7369-2007-0|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Four Heavenly Ministers are: The [[Jade Emperor|Great Jade Emperor]]  ({{zh|c=玉皇大帝|p= yù huáng dà dì }}), the [[Zi wei emperor|Great Emperor of Middle Heaven North Star]] ({{zh|c=中天紫微北極大帝|p= Zhōngtiān Zǐwēi Běijí Dàdì }}), the [[Great Emperor of Polaris]] ({{zh|c=勾陳大帝|p= gōuchén shàng dàdì}}), and [[Houtu|the Imperial God of Earth]] ({{zh|c=后土皇地祇|p= hòutǔ huáng dìqí}}).&lt;ref&gt;《三教源流搜神大全》&lt;/ref&gt;


The [[Jade Emperor|Great Jade Emperor]] is the head of all [[sky deities]] and presides over the heaven. The [[Zi wei emperor|Great Emperor of Middle Heaven North Star]] assists the [[Jade Emperor]] in managing the sun, the moon, stars, and the climate of the four seasons. The [[Great Emperor of Polaris]] oversees all matters in heaven, earth and human world.  [[Houtu|The Imperial God of Earth]] is in charge of fertility, land, rivers, and mountains. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=《文獻通考_(四庫全書本)》|date=|wslanguage=zh|wslink=文獻通考_(四庫全書本)/卷278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four heavenly ministers are often worshiped in Taoist temples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3092">'''Gun Ana''' (Turkish: ''Gün Ana'', Kyrgyz: ''Күн Эне'', Kazakh: ''Күн Ана'', Hungarian: ''Nap Anya'', Sakha: ''Күн Ий̃э'', Balkar: ''Кюн Ана'', Ottoman: ''گون آنا'') is the common Turkic solar deity, treated as a goddess in the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] and [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] mythologies. The noun Gün in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and Kyrgyz languages is also the conventional name for the Sun and originates from the Proto-Turkic name Kün.

== Background ==
Gün Ana is one of the most powerful deities, the goddess of life and fertility, warmth and health. She is patroness of the unfortunate, especially orphans. She lives on the seventh floor of the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Anadolu Alevi Kültüründe Kadın, Hüseyin Özcan [http://turkoloji.cu.edu.tr/HALKBILIM/huseyin_ozcan_anadolu_alevi_kulturu_kadina_bakis_temeller.pdf "Gün Ana"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziya Gökalp, Türk Medeniyeti Tarihi II, İstanbul, 1974, s. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tengrism|Gök Tanrı]] created the earth with rays of sun light, thus, Gun Ana took part in the creation of earth. Solar rays are also considered to be "strings" between the sun and the spirits of plants, animals and humans. Turks who worship Gun Ana turn towards the sunrise when praying. She is depicted with glowing yellow skin.

== References in literature ==
Gün Ana is mentioned in one of the earliest written sources on [[Turkish mythology]]. According to Turkic traditions, the powerful god Kayra made the Sun and threw it into the sky. Gün Ana and [[Ay Ata]] (the Moon) were wife and husband.

According to Turkic Mythology, Khagan and his wife are supposed to be the children of the sky and the [[Yer-sub|Yer]] (Land). Ay Ata (living in the sixth floor) and Gün Ana (living in the seventh floor) are their representatives in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Got from Turkish wikipedia; Ziya Gökalp şöyle demektedir: "Eski Türk telakkisine göre, hakanla hatun gök ile yerin evlatlarıydı. Günes ana ile Ay ata onların gök yüzündeki temsilcileri idi. Hakanın mümessili olan ay ata, gök yüzünün altıncı katında, hatunun mümessili olan gün ana ise daha üstte, gökyüzünün yedinci katında idi."&lt;/ref&gt;

The feast for Gün Ana is celebrated during the summer solstice in [[Northern Hemisphere]] on each 21 June.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3686">There are about 800 Indian families in Mexico, constituting a total number of about 900 [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRIs]]. Most of them are recent arrivals in the country. There is a big presence of recently arrived Indians working for [[Tata Group|Tata]] Consultancy Services in Guadalajara, Querétaro and Mexico City. Mexico has a non-discriminatory policy with regard to the grant of its citizenship. The spouse of a Mexican national would generally not face any problem in acquiring local citizenship. But although quite a few NRIs have married Mexicans, they have retained their Indian citizenship.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Status of Indians in Mexico==
The Indians in this country are mainly businessmen or professionals. Many of them work with one or other international organisation or a multinational corporation.
There are also some academicians and scientists among them. They have helped to bring about greater mutual understanding between India and their host country. At present, Dr Sanjay Rajaram (a distinguished Indian scientist and [[Padma Shri]] award recipient) is also in Mexico, working at [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center|CIMMYT]]. Some of the Indians work for [[Ispat International|ISPAT Mexicana]]. This company is part of the [[ArcelorMittal|Laxmi Mittal group]], well known in this region for having turned around a sinking steel company in Trinidad. The Indian presence in Mexico has been greatly appreciated as fifty other business ventures have invested around US$1.58 billion in this country during the period 1994-2000.
Most members of the diaspora speak Spanish and have adapted themselves admirably to their foreign environment.

==Indian Organisation in Mexico==
The Indian community in Mexico has no divisive factions in it, although its constituents come from different parts of India. It has jointly established an organisation called [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|Sangam]], under whose auspices it celebrates important festivals and cultural programmes.

==Temples in Mexico==

{{rough translation|Danish|date=May 2012}}

'''Jens Johannes Jørgensen''' (6 November 1866 in Svendborg – 29 May 1956) was a Danish writer, best known for his biographies of Catholic saints. He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] five times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=4673 |title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early days==
Johannes Jørgensen was born in 1866 in [[Svendborg]], Denmark.
In 1884, he travelled to Copenhagen to start his studies,&lt;ref name="johs_selskab"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.johannesjoergensenselskabet.dk/255396450 |title=Johannes Jørgensen Selskabet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but he quit his studies in 1888.&lt;ref name="den_store_danske"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://denstoredanske.dk/index.php?sideId=102820 |title= Johannes Jørgensen |last= Lundgreen-Nielsen |first= Flemming |website= Den Store Danske |publisher= Gyldendal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Copenhagen he began to develop radical social views, which soon led him into a circle of [[Cultural radicalism|cultural and radical]] artists.

He was fascinated by the Russian nihilists and by [[Georg Brandes]] who boasted of dispelling "the darkness of Christianity." He led a life of pleasure and married, but his happiness did not last. New voices announcing spiritual values were then being heard in Denmark. Jørgensen read [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] and others. He broke with Georg Brandes and his school, which would later cause his ruin.

==The young poet==
[[File:JohsJorgens(Ballin).jpg|thumb|left|Johannes Jørgensen by Mogens Ballin, 1894]]
[[File:Taarnet.jpg|thumb|right|The house with tower in Frederiksberg, from journal ''The Tower'' got its name.]]
From his earliest years, he had shown a strong love of poetry through which he could express his dreams and observations. For rest of his life, poetry remained as one of his prominent modes of expression.

But with his innate melancholy temperament, he found no permanent place in [[cultural radicalism]] and materialism, where [[Eros]] and [[connoisseur]], summarized in [[pantheism]]'s worship of nature was prevalent. Therefore, he began a quest for more spiritually motivated sources of inspiration together with like-minded people. 
As an editor of the magazine ''The Tower'' (''Taarnet'' in Danish) in the years 1893-94, he had an outlet for his expressing his ideas about [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], and his opposition to [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]].&lt;ref name="dsd_taarnet"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://denstoredanske.dk/index.php?sideId=176081 |title=Taarnet |last=Brostrøm |first=Torben |website=Den Store Danske |publisher=Gyldendal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolists quickly came across the prevailing literary circles, in particular, the brothers [[Georg Brandes|Georg]] and [[Edvard Brandes]], who did not spare the young rebels.

Johannes Jørgensen then met a young Jewish silversmith, [[Mogens Ballin]], who had converted to Catholicism. He had not reached the spiritual depth he had sought. From his childhood home he had inherited an entrenched base of Christianity, and even at his most radical period this base never quite left him. It now returned in the form of [[Christian mysticism|mysticism]]. It took a long time with many internal battles before he found the port of spiritual comfort, though many internal and external factors constantly tore at him.

==Conversion to the Catholic Church==
In 1894 Jørgensen (together with [[Mogens Ballin]]) first visited the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi]]. It was the beginning of what would come to fill most of his future life as both man and writer – namely the love of the Holy St. Francis, Assisi's famous son who was born here and worked here until he died in 1226. The close friendship with [[Mogens Ballin]] and visiting the Basilica of St. Francis led to his conversion to Catholicism in 1896, a crucial turning point in his writing.

==Saint biographies==
In 1907 Jørgensen finished his biography of St. Francis, a book which would make him famous and an honorary citizen both in Assisi and later also in his native town of Svendborg. He had previously worked with the saint from Assisi. In 1902 he had translated ''[[Fioretti]]'' into Danish, and the following year he had published a book with the Pilgrim's depiction of the Franciscan sites.

The Franciscan'a spirituality came to dominate his thoughts. In 1915 settled in Assisi, only interrupted by the war years 1943–1945 when he traveled to [[Vadstena]], Sweden to live and begin his great work on [[St. Birgitta]]. It was his third major biography of saints, following the book of [[St. Catherine of Siena]] (1915). His embracing of the Franciscan spirit led to a series of books based on the [[Umbria]]n world where spirit and nature always led to a higher unity.

Johannes Jørgensen's life had had an almost sentimental affinity to nature, seasons, flowers and life's affirmative diversity. This had developed into a pantheistic natural worship in his youth. But in the depiction of St. Francis's relationship with nature as God's true image, the two passion within him merged – nature and God. The deity who in his youth was the human relationship to nature now turned into an expression of God's truth.

==Home to Denmark==
[[File:Johannes Jorgensen Svendborg 9 Mindesten.JPG|thumb|200px|right|At the 50-year anniversary of Johannes Jørgensen's death in 2006 a memorial was erected in Svendborg for the city's honorary citizen.]]

After the war ended he returned to Assisi, but age was starting to weigh him down. In 1952 he moved back to Svendborg, where the city offered him free honorary residence in his childhood home of Lady Alley.

In 1913 he left his wife, Amalie F. Ewald and their seven children after an increasingly problematic marriage. As a Catholic he could not remarry, but when Amalie died in 1935, he married (in 1937) the Austrian-born Helen Klein.

He became an honorary citizen of Assisi 1922 and in Svendborg 1936 and dr. phil. hc ved Universitetet i Louvain 1927. Moreover, he was made Knight of the Dannebrog in 1920 and Commander of the 2nd grade 1926 . degree 1926.{{clarify|date=May 2012}}

Johannes Jørgensen died on 29 May 1956, almost 90 years old. He was buried at the city cemetery.

==Analyzing his works==
Johannes Jørgensen's writing is difficult to categorize.

His Catholicism made him interesting far outside the Catholic Church. In his travel books he can be compared to Fyn [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. His sublime sense of language has made him loved by many. While in Denmark he was a stranger, so his writing enjoyed much more attention at home than abroad, while Hans Christian Andersen is often translated from Danish.

Johannes Jørgensen's poetry is perhaps the most interesting part of his writing, and many read his poems in his homeland. Many look even today at his poetry for his beautiful styling and incomparable natural sense.

== Kaj Munk ==
Following the murder of [[Kaj Munk]] on 4 January 1944 the Danish resistance newspaper [[De frie Danske]] brought condemning reactions from influential Scandinavians, including Jørgensen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= KAJ MUNK IN MEMORIAM |url= http://www.illegalpresse.dk/papers#/paper?paper=68&amp;page=685 |newspaper=[[De frie Danske]] |date= January 1944 |page= 6 |quote= En stor Skjald, en Kristen, en stor Dramatiker er faldet for Morderhaand. Hans Minde vil leve paa Nordens Himmel som en blodig Bethlehemsstjerne | accessdate=18 November 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Among his works are:
* ''A Stranger'' – novel, 1890
* ''Moods'' – poems, 1892
* ''Summer'' – novel, 1892
* ''Confession'' – poems, 1894
* ''Homesickness'' – novel, 1894
* ''Pilgrim Book'' – travelogue, 1903
* ''St. Francis of Assisi'' – Biography, 1907
 
In the 18th edition of the ''Danish Folk High School Songbook'' there are three poems by John Jørgensen: Francis of Assisi Solsang "Almighty and dear God", "Now lit foliage in forests" and "Lay down your head, you blossom".

[[File:Hawaiian Kahuna Kahiko (PP-33-11-023).jpg|300px|thumb|''Kahuna'' (c. 1890)]]
'''Kahuna''' is a [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word, defined as a respectful man who has moral authority in society "a prime person, a minister, or an expert in any profession".&lt;ref name="def of kahuna ulukau"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kahuna|url=http://wehewehe.org/gsdl2.85/cgi-bin/hdict?e=q-11000-00---off-0hdict--00-1----0-10-0---0---0direct-10-ED--4-------0-1lpm--11-haw-Zz-1---Zz-1-home-kahuna--00-3-1-00-0--4----0-0-11-00-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;d=D6052|website=Ulukau Hawaiian Electronic Dictionary|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merriam-Webster defines kahuna as "a preeminent person or thing" and "Hawaiian [[shaman]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merriam-Webster|title=Kahuna|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kahuna|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Native Hawaiians#Hawaiian cultural revival|revival of the Hawaiian culture]] beginning in the 1970s, some native Hawaiian cultural practitioners call themselves kahuna today. Others disdain the term. In the [[New Age]] spiritual system known as  [[Huna (New Thought)|Huna]], which uses Hawaiian words and is adapted from Hawaiian tradition, ''kahuna'' similarly denotes someone of priestly or shamanic standing.&lt;ref name="King2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Serge Kahili King|title=Kahuna Healing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVtbBgAAQBAJ|date=2014-05-27|publisher=Quest Books|isbn=978-0-8356-3107-5|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
A kahuna may be versed in agriculture,&lt;ref name="Kia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Waipi'o Valley with Kia Fronda 1992 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnRj-q-QlIY |website=YouTube |publisher=Rusty Wright |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kathy_Long_The_Three_Kahunas"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Three Kahunas |url=http://kathylongartist.com/product/the-three-kahunas/ |website=Kathy Long Artist |publisher=Kathy Long |accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; canoe building or any other talent. Blessing new buildings and construction projects, officiating weddings are some of the tasks a kahuna may be called upon to perform, by his or her community.&lt;ref name="US_Census"&gt;{{cite web|title=David "Daddy" Kaonohiokala Bray|url=https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/davidbray542017.pdf|website=US Census|publisher=US Census|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinze1991" /&gt; 

Forty types of kahuna are listed in the book ''Tales from the Night Rainbow'', twenty in the healing professions alone, including "Kahuna lapaʻau, medical priest or practitioner", and "Kahuna hāhā, an expert who diagnoses, as sickness or pain, by feeling the body".&lt;ref name="Page 46"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawaiian Dictionary: Page 46 haʻe - -hahau.hia|url=http://www.ulukau.org/elib/collect/ped/index/assoc/D0.dir/doc82.pdf|website=Ulukau: The Hawaii Electronic Library|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are two categories of kahuna; craft kahuna, such as kālai wa{{okina}}a, an expert canoe maker, and ho{{okina}}okele, an expert navigator; and sorcery kahuna such as "kahuna ʻanā{{okina}}anā" and "kahuna lapa{{okina}}au" (healer).&lt;ref name="kahuna lapaʻau"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ulukau: The Hawaii Electronic Library|url=http://www.ulukau.org/elib/collect/ped/index/assoc/D0.dir/doc233.pdf|website=ulukau.org|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to sources, there are ten types (or ranks) of sorcery kahuna:
# Kuhikuhi pu{{okina}}uone (literally "to direct divination"): one who locates the site for the construction of [[heiau]], or temples.&lt;ref name="kuhikuhi definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Page 173 kū.hala.kai - kū.hipa|url=http://www.ulukau.org/elib/collect/ped/index/assoc/D0.dir/doc211.pdf|website=Ulukau: The Hawaii Electronic Library|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Oneoneihonua: one who performs the human sacrifices at the [[luakini]] [[heiau]].

Expert kahuna are called ''Kahuna Nui'' ([[High Priest]]) and Kahuna Nui lived in places such as [[Waimea Valley]], which is known as the "Valley of the Priests". They were given slices of land that spanned from the mountain to the sea.&lt;ref name="Valley_of_the_Priests"&gt;{{cite web |title=Waimea Valley |url=http://www.hawaiipictureoftheday.com/waimea-valley/ |website=Hawaii.com |accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="waimeavalley"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Waimea Valley|url=https://www.waimeavalley.net/about/view/history-of-waimea-valley-botanical-gardens|website=Waimeavalley.net|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hewahewa]], a direct descendant of [[Paʻao]], was the ''Kahuna Nui'' to [[Kamehameha I]].

King [[Kamehameha IV]], in his translation of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], used the term ''Kahuna'' to refer to [[Anglican priest]]s and ''Kahunapule'' to refer to both lay and ordained Anglican ministers.

== Legal status ==
Craft kahuna were never prohibited; however, during the decline of native Hawaiian culture many died out and did not pass on their wisdom to new students. As an example, when the ''[[Hokulea|Hōkūle&amp;lsquo;a]]'' was built to be sailed to the South Pacific to prove the voyaging capabilities of the ancient Hawaiians, master navigator [[Mau Piailug]] from [[Satawal]] was brought to Hawaii to teach the Hawaiians navigation.&lt;ref name="voyaging revival 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perez|first1=Christina|last2=George KO|first2=Brendan|title=hawaii hokulea canoe polynesian sailing/|url=https://www.vogue.com/projects/13534632/hawaii-hokulea-canoe-polynesian-sailing/|accessdate=27 May 2018|work=Vogue|date=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often said that the missionaries came to Hawaii in 1820 and made kahuna practices illegal. In the 100 years after the missionaries arrived all kahuna practices were legal until 1831, some were illegal until 1863, all were legal until 1887, then some were illegal until 1919. Since 1919, all have been legal, except sorcery, which was illegal at first, but was decriminalized in 1972.&lt;ref name="Chai2005"&gt;{{Citation

The first [[List of Missionaries to Hawaii|Christian missionaries]] arrived in 1820. The most powerful person in the nation, [[Kaʻahumanu]], did not convert until 1825. But it was not until 11 years after missionaries arrived that she proclaimed laws against [[hula]], [[chant]], ‘awa ([[kava]]), and [[Hawaiian religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamakau, Ruling Chiefs, p. 298-301.&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Kamehameha V]] came to power in 1863. He disdained the law and encouraged the revival of native practices. (Chai) Many kahuna who had been quietly practicing came forward. On Maui, a group of eight Hawaiians founded the '' 'Ahahui La'au Lapa'au'' in 1866. They were not only kahuna; several were also members of the Hawaiian Legislature.  They interviewed twenty-one kahuna to compile a complete resource of prayers and remedies for the Legislative record. (These interviews have been republished in the book ''Must We Wait in Despair?'' by Malcolm Naea Chun.)

Both Kamehameha V and his successor, King [[Kalakaua]], invited kahuna to come to Honolulu to share their wisdom.  They compiled oral and written histories and documented the prayers, chants, hulas, and remedies for healings. Kalakaua convened groups of kahuna to consult with each other to preserve their heritage. This and many other moves by Kalakaua outraged the Christian residents. In 1887 they forced the [[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii|Bayonet Constitution]] upon the King, stripping him of most of his personal authority.

While all this legal maneuvering has been going on, many traditional practitioners have continued to practice as they and their ancestors have always done. 

==Non-Hawaiian uses==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Beach blanket bingo333.jpg|thumb|150px|The term "Big Kahuna" was used in 1965 film [[Beach Blanket Bingo]]]] --&gt;

The use of the term in reference to [[surfing]] can be traced back to the 1959 film ''[[Gidget (film)|Gidget]]'', in which "The Big Kahuna", played by [[Cliff Robertson]], ([[Martin Milner]] in the TV episode), was the leader of a group of surfers. The term then became commonplace in [[Beach Party film]]s of the 1960s such as ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'', where the "Big Kahuna" was the best surfer on the beach. Eventually, it was adopted into general surfing culture. Hawaiian surfing master [[Duke Kahanamoku]] may have been referred to as the "Big Kahuna" but rejected the term as he knew the original meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In the 1999 movie ''[[The Big Kahuna (film)|The Big Kahuna]]'' salesmen are trying to get a lucrative contract with a manufacturer they refer to as the "great kahuna". In a fantasy scene, [[Kevin Spacey]]'s character wears a headdress and is revered as "the big kahuna".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Kahuna' no more than guys talking |last=Rosen |first=Steven |url=http://extras.denverpost.com/scene/kahuna0519.htm |accessdate=2016-07-22 |newspaper=Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also used by [[Wally Amos]] in his cookie business, The Cookie Kahuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story|url=https://www.cookiekahuna.com/pages/the-story|publisher=The Cookie Kahuna|accessdate=1 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular culture, the island leaders in [[Pokémon Sun and Moon]] are called Kahunas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5893">'''Kuksu''', also called the '''Kuksu Cult''', was a religion in [[Northern California]] practiced by members within several [[Indigenous peoples of California]] before and during contact with the arriving European settlers. The religious belief system was held by several tribes in [[Central California]] and [[Northern California]], from the [[Sacramento Valley]] west to the [[Pacific Ocean]].

The practice of Kuksu religion included elaborate narrative ceremonial dances and specific regalia. The men of the tribe practiced [[rituals]] to ensure good health, bountiful harvests, hunts, fertility, and good weather. Ceremonies included an annual mourning ceremony, [[rites of passage]], and intervention with the [[Spirit|spirit world]]. A male [[secret society]] met in underground dance rooms and danced in disguises at the public dances.&lt;ref name="Kroeber07"&gt;Kroeber, Alfred L. ''The Religion of the Indians of California'', 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maidu.com/maidu/maiduculture/kuksu.html The Kuksu Cult paraphrased from Kroeber.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011234014/http://www.maidu.com/maidu/maiduculture/kuksu.html |date=2006-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuksu has been identified [[archaeologically]] by the discovery of underground dance rooms and wooden dance drums.

==Northern Kuksu religion==

===Patwin===
The [[Patwin]] culture of Northern California had comparatively strong and noticeable Kuksu systems and rituals.&lt;ref name="Kroeber07"/&gt;

===Maidu===
The [[Maidu]] culture of Northern California had comparatively strong and noticeable Kuksu systems and rituals.&lt;ref name="Kroeber07"/&gt;

===Pomo===
{{see also|Pomo mythology}}

Kuksu was personified as a spirit being by the [[Pomo people]]. Their [[mythology]] and dance ceremonies were witnessed, including the spirit of Kuksu or Guksu, between 1892 and 1904. The Pomo used the name ''Kuksu'' or  ''Guksu'', depending on the dialect, as the name for a red-beaked supernatural being, that lived in a [[sweathouse]] at the southern end of the world. Healing was his province and specialty. The person who played the Kuksu/Guksu in Pomo dance ceremonies was often considered the [[medicine man]], and dressed as him when attending the sick.&lt;ref&gt;Barret (1917): 423, 430-431&lt;/ref&gt; A ceremony dance was named after him. He also appeared in costume at most ceremonies briefly in order to take away the villager's illnesses.

All males were expected to join a ceremonial society; some of their dances were private or secret from women and children.  Scholars differ in their opinions of the societies' power in the tribe: "There was no secret society of importance as there was among the Maidu and presumedly among the neighboring [[Wintun]], and no organized priesthood vested with control over ceremonies."&lt;ref&gt;Barret 398&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in 1925 a witness of the [[Clear Lake Pomo]] said: "The heart of religious activities lay in a secret society called ''kuhma'', akin to that of the [[Patwin]] and Maidu and composed chiefly of men, which managed the ritual of the ancient ''hindil'' or kuksu religion.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford 353&lt;/ref&gt;

==Southern Kuksu religion==
The ethnohistorian [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] observed that Kuksu existed, but had less "specialized [[cosmogony]]," in the "southern Kuksu-dancing groups" of the [[Ohlone|Ohlone/Costanoan]], [[Salinan]], [[Miwok]] and [[Esselen]] and northernmost [[Yokuts]], in comparison to the groups in the Northern California and northern [[Sacramento Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber (1925) 445: "It is true the Costanoan and Salinan stocks, who participate in the Kuksu cult and live in the same transverse belt of California as the Miwok, seem also to lean in their mythology toward the Yokuts more than to the Sacramento Valley tribes. A less specialized type of cosmogony is therefore indicated for the southern Kuksu-dancing groups. [1. If, as seems probable, the southerly Kuksu tribes (the Miwok, Costanoans, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts) had no real society in connection with their Kuksu ceremonies, the distinctness of their mythology appears less surprising.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miriam Schapiro''' (also known as Mimi) (November 15, 1923 – June 20, 2015) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]]-born artist based in the [[United States]].  She was a painter, sculptor, printmaker, and a pioneer of [[feminist art]]. She was also considered a leader of the [[Pattern and Decoration]] art movement.&lt;ref name="cotternyt"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Schapiro's artwork blurs the line between fine art and craft. She incorporated craft elements into her paintings due to their association with women and femininity.  Schapiro’s work touches on the issue of feminism and art: especially in the aspect of feminism in relation to abstract art.  Schapiro honed in her domesticated craft work and was able to create work that stood amongst the rest of the high art. These works represent Schapiro’s identity as an artist working in the center of contemporary abstraction and simultaneously as a feminist being challenged to represent women’s "consciousness" through imagery.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She often used icons that are associated with women, such as hearts, floral decorations, geometric patterns, and the color pink. In the 1970s she made the hand fan, a typically small woman's object, heroic by painting it six feet by twelve feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stein|first1=Linda|title=Miriam Schapiro: Woman-Warrior with Lace|journal=Fiberarts|date=1998|issue=24|pages=35–40|ref=Art Full Text (H.W. Wilson).}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The fan-shaped canvas, a powerful icon, gave Schapiro the opportunity to experiment... Out of this emerged a surface of textured coloristic complexity and opulence that formed the basis of her new personal style. The kimonos, fans, houses, and hearts were the form into which she repeatedly poured her feelings and desires, her anxieties, and hopes".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Miriam Schapiro's estate is exclusively represented by the Eric Firestone Gallery in New York.

==Early life and education==
Schapiro was born in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref name=Bloch /&gt; She was the only child of two Russian Jewish parents. Her Russian immigrant grandfather invented the first movable doll’s eye in the United States&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.widewalls.ch/artist/miriam-schapiro/|title=Miriam Schapiro|last=Ficpatrik|first=Milja|date=|website=Widewalls|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and manufactured "Teddy Bears."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/schapiro-miriam|title=MIRIAM SCHAPIRO|last=Salus|first=Carol|date=2009|website=Jewish Women's Archive|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Theodore Schapiro, was an artist and an intellectual who was studying at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, in New York, when Schapiro was born. He was an industrial design artist who fostered her desire to be an artist and served as her role model and mentor. Her mother, Fannie Cohen,a homemaker and a Zionist, encouraged Schapiro to take up a career in the arts. At age six, Schapiro began drawing.&lt;ref name="Gouma-Peterson"&gt;Gouma-Peterson, Thalia.  Miriam Schapiro: An Art of Becoming.  American Art 11.1 (1997) :  10-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Schapiro was taught by Victor d’ Amico, her first modernist teacher at the Museum of Modern Art. In the evenings she joined WPA classes for adults to study drawing from the nude model. In 1943, Schapiro entered Hunter College in New York City, but eventually transferred to the University of Iowa. At the University of Iowa, Schapiro studied painting with Stuart Edie and James Lechay. She studied printmaking under [[Mauricio Lasansky]] and was his personal assistant, which then led her to help form the Iowa Print Group.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Miriam Schapiro: Shaping the Fragments of Art and Life|last=Gouma-Peterson|first=Thalia|publisher=Harry N. Abrams Publishers|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasanky taught his students to use several different printing techniques in their work and to study the masters' work in order to find solutions to technical problems.

At the [[State University of Iowa]] she met the artist [[Paul Brach]], whom she married in 1946.&lt;ref name="Bloch"&gt;Avital H. Bloch, Lauri Umansky, ''Impossible to Hold: Women and Culture in the 1960s'', NYU Press, 2005, p319. {{ISBN|0-8147-9910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Brach and Schapiro graduated in 1949, Brach received a  job in the University of Missouri as a painting instructor. Schapiro did not receive a position, and was very unhappy during their time there. By 1951 they moved to [[New York City]] and befriended many of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract expressionist]] artists of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], including [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[Knox Martin]] and [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]].  Schapiro and Brach lived in New York City during the 1950s and 1960s. Miriam and Paul had a son, Peter Brach, in 1955. Before and after the birth of her son Peter, Schapiro struggled with her identity and place as an artist. Miriam’s Schapiro’s successive studios, after this period of crisis, became both environments for and reflections of the changes in her life and art.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She died on June 20, 2015 in [[Hampton Bays, New York]], aged 91.&lt;ref&gt;http://hyperallergic.com/216461/remembering-miriam-schapiro-1923-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/arts/design/miriam-schapiro-91-a-feminist-artist-who-harnessed-craft-and-pattern-dies.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Schapiro not only honored the craft tradition in women's art, but also paid homage to women artists of the past. In the early 1970s she made paintings and collages which included photo reproductions of past artists such as [[Mary Cassatt]]. In the mid 1980s she painted portraits of [[Frida Kahlo]] on top of her old self-portrait paintings. In the 1990s Schapiro began to include women of the Russian Avant Garde in her work. The Russian Avant Garde was an important moment in Modern Art history for Schapiro to reflect on because women were seen as equals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richmond|first1=Susan|title=Gainesville, Georgia|journal=Art Papers|date=2004|volume=28.4|pages=42–43|ref=Art Full Text (H.W. Wilson)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1953 and 1957, Schapiro created a substantial body of work in which she focused on the dominant style of the period: Abstract Expressionism. Miriam created her own gestural language: "painting thinly and wiping out", in which the wiped area played a significant role as the painted area. Although these works were abstracted such as her work Beast Land and Plenty, Schapiro based them off of black and white illustrations of works by the "old masters". In December 1957, [[André Emmerich]] selected one of her paintings for the opening of his gallery.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Early in her career, Schapiro started looking for maternal symbols to unify her own roles as a woman. Her series, ''Shrines'' was created in 1961-63 with this in mind. Beginning in 1960 Schapiro began to eliminate abstract expressionist brushwork from her paintings and began to introduce a variety of geometric forms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is one of her earliest group of work that was also an autobiography. Each section of the work show an aspect of being a woman artist. They are also symbolic of her body and soul. The play between the illusion of depth and the acceptance of the surface became the main formal strategy of Miriam's work for the rest of the decade.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Miriam Schapiro Works on Paper a Thirty Year Retrospective|last=Yassin|first=Robert|publisher=Tucson Museum of Art|year=1999|isbn=|location=Tucson, Arizona|pages=7–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shrines enabled Schapiro to discover the multiple and fragmented aspects of herself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1964 Schapiro and her husband Paul both worked at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop. One of Schapiro's biggest turning points in her art career was working at the workshop and experimenting with [[Josef Albers]]' Color-Aid paper, where she began making several new shrines and created her first collages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1967, Schapiro and Brach moved to [[California]] so that both could teach in the art department at the University of California, San Diego. There Miriam met her close friend David Nalibof, a physicist who worked for General Dynamics. Nalibof formulated computer programs that could plot and alter Miriam Schapiro's drawings. This was how her first feminist work, ''Big Ox #1'' from 1968 was created. The diagonals of which represented the limbs of the "Vitruvian man," while the O depicted the center of the women, the vagina, the womb. This work is described as "a newly invented, body-based, archetypal emblem for female power and identity, realized in brilliant red-orange, silver, and 'tender shades of pink'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/684924?mobileUi=0&amp;journalCode=amart|title=Miriam Schapiro (1923-2015)|last=Braude|first=Norma|date=2015|website=The University of Chicago Press|access-date=|doi=10.1086/684924|volume=29|pages=132–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The O is also thought to symbolize the egg, which exists as the window into the maternal structure with outstretched limbs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Subsequently, she was able to establish the Feminist Art Program at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], in Valencia with [[Judy Chicago]]. The program set out to address the problems in the arts from an institutional position and focused on the expansion of a female environment in Downtown, L.A. In ''[[Womanhouse]]'' women were able to turn their invested creativity in rewarding their families with supportive environments toward themselves by allowing their fantasies to take over all rooms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They wanted the creation of art to be less of a private, introspective adventure and more of a public process through consciousness raising sessions, personal confessions and technical training.&lt;ref&gt;Arnason, H.H.; Mansfield, E.C.  History of Modern Art. Prentice Hall. 2010. pp604.  {{ISBN|0-205-67367-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; "('House') became the repository of female fantasy and womanly dreams". Schapiro participated in the ''[[Womanhouse]]'' exhibition in 1972. Schapiro's smaller piece within ''Womanhouse'', called "[[Dollhouse]]", was constructed using various scrap pieces to create all the furniture and accessories in the house.  Each room signified a particular role a woman plays in society and depicted the conflicts between them.&lt;ref&gt;3.	Schapiro, Miriam.  The Education of Women as Artists: Project Womanhouse.  Art Journal 31.3 (1972) :  268-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schapiro's work from the 1970s onwards consists primarily of [[collage]]s assembled from fabrics, which she called "femmages". In the early seventies, succeeding Schapiro’s collaboration in ''Womanhouse'', she made her first fabric collages in her studio in Los Angeles, which looked much like a room in a house. From the male technological world of computers Schapiro moved into a woman’s decorated house. In this home-like studio, Schapiro monumentalized her fabric cabinet and its significance for women, in a number of large femmages, including ''A Cabinet for All Seasons''. This was her poetic version of the representation of continuous changes and repetitions in all women’s bodies and lives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In her definition of femmage, Schapiro wrote that the style, which simultaneously recalls quilting and Cubism, has a "woman-life context" and that it "celebrates a private or public event." As Schapiro traveled the United States giving lectures, she would ask the women she met for a souvenir.  These souvenirs would be used in her collage like paintings. Schapiro also did collaborative art projects, like her series of etchings ''Anonymous was a Woman'' from 1977. She was able to produce the series with a group of nine women studio-art graduates from the University of Oregon. Each print is an impression made from an untransformed doily that was placed in soft ground on a zinc plate, then etched and printed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Her 1977-1978 essay ''Waste Not Want Not: An Inquiry into What Women Saved and Assembled - FEMMAGE'' (written with [[Melissa Meyer]]) describes femmage as the activities of collage, [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], [[découpage]] and [[photomontage]] practised by women using "traditional women's techniques - sewing, piercing, hooking, cutting, appliquéing, cooking and the like..."&lt;ref&gt;Kristine Stiles, Peter Selz, ''Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings'', University of California Press, 1996, pp151-4. {{ISBN|0-520-20253-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1975, Schapiro returned to New York and with what she made after selling some paintings, she not only had a room but a studio of her own. Decoration and "collaboration," are central to her artwork and both play a significant role in her house as well as in her studio.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The studio became Schapiro’s own room and at moments of great personal conflict, the only connection with her creative self. Her various studios throughout the span of her career have reflected the changes in both the outer and the inner realities of her life. They have expressed her changing self-conceptions in accordance with or in against society, which keeps gender roles separate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Schapiro's studios have also become metaphors for her creative work, as well as spaces in which she could live her life and fulfill her dreams as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the process of taking on different projects, Schapiro’s studio expanded and eventually became portable, following her as she traveled from place to place. It was during the same time of her Oregon collaborative project with the nine women that Schapiro also created her first "Collaboration Series" with women artists of the past. This series combined reproductions of the work of Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot with colorful and sensuous fabric borders in patterns inspired by quilts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In ''Mary Cassatt and Me'', Schapiro overlapped her own mental image of her mother with Cassatt's maternal ideal–her mother reading a newspaper.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the 1990s Schapiro began exploring her Jewish identity further in her painting. Her painting ''My History'' (1997) she used the same structure as the ''House''  project and built rooms of different memories surrounding her Jewish heritage. Her most explicit Jewish-themed statement in art was ''Four Matriarchs'', stained glass windows portraying the biblical heroines Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah. This was a colorful piece combining identity symbology and her older domesticated art to create the true vision of what high art meant to the public. ''Mother Russia'' (1994), was a fan piece made by Schapiro that drew from her family's Russian background. She depicts the powerful women from Russia each on a row of the hand held fan with a hat and a veil. She added pieces from each artist work in her "collaborative" style to join them as revolutionary women and give hidden figures praise. Her background in both the Russian and Jewish culture have very much attributed to what Schapiro’s collection of work represents. The foundation and collective use of patterns and colors describe Miriam's work and allow us to see her culture and female voice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Mother Mary Angelica of the Annunciation''', [[Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration|PCPA]] (born '''Rita Antoinette Rizzo'''; April 20, 1923 – March 27, 2016), also known as '''Mother Angelica''', was a Catholic American [[Poor Clare]] [[nun]] best known for her television personality. She was also the founder of the internationally broadcast cable television network [[Eternal Word Television Network]] (EWTN) and the radio network [[WEWN]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/mother-angelica-dies-easter-sunday/|title=Mother Angelica dies on Easter Sunday|accessdate=March 28, 2016|work=The Washington Times | date = March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Mother Angelica started broadcasting religious programs from a converted garage in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Over the next twenty years, she developed a media network that included radio, TV, and internet channels as well as printed media.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2009, Mother Angelica was a recipient of the [[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]] Award granted by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] for services to the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/ewtn-celebrates-mother-angelicas-90th-birthday/|title=EWTN celebrates Mother Angelica's 90th birthday|website=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mother Angelica hosted shows on EWTN until she had a stroke in 2001. She continued to live in the [[cloistered]] monastery in [[Hanceville, Alabama]], until her death at age 92 on March 27, 2016 ([[Easter Sunday]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Early life ==
Mother Angelica was born Rita Antoinette Rizzo on April 20, 1923, in [[Canton, Ohio]], in a community of African-American and Italian immigrant mill workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1400|title=Mother Angelica Encyclopedia of Alabama|website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cantonrep.com/article/20101008/NEWS/310089826|title=Canton events celebrate Mother Angelica's life and ministry|last=Goshay|first=Charita|website=The Repository|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of [[Italian-American]] background, she was the only child of John and Mae Helen Rizzo ([[née]] Gianfrancesco). Her father, a tailor by trade, abandoned the family when Rizzo was only five,&lt;ref name=TelegraphOB&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother Angelica, television nun – obituary|date=March 29, 2016|publisher=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/03/29/mother-angelica-television-nun---obituary/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother Angelica: Obituaries – Franciscan nun and media entrepreneur who founded the largest Catholic television network in the US Eire Region|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1776294901/|accessdate=22 November 2016|publisher=News International Trading Limited.|date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arroyo 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; and her parents divorced two years later.&lt;ref name=TelegraphOB /&gt; On March 10, 1931, her mother was granted custody of the young Rizzo, and her father ordered to pay five dollars a week in child support.&lt;ref name="Arroyo 15"&gt;Arroyo 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother only received "intermittent child-support payments from the father".&lt;ref name=TelegraphOB /&gt;  While maintaining full custody, her mother struggled with chronic depression and poverty.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was in part because being a divorcée carried a social stigma at the time and the opportunities for a woman to secure income were limited especially in the height of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="Arroyo 15" /&gt;

Looking back at her childhood, Mother Angelica described herself and her mother as being "like a pair of refugees". "We were poor, hungry, and barely surviving on odd jobs until Mother joined the dry cleaning business as an apprentice to a Jewish tailor in our area. Even then, we pinched pennies just to keep food on the table."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://olamnuns.com/mother-angelica/biography.html|title=Biography|publisher=Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration: Our lady of the Angels Monastery|accessdate=April 4, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404080644/http://olamnuns.com/mother-angelica/biography.html|archivedate=April 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair lived with her maternal grandparents, moving out for a time between 1933 and 1937, but were forced to return because of financial pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Arroyo 15,19.&lt;/ref&gt; Matters were complicated when her grandfather, Anthony Gianfancesco, suffered a stroke in their absence, which paralyzed him on one side and required him to use a cane.&lt;ref&gt;Arroyo 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Rizzo attended a convent school, but disliked the nuns there, whom she recalled as being "the meanest people on earth" and treating her with harsh discipline due to her parents' divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Mother Angelica: Obituaries – Franciscan nun and media entrepreneur who founded the largest Catholic television network in the US [Eire Region] 2016, News International Trading Limited, London (UK).&lt;/ref&gt; She then attended [[Canton McKinley High School]], where she was one of the school's first drum [[Majorette (dancer)|majorettes]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She later told an interviewer, "I did very poorly in school. I wasn’t interested in the capital of Ohio. I was interested in whether my mother had committed suicide that day."&lt;ref name="TelegraphOB" /&gt; Rizzo developed no intimate friendships in high school, partly because of her fear that it would further upset her mother, who might see other demands for attention as a threat.&lt;ref&gt;Arroyo 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Rizzo never dated, recalling later, "I never had a date, never wanted one. I just didn't have any desire. I suppose having experienced the worst of married life, it was not at all attractive to me."&lt;ref&gt;Arroyo 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Rizzo, feeling overwhelmed by crowd noise and school chatter, began to leave McKinley High in the afternoons. She was given calcium and nerve medication to treat what was deemed a nervous condition.&lt;ref&gt;Arroyo 20&lt;/ref&gt; When her mother's mental condition seemed to worsen, she made arrangements with her grandparents to have her sent to Philadelphia to be with a relative.&lt;ref&gt;Arroyo 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adulthood ==
A stomach ailment that Rizzo had from 1939 continued to cause severe abdominal pain, despite the extensive medical treatment she received. Her mother took her to [[Rhoda Wise]] who was hailed as a mystic and stigmatic and "who claimed to receive visions of St [[Thérèse of Lisieux]]."&lt;ref name=TelegraphOB /&gt; Wise instructed Rizzo to perform a [[novena]] (a nine-day course of prayers) and made the girl promise that she would spread devotion to the saint if she was cured."&lt;ref name=TelegraphOB /&gt;

On the novena’s final day, January 18, 1943, Rizzo declared that she woke up with no pain and the abdominal lump causing it had vanished.&lt;ref name=TelegraphOB /&gt; This experience profoundly touched her; she believed that God had performed a [[miracle]] and she traced her lifelong commitment to God to this event.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Arroyo, ''Mother Angelica''. Image, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/us/mother-mary-angelica-who-founded-catholic-tv-network-dies-at-92.html|title=Mother Mary Angelica, Who Founded Catholic TV Network, Dies at 92|last=Vitello|first=Paul|date=2016-03-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later told an interviewer "[at that point] I knew that God knew me and loved me and was interested in me. All I wanted to do after my healing was give myself to Jesus."&lt;ref name=TelegraphOB /&gt;

One evening in 1944, Rizzo stopped at a church to pray and felt that God was calling her to be a [[nun]]. She sought guidance from a local parish priest who encouraged her to begin visiting convents. Her first visit was to the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], but the active congregation felt that she was better suited to contemplative life. She also visited Saint Paul's Shrine of Perpetual Adoration, a facility operated by an order of [[cloister]]ed contemplative nuns, located in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. When visiting this order, she felt as if she were at home. The order accepted her as a postulant, asking her to enter{{which|date=March 2017}} on August 15, 1944. She was 21 years old.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/03/27/mother-angelica-founder-ewtn-dead-at-92.html|title=Mother Angelica, founder of EWTN, dead at 92 Fox News|date=March 27, 2016|website=Fox News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 1945, Rizzo was vested as a [[Poor Clare]] nun. She received a new name, which her mother had chosen for her,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and title, "Sister Mary Angelica of the Annunciation".&lt;ref name="Alabama"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1400 Wallace, W. Jason. "Mother Angelica", ''Encyclopedia of Alabama'']&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, the Cleveland monastery established a new monastery in her home town of Canton and she moved there.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 1946, as a young nun, Sister Angelica had an accident with an industrial [[Floor buffer|floor-scrubbing machine]] that knocked her over and injured her spine, causing her ongoing pain and requiring her to wear leg braces for most of her life.&lt;ref name=Greg&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother Angelica's last days: priest describes her suffering, death on Easter|author=Greg Garrison|date=March 29, 2016|publisher=Alabama Media Group|url=http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2016/03/mother_angelicas_last_days_pri.html#comments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greg3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Air&gt;{{cite news|date=January 14, 2001|author=Tim Drake|title=Mother Angelica: She Left Hell and Took to the Air|publisher=National Catholic Register|url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/she_left_hell_and_took_to_the_air/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sister Angelica saw the occurrence as a divine sign and promised Jesus to build a new monastery deep in the Protestant-dominated [[Southern United States]] if she recovered.&lt;ref name=TelegraphOB /&gt;

On January 2, 1953, she made her solemn profession of vows at Sancta Clara Monastery in Ohio.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Our Lady of the Angels ===
While at Sancta Clara, Sister Angelica was inspired to create a religious community which would appeal to African Americans in the southern states and began to seek support. In 1957, Archbishop [[Thomas Joseph Toolen|Thomas Toolen]] suggested that she open this community in Birmingham. With a number of other Poor Clare nuns she worked to raise the necessary funds, partially from a small business venture making and selling fishing lures.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1961, the nuns bought a building and land, and in 1962, the community was officially established. It was named Our Lady of the Angels Monastery and located in [[Irondale, Alabama]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; although it was later relocated to the grounds of the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament ===
[[File:Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament.jpg|thumb|[[Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament]], [[Hanceville, Alabama|Hanceville]]]]
In 1999, Mother Angelica visited [[Colombia]] where she claimed to have a vision which told her to build a temple in honor of the Child Jesus.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Private donors contributed $48.6 million and she opened the [[Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament]] in Hanceville later the same year.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== EWTN ===
In 1962, Mother Angelica began a series of community meetings on matters relevant to Catholicism and also began recording her talks for sale. Bishop [[Joseph Gregory Vath|Joseph Vath]] noticed her talent for communicating with the lay public and encouraged her to continue; she began taping a radio show for broadcast on Sunday mornings and published her first book in 1972.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the late 1970s she began videotaping her talks for television, which were broadcast on the satellite [[Christian Broadcasting Network]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 1981, after visiting a Chicago television studio and being impressed by its capability, she formed the non-profit [[EWTN]] corporation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Initially, she recorded her shows in a converted garage at the monastery's property.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

EWTN became a voice for American conservative and traditional Catholics, with its position on religious and social issues often mirroring that of [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/06/entertainment/et-tvpope6 |title= Catholic view of pope’s death |publisher= ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |date= April 6, 2005 | first=Jay | last=Reeves}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emphasis on tradition, Angelica had feuds with some members of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Most famous is the feud over a pastoral letter written by Cardinal [[Roger Mahony]] of the [[Archdiocese of Los Angeles]] over teachings surrounding the [[Eucharist]] and the [[liturgy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.losangelesmission.com/ed/articles/1998/0198ms2.htm |publisher = Los Angeles Lay Catholic Mission |date = January 1998 |title = Sidebar: Mother Angelica On Mahony |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928234535/http://www.losangelesmission.com/ed/articles/1998/0198ms2.htm |archivedate = 2007-09-28 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After this dispute, EWTN added a theology department with priests, theologians, deacons, and lay people to make sure EWTN was in line with the teachings of the [[magisterium]] of the Roman Catholic Church.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

According to EWTN, the network's channels currently reach 264 million households globally.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/03/mother-mary-angelica-ewtn-obituary-1201727704/|title=Mother Mary Angelica Dies; Religious Network Star &amp; Founder Was 92|last=Evans|first=Greg|website=Deadline|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WEWN ===
On December 28, 1992, Mother Angelica launched a radio network, [[WEWN]], which is carried by 215 stations, as well as on shortwave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/a-signal-for-the-new-evangelization/|title=A Signal for the New Evangelization|website=National Catholic Register|accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years ==

Mother Angelica stepped down from control of EWTN in 2000 and handed control to a board of lay people. In 2001 she had one of several [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref name="cna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/ewtn-celebrates-mother-angelicas-90th-birthday/|title=EWTN celebrates Mother Angelica's 90th birthday|work=Catholic News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was left with "slightly slurred speech, some unresponsive facial muscles and the need to wear an eye patch over one eye because she was unable to close the eyelid."&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/mother-angelica-pleads-for-purging-of-other-terrorism-in-us|title=Mother Angelica Pleads for Purging of "Other" Terrorism in U.S.|date=October 1, 2001|publisher=LifeSite Daily News|author=Dr. Brian Kopp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Mother Angelica made a statement expressing sympathy for the victims, praising [[George W. Bush|President Bush]]'s speech to the U.S. Congress and calling for justice on the conspirators. She went on identifying "pornography, abortion, child prostitution, the spread of drugs, the destruction of youth by an immoral media and the suppression of religious expression in public places as 'other' terrorist threats that must be addressed."&lt;ref name="Kopp" /&gt; She condemned abortion saying it had  "deprived the nation of millions of people who would otherwise be there to defend the nation."&lt;ref name="Kopp" /&gt;

== Illness and death ==
Mother Angelica returned to taping her show twice a week on September 25, 2001. On Christmas Eve, she suffered another stroke and underwent a [[Embolectomy|thrombectomy]] to remove a blood clot, a procedure that resulted in improvement of her vision. The stroke caused partial paralysis of the right side of her body and affected her speech. She began speech therapy and stopped hosting television programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/general/press/mother_0115.htm|date=January 15, 2002|title=Doctors Say Mother Angelica Shows Remarkable Improvement and will be Moved out of Intensive Care Tomorrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; As her health declined, fellow nuns in Hanceville began providing her with constant care.&lt;ref name=Ivana /&gt;

On October 4, 2009, Mother Angelica and Deacon [[Bill Steltemeier]], then chairman of EWTN's board of governors, received the papal medal ([[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]]) from [[Pope Benedict XVI]] for their distinguished service to the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="cna" /&gt; Because of her ill health, Mother Angelica received the award in her room.&lt;ref name=CNS&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother Angelica, founder of EWTN, dies after long illness|publisher=Catholic News Service|date=March 28, 2016|url=http://www.themichigancatholic.org/2016/03/mother-angelica-foundress-ewtn-dies-long-illness/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328233616/http://www.themichigancatholic.org/2016/03/mother-angelica-foundress-ewtn-dies-long-illness/|archivedate=March 28, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop [[Robert J. Baker]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Birmingham in Alabama|Diocese of Birmingham]] conferred the papal awards. At a public ceremony he said: "Mother Angelica’s effort has been at the vanguard of the [[Evangelii nuntiandi|new evangelization]] and has had a great impact on our world."&lt;ref name=CNS /&gt;

In early December 2015, Mother Angelica was placed on a feeding tube. A representative for her order explained, "It's not that she's completely unable to eat. It's assisting her to get the nutrients she needs." He added that she had experienced "some up and downs the last few months. She's a fighter." Although confined to her bed, a representative said that "She's able to communicate with a squeeze of a hand, make gestures with her eyes. She acknowledges people when they're there. The nuns say she does sleep a lot."&lt;ref name=Greg3&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Alabama Media Group|url=http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2016/02/pope_francis_to_mother_angelic.html|author=Greg Garrison|date=February 12, 2016|title=Pope Francis to Mother Angelica: 'Pray for me'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tube&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother Angelica remains on feeding tube, confined to bed at monastery|publisher=National Catholic Reporter|url=http://ncronline.org/news/people/mother-angelica-remains-feeding-tube-confined-bed-monastery|date=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a feeding tube was in accord with the wishes she made before her stroke in 2001 – a reporter recalled her saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We don't understand the awesomeness of living even one more day... I told my sisters the other day, 'When I get really bad give me all the medicine I can take, all the tubes you can stuff down me. ... I want to live. ... Because I will have suffered one more day for the love of God ... I will exercise you in virtue. But most of all I will know God better. You cannot measure the value of one new thought about God in your own life.'"&lt;ref name=Ivana&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother Angelica, founder of EWTN, dies on Easter Sunday|publisher=Alabama Media Group|url=http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/03/mother_angelica_founder_of_ewt.html|author=Ivana Hrynkiw|date=March 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In early February 2016 [[Pope Francis]], while en route to Cuba, recorded a message for Mother Angelica, saying: "To Mother Angelica with my blessing and I ask you to pray for me; I need it. God bless you Mother Angelica."&lt;ref name=Greg3 /&gt; Near the end of that month, her fellow nuns at Our Lady of Angels Monastery called for prayers on her behalf saying that "Mother's condition remains delicate and she receives devoted care day and night by her sisters and nurses. In God's Providence, she was able to receive the special Jubilee grace of passing through the Holy Door shortly after its opening. Although she is most often sleeping, from time to time Mother will give a radiant smile. ... Mother herself is regularly fortified by the sacraments. Please continue to keep her in your prayers; each day is a gift!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Greg Garrison|date=February 23, 2016|url=http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2016/02/ewtn_founder_mother_angelica_r.html|title=EWTN founder Mother Angelica remains in 'delicate' condition|publisher=Alabama Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mother Angelica remained living at the monastery until her death on March 27, 2016 (Easter Sunday) at the age of 92 from complications due to the stroke she had 14 years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://churchpop.com/2016/03/27/mother-angelica-dies/|title=Mother Angelica Dies on Easter Sunday at 92|last=Make holy all the things!|first=|website=ChurchPOP|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, she "also suffered from [[Bell's palsy]], heart disease and asthma."&lt;ref name=Greg /&gt;

Mother Angelica held the Catholic belief in [[Redemptive suffering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/mother-angelica-offered-up-her-painful-death-as-a-love-gift-to-god|title=Mother Angelica’s passion: How the EWTN foundress embraced suffering in her final days as a gift to God|author=Pete Baklinski|date=March 30, 2016|publisher=Lifesite News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excerpts from Healing Power of Suffering|author=Mother M. Angelica|publisher=EWTN|url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/mother/ma11e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; the belief human suffering can become meritorious if offered to [[Jesus Christ]] and mystically united with His suffering. Because of this belief, in her period of declining health Mother Angelica "instructed her nuns to do everything to keep her alive, no matter how much she suffered, because every day she suffered, she suffered for God." She wanted every day to be "one more act of suffering to God."&lt;ref name=Greg /&gt; EWTN chaplain, Father Joseph Mary Wolfe, [[Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word|MFVA]] told reporters that Mother Angelica's desire to unite with Jesus in suffering was fulfilled when she "went into her death throes on Good Friday".&lt;ref name=Greg /&gt;

Father Wolfe recalled that "Mother began to cry out early in the morning from the pain that she was having. She had a fracture in her bones because of the length of time she had been bedridden. They said you could hear it down the hallways, that she was crying out on Good Friday from what she was going through. These two people [a caregiver and one of the sisters of her order] said to me she has excruciating pain."&lt;ref name=Greg /&gt; Wolfe said that "After the 3 o'clock hour arrived on Good Friday she was more calm, she was more peaceful."&lt;ref name=Greg /&gt; He also said that by the following day he made a point of putting himself in a position where her open eyes might focus on him and thanked her for the witness of her faith and "teaching us how to love Jesus more".&lt;ref name=Greg /&gt; By 5:30 am on [[Easter Sunday]], Wolfe was contacted by Mother Delores who told him that Mother Angelica "was really struggling, she wasn't doing very well."&lt;ref name=Greg /&gt; Wolfe went to her bedside to administer the Catholic [[last rites]] with the sisters of her order in attendance. The sisters prayed their morning prayers, the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]], around her bed. As it was Easter, the prayer was liturgically required to contain [[Alleluia]]s, which are usually not contained in the office for the dead – a fact that Wolfe felt had significance. Around 10:30 am, Father Paschal offered [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] in her room and she received her last communion ([[Viaticum]]). Priests and nuns continued to pray around her bed into the afternoon. She took her last breath shortly before 5:00 pm, and died.&lt;ref name=Greg /&gt;

=== Tributes ===
Mother Angelica's death was announced by EWTN.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In a statement on EWTN's Facebook page, Father Sean O. Sheridan, president of the [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]] where Mother Angelica received an [[honorary doctorate]] of sacred theology, described her as "a true media giant. She proved that the Church belonged in the popular media alongside the news, sports, and talk shows. Though her stances were decidedly old-school — she was critical of religious and political progressives — her lectures were lightened with an often self-deprecating humor. She famously said the nuns she remembered from her youth were "the meanest people on God’s earth."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In a ceremony on March 29, 2016, Mother Angelica's body was brought to the Our Lady of the Angels Monastery for private visitation by the Poor Clare nuns. Public visitation occurred at the upper church of the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament on March 30–31. The [[Requiem|Mass of Christian Burial]] at the shrine's upper church took place on April 1 with [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Archbishop of Philadelphia]] and EWTN board member [[Charles Joseph Chaput|Charles J. Chaput]], [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|O.F.M. Cap.]], serving as principal celebrant and EWTN chaplain Father Joseph Mary Wolfe, MFVA, as the [[homily|homilist]]. [[Robert Joseph Baker|Robert J. Baker]] and [[David Edward Foley|David E. Foley]], the current and emeritus [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Birmingham in Alabama|Bishops of Birmingham]] (where both EWTN and Our Lady of the Angels Monastery are  located), respectively, concelebrated the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]], along with Archbishop [[Thomas J. Rodi]] of [[Archdiocese of Mobile|Mobile]] (whose [[metropolitan bishop|ecclesiastical province]] includes the Diocese of Birmingham), Bishop [[Thomas J. Olmsted]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix|Phoenix]], Bishop [[Richard Stika|Richard F. Stika]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Knoxville|Knoxville]] and  Archbishop [[Carlo Maria Vigano]], the [[Apostolic Nunciature to the United States|Apostolic Nuncio to the United States]]. In addition, many priests, deacons, religious, and seminarians were in attendance. This was followed by the [[Christian burial#Catholic burial ritual|Rite of Committal]] at the shrine's crypt chapel.&lt;ref name=Greg2 /&gt; All the funeral rites were televised on EWTN.&lt;ref name=Greg2&gt;{{cite news|author=Greg Garrison|publisher=Alabama Media Group|url=http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2016/03/mother_angelica_will_be_buried.html|title=Mother Angelica will be buried Friday at her Alabama monastery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Joel Mathins|publisher=Philadelphia Magazene|url=http://www.phillymag.com/news/2016/03/30/chaput-mother-angelica-funeral/|title=Chaput to Officiate at Mother Angelica Funeral}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called for her to be proclaimed a saint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/03/28/calls-for-canonisation-as-ewtn-founder-mother-angelica-dies-aged-92/|title=Calls for canonisation as EWTN founder Mother Angelica dies aged 92 {{!}} CatholicHerald.co.uk|date=2016-03-28|newspaper=CatholicHerald.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[exonym]] "Mun" derives from the traditional belief in spirits called ''mun'' or ''mung''. Together with ''bongthing'' (also ''bungthing'' or ''bóngthíng''), ''mun'' comprise a central element in the religion. These terms are also used to describe the shaman priesthood that officiates the respective spirits.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nebesky&gt;{{cite book|title=Tibetan Religious Dances: Tibetan Text and Annotated Translation of the ʼChams Yig |volume=2 |series=Religion and Society |first=René |last=de Nebesky-Wojkowitz |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1976 |isbn=902797621X |page=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pIHbKCpj9HEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mun religion and its priesthood are in decline.&lt;ref name=Das&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lepchas of West Bengal |first=Amal Kumar |last=Das |publisher=Editions Indian |year=1978 |pages=12, 193–97 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9MtAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion to other religions is attributed to economic pressure, as traditional practices are immensely expensive to the ordinary practitioner.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt; It has, however, regained interest among Lepcha as ecological encroachment becomes a growing concern.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt; The environment is so deeply intertwined with Mun beliefs that religious leaders have offered direct opposition to development in areas including the [[Rathong Glacier|Rathong Chu]] and [[Teesta River]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Independent People's Tribunal on Dams, Environment and Displacement |chapter=Sanctity, Environment, and Protest: A Lepcha Tale |first=Kery |last=Little |editor=Doma T Bhutia |publisher=Socio Legal Information Cent |year=2012 |isbn=8189479814 |pages=84–93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXpyQN_e2eoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
The traditional Lepcha belief system is rich in oral [[myth]]s, [[legend]]s, [[fable]]s, and [[fairy-tale]]s collectively called ''lúngten sung''.&lt;ref name=Plaisier&gt;{{cite book|title=Languages of the Greater Himalayan Region. A Grammar of Lepcha |volume=5 |series=Languages of the Greater Himalayan region |first=Heleen |last=Plaisier |publisher=Brill |year=2007 |isbn=9004155252 |pages=4, 15 (photo) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpCXEc_9RWcC&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mun mythology, the ancestors of the Lepcha were created by Itbu Rum, who molded them from the pure snows of mount [[Kangchenjunga]]. They thus share a lineage with the natural environment and share the cosmos with non-human spirits.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;

The spirit of the legendary [[Thekong Thek]] delivers reproaches to the Lepcha chief through ''mun'' or ''bongthing'' shamans.&lt;ref name=Nebesky/&gt;

==Belief system==
The belief system of Mun is animist, and the natural environment provides much of its basis. Naturally occurring spirits are an object of ceremonial dedication, and they reside in objects such as trees, rocks, and rivers. It is also a [[syncretism|syncretic]] religion that has coexisted with [[Mahayana Buddhism]] since its arrival in the seventh century, with practitioners following both religions at the same time. Traditional beliefs may have influenced Lepcha Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;&lt;ref name=West/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plaisier/&gt; Modern religious life in a Lepcha village is centered on the ''gumpa'', or [[Buddhist monastery]].&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;

Many Lepcha were converted to [[Christianity]] by [[Scotland|Scottish]] missionaries in the 19th century, however Buddhism and the traditional religion have retained important roles in Lepcha religious life. Many Christian Lepcha who have lost their [[Lepcha language]] have also distanced themselves from these traditional aspects of Lepcha religion.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plaisier/&gt;

Mun religion includes a belief in heaven, called ''rumlyang''.

===Deities===
The Mun religion is [[polytheistic]] and [[syncretic]]: it acknowledges several deities, including those of other religions, namely [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of the Himalayas: Bhutan Himalayas |volume=2 |first=Ramesh Chandra |last=Bisht |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=8183242650 |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWblUfYqGK4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief goddess of the Lepcha religion is Nozyongnyu.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt; The mother-creator is a female earth deity, It Bunoo (also Itbu-moo).&lt;ref name=West/&gt;&lt;ref name=NEI/&gt; Two other female deities are the chief of the ''mun'' spirits.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;

Traditional Lepcha beliefs include deities governing family, clan (or lineage, ''putsho''), village, region, and wider levels. Clan deities may be named after mountain peaks or rivers, while regions are home to deities associated with Kangchenjunga such as ''Chyu-rum-fat''. The traditional religion also incorporates [[Buddha]] and [[Jesus Christ]] as a deities, depending on household beliefs.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;

===Mun spirits===
''Mun'' spirits are of two general types: the benevolent, or [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|white magic]]ian, ''taung-li mun'', and the malevolent, or [[black magic]]ian, ''mung-sek mun'' or ''mung''.&lt;ref name=NEI&gt;{{cite book|title=Sikkim |volume=10 |series=Discovery of North-East India: Geography, History, Culture, Religion, Politics, Sociology, Science, Education and Economy |editors=Suresh Kant Sharma, Usha Sharma |publisher=Mittal Publications |year=2005 |isbn=8183240445 |pages=325, 326, 329, 332 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBk3xBjSRbsC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter reside in trees, bushes, rocks, and rivers.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt; The spirits are further subdivided into seven classes: ''avor mun'', ''pildon mun'', ''angan mun'', ''tungli mun'', ''munjyum mun'', ''mun mook mun'' and ''lyang-eet mun''. ''Mun'' spirits, and witchcraft, are believed to be the invariable culprit of illness.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;

==Rituals==
Ceremonies are usually performed for one or several households, and consist of two parts. The ''rum'' portion is an offering to devils. The second, ''tsandong'', is for offerings to the deity Kangchenjunga, to ''Chyu rum fat'', and to the plains. Ceremonies generally seek to appease these spirits.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt; ''Bongthing'' rituals generally include prayers, herbs, and amulets, and may also include directed breathing or spitting by the priest. Ritual prayers are sometimes in the form of [[glossolalia]].&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;&lt;ref name=NEI/&gt;

[[Spirit possession]] occurs in a variety of manners: from a subtle headache to violent, uncontrollable madness. Generally symptoms are the manifestation of ''mung'' spirits feeding off the flesh, blood, internal organs, or life energy of the host.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt; Ritual paraphernalia include the ''ghanta'' bell, ''damaru dru'' necklaces, and consecrated cup filled with ''chi''.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;

The religion practices [[animal sacrifice]], especially of goats and pigs.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref name=West/&gt;&lt;ref name=Das/&gt;

Mun priests are traditionally present at Lepcha celebrations for birth, marriage, and death. Among the Lepcha, Mun officiants are the only obligatory aspect of a commoner's funeral. The funerary ceremony, called ''dek flee'', is accompanied by the sacrifice of a goat and a hen three days after death. It is also performed at the home of people who die elsewhere, for fear of the spirit's return.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tibetan Rituals of Death: Buddhist Funerary Practices |series=Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism |first=Margaret |last=Gouin |publisher=Routledge |year=2012 |isbn=1136959173 |page=253 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7i8Jv5RuPs4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auspicious locations and days, particularly in rural settings, may be required of rituals to address more severe ailments or threatening afflictions.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;

Festivals are also a central aspect of the religion.&lt;ref name=Plaisier/&gt;

==Priesthood==
The priesthood consists of two types of shaman, corresponding to the spirits they manifest. ''Mun'' undergo [[spirit possession]], manifesting supernatural entities bodily, can be male or female. While ''bongthing'' are only male, where they have to learn and practice rituals. It is said that Bongthing came before Mun, so as to show respect, the Mun needs to learn both the Bongthing way and the Mun way. Mun undergo [[spirit possession]], manifesting supernatural entities bodily. Their main functions are to ward off misfortunes and illness, perform [[exorcism]]s, and guide souls to the [[afterlife]]. Some also adjudicate [[theft]] cases. Although the priesthood exists, the religion considers true knowledge to be a divine [[revelation]] through [[meditation]] or dreams, as opposed to a learned talent.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;&lt;ref name=Worldmark/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plaisier/&gt;

Both the ''mun'' and ''bongthing'' priesthoods are hereditary, although they do not pass strictly patrilineally. Trained disciples of existing masters are often recruited to service at times of crisis as an election by ancestors or shamanic gods.&lt;ref name=Bareh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt; It is possible for a ''bongthing'' to advance to ''mun'' status.&lt;ref name=Plaisier/&gt;

''Padem'' are a male hereditary junior priesthood. A ''padem'' is usually an initiate on the path to becoming a ''mun'' shaman, and has the right to offer sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Himalayan Anthropology: The Indo-Tibetan Interface |series=World Anthropology |editor=James F. Fisher |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1978 |isbn=3110806495 |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8Eq6Obu6oYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional priesthood also plays a role in the indigenous medical system, as they learn therapeutic knowledge and healing rituals.&lt;ref name=Ferrari/&gt;

[[File:Panehesy’s EA.6 tomb (Kairoinfo4u).jpg|thumb|200px|Panehesy's EA6 Amarna tomb]]
The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] noble '''Panehesy'''  (also transcribed as '''Pinhasy'''&lt;ref name="Aldred"&gt;Aldred, Cyril, Akhenaten: King of Egypt ,Thames and Hudson, 1991 (paperback), {{ISBN|0-500-27621-8}}, pg 16,18,24,66,131,222&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Panehsy'''&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;Kemp, Barry, The City of Akhenaten and Nefertiti: Amarna and its People, Thames and Hudson, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;) was the 'Chief servitor of the [[Aten]] in the temple of Aten in [[Akhetaten]]' ('Second Prophet of the Lord of the Two Lands').

==Titles==
[[File:Aten temple, Panehsy's tomb.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Depiction of the temple of the [[Aten]] from Panehesy's tomb]]
Panehesy held a variety of titles that show how powerful he must have been during the [[Amarna Period]]. He was the 'Chief servitor of the Aten in the temple of Aten in Akhetaten' and 'Second Prophet of the Lord of the Two Lands'. He was also the 'Seal-bearer of Lower Egypt.'.&lt;ref&gt;Aayko Eyma, ed., ''A Delta-Man in Yebu: Occasional Volume of the Egyptologists' Electronic Forum No. 1'', p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

Panehsy was also the 'Superintendent of the Cattle of the Aten in Akhetaten' and the 'Superintendent of the Granary of the Aten'.&lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt;

==Houses==
[[File:Akenatón.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Detail of the stone shrine from the house of Panehesy adjacent to the Aten Temple]]
Panehesy had two houses in Amarna. One was located near the temple, while another was located in the Central City. The house near the temple was likely more of an office.&lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt;

The main residence of Panehesy (R44.2) lies in the Central City of Amarna.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Manchester Egyptian and Oriental Society'' by Manchester Egyptian and Oriental Society, Manchester University Press 1935, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; In his main residence a large shrine was discovered which depicted Akhenaten, [[Nefertiti]], and princess [[Meritaten]] making offerings to the Aten. This is an example of the domestic cult of the royal couple. The [[hypaethral]] chapel was located within the central hall. To the south of Panehesy's home was a small village. The total area occupied by the village is less than the area occupied by the main residence of the Priest. The village consists of some 40 houses that were likely the residences of Panehesy's staff.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, pp 44-45 including figure of the house and the village.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the vicinity of the home a stele was discovered depicting [[Amenhotep III]] and Queen [[Tiye]].&lt;ref name="Aldred"/&gt;

The second residence of Panehesy near the temple of the Aten may be related to his function as the overseer of the cattle. The structure includes stone floors and brick mangers and may have served as a holding pen for the cattle. Excavations revealed remains of cattle, horn and bones. The bones were the remains of the cattle butchered for the offerings in the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, pp 110-111&lt;/ref&gt; The central hall of this house held a stone built shrine painted to look like an Amarna Temple. The structure held narrow wooden doors and likely held a statue of the King. The shrine is now at the Cairo Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, pg 230, 232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tomb==
He had a tomb constructed at [[Amarna]], among the northern tombs among the [[Tombs of the Nobles (Amarna)|Tombs of the Nobles]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13902">{{About|five Sikh mens appointed by [[Guru Gobind Singh|Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji]]|the Sikh army community|Khalsa}}
'''Panj Pyare''' ({{lang-pa|ਪੰਜ ਪਿਆਰੇ}}, ''{{IAST|Pañj Pi'ārē}}'', literally the '''five beloved ones'''), is the name collectively given to the five Sikh men, [[Bhai Daya Singh|Bhai Dhaya Singh]], [[Bhai Dharam Singh]], [[Bhai Himmat Singh]], [[Bhai Mohkam Singh]] and [[Sahib Singh (Sikhism)|Bhai Sahib Singh]] by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] at the historic divan [[Anandpur Sahib]] on 14 April 1699. They formed the nucleus of the [[Khalsa]], as the first batch to receive [[khanda di Pahul]], i.e. rites of the two-edged sword.

{{Sikhism sidebar}}
In [[Sikh]] theology, as in the [[India]]n classical tradition generally, panj (ਪੰਜ) or paanch (पांच), i.e. the numeral five, has a special significance. [[Guru Nanak]] in [[Japji Sahib]] refers to five [[Sach Khand|khand]]s, i.e. stages or steps in spiritual development, and calls a spiritually awakened person a ''panch''. The ancient [[India]]n socio-political institution panchayat meant a council of five elders. Something like an inner council of five existed even in the time of the earlier Gurus: five Sikhs accompanied Guru Arjan on his last journey to Lahore; the five were each given 100 armed Sikhs to command by his successor, [[Guru Hargobind]]. [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] set out on his journey to Delhi to court execution attended by five Sikhs.

Until the [[Baisakhi]] of AD 1699, Sikh initiation ceremony, Charan Pahul, comprised the administering of charanamrit or charanodak to the novitiate.  As [[Bhai Gurdas]], Varan, I.23, records, this was the practice [[Guru Nanak Dev]] introduced for the Sikhs.  At the ceremony the novitiate quaffed water poured over the foot of the Guru and vowed to follow the religious and moral injunctions as well as the code of communal conduct laid down.  Later, masands or local leaders, specially authorized by the Gurus, also administered charan pahul.  According to Kesar Singh Chhibbar, Bansavalinama, a modification was introduced in the time of Guru Hargobind when water, poured over the toe of the right foot of each of the five chosen Sikhs assembled in a dharamsal, was received in a bowl and administered to the seekers after ardas or supplicatory prayer.

==The calling of 5 volunteers==
[[File:Keshgarh Sahib Gurudwara at Anandpur Sahib.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Keshgarh Sahib]] Gurudwara at [[Anandpur Sahib]], Punjab, the birthplace of [[Khalsa]]]]
Guru Gobind Singh, who had abolished the institution of masands replaced charan pahul with [[khanda di Pahul]].  He summoned a special assembly in the [[Keshgarh Fort]] at [[Anandpur Sahib|Anandpur]] on the [[Baisakhi]] day of 1756 Bk/30 March 1699.  After the morning devotions and [[kirtan]], he suddenly stood up, drawn sword in hand, and, to quote Bhai Santokh Singh, Sri Gur Pratap Suraj Granth, spoke: “The entire sangat is very dear to me; but is there a devoted Sikh who will give his head to me here and now?  A need has arisen at this moment which calls for a head.” A hush fell over the assembly.  Daya Ram , a shopkeeper of Lahore, arose and offered himself.  He walked behind the Guru to a tent near by. Guru Gobind Singh returned with his sword dripping blood and demanded another head. The Guru again asked for another head,  this time Dharam Singh from '''Hastinapur''' or modern Meerut, presented himself to the Guru. Guru Gobind Singh gave three more calls.  Mohkam Chand, a calico printer/tailor from Dwarka, Gujarat, Himmat Rai, a water-bearer from Jagannath Puri, Orissa, and Sahib Chand, a barber from Bidar, Karnataka stood up one after another and advanced to offer their heads. They were the first five Sikhs as understood in modern parlance.

==Guru Sahib emerges==

[[File:An inscription naming the five members of the Khalsa Panth, Takht Sri Keshgarh Sahib.jpg|thumb|200px|An inscription naming the five members of the [[Khalsa Panth]], at Takht [[Keshgarh Sahib]], the birthplace of [[Khalsa]] on [[Baisakh]] 1, 1756 [[Vikram Samvat]].]]

Guru Gobind Singh emerged from the tent '''“hand in hand with the five”''',  says Kuir Singh, Gurbilas Patshahi 10.  The disciples wore saffron-coloured raiment topped over with neatly tied turbans of the same colour. Guru Gobind Singh, similarly dressed, introduced his chosen Sikhs to the audience as Panj Pyare, the five devoted spirits beloved of the Guru.  He then proceeded to perform the ceremony.  Filling an iron bowl with clean water, he kept churning it with a [[khanda (sword)|khanda]], i.e. double-edged sword, while reciting over it the sacred verses.  Guru Gobind Singh’s wife Mata Sahib Kaur ji brought sugar crystals which were put into the vessel at the Guru’s bidding.  Sweetness was thus mingled with the alchemy of iron.  Amrit, the Nectar of Immortality, was now ready and Guru Gobind Singh gave the five Sikhs each five palmsful of it to drink.  At the end, all five of them quaffed from the steel bowl the remaining elixir binding themselves in new fraternal ties. Their rebirth into this brotherhood meant the cancellation of their previous family ties, of the occupations which had hitherto determined their place in society, of their beliefs and creeds and of the rituals they had so far observed.

The five Sikhs formed the nucleus of the self-abnegating, martial and casteless fellowship of the [[Khalsa]] Guru Gobind Singh had brought into being.  They were given the surname of [[Singh]], meaning lion, and were ever to wear the five emblems of the Khalsa — [[Kesh (Sikhism)|kesh]] or unshorn hair and beard; [[kangha]], a comb in the kesh to keep it tidy as against the recluses who kept it matted in token of their having renounced the world; [[Kara (Sikhism)|kara]], a iron bracelet; [[kaccha]], short breeches worn by soldiers; and [[kirpan]], a sword.  They were enjoined to succour the helpless and fight the oppressor, to have faith in One God and to consider all human beings equal, irrespective of caste and creed.

==The five different castes==

The episode of sis-bhet, i.e. offering of the heads was recorded by Bhai Kuir Singh in his Gurbilas Patshahi 10 (1751) followed by Bhai Sukkha Singh, Bhai Santokh Singh, and others.  Earlier chronicles such as the Sri Gur Sobha, and the Bansavalinama do not narrate it in such detail.  Ratan Singh Bhangu, Prachin Panth Prakash, simply says that "five Sikhs were selected, one each from the five castes, that they had received instruction at the hands of Guru Gobind Singh, was a devoted disciple and had been in residence at [[Anandpur Sahib|Anandpur]] long enough to have been affected by its ambience of faith and sacrifice.  As they volunteered individually it was a coincidence that they belonged to different castes and to different parts of India.

[[Khanda di Pahul]], introduced by Guru Gobind Singh on 30 March 1699, became the established form of initiation for [[Sikh]]s for all time to come; so also the institution of the Panj Pyare.  In fact, Guru Gobind Singh had himself been initiated by the Panj Pyare as he had initiated them.  Since then this has been the custom.  Panj Pyare, any five initiated Sikhs reputed to be strictly following the rahit, or [[Sikh]] discipline, are chosen to administer to the novitiates amrit, i.e. [[Khanda di Pahul]].  Panj Pyare are similarly chosen to perform other important ceremonies such as laying the cornerstone of a [[gurdwara]] building or inaugurating kar-[[Selfless service|seva]], i.e. cleansing by voluntary labour of a sacred tank, or leading a religious procession, and to decide issues confronting a local sangat or community as a whole.

At crucial moments of history, Panj Pyare have collectively acted as supreme authority, representing the Guru-Panth.  During the battle of [[Chamkaur]], it was the last five surviving [[Sikh]]s who, constituting themselves into the Council of Five, Panj Pyare, commanded Guru Gobind to leave the fortress and save himself to reassemble the [[Sikh]]s. Guru Gobind Singh had abolished the masand system and before he died, he also ended the line of living gurus.  In the institution of Panj Pyare, he had created the nucleus of a casteless and democratic continuing society.

==Story of Vasakhi==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
Gobind Rai was 33 years old when he had Divine inspiration to actuate his designs and make an undying legacy. Every year at the time of [[Baisakhi]] (springtime), thousands of devotees would come to [[Anandpur Sahib|Anandpur]] to pay their obeisance and seek the Guru's blessings. In early 1699, months before [[Baisakhi]] Day, Gobind Rai sent special edicts to congregants far and wide that that year the Baisakhi was going to be a unique affair. He asked them not to cut any of their hair—to come with unshorn hair under their turbans and chunis, and for the men to come with full beards.

On Baisakhi Day, March 30, 1699, hundreds of thousands of people gathered around his divine temporal seat at [[Anandpur Sahib]]. The Guru addressed the congregants with a most stirring oration on his divine mission of restoring their faith and preserving the [[Sikh]] religion. After his inspirational discourse, he flashed his unsheathed sword and said that every great deed was preceded by equally great sacrifice: He demanded one head for oblation. "I need a head", he declared. After some trepidation one person offered himself. The Guru took him inside a tent. A little later he reappeared with his sword dripping with blood, and asked for another head. One by one, four more earnest devotees offered their heads. Every time the Guru took a person inside the tent, he came out with a bloodied sword in his hand.

Thinking their Guru to have gone berserk, the congregants started to disperse. Then the Guru emerged with all five men dressed in orange suits with a blue bib.(These are the colors of Sikhism). He baptized the five in a new and unique ceremony called pahul, what Sikhs today know as the baptism ceremony called Amrit. Then the Guru asked those five baptized Sikhs to baptize him as well. This is how he became known as Guru Chela both teacher and student. He then proclaimed that the Panj Pyare—the Five Beloved Ones—would be the embodiment of the Guru himself: "Where there are Panj Pyare, there am I. When the Five meet, they are the holiest of the holy."

He said whenever and wherever five baptized (Amritdhari) [[Sikh]]s come together, the Guru would be present. All those who receive Amrit from five baptized Sikhs will be infused with the spirit of courage and strength to sacrifice. Thus with these principles he established Panth [[Khalsa]], the Order of the Pure Ones.

===Unique Identity===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
At the same time the Guru gave his new '''[[Khalsa]]''' a unique, indisputable, and distinct identity. The Guru gave the gift of bana, the distinctive Sikh clothing and headwear. He also offered five emblems of purity and courage. These symbols, worn by all baptized Sikhs of both sexes, are popularly known today as [[Five Ks]]: [[Kesh (Sikhism)|Kesh]], unshorn hair this a gift from god. [[Kangha]], the wooden comb it keeps the tangles out of Sikhs hair which shows that god keeps the tangles out of your life. [[Kara (Sikhism)|Kara]], the iron (or steel) bracelet which has no beginning or end which shows that god has no beginning or end. [[Kirpan]], the sword you only use it to defend others weaker than you. You don't hurt anyone. and [[Kashera]], the underwear worn by Sikhs in battle so they can move freely. By being identifiable, no Sikh could never hide behind cowardice again.

Political tyranny was not the only circumstance that was lowering people's morale. Discriminatory class distinctions (--the Indian "caste" system--) promoted by Hindu Brahmins were responsible for the people's sense of degradation. The Guru wanted to eliminate the anomalies caused by the caste system. The constitution of the Panj Pyare was the living example of his dream: both the high and low castes were amalgamated into one. Among the original Panj Pyare, there was one Khatri, shopkeeper; one Brahmin, priest; one Chhimba, calico printer/tailor; one Ghumar, water-carrier; and one Nai, a barber. Further the five were from distant regions - Sindh, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Gujarat and Karnataka.. He gave the surname of Singh (Lion) to every Sikh and also took the name for himself. From Gobind Rai he became Guru Gobind Singh. He also pronounced that all Sikh women embody royalty, and gave them the surname [[Kaur]] (Princess). With the distinct [[Khalsa]] identity and consciousness of purity Guru Gobind Singh gave all Sikhs the opportunity to live lives of courage, sacrifice, and equality.

The birth of the Khalsa is celebrated by [[Sikh]]s every Baisakhi Day on April 13. Baisakhi 1999 marks the 300th anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh's gift of [[Panth]] Khalsa to all [[Sikh]]s everywhere.

'''Ramtha's School of Enlightenment''' ('''RSE''') is an American [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[sect]] near the rural town of [[Yelm, Washington]], U.S. The school was established in 1988 by [[J. Z. Knight]], who claims to [[Mediumship|channel]] a 35,000-year-old being called Ramtha the Enlightened One. The school's teachings are based on these channeling sessions.

==History==
In 1988, [[J. Z. Knight]] founded Ramtha's School of Enlightenment (RSE), then called Ramtha's School of Enlightenment: The American Gnostic School, on her {{no wrap|{{convert|80|acres|adj=on}}}}&lt;ref name="olympian3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pemberton|first=Lisa|title=Behind the gates at Ramtha's School|url=http://www.theolympian.com/news/local/article25225543.html|newspaper=The Olympian|date=July 16, 2006|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; estate in [[Yelm, Washington]], U.S. A division of Knight's company JZK, Inc.,&lt;ref name="York2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=York|first=Michael|title=Historical Dictionary of New Age Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umbl7x8aYqkC&amp;pg=PA105|series=Historical Dictionaries of Religions, Philosophies, and Movements|volume=No. 49|year=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-4873-3|pages=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; the school had around 80 staff members {{as of|2014|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=SPLC/&gt; According to RSE's website, it is an "academy of the mind that offers retreats and workshops to people of all ages and cultures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Ramtha's School of Enlightenment|url=http://ramtha.com/content/aboutus.aspx|website=Ramtha's School of Enlightenment|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSE's private, fenced compounds are only open to staff members and students, not to the public.&lt;ref name="olympian2"/&gt;

In 2004, various Ramtha school leaders joined community groups to strongly oppose a proposed 75,000-seat NASCAR racetrack in Yelm. The proposal was withdrawn. In 2007, Knight's profits from the school's activities and from sale of books, tapes, CDs and DVDs had reportedly been around $2.6 million. In 2008, lessons were given to the public in more than 20 countries, including the [[Czech Republic]], [[Romania]] and [[Chile]] for the first time.&lt;ref name="olympian2"/&gt;

==Teachings==
{{see|JZ Knight#Teachings}}
[[File:2012-05-17 Yelm Ramtha School of Englightenment entrance.jpg|thumb|320px|Gate to Ramtha's School of Enlightenment northwest of [[Yelm, Washington]].]]

The school teaches that human beings have the capacity to utilize their inner wisdom, focus their brains, and create their own reality.&lt;ref name="olympian2"/&gt; The school's curriculum is based on the channelings by Knight of the entity Ramtha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Lydgate |title=What The #$*! is Ramtha?: The year's sleeper hit was inspired by a 35,000-year-old warrior spirit from Atlantis |url=http://wweek.com/story.php?story=5860 |work=Willamette Week|date=December 22, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309094737/http://www.wweek.com/story.php?story=5860|archivedate=March 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the school has been criticised for being a [[cult]] (see below), Knight and her followers deny such claims and say that the school is neither a [[religion]] nor a cult.&lt;ref name="whitebook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Judy Zebra|title=Ramtha: The White Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gz78a6_iDlAC&amp;pg=PA28|date=January 27, 2005|origyear=1999|publisher=JZK Publishing|location=Yelm, Washington|isbn=978-1-57873-045-2|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramtha.com/html/media/faqs/school/school-religion.stm|title=Media: Is it a school or a religion?|website=Ramtha's School of Englightenment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401080232/http://www.ramtha.com/html/media/faqs/school/school-religion.stm|archivedate=April 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramtha.com/html/aboutus/about-jz.stm|title=About Us: Greetings from JZ Knight|website=Ramtha's School of Englightenment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308043731/http://ramtha.com/html/aboutus/about-jz.stm|archivedate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramtha's School of Enlightenment teachings have been described as part of the [[New Age]] movement (the school itself claims to be outside it). A controversial religious scholar, [[J. Gordon Melton]], wrote a book countering this argument called ''Finding Enlightenment: Ramtha's School of Ancient Wisdom''.

Lessons in the school's compounds sometimes include wine drinking,&lt;ref name="cunningham"/&gt; tobacco pipe smoking and dancing to rock ’n’ roll music. Allegedly, it is being taught that the nitric oxide in red wine (not the alcohol), also found in pipe tobacco (not the nicotine), can help to facilitate changes in the brain as a part of the process in which to achieve these means.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Through various focus techniques, the students believe they are on their way to becoming as "enlightened" as other shamans who can alter their personal reality at will.&lt;ref name="szimhart"/&gt; The main activities towards that goal vary from specific focusing, meditation-like techniques, breathing techniques, blindfolded archery, energy healing (for one's self and for someone else), finding the heart of a maze, and many more.  The students are taught that human beings can train themselves into such powers that will allow them to levitate, raise the dead, make gold appear in their hand and predict the future. Eventually this may lead to the "ascension" of the physical body into the "light body".&lt;ref name="szimhart"/&gt;

Other skills allegedly obtained by attending the lessons include [[psychokinesis]], [[telepathy]], [[clairvoyance]], and other [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]] skills,&lt;ref name="remarkable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ramtha.com/Remarkable.html|title=Remarkable Students|website=Ramtha's School of Enlightenment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726130331/http://ramtha.com/Remarkable.html|archivedate=July 26, 2011}}{{primary-inline|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|date=February 2017}} which have been criticized by various skeptics around the world.

The dialogues, and a lot of transcripts from Knight's Ramtha talks, have been compiled and published over the course of many years. Videotapes of various dialogue sessions have also been released. While some of the major themes around the school's teachings are covered in these publications, a more in-depth and systematic presentation of its philosophies and teachings are only accessible by attending a retreat in person.

==Research==
In February 1997, Knight hosted a conference of scholars who had been studying her, the students and the school for the previous year. During their research phase, they also observed Knight's Ramtha sessions and measured various physiological functions of her body. The researchers examined Ramtha’s teachings and the school's practices from a variety of perspectives, including [[physics]], [[feminism]], [[parapsychology]] and religion. Melton organized the research. In addition to the conference presenters, Knight invited the media to attend. However, Knight said she did not sponsor the conference to gain publicity or to convince her skeptics.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news|author=Maynard, Steve|title=JZ Knight to Open Ranch to Scrutiny|department=Front Page|newspaper=The News Tribune|location=Tacoma, Washington|date=February 1, 1997|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Professors at Ramtha Meeting Defend Objectivity, Integrity|author=Maynard, Steve|department=Local/State|newspaper=The News Tribune|location=Tacoma, Washington|date=February 10, 1997|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight paid the travel expenses and [[stipend]]s for the conference presenters,&lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt; which caused some of Knight’s critics to suggest she had influenced their research. The researchers denied this contention to the press and, according to the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', "were offended by a suggestion that the New Age spiritualist could have tried to buy their support".&lt;ref name=SPLC&gt;{{cite news|author=Iwasaki, John|title=JZ Knight Not Faking It, Say Scholars – But They Bristle at the Idea She's Buying Them|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=February 10, 1997|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the conference proceedings, two papers were published. In 1998, [[Stanley Krippner]] published a paper on the [[psychological]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and geomagnetic results of the various studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krippner, Stanley; et al.|title=The Ramtha Phenomena: Psychological, Phenomenological, and Geomagnetic Data|journal=The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research|volume=92|issue=1|date=January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Joan Hageman published a paper examining the results of the physiological testing on Knight and six students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hageman, Joan H.; et al.|title=Sympathetic Reactivity During Meditation|journal=Subtle Energies &amp; Energy Medicine|volume=19|issue=2|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
{{see|JZ Knight#Controversy and criticism|JZ Knight#Court cases}}

Ramtha's School of Enlightenment has been called a cult by various people, including her former husband Jeff Knight,&lt;ref name="jeffknight"&gt;{{cite web|title=From Abracadabra to Zombies: Ramtha (a.k.a.

He has also been called a "cult apologist" by various opposers of cults. His position was further criticized when he took the stand as a witness in the case of Knight v. Knight (1992–1995) against Jeff Knight (JZ Knight's husband at the time), by further supporting that the school is not a cult.&lt;ref name="szimhart"&gt;{{citation|last=Szimhart|first=Joe|title=Critical Study of Gordon Melton's Book on Ramtha|work=Kelebek ''[''Butterfly'']''|date=July 1998|url=http://www.kelebekler.com/cesnur/txt/ram2.htm|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2012-05-17 Yelm Ramtha School of Enlightenment sign.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Sign along [[Washington State Route 510|WA 510]]. The entrance to Ramtha's School of Enlightenment is in the background on the left.]]

Former students of the school have accused the RSE of practicing brain-washing and mind-control, as well as using intimidation and fear techniques to keep students in the school. David McCarthy, a student of the RSE between 1989 and 1996, calls Knight a "spiritual predator", and he mentions various parts of the teachings which had an intimidative character, such as the prophecy that unless students remain faithful to Ramtha, they will become prey of the "lizard people", and that the ancient figure of [[Jehovah]] would return to earth accompanied by lizard people, in a spaceship.&lt;ref name="olympian2"/&gt; The former students (including David McCarthy and Joe Szimhart) have formed an online community, Life After RSE (LARSE), to provide support for people who have quit the school and find themselves lost.&lt;ref name="cunningham"/&gt;

A further controversial issue regarding the Ramtha teachings involve the so-called "days to come", which were prophesied earth changes. Instructions reputed as coming from Ramtha were given to the students, telling them to leave the cities, find a place in the country to grow their own food and become sovereign or self-sufficient. Another instruction was told to students to build underground shelters to protect themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="szimhart"/&gt;

Various incidents within the school's grounds have been characterized as controversial. Glen Cunningham, in an interview with David McCarthy, describes how, one evening, Knight suggested that all students should stay there overnight because she said it would be "good for the energy". That was before the Great Arena (formerly used as horse stables) had been floored, and as a result there would be a lot of dust in the air. Cunningham says that there was a very old woman among the students, who begged him that she did not want to do this and she wanted to go home, but Ramtha said that she can stay under the protection of Ramtha and her bodyguard. Leaving the arena the following day, the old woman died of pneumonia (due to the dust in the air and humidity).&lt;ref name="cunningham"/&gt;

Another incident which is mentioned by both Cunningham and Joe Szimhart is the practice of running blindfolded in a large fenced field. Szimhart mentions in particular an occasion around the year 1990, in which about 1,000 blindfolded students were directed to split up and run across the field, with their hands in the "Consciousness &amp; Energy" position in front of them, and the exercise was meant to help the students overcome their fears. Szimhart recalls how many people crashed into each other, and that there were some injuries. A customer of his ended up with a deeply bruised shoulder and a big lump on his forehead. Aside from the minor injuries, a few people had to be treated at the hospital.&lt;ref name="cunningham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="szimhart"/&gt;

In 2011, Knight stated (while at the RSE supposedly channeling Ramtha), "Fuck God’s chosen people! I think they have earned enough cash to have paid their way out of the goddamned gas chambers by now", and said that Mexican people "breed like rabbits" and are "poison," that all gay men used to be Catholic priests, and that organic farmers have bad hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan|first1=Susy|title=Ramtha Riled|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2014/ramtha-riled|accessdate=February 25, 2017|magazine=Intelligence Report|volume=2014 Summer Issue|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=May 23, 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alternet"&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchanan |first=Susy |url=http://www.alternet.org/belief/ramtha-new-age-cult-leader-unleashes-drunken-racist-homophobic-rants-large-following?paging=off&amp;current_page=1#bookmark |title=Ramtha, New Age Cult Leader, Unleashes Drunken, Racist, Homophobic Rants to Large Following |work=AlterNet |date=July 9, 2014|accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, videos of this were placed on the Internet by ex-students of Knight's and by the Freedom Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Austin|title=Washington Democrats Reverse Course, Shed JZ Knight Contributions|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=163750642|accessdate=February 25, 2017|work=NPR|date=October 27, 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brunner|first1=Jim|title=State Democratic Party Will Donate Money from JZ Knight after Offensive Comments|url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/politicsnorthwest/2012/10/26/state-democratic-party-will-donate-money-from-j-z-knight-after-offensive-comments/|accessdate=February 25, 2017|work=The Seattle Times|date=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alternet"/&gt;

In 2004, three members of the RSE produced a controversial film that combined documentary interviews and a fictional narrative to posit a connection between science and spirituality, called ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]''.

'''Rivers of Life''' (known as '''Ríos de Vida'''" [http://www.riosdevida.com/]" in Spanish) is a group of approximately eighty [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] churches around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=12 January 2008|title=Rivers of Life|url=http://riversoflife.org.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Rivers of Life" should be distinguished from "River of Life" of which there are several other churches and organisations around the world using this title in their church or organisations' name - most notably "River of Life International" which was founded in the U.K. in 1995 and now has churches, schools and orphanages in Africa and India including a Bible College in Kenya.

As regards "Rivers of Life" there are currently Churches in the following countries: United Kingdom, Spain, France, Netherlands, Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, Cuba, Panama and the United States.

As well as the churches previously mentioned, Rivers of Life has 4 [[#Bible Houses|Bible Colleges]], 2 Children's Homes, a School with approximately 600 students and an FM radio station (FM Victoria) amongst other ministries set up to serve the churches purposes and in turn to benefit the local community.

For Rivers of Life's 40th anniversary, the mayor of [[Quilmes]], Sergio Villordo visited the church in [[Quilmes]]; the first Rivers of Life church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=12 January 2008|date=17 October 2007|title=Villordo participó del Aniversario de la Iglesia Ríos de Vida|language=Spanish|url=http://villordo.wordpress.com/2007/10/17/villordo-participo-del-aniversario-de-la-iglesia-rios-de-vida/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mayor expressed his solidarity with Rivers of Life and praised the church for staying faithful to the city even though the church had now spread around the world.

== History ==
Rivers of Life was founded in 1967 in [[Quilmes]], a suburb of [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina by [[Jorge Pradas]] and Oscar Mirón both Spanish nationals along with others. Oscar Mirón had moved to Argentina to flee the persecution of [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians in Spain under [[Francisco Franco]]. He fled the country after he had been a target in an attempted assassination. When the church began, he opened up his workshop for church meetings to be held there. [[Jorge Pradas]] was the main leader of the church at the time.

The church in [[Quilmes]] now has approximately 1,000 members. By the 1970s, churches had been established in Europe.

==Beliefs==
Rivers of Life holds to the orthodox Christian faith. It is a free, [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] Church.

It practices believer's [[baptism]], [[Eucharist|the Lord's Supper]], the [[Spiritual gifts]] and the [[New Testament]] reality of Christ's Church.

It believes in Almighty God, [[trinity|Father, Son and Holy Spirit]]; in the full divinity, atoning death and bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.

It believes that the Bible is God’s authoritative Word fully inspired by the Holy Spirit.

Rivers of Life accepts and adheres to the universally accepted creeds of the Christian faith: the [[Apostles' Creed]], the [[Athanasian Creed]] and the [[Nicene Creed]]. (Where the word catholic is used in these creeds it means its dictionary definition of `universal` (i.e. Universal church).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=13 January 2008 |title=Rivers of Life Church Beliefs |url=http://www.riversoflife.co.uk/beliefs/beliefsmenu.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008042739/http://www.riversoflife.co.uk/beliefs/beliefsmenu.php |archivedate=8 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bible Houses==
[[Image:Casa Biblica.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bible House in [[Quilmes]], Buenos Aires, Argentina]]

Rivers of Life believe that as well as secular preparation for life, e.g., a university degree, Christians need to be prepared in other ways such as service, living in community and studying the Bible. For this reason Bible Houses were formed. Bible House is a [[bible college]] with the vision of preparing young people in areas mentioned above not just academically. The name "Bible House" highlights the fact that nearly all the students live in the same hall of residence. The standard course lasts for two years.

The following table give basic current information about Rivers of Life Bible Houses:

In [[Oxford]], UK there are two community houses but no Bible House.

All the Bible Houses are situated closed to a Rivers of Life Church and the students attend all the church services. The Bible House students also serve the church in every way possible.

[[Image:Martin van Maele - La Sorcière 06.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration by [[Martin van Maële]], of a ''[[Witches' Sabbath]]'', in the 1911 edition of ''La Sorcière'', by [[Jules Michelet]]]]
'''''Satanism and Witchcraft''''' (originally ''La Sorcière'') is a book by [[Jules Michelet]] on the history of [[witchcraft]] that was published originally in French in 1862.

==Publication==
The first English translation was published in [[London]] in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;''La Sorcière: The Witch of the Middle Ages'', translated by L. J. Teotter, "The only Authorized English Translation", London, 1863.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Views==
According to Michelet, medieval witchcraft was an act of popular rebellion against the oppression of [[feudalism]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. This rebellion took the form of a secret religion inspired by [[paganism]] and [[Faery|fairy]] beliefs, organized by a woman who became its leader. The participants in the secret religion met regularly at the [[Sabbath (witchcraft)|witches' sabbath]] and the [[Black Mass]]. Michelet's account is openly sympathetic to the sufferings of [[peasant]]s and women in the Middle Ages.

According to Michelet, in a note added to the end of the book:

{{quote|The object of my book was purely to give, not a history of Sorcery, but a simple and impressive formula of the Sorceress's way of life, which my learned predecessors darken by the very elaboration of their scientific methods and the excess of detail. My strong point is to start, not from the devil, from an empty conception, but from a living reality, the Sorceress, a warm, breathing reality, rich in results and possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Michelet, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Structure==
The first part of the book is an imaginative reconstruction of the experience of a series of witches who led the religion from its original form of social protest into decadence. The second part is a series of episodes in the European [[witch trial]]s. Today the book is regarded as being largely inaccurate, but still notable for being one of the first sympathetic histories of witchcraft, and as such it may have had an indirect influence on [[Wicca]].

==Media==
In the early 1970s, ''La Sorcière'' became the basis for the [[anime]] film ''[[Kanashimi no Belladonna]]'', by [[Mushi Production]].

The issue of '''[[slavery]]''' and '''[[religion]]''' is an area of historical research into the relationship between the world's major religions and the practice of slavery. Slavery could be a result of being a prisoner of war, owing a debt or being sold into slavery. Historically slavery has been supported by several major religions. A passage in the [[Bible]] has historically been interpreted by a subset of [[Christian]]s to mean that anyone with dark (black) skin also had a black soul, condemning them to slavery. Some Christians also enslaved non-believers as the "natural order of things" and saw any non-believer as a potential slave. Enslaved non-believers were sometimes converted to Christianity but elements of their traditional beliefs merged with their Christian beliefs. Some Popes since the 15th century denounced slavery, and various denominations were for or against slavery into the 19th century. In Judaism, slaves were given a range of treatments and protections. They were to be treated as extended family with certain protections and could be freed. They were property but could also own material goods. In Islam, under [[Sharia]] law, prisoners of war could be enslaved. Hindus encourage liberation as an ultimate goal, and their scriptures do not discuss slavery. However, [[Sanskrit]] language [[Hindu]] texts such as the ''[[Arthashastra]]'', and the [[Pali]] language [[Buddhist]] texts, contain the word ''dasa'', which is translated as either "servant" or "slave".

== Slavery in the Bible ==

{{main|The Bible and slavery}}

[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] narrative about the [[Curse of Ham]] has often been held to be an [[aetiology|aetiological]] story, giving a reason for the enslavement of the [[Canaanites]]. The word ''ham'' is very similar to the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for ''hot'', which is [[cognate]] with an [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word (''kem'', meaning ''[[black (hieroglyphic 'km')|black]]'') used to refer to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] itself, in reference to the fertile black soil along the [[Nile valley]]. Although many scholars therefore view ''Ham'' as an eponym used to represent Egypt in the [[Table of Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'' (1901), article on ''Ham''&lt;/ref&gt; a number of Christians throughout history, including [[Origen]]&lt;ref&gt;Origen, ''Homilies'', on Genesis 16:1&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cave of Treasures]],&lt;ref&gt;(edited by Ciala Kourcikidzé), ''The cave of treasures: Georgian version'', translated by [[Jean-Pierre Mahé]] in ''The written corpus of eastern Christianity'' 526-27, part of ''Scriptores Iberici'' 23-24 (Louvain, 1992-93), 21:38-39&lt;/ref&gt; have argued for the alternate proposition that ''Ham'' represents all [[black people]], his name symbolising their dark skin colour;&lt;ref&gt;Goldenberg, D. M. (2003). The Curse of Ham. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, page 141.&lt;/ref&gt; pro-slavery advocates, from [[Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria|Eutychius of Alexandria]]&lt;ref&gt;(edited by J.P. Migne), ''Complete course in Patrology…Greek series'', (Paris, 1857-66), on ''Annals'' 111:917B:41-43&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Philoponus]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Sanda, ''Opposcula Monophysitica Johannes Philoponi'' (Beirut, 1930), page 96&lt;/ref&gt; to American pro-slavery apologists,&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, S. R. (2002). Noah's Curse. New York: Oxford University Press, page 71.&lt;/ref&gt; have therefore occasionally interpreted the narrative as a condemnation of all black people to slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Felder, C. H. (2002). Race, Racism, and the Biblical Narratives. Minneapolis, Minnesota: Augsburg Fortress, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; A few Christians, like [[Jerome]], even took up the [[racism|racist notion]] that black people inherently had ''a soul as black as [their] body''.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Homilies'', 1:3:28&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery was customary in [[Ancient history|antiquity]], and it is condoned by the [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|22:2-3|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible uses the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''ebed'' to refer to slavery; however, ''ebed'' has a much wider meaning than the English term ''slavery'', and in several circumstances it is more accurately translated into English as ''servant''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (1901), article on ''Slaves and Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt; It was seen as legitimate to enslave captives obtained through warfare,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|20:10-16|}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not through kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|24:7|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|20:10-16|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children could also be sold into [[debt bondage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:44|}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was sometimes ordered by a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|22:2-3|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|4:1-7|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia 1901"&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'' (1901), article on ''Slaves and Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] Laws and the [[Code of Hammurabi]],&lt;ref&gt;''Peake's commentary on the Bible'' (1962), on Exodus 21:18-27&lt;/ref&gt; the Bible does set minimum rules for the conditions under which slaves were to be kept.

Israelite slaves were automatically manumitted after six years of work, and/or at the next [[Jubilee (Biblical)|Jubilee]] (occurring either every 49 or every 50 years, depending on interpretation), although the latter would not apply if the slave was owned by an Israelite and wasn't in debt bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:47-55|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves released automatically in their 7th year of service, which did not include female slaves,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:7|}}&lt;/ref&gt; or&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'' (1901), article on ''Law, Codification of''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Peake's commentary on the Bible'' (1962), on Exodus 21:2-11&lt;/ref&gt; did,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|15:12|}}&lt;/ref&gt; were to be given livestock, grain, and wine, as a parting gift&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|15:13-14|}}&lt;/ref&gt; (possibly hung round their necks&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia 1901"/&gt;). This 7th-year manumission could be voluntarily renounced, which would be signified, as in other Ancient Near Eastern nations,&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kelly Cheyne]] and John Sutherland Black, ''[[Encyclopaedia Biblica]]'' (1903), article on ''Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt; by the slave gaining a ritual [[ear piercing]];&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:5-6|}}&lt;/ref&gt; after such renunciation, the individual was enslaved ''forever'' (and not released at the Jubilee&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kelly Cheyne and John Sutherland Black, ''Encyclopaedia Biblica'' (1903), article on ''Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt;). Non-Israelite slaves were always to be enslaved ''forever'', and treated as inheritable property.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:44-46|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several [[Pauline epistles]], and the [[First Epistle of Peter]], slaves are admonished to obey their masters, ''as to the Lord, and not to men'';&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ephesians|6:5-8|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Colossians|3:22-25|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Timothy|6:1|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Titus|2:9-10|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Peter|2:18}}&lt;/ref&gt; however these particular ''Pauline epistles'' are also [[authorship of the Pauline epistles|those whose Pauline authorship is doubted]] by many modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ehrman |first=Bart D.|authorlink=Bart D.

==Judaism==
{{main|Jewish views on slavery}}
More mainstream forms of first-century [[Judaism]] didn't exhibit such qualms about slavery, and ever since the 2nd-century expulsion of Jews from Judea, wealthy Jews have owned non-Jewish slaves, wherever it was legal to do so;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia 1901"/&gt; nevertheless, manumissions were approved by Jewish religious officials on the slightest of pretexts, and court cases concerning manumission were nearly always decided in favour of freedom, whenever there was uncertainty towards the facts.&lt;ref name="Maimonides, Mishneh Torah"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[minor tractate|The Minor Tractates]]'', ''Abadim'' 9:6&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Talmud]], a document of great importance in Judaism, made many rulings which had the effect of making manumission easier and more likely:
*The costly and compulsory giving of gifts was restricted the 7th-year manumission only.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia 1901"/&gt;
*The price of freedom was reduced to a proportion of the original purchase price rather than the total fee of a hired servant, and could be reduced further if the slave had become weak or sickly (and therefore less saleable).&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia 1901"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maimonides, Mishneh Torah"/&gt;
*Voluntary manumission became officially possible, with the introduction of the manumission deed (the ''shetar shihrur''), which was counted as [[prima facie]] proof of manumission.
*Verbal declarations of manumission could no longer be revoked.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gittin]]'' 1:6&lt;/ref&gt;
*Putting [[Tefillin|phylacteries]] on the slave, or making him publicly read three or more verses from the Torah, was counted as a declaration of the slave's manumission.&lt;ref name="Maimonides, Mishneh Torah"/&gt;
*Extremely long term sickness, for up to four years in total, couldn't count against the slave's right to manumission after six years of enslavement.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia 1901"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maimonides, Mishneh Torah"/&gt;

Jewish participation in the slave trade itself was also regulated by the Talmud. Fear of [[apostasy]] lead to the Talmudic discouragement of the sale of Jewish slaves to non-Jews,&lt;ref&gt;''Gittin'', 4:6&lt;/ref&gt; although loans were allowed;&lt;ref&gt;''Gittin'', 46b&lt;/ref&gt; similarly slave trade with [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] was only to be for the purpose of removing slaves from non-Jewish religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'' (1901), article on ''Fairs''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religious racism]] meant that the Talmudic writers completely forbade the sale or transfer of [[Canaan]]ite slaves out from [[Roman Palestine|Palestine]] to elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;''Gittin'' 4:6&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of trade were also discouraged: men selling themselves to women, and post-[[puberty|pubescent]] daughters being sold into slavery by their fathers.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia 1901"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maimonides, Mishneh Torah"/&gt; Pre-pubescent slave girls sold by their fathers had to be freed-then-married by their new owner, or his son, when she ''started'' [[puberty]];&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia 1901"/&gt; slaves could not be allowed to marry free Jews,&lt;ref&gt;''Gittin'' 4:5&lt;/ref&gt; although masters were often granted access to the ''services'' of the wives of any of their slaves.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nashim|Kiddushin]]'' 22a&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Talmudic law, killing of a slave is punishable in the same way as killing of a freeman, even if it was committed by the owner. While slaves are considered the owner's property, they may not work on Sabbath and holidays; they may acquire and hold property of the own.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Judaica, 2007, vol. 18,'' p. 668&lt;/ref&gt;

Several prominent Jewish writers of the Middle Ages took offense at the idea that Jews might be enslaved; [[Joseph Caro]] and [[Maimonides]] both argue that calling a Jew ''slave'' was so offensive that it should be punished by [[excommunication]].&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', 6:14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Caro, ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', ''Yoreah De'ah'' 334&lt;/ref&gt; However, they did not condemn enslavement of non-Jews. Indeed, they argued that the biblical rule, that slaves should be freed for certain injuries, should actually only apply to slaves who had converted to Judaism;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia 1901"/&gt; additionally, Maimonides argued that this manumission was really punishment of the owner, and therefore it could only be imposed by a court, and required evidence from witnesses.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia 1901"/&gt; Unlike the biblical law protecting fugitive slaves, Maimonides argued that such slaves should be compelled to buy their freedom.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia 1901"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maimonides, Mishneh Torah"/&gt;

At the same time, Maimonides and other [[Halacha|halachic]] authorities forbade or strongly discouraged any unethical treatment of slaves. According to the traditional Jewish law, a slave is more like an indentured servant, who has rights and should be treated almost like a member of the owner's family. Maimonides wrote that, regardless whether a slave is Jewish or not, "The way of the pious and the wise is to be compassionate and to pursue justice, not to overburden or oppress a slave, and to provide them from every dish and every drink. The early sages would give their slaves from every dish on their table. They would feed their servants before sitting to their own meals... Slaves may not be maltreated of offended - the law destined them for service, not for humiliation. Do not shout at them or be angry with them, but hear them out." In another context, Maimonides wrote that all the laws of slavery are "mercy, compassion and forbearance".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Judaica, 2007, vol. 18, p. 670&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/305549/jewish/Torah-Slavery-and-the-Jews.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==

{{main|Christianity and slavery}}

Slavery in different forms existed within [[Christianity]] for over 18 centuries. Although in the [[Early Christianity|early years of Christianity]], freeing slaves was regarded as an act of charity,&lt;ref name="Slavery in the Middle Ages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historymedren.about.com/library/weekly/aa012698.htm|title=Slavery in the Middle Ages|author=Melissa Snell|work=About|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Christian view of equality of all people including slaves was a novelty in the Roman Empire,&lt;ref name=Catholic&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Allard |first=Paul |title=Slavery and Christianity |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |volume=XIV |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |location=New York |year=1912 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14036a.htm |accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the institution of slavery was rarely criticised. Indeed, in 340, the [[Synod of Gangra]] condemned the [[Manicheanism|Manicheans]] for their urging that slaves should liberate themselves; the canons of the Synod instead declared that anyone preaching abolitionism should be anathematised, and that slaves had a "Christian obligation" to submit to their masters. [[Augustine of Hippo]], who renounced his former Manicheanism, argued that slavery was part of the mechanism to preserve the natural order of things;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Pagels]], ''Adam, Eve, and the Serpent'' (1988), page 114&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Chrysostom]], regarded as a saint by [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Roman Catholicism]], argued that slaves should be resigned to their fate, as by "obeying his master he is obeying God".&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Daniel-Rops]], ''Cathedral and Crusade'' (1957), page 263&lt;/ref&gt; but also stated that "Slavery is the fruit of covetousness, of extravagance, of insatiable greediness" in his Epist. ad Ephes.&lt;ref&gt;http://medicolegal.tripod.com/catholicsvslavery.htm  Leroy J. Pletten, Roman Catholic Church
Opposition to Slavery (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; As the Apostle Paul admonished the early Christians; "There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus". And in fact, even some of the first popes were once slaves themselves.&lt;ref name=Catholic /&gt;

In 1452 [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the papal bull [[Dum Diversas]], which granted Afonso V of Portugal the right to reduce any "Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers" to hereditary slavery. The approval of slavery under these conditions was reaffirmed and extended in his Romanus Pontifex bull of 1455. (This was regarding wars caused by the fall on constantinople) In 1488 [[Pope Innocent VIII]] accepted the gift of 100 slaves from [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and distributed those slaves to his cardinals and the Roman nobility. Also, in 1639 [[Pope Urban VIII]] purchased slaves for himself from the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bermejo, S.J. | first = Luis M. | title = Infallibity on Trial | publisher = Christian Classics, Inc. | location = London | year = 1992 | pages = 315–316 | isbn = 0-87061-190-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Popes in the 15th and 16th century denounced slavery as a ''great crime'', including [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]],&lt;ref name=Catholic /&gt; [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]],&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Farnese, ''[[Sublimus Dei]]'' (1537) - [http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Paul03/p3subli.htm online copy]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pope Eugene IV|Eugene IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Gabriele Condulmer, ''[[Sicut Dudum]]'' (1435) - [http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Eugene04/eugene04sicut.htm online copy]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1639, pope Urban VIII forbade slavery, as did Benedict XIV in 1741. In 1815, pope Pius VII demanded of the Congress of Vienna the suppression of the slave trade, and Gregory XVI condemned it again in 1839.&lt;ref name=Catholic /&gt;

In addition, the Dominican friars who arrived at the Spanish settlement at Santo Domingo in 1510 strongly denounced the enslavement of the local Indians. Along with other priests, they opposed their treatment as unjust and illegal in an audience with the Spanish king and in the subsequent royal commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Hugh | title = Rivers of Gold: The Rise of the Spanish Empire | publisher = Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson | location = London | year = 2003| pages = 258–262 | isbn = 0-297-64563-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a response to this position, the Spanish monarchy's subsequent ''[[Requerimiento]]'' provided a religious justification for the enslavement of the local populations, on the pretext of refusing conversion to Roman Catholicism and therefore denying the authority of the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Hugh | title = Rivers of Gold: The Rise of the Spanish Empire | publisher = Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson | location = London | year = 2003| pages = 266 | isbn = 0-297-64563-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other Christian organizations were slaveholders. The 18th century high-church Anglican [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]] owned the Codrington Plantation, in [[Barbados]], containing several hundred slaves, branded on their chests with the word ''Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4694896.stm|title=BBC News story about a belated official apology for the Society's crimes|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Hochschild, ''Bury the Chains, The British Struggle to Abolish Slavery'' (2005), page 61&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Whitefield]], famed for his sparking of the so-called ''[[Great Awakening]]'' of American evangelicalism, overturned a province-wide ban against slavery,&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Dallimore, ''George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century'' (1980), Volume 2&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to own several hundred slaves himself.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Cashin, ''Beloved Bethesda : A History of George Whitefield's Home for Boys'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Whitefield is remembered as one of the first to preach [[History of slavery in Georgia (U.S. state)|to the enslaved]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancentury.org/blogs/archive/2015-01/george-whitefield-s-troubled-relationship-race-and-slavery Thomas S. Kidd, “George Whitefield’s Troubled Relationship to Race and Slavery” (''Christian Century'', Jan 07, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

At other times, Christian groups worked against slavery. The seventh century [[Saint Eligius|Saint Eloi]] used his vast wealth to purchase British and Saxon slaves in groups of 50 and 100 in order to set them free.&lt;ref&gt;Life in Medieval Times by Marjorie Rowling&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in particular were early leaders in [[abolitionism]], attacking slavery since at least 1688. In 1787 the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] was formed, with 9 of the 12 founder members being Quakers; [[William Wilberforce]], an early supporter of the society, went on to push through the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|1807 Slave Trade Act]], striking a major blow against the transatlantic slave trade. Leaders of [[Methodism]] and [[Presbyterianism]] also vehemently denounced human bondage,&lt;ref&gt;Thoughts Upon Slavery, John Wesley, Published in the year 1774, John Wesley: Holiness of Heart and Life, 1996 Ruth A. Daugherty&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles G. Finney, Memoirs (New York: A.S. Barnes, 1876), 324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, Samuel Brown, D.D., Memoir of Alexander McLeod, D.D., New York (New York: Charles Scribner, 145 Nassau Street, 1855), 51&lt;/ref&gt; convincing their congregations to do likewise; Methodists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ket.org/underground/history/westexpansion.htm|title=KET's Underground Railroad - Westward Expansion and the Development of Abolitionist Thought|author=M Ginter|work=ket.org|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Presbyterians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcahistory.org/findingaids/rpcgs/mcleod.html|title=Alexander McLeod's stand against slavery|author=PCA Historical Center Archivist|work=pcahistory.org|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently made the repudiation of slavery a condition of membership.

In the [[Southern United States]], however, support for slavery was strong; [[Abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] literature was prevented from passing through the postal system, and even sermons, from the famed English preacher [[Charles Spurgeon]], were burned due to their censure of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;The Christian Cabinet, Dec. 14 1859&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[American Civil War]] broke out, slavery became one of the issues which would be decided by its outcome; the southern defeat led to a [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional ban on slavery]]. Despite the general emancipation of slaves, members of fringe Christian groups like the [[Christian Identity]] movement, and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] group) see the enslavement of Africans as a positive aspect of American history.

===Slave Christianity===

In the [[United States]], Christianity not only held views about slavery but also on how slaves practiced their own form of Christianity. Prior to the work of [[Melville Herskovits]] in 1941, it was widely believed that all elements of African culture were destroyed by the horrific experiences of Africans forced to come to the United States of America. Since his groundbreaking work, scholarship has found that Slave Christianity existed as an extraordinarily creative patchwork of African and Christian religious tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Lippy, "Slave Christianity" in ''Modern Christianity to 1900: A People's History of Christianity'', ed. Amanda Porterfield (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2007), 291-292.&lt;/ref&gt;  The slaves brought with them a wide variety of religious traditions including both tribal shamanism and [[Islam]]. Beyond that, tribal traditions could vary to a high degree across the African continent.

During the early eighteenth century, Anglican missionaries attempting to bring Christianity to slaves in the Southern colonies often found themselves butting up against not only uncooperative masters, but also resistant slaves. An unquestionable obstacle to the acceptance of Christianity among slaves was their desire to continue to adhere as much as possible to the religious beliefs and rituals of their African ancestors. Missionaries working in the South were especially displeased with slave retention of African practices such as polygamy and what they called idolatrous dancing. In fact, even blacks who embraced Christianity in America did not completely abandon Old World religion. Instead, they engaged in syncretism, blending Christian influences with traditional African rites and beliefs.  Symbols and objects, such as crosses, were conflated with charms carried by Africans to ward off evil spirits. Christ was interpreted as a healer similar to the priests of Africa. In the New World, fusions of African spirituality and Christianity led to distinct new practices among slave populations, including voodoo or vodun in Haiti and Spanish Louisiana. Although African religious influences were also important among Northern blacks, exposure to Old World religions was more intense in the South, where the density of the black population was greater.

There were, however, some commonalities across the majority of tribal traditions. Perhaps the primary understanding of tribal traditions was that there was not a separation of the sacred and the secular.&lt;ref name="Charles H. Lippy 2007"&gt;Charles H. Lippy, "Slave Christianity" in ''Modern Christianity to 1900: A People's History of Christianity'', ed. Amanda Porterfield (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2007), 295.&lt;/ref&gt;   All life was sacred and the supernatural was present in every facet and focus of life. Most tribal traditions highlighted this experience of the supernatural in ecstatic experiences of the supernatural brought on by ritual song and dance. Repetitious music and dancing were often used to bring on these experiences through the use of drums and chanting. The realization of these experiences was in the "possession" of a worshipper in which one not only is taken over by the divine but actually becomes one with the divine.&lt;ref name="Charles H. Lippy 2007"/&gt;

Echoes of African tribal traditions can be seen in the Christianity practiced by slaves in the Americas. The song, dance, and ecstatic experiences of traditional tribal religion were Christianized and practiced by slaves in what is called the "Ring Shout." &lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Lippy, "Slave Christianity" in ''Modern Christianity to 1900: A People's History of Christianity'', ed. Amanda Porterfield (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2007), 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice was a major mark of African American Christianity during the slavery period.

Christianity came more slowly to the slaves of North America. Many colonial slaveholders feared that baptizing slaves would lead to emancipation because of vague laws concerning the slave status of Christians under British colonial rule. Even after 1706, by which time many states had passed laws stating that baptism would not alter slave status, slaveholders were worried that the catechization of slaves wouldn't be a wise economic choice. Slaves usually had one day off each week, usually Sunday. That time was used to grow their own crops, as well as dancing and singing (doing such things on the Sabbath was frowned on by most preachers), so there was little time for slaves to receive religious instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slave Religion : The Invisible Institution in the Antebellum South.|last=Raboteau|first=Albert J.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-19-517412-7|location=USA|pages=39-75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the antebellum period, slave preachers - enslaved or formally enslaved evangelists - became instrumental in shaping slave Christianity. They preached a gospel radically different from that of white preachers, who often used Christianity in an attempt to make slaves more complacent to their enslaved status. Rather than focusing on obedience, slave preachers placed a greater emphasis on the Old Testament, especially the book of Exodus. They likened the plight of the American slaves to the enslaved Hebrews of the Bible, instilling hope into the hearts of those enslaved. Slave preachers were instrumental in shaping the religious landscape of African Americans for decades to come.&lt;ref&gt;Dennard, David C. "Religion in the quarters: a study of slave preachers in the antebellum South, 1800-1860." (1984): 3465-3465.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==

According to [[Bernard Lewis]], slavery has been a part of Islam's history from its beginning.

Hindu [[Vedas]] regard liberation to be the ultimate goal which is contrary to slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KvL3CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=hinduism Religions and Nonviolence: The Rise of Effective Advocacy for Peace: The Rise of Effective Advocacy for Peace], p. 53, ABC-CLIO, Rachel M. MacNair&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu [[Smriti]]s condemn slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of International Humanitarian Law in South Asia|page=36|publisher=Oxford University Press|first=Venkateshwara|last=Subramaniam Mani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "dasa" (dāsa) in ancient Hindu text is loosely translated as "slave."{{sfn|Kumar|1993|p=114}} However, the meaning of the term varied over time. R. S. Sharma, in his 1958 book, for example, states that the only word which could possibly mean slave in Rigveda is dāsa, and this sense of use is traceable to four later verses in Rigveda.{{sfn|R. S. Sharma|1958|pp=(1990:24-26)}} The term dāsa in the Rigveda, has been also been translated as a servant or enemy, and the identity of this term remains unclear and disputed among scholars.{{Sfn|West|2008|p=182}}{{refn|group=note|[a] HH Wilson translates dāsa in Rigvedic instances identified by R.S. Sharma, such as in verse 10.62.10, as servant rather than slave.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/rigvedasanhitc06wils#page/166/mode/2up Rigveda 10.62.10] HH Wilson (Translator), Trubner &amp; Co, page 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wash Edward Hale 1999 page 162"&gt;Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura- in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800618}}, page 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;[b] Michael Witzel suggests that the term ''dāsa'' in Sanskrit corresponds to North [[Iran]]ian tribe; Iranian (Latin) Dahae, (Greek) Daai; and that ''dāsa'' word may be memory of Indo-Aryan migration;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Witzel |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Witzel |title=Autochthonous Aryans? |journal=Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies |volume=7 |number=3 |year=2001 |p=16 |url=http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2008/118}}&lt;/ref&gt; with George Samuel stating that ''dāsa'' may be equivalent for "aborigines, servant or slave".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Samuel |first=Geoffrey |title=The Origins of Yoga and Tantra |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-521-69534-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JAvrTGrbpf4C |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The word ''dāsi'' is found in Rigveda and Atharvaveda, states R.S. Sharma, which he states represented "a small servile class of women slaves".{{sfn|R. S. Sharma|1958|loc=pp. 22-24 (1990:24-26)}} Slavery in Vedic period, according to him, was mostly confined to women employed as domestic workers.{{sfn|R. S. Sharma|1958|p=(1990:103)}} He translates ''dasi'' in a Vedic era Upanishad as "maid-servant".{{sfn|R. S. Sharma|1958|p=45 (1990:50-51)}} Male slaves are rarely mentioned in the Vedic texts.{{sfn|R. S. Sharma|1958|p=45 (1990:50-51)}} The word dāsa occurs in the Hindu Sruti texts Aitareya and Gopatha Brahmanas, but not in the sense of a slave.{{sfn|R. S. Sharma|1958|p=45 (1990:50-51)}}

Towards the end of the Vedic period (600 BCE), a new system of ''varnas'' had appeared, with people called [[shudra]]s replacing the erstwhile ''dasas''. Some of the ''shudras'' were employed as labouring masses on farm land, much like "[[helots]] of [[Sparta]]", even though they were not treated with the same degree of coercion and contempt.{{sfn|R. S. Sharma|1958|p=48 (1990:53)}} They could be given away as gifts along with the land, which came in for criticism from the religious texts ''Āśvalāyana'' and ''Kātyāyana'' ''[[Srautasutra|Śrautasūtra]]s''.{{sfn|R. S. Sharma|1958|p=46 (1990:51-52)}} The term ''dasa'' was now employed to designate such enslaved people.{{sfn|R. S. Sharma|1958|p=91 (1990:103)}} Slavery arose out of debt, sale by parents or oneself (due to famines), judicial decree or fear. The slaves were differentiated by origin and different disabilities and rules for manumission applied. While this could happen to a person of any ''varna'', ''shudras'' were much more likely to be reduced to slavery.{{sfn|R. S. Sharma|1958|p=92 (1990:104)}}{{sfn|Kumar|1993|p=114}}

The [[Arthashastra]] laid down norms for the State to resettle ''shudra'' cultivators into new villages and providing them with land, grain, cattle and money.{{sfn|R. S. Sharma|1958|p=147 (1990:161-163)}} It also stated that ''aryas'' could not be subject to slavery and that the selling or mortgaging of a ''shudra'' was punishable unless he was a born slave.{{sfn|R. S. Sharma|1958|p=163 (1990:177)}}

==Buddhism==
In Pali language Buddhist texts, ''Amaya-dasa'' has been translated by Davids and Stede in 1925, as a "slave by birth",&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Rhys Davids, William Stede (2015 Reprint, Original: 1925), Pali-English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120811447}}, page 104&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kila-dasa'' translated as a "bought slave",&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Rhys Davids, William Stede (2015 Reprint, Original: 1925), Pali-English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120811447}}, page 217&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Amata-dasa'' as "one who sees Amata (Sanskrit: ''Amrita'', nectar of immortality) or [[Nibbana]]".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Rhys Davids, William Stede (2015 Reprint, Original: 1925), Pali-English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120811447}}, page 73&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''dasa'' in ancient texts can also mean "servant".&lt;ref name=schopen&gt;Gregory Schopen (2004), Buddhist Monks and Business Matters, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824827748}}, page 201&lt;/ref&gt;

Words related to ''dasa'' are found in early Buddhist texts, such as ''dāso na pabbājetabbo'', which Davids and Stede translate as "the slave cannot become a Bhikkhu".&lt;ref name=davidsstedeped320&gt;Thomas William Rhys Davids and William Stede (2015 Reprint, Original: 1925), Pali-English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120811447}}, page 320&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction on who could become a Buddhist monk is found in Vinaya Pitakam i.93, [[Digha Nikaya]], [[Majjhima Nikāya]], Tibetan ''Bhiksukarmavakya'' and ''Upasampadajnapti''.&lt;ref name=davidsstedeped320/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Schopen (2010), On Some Who Are Not Allowed to Become Buddhist Monks or Nuns: An Old List of Types of Slaves or Unfree Laborers, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 130, No. 2, pages 225-234&lt;/ref&gt; Schopen states that this translation of ''dasa'' as slave is disputed by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Schopen (2010), On Some Who Are Not Allowed to Become Buddhist Monks or Nuns: An Old List of Types of Slaves or Unfree Laborers, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 130, No. 2, page 226&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Buddhist texts in Pali, according to [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], mention ''dāsa'' and ''kammakaras'', and they show that those who failed to pay their debts were enslaved, and Buddhism did not allow debtors and slaves to join their monasteries.{{sfn|R. S. Sharma|1958|p=(1990:103)}}

The Buddhist Emperor [[Ashoka]] banned slavery and renounced war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BTKCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT130&amp;dq=Ashoka The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World], p.130, SAGE publication, Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smot chanting''', or '''smot''' is a traditional form of [[Buddhist chant|Buddhist chanting]] in [[Buddhism in Cambodia|Cambodia]].

Smot is chanted at funerals and other ceremonies, and includes songs about the Buddha's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[file:Mykenischer Kulturkreis.png|thumb|Mycenian cultural environment (ca. 1400 BC)]]
Among the first archaeological sites discovered in [[Mount Olympus]] was the excavation site '''Spathes''' (Greek Σπάθες, swords). It is a [[necropolis]] from the Late [[Bronze Age]]. The oldest tombs are from the 14th century BC, the last traces of the use were found from the end of the 13th century, the beginning of the 12th century BC. The settlement, associated with the necropolis, has not been found. Many of the burial offerings were made in the Mycenaean style, so that the Mycenaean cultural circle probably also (see also [[History of Pieria (regional unit)|History and archaeology Pierias]]) extended over the border of [[Thessaly]] to [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]].&lt;ref&gt;Poulaki-Pandermali, Efi. ''Makedonikos Olympos''. Greek Ministry of Culture and Sport, 2013, pages 56 and 59&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
Near the village of Agios Dimitrios, on the border with Thessaly, in 1000 to 1100 meters altitude, on a hillside. The burial site runs from northeast to southwest direction.

== Excavation history ==
[[File:Spathes.jpg|thumb|Necropolis Spathes]]
In 1975, the relevant archaeological authority was informed that several tombs (at least 12 to 13) were destroyed when a firebrake was cut. A bronze sword was found then. Further information revealed that trade was operated with the burial objects from this site. 1985 began trial excavations, which were continued in 1986. The excavations brought to light 34 tombs, which were partly destroyed and plundered. A part of the stolen goods was later found in the storehouse of the [[Archaeological Museum of Dion|Archaeological Museum in Dion]]. In 1985, some of the stone slabs that covered the tombs were stolen by unknown culprits. A part of the slope was brought to a drop by heavy snowfalls. In the years 1987 and 1988 the slope was terraced and stabilized by a wooden construction. Near the excavation site Spathes, 1987 more tombs were discovered, presumably from the same epoch. Six stone seals were recovered from them, further excavations were not held.&lt;ref&gt;Poulaki-Pandermali, Efi. ''Makedonikos Olympos''. Greek Ministry of Culture and Sport, 2013, page 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greek Ministry of Culture and Sport, Aristoteles University Thessaloniki, ''Το Αρχαιολογικό Έργο στή Μακεδονία και Θράκη ((The archeolgical work in Macedonia and Thrace) Nr. 1'', 1987, page 200&lt;/ref&gt;

== Necropolis ==
As in this region of Greece, at the end of the Bronze Age, the deceased were usually buried in box-shaped tombs. The type of these tombs is known from southern Greece. The length of the tombs is approximately 2.40 meters, the width 1.50 meters and the depth between one and 2.50 meters. The bottom of the tombs was covered with a 10 to 20 centimeter high clay layer, the side walls were framed with stone slabs. The graves were intact except for penetrating roots and natural deposits of the building materials. The number of buried persons found in the intact tombs is 52. It is unusual that in each of the tombs several people were buried, presumably they were family tombs. They were buried next to each other, partly also upon one another; In addition to the skeletons of adults, the remains of children were also found.&lt;ref&gt;Poulaki-Pandermali, Efi. ''Makedonikos Olympos''. Greek Ministry of Culture and Sport, 2013, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

== Finds ==
[[File:Bronzenes Schwert.jpg|thumb|Bronzen Sword, found near Platamonas]]
In addition to weapons and jewelry, the deceased was mainly given pottery. However, some of them were broken by the kind of burial of several people within the same tomb. The vessels were partly handmade, partly they were modeled with a potter's wheel. The most important finds were made in a tomb, in which apparently high ranking personalities were buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2565519/Social_Status_as_Reflected_through_Metal_Objects_Found_in_Archaic_Burials_from_Macedonia|title=Social Status as Reflected through Metal Objects Found in Archaic Burials from Macedonia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two skeletons, one male and one female, found themselves alongside rich burial gifts. Remnants of a spear, a bronze sword, painted and unpainted vases and perfume bottles, jewelry and stone seals (partly with animal motifs) were discovered. The sword is somewhat smaller, but resembles in the kind of swords found in [[Mycenae]] and [[Crete]] ([[Knossos]], [[Heraklion]]). A bronze sword found in another tomb is of the same making as swords discovered in [[Athens]], Crete, [[Kos]] and other locations. Recently, excavations on the southeast side of Olympus, to the west of [[Platamonas]], have revealed an identical sword.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2370">A '''Superior General''' or '''General Superior''' is the leader or head of a [[religious institute]] in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. The Superior General usually holds supreme executive authority in the religious order, while the [[general chapter]] has legislative authority.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The figure of Superior General first emerged in the thirteenth century with the development of the [[centralized government]] of the [[Mendicant Orders]]. The Friars Minor ([[Franciscans]]) organized their community under a Minister General, and the Order of Preachers ([[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]) appointed a Master General.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Due to restrictions on women religious, especially the obligation of cloister for [[nun]]s, congregations of women were not initially able to organize with their own Superior General. In 1609, [[Mary Ward (nun)|Mary Ward]] was the superior general of a religious institute that imitated the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] model, but the institute was not accepted by the [[Roman Curia]]. It was in the nineteenth century that religious congregations of women were able to organize with a General Superior and the role is now very common. [[Mother Teresa of Calcutta|Mother Teresa]], for example, was the Mother General of the [[Missionaries of Charity]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], the generic term '''Supreme Moderator''' is used instead of Superior General. Many orders and congregations use their own title for the person who holds this position. Some examples are: 
* [[Abbot]] general
* [[Custos-general]] 
* [[Master general]] 
* [[Minister General]]
* Mother General
* [[Prior General]] 
* [[Rector general]]
* General Director / Directress

In many cases there is an intermediate level between the Superior General and the superior of the individual monasteries or of equivalent communities, often named the [[provincial superior]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures''''' is a 1997 book by [[Anne Fadiman]] that chronicles the struggles of a [[Hmong people|Hmong]] refugee family from Houaysouy, [[Sainyabuli Province]], [[Laos]],&lt;ref name="Fadiman103"&gt;[[Anne Fadiman|Fadiman]]. "Foua and Nao Kao." ''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 1997. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DUHAXXvSUeYC&amp;pg=PA103 103]. "[...]I asked her to describe a typical day in Houaysouy, the village in the northwestern province of Sayaboury where the Lee family had lived."&lt;/ref&gt; the Lees, and their interactions with the health care system in [[Merced, California]]. In 2005 Robert Entenmann, [[Ph.D.]], of [[St. Olaf College]] wrote that the book is "certainly the most widely read book on the Hmong experience in America."&lt;ref name=Entenmannp1&gt;Entenmann, Robert. "[http://hmongstudies.org/EntenmannHSJ6.pdf The Myth of Sonom, the Hmong King]." ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6QyjDhsaM?url=http://hmongstudies.org/EntenmannHSJ6.pdf |date=2014-07-11 }}) ''[[Hmong Studies Journal]]'', Volume 6, 2005. p. 1. Retrieved on July 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the most basic level, the book tells the story of the family's second youngest and favored daughter, Lia Lee, who was diagnosed with a severe form of [[epilepsy]] named [[Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome]]  and the culture conflict that obstructs her treatment.

Through miscommunications about medical dosages and parental refusal to give certain medicines due to mistrust, misunderstandings, and behavioral side effects, and the inability of the doctors to develop more empathy with the traditional Hmong lifestyle or try to learn more about the Hmong culture, Lia's condition worsens. The dichotomy between the Hmong's perceived spiritual factors and the Americans' perceived scientific factors comprises the overall theme of the book.

The book is written in a unique style, with every other chapter returning to Lia's story and the chapters in-between discussing broader themes of [[Hmong customs and culture|Hmong culture, customs, and history]]; American involvement in and responsibility for the war in Laos; and the many problems of immigration, especially assimilation and discrimination. While particularly sympathetic to the Hmong, Fadiman presents the situation from the perspectives of both the doctors and the family. An example of [[medical anthropology]], the book has been cited by medical journals and lecturers as an argument for greater [[cultural competence]], and often assigned to medical, pharmaceutic, and anthropological students in the US. In 1997, it won the [[National Book Critics Circle]] Award for General Nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/page_2 National Book Critics Circle - past awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

She had seizures due to ''[[Lennox–Gastaut syndrome|Lennox-Gastaut]]'' [[Lennox–Gastaut syndrome|syndrome]], a severe form of ''epilepsy''.

'''Anne Fadiman''': She is an author and narrator of ‘The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down’. She wrote about her experience with Lia and her family. Through this experience, she learned the importance of understanding about diversity of culture between doctor, patient, and family.

'''Neil Ernst and Peggy Philp''': They are Lia’s doctors at MCMC. There is conflict between them and Lia's parents because of Hmong shamanism culture versus western medicine.  This leads to great misunderstandings between each other.

'''Foua Yang and Nao Kao Lee''': They are Lia’s parents, and they love Lia very much. They only believe in their traditional approach to medical treatment, with a strong influence from shamanism.

'''Jeanine Hilt''': A [[social work]]er who makes Lia her personal cause. She fights against the medical establishment on Lia’s behalf and cares for the Hmong as a significant culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Clapsaddle|first=Diane|title=The Spirit Catches You Study Guide02|url=http://thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Spirit_Catches_You_Fadiman/The_Spirit_Catches_You_Study_Guide02.html|website=TheBestNotes.com|date=20 Mar 2015|accessdate=12 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fadiman/&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Merced, Mercy General.JPG|thumb|[[Mercy Medical Center Merced]], previously the Merced Community Medical Center; this is a new building and not the previous building where Lia Lee was taken]]
Lia experienced her first [[seizure]] at three months of age, but a resident at [[Merced Community Medical Center]] misdiagnosed her condition, and the hospital was unable to communicate with her parents since the hospital had no [[Hmong language|Hmong]] interpreters. [[Anne Fadiman]] wrote that Lia's parents did not give her medication as it was prescribed because they believed that Lia Lee's state showed a sense of spiritual giftedness, and they did not want to take that away. The American doctors did not understand the Hmong traditional remedies that the Lee family used. The doctors treating Lia Lee, Neil and Peggy Ernst, had her removed from her home when she was almost three years of age, and placed into [[foster care]] for one year, causing friction with her parents. By age 4½ Lia Lee had been admitted to hospital care 17 times and had made over 100 outpatient visits.&lt;ref name=Foxdead2&gt;Fox, Margalit. "Lia Lee Dies; Life Went On Around Her, Redefining Care." ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 14, 2012. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/us/life-went-on-around-her-redefining-care-by-bridging-a-divide.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;ref=obituaries 2]. Retrieved on October 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The worst seizure Lia had put her onto the verge of death. She went to the emergency room and Dr. Neil Ernst could not do anything. He talked to Lia's parents about transferring her to Fresno, California because Lia would need further treatment that Dr. Ernst could not provide.  Lia's parents ". . .  believed their daughter was transferred not because of her critical condition but because of the Ernst's vacation plans".
Lia Lee slipped into a coma after suffering from a [[grand mal seizure]] in 1986, when she was four years of age. Lia Lee's doctors believed she would die, but Lia Lee remained alive but with no higher brain functions.&lt;ref name=Foxdead2/&gt;

==Research==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
Fadiman's sources for information about the history of the Hmong include ''[[Hmong: History of a People]]'' by Keith Quincy. She stated "Were I citing the source of each detail, Quincy's name would attach itself to nearly every sentence in the pages on the Hmong in China."&lt;ref name=fadiman&gt;{{citation|last=Fadiman|title=The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down|date=September 30, 1998|isbn=9781429931113|url=http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp370-us15/files/2015/05/The-Spirit-Catches-You-and-You-Anne-Fadiman.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fadiman's book cited the Quincy theory that the Hmong people originated from Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Pfeifer|Pfeifer, Mark E.]] ([[Hmong Cultural and Resource Center]]). "[http://hmongstudies.org/PremodernHmongHistory.pdf Overview of Recent Scholarship on Premodern Hmong History]" ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qz49SIUA?url=http://hmongstudies.org/PremodernHmongHistory.pdf |date=2014-07-11 }}). ''[[Hmong Studies Journal]]'' at ''Hmong Studies Internet Resource Center''. Presentation at the "[http://www.hmongstudies.com/HmongWomensConference.html “Building on Hmong Women’s Assets: Past, Present, and Future” September 16-17, 2005, St. Paul/Minneapolis, MN]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6Qz7GBp6m?url=http://www.hmongstudies.com/HmongWomensConference.html Archive]).&lt;/ref&gt; Entenmann wrote that because of the reliance on Quincy's book, Fadiman's book propagates the idea that [[Sonom]] was a Hmong king, a concept that Entenmann says is inaccurate.&lt;ref name=Entenmannp1/&gt;

==Legacy==
Marilyn Mochel, a nurse and clinical educator at Sutter Merced Medical Center&lt;!--This is the hospital which treated Lia Lee!!!!--&gt; (now [[Mercy Medical Center Merced]]), who heads the hospital's cross-cultural program, said in 1999 that "The book has allowed more dialogue. There's certainly more awareness and dialogue than before. Both sides are teachers and learners."&lt;ref name="Jennings"&gt;Jennings, Ralph. "[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MS&amp;p_theme=ms&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F1D5920117213F7&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM MERCED HOSPITAL FILLS CULTURAL PRESCRIPTION]." ''[[The Modesto Bee]]''. Sunday March 21, 1999. B3. Retrieved on March 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lia Lee lived in a persistent vegetative state for 26 years. She died in [[Sacramento, California]], on August 31, 2012 at the age of 30.&lt;ref name="Foxdead1"/&gt; At that age she weighed {{convert|47|lbs|kg}} and was {{convert|4|ft|7|in|m}} tall; many children with severe brain damage have limited growth as they age.&lt;ref name=Foxdead3&gt;Fox, Margalit. "Lia Lee Dies; Life Went On Around Her, Redefining Care." ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 14, 2012. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/us/life-went-on-around-her-redefining-care-by-bridging-a-divide.html?pagewanted=3&amp;ref=obituaries 3]. Retrieved on October 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the [[State of California]] Lia Lee's death was not widely reported. Fadiman said that [[pneumonia]] was the immediate cause of death. Margalit Fox of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "[b]ut Lia’s underlying medical issues were more complex still" because she had lived in a persistent vegetative state for such a long period of time. As of 2012 most individuals who go into that state die three to five years afterwards.&lt;ref name=Foxdead1/&gt;

==Reception==
Ralph Jennings of ''[[The Modesto Bee]]'' said "Hmong, including some among the 2,000 in [[Modesto, California|Modesto]], say the book typified conflicts between their culture and American institutions. But some say it didn't capture the complexity of the Hmong culture."&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;

Cheng Lee, a brother of Lia Lee, said that his father and mother liked Fadiman's book.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;

“Compellingly written, from the heart and from the trenches. I couldn’t wait to finish it, then reread it and ponder it again. It is a powerful case study of a medical tragedy.” - David H. Mark, Journal of the American Medical Association

Anne Fadiman's essay "Hmong Odyssey," adapted from the book, was published in the March–April 1998 ''[[Via (magazine)|Via]]''. The Hmong community leaders in [[Fresno, California]] praised the essay, saying that it was thoughtful and accurate.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=FB&amp;p_theme=fb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAE8A732D83B82C&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM ESSAY VS.

Discussion has centered on such themes as the conflict between modern human and [[environmentalism|nature]], and the film's treatment of [[imperialism]], [[racism]], [[militarism]] and [[patriotism]], corporate greed, [[property rights]], [[spirituality]] and [[religion]].  Commentators have debated whether the film's treatment of the human aggression against the native [[Naʼvi|Na'vi]] is a message of support for indigenous peoples today, or is, instead, a tired retelling of the racist myth of the [[noble savage]].&lt;ref name="themes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/12/11/PK4B1B0EHD.DTL&amp;type=movies|last=Ordoña|first=Michael|date=December 14, 2009|title=Eye-popping 'Avatar' pioneers new technology|accessdate=December 14, 2009|work=[[San Francisco Gate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYThemes&gt;{{cite news|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=January 20, 2010|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/movies/20avatar.html?hp |title=You saw what in ‘Avatar’?

The visual similarity between the [[collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] and the felling of Home Tree in the film caused some filmgoers to further identify with the Na'vi and to identify the human military contractors as [[terrorist]]s.  Critics asked whether this comparison was intended to encourage audiences to empathize with the position of [[Muslim]]s under [[military occupation]] today.&lt;ref name=BolPress&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldmeets.us/bolpress000009.shtml|title=Jesus Christ and the movie Avatar|author=Huascar Vega Ledo|work=BolPress via translation by worldmeets.us|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=February 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LeMonde&gt;{{cite web|first=Pierre|last=Desjardins|date=January 28, 2010|url=http://worldmeets.us/lemonde0000223.shtml|title=Avatar: Nothing but a 'stupid justification for war!'|accessdate=February 18, 2010|work=[[Le Monde]] via translation by worldmeets.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much discussion has concerned the film's treatment of environmental protection and the parallels to, for example, the destruction of [[rainforest]]s, [[mountaintop removal]] for mining and evictions from homes for development.  The title of the film and various visual and story elements provoked discussion of the film's use of [[Hindu iconography]], which Cameron confirmed had inspired him.&lt;ref name=ew.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/avatar-11-burning-questions|title='Avatar:' 11 burning questions|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Svetkey|first=Benjamin|date=January 15, 2010|accessdate=January 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ReutersIN&gt;{{cite news|title="Avatar" may be subconsciously linked to India – Cameron|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/bollywoodNews/idINIndia-46916320100315|first=Shilpa|last=Jamkhandikar|date=March 15, 2010|accessdate=March 15, 2010|work=[[Reuters]] India}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Christian]]s, including [[Holy See|the Vatican]], worried that the film promotes [[pantheism]] over Christian beliefs, while others instead thought that it sympathetically explores biblical concepts.

''Avatar'' describes the conflict by an [[indigenous people]], the [[Naʼvi|Na'vi]] of [[Fictional universe of Avatar|Pandora]], against the oppression of alien humans.  Director [[James Cameron]] acknowledged that the film is "certainly about [[imperialism]] in the sense that the way human history has always worked is that people with more military or technological might tend to supplant or destroy people who are weaker, usually for their resources."&lt;ref name=themes /&gt;  Critics agreed that the film is "a clear message about dominant, aggressive cultures subjugating a native population in a quest for resources or riches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/conservative-criticism-of-avatar-is-misplaced/story-e6frerdf-1225816862571| title=Conservative criticism of Avatar is misplaced| last=Atkins| first=Dennis| date=January 7, 2010| accessdate=March 3, 2010| work=[[The Courier Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Monbiot]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', asserted that conservative criticism of ''Avatar'' is a reaction to what he called the film's "chilling metaphor" for the European "genocides in the Americas", which "massively enriched" Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jan/11/mawkish-maybe-avatar-profound-important|title=Mawkish, maybe.

=== Militarism ===
Cameron stated that ''Avatar'' is "very much a political film" and added: "This movie reflects that we are living through war.

Cameron said that Americans have a "moral responsibility" to understand the impact of their country's recent military campaigns.  Commenting on the term "[[shock and awe]]" in the film, Cameron said: "We know what it feels like to launch the missiles.

A critic writing in ''[[Le Monde]]'' opined that, contrary to the perceived pacifism of ''Avatar'', the film justifies war in the response to attack by the film's positive characters, particularly the American hero who encourages the Na'vi to "follow him into battle.&amp;nbsp;... Every war, even those that seem the most insane [are justified as being] for the 'right reasons'."&lt;ref name="LeMonde"/&gt;  [[Ann Marlowe]] of ''Forbes'' saw the film as both pro- and anti-military, "a metaphor for the networked military".&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;

== Social and cultural themes ==

=== Civilization and race ===
Commentators around the world sought to interpret the relationship between the Na'vi and humans in the film, mostly agreeing with Maxim Osipov, who wrote in the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'': "The 'civilised humans' turn out as primitive, jaded and increasingly greedy, cynical, and brutal—traits only amplified by their machinery—while the 'monkey aliens' emerge as noble, kind, wise, sensitive and humane. We, along with the ''Avatar'' hero, are now faced with an uncomfortable yet irresistible choice between the two races and the two worldviews."  Osipov wrote that it was inevitable that the audience, like the film's hero, Jake, would find that the Na'vi's culture was really the more civilized of the two, exemplifying "the qualities of kindness, gratitude, regard for the elder, self-sacrifice, respect for all life and ultimately humble dependence on a higher intelligence behind nature."&lt;ref name=HT&gt;{{cite web|last=Osipov|first=Maxim|date=December 27, 2009|url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/what-on-pandora-does-culture-or-civilisation-stand-for/story-W2BVYiBsfcjdNwgil4nViI.html|title=What on Pandora does culture or civilisation stand for? |work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;{{cite web|last=Osipov|first=Maxim|date=January 4, 2010|url= http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/avatars-reversal-of-fortune-20100104-lpod.html|title=Avatar’s reversal of fortune |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Echoing this analysis, psychologist Jeffery Fine in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' urged "every man, woman and child" to see the film and wake up to its message by making the right choice between commercial materialism, which is "steamrolling our soul and consciousness", and reconnection with all life as "the only&amp;nbsp;... promise of survival" for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fine|first=Jeffrey| url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/03/12/1526091_why-avatar-didnt-win-the-oscar.html| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ogyRrAbP|title=Why Avatar didn't win the Oscar: Psychologist Dr. Jeffrey Fine asserts the corporate world is bulldozing America|date=March 12, 2010|archivedate=April 2, 2010|publisher=[[PRNewswire]]|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|accessdate=March 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, an [[Angola]]n critic saw the film as a message of hope, writing, "With this union of humans and aliens comes a feeling that something better exists in the universe: the respect for life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matos|first=Altino|url= http://worldmeets.us/jornaldeangola000002.shtml |work=Journal de Angola via translation by worldmeets.us|date=January 9, 2010|accessdate=February 13, 2010|title=Avatar holds out hope for something better}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cameron confirmed that "the Na'vi represent the better aspects of human nature, and the human characters in the film demonstrate the more venal aspects of human nature."&lt;ref name=Wrap /&gt;

Conversely, [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] of ''The New York Times'' opined that ''Avatar'' creates "a sort of two-edged cultural imperialism", an offensive cultural stereotype that white people are rationalist and technocratic while colonial victims are spiritual and athletic and that illiteracy is the path to grace.&lt;ref name=Brooks /&gt;  A review in the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' found the film to contrast a "mix of [[New Age]] environmentalism and the myth of the [[Noble Savage]]" with the corruption of the "civilized" white man.&lt;ref name=IRIN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/david-quinn-spirituality-is-real-reason-behind-avatars-success-2038398.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rmhu21pw|archivedate=2010-08-06|title=Spirituality is real reason behind Avatar's success|work=[[Irish Independent]]|last=Quinn|first=David|date=January 29, 2010|accessdate=February 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Reihan Salam]], writing in ''Forbes'', viewed it as ironic that "Cameron has made a dazzling, gorgeous indictment of the kind of society that produces James Camerons."&lt;ref name=Forbes2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/12/20/avatar-media-james-cameron-opinions-columnists-reihan-salam.html|title=The case against 'Avatar'|first=Reihan|last=Salam|date=December 21, 2009|accessdate=February 28, 2010|work=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Māori people|Māori]] academic Rawiri Taonui agreed that the film portrays indigenous people as being simplistic and unable to defend themselves without the help from "the white guys and the neo-liberals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/3201437/Avatar-recycles-indigenous-stereotypes|title=Avatar recycles indigenous 'stereotypes'|last=Gates|first=Charlie|date=January 1, 2010|accessdate=March 13, 2010|work=stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another author remarked that while the white man will fix the destruction, he will never feel guilty, even though he is directly responsible for the destruction."&lt;ref name=ArabNews /&gt;  Likewise, [[Josef Joffe]], publisher-editor of ''[[Die Zeit]]'' in [[Germany]], said the film perpetuates the myth of the "noble savage" and has "a condescending, yes, even racist message.

On the ''Charlie Rose'' talk show, Cameron acknowledged parallels with idea of the "noble savage", but argued: "When indigenous populations who are at a bow and arrow level are met with technological superior forces, [if] somebody doesn't help them, they lose. So we are not talking about a racial group within an existing population fighting for their rights."&lt;ref name=ChR /&gt;  Cameron rejected claims that the film is racist, asserting that ''Avatar'' is about respecting others' differences.&lt;ref name=HuffRace/&gt;  Adam Cohen of ''The New York Times'' felt similarly, writing that the Na'vi greeting "I see you" contrasts with the oppression of, and even [[genocide]] against, those who we fail to accept for what they are, citing Jewish [[ghettos]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[GULAG|gulags]] as examples.&lt;ref name=NYTeditorial /&gt;

=== Environment and property ===
''Avatar'' has been called "without a doubt the most epic piece of environmental advocacy ever captured on celluloid....

It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back."&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;  An article in the [[Belgium]] paper ''[[De Standaard]]'' agreed: "It's about the brutality of man, who shamelessly takes what isn't his."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldmeets.us/destandaard000001.shtml|work=[[De Standaard]] via translation by worldmeets.us|author=Oscar van den Boogaard|accessdate=February 13, 2010|title=What does avatar mean to you?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators connected the film's story to the endangerment of biodiversity in the Amazon [[rainforest]]s of [[Brazil]] by dam construction, logging, mining, and clearing for agriculture.&lt;ref name=HuffEnv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lori-pottinger/emavatarem-should-brazil_b_430724.html|title=Avatar: Should Brazil ban the film?|last=Pottinger|first=Lori|date=January 21, 2010|accessdate=February 20, 2010|work=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''[[Newsweek]]'' piece commented on the destruction of Home Tree as resembling the rampant tree-felling in [[Tibet]],&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/233068|title=Confucius says: Ouch—'Avatar' trumps China's great sage|last=Liu|first=Milinda|date=February 4, 2010|accessdate=February 19, 2010|work=[[Newsweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another article compared the film's depiction of destructive corporate mining for [[unobtanium]] in the Na'vi lands with the mining and milling of [[uranium]] near the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] reservation in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fKc7raxL|archivedate=February 15, 2016|title=Avatar unmasked: the real Na'vi and unobtanium|url=http://www.pej.org/html/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=8059&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0|date=February 17, 2010|accessdate=March 5, 2010|last=Schmidt|first=Diane J.|work=pej.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other critics, however, dismissed ''Avatar'''s pro-environmental stance as inconsistent.

The destruction of the Na'vi habitat to make way for mining operations has also evoked parallels with the oppressive policies of some states often involving forcible evictions related to development.

David Quinn of the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' wrote that the spirituality depicted "goes some way towards explaining the film's gigantic popularity, and that is the fact that ''Avatar'' is essentially a religious film, even if Cameron might not have intended it as such."&lt;ref name=IRIN /&gt;  At the same time, [[Jonah Goldberg]] of ''[[National Review Online]]'' objected to what he saw in the film reviews as "the norm to speak glowingly of spirituality but derisively of traditional religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/419321/iavatari-and-the-faith-instinct/jonah-goldberg|title=Avatar and the faith instinct|date=December 30, 2009|accessdate=March 7, 2010|last=Goldberg|first=Jonah|work=[[National Review Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Cameron has said that he "tried to make a film that would touch people's spirituality across the broad spectrum."&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt; He also stated that one of the film's philosophical underpinnings is that "the Na'vi represent that sort of aspirational part of ourselves that wants to be better, that wants to respect nature, while the humans in the film represent the more venal versions of ourselves, the banality of evil that comes with corporate decisions that are made out of remove of the consequences."&lt;ref name=npr /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wrap /&gt;&lt;ref name=Q&amp;A /&gt;  Film director [[John Boorman]] saw a similar dichotomy as a key factor contributing to its success: "Perhaps the key is the marine in the wheelchair. He is disabled, but Mr Cameron and technology can transport him into the body of a beautiful, athletic, sexual, being.  After all, we are all disabled in one way or another; inadequate, old, broken, earthbound.  Pandora is a kind of heaven where we can be resurrected and connected instead of disconnected and alone."&lt;ref name=IRIN /&gt;

=== Religions and mythology ===
Reviewers suggested that the film draws upon many existing religious and mythological motifs. [[Vern Barnet]] of the ''[[Charlotte Observer]]'' opined that ''Avatar'' poses a great question of faith—should the creation be seen and governed hierarchically, from above, or ecologically, through mutual interdependence?

''[[The Times of India]]'' suggested ''Avatar'' was a treatise on Indianism "for [[Indophile]]s and Indian philosophy enthusiasts", starting from the very word ''Avatar'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kazmi|first=Nikhat|date=December 17, 2009|accessdate=February 12, 2010|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/english/Avatar/movie-review/5348868.cms|title=Avatar|work=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' piece critiqued the film in terms of the ancient [[Hinduism|Hindu]] epics ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', commenting on the Na'vi visual similarity with [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]—avatars central to the respective epics and traditionally depicted with blue skin, black hair, and a [[tilak]] mark on the forehead.&lt;ref name=HCR&gt;{{cite web|last=Lassin|first=Arlene Nisson|date=December 29, 2009|accessdate=February 13, 2010|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/religion/6777326.html| title=New movie Avatar shines light on Hindu word|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another critic found that elements of the film's plot resembled such teachings and concepts of Hinduism as [[reincarnation]] of the soul, ecological consciousness, and incarnations of deities on Earth, commending ''Avatar'' and its director for "raising the global stature of Hinduism&amp;nbsp;... in months", while criticizing them for substantiating the western reluctance to accept anything oriental in its pristine form.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes /&gt;

Cameron calls the connection a "subconscious" reference: "I have just loved&amp;nbsp;... the mythology, the entire [[Hindu deities|Hindu pantheon]], seems so rich and vivid." He continued, "I didn't want to reference the Hindu religion so closely, but the subconscious association was interesting, and I hope I haven't offended anyone in doing so."&lt;ref name=ReutersIN /&gt; He has stated that he was familiar with a lot of beliefs of the Hindu religion and found it "quite fascinating".&lt;ref name=TOI /&gt;

Answering a question from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 2007, "What is an ''[[Avatar]]'' anyway?" James Cameron replied, "It's an [[incarnation]] of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1576622,00.html#ixzz0a69HUhNB|title=Q&amp;A with James Cameron|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]|last=Winters Keegan|first=Rebecca|date=January 11, 2007|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, Cameron confirmed the meaning of the title to the ''Times of India'': "Of course, that was the significance in the film, although the characters are not divine beings.  But the idea was that they take flesh in another body."&lt;ref name=TOI/&gt;

Following the film's release, reviewers focused on Cameron's choice of the religious [[Sanskrit]] term for the film's title. A reviewer in the ''Irish Times'' traced the term to the [[Dashavatara|ten incarnations]] of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name=IrishTimes /&gt;  Another writer for ''[[The Hindu]]'' concluded that by using the "loaded Sanskrit word" Cameron indicated the possibility that an encounter with an emotionally superior—but technologically inferior—form of alien may in the future become a next step in human evolution—provided we will learn to integrate and change, rather than conquer and destroy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nayar|first=Parvathi|date=December 24, 2009|accessdate=February 12, 2010|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/article69898.ece|title=Encounters of the weird kind|work=[[The Hindu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxim Osipov of [[ISKCON]] argued in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' that "Avatar" is a "downright misnomer" for the film because "the movie reverses the very concept [that] the term 'avatar'—literally, in Sanskrit, 'descent'—is based on.  So much for a descending 'avatar', Jake becomes a refugee among the aborigines."&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt;  Vern Barnet in ''Charlotte Observer'' likewise thought that the title insults traditional Hindu usage of the term since it is a human, not a god, who descends in the film.&lt;ref name=CHAR /&gt;  However, Rishi Bhutada, Houston coordinator of the [[Hindu American Foundation]], stated that while there are certain sacred terms that would offend Hindus if used improperly, 'avatar' is not one of them.&lt;ref name=HCR /&gt;  [[Texas]]-based filmmaker Ashok Rao added that 'avatar' does not always mean a representative of God on Earth, but simply one being in another form—especially in literature, moviemaking, poetry and other forms of art.&lt;ref name=HCR /&gt;

Explaining the choice of the color blue for the Na'vi, Cameron said "I just like blue.

Discussing explicit or implicit similarities between the film and the philosophy of Hinduism,  reviewers suggested that, just as Hindu gods, particularly Vishnu, become avatars to save the order of the universe, the film’s avatar must descend to avert impending ultimate doom, effected by a rapacious greed that leads to destroying the world of nature and other civilizations.&lt;ref name=IrishTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=CHAR /&gt;&lt;ref name=cnngo.com /&gt; Maxim Osipov observed that the film's philosophical message was consistent overall with the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', a key scripture of Hinduism, in defining what constitutes real culture and civilization.&lt;ref name=HT /&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH /&gt;

=== Pantheism vs. Christianity ===
Some Christian writers worried that ''Avatar'' promotes [[pantheism]] and [[Naturalistic pantheism|nature worship]].  A critic for ''[[L’Osservatore Romano]]'' of [[the Holy See]] wrote that the film "shows a spiritualism linked to the worship of nature, a fashionable pantheism in which creator and creation are mixed up."&lt;ref name=NYThemes /&gt;&lt;ref name=VaticanR&gt;{{cite news|title=Vatican critical of Avatar's spiritual message|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2010/01/12/avatar-vatican.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rmhu221p|archivedate=2010-08-06|work=[[CBC News]]|date=January 12, 2010|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, ''[[Vatican Radio]]'' argued that the film "cleverly winks at all those pseudo-doctrines that turn ecology into the religion of the millennium.  Nature is no longer a creation to defend, but a divinity to worship."&lt;ref name=VaticanR /&gt; According to Vatican spokesman [[Federico Lombardi]], these reviews reflect [[Pope Benedict XVI|the Pope]]'s views on [[neopaganism]], or confusing nature and spirituality.&lt;ref name=VaticanR /&gt; On the other hand, disagreeing with the Vatican's characterization of ''Avatar'' as pagan, a writer in the ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'' urged Christian critics to see the film in the historical context of "Christianity's complicity in the conquest of the Americas" instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/criticism-avatar-spiritualism-base|title=Criticism of 'Avatar' spiritualism off base|last=Martinez|first=Dimentria|date=January 20, 2010|accessdate=March 3, 2010|work=[[National Catholic Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ross Douthat]], a conservative columnist of ''[[The New York Times]]'', called ''Avatar'' "the Gospel According to James" and "Cameron's long [[apologia]] for pantheism [which] has been [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s religion of choice for a generation now."&lt;ref name=hackneyed /&gt; Replying to him, [[Jay Michaelson]] of the ''[[HuffPost]]'' wrote "The Meaning of Avatar: Everything is God (A Response to Ross Douthat and other naysayers of ‘pantheism’)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Michaelson |first=Jay |authorlink=Jay Michaelson |title=The Meaning of Avatar: Everything is God (A Response to Ross Douthat and other naysayers of ‘pantheism’) |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-michaelson/the-meaning-of-avatar-eve_b_400912.html |newspaper=HuffPost |date=December 22, 2009 |accessdate=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Weekly Standard'', John Podhoretz criticized the film's "mindless worship of a nature-loving tribe and the tribe's adorable [[pagan]] rituals."&lt;ref name=TWS /&gt; Christian critic David Outten disputed that "the danger to moviegoers is that ''Avatar'' presents the Na'vi culture on Pandora as morally superior to life on Earth. If you love the philosophy and culture of the Na'vi too much, you will be led into evil rather than away from it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movieguide.org/articles/1/574/capitalism-christianity-and-avatar-by-david-outten |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rmhu222O|archivedate=2010-08-06|title=Capitalism, Christianity and Avatar|last=Outten|first=David|date=December 15, 2009|accessdate=February 13, 2010|work=movieguide.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outten further added: "Cameron has done a masterful job in manipulating the emotions of his audience in ''Avatar''. He created a world where it looks good and noble to live in a tree and hunt for your food daily with a bow and arrow.&amp;nbsp;... Cameron said, '''Avatar'' asks us to see that everything is connected, all human beings to each other, and us to the Earth.' This is a clear statement of religious belief. This is pantheism. It is not Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieguide.org/articles/1/623/avatar-wins-golden-globe-cameron-pushes-pantheism-on-tv|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rmhu222g|title= Avatar wins Golden Globe: Cameron pushes pantheism on TV|last=Outten|first=David|date=January 29, 2010|archivedate=August 6, 2010|accessdate=February 15, 2010|work=movieguide.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Christian critics wrote that ''Avatar'' has "an abhorrent [[New Age]], pagan, anti-capitalist worldview that promotes goddess worship and the destruction of the human race"&lt;ref name=CW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avatar: Get rid of human beings now!|date=December 17, 2009|accessdate=March 3, 2010|url=http://www.movieguide.org/box-office/4/10075-avatar|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5oxE6np5S|archivedate=2010-04-13|work=movieguide.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that Christian viewers interpret the film as a reminder of [[Jesus Christ]] as "the True Avatar".&lt;ref name=BolPress /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20091223/the-true-avatar/page2.html|title=The true Avatar|last=Palmer|first=Lane|work=[[The Christian Post]]|date=December 23, 2009|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them also suspected ''Avatar'' of subversive retelling of the biblical [[The Exodus|Exodus]],&lt;ref name=Waskow/&gt; by which Cameron "invites us to look at the Bible from the side of Canaanites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pui-Lan |first=Kwok |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/dispatches/culture/2168/avatar%3A_a_subversive_reading_of_the_bible |title=Avatar: A subversive reading of the Bible? |work=[[Religion Dispatches]] |date=January 10, 2010|accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, other commentators concluded that the film promotes [[theism]]&lt;ref name=TPD /&gt; or [[panentheism]]&lt;ref name=Nooz /&gt; rather than pantheism, arguing that the hero "does not pray to a tree, but through a tree to the deity whom he addresses personally" and, unlike in pantheism, "the film's deity does indeed—contrary to the native wisdom of the Na'vi—interfere in human affairs."&lt;ref name=TPD /&gt; Ann Marlowe of ''Forbes'' agreed, saying that "though ''Avatar'' has been charged with "pantheism", its mythos is just as deeply Christian."&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt; Another author suggested that the film's message "leads to a renewed reverence for the natural world—a very Christian teaching."&lt;ref name=Nooz /&gt;  Saritha Prabhu, an [[India]]n-born columnist for ''[[The Tennessean]]'', saw the film as a misportrayal of pantheism: "What pantheism is, at least, to me: a silent, spiritual awe when looking (as [[Einstein]] said) at the 'beauty and sublimity of the universe', and seeing the divine manifested in different aspects of nature. What pantheism isn't: a touchy-feely, [[kumbaya]] vibe as is often depicted. No wonder many Americans are turned off." Prabhu also criticized Hollywood and Western media for what she saw as their generally poor job of portraying [[Eastern religion|Eastern spirituality]].&lt;ref name=TENN /&gt;

'''Tonsure''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɒ|n|ʃ|ər}}) is the practice of cutting or shaving some or all of the [[hair]] on the [[scalp]], as a sign of religious devotion or humility. The term originates from the [[Latin]] word ''{{lang|la|tōnsūra}}'' (meaning "clipping" or "shearing"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0060%3Aentry%3Dtonsura |author=Charlton T. Lewis |work=An Elementary Latin Dictionary |title=tōnsūra |accessdate=August 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and referred to a specific practice in medieval [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], abandoned by papal order in 1972. Tonsure can also refer to the secular practice of shaving all or part of the scalp to show support or sympathy, or to designate mourning. Current usage more generally refers to cutting or shaving for monks, devotees, or mystics of any religion as a symbol of their renunciation of worldly fashion and esteem.

Tonsure is still a traditional practice in Catholicism by specific religious orders (with papal permission). It is also commonly used in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] for newly baptized members and is frequently used for [[Buddhist]] novices and [[Bhikkhu|monk]]s. It exists as a traditional practice in Islam after completion of the ''[[Hajj]]'' and is also practiced by a number of [[Hindu]] religious orders.

==Hinduism==
{{main|Sanskara (rite of passage)}}
[[File:Hindu baby first head shave choulopan chudakarana sanskara.jpg|thumb|A baby's first haircut, which is often a head shave, is a common rite of passage. It is called ''Caula'', ''Chudakarana'' or ''Mundana'' sanskara in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=pandeytonsure/&gt;]]
Tonsure is usually the part of three rites of passages in the life of the individual in Hinduism. The first is called [[Chudakarana]] ([[IAST]]: Cūḍākaraṇa, Sanskrit: चूडाकरण; literally, "rite of tonsure"), also known as ''choulam'', ''caula'', ''chudakarma'', or ''mundana'', marks the child's first haircut, typically the shaving of the head.&lt;ref name=marynama&gt;Mary McGee (2007), "Samskara", in ''The Hindu World'' (Editors: Mittal and Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415772273}}, pp. 342–343.&lt;/ref&gt; The mother dresses up, sometimes in her wedding [[sari]], and with the father present, the baby's head is shaved and nails trimmed, washed and dressed in new clothes.&lt;ref name=kanechou/&gt; Sometimes, a tuft of hair is left to cover the soft spot near the top of the baby's head.&lt;ref name=marynama/&gt;&lt;ref name=kanechou/&gt; Both boys and girls typically go through this ceremony, sometimes near a temple or a river, but it is not mandatory in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=pandeytonsure&gt;Rajbali Pandey (2013), ''Hindu Saṁskāras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments'', 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803961}}, pp. 94–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of Chudakarana rite of passage is the baby's cyclical step to hygiene and cleanliness.&lt;ref&gt;Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Saṁskāras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803961}}, pages 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual is typically done about the first birthday, but some texts recommend that it be completed before the third or the seventh year.&lt;ref name=kanechou/&gt; Sometimes, this ritual is combined with the rite of passage of Upanayana, initiation to formal schooling.&lt;ref name=marynama/&gt;&lt;ref name=kanechou&gt;PV Kane, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n317/mode/2up Samskara, Chapter VI], History of Dharmasastras, Vol. II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pp. 260–265&lt;/ref&gt;

The second rite of passage in Hinduism that sometimes involves tonsure is at the [[Upanayana]], the ''sanskara'' marking a child's entry into school.&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Gengnagel and Ute Hüsken (2005), Words and Deeds: Hindu and Buddhist Rituals in South Asia, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447051521}}, pages 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another rite of passage where tonsure is practiced by Hindus is after the death and completing the last rites of an immediate family member, that is father, mother, brother, sister, spouse or child. This ritual is regionally found in India among male mourners, who shave their heads as a sign of bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Weymont and Tina Rae (2006), Supporting Young People Coping with Grief, Loss and Death, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-1412913126}}, page 75&lt;/ref&gt; Until a few decades ago, many Hindu communities, especially the upper castes, forced widows to undergo the ritual of tonsure and shun good clothes and ornaments, in order to make them unattractive to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reddy|first1=P. Adinarayana (Editor)|title=Problems of widows in India|date=2004|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788176254793|pages=42,119, 124–130|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jamanadas, tonsure was originally a [[Buddhist]] custom and was adopted by Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=K. Jamanadas |title=Tirupati Balaji was a Buddhist Shrine |year=1991 |publisher=Sanjivan Publications |quote=The traditional custom of tonsures performed at Tirumalai as religious ceremony can not be viewed upon as a custom of the Brahmanic [Hindu] religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pandey and others trace the practice to Sanskrit texts dated to have been composed before the birth of Buddha, which mention tonsure as a rite of passage.&lt;ref name=pandeytonsure/&gt;&lt;ref name=kanechou/&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}
In [[Buddhism]], tonsure is a part of the rite of ''[[pabbajja]]'' and also a part of becoming a [[Monk#Buddhism|monk]] (Skt. ''Bhikshu'') or [[Bhikshuni|nun]] (Skt. ''Bhikshuni''). This involves shaving head and face. This tonsure is renewed as often as required to keep the head cleanly shaven.

==Judaism==
The purification process of the ''metzora'' (one afflicted with ''[[tzaraath]]'') involved the ritual shaving on the ''metzorah's'' entire body except for the afflicted locations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mishnah]]'' ''[[Nega'im]]'' 2:4&lt;/ref&gt;

And as the term tonsure may be used as a broad description for such hair styling of devotees as a ritual symbol of their renunciation of worldly fashion and esteem, [[Orthodox Jewish]] males do not shave the [[payot|corners of their beards or scalps]] with straight blades, as described in [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/leviticus/19-27.htm Leviticus 19:27].

==Christianity==

===History and development===
Tonsure was not widely known in antiquity. Tradition states that it originated with the disciples of Jesus, who observed the Torah command not to shave the hair around the sides of one's head ([[Shaving in Judaism|Leviticus 19:27]]). There were three forms of tonsure known in the 7th and 8th centuries:
[[File:Stone sculpture of celtic hero2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Stone carving from ancient [[Bohemia]], believed to depict the form of the Celtic tonsure (3rd century BC).]]
* The [[Eastern Roman Empire|Oriental]], which claimed the authority of Saint [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul the Apostle]] (Acts 18:18) and consisted of shaving the whole head. This was observed in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern churches]], including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. Hence [[Theodore of Tarsus]], who had acquired his learning in [[Byzantine]] [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and bore this tonsure, had to allow his hair to grow for four months before he could be tonsured after the Roman fashion, and then ordained [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] by [[Pope Vitalian]] in 668.
* The [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]], the exact shape of which is unclear from the sources, but in some way involved shaving the head from ear to ear.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{Cite journal|last= McCarthy|first= Daniel|authorlink= |year= 2003|title= On the Shape of the Insular Tonsure|journal= Celtica |volume= 24|issue= |pages= 140–167|id= |url= http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/celtica/c24/c24-140-167.pdf|accessdate=June 18, 2009 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape may have been semicircular, arcing forward from a line between the ears, but another popular suggestion, less borne out in the sources, proposes that the entire forehead was shaved back to the ears.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, pp. 147–150&lt;/ref&gt; More recently a triangular shape, with one point at the front of the head going back to a line between the ears, has been suggested.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"/&gt; The Celtic tonsure was worn in [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]] and was connected to the distinct set of practices known as [[Celtic Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; It was despised by those affiliated with the later Roman custom, who considered it [[orthodoxy|unorthodox]] and associated it with [[Simon Magus]].  However, there is no evidence to connect Simon Magus and this tradition.  All that can be said is that the very earliest Christians in the British Isles followed this more ancient tradition, which the later Roman tradition opposed. Many adherents to the Celtic tradition continued to maintain the old way well into the 8th and 9th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources have also suggested links between this tonsure and that worn by [[druids]] in the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston S., "A History of the English Speaking Peoples The Birth of Britain", Book 1, "The Island Race", 1956, Dodd, Mead and Company, New York, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carver, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Western Roman Empire|Roman]]: this consisted of shaving only the top of the head, so as to allow the hair to grow in the form of a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]]. This is claimed to have originated with [[Saint Peter]], and is the practice of the [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]].

===Ancient and medieval usage===

====Eastern Christianity====

=====Clerical tonsure=====
[[Germanus I of Constantinople|St. Germanus I]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] from 715 to 730, writes "The double crown inscribed on the head of the priest through tonsure represents the precious head of the chief-apostle Peter.  When he was sent out in the teaching and preaching of the Lord, his head was shaved by those who did not believe his word, as if in mockery.  The Teacher Christ blessed this head, changed dishonor into honor, ridicule into praise.  He placed on it a crown made not out of precious stones, but one which shines more than gold, topaz, or precious stone &amp;ndash; with the stone and rock of faith. In the Eastern Orthodox Church today, priests, deacons, readers, and other tonsured offices do not have their heads shaved. Rather, four locks of hair are clipped from the top of the head in the shape of a cross to mark their obedience to the Church.

=====Monastic tonsure=====
St. Germanus I writes "The total tonsuring of the head is in imitation of the holy Apostle James, brother of the Lord, and the Apostle Paul, and of the rest."&lt;ref&gt;St. Germanus:69&lt;/ref&gt;

====Western Christianity====
[[File:Carlo Crivelli 052.jpg|thumb|right|150px|St Bartholomew (by [[Carlo Crivelli]], 1473, in the [[Ascoli Piceno Cathedral]])]]

=====Clerical tonsure=====
In the [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin or Western Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], "first tonsure"  was, in medieval times, and generally through 1972,&lt;ref name=Motu_Poprio&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P6MINORS.HTM] "motu proprio", Retrieved 2011-08-14&lt;/ref&gt; the rite of inducting someone into the [[clergy]] and qualifying him for the civil benefits once enjoyed by [[cleric]]s. Tonsure was a prerequisite for receiving the [[minor orders|minor]] and [[major orders]]. Failing to maintain tonsure was the equivalent of attempting to abandon one's clerical state, and in the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]], any cleric in minor orders (or simply tonsured) who did not resume the tonsure within a month after being warned by his [[Ordinary (officer)|Ordinary]], lost the clerical state. Over time, the appearance of tonsure varied, ending up for non-monastic clergy as generally consisting of a symbolic cutting of a few tufts of hair at first tonsure in the Sign of the Cross and in wearing a bare spot on the back of the head which varied according to the degree of orders. It was not supposed to be less than the size of a communicant's [[Host (liturgy)|host]], even for a tonsuratus, someone simply tonsured, and the approximate size for a priest's tonsure was the size of a priest's host. Countries that were not [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] had exceptions to this rule, especially in the English-speaking world. In England and [[Americas|America]], for example, the bare spot was dispensed with, likely because of the persecutions that could arise from being a part of the Catholic clergy, but the ceremonious cutting of the hair in the first clerical tonsure was always required. In accordance with [[Pope Paul VI]]'s ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Ministeria quaedam'' of 15 August 1972, "first tonsure is no longer conferred".&lt;ref name=Motu_Poprio/&gt;

=====Monastic tonsure=====
Apart from this general clerical tonsure, some [[Latin liturgical rites|Western Rite]] monastic orders, for example [[Carthusian]]s and [[Trappist]]s, employed a very full version of tonsure, shaving the head entirely bald and keeping only a narrow ring of short hair, sometimes called "the monastic crown" (see "Roman tonsure", above), from the time of entrance into the monastic [[novitiate]] for all monks, whether destined for service as priests or brothers.

===Contemporary practice===
====Eastern Christianity====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Prayer rope]] --&gt;
[[File:TonsureOfOthodoxReader.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|Clerical tonsure (note the scissors in the bishop's hands) of an Orthodox man in conjunction with ordination to [[minor orders]].]]

Today in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] of [[Byzantine Rite]], there are three types of tonsure:  [[baptism]]al, [[monk|monastic]], and [[ordination|clerical]].  It always consists of the cutting of four locks of hair in a cruciform pattern: at the front of head as the celebrant says "In the Name of the Father", at the back of head at the words "and the Son", and on either side of the head at the words "and the Holy Spirit".  In all cases, the hair is allowed to grow back; the tonsure as such is not adopted as a hairstyle.

=====Baptismal tonsure=====
Baptismal tonsure is performed during the rite of [[Holy Baptism]] as a first [[sacrifice|sacrificial]] offering by the newly baptized. This tonsure is always performed, whether the one being baptized is an infant or an adult.

=====Monastic tonsure=====
Monastic tonsure (of which there are three grades: [[Rassophore#Eastern Orthodox monks|Rassophore]], [[Stavrophore]] and the [[Great Schema]]), is the rite of initiation into the monastic state, symbolic of cutting off of self-will. Orthodox monks traditionally never cut their hair or beards after receiving the monastic tonsure as a sign of the consecration of their lives to God (reminiscent of the Vow of the [[Nazirite]]).

=====Clerical tonsure=====
Clerical tonsure is the equivalent of the "first tonsure" in the Latin church.  It is done immediately prior to ordination to the minor order of [[reader (liturgy)|reader]] but is not repeated at subsequent ordinations.&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Latin liturgical rites|West]], the [[minor orders]] were those of [[Ostiarius|porter]], [[reader (liturgy)|lector]], [[exorcist]] and [[acolyte]], and the [[major orders]] were [[subdeacon|subdiaconate]], [[deacon|diaconate]] and [[priest]]hood, with the rank of [[bishop]] usually being considered a fuller form of priesthood. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|East]], the minor orders are those of reader and [[subdeacon]], (and, in some places, acolyte); the orders of doorkeeper (porter) and exorcist (catechist) now having fallen into disuse.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a once common usage that one was, for instance, "tonsured a reader", although technically the tonsure occurs prior to the prayer of ordination within the ordination rite.

====Western Christianity====

=====Clerical tonsure=====
Since the issuing of ''Ministeria quaedam'' in 1972,&lt;ref name=Motu_Poprio/&gt; certain institutes have been authorized to use the first clerical tonsure, such as the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]] (1988), the [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]] (1990), and the [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney]] (2001).

Although the tonsure itself is obsolete, the wearing of a skull cap, called a [[zuchetto]], in church to keep the head warm, which the fuller form of clerical tonsure led to, still survives.  The zuchetto is worn by the [[pope]] (in white), [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] (in red) and [[bishop]]s (in purple) both during and outside of formal religious ceremonies. Priests may wear a simple black zuchetto, only outside of religious services, though this is almost never seen except on abbots, who continue to wear the black zuchetto; save for abbots of the Order of Canons Regular of Premontre, who wear white. Another congregation of Canons Regular, the Canons Regular of the Lateran, wear a white zuchetto as part of their proper habit. Some priests who held special titles (certain ranks of [[monsignori]] and some canons, for instance) formerly wore black zuchettos with red or purple piping, but this too has fallen out of use except in a few, extremely rare cases.

=====Monastic tonsure=====
Some monastic orders and individual monasteries still maintain the tradition of a monastic tonsure. While not required, it is still a common practice of Latin Rite friars, such as the [[Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word]]. Some references compare the tonsure to the crown of thorns worn by Christ at the crucifixion.

==Islam==
=== Sunni ===
Partial tonsure is forbidden in Islam. Muhammad forbade shaving one's hair on some parts of the head while letting it grow on other parts, as in tonsure. However, shaving the head entirely is allowed. The proscription is detailed in the [[hadith]].

&lt;blockquote lang=ar dir=rtl&gt;عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ – صلى الله عليه وسلم – نَهَى عَنِ الْقَزَعِ&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From Ibnu 'Umar (he says), the Prophet – peace be upon him – forbids the Qoza‘ (i.e. shaving hair on some parts of the head while let it grow on other parts). 
Hadith Bukhori V/2214 no.5577 about ''Al-Qoza‘'', and Hadith Muslim III/1675 no.2120, about ''the Proscription of Al-Qoza‘''){{primary source inline|date=July 2017}}

&lt;blockquote lang=ar dir=rtl&gt; عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ رَأَى النَّبِي صَلَّى الله عَلَيهِ وَسَلَّمَ صَبِياًً قَدْ حلقَ بَعْضَ شَعْرٍ رَأسَه وَ تركَ بَعْضاً فقال: اَحلِقْهُ كُلَّهُ أَوْ دَعْهُ كُلَّهُ &lt;/blockquote&gt;

From Ibnu 'Umar (he says), the Prophet – peace be upon him – saw a boy whose head shaven on some parts and let the hair grow on other parts. Then, the Prophet commands, "Shave the head entirely or let the hair grow entirely" 
Hadith Ahmad II/88, Hadith Abu Dawud no. 4195, and Hadith An-Nasa-i no.5048){{primary source inline|date=July 2017}}

==Secular European==

===Merovingians===
Among the [[Merovingians]], whose rulers were the "long-haired kings",&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory of Tours]]' ''reges criniti''&lt;/ref&gt; the ancient custom remained that an unsuccessful [[pretender]] or a dethroned king would be tonsured. Then he had to retire to a monastery, but sometimes this lasted only until his hair grew back.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory of Tours, ''History of the Franks'', II.41.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus [[Grimoald the Elder]], the son of [[Pippin of Landen]], and [[Dagobert II]]'s guardian, seized the throne for his own son and had Dagobert tonsured, thus marking him unfit for kingship,&lt;ref&gt;J. Hoyaux, "Reges criniti: chevelures, tonsures et scalps chez les Mérovingiens," ''[[Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire]]'', 26 (1948)]; [[J. M. Wallace-Hadrill]], ''The Long-Haired Kings and Other Essays'' (London, 1962:154ff).&lt;/ref&gt; and exiled.&lt;ref&gt;See also Conrad Leyser, "Long-haired kings and short-haired nuns: writing on the body in Caesarius of Arles", ''Studia patristica'' '''24''' 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine Empire===
The practice of tonsure, coupled with castration, was common for deposed emperors and their sons in Byzantium from around the 8th century, prior to which disfigurement, usually by blinding, was the normal practice.&lt;ref&gt;Byzantium by John Julius Norwich Published by Viking 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
The early [[Jain]] contemplated the nature of the earth and universe and developed a detailed hypothesis on the various aspects of astronomy and [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]]. According to the Jain texts, the universe is divided into 3 parts:{{Sfn|Grimes|1996|p=177}}{{Sfn|Titze|Bruhn|1998|p=238}}{{Sfn|Wiley|2009|p=131}}{{Sfn|Raval|2016|p=81}}
* ''Urdhva [[Loka]]'' – the realms of the [[Deva (Jainism)|gods]] or heavens
* ''[[Madhya Loka]]'' – the realms of the [[humans]], [[animals]] and [[plants]]
* ''[[Naraka (Jainism)|Adho Loka]]'' – the [[Naraka (Jainism)|realms of the hellish beings]] or the infernal regions

'''Ulavi''' ({{Lang-kn| ಉಳವಿ }}) is a village in the [[Uttara Kannada district]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ulavi Population - Uttara Kannada, Karnataka |website=Census 2011 |url=http://www.census2011.co.in/data/village/602746-ulavi-karnataka.html |accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulavi is a village about {{convert|75|km}} from [[Karwar]] (via Kumbarawada) in [[Karnataka]] state, [[India]].

Ulavi is an important center of pilgrimage for people of the [[Lingayat]] faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Patil |first=Shankaragouda Hanamantagouda |year=2002 |title=Community Dominance and Political Modernisation: The Lingayats |publisher=Mittal Publications |page=397 |isbn=9788170998679}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Samadhi'' of [[Channabasavanna]], one of the most revered saints of the [[Lingayat]] faith lies here.  In the 12th century, Channabasavanna traveled from [[Basavakalyana|Kalyana]] to Ulavi before he died. Very close to this holy ''Samadhi'' is the ''Akka Nagalambike'' cave named after Nagalambike, Channabasavanna's mother and [[Basavanna]]'s sister.  The Ulavi ''jathre'' or congregations attracts pilgrims from all over [[Karnataka]].

Ulavi is located at western ghatts. Thick forests here hold tiger, cheeta, elephant, sarang, cobra, and other wildlife.

The closest settlements are Dandeli, Dharwad, Hubli. Three daily buses serve the village via Dharwad from Hubli, Chitradurga, Haveri and Belgum.

Other local areas of interest include Sintheri Rock, Kali River, Anashi Reserve Forest, Supa Dam.

'''''When Religion Becomes Evil''''' is a book by [[Baptist]] minister Charles Kimball, published in 2002. Kimball is a Professor in the Department of Religion at [[Wake Forest University]] and also an Adjunct Professor in the Wake Forest Divinity School. In 2008, he became director of Religious Studies at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. Kimball specialises in Islamic Studies.

''When Religion Becomes Evil'' examines the role of religion in the world and when it defects from its original purpose. While he claims that religion is basically necessary and positive, he ascribes several warning signs for when religions can become dangerous.

Kimball lists five warning signs of a religion becoming [[evil]]. These are also his main chapter titles and appear on the back cover of the book.
* Absolute Truth Claims
* Blind Obedience
* Establishing the "Ideal" Time
* The End Justifies Any Means
* Declaring Holy War

Using his five warning signs, Kimball analyzes what religion is, why he believes we need it, and how we can fix something when it goes wrong.

[[Image:Church of Scientology building in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California.jpeg|thumb|Headquarters of the World Institute of Scientology Enterprises International in Los Angeles]]
'''World Institute of Scientology Enterprises''' ('''WISE''') is a [[Church of Scientology]] organization headquartered in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. It states that it is an "international membership organization whose members use both L. Ron Hubbard management technology and embrace the responsibilities and ethical standards of WISE membership."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wise.org/en_US/membership/about/index.html|title=About WISE|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the history of Scientology, Hubbard said about the early Churches of Scientology:  "They are not business and so fail when they try to operate like one". He then began creating a new system of organizing these churches with the stated purpose of "Disseminating Scientology to the world." This new system was modified continually until circa 1980. In the late 60s, a project began compiling his notes into hard bound volumes that later became known as the Organization Executive Course or OEC. Originally intended as a training program for church executives (hence the name),  Hubbard later made them available to all church staff and stated that all staff should train on them.

However the OEC was stated to work for any kind of organization if understood. Business not connected to the church wishing to improve their own success reportedly began hiring trained church staff in the 70s causing problems in the church. In the 1980s Hubbard created WISE with the intention of giving any non-church related organization a means to train their own staff so that Scientology churches and [[Scientology Missions International|missions]] could train their staff without fear of losing them to other groups. {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

WISE was officially incorporated in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wise.org/en_US/membership/about/pg003.html The Growth of WISE]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
*WISE headquarters are located in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], 6331 Hollywood Blvd, in the Hollywood Guaranty Building. The corporate executives of WISE belong to the [[Sea Org]] of the [[Church of Scientology]].
*[[Hubbard College of Administration International]], which provides a "Degree program for an Associate of Applied Science Degree of Management and Administration", is located at 320 North Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, California.
*WISE regional offices, which are at [[Church of Scientology]] locations, coordinate the local level Charter Committees.
*Charter Committees of established members in local areas provide guidance and dispute mediation between WISE members instead of using the civil courts.
*Hubbard Management Consultants are WISE members licensed to sell services, seminars, training and courses based on Admin Tech and to encourage their clients to become WISE members. Consultants are encouraged to compete in the "WISE Consultant Expansion Game" with weekly standings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WISE Consultant Expansion Game |work=Hubbard Management Consultants |url=http://www.wise.org/articles/602211438511.vm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509165001/http://www.wise.org/articles/602211438511.vm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-05-09 |date=2006-06-27 |accessdate=2006-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; WISE consultants include "MasterTech Computer Products", [[Sterling Management Systems]], Survival Strategies Inc., Management Success and [[David Singer (chiropractor)|David Singer Enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/50162617.html?dids=50162617:50162617&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Nov+29%2C+1987&amp;author=STEPHEN+KOFF&amp;pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1.B&amp;desc=Chiropractors+seeking+advice+find+Scientology-influenced+seminars |title = Chiropractors seeking advice find Scientology-influenced seminars |accessdate = 2007-08-04 |last =  Koff |first = Stephen |date = 1987-09-29 |work = [[St. Petersburg Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==

Membership in WISE means that the owner(s) of the firm have embraced Hubbard's administrative ideas such as management by statistics and the Org board and have agreed to abide by a certain Code of Ethics which includes arbitration by a WISE mediator of any disputes with another WISE member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wise.org/en_US/membership/about/index.html|title=About WISE|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is the basic company membership. If the firm also wants to train its employees in the Hubbard administrative technology using WISE materials then they become a higher-level member by paying a pre-determined amount of money to WISE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wise.org/en_US/membership/join/index.html WISE — World Institute of Scientology Enterprises]&lt;/ref&gt; Some employees and prospective employees have objected to this formal training in that it is something that is also a part of Scientology and a number have filed discrimination lawsuits with mixed results.

WISE Members include e-Republic, which publishes ''Government Technology'' and ''Converge'' magazines and coordinates the ''Center for Digital Government''.  Other affiliated firms include various "alternative health" centers including "The Natural Health Centre" in Redondo Beach, CA which is owned and operated by Dr. Grace Syn. WISE ANZO members include Gallop Solutions based in Sydney, Australia.

==Lawsuits==
A number of firms use the WISE administrative technology in their practices and there have been a number of civil suits and discrimination cases brought by employees objecting to the material with mixed results:
* In 2009, a former dental assistant reported a dentist to the [[Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries]] for religious discrimination after she felt pressured to attend a Scientology conference. In 2012, the dentist paid nearly $348,000 to settle the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Molly|title=Bend dentist fined nearly $348,000 for required Scientology-based training, BOLI announces|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/money/index.ssf/2012/10/bend_dentist_fined_nearly_3480.html|accessdate=9 January 2013|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 2008, two former employees of [[Diskeeper]], a WISE member,&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Talk:World_Institute_of_Scientology_Enterprises_International_Business_Directory,_text,_2006 Wikileaks.org] World Institute of Scientology Enterprises International Business Directory 2006&lt;/ref&gt; sued the company for being dismissed for refusing to participate in Scientology training courses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/22/scientology_diskeeper_lawsuit/ The Register] Scientology refuseniks sue over compulsory workplace courses. December 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] filed a federal lawsuit against dentist K. Mike Dossett of [[Plano, Texas]], on behalf of Dossett's former receptionist, Jessica Uretsky. The suit alleges that Uretsky was pressured to study Scientology during mandatory meetings on her own time, and was told to "increase business by concentrating on her phone to make it ring".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/scientology/history/history111.html Rick A. Ross Institute] Dentist denies forcing Scientology on worker, as suit alleges. October 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2005, dentist Daniel Stewart and his Smile Savers Dentistry in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] were sued by former employee Tammy Bright. She accused her employer of religious discrimination for failure to adapt her religious beliefs to Scientology. Devora Lindeman, Stewart's attorney who is also a Scientologist herself, denied the allegations and said Bright was fired for "poor performance." &lt;ref&gt;"Woman claims she was fired unfairly over Scientology" by Laura Cadiz, The ''Baltimore Sun'', March 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2003, three former employees of [[Aurora, Ohio]] dentist C. Aydin Cabi asserted in court that Dr. Cabi dismissed them from their jobs for their refusal to take part in Sterling Management's Scientology-based seminars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040121003001/http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~skent/Linkedfiles/ohiodentist.htm EXPERT REPORT ON THE CASE OF DIANA KOSTELNY, JERRY KOSTELNY, GAIL EBERHARDT, CARL EBERHARDT, MELANIE POST (FORMERLY GRANT) AND GREGORY R. POST v. C. AYDIN CABI, DDS, INC] Stephen A. Kent , September 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2002, The U.S. [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]  filed a lawsuit on behalf of former employees of dentist Juan Villareal and Harlingen Family Dentistry in [[Harlingen, Texas]] who refused to attend Scientology training courses.&lt;ref&gt;"EEOC: Employees illegally fired" by Allen Essex, ''Valley Morning Star'', Friday, September 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1998, dentist Roger N. Carlsten was sued for religious discrimination in the workplace by former employee Susan Morgan, who alleged in court that she was fired for refusing to take a Scientology-filled Hubbard Administrative Technology "statistics" course. A [[Rhode Island]] [[Superior Court]] jury, however, cleared the dentist of the charges.&lt;ref&gt;''Dentist cleared in bias lawsuit''; The Providence Journal, Providence, R.I., Author: KAREN LEE ZINER Journal Staff Writer, Date: January 29, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1994, Christina M. Goudeau of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] filed suit against Landmark Dental Care. Goudeau reported she was fired because she was expected to join the Church of Scientology, and to use Scientology practices and terminology in the office.&lt;ref&gt;"Suit blames Scientology for firing" by Fred Kalmbach, The ''Advocate''  [Baton Rouge], June 16, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1992, two former assistants of dentist Lyn V. Bates filed suit in [[Canton, Ohio]], claiming they "were continually, against their will, subjected to religious recruitment, proselytizing and brainwashing by defendants in fervent attempts to convert them to the Scientology cult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knox|first=David|title=Dental assistants say firing result of their rejection of Scientology|url=http://www.xenu-directory.net/documents/corporate/stop-wise.biz/SMS_dental_assistants_fired.html|accessdate=9 January 2013|newspaper=Akron Beacon Journal|date=2 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Vision United States''' is a member and founding organization of [[World Vision International]]. Founded in the United States in 1950, it is an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]]&lt;ref&gt;D. Michael Lindsay (2007): Faith in the halls of power: how evangelicals joined the American elite. New York: Oxford University Press. S. 44f.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Humanitarian aid|relief]] and [[Social development|development]] organization whose stated goal is "to follow our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in working with the poor and oppressed to promote human transformation, seek justice and bear witness to the good news of the Kingdom of God."&lt;ref name="ourmission"&gt;[http://www.worldvision.org/content.nsf/about/our-mission?Open&amp;lpos=lft_txt_Our-Mission Our Mission], World Vision, Retrieved July 21st, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is  one of the largest relief and development organizations in the USA with a 1.6 billion dollar budget (2007).

== History ==
World Vision was founded in 1950 by Dr. [[Robert Pierce]] ("Bob"), a young American evangelist pastor, who had first been sent to China and [[South Korea]] in 1947 by the [[Youth for Christ]] missionary organization. Pierce remained at the head of World Vision for nearly two decades, but resigned from the organization in 1967.

On his trip he was inspired by the poverty of one little girl to pledge a monthly amount to the girl's local church to ensure her care. This generated the idea of [[child sponsorship]] and World Vision.&lt;ref name="WV History"&gt;[http://www.worldvision.org/content.nsf/about/history World Vision History], retrieved April 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the organization  focused on   orphans and other children in need, beginning in South Korea, then expanding throughout [[Asia]]. The program soon spread throughout Latin America, eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In the 1960s, the group started providing food, clothing, and medical care to citizens of impoverished countries after natural disasters by soliciting donations from major corporations.&lt;ref name="WV History"/&gt;

From 1966 onward, the organization used in business also the name  "World Vision International"&lt;ref&gt;United States Patent Office 3. Okt. 1972, no. #944238.&lt;/ref&gt; but from 1977 on this name was reserved for the umbrella organisation [[World Vision International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manta.com/c/mmghym3/world-vision-intl www.manta.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wvi.org/wvi/wviweb.nsf/maindocs/39F905AE21E265C1882573750075074B?opendocument&lt;/ref&gt; and the founding organization as a member of World Vision International is called World Vision United States whenever a distinction is necessary.

Later, [[Richard Stearns (World Vision)|Richard Stearns]] became president of World Vision US. On January 9, 2018, it was announced that Rich would be retiring from the organization after nearly 20 years as President.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldvision.org/about-us/media-center/world-vision-us-president-rich-stearns-to-retire]&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2018, it was announced that Edgar Sandoval would replace Rich as World Vision's new President and CEO beginning October 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldvision.org/about-us/media-center/world-vision-u-s-names-edgar-sandoval-as-new-president]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
[[File:World Vision US Headquarters.jpg|thumb|200px|left|main office in the World Vision US headquarters office complex in [[Federal Way, Washington]]]]
World Vision US is an independently registered interdependent national member office of the federal umbrella organization World Vision International. The relationship with the central organization is governed by the "Covenant of Partnership", that all national members  sign. It provides that the national organizations must accept policies and decisions  of the umbrella organization.  and must not establish an office or program outside the US without the consent of the central group and the host country. Furthermore, except for  direct project founding, all funds used outside the US have to be remitted through the central organization, and its  financial   and budget principles must be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Appendix D, "A Covenant of Partnership" in Greame Irvine: "Best Things in the Worst Times: An Insiders View of World Vision" BookPartners, Inc. (1996) {{ISBN|1-885221-37-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the national group must  also subscribes to the core values, the mission statement, and the Statement of Faith of World Vision.&lt;ref&gt;The Statement of Faith of World Vision {{cite web |url=http://www.worldvision.org/content.nsf/about/hr-faith |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303231437/http://www.worldvision.org/content.nsf/about/hr-faith |archivedate=2011-03-03 |df= }} corresponds to the Statement of Faith put forward by the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE)[http://www.nae.net/about-us/statement-of-faith] as standard for their evangelical convictions [http://www.nae.net/church-and-faith-partners/what-is-an-evangelical]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spirituality==
World Vision aims to incorporate Christian belief into their development work as well as their organization. US president [[Richard Stearns (World Vision)|Richard Stearns]] stated that the group has a strict policy against [[proselytizing]], which he describes as "... - using any kind of coercion or inducement to listen to a religious message before helping someone."&lt;ref name="Richard Stearns interview"&gt;Stearns, Richard. "World Vision CEO Richard Stearns Charts Course, Spirit For Nonprofit Sector ." Huffington Post 3 Mar. 2011: 1-2. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Like all other national members of the World Vision Partnership, World Vision US is committed to the concept of  transformational development,&lt;ref&gt;"World Vision Mission Statement." In: Greame Irvine: "Best Things in the Worst Times: An Insiders View of World Vision", BookPartners, Inc. (1996) {{ISBN|1-885221-37-1}}, Appendix C.&lt;/ref&gt; which is cast in a biblical framework and in which [[evangelization]] is an inseparable integral part of development work.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Bryant L. Myer: "Walking with the Poor: Principles and Practice of Transformational Development" {{ISBN|1-57075-275-3}} (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Stearns  stated that "hope" is World Vision's most lasting impression. He believes that if hope can be restored in a community it is more beneficial than adding a water well. He emphasizes that everyone lives in a religious world where more than 90% of the population believes in some faith. He claims that World Vision's understanding of faith is essential for development.&lt;ref name="Richard Stearns interview"/&gt;

==Funding==
World Vision uses the [[child sponsorship|Sponsor a Child]] method of fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/world/middleeast/worldvision-palestinians-sponsor-a-child.html|title=A World Vision Donor Sponsored a Boy. The Outcome Was a Mystery to Both.|date=August 3, 2016|author=Diaa Hadid|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals, families, churches, schools, and other groups sponsor specific children or specific community projects in their own country or abroad. Sponsors send funds each month, supposedly to provide support for the sponsored children or projects.

According to its annual report, in 2008 87% of its funding was spent on programs, 8% on fundraising and 5% on management and general overhead.&lt;ref name="annreport08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvision.org/resources.nsf/main/PRES08832_OVB.pdf/$file/PRES08832_OVB.pdf |title=World Vision - Full 2008 Annual Financial Statement in PDF |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=P.O. Box 9716 |url=http://www.worldvision.org/content.nsf/about/ar-financials?Open |title=2008 Annual Review |publisher=World Vision |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
[[File:World Vision bldg Walnut Av 138 St Pt Morris jeh.jpg|thumb|[[South Bronx]]]]
World Vision provides emergency relief to people whose lives are endangered by disasters or conflict and who need immediate assistance. It attempts to respond to all major emergencies around the world themselves or in cooperation with partner agencies. For example, World Vision responded to famine&lt;ref&gt;Costello, Tim, et al., [http://www.worldvision.com.au/media/opinionpieces/08-12-10/Freedom_from_hunger_the_most_basic_of_human_rights.aspx Freedom from hunger: the most basic of human rights, Opinion Piece] - World Vision Australia, posted: 10 Dec 2008, Authors: Tim Costello (World Vision), Julia Newton-Howes (CARE), Paul O'Callaghan (ACFID), Jack de Groot (Caritas), Andrew Hewett (Oxfam), and Robert Tickner (Red Cross).&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ethiopia]] and [[North Korea]], hurricanes in [[Central America]], the [[Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami in the Indian Ocean nations]], earthquakes in [[El Salvador]], India, [[Taiwan]], [[Turkey]] and the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|Sichuan earthquake]] in China, [[Cyclone Nargis]] in [[Myanmar]] and war refugees in [[Kosovo]], [[Chechnya]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Angola]], and [[East Timor]].

The organization encourages public awareness about the needs of others, the causes of poverty, and the nature of compassionate response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldvision.org/content.nsf/learn/globalissues-action?Open&amp;lpos=ctr_txt_AdvocacyActionCenter Advocacy action center], World Vision, Retrieved July 21st, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts include collaboration with media and community participation in fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/org10/012/2008/en/ - Amnesty International Press Center], Document of Public Statement Issued by CEOs of INGOs on the impact of the global economic downturn – '''October 2008''', Authors: Irene Khan, Secretary General, [[Amnesty International]], Jeremy Hobbs, Executive Director, [[Oxfam International]], Dr. Dean Hirsch, Chief Executive Officer, [[World Vision International]], Tom Miller, Chief Executive Officer, [[PLAN International]], Gerd Leipold, International Executive Director, [[Greenpeace]], Dr Robert Glasser, Secretary General, [[CARE International]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization devotes considerable effort to advocating to the US government.  On March 1, 2011, along with 29 other faith-based groups, it sent a letter to the senate petitioning for the restoration of cuts made to foreign disaster assistance, global health, and food aid in the 2011 budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.one.org/c/us/pressrelease/3691/] - ONE Press Release&lt;/ref&gt;

World Vision is a leading member of the [[U.S. Global Leadership Coalition]], a Washington D.C.-based coalition of over 400 major companies and [[NGO]]s that advocates for a larger international affairs budget, which funds American diplomatic and development efforts abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usglc.org/about/our-coalition U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, Global Trust members]&lt;/ref&gt; World Vision is also a member of the [[Global Coalition Against Pneumonia]] and supports [[World Pneumonia Day]] on November 2, 2009.

== Criticism ==
In 1999, the academic journal ''Development in Practice'' published an overview of World Vision's history focusing on the evolution of its global architecture.  The document, "Pursuing Partnership: World Vision and the Ideology of Development" was written by then World Vision staff person Alan Whaites, who went on to become a   political scientist concerned with international development.  He offered a picture of an organization that was often spurred to innovate and change as a result of internal reflection on external criticism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.developmentinpractice.org/journals/pursuing-partnership-world-vision-and-ideology-development-case-study&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrimination in hiring===
In August 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled that "World Vision is a 'religious corporation' and therefore exempt from  federal law barring faith-based discrimination, and thus was  permitted to dismiss two employees who were fired because they did not believe in the "divinity of Jesus or the doctrine of the Trinity." Judge [[Marsha S. Berzon]] of that circuit dissented, arguing that "Congress did not intend to allow all religiously motivated nonprofits to be exempt from the law." She believes that the decision discriminates against employees who have the ability to do the assigned work just because of their religious views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2010-09/world-vision-wins-right-hire-and-fire-faith-basis The Christian Century: ''World Vision wins right to hire and fire on faith basis'', August 31, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex marriage===

On March 24, 2014, the World Vision US announced that it would hire what it defined as Christians in [[same-sex marriage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aleteia.org/en/religion/article/is-this-the-future-of-same-sex-marriage-for-evangelicals-5260937284026368 |title=Is This the Future of Same-Sex Marriage for Evangelicals? |publisher=Aleteia |date= |accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing protests from donors and the larger [[evangelical Christianity|evangelical]] community after the announcement, World Vision reversed the policy change two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/03/26/world-vision-reverses-decision-to-hire-christians-in-same-sex-marriages/ |title=World Vision reverses decision to hire Christians in same-sex marriages |publisher=Fox News |date= |accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/march-web-only/world-vision-reverses-decision-gay-same-sex-marriage.html |title=World Vision Reverses Decision to Hire Christians in Same-Sex Marriages |publisher=Christianity Today |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
