'''''16 Blocks''''' is a 2006 American [[action thriller]] film directed by [[Richard Donner]] and starring [[Bruce Willis]], [[Mos Def]], and [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]. The film unfolds in the [[real time (media)|real time]] narration method. It is Donner's final directorial effort, as he retired the same year the film was released.
== Plot ==
Jack Mosley ([[Bruce Willis]]) is an alcoholic, burned-out [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] detective. Despite a late shift the night before, his lieutenant orders him to escort a witness, Eddie Bunker ([[Mos Def]]), from local custody to the courthouse 16 blocks away to testify on a police corruption case before a grand jury at 10 a.m. Bunker tries to be friendly with Mosley, telling him of his aspirations to move to Seattle to become a cake baker with his sister who he has never met, but Mosley is uninterested, and stops at a liquor store. They are suddenly ambushed by a gunman, and Mosley drags Bunker to a local bar to take shelter and call for backup. Mosley's former partner, Frank Nugent ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]), and several other officers arrive. Nugent and his men are part of the corruption scheme, and he tells Mosley that Bunker is not worth defending as his testimony will likely expose several corrupt officers, including Nugent. The corrupt cops try to frame Bunker for firing at an officer before they try to kill him. Mosley intervenes, rescuing Bunker and fleeing.

Mosley briefly stops at his sister Diane's ([[Jenna Stern]]) apartment to retrieve guns and ammo, and learns the police have already approached her about his activities earlier that day. He and Bunker take steps to further elude the police, and Mosley is wounded in the process.  They become cornered in a run-down apartment building as Nugent and his men search floor by floor. Mosley calls the district attorney to arrange for help, but purposely gives the wrong apartment number, suspecting there is a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] involved. Mosley and Bunker are able to escape onto a passenger bus, and as the police follow them, Mosley is forced to treat the passengers as hostages. The bus crashes into a construction site and is soon surrounded by the [[New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit|ESU]]. Aware that Nugent will likely order the ESU to raid the bus, risking the safety of the passengers, Mosley allows the passengers to go free, using their cover to allow Bunker to sneak off the bus in the confusion.  Mosley finds a tape recorder in the discarded possessions on the bus, and prepares a farewell message to Diane.

To his surprise, Bunker returns to the bus; while Nugent is ready to fire on him, Nugent is made to stand down by a superior officer. Bunker has come to see Mosley as his friend and wants to be there for him to see this through. Bunker's tenacity convinces Mosley to get to the courthouse, and he manages to drive the bus into an alley, temporarily blocking the police from following them. He finds that Bunker has been wounded, and calls Diane, a [[paramedic]], to bring an ambulance around to help, despite knowing she will be followed. Diane cares for Mosley and Bunker's wounds, though Bunker still needs further treatment at a hospital. As Diane's ambulance drives away, the police stop her but discover the ambulance is empty; she had a second ambulance pick up Mosley and Bunker that would not be under similar surveillance. Meanwhile, Mosley reveals to Bunker that should he testify, not only will Nugent be convicted but so would Mosley as one of the corrupt cops. Mosley gets off a block from the courthouse and wishes Bunker luck with his bakery, instructing the paramedic to take Bunker to the Port Authority and put him on a bus for Seattle. Bunker promises to send him a cake on his birthday.

Mosley continues to the courthouse, where the police and ESU are waiting for him, as well as the district attorney. Mosley enters the courthouse building through the underground garage, encountering Nugent alone, who tries unsuccessfully to dissuade him from testifying in Bunker's place. Mosley enters the courthouse proper, where one of Nugent's men ([[David Zayas]]) tries to shoot Mosley but is killed by one of the ESU snipers. Mosley informs the district attorney that he will testify in exchange for Bunker having his record expunged, also revealing that he had recorded the conversation with Nugent in the garage on the tape recorder, which he submits as evidence.

Two years later, Mosley is freed from prison. He celebrates his birthday with Diane and other friends, and is surprised to find that the cake had indeed come from Bunker, who has been successful in starting "Eddie &amp; Jack's Good Sign Bakery" in Seattle.

'''''Bears Can't Run Downhill''''' is a book by [[Robert Anwood]] published in 2006 by [[Ebury Press]]. It popularises the idea of [[pub facts]]. It is written to investigate (and thereby debunk or confirm) commonly held beliefs such as "One [[aging in dogs|dog year]] equals seven human years" and "In the UK, it is illegal to [[money burning|burn money]]."

It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Emus Can't Walk Backwards]]'', published in September 2007.

'''Bieten''', '''Laubbieten''' or '''Bavarian Poker''' ({{lang-de|Bayrischer Pocker}}){{sfn|Sirch|2008|p=72}} is a [[card game]] that is popular in the Austrian [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and the [[Bavarian Prealps]]. It used to be a game frequently played by [[timber rafter]]s and [[muleteer]]s. It can be seen as a precursor to the traditional Tyrolean game of [[Perlaggen]]. The unusual feature of Bieten is the nature of the [[competition]]. The players have the option, even if they have a poor hand, of persuading their opponent(s) to cave in through skilful bidding (''Bieten'') and [[bluffing]]. 

== Aim ==
The aim of each hand is to score points by winning certain 'figures'.&lt;ref name=Auer50/&gt;

== Cards ==
[[German playing cards]] are used for Bieten. It is usually played by 2 or more players, without partnerships, but 3 or 4 players works best.&lt;ref name=Auer50/&gt; Of the standard deck of 36 cards, the 6 of [[Acorns (card suit)|Acorns]], [[Leaves (card suit)|Leaves]] and [[Hearts (card suit)|Hearts]] are removed, leaving only the 6 of [[Bells (card suit)|Bells]], the ''[[Weli]]'', in play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(Laub-)Bieten: Vom großen Bluff und der besten Figur|periodical=|publisher=Statistik Austria|url=http://www.br.de/radio/bayern2/sendungen/zeit-fuer-bayern/bieten100.html|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2014-04-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706053958/http://www.br.de/radio/bayern2/sendungen/zeit-fuer-bayern/bieten100.html|archivedate=2013-07-06|last=Rauch, Anton and Susanne Schwarz|date=2012-11-11|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The card ranking is as for [[Watten (card game)|Watten]], i.e. Sow ("A") - King - Ober - Unter - 10 - 9 - 8 - 7 - ''Weli''.&lt;ref name=Auer50/&gt;

In Austrian [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[William Tell pattern cards]] (also called "double German cards" or ''doppeldeutsche Karten'') are usually used for Bieten, while in [[South Tyrol]] the Salzburg pattern is more common.&lt;ref name=Pagat&gt;[https://www.pagat.com/last/bieten.html ''Bieten''] at www.pagat.com. Retrieved 31 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==
The dealer [[shuffles]] the cards and gives the player to his right, the opportunity to [[cut (cards)|cut]]. He then deals clockwise to each player - depending on the game variant - three or four cards (in two packets). [[Forehand (cards)|Forehand]] begins by playing a card, the other players follow in clockwise order. Players must follow suit (''[[Farbzwang]]''), but do not have to take the trick (no ''[[Stichzwang]]'').&lt;ref name=Auer50/&gt; There are no trumps. 

The winner of the [[trick (cards)|trick]] is the player who played the highest card of the led [[suit (cards)|suit]]. The winner leads to the next trick and so on until all the cards have been played. The cards remain face up on the table in front of each player.

== Figures ==
During the hands, each player has the right, if it is his turn (whether he is leading or not), to bid a 'figure' (''Figur'') before or after he plays the card to the trick.&lt;ref name = Auer54/&gt; A precondition is that he holds the figure in question (exception "Spiel" – see below) and that the figure has not yet been bid for in this hand.&lt;ref name = Auer54&gt;Auer (2015), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The following 5 figures may be bid for:&lt;ref name="Auer52/53"&gt;Auer (2015), pp. 52/53&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Red'' – won by the player with the highest Hearts card
* ''Green'' – won by the player with the highest Leaves card
* ''Gleich'' – won by the player with the highest ranking set of at least 2 cards. The highest ranking triple wins or, if no-one has a triple, the highest ranking pair
* ''Hanger'' or ''Hengst'' - won by the player with the highest run of 2 or more cards of the same suit e.g. Sow-King or Unter-10-9. The highest ranking 3-card run wins or, if no-one has a 3-card run, the highest ranking 2-card sequence.
* ''Spiel'' – winning the last trick of the hand

Bidding is initiated e.g. with the words, ''"I bid my Hearts"'' (''"I biet mein Herz"'') or ''"My Greens"'' (''"meine Grünen"'').&lt;ref name = Auer54/&gt; The remaining players must respond in clockwise order and have the following options:&lt;ref name=Auer54-56&gt;Auer (2015), pp. 54-56&lt;/ref&gt; 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Option (English)
! Option (German)
! Effect
|- 
| "Good" or "That's good"
|''"Guad"'', ''"Is guad"'', ''"Das Laub ist gut"'', ''"ist mir gut"'', ''"ich habe kein Laub"''
| Means "I'll fold." Said if player doesn't hold figure or thinks figure is too low to win. Concedes point(s) to bidder.
|- 
| "Hold", "I'll hold", "I'll see you", "I'll see your Hearts"
|''"Schaugn"'', ''"Ang'schaut"'', ''"I schau Dein Herz"'', ''"ich halte"'', ''"ich schaue Sie an"'', ''"ich gehe nicht."''
| Means "I'll see you" or "I'll call". Said if they think their figure is higher and they want to match the bid. Confirms the raised bid.
|- 
| "Three", "Three on that", "Three on your Hearts"  
|''"Drei!"'', ''"Drei drauf"'' or ''"3 auf Dei Herz"''
| Equivalent to "I'll raise to three". Said if player thinks their figure is higher, or to [[bluffing|bluff]], whereupon the other players must reply "good" or "hold"
|}

''Spiel'' is a slightly different figure. Each player may, at any time, bid on a ''Spiel'', because no-one knows at the start who will win the last trick. However, once the first card of the last trick is played, players may only bid if they have the same suit.

== Scoring ==
The aim of ''Laubbieten'' is to achieve a pre-agreed total number of game points, typically 11, and not to exceed it. At the end of each hand, players count their own points in accordance with the following rules:

* If a bid is declared "good" by all other players, the bidder gets 1 point, regardless of who has the highest figure
* If a bid is held (seen or called) by any player, the player with the highest figure gets 2 points
* If "three" is bid and declared "good" by all other players, the bidder gets 2 points, regardless of who has the highest figure
* If "three" is bid and held by any player, the player with the highest figure gets 3 points
* If a figure is not bid during a hand, the player with the highest figure automatically gets 1 point
* The player who has the ''[[Weli]]'' gets 1 point (except in Bavaria)&lt;ref name=Auer50&gt;Auer (2015), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

If two equally ranked figures occur (e.&amp;nbsp;g. twice 2x10s as a ''Gleich''), and the figure was held, then Leaves rank higher than Hearts and Hearts rank higher than the other suits. Another variant is that no player gets a point.

The winner is the player who, after several rounds, is the first to reach the agreed points target, say 11 points, and a small cross is marked in his column on the score sheet. The player with the lowest score is the loser and gets a black spot called a ''Noggele'' or ''Bummerl''. If a player gets close to the target, he may only bid enough so as not to exceed it (i.e. he may not overbid). In the Bavarian Inn Valley, for example, if 11 points is the target, at 10 points one is ''gespannt'' ("constrained") and may no longer bid (albeit bids are held). The penalty is a 2 point deduction or the award of 0 points.&lt;ref name=Pagat/&gt;

To work out the result of the game, the figures in the last deal are counted in a set order. First, figures that have been bid are scored in the order in which they were first bid; second, the remaining figures are scored in the order: Red, Green, Gleich, Hanger, Spiel.&lt;ref name=Pagat/&gt;

The usual penalty for breaches of the rules is a 2-point fine.&lt;ref name=Pagat/&gt;

It should be noted that the rules - especially concerning the ''Weli'' - vary from place to place and pub to pub.

== Own language ==
Just as the game of [[Schafkopf]] has its own language, so Bieten has its own language which is not always fully intelligible to outsiders.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Call
! Meaning
|-
| "Di Grian"
| "I'll bid on Leaves/Green" (''Laub/Grün'')
|- 
| "Di roatn"
| "I'll bid on Red/Hearts" (''Rot/Herz'')
|-
| "schaugn"
| "I'll hold", "I'll see you"
|- 
| "guad"
| "good" ("I'll fold")
|-
| "Drei drauf" 
| "Three"
|}

== Variants ==
=== Welibieten ===
Welibieten is an old variant which may be seen as a simple stepping stone to the more complex game of [[Perlaggen]]. Here, the Weli does not score a point for the player holding it, but may instead be used as a [[wild card (cards)|wild card]] at the point when it is played. It may be used as any other card of the player's choice, but ranks immediately below the [[natural card]] it represents.&lt;ref&gt;Auer (2015), pp. 61/62&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spitzbieten ===
Another traditional variant was Spitzbieten which took Welibieten one stage further and was actually a simple version of Perlaggen with only three cards. In addition to the Weli, the Seven of Bells and Seven of Acorns were also used as wild cards, called ''Spitzen''. They ranked in the order: {{Bells (cards)}}6 ''Weli'', {{Bells (card suit)}}7, {{Acorns}}7. Although simpler than Perlaggen, it is described as a complete and entertaining game for 2 or more players.&lt;ref&gt;Auer (2015), pp. 62/63&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Blood Knights''''' is a [[hack and slash]] [[action role-playing game]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] (through [[PlayStation Network]]), and [[Xbox 360]] (through [[Xbox Live Arcade]]). The game was developed by German studio [[Deck13 Interactive]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Kalypso Media]], also from Germany. ''Blood Knights'' was released on 1 November 2013 for the [[Xbox 360]], 13 November 2013 for the PC, and 19 November 2013 for the [[PlayStation 3]].

The game features two playable characters: Jeremy, a vampire hunter, and Alysa, a vampire that Jeremy became ritually bound to, on a quest to retrieve an artifact that can cause cataclysms. The game features both single player and local [[cooperative gameplay]] (co-op) modes, but does not allow for online co-op. ''Blood Knights'' received generally negative reviews upon release, with a large number of critics faulting the game for showing a lack of creativity and having uninteresting gameplay.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Blood Knights screenshot 1.png|thumb|left|Jeremy and Alysa engage in combat in co-op mode]]
The game combines [[Platform game|platformer]], [[role-playing game|role-playing]], and combat elements. Players move about several levels, including a forest and a castle, using precision jumping and puzzle solving to move about the level. Players can discover equipable weapons and armor that improves effectiveness in combat by exploring levels for chests. Combat takes the form of set piece battles, in which a number of enemies appear and must be defeated before the player can continue to progress through the area. These enemies include human outlaws, demons, werewolves, and other vampires. The game also contains [[Boss (video gaming)|boss battles]], in which the player must defeat a significantly stronger enemy that is aided by normal enemies.&lt;ref name=Fix&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Henry|title=Blood Knights|url=http://gaming.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/2124/blood-knights.html|work=The Digital Fix|publisher=Poisonous Monkey Limited|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OXMUS&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Cameron|title=Blood Knights review|url=http://www.oxmonline.com/blood-knights-review|work=Official Xbox Magazine|publisher=[[Future US, Inc.]]|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players assume control of Jeremy, a sword-wielding, melee-focused character, and Alysa, who uses crossbows to deliver ranged attacks. The game can be played as a single player game, in which the player alternates between controlling Jeremy and Alysa, or as a local co-op game, in which two players play cooperatively, with one controlling each character. ''Blood Knights'' does not support online co-op. Like most [[hack and slash]] games, the control scheme is minimal. When controlling Jeremy, players can chain attacks using one button (the X button on the Xbox 360), and can use a number of special attacks that have a cooldown timer, including a heavy blow, a whirlwind attack, and a power that draws distant enemies to Jeremy. While controlling Alysa, the game functions as a [[Shoot 'em up|twin-stick shooter]], in which movement is controlled by one [[Analog stick|thumbstick]] or set of keys, and firing weapons is controlled by the other thumbstick or another set of keys. Alysa also has special attacks, including the ability to fire flaming arrows and a grenade attack. In single player gameplay, the player can switch between Jeremy and Alysa by pressing a button (the Y button on the Xbox 360). Players can transfer health, in the form of blood, between the two playable characters, healing one at the expense of the other.&lt;ref name=Fix /&gt;&lt;ref name=ZTGD&gt;{{cite web|last=Leachman|first=Drew|title=Blood Knights (XBLA) Review|url=http://www.ztgd.com/reviews/blood-knights/|work=ZTGD|publisher=ZTGD|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OXMUK&gt;{{cite web|last=Blyth|first=Jon|title=Blood Knights|url=http://www.totalxbox.com/68605/reviews/blood-knights-review/?site=uk|work=Official Xbox Magazine UK|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|last=Donnelly|first=Jamie|title=Blood Knights Review (PC)|url=http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/bloodknights/2263/review.html|work=Strategy Informer|publisher=StrategyInformer|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--DYK FACT IS IN "ref name=Fix" SOURCE--&gt;

==Plot==

''Blood Knights'' takes place in a fictional version of Earth in which humans and vampires are at war. The main character, Jeremy, is the captain of a holy order that fights vampires. At the beginning of the game, the order travels to a set of ruins to protect the Blood Seal, a powerful artifact, from being captured by the vampires. The order suffers heavy losses in the attempt, and in desperation the priest Bartholomew uses a ritual to bind Jeremy to the vampire Alysa. During the course of Jeremy's attempt to retrieve the seal, he is turned into a vampire, and the vampires seize the seal themselves. With the seal removed from its resting place, the moon begins to crack apart, causing unpredictable and violent tides. Because Jeremy has been turned into a vampire himself, Bartholomew and another member of the holy order, Castello, kick Jeremy and Alysa into an abyss inside the ruins, abandoning them for dead. Castello assumes Jeremy's place as the captain of the order.

Jeremy and Alysa escape the ruins and pursue the vampires that stole the Blood Seal. Castello and the holy order are also pursuing the vampires. Jeremy and Alysa reach Godskeep, a human stronghold. In order to pass through the town, the pair must first rescue the town's sheriff, who went into a nearby forest with the town guard in an attempt to kill the powerful vampire Blood Fox. Jeremy and Alysa defeat Blood Fox, and in the town, Jeremy encounters Bartholomew, who split from Castello after an argument. Bartholomew tasks Jermey with recovering the Relic of Light, a powerful weapon that can be used against the vampires, in order to prove that Jeremy is still loyal to the order.

After retrieving the weapon, Jeremy is informed that the Lords of Pikehold, a group of knights that defends the area, have defeated the vampire army carrying the blood seal. On his way to Pikehold Castle, Jeremy is then ambushed by Castello. The pair fight Castello, who falls off a cliff after being defeated. Inside Pikehold Castle, Jeremy discovers that the Lords of Pikehold have become thralls to a [[succubus]]. Jeremy and Alysa defeat the Lords of Pikehold and the succubus, who informs Jeremy that the Blood Seal has been taken by a vampire mage to the top of a mountain.

Bartholomew meets Jeremy and Alysa at the top of the mountain, and informs the pair that the vampires have already summoned a powerful demon that will slaughter mankind. Bartholomew has called upon the army of Rome, led by the powerful First Paladin of Rome, to defeat the demon. Jeremy, knowing that the First Paladin of Rome would kill him and Alysa on sight, sets off to defeat the demon before the army of Rome arrives. When Jeremy and Alysa confront the demon, it explains that it was summoned because the humans have become too numerous, and with increased numbers they have gone from fearing vampires to hunting them. Jeremy and Alysa kill the demon and Bartholomew recovers the Blood Seal. As he does this, the First Paladin of Rome arrives and demands the seal for himself. Bartholomew gives the seal to Jeremy instead, and battles the Paladin to delay the army of Rome.

Jeremy travels back to the ruins from the beginning of the game, only to find that the army of Rome has beaten him there. Jeremy and Alysa meet the First Paladin in the Blood Seal's resting chamber. The Paladin explains that he wishes to destroy the seal, causing a great deluge that will bring the people, who had stopped believing the Church's teachings, back under the Church's influence. Jeremy refuses to allow the Paladin to do this, and the Paladin attacks. After being injured, the Paladin pulls back and Castello appears and attacks. Jeremy and Alysa kill Castello, and the Paladin re-enters the fight. Jeremy and Alysa appear to severely wound the First Paladin, but he boasts that vampires cannot kill him, as he is under the protection of Rome. Bartholomew emerges from behind the Blood Seal's resting place and slits the First Paladin's throat from behind, killing him. Bartholomew claims that although the Blood Seal was destroyed in battle, the moon will heal itself. He reveals that while he has heard that it can be done, he does not personally know how to turn Jeremy back into a human, and unless he is human, the bond between him and Alysa cannot be undone. The game ends with Jeremy and Alysa agreeing to work together to find a way to reverse Jeremy's transformation into a vampire.

''Blood Knights'' went through a number of delays before being published.

''Blood Knights'' received mixed to poor reviews upon release. At [[Metacritic]], a video game [[review aggregator]], the Xbox 360 version of the game received an average score of 45 out of 100, based on 7 reviews.&lt;ref name=MC_360 /&gt;{{ref label|B|B}} The [[Official Xbox Magazine|UK ''Official Xbox Magazine'']] remarked that "''Blood Knights'' holds as much annoyance as satisfaction",&lt;ref name=OXMUK /&gt; while the US version of ''Official Xbox Magazine'' contended that "''Blood Knights'' is too easy to ever become actively irritating, but its deficit of danger makes it too darn ''dull'' to hold even a devoted horror nut’s attention for long".&lt;ref name=OXMUS /&gt;

Critics took issue with the game's lack of originality. Henry Kelly of ''The Digital Fix'' comments that "The character models are quite basic and unimaginative - Jeremy has typically harsh features and the female characters are given skimpy outfits to show off their stereotyped fantasy physiques".&lt;ref name=Fix /&gt; ''X-ONE Magazine'' calls the game an "unashamed clone of ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]''", which borrows mechanics, naming conventions, and character archetypes from ''Diablo''.&lt;ref name=X-ONE /&gt; The gameplay was considered by critics to be too easy, with a terrible enemy AI that made combat unchallenging,&lt;ref name=OXMUS /&gt;&lt;ref name=SI /&gt;&lt;ref name=X-ONE /&gt; interspersed with what Henry Kelly called "painfully simple non-puzzles".&lt;ref name=Fix /&gt; Other components that faced criticism included the shallowness of the RPG elements,&lt;ref name=ZTGD /&gt;&lt;ref name=OXMUK /&gt;&lt;ref name=SI /&gt; the lack of online co-op,&lt;ref name=Fix /&gt;&lt;ref name=OXMUS /&gt; and the dialogue, which was considered poorly written and occasionally poorly acted.&lt;ref name=ZTGD /&gt;&lt;ref name=SI /&gt;

Reviewers did, however, have positive things to say about the game's co-op system, lack of online support notwithstanding. Cameron Lewis of ''Official Xbox Magazine'' US, in the summary of his review, noted that "complementary characters make local co-op effective".&lt;ref name=OXMUS /&gt; The UK version of the magazine called the co-op "pleasant",&lt;ref name=OXMUK /&gt; while ''X-ONE Magazine'' felt that the mode gave the game more substance.&lt;ref name=X-ONE /&gt;

'''''Britney and Kevin: Chaotic''''' is an American [[reality television]] series created and directed by [[Anthony E. Zuiker]]. Starring American recording artist [[Britney Spears]] and her then-husband [[Kevin Federline]], the five-episode series aired on [[UPN]] from May 17 to June 14, 2005. The series chronicles the couple's relationship from their courtship, engagement and wedding.

A majority of the footage was originally shot for Spears' own reality series to document the European leg of [[The Onyx Hotel Tour]] in the spring of 2004. Spears fell and injured her left knee during the shooting of the music video for "[[Outrageous (song)|Outrageous]]", causing the remainder of the tour and the series to be cancelled.

''Britney and Kevin: Chaotic'' was heavily criticized by critics, who considered  the series to be career suicide for Spears. Critics noted Spears' excessive [[narcissism]] and criticized the themes of the series as being too explicit. The DVD release of ''Britney and Kevin: Chaotic'' included Spears' first [[extended play]] of [[Britney &amp; Kevin: Chaotic (EP)|the same name]].

== Background ==
[[MTV News]] announced in April 2004 that Spears was planning a [[reality television]] series to document her backstage life during the European leg of [[The Onyx Hotel Tour]].&lt;ref name="ontour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486344/britney-takes-another-cue-from-madonna.jhtml|title=Britney Spears Takes Another Cue From Madonna, Shops Reality Series|date=April 13, 2004|accessdate=December 25, 2009|last=Moss|first=Corey |publisher=MTV. MTV Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitched as ''OnTourage'', footage from the six-week leg was to be compiled into a six-episode series, with each episode selling for about $1 million, "much more than most reality programs".&lt;ref name="ontour"/&gt; Spears was to narrate and shoot footage of her with her dancers and handlers.&lt;ref name="ontour"/&gt; The show was planned to be completed "as early as summer".&lt;ref name="ontour"/&gt;

On June 8, Spears was shooting the music video for "[[Outrageous (song)|Outrageous]]" in [[Queens]], when she fell and injured her left knee.&lt;ref name=outrageous&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,652994,00.html|title=Britney Cancels Tour Due to Bad Knee|date=June 16, 2004|accessdate=December 27, 2009|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|work=People|publisher=Time Warner}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was taken immediately to a local hospital and underwent [[Arthroscopy|arthroscopic surgery]] the next day. She was forced to remain six weeks with a knee brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused any future concerts to be canceled.&lt;ref name=outrageous/&gt; As a result, ''OnTourage'' was also scrapped.&lt;ref name="Britney's new show"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7844430/|title=Britney's new show explores ‘truth’|date=May 7, 2005|accessdate=December 30, 2009|last=Reporter|first=Access Hollywood|publisher=msnbc.com. NBC Universal / Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, Spears announced her engagement to American dancer [[Kevin Federline]], whom she had met three months before. As Federline had only recently ended his relationship with actress [[Shar Jackson]], who was pregnant with their second child, this engagement was the subject of extensive media coverage.&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html|title=Britney Spears' Biography&amp;nbsp;|publisher=Fox News|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=June 6, 2010|last=Reporter|first=Staff|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131124739/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html#|archive-date=January 31, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2007|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2004, the singer announced she would be taking another career break to start a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1492692/20041016/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney Spears Announces She's Taking a Break from Her Career|date=October 16, 2004|accessdate=June 10, 2010|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
After a "fierce bidding war", on April 5, 2005, it was announced that Spears had signed a deal with [[UPN]] to air a reality television series documenting her relationship with Federline. The series, which would air in five episodes, was revealed to chronicle the relationship "from the earliest stages of their courtship to their engagement and ultimately, their stroll down the aisle".&lt;ref name="mtv1"/&gt; In a statement about the series, Spears stated: "From the day that Kevin and I met, there have been constant rumors and inaccurate speculation about our lives together. I feel that last year, the tabloids ran my life, and I am really excited about showing my fans what really happened, rather than all the stories, which have been misconstrued by journalists in the past. As I mentioned before, I am now going to be expressing my personal life through art".&lt;ref name=mtv1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1499573/britney-kevin-new-newlyweds.jhtml|title=Britney Spears' Reality Show Is 'A Documentation Of Love'|date=April 5, 2005|last=Harris|first=Chris|accessdate=September 11, 2011|publisher=[[MTV]]. [[MTV Networks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was initially titled ''Britney and Kevin: Can You Handle Our Truth?'', before its title was changed to ''Britney and Kevin: Chaotic'', with "Can you handle our truth?" becoming its tagline.&lt;ref name=flak&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flakmag.com/tv/britneytv.html|title=Britney &amp; Kevin: Chaotic|last=Carik|first=Taylor|date=May 26, 2005|accessdate=September 11, 2011|work=[[Flak Magazine]]|publisher=[[J.

It's really weird because it was like all this tension at first. We were so nervous being together. I'm really shy, and when I had the camera in my hand, it made me feel more outspoken."&lt;ref name=mtv2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1501849/20050513/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Reality-TV Britney Asks Fans: Can You Handle The Truth?|author=Jennifer Vineyard|date=May 13, 2005|accessdate=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical response ==
''Britney and Kevin: Chaotic'' was heavily criticized by critics. Taylor Carik of ''[[Flak Magazine]]'' considered the series an "insult to common sense and decency",&lt;ref name=flak/&gt; while commenting that "Britney's ridiculous behavior in ''Chaotic'' confirms the obvious transparency of her status as a 'celebrity product' and the calculated nature of her success".&lt;ref name=flak/&gt; He also noted that [[music critics]] would "easily open the floodgates for new and creative ways to discuss her offense to pop culture's attempts at meaningfulness".&lt;ref name=flak/&gt; Aaron Beierle of [[DVD Talk]] reviewed the series as an "absolute disaster of the highest order", while writing that: "[''Britney &amp; Kevin: Chaotic''] is an absolutely watchable and horrifying train wreck of a series".&lt;ref name=dvdtalk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/18078/britney-and-kevin-chaotic-cd-dvd/|title=Britney and Kevin: Chaotic (CD+DVD)|last=Beierle|first=Aaron|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]. [[Internet Brands]]|date=October 7, 2005|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slant Magazine]] writer Ed Gonzalez noted that "the show's extreme shooting style makes it especially hard to stare at what is—no more no less—a totem to the pop singer's narcissism". He stated that the views Spears expresses in the series suggest that she is "someone who believes they're the only person on the face of the earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/britney-and-kevin-chaotic|title=Britney and Kevin: Chaotic|date=May 18, 2005|accessdate=September 11, 2011|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|last=Gonzalez|first=Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Josh Wolk of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt that ''Britney and Kevin: Chaotic'' was Spears' "career suicide by videocam", commenting, "the truth is not only that she's vapid, but that she's self-obsessed to a dangerous degree". Wolk also noted "many intersecting things wrong on this show and with Britney that I can't possibly prioritize them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1062735,00.html|title=Shooting Her Own Foot|last=Wolk|first=Josh|date=May 18, 2005|accessdate=September 11, 2011|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Warner]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Fries of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' perceived the series as "a visual assault of nauseating camera angles, likely to upset even the most desensitized TV viewer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117927180|title=Britney and Kevin: Chaotic|date=May 18, 2005|accessdate=September 11, 2011|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayley Butler of [[Jam!]] gave the final episode of the series a mixed review, saying it "was full of tear-jerking moments" and "the only episode not full of stupid jokes, childish behaviour and Britney's thoughts on life", commenting that Spears and Federline wedding scenes "looked to be a very emotional and touching event". Butler also wondered "if they feel their show served its purpose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/B/Britney_And_Kevin_Chaotic/2005/06/16/1091361-ca.html|title=Britney's 'Chaotic' series wraps up|last=Butler|first=Hayley|publisher=[[Jam!]]|date=June 14, 2005|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Broadcasting Authority of Ireland''' ('''BAI''') ({{lang-ga|Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann}}) was established on 1 October 2009 effectively replacing the  '''Broadcasting Commission of Ireland''' ('''BCI''') ({{lang-ga|Coimisiún Craolacháin na hÉireann}}).

The BAI is the regulator of both public and commercial broadcasting sector in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

==History==
*The Authority came into being under the [[Broadcasting Act 2009]]. Prior to its establishment on 30 September 2009, as a Commission, it was set up as the '''Independent Radio and Television Commission''' ('''IRTC''') under the terms of the Radio and Television Act, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1988/en/act/pub/0020/index.html|title=Radio and Television Act, 1988|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act allowed the first legal stations not operated by RTÉ to come into existence. Prior to this commercial broadcasting in Ireland had been unlicensed and illegal. Despite this a thriving pirate radio scene existed. The Act sought to bring this under a regulatory framework.
*From 1989 onwards the Commission began to license Independent Local Radio stations. It also sought to introduce a national radio and television service. But while ILR was mostly successful, both national efforts ran into difficulty.
*In the case of the radio service, [[Century Radio]], it went bankrupt within months, issues surrounding the then Minister for Justice and Communications [[Ray Burke (Irish politician)|Ray Burke]] were also raised as he sought to deregulate the system. In 1997 Radio Ireland won the contract for Ireland's commercial national Radio service, now [[Today FM]]. Meanwhile, the selected contractor for the television service [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]], took eight years to find a backer before it finally went on air.
*The Broadcasting Act, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0004/index.html|title=Broadcasting Act, 2001|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the Commission its most recent past name and increased its powers. It can now issue contracts for broadcasting via cable, satellite, and most recently DTT under a different model from 2001 [[Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007]], and can also develop codes in relation to various broadcasting activities. The first, a code on children's advertising, has proved highly controversial. Under the Broadcasting Act 2009&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2008/2908/b2908s.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Commission has been abolished and its powers transferred to the new Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's Contract Awards Committee. The BAI incorporates the role of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission for Ireland and also the regulatory powers of the [[RTÉ Board|RTÉ Authority]] and [[TG4|Teilifís na Gaeilge]], these now having simply corporate governance and strategic roles, losing their self-regulatory roles. While the contract award process will not be radically altered, the Authority will now have powers to fine stations rather than having to remove their contracts.
*The Commission also operated the Broadcasting Funding Scheme or Sound &amp; Vision which distributes 5% of the collected TV licence to projects on film, TV and radio and under the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, this will continue, including increased requirements for spend on indigenous programming. This is further to the Broadcasting (Funding) Act 2003. So far over €30&amp;nbsp;Million euro has been invested into the audio visual sector in Ireland as a result of the scheme, enabling 280 projects to be funded and broadcast in peak listener/viewer times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bci.ie/broadcast_funding_scheme/index.html|title=BCI Tech News|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906233836/http://www.bci.ie/broadcast_funding_scheme/index.html|archivedate=6 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Previous Role of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI)===
The BCI was responsible for arranging the provision of television and radio services in addition to those provided by [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] (RTÉ). In addition, it was responsible for developing codes on advertising and other matters, which apply both its own stations and those of RTÉ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bci.ie|title=BCI Tech News|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its role has expanded following the statutory instrument signed by Minister Eamonn Ryan on 24 September 2009 to include Analogue terrestrial television switchoff in Ireland (aerial/transmitter system) and licensing the more channel spacious digital terrestrial television channel licensing that it will undertake once the commercial DTT contract is concluded with the current consortium.&lt;ref name="dcenr.gov.ie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press+Releases/Minister+Ryan+establishes+Broadcasting+Authority+of+Ireland.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018104201/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press%2BReleases/Minister%2BRyan%2Bestablishes%2BBroadcasting%2BAuthority%2Bof%2BIreland.htm |archivedate=18 October 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bai.ie/|title=Home - Broadcast Authority of Ireland|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contract method under the BCI====
*The BCI awarded television and radio programme contracts (typically called "licences", though the actual broadcasting licences are really issued by [[Commission for Communications Regulation|ComReg]]) by a "beauty contest" system.
*Typically the Authority will decide on the area and type of service to be provided. It then asks for expressions of interest, which will then lead to an actual contest for the contract. Each bidder for the contract submits a detailed business plan and programming proposals to the Authority, which then selects a preferred bidder.
*It will then conduct further negotiations before issuing the contract. However, the previous Commission had limited ability to enforce contracts once issued. It could issue stations warnings or ultimately threaten them with the loss of contract, but this is regarded as a "nuclear option" and is often very unpopular with the stations' listenership. More often, it would try to negotiate with the station in order to influence its programming. Only in one instance - [[Radio Limerick One]] - was a station's contract terminated midway through its run. In three further cases - [[North West Radio]], [[Radio Kilkenny]], and [[Carlow Kildare Radio]] - the stations contract was awarded to a different company at the end of its term. These decisions proved very politically unpopular and have led to calls for the BCI to automatically renew contracts unless there have been stated misbehaviour. However, as Independent Local Radio stations typically have a monopoly, this would mean no new enterants could ever enter the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bci.ie/news_information/news_archive.html|title=BCI Tech News|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210140316/http://www.bci.ie/news_information/news_archive.html|archivedate=10 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|title=Minister Ryan discusses the Broadcasting Act (|publisher=Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources/Youtube.com|date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI)

*1. took over the functions of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission,
*2. as well as certain powers of the RTÉ Authority and the board of Téilifis na Gaeilge (TG4) on 1 October 2009.
*3. It will have new powers to fine broadcasters where it deems appropriate contract breaches require such but do not necessitate premature contract end

The Authority officially came into being when a [[Statutory Instrument]] appointed 1 October 2009 as the day for it to assume its powers was made by the Minister for Communications, Energy, and Natural Resources. Until then, the BCI continued to operate under the terms of the Radio and Television Act 1988, notwithstanding the 2009 Act's repeal of that Act.

=== Members ===
The Authority comprises nine members. Five members were announced on 30 September 2009 and were appointed by the Government of Ireland on the nomination of the Minister and a further four were appointed following the nomination of the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

The five government appointees to the Authority are:
*Dr Pauric Travers, the current Chairperson; currently a graduate of University College Dublin and the Australian National University, Canberra. An eminent historian and educationalist, he is President Emeritus of St Patrick’s College, Drumcondra, having completed 13 years as President/CEO 
*Alan McDonnell (Managing director of Empeira Consultants)
*Grace Smith (Legal professional with over 20 years practice as an
international lawyer in a large legal practice)
*Professor Maeve McDonagh (Academic Lawyer specialising in information law including freedom of information, data protection and information technology law and human rights law)
*Seamus Martin (Retired international editor of The Irish Times)

In addition to the Authority, the BAI comprises two separate and independent committees – a Contract Awards Committee and a Compliance Committee.

'''The Contract Awards Committee''' members include:

*Ercus Stewart S.C. (Chairperson); Barrister
*Mr John Hogan; Business consultant
*Eimer McGovern;  Chief Financial Officer with Fenergo
*Ms Clodagh O’Donnell; Management consultant

'''The Compliance Committee''' members are:

*Professor Kevin Rafter (Chairperson); Professor of Political Communication at Dublin City University;
*Ms Paula Mullooly; Solicitor
*Mr Nigel Heneghan; Managing director of Heneghan PR
*Ms Eileen Maher; Communications consultant

The Contracts Award Committee licenses independent commercial and community broadcasters including digital television providers.

The Compliance Committee requires all broadcasters, public or private, to comply with their licence conditions, broadcasting codes and rules. New codes in relation to children's advertising, among others, were introduced under the Broadcasting Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/digital/digitaltv/?act1=record&amp;only=1&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4282739&amp;tpl=archnews&amp;force=1|title=New BAI Committees Announced - The Irish Film &amp; Television Network|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Sound and Vision Fund==

The BAI is in charge of the Irish government's Broadcasting Fund which is taken from the TV Licence Fee. Since 2006 the BCI have given nearly €20million euro to Independent producers for TV, Radio and Film that meet the requirement of the scheme. They have provided funds to programmes and films such as ''[[Hunger]]'' ([[Film Four]]), ''[[Aifric]]'' and ''[[Kings (2007 film)|Kings]]'' ([[TG4]]), ''School Run'' ([[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]]) and ''[[Garage (film)|Garage]]'' ([[RTÉ]]). The producer must have the support of a Free-to-air broadcaster, the UK's broadcasters are sufficient since they are available FTA via Satellite, Setanta have produced a discussion ''Sports Matter'' which is unencrypted when it airs on the channel.

The '''charango''' is a small [[Andes|Andean]] [[stringed instrument]] of the [[lute]] family, which probably originated in the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] and [[Aymara people|Aymara]] populations in post-Colombian times, after European stringed instruments were introduced by the Spanish during colonialization. The instrument is widespread throughout the Andean regions of [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], northern [[Chile]] and northwestern [[Argentina]], where it is a popular musical instrument which exists in many variant forms.&lt;ref name="charango"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charango.cl/paginas/encuentros.htm|title=ORIGEN DEL CHARANGO|publisher=charango.cl|accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 66&amp;nbsp;cm [26 inches] long, the charango was traditionally made with the shell from the back of an [[armadillo]] (''quirquincho'', ''mulita''),&lt;ref name="1uu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2uu" /&gt; but also it can be made of wood, which some believe to be a better resonator.  Wood is more commonly used in modern instruments.&lt;ref name="1uu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charango.cl/paginas/cualidad.htm|title=Todo acerca del Charango|publisher=charango.cl|accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charangos for children may also be made from [[Lagenaria siceraria|calabash]].&lt;ref name="2uu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jlfeijooi.en.eresmas.com/Familia_de_los_charangos.htm|title=Familia de los charangos|publisher=jlfeijooi.en.eresmas.com|accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary charangos are now made with different types of wood. It typically has 10 strings in five [[course (music)|courses]] of 2 strings each, but many other variations exist.

The charango was primarily played in traditional Andean music, but is more and more frequently being used by other Latin American musicians. A charango player is called a ''charanguista''.

==History==
[[Image:Cuna del charango.jpg|thumb|A sign in [[Potosi, Bolivia]], in the style of a charango with the words 'Cuna del Charango' (Birthplace of the Charango).]]
[[Image:210 Museu de la Música, el Bosc, charango.jpg|A traditional charango made of ''armadillo'', today superseded by wooden charangos, in [[Museu de la Música de Barcelona]]|thumb]]

When the Spanish ''[[conquistadores]]'' came to South America, they brought the [[vihuela]] (an ancestor of the classical guitar) with them. It is not clear whether the charango is a direct descendent of a particular Spanish stringed instrument; it may have evolved from the vihuela, [[bandurria]] ([[mandolin]]), or the [[lute]]. [[Ernesto Cavour]], charanguista, composer, and consulting music historian for many museums around the world,&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Ernesto Cavour]]&lt;/ref&gt; has noted characteristics of the charango in various vihuelas and guitars of the 16th century, and maintains the charango is the direct descendent of the vihuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html |last=Cavour |first=Ernesto A. |title=Historia del charango |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523023030/http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html |archive-date=23 May 2015 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many stories of how the charango came to be made with its distinctive diminutive soundbox of armadillo. One story says that the native musicians liked the sound the vihuela made, but lacked the technology to shape the wood in that manner. Another story says that the Spaniards prohibited natives from practicing their ancestral music, and that the charango was a successful attempt to make a lute that could be easily hidden under a garment such as a [[poncho]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Creating Our Own: Folklore, Performance, and Identity in Cuzco, Peru|author=Mendoza, Z.S.|date=2008|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822341529|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmfazJL5jFIC|page=97|accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no clear evidence that points to a specific location or moment in time for the birth of the charango but there are a number if theories being debated. One of those is that it is believed the charango came into its present form in the early part of the 18th century in the city of Potosi in the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]] part of the Viceroyalty of Peru (in what is present-day [[Bolivia]]), probably from [[Amerindian]] contact with [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish settlers]].  Cavour presents evidence from Bolivian murals and sculptures as far back as 1744—in, for example, the Church of San Lorenzo of the city of Potos ([[Potosí]]), the facade of which depicts two mermaids playing what he believes to be charangos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html  ''Op cit''., Cavour, Ernesto ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523023030/http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html |date=May 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another two theories that are being researched are that the Charango originally came to what is now known as modern day Potosi Bolivia, from the Ayacucho region in Colonial Peru as a result of migrations from the quechua populations. This would posit that the charango originated in what is a territory within modern day Peru from the process of cultural miscegenation and then spread to the rest of the Andean area. This theory has not been proven either.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornada.com.pe/cultural/6683-ayacucho-cuna-del-charango]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because in those times neither Peru nor Bolivia were established as Republics, pinning the Charango's origin to a modern day country is therefore problematic and a highly debated issue among nationalists from both countries.

One Bolivian musician has posited a third theory which is that the Charango was created as a variant of the timple canario from the Canary islands. More research however is required.

The first published historic information on the charango may be that gathered by Vega, going back to 1814, when a cleric from Tupiza documented that "the Indians used with much enthusiasm the guitarrillos mui fuis... around here in the Andes of Bolivia they called them Charangos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3hvsAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=charango+guitarrillos+mui+fuis&amp;dq=charango+guitarrillos+mui+fuis|title=Historia musical de Bolivia|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2015|author1=Gainza|first1=José Díaz|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Turino mentions that he found carved sirens representing playing charangos in some Colonial churches in the highlands of Bolivia.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=World Music: Latin &amp; North America, Caribbean, India, Asia and Pacific|author1=Broughton, S.|author2=Ellingham, M.|author3=Trillo, R.|date=1999|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=9781858286365|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QzX8THIgRjUC|page=278|accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the churches to which Turino refers may well be that mentioned by Cavour; construction on the San Lorenzo edifice began in 1547 and wasn't completed until 1744.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html  ''Op cit'', Cavour, Ernesto] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523023030/http://www.puebloindio.org/Historia_del_charango.html |date=May 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Eduardo Carrasco]] of [[Quilapayún]], in the first week after the [[1973 Chilean coup d'etat]], the military organized a meeting with folk musicians where it was explained that the traditional instruments charango and [[quena]] were now banned.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;Morris, Nancy. 1986. Canto Porque es Necesario Cantar: The New Song Movement in Chile, 1973–1983. ''[[Latin American Research Review]]'', Vol. 21, pp. 117-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The origin of the term "charango" is not entirely clear.  One source suggests that the instrument took its name from its players, who were called ''charangeros'', meaning "someone of questionable character and low morals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Candaleria |first=Cordelia |title=Encyclopedia of Latino Popular Culture, Volume I |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |location=Westport |year=2004 |page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another traces the term to the alteration of a Spanish term, ''charanga'', which could refer to either a type of military music played on wind instruments, or an out-of-tune orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Machpherson |editor-first=A. |title=Webster's Etymological Dictionary |publisher=Ulan Press |location=Rochester |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charanguista Alfredo Coca, offers yet a third theory:  asserting that "charango" comes from a Spanish corruption of the Quechua word “Chajwaku”, which means joy, noisy, boisterous, referring directly to the sound of the charango.  As support for this he points to the common practice of the Conquistadors appropriating local terminology.

Charanguista [[Ernesto Cavour]] disagrees, and tends to support the second origin, maintaining that the word “charango” comes from a mispronunciation of the Spanish word “charanga”, meaning "brass band" (a reasonable corollary to 'military music played on wind instruments').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cocha-banner.org/issues/2012/may/long/ Long Live the Charango!]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most complete contemporary statements on the origin of the term "charango" appears in the introduction to Duran and Pedrotti's, ''Charango Method'', ostensibly the first complete, bilingual charango method to be published:

:"Charango" in an Ibero-American colonial term that refers to a series of Spanish-American cultural concepts related to "noise" and rustically constructed objects.  The term "charanga", for example, was often used to refer to a small instrumental band.  "Charanguero", meanwhile, denoted something rough or rustic.  In his book ''El charango, su vida, costumbres y desaventuras'', Ernesto Cavour has collected a large amount of information regarding the etymology of the word "charango".  As this author related:
:::"In the rural areas of Andean Bolivia, the instruemnt is not only known by the name "charango", but by many others as well, including:  mediana, guitarrilla, thalachi, quirqui, p'alta, khonkhota, aiquileno, guitarron, anzaldeno, etc. ..."
:An Uruguan publication from 1823 uses the term "changango" as a synonym for the Argentine "charango", and claims the same word was used during the eighteenth century to refer to old and poorly constructed guitars:
:::"...In Argentina they speak of the Charango, a guitar with five doubled strings and a body made from the shell of an Armadillo.  Nevertheless, the small Spanish-American guitar has been known by the name changango for more than one hundred years.  In a footnote to his correspondence with [[Paulino Lucero]] regarding the [[Great War]], Hilario Ascasubi explains this situation with indisputable clarity:  "Changango: an old, poorly made guitar".
:::(Excerpt from the newspaper "El Domador", Montecivideo, 19 March 1823).
:Julio Mendivil engages in a similarly detailed discussion of this issue in his article ''La construccion de la historia:  el charango en la memoria colectiva mestiza ayacuchana'', Musicology Institut/University of Colonia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duran |first=Horatio |last2=Pedrotti |first2=Italo |title=Charango Method |publisher=Mel Bay Publications |location=Pacific, MO |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2017}}

==Construction==
[[Image:Parts of the Charango 1.jpg|thumbnail|283px|Designation of the parts of the charango]]
Traditionally a charango was made with a dried [[armadillo]] shell for the back and wood for the soundbox top, neck etc. While still common, this is no longer the norm: rather they are now typically made of wood, with the bowled back merely imitating the shape of the armadillo shell. Unlike most wooden lutes, the body and neck are typically made of a single block of wood, carved into shape. The charango's ten strings require quite a large headstock, often approaching or even exceeding the size of its diminutive sound box. Aside from these visual distinctions, it resembles something between a bowl-backed mandolin and a small [[ukulele]].

The overall length of a typical charango is about 66&amp;nbsp;cm, with a string scale length of about 37&amp;nbsp;cm. The number of frets ranges from five to eighteen. The most common form of the instrument has ten strings of nylon, gut, or (less commonly) metal.  (Variant forms of the charango may have anywhere from four to fifteen strings, in various combinations of single, double, or triple [[course (music)|courses]].)  The body generally has a narrowed ''waist'', reminiscent of the guitar family, and not the pear-shape of the lute.  There are many minor variations in the shape of the body and soundboard (top), and many different kinds of wood are used, although, like guitars, the preferred [[tone wood]]s for the top come from the cedar or spruce families. Old instruments had friction-style tuning pegs (similar to those used on violins), but today a classical guitar style peghead with geared "machine" tuners is the norm, though these are occasionally positioned perpendicular to the headstock.  Most instruments include some degree of ornamentation, which may range from simple purfling inlays around the perimeter of the top, to elaborately carved headstocks, and whole scenes engraved, carved, or burned into the back of the body.  Strap buttons are sometimes added, as are position marker dots on the fingerboard.

Variations may include a separate glued-on neck, a two-piece top plate of contrasting woods, old-style friction tuning pegs in [[palisander]] or [[ebony]], guitar-style box construction, or even a hollowed-out neck.  The size, shape, and number of soundholes is highly variable and may be a single round or oval hole, dual crescents, or even multiple holes of varying arrangement.  Another variant is a neck with two holes bored 3/4 of the way through, parallel to the fretboard and close to the headstock (an innovation said to color the instrument's tone).{{Dubious|date=March 2015}}{{Citation needed|reason=Source of the information concerning these holes? Have seen and played dozens of charangos, but never any with holes bored in the neck.|date=March 2015}}

More recently solid-body electric and hollow-body acoustic-electric charangos have become available. The solid-body instruments are built very much as miniature electric guitars, whereas the acoustic-electrics are usually a standard acoustic charango with the addition of a [[contact microphone]] or [[piezoelectric]] [[pickup (music technology)|pickup]] to run the output of the instrument through an amplifier.

In his book ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'', Che Guevara describes an instrument that he identified as a charango while near [[Temuco]], Chile, in 1952. It was "made with three or four wires some two meters in length stretched tightly across tins fixed to a board. The musician uses a kind of metal knuckle duster with which he plucks the wires producing a sound like a toy guitar."&lt;ref&gt;The Motorcycle Diaries: Notes on a Latin American Journey. by Ernesto Che Guevara. Ocean Press. 2003. {{ISBN|1-876175-70-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuning==
The basic charango has five pairs (or courses) of strings, typically tuned GCEAE. This tuning, disregarding octaves, is similar to the typical C-tuning of the [[ukulele]] or the Venezuelan [[Cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]], with the addition of a second E-course. Unlike most other stringed instruments, all ten strings are tuned inside one octave. The five courses are pitched as follows (from 5th to 1st course): G4 G4 - C5 C5 - E5 E4 - A4 A4 -E5 E5. Some ''charanguistas'' use "octave" strings on other pairs in addition to the middle course. Note that the lowest pitch is the "E" string in the middle (3rd) course, preceded by the higher pitched "g" (5th) course and "c" (4th) course, and followed by still higher pitched "a" (2nd) course and "e" (1st) courses. This tuning pattern is known as a [[Reentrant tuning|re-entrant]] pattern because the pitches of the strings do not rise steadily from one string or course to the next, but progress from high to low and then back to high pitch again.

[[Image:Charango player.jpg|right|260px|thumb|A charango player.]]

The ramifications of the charango tuning are that there is a very narrow tonal range in most chords, often with many pitch duplications, which produces a surprisingly powerful sound from the small instrument. Seventh and ninth chords shimmer more than on a guitar due to the close harmonies. In terms of melody playing, the ''charanguista'' can create a harp-like sound with close intervals ringing out (i.e., like a piano with the sustain pedal engaged). With the close pitch spacing across strings (intervals like 2nds), a simple alternating finger-style pattern in the right hand can produce very rapid chromatic and diatonic runs with only minimal movement of the left hand on the fingerboard.  This makes the charango an extremely agile melodic instrument, especially when compared to instruments traditionally played with a [[Plectrum|flat pick]].

As with any stringed instrument, tunings for the charango may vary, but the "standardized" tunings most commonly used (for the 10-stringed, five-course version) are:

There are metal string, nylon/gut string, and mixed-string charangos. Some metal-stringed versions have all strings at the same gauge. There are also solid-body electric charangos.

There are many types of charango. In many cases the variant is named for the town or region in which it originated, or in which it is most frequently seen (e.g., the ''Charango Ayquileño'' of Ayquile, Bolivia). The number of strings on these variant instruments ranges from 4 to 20, and courses may be single, double, triple, or quadruple strung. (The standard charango has 10 strings in 5 courses of 2 strings each.)&lt;ref&gt;''Asociación Internacional del Charango'' (Spanish)|{{cite web|url=http://www.aicharango.org/portal/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202039/http://www.aicharango.org/portal/index.php |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of charango are:

* '''[[Walaycho]]''' (also ''hualaycho'', ''maulincho'', or '' kalampiador''):  a smaller relative, with a scale typically around 30&amp;nbsp;cm long.  It has 10 strings (which may be of metal, nylon, or nylon fishing line) arranged in 5 courses of two strings each. Despite the short scale the headstock must still accommodate ten tuners, which increases the total length of the instrument by nearly a third (ca. 56&amp;nbsp;cm is typical). Usually tuned a ''fifth higher'' (sometimes a fourth higher) than the charango, strings in the 3rd (center) course may be either in unison or in octaves.
* '''[[charangon|Charangón]]''':  (also ''charangone'') a larger relative, in effect, a tenor charango.  About 75&amp;nbsp;cm long by 22&amp;nbsp;cm wide with a 42–51&amp;nbsp;cm scale.  Tunings vary, with the most common being a ''fourth lower'' than the charango (Argentine tuning) or a ''fifth lower'' (Bolivian tuning).  It is occasionally tuned an octave lower that the charango, but such lower pitches are more usually reserved for the ronroco.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa, Jose; ''The history of music from Cuba, the Caribbean, South America and the United States''; Contemporary Latin Music Educators; Southwest Ranches, Florida:  2008.  p.68&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Ronroco]]''' (also ''ronrroco''): a still larger relative, essentially a baritone or bass charango, about 80&amp;nbsp;cm long with a 46–50&amp;nbsp;cm scale. It was invented by [[Los Kjarkas|Gonzalo Hermosa]],  of the group [[Los Kjarkas]] from Cochabamba, Bolivia, in the 1980s. Ten nylon strings are arranged in five double courses. As with the ''charangón'' tunings vary, and depending on region and use the ronroco may be tuned a ''fourth lower'' than the charango (Argentine tuning); a ''fifth lower'' (Bolivia; Chile); or an octave lower ("Bolivian tuning").  The octave lower tuning is better acoustically supported by the larger body of the ronroco, and is more common on this instrument than on the charangón.  The strings of the 3rd (center) course are tuned an octave apart; strings in the other courses are usually tuned in unisons, though occasionally the 4th or 5th courses (or both) may be tuned in octaves.  When courses 4 and 5 are doubled at the ''lower'' octave the ronroco is essentially no longer in reentrant tuning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guitar-learning.com/node/208 A Guitarist's Choice To Play The Ronroco (baritone charango)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Chillador]]''': The name chillador can refer either to two related types of charango. The first is a standardly-tuned charango but with a body built from bent sides and a flat back like a (smaller) guitar &lt;ref&gt;http://www.atlasofpluckedinstruments.com/south_america.htm#bolivia South America ATLAS of Plucked Instruments &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://stringedinstrumentdatabase.aornis.com/c.htm The Stringed Instrument Database: C&lt;/ref&gt;, The second is a type which has a flat back and is usually steel-strung. It exists in both 10-and 12-string forms.  When strung with 10-strings (in 5 courses) it is tuned the same as a charango.  With 12 strings, courses 2 and 4 are triple-strung, and the (re-entrant) tuning is more like that of a charangone or ronroco in Argentine tuning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charangoperu.com/charangoperu/contenido/articulos/chillador_antiplano2.php|title=Charangoperu.com :: El portal del Charango Peruano|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''[[Hatun charango|Hatun Charango]]''' or "grand charango" is an extended-range charango developed in [[Peru]] in the modern era. It has either seven or eight strings, all set in single string courses except for the third course, which is double-strung. It is tuned (A3) • D4 • G4 • C5 • E5 E4 • A4 • E5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federico-tarazona.com/thehatuncharango.html |title=Federico Tarazona - The Hatun charango |author=claire charberet |publisher= |accessdate=6 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402232808/http://www.federico-tarazona.com/thehatuncharango.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other, less common members of the charango family include:
* '''Ayacucho''':  A small guitar-style charango (flat back) usually made of plywood, with 6 strings in 5 courses, strung 1-1-2-1-1. Smaller than the charango, but not as small as the walyacho, it is tuned like the charango, with the strings of the doubled course in octaves.&lt;ref name="charangoperu.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charangoperu.com/charangoperu/contenido/articulos/charangoperuano.php|title=Charangoperu.com :: Mapa del Charango Peruano|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bajo charango''':  A large bass instrument, more guitar-like than charango-like, it was invented by luthier Mauro Nunez in the region of Cochabamba.  It is about 1.5m long, with a scale of 87&amp;nbsp;cm, and the large resonating body is usually made of plywood. Six strings in five courses (1-1-2-1-1-) are typically tuned:  B • E • B • G • D, with the 3rd (center) course in octaves. It sounds two octaves lower than the charango, and is written as a transposing instrument, with parts notated a 4th higher than they actually sound.&lt;ref name="Familia de los charangos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jlfeijooi.en.eresmas.com/Familia_de_los_charangos.htm|title=Familia de los charangos|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chango''' a larger member of the charango family, from 104 to 108&amp;nbsp;cm long with a scale of about 80–84&amp;nbsp;cm. It has 20 nylon strings set in ten courses, two strings to a course, and is tuned in fifths. Invented in Bolivia by the Shuarscovliente brothers, it has no frets; the strings are played open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finslab.com/enciclopedia/letra-c/charango.php|title=Charango|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Charango mediano''' or ''mediana'' ("medium" charango):  a rural instrument that varies widely in size:  from 50–95&amp;nbsp;cm, with scales ranging from 33–65&amp;nbsp;cm. It has 10 strings in 5 courses, and is usually tuned an octave below the charango.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Khonkhota''' (also ''jitarron'' or ''pomputu''):  A rustic instrument of the rural regions of Cochabamba, Oruro, and Potosí. Its soundbox is made of plywood, and it has only 5 frets. The total length is 90&amp;nbsp;cm, with a 65&amp;nbsp;cm scale. It has 8 strings in 5 courses (2-2-1-1-2); the doubled courses are all unison doublings. Tunings vary, with a common choice being E-A-D-B-C.&lt;ref name="Familia de los charangos"/&gt;
* '''Moquegua''':  Charango with 20 strings arranged in five courses of four strings each. Tuning is like the standard charango with the third (central) course using octave doublings.&lt;ref name="charangoperu.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evoOlVY-1nk&amp;nofeather=True|title=charango moquegua (charango de 20 cuerdas) - YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Pampeno''' (also ''Arequipeño''):  Another rustic, guitar-style, plywood charango used in the Arequipa region of Peru. It's 15 metal strings, triple strung in 5 courses, are tuned: C# - F# - C# - A - E, with the third (middle) course in octaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charangoperu.com/charangoperu/contenido/portal/Pagina%203.php|title=Charangoperu.com :: El portal del Charango Peruano|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgi6QaNxc6M&amp;nofeather=True|title=CHARANGO AREQUIPEÑO(PAMPEÑO) - YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Shrieker''':  An instrument from the South of the Peru similar to the walaycho, made of wood or armadillo. Typically less than 30&amp;nbsp;cm long, it differs from the walaycho in having 12 (usually metal) strings in five courses; the second and fourth courses are triple-strung. Tuning is the same as for the walyacho.&lt;ref&gt;Op Cit "Charango"&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sonko''':  A large heart-shaped instrument with 13 (and sometimes more) strings. It is a fairly recent development, first designed in the 1970s, by Gerardo Yañez.&lt;ref name="gerardoyanez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gerardoyanez.com/instrumentos/sonko-charango/|title=Sonko Charango - Gerardo Yañez Sarmiento|publisher=gerardoyanez.com|accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has not yet acquired a standard tuning.
* '''Vallegrandino''':  Named for the town of its origin, Vallegrande, Bolivia, this charango is about 50&amp;nbsp;cm long, with a scale of 33&amp;nbsp;cm, and has 6 strings in four courses:  1 - 2 -2 -1. Tuning is A-E-C-G.&lt;ref&gt;Op Cit. "Charango"&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the most popular stringed instruments in regions along the Andes, countless other regional variations of the charango exist, for example:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* ''charango Anzaldeño''
* ''charango Ayquileño''

}}

Several hybrids of charango with other instruments have also been made, for example:  ''charanquena'' (charango and [[quena]]); ''charansicu'' (charango and [[zampoña]]); and ''charango charanguita'' (charango and [[guitar]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://jlfeijooi.en.eresmas.com/Familia_de_los_charangos.htm The Chagango Family (Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
The charango is known by different names in various regions of the [[Andes]]. A few include:
*''Mulita'' y ''tatu'' (in [[Argentina]])
*''Kirkinchu'' (sometimes "quirquinchu") and ''kirki'' (in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]])
*''Quinquela'' (in [[Bolivia]])

There are also many dialect variants of these terms.

[[File:DVB-3DTV logo.jpg|thumb|upright = 2 | DVB 3D-TV Logo]]
'''DVB 3D-TV''' is a new standard that partially came out at the end of 2010 which included techniques and procedures to send a [[3-D film|three-dimensional video]] signal through actual [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] transmission standards ([[DVB-C|Cable]], [[DVB-T|Terrestrial]] or [[DVB-S|Satellite]]). Currently there is a commercial requirement text for [[3D television|3D TV]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] and [[Set-top box]] manufacturers, but no technical information is in there.

Nowadays 3D television technology is already in its first steps regarding its standardization, now the major 3D market is in [[Movie theater#3D|theaters]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] players with stereoscopic systems, but in the near future it will be extended to diffusion, and later [[Free viewpoint television]] will come into our homes, which means the need of new [[Video coding|coding]] and transmission standards.

== Implantation ==

The implantation of first generation of DVB 3D-TV will be staggered:

*'''Phase 1:''' the first standard will have [[forward compatibility]] with actual [[High-definition television|HD systems]] with just some [[firmware]] actualization at [[High-definition television|HD systems]] [[set-top box]]es and, of course, the need for [[3D television#TV sets|3D panels]]; however [[DVB-SI|signaling]] or distribution formats should not prevent future expansion to support new 3D encoding formats. This system only works with [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] [[DVB 3D-TV#Frame sequential|Frame sequential 3D]] systems. Requirements for this system, which is called [[Frame compatible 3DTV|Frame compatible]] format, are included in the commercial requirements of DVB. Some [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] like Sky3D&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sky.com/shop/tv/3d/ | title= Sky 3DTV site | accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Canal+3D&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.plus.es/canalplus3d | title= Canal+3D site | accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; are already using this technology, which is largely thought for [[Pay television|PayTV]].
*'''Phase 2:''' the use of new [[broadcasting]] requirements for specific 3D streams won't be compatible with actual 3D [[Set-top box|STB]], but it would be service compatible with 2D [[Set-top box|STB]] if no specific 3D [[Set-top box|STB]] is available by using [[Scalable Video Coding]] and [[Multiview Video Coding]] techniques, i.e. not having to [[simulcast]] 2D and 3D and occupying only one channel by using a unique video stream with a normal 2D base stream and an adjustable 3D depth layer. This system is called [[Service compatible 3DTV|service compatible]] and is designed for [[Free-to-air]] group of [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]].

=== Frame sequential ===

[[File:frame sequential 3D.jpg|thumb|200px | Frame sequential 3D video]]
Regarding how a signal once it's decoded is sent to the [[3d display|display]], current [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]]  systems use a '''frame-sequential 3D''' signal. Left and right frames are sent alternately to the [[3d display|display]] and by diverse systems like [[Liquid crystal shutter glasses|shuttered glasses]] or [[Polarized 3D glasses|polarized glasses]] are then shown to each eye. This involves that the real frame frequency halves the video frame frequency.

== Technical features ==

=== Frame compatible ===

In Phase 1 system, only [[DVB 3D-TV#Frame sequential|frame-sequential 3D]] is allowed, using [[Frame compatible 3DTV|frame compatible (CFC)]] format. This is made by a spatial multiplex that combines the left and right video sequences in one HD stream which is [[Video coding|coded]] with [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] as a single image. This allows to handle video as normal HD video using typical channels and interfaces like [[HDMI]], which is possible in this [[HDMI#Version 1.4|1.4a version]]. [[Frame compatible 3DTV|Frame compatible (CFC)]] model is also compatible with 2D HD mode in the same channel, adding some signalling for switching from 2D to 3D.

There are basically two ways to do spatial multiplex: Side by side and Top and bottom, but additional spatial multiplex formats have been proposed in order to improve picture quality by providing a better balance between the V and H resolution.

=== Side by side ===

[[File:side by side to FS3D.jpg|thumb|300px | Side by side format]]
'''Side by side (SbS)''' format just put the left and right images one next to the other in an HD image. Because of this, an horizontal [[Decimation (signal processing)|decimate]] is required which causes halving of horizontal definition. DVB 3D-TV supports following SbS formats:
:1080i @ 50Hz Side-by-Side
:720p @ 50Hz Side-by-Side
:720p @ 59.94 / 60 Hz Side-by-Side
:1080p @ 23.97 / 24 Hz Side-by-Side
:1080i @ 59.94 / 60 Hz Side-by-Side

=== Top and bottom ===

[[File:top and bottom to FS3D.jpg|thumb|300px | Top and bottom format]]
'''Top and Bottom (TaB)''' format put left and right images one above the other in a HD image. In this case, vertical [[Decimation (signal processing)|decimate]] is required which causes halving of vertical definition. DVB 3D-TV supports following TaB formats:
:1080p @ 23.97 / 24 Hz Top-and-Bottom
:720p @ 59.94 / 60 Hz Top-and-Bottom

* Not every spatial multiplex format is [[Frame compatible 3DTV|frame compatible]] with actual systems. Following formats are non frame compatible:
: 720p @ 50 /60 Hz
: 1080p @ 24 Hz

=== Graphics and text ===

There are basically two types of text displayed on screen that need additional [[broadcasting]] information to be displayed on a [[3D display]]:

* '''Subtitling:''' (or [[Closed captioning|captions]]) are text and visual elements that can be overlaid on the picture. The reconstruction of the composite image which includes the captions needs to be done in the [[Set-top box|STB]]. Using standards for [[Subtitle (captioning)|sub-titling]] already available for DVB [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] systems, in addition to depth information provided by the [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]], the [[Set-top box|STB]] should position correctly the [[Closed captioning|captions]] into the L and R pictures mixed with the original 3D image. The DVB 3D-TV subtitling solution will use existing [[DVB-SUB|DVB subtitling]] implementations and will be [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with 2D streams.
* '''Service guide:''' the [[Set-top box|STB]] generates multimedia content such as [[Electronic program guide|EPG]] for his service guide, which combines the use of data preloaded into the receiver with data provided by the [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]], in the form of [[DVB-SI|service information]]. Depth information will be extracted of the [[Closed captioning|captions]], displaying the graphics in the same depth.

=== Signaling ===

The main function of signaling for [[frame compatible 3DTV]] is to signal the presence of a 3D or 2D video stream. It must be also possible to include in the [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] signal information about the pixel arrangement used to [[Decimation (signal processing)|decimate]] the master [[HDTV]] full samples/line pictures to create the [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] version, if 3D is available. It's interesting to signal also for 3D receivers the 3D events that are available, for which 3D availability should appear on [[Electronic program guide|EPG]].
For future [[Service compatible 3DTV|service compatible (CSC)]] [[3D Television|3DTV]], signal that a 3D version of a 2D service or event is being [[simulcast]], and vice versa will be needed.

== 3DTV broadcast in future ==

=== Multiview ===

{{Main|Multiview Video Coding}}
Multiview video coding is a compression standard appended from [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] which allows send [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] 3D video without resolution loss due to spatial multiplex, and reducing [[Overhead information|overhead]] of sending 2 HD images up to 50% and in a single video stream. It is used in [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] players, but at the moment it's not applicable to [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] because of the processing time for [[Video coding|encoding]], which uses [[Motion compensation#3D Image Coding Techniques|motion compensation]] algorithms. Nevertheless, there have been some experiments with [[Multiview Video Coding|MVC]] 3D broadcast by [[Fraunhofer society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/image-processing/applications/stereo-3d-broadcast-with-mvc/ | title= MVC 3D signal broadcast |publisher=Fraunhofer society |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 2nd generation [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] ([[DVB-T2]], [[DVB-C2]] and [[DVB-S2]]).

=== Free viewpoint ===

{{Main|Free viewpoint television}}
Total [[Free viewpoint television]] can be reached by capturing multiple views and extracting [[2D+depth]] information from them to create a 3D model of the scene. Currently this system is being investigated, but the coding complexity and great bandwidth requirements make current [[broadcasting]] applications using [[Multiview Video Coding]] impractical, so a totally new compression scheme and capture techniques need to be investigated.

{{Music of Cuba}}
{{redirect|Danzon|the surname|Danzon (surname)}}
'''Danzón''' is the official musical genre and dance of [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="Urfé 1965"&gt;Urfé, Odilio 1965. ''El danzón''. La Habana.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an active musical form in [[Mexico]], and is still much loved in [[Puerto Rico]]. 
Written in [[Duple time|{{music|time|2|4}} time]], the danzón is a slow, formal [[partner dance]], requiring [[Sequence dance|set footwork]] around [[syncopated]] beats, and incorporating elegant pauses while the couples stand listening to virtuoso instrumental passages, as characteristically played by a [[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]] or [[Orquesta típica|tipica]] ensemble.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

The danzón evolved from the Cuban [[Habanera (music)|contradanza]], or habanera (literally, '[[Havana]]-dance'). The contradanza, which had English and French roots in the [[country dance]] and [[Quadrille|contredanse]], was probably introduced to Cuba by the Spanish, who ruled the island for almost four centuries (1511–1898), contributing many thousands of immigrants. It may also have been partially seeded during the short-lived [[History of Havana#British occupation|British occupation]] of Havana in 1762, and [[Haitian people|Haitian]] refugees fleeing the island's [[Haitian Revolution|revolution of 1791–1804]] brought the French-Haitian [[kontradans]], contributing [[Charanga (Cuba)#Origins|their own]] Creole syncopation.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel, Peter, editor, 2009. "Creolizing Contradance in the Caribbean." Philadelphia: Temple University Press; see also Carpentier, Alejo. 2001. ''Music in Cuba''. Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press. p146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boogalu/&gt; In Cuba, the dances of European origin acquired new stylistic features derived from [[African rhythm]] and [[African dance|dance]] to produce a genuine fusion of European and African influences.&lt;ref&gt;Chasteen, John Charles 2004. ''National rhythms, African roots: the deep history of Latin American popular dance''. Albuquerque, N.M. Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[African music]]al traits in the danzón include complex instrumental [[cross-rhythm]]s, expressed in staggered [[cinquillo]] and [[Tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]] patterns.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

By 1879, the year [[Miguel Failde]]'s ''Las alturas de Simpson'' was first performed (in [[Matanzas]]),&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite web| last1=Gradante | first1=William |  last2=Fairley | first2=Jan |  title=Danzón | url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/07204 | work= [[Grove Music Online]] | publisher=Oxford Music Online| quote=  | accessdate=22 October 2015}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; danzón had emerged as a distinct genre. Danzón went on to interact with 20th-century Cuban genres such as [[Son (music)|son]], and through the [[danzón-mambo]] it was instrumental in the development of [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] and [[Cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-chá]].

== History ==
[[File:CCMDonation25.JPG|thumb|left|Danzón dancers from [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]].]]
The danzón developed from the [[Contradanza|habanera]], a creolized Cuban dance form. By 1879, the year ''Las alturas de Simpson'' composed by [[Miguel Failde]] (leader of the [[Early Cuban bands#Orquesta Faílde|Orquesta Faílde]]) was first performed in [[Matanzas]],&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; danzón had emerged as a distinct genre.&lt;ref name=boogalu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boogalu.com/features/history-cuban-music |title=History of Cuban Music |accessdate=19 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201194105/http://www.boogalu.com/features/history-cuban-music |archivedate=1 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creation of the new danzón  form is generally attributed to Faílde.&lt;ref&gt;Failde, Osvalde Castillo 1964. ''Miguel Faílde: créador musical del Danzón''. Consejo Nacional de Cultura, La Habana. In 1998, the province Matanzas held a festival to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Danzón.&lt;/ref&gt; The classical composer [[Manuel Saumell]] has also been cited as a key figure in its delineation.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. ''Music in Cuba''. Minneapolis MN. p191&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Precursors: figure dances ===
The English [[contradanza]] was the predecessor of the "[[habanera (music)|habanera]]", also known as [[danza criolla]].  Out of this Creole genre, the [[Habanera (music)|Habanera]], was born in 1879 another Cuban genre, called danzon, a [[sequence dance]], in which all danced together a set of ''figures''.&lt;ref&gt;A set group of dance steps that makes up a recognized, named movement.&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the term ''danzón'', which dates from the 1850s, is for just such a dance. Havana's daily paper, ''El Triunfo'', gave a description of this earlier
danzón. It was a co-ordinated dance of figures performed by groups of Matanzas blacks. The dancers held the ends of colored ribbons, and carried flower-covered arches. The group twisted and entwined the ribbons to make pleasing patterns.&lt;ref&gt;'El danzón', article in ''El Triunfo'', 25 July 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chasteen, John Charles 2004. ''National rhythms, African roots'', p75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; This account can be corroborated by other references, for example, a traveler in Cuba noted in 1854 that black Cubans "do a kind of wreath dance, in which the whole company took part, amid innumerable artistic entanglements and disentanglements".&lt;ref&gt;Bremer, Fredrika 1853. ''The homes of the New World: impressions of America''. Harper, N.Y. vol 2, p308.&lt;/ref&gt; This style of danzón was performed at carnival [[comparsa]]s by black groups: it is described that way before the late 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;''La Aurora del Yumurí'', two articles: 'Danzón' (24.11.1871) and 'Magnifica comparsa' (2.12.1871)&lt;/ref&gt;

Faílde's first danzóns were created for just such sequence dances. Faílde himself said "In Matanzas at this time there was a kind of square dance for twenty couples who carried arches and flowers. It was really a dance of figures (sequence dance), and its moves were adapted to the tempo of the habanera, which we took over for the danzón."&lt;ref&gt;Failde, Osvalde Castillo 1964. ''Miguel Faílde: créador musical del Danzón''. p85 [rough transl. by contributor]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structure and instruments ===
The form of danzón created by Miguel Faílde in 1879 (''Las alturas de Simpson''), begins with an ''introduction'' (four bars) and ''paseo'' (four bars), which are repeated and followed by a 16-bar melody. The introduction and paseo again repeat before a second melody is played. The dancers do not dance during these sections: they choose partners, stroll onto the dance floor, and begin to dance at precisely the same moment: the fourth beat of bar four of the paseo, which has a distinctive percussion pattern that's hard to miss. When the introduction is repeated the dancers stop, chat, flirt, greet their friends, and start again, right on time as the paseo finishes.

[[Image:Peña.jpg|thumb|right|280px|&lt;center&gt;''Orquesta Enrique Peña''&lt;br&gt;Peña seated left, Barreto (violin) and Urfé (clarinet)]]

Early danzón was played by groups called ''[[Orquesta típica|orquestas típicas]]'', which were based on wind instruments. They had several brass instruments ([[cornet]], valve [[trombone]], [[ophicleide]]), a [[clarinet]] or two, a violin or two and tympani ([[kettle drums]]). At the beginning of the 20th century, the lighter and somewhat more elegant sound of the ''[[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]]'' emerged (see [[Early Cuban bands]]). Initially, they were small orchestra of two violins, a cello, flute, [[timbales]], [[güiro]], and [[doublebass]]. Charanga and típicas competed with each other for years, but after 1930 it was clear that the days of the típica were over.

In 1898, a piano was included in a charanga for the first time. In [[Antonio María Romeu]]'s hands a piano became standard. Its musical flexibility, its ability to influence both melody and rhythm, made it invaluable. In 1926, in his arrangement of ''Tres lindas cubanas'', Romeu incorporated a piano ''solo'' for the first time. His was Cuba's top charanga for many years.

=== Initial perception ===
Similar to other dances in the Caribbean and Latin America, the danzón was initially regarded as scandalous, especially when it began to be danced by all classes of society. The slower rhythm of the danzón led to couples dancing closer, with sinuous movements of the hips and a lower centre of gravity. The author of a survey of [[prostitution in Cuba|prostitution in Havana]] devoted a whole chapter to the iniquities of dancing, and the danzón in particular.&lt;ref&gt;De Cespedes, Benjamin 1888. ''La prostitución en La Habana''.&lt;/ref&gt; Articles in newspapers and periodicals took up the theme:

:"Because I love my country, it hurts me to see danzón at gatherings of decent people."&lt;ref&gt;'El danzón' articles in ''La Voz de Cuba'' (8.10.1879) and (20.11.1879); transl. from Chasteen p77.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"We recommend banning the danza and danzón because they are vestiges of Africa and should be replaced by essentially European dances such as the quadrille and rigadoon."&lt;ref&gt;'Sobre bailes' in 'La Habana elegante' (19.8.1888); transl. from Chasteen p80&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently, the danzón, which later became an insipid dance for older couples, was at first danced with "obscene movements" of the hips by young couples in close embrace, with bodies touching, and by couples who might come from different races...

:"First we had the danza, then came the danzón... next it will be the rumba, and finally we'll all end up dancing ñáñigo!"&lt;ref&gt;'El porvenir del baile en Cuba' in ''El Almendares'' (a Havana women's magazine) (7.9.1881); trans from Chasteen p81&lt;/ref&gt;

So, behind the concern about music and dance were concerns about sexual licence, and about [[miscegenation]], the mixing of races. As with other similar cases, the criticism was to no avail. The danzón became hugely popular, and was the dominant popular music in Cuba until the advent of the [[Son Cubano|son]] in the 1920s. At length the Cuban government made Faílde the official inventor of the danzón &amp;ndash; ''but not until 1960'', by which time the danzón had become a relic, and its 'child', the [[chachachá]], had taken over.&lt;ref&gt;Failde, Osvalde Castillo 1964. ''Miguel Faílde: créador musical del Danzón''. La Habana. Here the official document is reprinted in full: ''El danzón, baile nacional de Cuba''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of son ===

In 1910, some 30 years after Faílde's early days, [[José Urfé]] added a [[montuno]] as a final part of his ''El Bombín de Barretto''.&lt;ref name="Urfé 1965" /&gt; This was a swinging section, consisting of a repeated musical phrase, which introduced something of the [[Son (music)|son]] into the danzón (a tactic which was to recur again). Because of the popularity of son in the 1920s and 1930s, [[Aniceto Díaz]] in ''Rompiendo la rutina'' in 1929 added a vocal part, thereby creating a new genre called the danzonete.

[[Image:Romeu Orq.jpg|thumb|right|280px|&lt;center&gt;''Orquesta Romeu'' &lt;br /&gt; with singer Fernando Collazo, end-1920s]]

Later development led to more [[syncopation]], which eventually led to the [[danzón-chá]], [[nuevo ritmo]], [[Cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-chá]], [[pachanga]] and [[Mambo (music)|mambo]]. From the 1940s to the 1960s danzón and its derivatives were highly popular in Cuba, with several truly fine charangas playing most days of the week. [[Orquesta Aragón]] kept up an exceptionally high standard for many years, but the danzón itself gradually dropped out, and is now a relic dance.

Danzón has never ceased to influence Cuban musicians, and it is reflected in many popular Cuban music genres, in Cuban [[Latin jazz]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[songo music|songo]] and [[timba]], the latter building upon the charanga orchestration. Groups like [[Los Van Van]] and [[Orquesta Revé]] developed from charangas. Their make-up and orchestration (by [[Juan Formell]]) has been so greatly altered that it is difficult to identify traces of danzón; indeed, their present styles owe more to son than to danzón. The addition of brass instruments such as [[trombones]] and trumpets, and [[conga drum]]s signalled a wider range of music.

== Mexican Danzón ==
{{Listen|filename=danzon-veracruz.ogg|title=Danzon sound clip|description=Public danzon event on the main plaza in [[Veracruz]], Mexico.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Danzón was also very popular in the Gulf Coast state of [[Veracruz]], Mexico, because of the strong Cuban influence in the region. Later on, danzón developed in [[Mexico City]], specially in the famous ''Salón México''; it has survived as a dance longer there than in Cuba. Danzón also flourished in the city of Oaxaca, and many famous danzones were composed by Oaxacan musicians such as the famous Nereidas and Teléfono de larga distancia, both works of Amador Pérez Dimas, from the town of Zaachila, near Oaxaca city.

Today, people still dance danzón in Mexico, particularly in the main plazas of Veracruz, Oaxaca and Mexico City, and in yearly festivals across Mexico. The dance had a second revival in the 1990s, especially among Mexico's senior citizens.

A film called ''Danzón'' was released in 1991  directed by María Novaro. Plot: Julia (María Rojo) is a phone operator in Mexico City who lives for her job, her daughter and danzón. Every Wednesday, Julia does the danzón with Carmelo (Daniel Rergis) in the ''Salón Colonia''. They have danced for years without becoming close. One night, Carmelo disappears without a trace. Lonely and sad, Julia takes a train to Veracruz, where she knows Carmelo has a brother. That trip changes her life.

==Concert music==
''[[Danzón no. 2]]'' by Mexican composer [[Arturo Márquez]] (b. 1950) is a popular piece in orchestral concerts.

==Rhythmic structure==
[[File:Baqueteo-2.tif|thumb|center|350px|Basic baqueteo timbales part. {{audio|Baqueteo-2.mid|Play}}]]

The basic [[timbales]] part for danzón is called the baqueteo. In the example above, the slashed noteheads indicate muted drum strokes, and the regular noteheads indicate open strokes. The güíro also plays this pattern. The danzón was the first written music to be based on the organizing principle of sub-Saharan African rhythm, known in Cuba as [[clave rhythm|clave]].&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa, David (2010). ''The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins'' p. 254. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. {{ISBN|1-886502-80-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and form structure ==
Danzón is elegant and virtuoso music, with dance. A danzón, in its original form, was not sung, and did not feature any improvisations, unlike some other Cuban genres.
A danzón has the following typical structure:
*An ''introduction'' or ''paseo'' (A), usually 16 bars.
*The ''theme'' or principal melody (B), featuring the flute, thus often referred to as ''parte de (la) flauta''.
*A repeat of the introduction.
*The ''trio'' (C), featuring the strings, thus also called ''parte del violín''.
*Ending. This could either be a cliché ending (there are a few standard danzón endings), another repeat of the introduction, or a combination of both.
The classic form is thus ABAC or ABACA.
A [[danzón-chá]] or [[danzón-mambo]] typically add another part (D), a syncopated open vamp in which soloists may sometimes improvise, creating an ABACD or, more common, ABACAD.

== Mambo section ==
{{main|mambo section}}
In danzón, the mambo section is the final section of an arrangement. It was first devised by [[Orestes López]], who added syncopated motifs taken from the son, together with improvised flute variations.&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio 2004. ''Cuban music from A to Z''.&lt;/ref&gt; He called this type of danzón ''ritmo nuevo'' (new rhythm). Orestes' danzón ''Mambo'' was the start of a trend continued by ''[[Arcaño y sus Maravillas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Salazar]], [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FXV/is_7_12/ai_92403678 "Orestes Lopez and the mambo"], ''[[Latin Beat Magazine]]'', September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dominoes''' is a family of [[tile-based game]]s played with rectangular "domino" tiles.  Each domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its face into two square ''ends''. Each end is marked with a number of spots (also called ''[[Pip (counting)|pips]]'', ''nips'', or ''dobs'') or is blank. The backs of the dominoes in a set are indistinguishable, either blank or having some common design. The domino gaming pieces make up a domino set, sometimes called a ''deck'' or ''pack''.  The traditional Sino-European domino set consists of 28 dominoes, featuring all combinations of spot counts between zero and six. A domino set is a generic gaming device, similar to [[playing card]]s or [[dice]], in that a variety of games can be played with a set.

The earliest mention of dominoes is from [[Song dynasty]] China found in the text ''Former Events in Wulin'' by Zhou Mi (1232–1298).&lt;ref name="lo 2000"&gt;Lo, Andrew. "The Game of Leaves: An Inquiry into the Origin of Chinese Playing Cards," ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', University of London, Vol. 63, No. 3 (2000): 389-406.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern dominoes first appeared in Italy during the 18th century, but how [[Chinese dominoes]] developed into the modern game is unknown. Italian missionaries in China may have brought the game to Europe.&lt;ref name="Carl"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rodney P.

The name "domino" is most likely from the resemblance to a kind of [[Domino mask|carnival costume]] worn during the [[Venetian Carnival]], often consisting of a black-hooded robe and a white mask.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kipling.org.uk/rg_pinkdoms1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A domino is a kind of hood worn by the canons of a cathedral church. Later, the name was given to a mourning-veil for women and later still to half-masks worn by women when travelling or at a masquerade, for disguise. A domino was a masquerade-dress worn for disguise by ladies and gentlemen, and consisting of an ample cloak or mantle with wide sleeves and a hood removable at pleasure. It was usually made of black silk, but sometimes of other colours and materials.[The Probert Encyclopaedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the coinage of the word [[polyomino]] as a generalization, there is no connection between the word "domino" and the number 2 in any language.

==Construction and composition of domino sets==
European-style dominoes are traditionally made of bone or [[ivory]], or a dark hardwood such as [[ebony]], with contrasting black or white pips ([[inlay|inlaid]] or [[paint]]ed). Alternatively, domino sets have been made from many different natural materials: stone (e.g., [[marble]], [[granite]] or [[soapstone]]); other hardwoods (e.g., [[ash tree|ash]], [[oak]], [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]], and [[cedrus|cedar]]); metals (e.g., [[brass]] or [[pewter]]); [[ceramic]] clay, or even [[frosted glass]] or [[crystal]]. These sets have a more novel look, and the often heavier weight makes them feel more substantial; also, such materials and the resulting products are usually much more expensive than polymer materials. 
[[Image:Dominoes.jpg|thumb|left|Domino tiles]]
Modern commercial domino sets are usually made of synthetic materials, such as [[ABS plastic|ABS]] or [[polystyrene]] plastics, or [[Bakelite]] and other [[phenolic resin]]s; many sets approximate the look and feel of ivory while others use colored or even translucent plastics to achieve a more contemporary look. Modern sets also commonly use a different color for the dots of each different end value (one-spots might have black pips while two-spots might be green, three red, etc.) to facilitate finding matching ends. Occasionally, one may find a domino set made of card stock like that for [[playing card]]s. Such sets are lightweight, compact, and inexpensive, and like cards are more susceptible to minor disturbances such as a sudden breeze. Sometimes, dominoes have a metal pin (called a spinner or pivot) in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Western Domino Attributes|url=http://www.domino-play.com/TypeDoubleSquares.htm|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional set of dominoes contains one unique piece for each possible combination of two ends with zero to six spots, and is known as a double-six set because the highest-value piece has six pips on each end (the "double six"). The spots from one to six are generally arranged as they are on six-sided [[dice]], but because blank ends having no spots are used, seven faces are possible, allowing 28 unique pieces in a double-six set.

However, this is a relatively small number especially when playing with more than four people, so many domino sets are "extended" by introducing ends with greater numbers of spots, which increases the number of unique combinations of ends and thus of pieces. Each progressively larger set increases the maximum number of pips on an end by three, so the common extended sets are double-nine, double-12, double-15, and double-18. Larger sets such as double-21 can theoretically exist, but are rarely seen in retail stores, as identifying the number of pips on each domino becomes difficult, and a double-21 set would have 253 pieces, far more than is normally necessary for most domino games even with eight players.

==History==
{{Main article|Chinese dominoes}}
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bemanning tijdens een spel domino aan boord van een schip TMnr 60008507.jpg|thumb|Dutch sailors playing dominoes, 1890s]]
The oldest confirmed written mention of dominoes in China comes from the ''Former Events in Wulin'' (i.e., the capital [[Hangzhou]]) written by the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) author Zhou Mi (1232–1298), who listed ''pupai'' (gambling plaques or dominoes), as well as [[dice]] as items sold by peddlers during the reign of [[Emperor Xiaozong of Song]] (r. 1162–1189).&lt;ref name="lo 2000"/&gt; Andrew Lo asserts that Zhou Mi meant dominoes when referring to ''pupai'', since the Ming author [[Lu Rong]] (1436–1494) explicitly defined ''pupai'' as dominoes (in regard to a story of a suitor who won a maiden's hand by drawing out four winning ''pupai'' from a set).&lt;ref name="lo 2000"/&gt;

The earliest known manual written about dominoes is the {{lang|zh|《宣和牌譜》}} ''(Manual of the Xuanhe Period)'' written by [[Qu You]] (1341–1437),&lt;ref name="lo 2000"/&gt; but some Chinese scholars believe this manual is a forgery from a later time.&lt;ref name="《宣和牌谱》瞿佑作辨伪"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/article/ZHWL200901006.htm|date=|publisher=&lt;span lang="zh"&gt;《中华文化论坛》2009年01期&lt;/span&gt;|language=zh|script-title=zh:《宣和牌谱》瞿佑作辨伪|author=&lt;span lang="zh"&gt;乔光辉、郭威、王骏&lt;/span&gt;|accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Encyclopedia of a Myriad of Treasures'', Zhang Pu (1602–1641) described the game of laying out dominoes as ''pupai'', although the character for ''pu'' had changed, yet retained the same pronunciation.&lt;ref name="lo 2000"/&gt; Traditional Chinese domino games include ''[[Tien Gow]], [[Pai Gow]], [[Che Deng]]'', and others. The 32-piece Chinese domino set, made to represent each possible face of two thrown dice and thus have no blank faces, differs from the 28-piece domino set found [[Western world|in the West]] during the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Pickover (2002), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese dominoes with blank faces were known during the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lo, Andrew (2004) 'China's Passion for Pai: Playing Cards, Dominoes, and Mahjong.' In: Mackenzie, C. and Finkel, I., (eds.), Asian Games: The Art of Contest. New York: [[Asia Society]], pp. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different domino sets have been used for centuries in various parts of the world to play a variety of domino games.  Each domino originally represented one of the 21 results of throwing two six-sided dice (2d6). One half of each domino is set with the pips from one die and the other half contains the pips from the second die. Chinese sets also introduce duplicates of some throws and divide the dominoes into two [[Suit (cards)|suits]]: military and civil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2003|title=Pan Zhiheng's 'Xu Yezi Pu' - Part 2|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|volume=31|issue=6|pages=281–284|ref=Lo|last1=Lo|first1=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese dominoes are also longer than typical European dominoes.

The early 18th century had dominoes making their way to Europe, making their first appearance in [[Italy]]. The game changed somewhat in the translation from Chinese to the European culture. European domino sets contain neither suit distinctions nor the duplicates that went with them. Instead, European sets contain seven additional dominoes, with six of these representing the values that result from throwing a single die with the other half of the tile left blank, and the seventh domino representing the blank-blank (0–0) combination.

Ivory dominoes were routinely used in 19th-century rural England in the settling of disputes over traditional grazing boundaries, and were commonly referred to as "bonesticks".&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, Land Law in West Lancashire in the mid- 19th Century, Farm Gazette, March 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tiles and suits==
[[Image:Dominomatrix.svg|thumb|right|Complete double-six set]]

Domino tiles, also known as bones, are twice as long as they are wide and usually have a line in the middle dividing them into two squares. The value of either side is the number of spots or pips. In the most common variant (double-six), the values range from blank or no pips to six.&lt;ref name=hoyle1950&gt;{{Cite book

}}. Republished 1994 by Wordsworth Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; The sum of the two values, i.e. the total number of pips, may be referred to as the rank or weight of a tile, and a tile with more pips may be called heavier than a lighter tile with fewer pips.

Tiles are generally named after their two values; e.g. deuce-five or five-deuce (2–5 or 5–2) are alternative ways of describing the tile with the values two and five. Tiles that have the same value on both ends are called doubles, and are typically referred to as double-zero, double-one, etc.&lt;ref name=hoyle1950 /&gt; Tiles with two different values are called singles.&lt;ref name="kelleylugo2003" /&gt;

Every tile belongs to the two suits of its two values, e.g. 0–3 belongs both to the blank suit (or 0 suit) and to the 3 suit. Naturally the doubles form an exception in that each double belongs to only one suit.&lt;ref name=hoyle1950 /&gt; In [[42 (dominoes)|42]], the doubles can be treated as an additional suit of doubles, so the double-six (6–6) belongs both to the six suit and the suit of doubles.

The most common domino sets commercially available are double six (with 28 tiles) and double nine (with 55 tiles). Larger sets exist and are popular for games involving several players or for players looking for long domino games. The number of tiles in a set has the formula &lt;math&gt;\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; for a double-''n'' set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mathematics of Dominoes|url=http://www.pagat.com/tile/wdom/math.html|work=Pagat.com|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
{{See also|List of domino games}}

The most popular type of play are layout games, which fall into two main categories, blocking games and scoring games.

* Most domino games are blocking games, i.e. the objective is to empty one's hand while blocking the opponent's. In the end, a score may be determined by counting the pips in the losing players' hands.
* In scoring games, the scoring is different and happens mostly during game play, making it the principal objective.&lt;ref name="kelleylugo2003" /&gt;
* A popular version played predominantly in Singapore, referenced as Hector's Rules, allows for playing double tiles on opponents' hands and awards a bonus play of an additional tile immediately after playing a double tile. 
* If an opponent lies all his tiles on his turn, the game is a tie.

===Blocking game===
The most basic domino variant is for two players and requires a double-six set. The 28 tiles are shuffled face down and form the ''stock'' or ''boneyard''. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge in front of the players, so each player can see their own tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the opponent's hands at all times during gameplay.

One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. This tile starts the line of play, in which values of adjacent pairs of tile ends must match. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends; if a player is unable to place a valid tile, they must keep on pulling tiles from the stock until they can. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.&lt;ref name="hoyle1950" /&gt;

===Scoring game===
Players accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. If a player does not call "domino" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says domino after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino.

===Draw game===
In a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile, and they are not allowed to pass before the stock is (nearly) empty.&lt;ref name="hoyle1950" /&gt; The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock.&lt;ref name="kelleylugo2003"&gt;{{Cite book

|title=My Book of Indoor Games
|last=Squareman

|year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptations of both games can accommodate more than two players, who may play individually or in teams.&lt;ref name="hoyle1950" /&gt;

===Line of play===
[[Image:Muggins.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Muggins (domino game)|Muggins]] played with multicolored tiles: The doubles serve as spinners, allowing the line of play to branch.]]

The line of play is the configuration of played tiles on the table. It starts with a single tile and typically grows in two opposite directions when players add matching tiles. In practice, players often play tiles at right angles when the line of play gets too close to the edge of the table.

The rules for the line of play often differ from one variant to another. In many rules, the doubles serve as spinners, i.e., they can be played on all four sides, causing the line of play to branch. Sometimes, the first tile is required to be a double, which serves as the only spinner.&lt;ref name="kelleylugo2003" /&gt; In some games such as [[Chicken Foot (domino game)|Chicken Foot]], all sides of a spinner must be occupied before anybody is allowed to play elsewhere. [[Matador (domino game)|Matador]] has unusual rules for matching. [[Bendomino]] uses curved tiles, so one side of the line of play (or both) may be blocked for geometrical reasons.

In [[Mexican Train]] and other train games, the game starts with a spinner from which various trains branch off. Most trains are owned by a player and in most situations players are allowed to extend only their own train.

===Scoring===
In blocking games, scoring happens at the end of the game. After a player has emptied their hand, thereby winning the game for the team, the score consists of the total pip count of the losing team's hands. In some rules, the pip count of the remaining stock is added. If a game is blocked because no player can move, the winner is often determined by adding the pips in players' hands.&lt;ref name="kelleylugo2003" /&gt;

In scoring games, each individual can potentially add to the score. For example, in [[Bergen (domino game)|Bergen]], players score two points whenever they cause a configuration in which both open ends have the same value and three points if additionally one open end is formed by a double.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bergen|publisher=domino-games.com|url=http://www.domino-games.com/domino-rules/bergen-rules.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bergen|publisher=pagat.com|url=http://www.pagat.com/tile/wdom/bergen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Muggins, players score by ensuring the total pip count of the open ends is a multiple of a certain number. In variants of Muggins, the line of play may branch due to spinners.

In British public houses and social clubs, a scoring version of "5s-and-3s" is used. The game is normally played in pairs (two against two) and is played as a series of "ends". In each "end", the objective is for players to attach a domino from their hand to one end of those already played so that the sum of the end dominoes is divisible by five or three. One point is scored for each time five or three can be divided into the sum of the two dominoes, i.e. four at one end and five at the other makes nine, which is divisible by three three times, resulting in three points. Double five at one end and five at the other makes 15, which is divisible by three five times (five points) and divisible by five three times (three points) for a total of eight points.

An "end" stops when one of the players is out, i.e., has played all of their dominoes. In the event no player is able to empty their hand, then the player with the lowest domino left in hand is deemed to be out and scores one point. A game consists of any number of ends with points scored in the ends accumulating towards a total. The game ends when one of the pair's total score exceeds a set number of points. A running total score is often kept on a [[cribbage]] board. 5s-and-3s is played in a number of competitive leagues in the British Isles.

===Variations and game play===
{{One source|section|date=June 2018}}
For 40 years the game has been played by four people, with the winner being the first player to score 150 points, in multiples of five, by using 27 bones, using mathematical strategic defenses and explosive offense. At times, it has been played with pairs of partners. The double-six set is the preferred deck with the lowest denomination of game pieces, with 28 dominoes.

In many versions of the game, the player with the highest double leads with that double, for example "double-six". If no one has it, the next-highest double is called: "double-five?", then "double-four?", etc. until the highest double in any of the players' hands is played. If no player has an "opening" double, the next heaviest domino in the highest suit is called - "six-five?", "six-four?". In some variants, players take turns picking dominoes from the stock until an opening double is picked and played. In other variants, the hand is reshuffled and each player picks seven dominoes. After the first hand, the winner (or winning team) of the previous hand is allowed to pick first and begins by playing any domino in his or her hand.

Playing the first bone of a hand is sometimes called setting, leading, downing, or posing the first bone. Dominoes aficionados often call this procedure smacking down the bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://domino-play.com/glossary.htm|title=Domino Glossary|website=domino-play.com|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After each hand, bones are shuffled and each player draws the number of bones required, normally seven. Play proceeds clockwise. Players, in turn, must play a bone with an end that matches one of the open ends of the layouts.

In some versions of the games, the pips or points on the end, and the section to be played next to it must add up to a given number. For example, in a double-six set, the "sum" would be six, requiring a blank to be played next to a six, an ace (one) next to a five, a deuce (two) next to a four, etc.

The stock of bones left behind, if any, is called the bone yard, and the  bones therein are said to be sleeping. In draw games, players take part in the bone selection, typically drawing from the bone yard when they do not have a "match" in their hands.

If a player inadvertently picks up and sees one or more extra dominoes, those dominoes become part of his or her hand.

A player who can play a tile may be allowed to pass anyway.&lt;!-- What is the rule here? --&gt; Passing can be signalled by tapping twice on the table or by saying "go" or "pass".

Play continues until one of the players has played all the dominoes in his or her hand, calls "Out!", "I win", or "Domino!" and wins the hand, or until all players are blocked and no legal plays remain. This is sometimes referred to as locked down or sewed up. In a common version of the game, the next player after the block picks up all the dominoes in the bone yard as if trying to find a (nonexistent) match. If all the players are blocked, or locked out, the player with the lowest hand (pip count) wins. In team play, the team with the lowest individual hand wins. In the case of a tie, the first of tied players or the first ''team'' in the play rotation wins.

In games where points accrue, the winning player scores a point for each pip on each bone still held by each opponent or the opposing team. If no player went out, the win is determined by the lightest hand, sometimes only the excess points held by opponents.

A game is generally played to 100 points, the tally being kept on paper. In more common games, mainly urban rules, games are played to 150, 200, or 250 points.
[[File:Scoring Houses.jpeg|alt=scoring houses|thumb|Score being kept by houses: The player at left has 75 points and the player at right has 115 points.]]
In some games, the tally is kept by creating [[:File:Scoring Houses.jpeg|houses]], where the beginning of the house (the first 10 points) is a large [[+]], the next 10 points are [[O]], and scoring with a five is a [[/]], and are placed in the four corners of the house. One house is equal to 50 points.

In some versions, if a lock down occurs, the first person to call a lock-down gains the other players bones and adds the amount of the pips to his or her house. If a person who calls rocks after a call of lock-down or domino finds the number of pips a player called is incorrect, those points become his.

===Bogus play===
When a player plays out of turn or knocks when he could have played and someone calls bogus play, the other person is awarded 50 points.

===Card games using domino sets===
Apart from the usual blocking and scoring games, also domino games of a very different character are played, such as solitaire or trick-taking games. Most of these are adaptations of [[card game]]s and were once popular in certain areas to circumvent religious proscriptions against [[playing card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

A very simple example is a [[Concentration (game)|Concentration]] variant played with a double-six set; two tiles are considered to match if their total pip count is 12.

A popular domino game in [[Texas]] is [[42 (dominoes)|42]]. The game is similar to the card game [[spades]]. It is played with four players paired into teams. Each player draws seven dominoes, and the dominoes are played into tricks. Each trick counts as one point, and any domino with a multiple of five dots counts toward the total of the hand. These 35 points of "five count" and seven tricks equals 42 points, hence the name.&lt;!---

The following seems to be just a slightly spiced up standard variant of the 4 player Block game with empty stock.Part of this information may be worth including elsewhere, but it doesn't really belong into an "other games" section.

Also, in the Caribbean, there are other common games which involve four players in which the players can play as partners or as individuals. In partners, the partners sit across from each other and all hands can not be seen by the other players. The game is started by shuffling the dominoes or 'cards' and each player pulling seven cards. The double six is then played and play continues to the starter's right side. If a player can not play then he is passed and it is the next player's turn. The object is for a team to win by one of the players running out of dominoes. The winning team is awarded a point and then restart the process by shuffling and pulling a new hand and then starting with any domino either partner wishes to play. The game goes on till one team reaches six points. Double points are awarded when you get 'key'. This happens when your last card is the only card that can be played on both ends. Also when a player pulls five doubles all players put their dominoes back and pull new hands, the following game is played for 2 points and the double six is started by the player who has it. This variation is called Partners, where the other variation is called Cut-Throat (or 'pin-tin tin' in the Dominican Republic), where each player plays for himself, in which all the same rules apply as in partners. This form of dominoes is most common in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]] and the [[Cayman Islands]].

[[Dominican Republic]] is know to have the best Dominos players in the world.

==Competitive play==
[[File:Abkhazia 10 apsar Ag 2011 Domino b.jpg|thumb|left|150px| Commemorative Coin of the 2011 Domino World Championship in Abkhazia]] 
Dominoes is played at a professional level, similar to poker. Numerous organisations and clubs of amateur domino players exist around the world. Some organizations, including the ''Fédération Internationale de Domino (FIDO)''&lt;ref&gt;http://domino-fid.org/&lt;/ref&gt; organize international competitions. The 2008 and 2009 Double FIDO domino world champion from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] is Darren Elhindi.

==Other uses of dominoes==
[[Image:Domino Cascade.JPG|thumb|Dominoes in motion]]
[[Image:Toppledominos.jpg|thumb|Dominoes waiting to fall]]

Besides playing games, another use of dominoes is the [[domino show]], which involves standing them on end in long lines so that when the first tile is toppled, it topples the second, which topples the third, etc., resulting in all of the tiles falling. By analogy, the phenomenon of small events causing similar events leading to eventual catastrophe is called the [[domino effect]].

Arrangements of millions of tiles have been made that have taken many minutes, even hours to fall. For large and elaborate arrangements, special blockages (also known as firebreaks) are employed at regular distances to prevent a premature toppling from undoing more than a section of the dominoes while still being able to be removed without damage.

The phenomenon also has some theoretical relevance ([[amplifier]], [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]], [[information processing]]),&lt;ref name=domcom&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1764437 Domino computer]&lt;/ref&gt; and this amounts to the theoretical possibility of building [[domino computer]]s.&lt;ref name=comdomcon&gt;[http://www.pinkandaint.com/oldhome/comp/dominoes/index.html Domino computers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060816075615/http://www.pinkandaint.com/oldhome/comp/dominoes/index.html |date=16 August 2006 }}, a detailed description written by [http://www.pinkandaint.com/ David Johnston]&lt;/ref&gt; Dominoes are also commonly used as components in [[Rube Goldberg machine]]s.

The Netherlands has hosted an annual domino-toppling exhibition called [[Domino Day]] since 1986. The event held on 18 November 2005 knocked over 4 million dominoes by a team from [[Weijers Domino Productions]]. On Domino Day 2008 (14 November 2008), the Weijers Domino Productions team attempted to set 10 records:&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7730834.stm |title=World domino record set on TV |accessdate=18 November 2008|work=BBC News | date=15 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This record attempt was held in the {{ill|WTC Expo hall|nl|WTC Leeuwarden}} in [[Leeuwarden]]. The artist who toppled the first stone was the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[acrobatics|acrobat]] [[Salima Peippo]].

At one time, [[Pressman Toy Corp.|Pressman Toys]] manufactured a product called [[Domino Rally]] that contained tiles and mechanical devices for setting up toppling exhibits.

In Berlin on 9 November 2009, giant dominoes were toppled in a 20th-anniversary commemoration of the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]]. Former Polish president and [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] leader [[Lech Wałęsa]] set the toppling in motion.

==Dominoes in Unicode==
{{Main article|Domino Tiles|l1=Domino Tiles (Unicode block)}}

Since April 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |date=4 April 2008 |publisher=Unicode Consortium |url=https://www.unicode.org/press/pr-5.1.html |title=Unicode Version 5.1 Released |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127061209/http://unicode.org/press/pr-5.1.html |archivedate=27 January 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the character encoding standard [[Unicode]] includes characters that represent the double-six domino tiles in various orientations. All combinations of blank through six pips on the left or right provides 49 glyphs, the same combinations vertically for another 49, and also a horizontal and a vertical "back" for a total of 100 glyphs. In this arrangement, both orientations are present: horizontally both tiles [1|6] and [6|1] exist, while a regular game set only has one such tile. The Unicode range for dominoes is U+1F030&amp;ndash;U+1F09F. The naming pattern in Unicode is, by example, {{unichar|1F03B|DOMINO TILE HORIZONTAL-01-03}}. Few fonts are known to support these glyphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/domino_tiles/fontsupport.htm|title=Fontsupport|accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the complete domino set has only 28 tiles, for printing layout reasons, the Unicode set needs both horizontal and vertical forms for each tile, plus the 01-03 (plain) 03-01 (reversed) pairs, and generic backsides.

'''''EarthBound''''', also known as '''''Mother 2''''' in Japan,{{refn|group=nb|{{nihongo|MOTHER2ギーグの逆襲}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MOTHER2　ギーグの逆襲／EarthBound / ハル研究所|url=http://www.hallab.co.jp/eng/works/detail/002738/|work=[[HAL Laboratory]]|accessdate=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n02/shvc/mb/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a 1994 [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese role-playing video game]] co-developed by [[Creatures (company)|Ape Inc.]] and [[HAL Laboratory]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] video game console. As Ness and his [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] of four, the player travels the world to collect the 8 melodies in order to defeat the evil alien force [[Giygas]]. It is the second game of the [[Mother (video game series)|''Mother'' series]] and the first and only to be released outside of Japan for two decades. ''EarthBound'' was released in Japan in August 1994, and in North America the next June.

The game had a lengthy development period that spanned five years. Its returning staff from ''[[Mother (video game)|Mother]]'' (1989) included writer/director [[Shigesato Itoi]] and lead programmer [[Satoru Iwata]] (later the president of Nintendo), as well as composers [[Keiichi Suzuki]] and [[Hirokazu Tanaka]]. Suzuki and Tanaka incorporated a diverse range of [[popular music|popular]] and [[world music|exotic]] styles into [[EarthBound soundtrack|the soundtrack]], including [[salsa music|salsa]], [[reggae]], and [[dub music]], and wrote enough music as to fill two compact discs. Most of the other staff members had not worked on the original ''Mother'', and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until Iwata joined the team. Originally scheduled for release in January 1993, the game was completed around May 1994. 

Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of [[Americana]] and [[Western culture]], ''EarthBound'' subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a [[reality|real world]] setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre. Itoi wanted it to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone; for example, the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues, experiences in-game hallucinations, and battles piles of vomit, [[taxi cab]]s, and walking nooses. Upon release, it was marketed with a $2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed "this game stinks". Japanese-to-English localizer [[Marcus Lindblom]] reworked the original puns and humor for the game's American release while adding private jokes and various allusions to Western pop culture. Its title, "''Mother&amp;nbsp;2''", was changed to "''EarthBound''" to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.

Initial reviewers had little praise for ''EarthBound'' in the United States, where it sold half as many copies as in Japan. Critics attribute this to a combination of the game's simple graphics, the satirical marketing campaign, and a lack of market interest in the genre. In the ensuing years, a [[EarthBound fandom|dedicated fan community]] spawned which advocated for the series. Starting in 1999, Ness became a featured character in each of the [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]] of video games which helped popularize ''EarthBound''. By the 2000s, the game had become regarded as a "[[sacred cow (idiom)|sacred cow]] amongst gaming's cognoscenti",{{r|Eurogamer: M3 review}} with multiple reader polls ranking it among the best of all time. A Japan-only sequel, ''[[Mother 3]]'', was released for the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2006. In 2013, ''EarthBound'' was given a worldwide release on the [[Wii U]] [[Virtual Console]] following many years of fan lobbying, marking its debut in many territories including Europe.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Mother 2 Summers.png|left|thumb|Ness, Paula, Jeff, and Poo (right to left) walking the Summers beachfront]]
''EarthBound'' features many traditional role-playing game elements: the player controls a party of characters who travel through the game's [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[Fictional universe|world]] composed of villages, cities, caves, and dungeons. Along the way, the player fights battles against enemies and the party receives [[experience point]]s for victories.&lt;ref name = "EB battle"&gt;{{cite book | title = EarthBound Player's Guide | editor = Nintendo of America | publisher = [[Nintendo of America, Inc.]] | pages = 10, 11 | year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; If enough experience points are acquired, a character's level will increase. This pseudo-randomly increases the character's attributes, such as offense, defense, and the maximum [[Health (game mechanic)#Hit points|hit points (HP)]] and [[magic (gaming)|psychic points (PP)]] of each character. Rather than using an [[overworld]] map screen like most console RPGs of its era, the world is entirely seamless, with no differentiation between towns and the outside world.{{r|Famitsu: Itoi}} Another non-traditional element is the perspective used for the world. The game uses [[oblique projection]], while most 2D RPGs use a "top down" view on a grid or an [[isometric perspective]].&lt;ref name="1UP: Retronauts 5"/&gt;

Unlike its predecessor, ''EarthBound'' does not use [[random encounter]]s. When physical contact occurs between a character and an enemy, the screen dissolves into battle mode. In combat, characters and enemies possess a certain amount of HP. Blows to an enemy reduce the amount of HP. Once an enemy's HP reach zero, that enemy is defeated. If a specific type of enemy is defeated, there is a chance that the character will receive an item after the battle. In battle, the player is allowed to choose specific actions for their characters. These actions can include attacking, healing, spying (reveals enemy weakness/strengths), mirroring (emulate a specific enemy), and running away. Characters can also use special PSI attacks that require PP. Once each character is assigned a command, the characters and enemies perform their actions in a set order, determined by character speed. Whenever a character receives damage, the HP box gradually "rolls" down, similar to an [[odometer]]. This allows players an opportunity to heal the character or win the battle before the counter hits zero, after which the character is knocked unconscious.{{refn|group=nb|If the counter reaches zero as the battle is won, it will be set to 1 HP instead and the character will survive.}} If all characters are rendered unconscious, the game transitions to an endgame screen, asking if the player wants to continue. An affirmative response brings Ness, conscious, back to the last telephone he saved from, with half the money on his person at the time of his defeat, and with other party members showing as still unconscious. Because battles are not random, tactical advantages can be gained. If the player physically contacts an enemy from behind (indicated by a translucent green swirl which fills the screen), the player is given a first-strike priority. However, this also applies to enemies, who can also engage the party from behind (in this case, the swirl is red). Neutral priority is indicated by a blue swirl. Additionally, as Ness and his friends become stronger, battles with weaker enemies are eventually won automatically, forgoing the battle sequence, and weaker monsters will begin to flee from Ness and his friends rather than chase them.&lt;ref name = "EB battle"/&gt;

Currency is indirectly received from Ness' father, who can also [[saved game|save the game's progress]]. Each time the party wins a battle, Ness' father deposits money in an account that can be withdrawn at [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]]. In towns, players can visit various stores where weapons, armor, and items can be bought. Weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense, respectively. In addition, items can be used for a number of purposes, such as healing. Towns also contain several other useful facilities such as hospitals where players can be healed for a fee.&lt;ref name = "EB Other"&gt;{{cite book | title = EarthBound Player's Guide | editor = Nintendo of America | publisher = [[Nintendo of America, Inc.]] | page = 12 | year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
''EarthBound'' takes place about a decade after the events of ''Mother'', in the fictional country of Eagleland. The player starts as a young boy named Ness{{refn|group=nb|Players are asked to name their characters at the beginning of the game.&lt;ref name="USgamer: the deal"/&gt;}} as he investigates a nearby meteorite crash&lt;ref name="GameZone review"/&gt; with his neighbor, Pokey,&lt;ref name="IGN: 10 MMM"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|While named Pokey in ''EarthBound'', he is named Porky in the Japanese version. This also applies in ''Mother 3''. In Japanese versions of both his name is ポーキー ''Pōkī''&lt;ref name="IGN: 10 MMM"/&gt;}} to find his brother Picky. They find that an alien force, [[Giygas]], has enveloped and consumed the world in hatred and consequently turned animals, humans, and objects into malicious creatures. A small, bee-like creature from the future instructs Ness to collect melodies in a Sound Stone to preemptively stop the force,&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Trippiest"/&gt; but is killed shortly thereafter when Pokey and Picky's mother mistakes him for a pest. While visiting these eight Sanctuaries,&lt;ref name="IGN: 10 MMM"/&gt; Ness meets three other kids named Paula, Jeff, and Poo – "a psychic girl, an eccentric inventor, and a ponytailed martial artist", respectively&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Trippiest"/&gt; – who join his [[Party (role-playing games)|party]].&lt;ref name="GameZone review"/&gt; Along the way, Ness visits the cultists of Happy Happy Village, where he saves Paula, and the zombie-infested Threed, where the two of them fall prey to a trap. After Paula telepathically instructs Jeff in a Winters boarding school to rescue them, they continue to Saturn Valley, a village filled with a species of creatures called Mr. Saturn, the city of Fourside, and the [[seaside resort]] Summers. Meanwhile, Poo, the prince of Dalaam, partakes in a seemingly violent meditation called "[[Mu (negative)|Mu]] Training" before joining the party as well.&lt;ref name="IGN: 10 MMM"/&gt;

The party continues to travel to the Scaraba desert, the Deep Darkness swamp, another village of creatures called Tenda who need a book to overcome their shyness, and a forgotten underworld where dinosaurs live. When the Sound Stone is eventually filled,&lt;ref name="Tilden"/&gt; Ness visits Magicant, a surreal location in his mind where he fights his personal dark side.&lt;ref name="IGN: 10 MMM"/&gt; Upon returning to Eagleland, Ness and his party use the Phase Distorter to travel back in time to fight Giygas, transferring their souls into robots. The group discovers a device that contains the alien, but it is being guarded by Pokey, who is revealed to have been helping Giygas all along. After defeating him in a fight, Pokey turns the device off, releasing Giygas and forcing the group to fight{{sfn|Tilden|1995|pp=116–119}} the monster. During the fight, Paula reaches out to the inhabitants of Earth, who pray for the children's safety. The prayers manage to exploit Giygas' fatal weakness – human emotions – and defeat the alien, eradicating him from all of existence.&lt;ref name="IGN: 10 MMM"/&gt; In a [[post-credits scene]], Ness, whose life has returned to normal following Giygas' defeat, receives a note from Pokey, who challenges Ness to come and find him.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Trippiest"/&gt;

The first ''Mother'' was released for the NES in 1989.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt; Its sequel, ''Mother 2'', or ''EarthBound'', was developed over five years&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Itoi"/&gt; by Ape (later [[Creatures (company)|Creatures]]&lt;ref name="Nintendo: Ape/Creatures"/&gt;) and [[HAL Laboratory|HAL]], and published through [[Nintendo]].&lt;ref name="IGN: top SNES"/&gt; The game was written and designed by Japanese author, musician, and advertiser [[Shigesato Itoi]],&lt;ref name="ONM review"/&gt; and produced by [[Satoru Iwata]], who became Nintendo's president and CEO.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Quash"/&gt; ''Mother 2'' was made with a development team different from that of the original game,&lt;ref name="1101: cancel"/&gt; and most of its members were unmarried and willing to work all night on the project.&lt;ref name="DREAM-07"/&gt; ''Mother 2''{{'s}} development took much longer than planned and came under repeated threat of cancellation.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Itoi"/&gt; Itoi has said that the project's dire straits were resolved when Iwata joined the team.&lt;ref name="1101: cancel"/&gt; Ape's programming team had more members than HAL on the project. The HAL team (led by lead programmer Iwata) worked on the game programming, while the Ape team (led by lead programmer Kouji Malta) worked on specific data, such as the text and maps. They spent biweekly retreats together at the HAL office in view of [[Mount Fuji]].&lt;ref name="Famitsu: 1994 Sept 9"/&gt;

The game continues ''Mother''{{'s}} story in that Giygas reappears as the antagonist (and thus did not die at the end of ''Mother'') and the player has the option of choosing whether to continue the protagonist's story by choosing whether to name their player-character the same as the original.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: 1994 June"/&gt; He considered interstellar and [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary space travel]] instead of the confines of a single planet in the new game. After four months, Itoi scrapped the idea as cliché. Itoi sought to make a game that would appeal to populations that were playing games less, such as girls.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Itoi"/&gt;

The [[Mother (video game series)|''Mother'' series]] titles are built on what Itoi considered "reckless wildness", where he would offer ideas that encouraged his staff to contribute new ways of portraying scenes in the video game medium.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Trippiest"/&gt; He saw the titles foremost as games and not "big scenario scripts".&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Trippiest"/&gt; Itoi has said that he wanted the player feel emotions such as "distraught" when playing the game.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Trippiest"/&gt; The game's writing was intentionally "quirky and goofy" in character,&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt; and written in the Japanese [[kana]] script so as to give dialogue a conversational feel. Itoi thought of the default player-character names when he did not like his team's suggestions. Many of the characters were based on real life personalities. For instance, the desert miners were modeled on specific executives from a Japanese construction company.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Itoi"/&gt; The final battle dialogue with Giygas was based on Itoi's recollections of a traumatic scene from the [[Shintoho]] film ''[[Kenpei to barabara shibijin|The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty]]'' that he had accidentally seen in his childhood.&lt;ref name="1101: trauma"/&gt; Itoi referred to the battle background animations as a "video drug".&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Itoi"/&gt; The same specialist made nearly 200 of these animations, working solely on backgrounds for two years.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Itoi"/&gt;

The idea for the rolling HP meter began with [[pachinko]] balls that would drop balls off the screen upon being hit. This did not work as well for characters with high [[Health (gaming)|health]]. Instead, around 1990, they chose an odometer-style hit points counter.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Itoi"/&gt; The bicycle was one of the harder elements to implement&lt;ref name="Famitsu: 1994 Sept 9"/&gt;—it used controls similar to a tank before it was tweaked.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Itoi"/&gt; Iwata felt that the Ape programmers were particularly willing to tackle such challenges. The programmers also found difficulty implementing the in-game delivery service, where the delivery person had to navigate around obstacles to reach the player. They thought it would be funny to have the delivery person run through obstacles in a hurry on his way off-screen.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: 1994 Sept 9"/&gt; The unusual maps laid out with diagonal streets in [[oblique projection]] required extra attention from the artists. Itoi specifically chose against having an [[overworld]] map, and didn't want to artificially distinguish between towns and other areas. Instead, he worked to make each town unique. His own favorite town was Threed, though it was Summers before then.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Itoi"/&gt;

''Mother 2'' was designed to fit within an eight megabit limit, but was expanded in size and scope twice: first to 12 megabits and second to 24 megabits.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Itoi"/&gt; The game was originally scheduled for release in January 1993 on a 12 megabit cartridge.&lt;ref name="SFM 1992"/&gt; It was finished around May 1994&lt;ref name="Famitsu: 1994 Sept 9"/&gt; and the Japanese release was set for August 27, 1994.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: 1994 July"/&gt; With the extra few months, the team played the game and added small, personal touches.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: 1994 Sept 9"/&gt; Itoi told ''[[Weekly Famitsu]]'' that [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] liked the game and that it was the first role-playing game that Miyamoto had completed.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Itoi"/&gt; ''Mother 2'' would release in North America about a year later.&lt;ref name="Shacknews: EarthBotched"/&gt;

=== Music ===
{{See also|EarthBound soundtrack}}

''Mother'' composers [[Keiichi Suzuki]] and [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] returned to make the ''EarthBound'' soundtrack, along with newcomers Hiroshi Kanazu and Toshiyuki Ueno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EarthBound Credits|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/earthbound/credits|website=Mobygames.com|publisher=Mobygames|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RPGFan: soundtrack"/&gt; In comparison with ''Mother'', Itoi said that ''EarthBound'' had more "jazzy" pieces.{{r|Famitsu: Itoi}} Suzuki told ''Weekly Famitsu'' that the Super NES afforded the team more creative freedom with its eight-channel [[ADPCM]] based [[SPC700]], as opposed to the old Nintendo Entertainment System's restriction of five channels of basic [[waveform]]s. This entailed higher sound quality and music that sounds closer to his regular compositions.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Suzuki"/&gt; Itoi believes that ''EarthBound'' may be the first video game to use [[vibrato]], or "string-bending", in its music.{{r|Famitsu: Itoi}} The soundtrack was released by [[Sony Records]] on November 2, 1994.&lt;ref name="RPGFan: soundtrack"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|It was later reprinted by Sony Music Direct on February 18, 2004.&lt;ref name="RPGFan: soundtrack"/&gt;}}

In Suzuki's songwriting process, he would first compose on a [[synthesizer]] before working with programmers to get it in the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite piece is the music that plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it was not included in the game.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Suzuki"/&gt; The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge—about two compact discs.&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Itoi"/&gt;

[[File:Beach Boys 1967 (cropped).jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[The Beach Boys]] were one of many Western artists Suzuki and Tanaka drew inspiration from while developing the game's soundtrack.]]

According to Tanaka, [[the Beach Boys]] were repeatedly referenced between him and Suzuki, and that he would often listen to co-founder [[Brian Wilson]]'s [[Brian Wilson (album)|1988 eponymous album]] while on the way to Suzuki's home.&lt;ref name="1101: music"/&gt; Suzuki has stated that the [[Percussion notation|percussive arranging]] in the game's soundtrack was based on the Beach Boys' albums ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' (unreleased) and ''[[Smiley Smile]]'' (1967), which both contained American themes shared with [[Van Dyke Parks]]' ''[[Song Cycle (album)|Song Cycle]]'' (1968). To Suzuki, ''Smile'' evoked the bright and dark aspects of America, while ''Song Cycle'' displayed a hazy sound mixed with [[American humor]] and hints of [[Ray Bradbury]], a style which he considered essential to the soundtrack of ''Mother''.&lt;ref name="1101: music"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Within a year following the game's release, Keiichi Suzuki recorded a [[cover version]] of the Beach Boys' "[[Good Vibrations]]" (1966), a product of the band's ''Smile'' album where Parks served as a primary lyricist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discography / Others|url=http://www.keiichisuzuki.com/discography/others/|website=keiichisuzuki.com|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Tanaka recalls [[Randy Newman]] being the first quintessentially American composer he could think of, and that his albums ''[[Little Criminals]]'' (1977) and ''[[Land of Dreams (album)|Land of Dreams]]'' (1988) were influential.&lt;ref name="1101: music"/&gt; While Suzuki corroborated with his own affinity for [[Harry Nilsson]]'s ''[[Nilsson Sings Newman]]'' (1970),&lt;ref name="1101: music"/&gt; he also cited [[John Lennon]] as a strong influence due to the common theme of love in his music, which was also a prominent theme in the game,&lt;ref name="Famitsu: Suzuki"/&gt; and that his album ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'' (1970) helped him to avoid excessive instrumentation over the SNES's technical constraints.&lt;ref name="1101: music"/&gt;

The soundtrack contains direct [[musical quotation]]s of some [[classical music|classical]] and [[folk music]]; the composers also derived a few [[sampling (music)|samples]] culled from other sources including commercial [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]].&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|These quotations and samples are believed to include [[the Beach Boys]] ("[[Deirdre (song)|Deirdre]]"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beatles, Beach Boys and Monty Python really were in Earthbound|url=http://www.destructoid.com/the-beatles-beach-boys-and-monty-python-really-were-in-earthbound-277313.phtml|website=Destructoid|accessdate=July 21, 2014|date=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[the Beatles]] ("[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]"), [[the Who]] ("[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]"), [[Antonín Dvořák]] ([[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|Symphony No. 9]]), [[Ric Ocasek]] ("[[This Side of Paradise (album)|This Side of Paradise]]"), [[the Doors]] ("[[L.A.

Additionally, he felt that the [[mix tape]] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine Presents: Music Futurists]]'' (1999) presented a particular selection of artists which embody the ethos of ''EarthBound'', running the gamut from [[Space Age]] composer [[Juan García Esquivel|Esquivel]] to [[Experimental music|avant-garde]] [[trumpet]]er [[Ben Neill]], along with innovators [[Sun Ra]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Brian Eno]], and [[Can (band)|Can]].&lt;ref name="1101: music"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|The compilation operates under the premise of [[pop art]]ists "on the cutting edge of technology in music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearson|first1=Paul|title=Wired Magazine Presents: Music Futurists|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/wired-magazine-presents-music-futurists-mw0000048006|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Tanaka also mentioned that he listened to the various artists compilation ''[[Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films]]'' (1988) heavily during ''EarthBound'''s development.&lt;ref name="1101: music"/&gt; Miscellaneous influences on Suzuki and Tanaka for ''EarthBound'' include the music of [[Michael Nyman]], [[Miklós Rózsa]]'s [[film score]] for ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), and albums by various other pop/rock musicians.&lt;ref name="1101: music"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|They include [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s ''[[Around the World in a Day]]'' (1985) and ''[[Sign o' the Times]]'' (1987), [[Godley &amp; Creme]]'s ''[[Consequences (Godley &amp; Creme album)|Consequences]]'' (1977), [[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s ''[[People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm]]'' (1990), [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]'s ''[[Loveless (My Bloody Valentine album)|Loveless]]'' (1991)&lt;ref name="1101: music"/&gt;}}

[[File:Magicant.jpg|right|thumb|In the original ''Mother 2'', Ness walks naked through his dream town Magicant.  In the U.S. release this was changed to his pajamas without his cap.]]
As was traditional for Nintendo, ''Mother 2'' was developed in Japan and [[Game localization|localized]] in the United States, a process in which the game is translated into English for Western audiences.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt; As the only game in the ''Mother'' series to be released in North America at the time,&lt;ref name="IGN: top SNES"/&gt; its title "''Mother&amp;nbsp;2''" was changed to "''EarthBound''" to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt;

Nintendo of America's [[Dan Owsen]] began the English localization project and converted about ten percent of the script before moving to another project.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt; [[Marcus Lindblom]] filled Owsen's position around January 1995.&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt; Lindblom credits Owsen with coining some of the game's "most iconic phrases", such as "say fuzzy pickles".&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt; Lindblom himself was given liberties to make the script "as weird as [he] wanted", as Nintendo wanted the script to be more American than a direct translation would be.&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt; He worked alone and with great latitude due to no divisional hierarchies.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Quash"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|While working alone was standard for localizers of the era, later localization efforts had full departments.&lt;ref name="Polygon: Quash"/&gt;}} Lindblom was aided by Japanese writer Masayuki Miura, who translated the Japanese script and contextualized its tone,&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt; which Lindblom positively described as "a glass half full".&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt;

Lindblom was challenged by the task of culturally translating "an outsider's view of the U.S." for an American audience.&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt; He also sought to stay true to the original text, though he never met or spoke with Itoi.&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt; In addition to reworking the original puns and humor, Lindblom added private jokes and American cultural allusions to [[Bugs Bunny]], comedian [[Benny Hill]], and ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt; Apart from the dialogue, he wrote the rest of the game's text, including combat prompts and item names.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt; As one of several [[Easter egg (video games)|Easter eggs]], he named a [[non-player character]] for his daughter, Nico, who was born during development. While Lindblom took the day off for her birth,&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt; he proceeded to work 14-hour days&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt; without weekends for the next month.&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt; The game also includes [[copy protection|protection against piracy]] that, when triggered, increases enemy counts to make the game less enjoyable. Additionally, right before players reach the end of the pirated copy's story, their game resets and deletes its saved file in an act that IGN declared "arguably the most devious and notorious example of 'creative' copy protection".&lt;ref name="IGN: anti-piracy"/&gt;

Under directives from Nintendo,&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt; Lindblom worked with the Japanese artists and programmers&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt; to remove references to intellectual property, religion, and alcohol from the American release, such as a truck's [[Coca-Cola]] logo, the [[red cross]]es on hospitals, and [[Christian cross|crosses on tombstones]].&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt; Alcohol became coffee, Ness was no longer nude in the Magicant area as seen in the image,&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt; and the Happy Happyist blue cultists were made to look less like [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen.&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt; The team was not concerned with music licensing issues and considered itself somewhat protected under the guise of [[parody]].&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt; Lindblom recalled that the music did not need many changes. The graphical fixes were not finished until March 1995, and the game was not fully playable until May.&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt;

''EarthBound'' was released on June 5, 1995 in North America.&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt; Though Nintendo spent about $2 million on marketing,&lt;ref name="ONM review"/&gt; the American release was ultimately viewed as unsuccessful within Nintendo.&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt; The game's atypical marketing campaign was derived from the game's unusual humor. As part of Nintendo's larger "Play It Loud" campaign, ''EarthBound''{{'s}} "this game stinks" campaign included foul-smelling [[scratch and sniff]] advertisements.&lt;ref name="Shacknews: EarthBotched"/&gt; ''1UP.com'' called the scratch and sniff advertising campaign "infamously ill-conceived",&lt;ref name="1UP: Posthumous p1" /&gt; and [[Digital Trends]] described the campaign as "bizarre" and "based around fart jokes".&lt;ref name="Digital Trends: Itoi teases"/&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' reported that they received more reader complaints about the game's scratch and sniff ad than about any other 1995 advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=When Ads Go Bad, Readers Get Mad|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=91|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1996|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was also expensive. It emphasized magazine advertisements and had the extra cost of the strategy guide included with each game.&lt;ref name="1UP: Vapor"/&gt; Aaron Linde of ''[[Shacknews]]'' wrote that the price of the packaged game curtailed sales.&lt;ref name="Shacknews: EarthBotched"/&gt; Between the poor sales and the phasing out of the Super NES, the game did not receive a European release.&lt;ref name="ONM review"/&gt;

The game originally received little critical praise from the American press,&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP: Vapor"/&gt; and sold poorly in the United States:&lt;ref name="IGN: top SNES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP: Vapor"/&gt; around 140,000 copies, as compared to twice as many in Japan.&lt;ref name="Shacknews: EarthBotched"/&gt; ''[[Kotaku]]'' described ''EarthBound''{{'s}} 1995 American release as "a dud" and blamed the low sales on "a bizarre marketing campaign" and graphics "cartoonish" beyond the average taste of players.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt; The game was released when RPGs were not popular in the United States,&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP: Posthumous p1" /&gt; and visual taste in RPGs was closer to ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''. The game was especially expensive due to the included [[strategy guide]].&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt; While the game piggybacked on Itoi's celebrity in Japan, it became a "curio" for European{{clarification needed|reason=The game wasn't released in Europe.|date=April 2018}} audiences.&lt;ref name="ONM review"/&gt;

Of the original reviewers, Nicholas Dean Des Barres of ''[[DieHard GameFan]]'' wrote that ''EarthBound'' was not as impressive as ''[[Final Fantasy VI|Final Fantasy III]]'', although just as fun.&lt;ref name="DHGF: Review"/&gt; He praised the game's humor&lt;ref name="DHGF: Viewpoint"/&gt; and wrote that the game completely defied his first impressions.&lt;ref name="DHGF: Review"/&gt; Des Barres wrote that "past the graphics", which were purposefully [[8-bit era|8-bit]] for nostalgia, the game is not an "entry level" or a "child's" RPG, but "highly intelligent" and "captivating".&lt;ref name="DHGF: Review"/&gt; The Brazilian ''Super GamePower'' explained that those expecting a ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]''-style RPG will be disappointed by the childish visuals, which were unlike other 16-bit games.&lt;ref name="SGP review"/&gt; They wrote that the American humor was too mature and that the gameplay was too immature, as if for beginners.&lt;ref name="SGP review"/&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' gave the game a mixed review, commenting that "[T]he lack of a convincing story line and the dull [[NES]]-clone graphics ... will make serious RPG fans a little cautious about approaching ''EarthBound''". They said the "saving graces are the fairly good music" and "hilarious adult humor" but added that "the humor is too mature for little kids, and the gameplay is too immature for older gamers."&lt;ref name="GPro72"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=EarthBound|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=72|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=July 1995|pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindblom and his team were devastated by the release's poor critical response and sales. He recalled that the game was hurt by reception of its graphics as "simplistic" at a time when critics placed high importance on graphics quality.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Lindblom thought reviewers viewed the game's visuals as "enhanced [[8-bit era|8-bit]] graphics", which, he added, would "ironically" fit 2013's [[retrogaming]] aesthetic.&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt;}} Lindblom felt that the game's changes to the RPG formula (e.g., the rolling HP meter and fleeing enemies) were ignored in the following years,&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Man Who Wrote"/&gt; though he thought the game had aged well at the time of its [[Virtual Console]] re-release in 2013.&lt;ref name="Wired: Lindblom"/&gt;

Reviewing the game years after its release, multiple writers described the game as "original" or "unique"&lt;ref name="ONM review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DHGF: Review"/&gt; and praised its script's range of emotions&lt;ref name="ONM review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; and humor.&lt;ref name="DHGF: Viewpoint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GPro72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SGP review"/&gt; IGN's Scott Thompson said the game teetered between solemn and audacious in its dialogue and gameplay, and noted its deviance from RPG tropes in aspects such as choice of attacks in battle.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; He found the game both "bizarre and memorable".&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]''{{'s}} Simon Parkin thought the game's script was its best asset, as "one of the medium's strongest and idiosyncratic storylines" that fluctuated "between humorous and poignant".&lt;ref name="ONM review"/&gt; ''GameZone''{{'s}} David Sanchez thought its script was "clever" and "sharp", as it displayed a wide range of emotions that made him want to talk to all non-player characters.&lt;ref name="GameZone review"/&gt; ''[[GamesTM]]'' wrote that the game designers spoke with their players through the non-playable characters, and noted how Itoi's interests shaped the script, its allusions to popular culture, and its "strangely existential narrative framework".&lt;ref name="GamesTM review"/&gt;

Critics praised its "[[reality|real world]]" setting, which was seen as an uncommon choice.&lt;ref name="ONM review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DHGF: Review"/&gt; IGN's Thompson noted its 1990s homage as "a love letter to 20th-century Americana", with a [[payphone]] as a [[save point]], [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] to transfer money, [[yo-yo]]s as weapons, skateboarders and hippies as enemies, and references to classic rock bands.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; ''Official Nintendo Magazine''{{'s}} Parkin noted the theme's distance from the "knights and dragons" common to the Japanese role-playing game genre.&lt;ref name="ONM review"/&gt; Reviewers noted the game's steep difficulty.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; IGN's Thompson wrote that the beginning was the hardest, and that aspects such as limited inventory, experience grinds, and monetary penalties upon death were unfriendly for players new to Japanese RPGs.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; He also cited the quick respawn time for foes and ultimate need not to avoid battles given the difficulty of bosses.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;

Reviewers described the game's ambiance as cheery and full of charm.&lt;ref name="GameZone review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; David Sanchez of ''GameZone'' thought the game's self-awareness added to its charm, where the player learned through the game's poking lighthearted fun.&lt;ref name="GameZone review"/&gt; He added that the music was an "absolute delight" and complimented its range from space sounds to themes to "bizarre" battle tracks that varied with the enemy type.&lt;ref name="GameZone review"/&gt; ''GamesTM'' wrote that the game's reputation comes from the "consistent ... visual language" in its [[Charles M. Schulz]]-esque character and world design.&lt;ref name="GamesTM review"/&gt; ''Kotaku''{{'s}} Jason Schreier found the ending unsatisfying and unrelieving, despite finding the ending credits with its character [[curtain call]] and photo album of "fuzzy pickles" moments all "wonderful".&lt;ref name="Kotaku: Trippiest"/&gt;

IGN's Scott Thompson wrote that ''EarthBound'' balances "dark Lovecraftian apocalypse and silly lightheartedness", and was just as interesting nearly a decade after its original release.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; While he lamented a lack of "visual feedback" in battle animations, he felt the game had innovations that still feel "smart and unique": the rolling HP meter and lack of random battles.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Thompson also noted that technical issues like animation slowdown with multiple enemies on-screen went unfixed in the rerelease.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; ''Official Nintendo Magazine''{{'s}} Parkin found the game to provide a more potent experience than developers with more resources and thought its battle sequences were "sleek".&lt;ref name="ONM review"/&gt; ''Nintendo World Report''{{'s}} Justin Baker was surprised by the "excellent" battle system and controls, which he found to be underreported in other reviews despite their streamlined, grind-reducing convenience.&lt;ref name="NWR review"/&gt; He wrote that some of the menu interactions were clunky.&lt;ref name="NWR review"/&gt; ''GamesTM'' felt that the game was "far from revolutionary", compared to ''Final Fantasy VI'' and ''Chrono Trigger'', and that its battle scenes were unexciting.&lt;ref name="GamesTM review"/&gt; The magazine compared the game's "chosen one" story to a "throwaway ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening|Link's Awakening]]''/''[[The Goonies|Goonies]]'' hybrid narrative".&lt;ref name="GamesTM review"/&gt; Reviewers praised Nintendo for digitizing the Player's Guide,&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; though IGN noted that it was technically easier to view it on another tablet rather than switching the Wii U's view mode.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Multiple reviewers concluded that the game had aged well.&lt;ref name="USgamer: the deal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameZone review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ONM review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NWR review"/&gt;

===Acclaim and influence===
''EarthBound'' was listed in ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]'', where Christian Donlan wrote that the game is "name-checked by the video gaming cognoscenti more often than it's actually been played". He called the game "utterly brilliant" and praised its overworld and battle system.{{r|1001 Must Play}} Similarly, ''Eurogamer''{{'s}} Simon Parkin described it as a "sacred cow amongst gaming's cognoscenti".{{r|Eurogamer: M3 review}} Critics consider ''EarthBound'' a "classic" or "must-play" video game,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/2013/07/earthbound-wii-u/&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|IGN review|Kotaku: Trippiest}} even in the United Kingdom, where the title was only available via import.{{r|GamesTM review}} Game journalists have ranked ''EarthBound'' among the best Super Nintendo games{{r|IGN: top SNES}} and most essential Japanese role-playing games,{{r|Gamasutra: essential}} and multiple reader polls ranked the game among the best of all time.{{r|Edge: Famitsu|IGN: top 2005|IGN: top 2006}} ''IGN'' rated ''EarthBound''{{'s}} setting among the best in the medium, indelible between its unconventional environments, 1960s music, and portrayal of Americanism.{{r|IGN: top worlds}} 

It has been described as one of the weirdest and most surreal role-playing games.{{r|Kotaku: Trippiest}} Examples include using items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues, experiencing in-game hallucinations, meeting "a man who turned himself into a dungeon", and battling piles of vomit,{{r|Kotaku: Trippiest}} [[taxi cabs]], and walking [[noose]]s.{{r|IGN: Retro Remix}} David Sanchez of ''GameZone'' wrote that ''EarthBound'' "went places no other game would" in the 1990s or even in the [[present day]], including "[[trolling]]" the player "before trolling was cool".{{r|GameZone review}} Localization reviewer Clyde Mandelin described the Japanese-to-English conversion as "top-notch for its time".{{r|Kotaku: Man Who Wrote}} ''Kotaku'' found the localization "funny, clever, and evocative",{{r|Kotaku: Man Who Wrote}} and ''1UP.com'' said it was "unusually excellent" for the time.{{r|1UP: Posthumous p1}} IGN wrote that Nintendo was "dead wrong" for believing that Americans would not be interested in "such a chaotic and satirical world".{{r|IGN: top worlds}}

''Kotaku'' described aspects of the game's story, such as the "Mr. Saturn coffee break", as "poignant".{{r|Kotaku: Man Who Wrote}} Jeremy Parish of ''[[USgamer]]'' called ''EarthBound'' "the all-time champion" of self-aware games that "warp ... perceptions and boundaries" and break the [[fourth wall]], citing its frequent internal commentary about the medium and the final scenes where the player is directly addressed by the game.{{r|USgamer: metatext}} He thought the final scene was "perhaps the most clever and powerful moment in a clever and powerful game".{{r|USgamer: metatext}} ''GamesTM'' said the game felt fresh because of its reliance on "personal experiences" made it "exactly the sort of title that would thrive today as an [[indie games|indie]] hit".{{r|GamesTM review}} He called this accomplishment "remarkable" and credited Nintendo's commitment to the "voices of creators".{{r|GamesTM review}} IGN's Nadia Oxford said that nearly two decades since the release, its final [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight against Giygas continues to be "one of the most epic video game standoffs of all time" and noted its emotional impact.{{r|IGN: 10 MMM}} ''Kotaku'' wrote that the game was content to make the player "feel lonely", and, overall, was special not for any individual aspect but for its method of using the video game medium to explore ideas impossible to explore in other media.{{r|Kotaku: Trippiest}}

''EarthBound'' is known for having a [[cult following]],{{refn|group=nb|Sources: {{r|IGN: top SNES}}{{r|IGN: top worlds}}{{r|Kotaku: Man Who Wrote}}{{r|IGN: Retro Remix}}{{r|1UP: Vapor}}{{r|The Verge: today}}}} which developed over time well after its release.{{r|Wired: Lindblom}} Colin Campbell of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' wrote that "few gaming communities are as passionate and active" as ''EarthBound''{{'s}},{{r|Polygon: Quash}} and ''[[1UP.com]]''{{'s}} Bob Mackey wrote that no game was as poised to have a cult following.{{r|1UP: Posthumous p1}} IGN's Lucas M. Thomas wrote in 2006 that ''EarthBound''{{'s}} "persistent", "ambitious", and "religiously dedicated collective of hardcore fans" would be among the first groups to influence Nintendo's decision-making through their purchasing power on Virtual Console.{{r|IGN: Retro Remix}} [[Digital Trends]]'s Anthony John Agnello wrote that "no video game fans have suffered as much as ''EarthBound'' fans", and cited Nintendo's reluctance to release ''Mother'' series games in North America.{{r|Digital Trends: Itoi teases}} IGN described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America for similar reasons.{{r|IGN: Retro Remix}} Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]] later credited the community response on their online [[Miiverse]] social platform as leading to ''EarthBound''{{'s}} eventual rerelease on their Virtual Console platform.{{r|Polygon: coming to VC}} Physical copies of ''EarthBound'' were hard to find before the rerelease,{{r|Kotaku: Trippiest}} and in 2013, were worth twice its initial retail price.{{r|Wired: Lindblom}}

''Wired'' described the amount of ''EarthBound'' "fan art, videos, and tributes on fan sites like ''EarthBound'' Central or [[Starmen.net]]" as mountainous.{{r|Wired: Lindblom}} Reid Young of Starmen.net and Fangamer credits ''EarthBound''{{'s}} popularity to its "labor of love" nature, with a "double-coat of thoughtfulness and care" across all aspects of the game by a development team that appeared to love their work.{{r|1UP: Posthumous p1}} Young started the [[fansite]] that would become Starmen.net in 1997 while in middle school. It became "the definitive fan community for ''EarthBound'' on the web" and had "almost inexplicable" growth.{{r|1UP: Posthumous p1}} ''Shacknews'' described the site's collection of fan-made media as "absolutely massive".{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} It also provided a place to aggregate information on the ''Mother'' series and to coordinate fan actions.{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}}

The ''EarthBound'' fan community at Starmen.net coalesced with the intent to have Nintendo of America acknowledge the ''Mother'' series.{{r|1UP: Posthumous p1}} The community drafted several thousand-person petitions for specific English-language ''Mother'' series releases,{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} but in time, their request shifted to no demand at all, wanting only their interest to be recognized by Nintendo.{{r|Ars Technica: epic}} A 2007 campaign for a ''Mother 3'' English localization led to the creation of a full-color, 270-page art book—''The EarthBound Anthology''—sent to Nintendo and press outlets as demonstration of consumer interest.{{r|1UP: Posthumous p2}} ''Shacknews'' called it more of a proposal than a collection of fan art, and "the greatest gaming love letter ever created".{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} Upon "little" response from Nintendo, [[Mother 3 fan translation|they decided to localize the game themselves]].{{r|1UP: Posthumous p2}} Starmen.net co-founder and professional game translator Clyde "Tomato" Mandelin led the project from its November 2006 announcement{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} to October 2008 finish.{{r|Kotaku: completed}} They then printed a "professional quality strategy guide" through [[Fangamer]], a video game merchandising site that spun off from Starmen.net.{{r|1UP: Posthumous p2}} ''[[The Verge]]'' cited the effort as proof of the fan base's dedication.{{r|The Verge: today}}

Other fan efforts include ''EarthBound, USA'', a full-length documentary on Starmen.net and the fan community,{{r|IGN: EB USA}} and ''Mother 4'', a fan-produced sequel to the ''Mother'' series that went into production when Itoi definitively "declared" that he was done with the series.{{r|Kotaku: M4 amazing}} After following the fan community from afar, Lindblom came out to fans in mid-2012 and the press became interested in his work. He had planned a book about the game's development, release, and fandom before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea. He plans to continue to communicate directly with the community about the game's history.{{r|Polygon: Quash}}{{refn|group=nb|For instance, Lindblom rejected a popular, or infamous, "abortion theory": that the game's final sequence is a metaphor for an abortion,{{r|Kotaku: Man Who Wrote}} with Giygas as the fetus.{{r|Kotaku: Trippiest}}}}

=== Ness ===

''EarthBound''{{'s}} Ness became widely known for his appearance as a playable character throughout the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Super Smash Bros.'' fighting game series]],{{r|IGN: top SNES}} debuting as a fighter in the [[Super Smash Bros. (video game)|first installment]] in 1999. {{r|IGN: SSB 3DS/Wii U}} Ness's inclusion in the original release was among its biggest surprises,{{r|IGN: Smash Profile}}{{refn|group=nb|Ness's original ''Super Smash Bros.'' spot was actually intended for ''Mother 3'' protagonist Lucas, but the developers later fit Ness into the character design{{r|Nintendo: SSB}} when ''Mother 3'' was delayed.{{r|IGN: evolution}}}} and renewed ''Mother'' series fans' faith in new content from Nintendo.{{r|IGN: Retro Remix}} Ness was one of the game's most powerful characters, according to ''IGN'', if players could perfect his odd controls and psychic powers.{{r|IGN: Smash Profile}} In Europe, which did not see an ''EarthBound'' release, Ness was better known for his role in the fighting game than for his original role in the role-playing game.{{r|ONM: drop Ness}}

Ness returned in the first sequel, ''Melee'', alongside an ''EarthBound''-themed item and [[Level (video gaming)|battle arena]].{{r|IGN: Smash Profile}}{{refn|group=nb|''Melee'' players toss [[Mr. Saturn]] items at enemies,{{r|IGN: Smash Profile}} and fight in an arena based on the ''EarthBound'' city of Fourside.{{r|IGN: Melee secrets}}}} Lucas, the protagonist of ''Mother 3,'' joined Ness in ''Brawl''.{{r|IGN: Smash final roster|IGN: Smash veterans}}{{refn|group=nb|''Brawl'' also contains the final level from ''Mother 3'' along with items and characters from the game,{{r|NWR: Brawl stages}} and a boss fight against ''Mother 3''{{'s}} antagonist, Porky.{{r|ONM: Porky}}}} Several years after ''Brawl''{{'s}} release, ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' wrote that Ness was an unpopular ''Smash'' character who should be removed from future installments.{{r|ONM: drop Ness}} However, Ness returned in [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]],{{r|USgamer: bid farewell}} and Lucas was later added as [[downloadable content]].{{r|Polygon: Lucas DLC}} Nintendo also produced Ness and Lucas [[Amiibo]] figurines.{{r|Polygon: Lucas DLC}}&lt;ref name="lucasamiibo"/&gt;

In 1996, Nintendo announced a sequel to ''EarthBound'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]: ''Mother 3''{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} (''EarthBound 64'' in North America).{{r|GameSpot: from the dead}}&lt;!--|IGN: Retro Remix--&gt; It was scheduled for release on the [[64DD]], a Nintendo 64 expansion peripheral that used a [[magneto-optical drive]],{{r|1UP: Vapor}} but struggled to find a firm release date{{r|IGN: M3 PUSHED}} as [[Development of Mother 3|its protracted development]] entered [[development hell]]. It was later canceled altogether in 2000{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} when the 64DD flopped.{{r|1UP: Vapor}} In April 2003, a Japanese television advertisement revealed that both ''Mother 3'' and a combined ''[[Mother 1+2]]'' cartridge were in development for the handheld [[Game Boy Advance]].{{r|GameSpot: sequels}} ''Mother 3'' abandoned the Nintendo 64 version's 3D, but kept its plot.{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} It became a bestseller upon its Japanese release in 2006, yet did not receive a North American release{{r|1UP: Vapor}} on the basis that it would not sell.{{r|Digital Trends: Itoi teases}} ''IGN'' described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America, as ''Mother 1'', ''Mother 1+2'' and ''Mother 3'' were not released outside Japan.{{r|IGN: Retro Remix}}

When Nintendo launched its digital distribution platform, Virtual Console, for the Wii in 2006, ''IGN'' expected ''EarthBound'' to be among Nintendo's highest priorities for rerelease, given the "religious" dedication of its fanbase.{{r|IGN: Retro Remix}} Though the game was ranked the most desired Virtual Console release by ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' readers, rated for release by the [[ESRB]],{{r|Nintendo Life: ESRB}} and able to be published with little effort,{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} the Wii version did not materialize.{{r|Polygon: Quash}} Many fans believed that music licensing or legal concerns impeded the rerelease.{{r|Kotaku: Man Who Wrote|Kotaku: not music|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} English localizer Marcus Lindblom doubted that the game's music samples were an issue, since they were not a concern during development, and instead hypothesized that Nintendo did not realize the magnitude of the game's popular support and did not consider it a priority project.{{r|Kotaku: Man Who Wrote}} By 2008, it was not apparent that Nintendo of America was considering a rerelease.{{r|Shacknews: EarthBotched}} At the end of 2012, Itoi announced that the rerelease was moving forward,{{r|Digital Trends: Itoi teases}} which a January 2013 [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation confirmed.{{r|Polygon: Wii U Japan}} 

As part of anniversary celebrations for the Nintendo Entertainment System and ''Mother 2'' in March 2013, Nintendo rereleased ''EarthBound'' for Japan on the Wii's successor, the Wii U Virtual Console.{{r|Polygon: Wii U Japan}} ''EarthBound'' producer Satoru Iwata, now Nintendo's president, soon announced a wider rerelease, citing fan interest on Nintendo's Miiverse social platform.{{r|Polygon: coming to VC}} The July 2013 American and European launch included a free, online recreation of the game's original Player's Guide, optimized for viewing on the [[Wii U Gamepad]].{{r|Polygon: now available}} The game was a top-seller on the Wii U Virtual Console, and both ''Kotaku'' users and first-time ''EarthBound'' players had an "overwhelmingly positive" response to the game.{{r|Kotaku: Man Who Wrote}} Simon Parkin wrote that its rerelease was a "momentous occasion" as the return of "one of Nintendo's few remaining lost classics" after 20 years.{{r|ONM review}} The rerelease was one ''GameSpot'' editor's game of the year,{{r|GameSpot: Justin Haywald}} and ''Nintendo Life''{{'s}} Virtual Console game of the year.{{r|Nintendo Life: GOTY 2013}} The [[New Nintendo 3DS]]-specific Virtual Console received the rerelease the next year, in March 2016.{{r|3DS}} In September 2017, Nintendo released the [[Super NES Classic Edition]], which included ''EarthBound'' among its games.&lt;ref name="supernesclassic"/&gt; Japan's version of the console did not include the game.&lt;ref name="chagrin"/&gt;{{clear}}

'''Equivocation''' (or the '''magician's choice''') is a verbal technique by which a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] gives an audience member an apparently free choice, but frames the next stage of the trick in such a way that each choice has the same end result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Philip|title=A treatise on the under-explored art of equivoque; techniques and applications|year=1976|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the performer may deal two cards to the table and ask a spectator to select one: if the spectator chooses the card on the left, the performer will say something like "you keep this card, I'll take the remaining card". If the spectator chooses the card on the right, the performer will take that card. Thus, the choice of which card to use is really made by the magician.

These basic techniques can be expanded to include practically any number of items, such as an entire deck of cards. For larger sets, items may first be grouped, then split up. The magician must quickly and carefully craft [[patter]] to convey the impression that the actions he or she takes with the items truly reflect the intent of the spectator.

==Card forcing==
{{main|Forcing (magic)}}
Equivocation can be used to [[Forcing (magic)|force a card]] without the use of [[sleight of hand]].  The use of this kind of verbal force in close-up [[magic (illusion)|magic]] apparently offers a subject a free or random [[choice]] of card. It is not as common as sleight of hand or other methods.

==Mentalism==
In another use, a mentalist may perform an apparent act of [[Mentalism|mind reading]] by using the "magician's choice" to force a particular envelope that relates to a needed outcome. A mentalist may also force an effect from a certain outcome, as in taking something ordinary and using it to show their magical prowess.

==Effectiveness==
In each of these examples, the effectiveness of the equivocation involves the "[[Info-gap decision theory|information gap]]" between what the spectator knows and what the spectator thinks they know. In the magician's force, the spectator does not know anything about what will happen to the two cards he initially selects. However, the spectator thinks that they are making a free choice in an otherwise scripted sequence of moves. In the effect of the prepared envelope, the spectator thinks they know that the envelope involves a prediction, but does not realize that the envelope in fact involves three predictions.

Equivocation tends to lose its effectiveness if repeated in the same context, since the spectator gains more information from one [[performance]] to the next, thereby shrinking the information gap. For example, a spectator may wonder why their choice was kept in some cases and discarded in others. Equivocation is a particular form of alternate ending forces where double entendre wording is used and a different pattern of results to questions can be noticed, but its real strength is best realized when augmented with artful psychological techniques.

[[File:Map-of-Oz.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the [[land of Oz]], the fictional realm that is the setting for [[L. Frank Baum]]'s "[[List of Oz books|Oz]]" series.]]
A '''fictional universe''' is a [[consistency|self-consistent]] [[setting (narrative)|setting]] with events, and often other elements, that differ from the real world. It may also be called an imagined, constructed or fictional realm (or world). Fictional universes may appear in [[novel]]s, [[comics]], [[film]]s, [[Television program|television shows]], [[video game]]s, and other creative works.

A fictional universe can be almost indistinguishable from the real world, except for the presence of the invented [[character (arts)|character]]s and events that characterize a work of fiction; at the other extreme, it can bear little or no resemblance to the real world, with invented fundamental principles of time and space.

The subject is most commonly addressed in reference to fictional universes that differ markedly from the real world, such as those that introduce entire fictional cities, countries, or even planets, or those that contradict commonly known facts about the world and its history, or those that feature fantasy or [[science fiction]] concepts such as [[Magic in fiction|magic]] or [[faster than light]] travel—and especially those in which the deliberate development of the setting is a substantial focus of the work.

==Definition==
What distinguishes a fictional universe from a simple setting is the level of detail and internal consistency. A fictional universe has an established continuity and internal logic that must be adhered to throughout the work and even across separate works. So, for instance, many books may be set in conflicting fictional versions of [[Victorian London]], but all the stories of [[Sherlock Holmes]] are set in ''the same'' Victorian London. However, the [[Adaptations of Sherlock Holmes|various film series based on Sherlock Holmes]]  follow their own separate continuities, thus not taking place in the same fictional universe.

The history and geography of a fictional universe are well defined, and maps and timelines are often included in works set within them. Even new [[fictional language|languages]] may be constructed. When subsequent works are written within the same universe, care is usually taken to ensure that established facts of the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] are not violated. Even if the fictional universe involves concepts such as elements of magic that don't exist in the real world, these must adhere to a set of rules established by the author.

A famous example of a detailed fictional universe is [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (more popularly known as [[Middle-earth]]), of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s books ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.  He created first its [[Languages of Arda|languages]] and then the world itself, which he states was "primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary 'history' for the Elvish tongues."&lt;ref&gt;Foreword to ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', by J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern example of a [[Fictional universe of Avatar|fictional universe]] is that of the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' film series, as [[James Cameron]] has invented an entire [[Pandoran biosphere|ecosystem]], with a team of scientists to test whether it was viable. Additionally, he commissioned a linguistics expert to invent the [[Na'vi language|''Na'vi'' language]].

Virtually every successful fictional [[TV series]] or [[comic book]] develops its own "universe" to keep track of the various episodes or issues. Writers for that series must follow the ''[[Bible (writing)|story bible]]'',&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000550.php How to Give Maris Hives, Alphabetized] (April 2008), a blog entry by scriptwriter [[Jane Espenson]]&lt;/ref&gt; which often becomes the series canon.

Frequently, when a series is perceived by its creators as too complicated or too self-inconsistent (because of, for example, too many writers), the producers or publishers may introduce [[retroactive continuity]] (retcon) to make future editions easier to write and more consistent. This creates an alternate universe that future authors can write about. These stories about the universe or universes that existed before the retcon are usually not canonical, unless the franchise-holder gives permission. ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' was an especially sweeping example.

Some writers choose to introduce elements or characters from one work into another, to present the idea that both works are set in the same universe. For example, the character of [[Ursula Buffay]] from American [[sitcom]] ''[[Mad About You]]'' was also a recurring guest star in ''[[Friends]]'', despite the two series having little else in common. Fellow NBC series ''[[Seinfeld]]'' also contained [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] references to ''Mad About You''. [[L. Frank Baum]] introduced the characters of [[Cap'n Bill]] and [[Trot (Oz)|Trot]] (from ''[[The Sea Fairies]]'') into the Oz series in ''[[The Scarecrow of Oz]]'', and they made a number of appearances in later Oz books. In science fiction, [[A. Bertram Chandler]] introduced into his future Galactic civilization the character [[Dominic Flandry]] from [[Poul Anderson]]'s quite different Galactic future (he had Anderson's consent) – on the assumption that these were two [[alternate history]] timelines and that people could on some occasions cross from one to the other.

==Scope==
[[Sir Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' is one of the earliest examples of a cohesive fictional world with its own rules and functional concepts, but it comprises only one small island. Later fictional universes, like [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Cimmerian]]'' stories or [[Lev Grossman]]'s [[Fillory]], are global in scope and some, like ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Honorverse]]'', ''[[BattleTech]]'', or the [[Lensman series]], are galactic or even intergalactic.

A fictional universe may even concern itself with more than one interconnected universe through fictional devices such as dreams, "[[time travel]]" or "parallel worlds". Such a series of interconnected universes is often called a [[parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]]. Such multiverses have been featured prominently in science fiction since at least the mid-20th century.

The classic ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]" introduced the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|Mirror Universe]], in which the crew members of the [[Starship Enterprise|Starship ''Enterprise'']] were brutal rather than compassionate. The 2009 movie ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' created an "alternate reality" and freed the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[media franchise|franchise]] from [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] issues. In the mid-1980s, [[DC Comics]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' streamlined its fictional continuity by destroying most of its alternate universes.

==Format==
A fictional universe can be contained in a single work, as in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' or [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', or in [[serial (literature)|serial]]ized, [[book series|series]]-based, open-ended or [[Round-robin story|round robin]]-style fiction.

In most small-scale fictional universes, general properties and [[timeline]] events fit into a consistently organized [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. However, in the case of universes that are rewritten or revised by different [[writer]]s, [[editing|editors]], or [[Film producers|producer]]s, this continuity may be violated, by accident or by design.

The occasional publishing use of retroactive continuity ([[retcon]]) often occurs due to this kind of revision or oversight. Members of [[fandom]] often create a kind of [[fan-made]] canon ([[canon (fiction)#Nature of fictional canons|fanon]]) to patch up such errors; "fanon" that becomes generally accepted sometimes becomes actual canon. Other fan-made additions to a universe ([[fan fiction]], [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]], [[pastiche]], [[parody]]) are usually not considered canonical unless they get [[authorization|authorized]].

==Collaboration==
{{see also|Shared universe}}

Shared universes often come about when a fictional universe achieves great commercial success and attracts other media. For example, a successful movie may catch the attention of various book authors, who wish to write stories based on that movie. Under U.S. law, the copyright-holder retains control of all other [[derivative work]]s, including those written by other authors, but they might not feel comfortable in those other mediums or may feel that other individuals will do a better job; therefore, they may open up the copyright on a shared-universe basis. The degree to which the copyright-holder or [[franchise (media)|franchise]] retains control is often one of the points in the [[license agreement#Intellectual property|license agreement]].

For example, the comic book ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' was so popular that it spawned over 30 different radio, television, and movie series and a similar number of [[video game]]s, as well as theme park rides, books, and songs. In the other direction, both ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'' are responsible for hundreds of books and games of varying levels of canonicity.

Fictional universes are sometimes shared by multiple prose authors, with each author's works in that universe being granted approximately equal canonical status. For example, [[Larry Niven]]'s fictional universe [[Known Space]] has an approximately 135-year period in which Niven allows other authors to write stories about the [[Man-Kzin Wars]]. Other fictional universes, like the [[Ring of Fire series|''Ring of Fire'' series]], actively court canonical [[The Grantville Gazettes|stimulus from fans]], but gate and control the  changes through a formalized process and the final say of [[Eric Flint|the editor and universe creator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =''[[Grantville Gazette III]]'' | others = [[Thomas Kidd (illustrator)|Thomas Kidd]] (cover art) | ISBN = 978-1-4165-0941-7 |id={{ISBN|1-4165-0941-0}} | publisher = [[Baen Books]] | last = [[Eric Flint|Flint, Eric]] and various others | pages = 311–313|quote=The print published and e-published Grantville Gazettes all contain a post book [[afterword]] detailing where and how to submit a manuscript to the fictional canon oversight process for the [[1632 series]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other universes are created by one or several authors but are intended to be used non-canonically by others, such as the fictional settings for [[game]]s, particularly [[role-playing game]]s and video games. Settings for the role-playing game ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' are called [[campaign setting]]s; other games have also incorporated this term on occasion. [[Virtual world]]s are fictional worlds in which [[online]] computer games, notably [[MMORPG]]s and [[MUD]]s, take place. A [[fictional crossover]] occurs when two or more [[fictional character]]s, series or universes cross over with one another, usually in the context of a character created by one author or owned by one [[company (law)|company]] meeting a character created or owned by another. In the case where two fictional universes covering entire ''actual'' universes cross over, physical travel from one universe to another may actually occur in the course of the story. Such crossovers are usually, but not always, considered non-canonical by their creators or by those in charge of the [[intellectual property|properties]] involved.

'''''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art''''', is a book written by [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] and originally published in 1990 by Jeremy Tarcher of the [[Penguin Group]].
 
Free Play is the creative activity of spontaneous free improvisation, by children, by artists, and people of all kinds.

According to Stephen Nachmanovitch, free play is more than improvisation.  It runs deeper than our activities involving music and art. It is the essence of our being, something we were born with then strive to recapture.

This book reflects the experience of an improvisational violinist as a doorway into understanding the acts of creation in which every human being engages in his or her daily life. Improvisation and creativity are not the property of a few professional artists or scientists but the essence of all our natural, spontaneous interactions. Every conversation is unrehearsed and reflects the activity of improvising as a basic life function.

From the opening of the first chapter:  "There is an old Sanskrit word, Lila (Leela), which means play. Richer than our word, it means divine play, the play of creation and destruction and re-creation, the folding and unfolding of the cosmos. Lila, free and deep, is both delight and enjoyment of this moment, and the play of God.  It also means love.
Lila may be the simplest thing there is---spontaneous, childish, disarming. But as we grow and experience the complexities of life, it may also be the most difficult and hard won achievement imaginable, and it's coming to fruition is a kind of homecoming to our true selves."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1416">A '''friction motor''' is a simple mechanism to propel [[toy cars]], trucks, trains, action figures and similar toys. The motor consists of a large [[flywheel]] which is connected to the drive wheels of the toy via a very low [[gear ratio]], so that the flywheel revolves faster. The flywheel's axis is perpendicular to the direction in which the toy faces and moves. When the toy is pushed forward, the drive wheels engage the flywheel. Pushing the vehicle forward repeatedly spins this flywheel up to speed. When let go, the flywheel drives the vehicle forward. The flywheel stores the kinetic energy of the initial acceleration and propels the toy after it is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=5360367|title=Toy car structure}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the flywheel, unlike the spring of a [[pullback motor]], is continuously rotating and not held, the motor may be "pumped up" by pushing the car repeatedly forward. The cars also typically work in forward and reverse. Some used a ''zip cord'' pulled from the vehicle body to accelerate the flywheel directly. Another system was the ''Turbo Tower of Power'' (TTP) in which air expelled from a hand-operated pump pushed turbine blades on the flywheel's rim.

These toys were especially popular in the 1960s to 1980s though they continue to be available today.

'''Hip-hop dance''' refers to [[street dance]] styles primarily performed to [[hip-hop music]] or that have evolved as part of [[hip hop|hip-hop culture]]. It includes a wide range of styles primarily [[Breakdancing|breaking]]  which was created in the 1970s and made popular by [[dance crew]]s in the United States. The television show ''[[Soul Train]]'' and the 1980s films ''[[Breakin']]'', ''[[Beat Street]]'', and ''[[Wild Style]]'' showcased these crews and dance styles in their early stages; therefore, giving hip-hop mainstream exposure. The dance industry responded with a commercial, studio-based version of hip-hop—sometimes called "new style"—and a hip-hop influenced style of jazz dance called "jazz-funk". Classically trained dancers developed these studio styles in order to choreograph from the hip-hop dances that were performed on the street. Because of this development, hip-hop dance is practiced in both dance studios and outdoor spaces.

The commercialization of hip-hop dance continued into the 1990s and 2000s with the production of several television shows and movies such as ''[[The Grind (TV series)|The Grind]]'', ''[[Planet B-Boy]]'', ''[[Rize (film)|Rize]]'', ''[[StreetDance 3D]]'', ''[[America's Best Dance Crew]]'', ''[[Saigon Electric]]'', the ''[[Step Up (film series)|Step Up]]'' film series, and ''[[The LXD]]'', a web series. Though the dance is established in entertainment, including mild representation in theater, it maintains a strong presence in urban neighborhoods which has led to the creation of street dance derivatives [[Gangsta walking|Memphis jookin]], [[turfing]], [[jerkin']], and [[krump]].

1980s films, television shows, and the Internet have contributed to introducing hip-hop dance outside the United States. Since being exposed, educational opportunities and dance competitions have helped maintain its presence worldwide. Europe hosts several international hip-hop competitions such as the UK B-Boy Championships, Juste Debout, and EuroBattle. Australia hosts a team-based competition called World Supremacy Battlegrounds and Japan hosts a two-on-two competition called World Dance Colosseum.

What distinguishes hip-hop from other forms of dance is that it is often "freestyle" (improvisational) in nature and hip-hop dance crews often engage in freestyle dance competitions—colloquially referred to as "battles". Crews, freestyling, and battles are identifiers of this style. Hip-hop dance can be a form of entertainment or a hobby. It can also be a way to stay active in competitive dance and a way to make a living by dancing professionally.

==History==
{{Main|History of hip-hop dance}}
Hip-hop dance is a broad category that includes a variety of styles. It originated at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue by DJ Kool Herc and his historic block party that started it all. The older dance styles that were created in the 1970s include uprock, breaking, and the funk styles.&lt;ref name=graffiti&gt;{{cite web|title=Physical Graffiti...

He says that the song "Get on the Good Foot" inspired crowds to imitate the singer's dance moves. |accessdate=September 8, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uZwX237j?url=http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/breakdancing/ |archivedate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2005 |publisher=Record Research |location=Menomonee Falls |page=85 |isbn=0898201608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking at this period was not primarily floor-oriented as seen today; it started out as [[toprock]] which dancers perform while standing up. An influence on toprock was [[uprock]]&lt;ref&gt;Chang 2006, p. 20. "Toprockin's structure and form fuse dance forms and influences from uprocking, tap, lindy hop, James Brown's "good foot," salsa, Afro-Cuban, and various African and Native American dances."&lt;/ref&gt; which was created in [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Schloss 2009, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang 2005, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Uprock looks similar to toprock, but it is more aggressive and looks like a fight. Uprock is also performed with partners, but in toprock—and in breaking in general—each person takes turns dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Chang 2006, p. 21. "The structure was different from b-boying/b-girling since dancers in b-boy/b-girl battles took turns dancing, while uprocking was done with partners."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, [[DJ Kool Herc]] invented the break beat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Icons of hip hop: an encyclopedia of the movement, music, and culture |volume=1 |editor-last=Hess |editor-first=Mickey |page=xxi |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=2007 |isbn=0313339031 |quote=Jamaican American DJ Kool Herc creates the beak beat by isolating the most exciting instrumental break in a record and looping that section so that the break played continuously.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=break&gt;Chang 2006, p. 19. "DJ Kool Herc, originally from Jamaica, is credited with extending these breaks by using two turntables, a mixer and two of the same records. As DJs could re-cue these beats from one turntable to the other, finally, the dancers were able to enjoy more than just a few seconds of a break! Kool Herc also coined the terms 'b-boy' and 'b-girl' which stood for 'break boys' and 'break girls.' At one of Kool Herc's jams, he might have addressed the dancers just before playing the break beats by saying, 'B-Boys are you ready?! B-Girls are you ready?!' The tension started to mount and the air was thick with anticipation. The b-boys and b-girls knew this was their time to 'go off!'."&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Break (music)#Break beat|break beat]] is a rhythmic, musical interlude of a song that has been looped over and over again to extend that instrumental solo. Kool Herc did this to provide a means for dancers who attended his parties to demonstrate their skills.&lt;ref name=break/&gt; B-boy and b-girl stands for "break-boy" and "break-girl"; b-boys and b-girls dance to the break of a record.&lt;ref name=break/&gt; Further influenced by [[martial arts]]&lt;ref&gt;Chang 2006, p. 20. "Early influences on b-boying and b-girling also included martial arts films from the 1970s."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gymnastics]], breaking went from being a purely upright dance style—toprock only—to becoming more floor-oriented.

At the same time breaking was developing in New York, other styles were being created in California. The ''funk styles'' refers to several [[street dance]] styles created in California in the 1970s such as roboting, bopping, hitting, locking, bustin', popping, electric boogaloo, strutting, sac-ing, and dime-stopping.&lt;ref name="cipher"/&gt; Out of all of these dances, boogaloo is one of the oldest. It started out as a 1960s fad dance and was the subject of several songs released during that time such as "Do the Boogaloo" and "My Baby Likes to Boogaloo". From being a fad, it developed into a dance style called electric boogaloo and a music genre called [[Latin boogaloo]]. The most popular and widely practiced of the funk styles are locking and popping.&lt;ref name=urban&gt;{{cite news|last=Garofoli |first=Wendy |title=Urban Legend |magazine=Dance Spirit |date=April 1, 2008 |accessdate=October 27, 2009 |url=http://www.dancespirit.com/urban-legend-2326035185.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5q4R2fdWc?url=http://www.dancespirit.com/articles/1755 |archivedate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television show ''Soul Train'' played a large role in giving these styles commercial exposure. Both [[The Lockers]] and [[The Electric Boogaloos]]—dance crews responsible for the spread of locking and popping—performed on this show.&lt;ref name="funky"&gt;{{cite news|last=Freeman |first=Santiago |title=Planet Funk |magazine=Dance Spirit |date=September 20, 2010 |url=http://www.dancespirit.com/planet-funk-2326048646.html |accessdate=November 23, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5q4R2fdWC?url=http://www.dancespirit.com/articles/2177 |archivedate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is historically inaccurate to say that the funk styles were always considered hip-hop.&lt;ref name=village&gt;{{cite news|last=Seibert |first=Brian |title=Breaking Down |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2004-10-26/news/breaking-down/ |work=[[Village Voice]] |date=October 26, 2004 |accessdate=December 5, 2012 |quote=Although much hip-hop history is murky and contested, the legendary status of these men is clear. It's the hip-hop label that's questionable. Campbell grew up in Los Angeles. Solomon started out in Fresno, and later moved to L.A. "One thing that came out of the conferences," says Harris, "is that the West Coast faction said they were not part of hip-hop. They got swallowed up by hip-hop"—an East Coast term and movement— "when they had never heard of it." Their moves pre-dated hip-hop, at least in its popularized form, and they prefer the term "funk styles." This concern with definitions and labels is partly a belated response to the international "breakdancing" fad of the early '80s, when the mainstream media and Hollywood latched onto a variety of regional and individual styles, collapsing them into a single trend. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Cga1jacK?url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2004-10-26/news/breaking-down/ |archivedate=December 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Vox Media|Racked]]'' Moncell Durden, assistant dance professor at the [[University of Southern California]], is quoted as saying "Hip-hop dance involves two dances: breaking and social dances. That's it. Nothing else is hip-hop."&lt;ref name=racked&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.racked.com/2016/10/25/13351708/hip-hop-international-world-dance-championship|title=Dance, Dance Revolution|last=Grob Plante|first=Stephie|date=October 25, 2016|work=Racked.com|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=April 15, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331074107/https://www.racked.com/2016/10/25/13351708/hip-hop-international-world-dance-championship|archivedate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funk styles were adopted into hip-hop in large part due to the media.&lt;ref name=village/&gt; The media identified these styles as "breakdance" which caused confusion about their origin.&lt;ref&gt;Rivera 2003, p. 72. "With the barrage of media attention it received, even terminology started changing. 'Breakdancing' became the catch-all term to describe what originally had been referred to as 'burning', 'going off', 'breaking', 'b-boying', and 'b-girling.' Dance styles that originated in the West Coast such as popping and locking were also grouped under the term 'breakdance.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang 2006, pp. 18–19. "Although dance forms associate with hip-hop did develop in New York City, half of them (that is, popping and locking) were created on the West Coast as part of a different cultural movement. Much of the media coverage in the 1980s grouped these dance forms together with New York's native dance forms (b-boying/b-girling and uprocking) labeling them all "breakdancing". As a result, the West Coast "funk" culture and movement were overlooked..."&lt;/ref&gt; They were created on the west coast independent from breaking and were originally danced to [[funk music]], rather than hip-hop music.&lt;ref name="funky"/&gt;&lt;ref name=village/&gt;

As breaking, locking, and popping gained popularity in the 1980's, hip-hop social dancing (party dancing) started to develop. [[Novelty and fad dances]] such as the [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit#The Roger Rabbit dance|Roger Rabbit]], the Cabbage Patch, and the [[The worm (dance move)|Worm]] appeared in the 1980s followed by the [[The Humpty Dance|Humpty]] dance and the [[The Running Man (dance)|Running Man]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Pagett 2008, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The Running Man has African origins. It was performed at the [[Fela Kuti]] concert "Cross Examination" in Berlin in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |year=1978 |title=Fela Kuti – Cross Examination |medium=concert performance |location=Berlin, Germany |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMGWx6DjMkU |time=09:20 |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} The music of the day was the driving force in the development of these dances. For example, the 1980s rap group [[Gucci Crew II]] had a song called "The Cabbage Patch" that the dance of the same name was based on.&lt;ref&gt;Pagett 2008, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; 2000s era social dances include the [[Cha Cha Slide]], the [[Cat Daddy]], and the [[Dougie]]. The previously mentioned dances are a sample of the many that have appeared since hip-hop developed into a distinct dance style. Like hip-hop music, hip-hop social dancing continues to change as new songs are released and new dances are created to accompany them.

That didn't come into play until more Puerto Ricans got involved in the mid 70s. We then took the dance, evolved it and kept it alive. In '79 I was getting dissed.

Traditionally, breakers dance within a ''cypher'' or an ''Apache Line''.

===Locking===
{{Main|Locking (dance)|l1=Locking}}
Locking, originally called Campbellocking, was created in 1969 in Los Angeles, California by [[Don Campbell (dancer)|Don "Campbellock" Campbell]] and popularized by his crew [[The Lockers]].&lt;ref name=urban/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guzman-Sanchez 2012, pp. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Campbell, the original members of The Lockers were Fred "Mr. Penguin" Berry, Leo "Fluky Luke" Williamson, Adolfo "Shabba-Doo" Quiñones, Bill "Slim the Robot" Williams, Greg "Campbellock Jr" Pope, and [[Toni Basil]], who also served as the group's manager.&lt;ref name="Guzman-Sanchez 2012, p. 41"&gt;Guzman-Sanchez 2012, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelockersdance.com/ |work=TheLockersDance.com |title=The Lockers |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=train&gt;{{cite podcast|host=Neil Conan |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123532527 |title=How 'Soul Train' Got America Dancing |date=February 9, 2010 |publisher=Talk of the Nation from [[NPR]] News |website=NPR.org |accessdate=November 28, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63CSharBp?url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123532527 |archivedate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 [[World Hip Hop Dance Championships]], Basil became the first female recipient of the Living Legend Award in honor of her role in giving locking commercial exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Agpawa |first=Marirose |title=Just dance: Vegas hosts international competitions |newspaper=The Rebel Yell |date=August 10, 2009 |url=http://www.hiphopinternational.com/living-legend/ |accessdate=August 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locking looks similar to popping, and the two are frequently confused by the casual observer. In locking, dancers hold their positions longer. The ''lock'' is the primary move used in locking. It is "similar to a freeze or a sudden pause."&lt;ref name="Chang 2006, p.22"&gt;Chang 2006, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; A locker's dancing is characterized by frequently ''locking'' in place and after a brief freeze moving again.&lt;ref name=urban/&gt; According to ''Dance Spirit'' magazine, a dancer cannot perform both locking and popping simultaneously; thus, it is incorrect to call locking "pop-locking".&lt;ref name=urban/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang 2006, p. 23. "Dancers in Los Angeles also distorted the name by calling it "pop-locking", while in France it was called "The Smurf".&lt;/ref&gt; While both styles originate in Los Angeles, locking and popping are two distinct funk styles with their own histories, their own set of dance moves, their own pioneers, and their own competition categories. Locking is more playful and character-driven, whereas popping is more illusory.&lt;ref name=urban/&gt; In popping, dancers push the boundaries of what they can do with their bodies.&lt;ref name=urban/&gt; Locking has specific dance moves that distinguish it from popping and other funk styles. In the 2006 book ''Total Chaos'', hip-hop historian Jorge "Popmaster Fabel" Pabon lists some of these moves which include "the lock, points, skeeter [rabbits], scooby doos, stop 'n go, which-away, and the fancies."&lt;ref name="Chang 2006, p.22"/&gt; In addition, Lockers commonly use a distinctive dress style, such as colorful clothing with stripes and [[suspenders]].&lt;ref name=urban/&gt;

===Popping===
{{Main|Popping}}
Popping was created in [[Fresno, California]] in the 1970s and popularized by Samuel "Boogaloo Sam" Solomon and his crew the [[Electric Boogaloos]].&lt;ref name=urban/&gt; It is based on the technique of quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk in a dancer's body, referred to as a ''pop'' or a ''hit''. When performed correctly, each ''hit'' is synchronized to the rhythm and beats of the music. Popping is also used as an umbrella term to refer to a wide range of closely related illusionary dance styles&lt;ref name=pop&gt;Chang 2006, p. 23. "Sam's creation, popping, also became known as the unauthorized umbrella title to various forms within the dance. past and present. Some of these forms include Boogaloo, strut, dime stop, wave, tick, twisto-flex, and slides."&lt;/ref&gt; such as strobing, [[Liquid and digits|liquid]], animation, twisto-flex, and waving.&lt;ref name="funky"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; Dancers often integrate these styles with standard popping to create a more varied performance.{{#tag:ref|Two regional substyles that developed out of popping are [[gangsta walking|jookin']] (also called ''buckin'')&lt;ref name="funky"/&gt; from [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and [[turfing]] from Oakland, California. Turfing borrows heavily from gliding.&lt;ref name=turf/&gt;|group="note"}} In all of these subgenres it appears to the spectator that the body is popping. The difference between each subgenre is how exaggerated the popping is. In liquid, the body movements look like water. The popping is so smooth that the movements do not look like popping at all; they look fluid.&lt;ref name="funky"/&gt; The opposite of this is strobing (also called ticking) in which the movements are staccato and jerky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Croft |first=Clare |title=Hip-Hop's Dynamic New Stage |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37403-2005Apr8.html |date=April 10, 2005 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=October 11, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206095354/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37403-2005Apr8.html |archivedate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popping as an umbrella term also includes gliding.&lt;ref name="funky"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; Gliding is a lower body dance performed with little to no movements in the chest or arms. In gliding a dancer appears as if they are drifting across the floor on ice.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]], called the backslide in popping context, is an example of sliding.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposite from gliding is tutting, an upper body dance that uses the arms, hands, and wrists to form right angles and create geometric box-like shapes. Tutting can be done primarily with the fingers rather than the arms. This method is called finger tutting. In both variations the movements are intricate, linear, and form 90° or 45° angles. In practice, tutting looks like the characters on the [[art of ancient Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hunt |editor2-last=Ramon |editor1-first=Darnell |editor2-first=Ana-Christina |title=Black Los Angeles: American Dreams and Racial Realities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mk7A7bdaELsC&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=121 |year=2010 |publisher=NYU Press |location=New York City |isbn=081473734X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dancestudiolife.com/2012/07/2-tips-for-hip-hop-teachers-tutting-and-toning/|date=July 1, 2012|title=2 Tips for Hip-Hop Teachers – Tutting and Toning|last=Hubela|first=Geo|work=Dance Studio Life|accessdate=February 7, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130408013815/http://www.dancestudiolife.com/2012/07/2-tips-for-hip-hop-teachers-tutting-and-toning/|archive-date=April 8, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jookin/&gt;{{Rp|2}} hence the name—a reference to [[King Tut]].

While popping as an umbrella term is widely used by hip-hop dancers and in competitive hip-hop dancing, [[Popin Pete|Timothy "Popin' Pete" Solomon]] of the Electric Boogaloos disagrees with the use of the word "popping" in this way. Many of these related styles (animation, liquid, tutting, etc.) can not be traced to one person or group. Solomon states "There are people who wave and there are people who tut. They're not popping. I say this to give the people who created other styles their just dues and their [[wikt:props|props]]."&lt;ref name=urban/&gt;

==Derivative street styles==
{{Main|Gangsta Walking|l1=Memphis Jookin'|Turfing|Jerkin'|Krumping}}
Decades after breaking, locking, and popping became established, four new dance styles appeared. Three of them come from California and one comes from Tennessee. Memphis Jookin' was created in the 1980s in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. It is an evolution of an older Memphis line dance called The Gangsta' Walk.&lt;ref name=jookin&gt;{{cite web |last=Davis |first=Chris |date=June 2013 |work=Memphis Magazine |title=Jookin – Is it the New Ballet? |url=http://www.memphismagazine.com/June-2013/Jookin-Is-it-the-New-Ballet/index.php?cparticle=1&amp;siarticle=0#artanc |accessdate=February 8, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906230525/http://www.memphismagazine.com/June-2013/Jookin-Is-it-the-New-Ballet/ |archivedate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Macaulay |first=Alastair |date=April 3, 2013 |title=Hip-Hop Meets Ballet in One Man's Body |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/arts/dance/lil-buck-at-le-poisson-rouge.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=February 9, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220115854/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/arts/dance/lil-buck-at-le-poisson-rouge.html |archivedate=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dance Magazine|''Dance'' magazine]], jookin is characterized by dancers "gliding footwork... popping and waving... [and] using the tips of their sneakers to balance on [[pointe]]."&lt;ref name=jook&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/August-2013/Mesmerizing-Moves|title=Mesmerizing Moves|last=Harss|first=Marina|date=August 2014|work=Dance|accessdate=September 28, 2013 |quote=Jookin' is an integral part of the African-American culture of the city. Developed in Memphis in the 1980s, jookin'—and other related forms like the gangsta walk, buckin', and choppin'—is a localized derivation of hip-hop dance. Memphis hip-hop has a particular sound, with rat-a-tat-rhythms, and a bit of a soul-funk lilt. "A little southern-ness and a basement-like quality, a homemade feel," is how [Charles "[[Lil Buck]]" Riley] describes it. The dance originated as a kind of walking step with a strong rhythmic bounce punctuated by staccato lifting of the knees, like walking on hot coals. As it evolved, the gliding footwork was added, as well as the popping and waving, and, finally, the icing on the cake: Dancers started using the tips of their sneakers to balance on pointe. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002140053/http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/August-2013/Mesmerizing-Moves |archivedate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gliding on tiptoes is fundamental to this dance. While watching a jookin' battle in [[Jackson, Tennessee]], dance critic [[Alastair Macaulay]] observed that "the most evidently sensational feature of jookin is the extensive use of what a ballet observer is bound to call pointwork: the men, in sneakers, go onto tiptoe... many of the men not only rose onto point but also hopped, turned, ran and balanced on point."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Macaulay |first=Alastair |date=November 2, 2012 |title=On Point, in Their Jeans and Sneakers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/arts/dance/lil-buck-a-jook-star-from-memphis.html?_r=1&amp; |work=The New York Times |accessdate=February 7, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104084624/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/arts/dance/lil-buck-a-jook-star-from-memphis.html |archivedate=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jookers have traditionally practiced their moves at the Crystal Palace skating rink in Memphis, which is [[wikt:akin|akin]] to how [[milonguero]]s practice their moves in public spaces in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name=jook/&gt;

===Commercial/New Style===
{{See also|Tabitha and Napoleon D'umo#Lyrical hip-hop|l1=Lyrical hip-hop}}
The dance industry responded to hip-hop dance by creating a commercial version of it known as urban choreography. This urban choreography, sometimes called "new style", is the kind of hip-hop dance seen in rap, R&amp;B, and pop music videos and concerts. From the point of view of someone deeply immersed in hip-hop culture, anything that looks like hip-hop dance that did not come from the streets and is not improvisational in nature is not a true hip-hop dance form. In an interview with ''Dance'' magazine, choreographer and hip-hop dance teacher Emilio "Buddha Stretch" Austin, Jr. described his point-of-view:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{cquote|There are a lot of jazz dancers out there doing pseudo hip hop. A lot of teachers don't know the history, they're just teaching the steps. They're learning from videos, but they don't know the culture. If all you see is Britney Spears, you think that's hip hop, but that's never been hip hop. It's completely watered down. And studios could [sic] care less, because hip hop is one of their biggest moneymakers.&lt;ref name=studio&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wisner |first=Heather |title=From Street to Studio |journal=Dance |year=2006 |pages=74–76 |volume=80 |issue=9 |issn=0011-6009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Stage performance can suppress improvisation which defined hip-hop dance early in its development.&lt;ref name=graffiti/&gt;&lt;ref name=studio/&gt;&lt;ref name=jacob&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker |first=Janine |title=Hip-hop dance party at Jacob's Pillow |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=August 8, 2009 |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2009/08/08/hip_hop_dance_party_at_jacobs_pillow/ |accessdate=August 15, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206094722/http://archive.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2009/08/08/hip_hop_dance_party_at_jacobs_pillow/ |archivedate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, meshing different dance styles together dissolves their structures and identities.&lt;ref name=graffiti/&gt; In an interview with ''The Bronx Journal'', choreographer and artistic director Safi Thomas expressed a similar qualm as Austin concerning hip-hop instruction within the studio:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{cquote|In a lot of studios what you find is people just doing movement to hip-hop music. So if there's hip-hop music in the background, and they're moving, they're calling it a hip-hop class. The problem with that is let's say I wanted to teach a ballet class and I just come in, and I throw on [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and I just start moving—and I'm not doing any of the foundational elements. I am not doing any of the movement vocabulary of ballet. I can not call that a ballet class and that's what happens in relation to hip-hop... within the studio realm there is no standard for the art form, and [the teachers] don't know what the foundational elements of the art are.

The term "new style" was created by dancers outside the United States. According to Moncell Durden, adjunct professor at [[Drexel University]] and director of the film ''History and Concept of Hip-Hop Dance'', the 1992 dance documentary ''Wreckin' Shop From Brooklyn'' was very influential to hip-hop dancers in France and Japan.&lt;ref name=moncell&gt;{{cite av media |people=Durden, Moncell (Director) |year=2009 |title=History and Concept of Hip-Hop Dance |medium=DVD |publisher=DLex Productions/Dancetime Publications |time=31:44 |quote=The reason the term new style came about was because of a documentary in 1992 called ''Wreckin' Shop'' that heavily influenced dancers in Japan and in France. Amazingly enough these two groups of dancers from two different countries began to shorten this term and say 'we want to dance like the New York dancers... we're going to do the New Style, meaning New York Style—dancing like the kids dance in New York. And that's where that came from.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dancers wanted to move like the New York hip-hop dancers who were profiled in the documentary. They called the social dancing (party dancing) they saw "new style" which was short for "New York Style".&lt;ref name=moncell/&gt;

In the context of the commercial dance industry, urban choreography (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others.&lt;ref name=hiphopballet&gt;{{cite web|last=Werbrouck|first=Debbie|date=December 8, 2010|title=From Fad to Foundation|url=http://www.dancestudiolife.com/2010/12/from-fad-to-foundation/|work=Dance Studio Life|accessdate=January 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214062532/http://www.dancestudiolife.com/2010/12/from-fad-to-foundation/|archive-date=December 14, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crash&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wisner |first=Heather |date=October 2007 |title=Crash Course: Hip Hop |journal=Dance |volume=81 |issue=10 |pages=82–85 |issn=0011-6009 |quote=Despite their differences, the styles are connected by the music, plus a low-slung center of gravity that comes from African dance roots, and some shared basic steps. Many steps don't have specific names; in class, teachers might speak generally of jumps and turns or use imagery to evoke how a step-should look. Hip hop training relies less on specific exercises than on strength training, flexibility, and learning to isolate and move body parts independently from the rest of the body... A good way to approach freestyling, Sparks says, is to pick out a single element in the music—the horns, a snare drum—and use that as a movement guide... Focusing on the music helps you know what accents to hit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|82}} 

{{quote box|align=left|width=250px|bgcolor=#C6DBF7|quote="I would say that Toni Basil was sort of our [[Abe Saperstein]] in terms of how she was able to organize us into a professional dance troupe. I remember her teaching us how to count music. She was like, okay, we were like, count music? How do you count soul? It was crazy, you know?... all of our cues kind of went something like this, boom, pop, do boom, pada da boom, pada like that. And she was like, how do you guys get in sync like that? I said it's a feeling, you know?" |source=Adolfo "Shabba-Doo" Quiñones;&lt;br/&gt;The Lockers&lt;ref name=train/&gt;}} A significant [[wikt:juncture|juncture]] in the development of hip-hop was the addition of eight-counts, a method of counting dance steps to stay in sync with the music. [[Toni Basil]] introduced this studio technique into locking in the 1970s. Basil was trained in ballet before being introduced to street dance by Don Campbell, the creator of locking and founding member of [[The Lockers]] dance crew.&lt;ref name=urban/&gt; She is responsible for teaching the rest of The Lockers how to dance to counts. Traditionally hip-hop dance, or any form of [[street dance]], is not performed to counts as these styles were created on the street rather than in a studio setting. Therefore, the introduction of counts was a pivotal move into bringing hip-hop dance from the street into the studio. Even with this addition, it would be years before commercial hip-hop developed into its current form.

A second important event in the development of hip-hop was the start of hip-hop dance instruction. Buddha Stretch was a pioneer in this field. He started teaching formal hip-hop dance classes in 1989 at [[Broadway Dance Center]] in New York City where he continues to teach today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Buddha Stretch Faculty Bio |url=http://www.broadwaydancecenter.com/faculty/bios/stretch_buddha.shtml |work=BroadwayDanceCenter.com |accessdate=August 13, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622174924/http://www.broadwaydancecenter.com/faculty/bios/stretch_buddha.shtml |archivedate=June 22, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, hip-hop party dancing started to appear in music videos and on television—this was another important point in the development and commercialization of hip-hop. An early example of this is when Janet Jackson performed the Running Man in her 1989 music video for the song "[[Rhythm Nation]]" which was choreographed by street dancer Anthony Thomas.&lt;ref name=anthony&gt;{{cite book|first1=Stephanie|last1=Jordan|first2=Dave|last2=Allen |title=Parallel Lines: Media Representations of Dance|publisher=John Libbey Publishing|location=London|year=1993|page=68 |isbn=9780861963713 |quote=Through her choice of Anthony Thomas, a black American street dancer, as her choreographer, Janet Jackson secures a threefold achievement: she satisfies the dictates of commercial pop music industry by creating a dance image which is significantly different from her earlier work; she demonstrates that, despite fame, she is still in touch with contemporary youth pop culture and its fashions; and finally, she utilizes, not the dance traditions of the Hollywood musical which, although often black in inspiration, remained very much under the control of white choreographers, but the work of a black young man whose training is outside the institutions of Western theatre and clearly an Afro-American cultural expression of the late 1980s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance was so popular during this time it was also performed by 1990s rappers [[MC Hammer]] and [[Vanilla Ice]] in their choreographed routines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson |first=Regina |title=Throwback: The Running Man |url=http://www.essence.com/2010/02/02/throwback-the-running-man/ |work=Essence |date=February 2, 2012 |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69tZtkEWJ?url=http://www.essence.com/2010/02/02/throwback-the-running-man/ |archivedate=August 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Jackson also used hip-hop in his 1992 music video "[[Remember The Time]]" which was choreographed by a then 21-year-old [[Fatima Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fatima Robinson—director, choreographer |url=http://stylelikeu.com/closets/fatima-robinson/ |work=StyleLikeU.com |accessdate=June 25, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706015701/http://stylelikeu.com/closets/fatima-robinson/ |archivedate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Robinson was a street dancer with no formal training and "Remember the Time" was her first music video job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bloom |first=Julie |date=November 26, 2006 |title=Supreme Commander |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/arts/dance/26bloo.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=May 31, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202090451/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/arts/dance/26bloo.html |archivedate=December 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to MTV.com, "Dances have always been a part of hip-hop culture — from the running man to the Soulja Boy dance..."&lt;ref name=newwest/&gt; and this era was the start of commercial hip-hop choreography as it looks today: dance routines are not specific to one genre (strictly popping, strictly locking, or strictly breaking) but rather an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of urban party dancing with studio technique added to it.

===Jazz-funk===
Another style the dance industry created in response to hip-hop was ''jazz-funk''. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called ''[[In Living Color]]''.&lt;ref name=flygirls&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|title=Color Them Funny: TV's New Black Comedy Hit|journal=New York Magazine|date=October 8, 1990|volume=23|issue=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7VasQrBnm8C&amp;pg=PA28|page=35|issn=0028-7369|quote=Opening and closing the show are the Fly Girls, dancers clothed in brilliant colors who erupt on stage to a strong, sexy beat and who dance a blend of hip hop and jazz.

She's got what's goin' on!'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by [[Rosie Perez]].&lt;ref name=flygirls/&gt; Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and [[jazz dance]].&lt;ref name="funky"/&gt; R&amp;B singer [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]] uses this style.&lt;ref name="funky"/&gt; Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style.&lt;ref name=prepix/&gt; They have choreographed for [[K-pop]] singers [[Jay Park]] and [[G.NA]] as well as for K-pop boy bands [[2PM]] and [[Beast (South Korean band)|B2ST]].&lt;ref name=prepix&gt;{{cite web|title=Dancing Away with Prepix |url=http://seoulbeats.com/2012/05/dancing-away-with-prepix/ |work=SeoulBeats.com |date=May 3, 2012 |accessdate=June 25, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69QRlzDIZ?url=http://seoulbeats.com/2012/05/dancing-away-with-prepix/ |archivedate=July 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in [[lyrical hip-hop]]—there are no [[Glossary of ballet#Pirouette|pirouettes]] or [[Arabesque (ballet position)|arabesques]] and dancers do not perform on [[Glossary of ballet#Relevé|relevé]] (on the balls of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.&lt;ref name="funky"/&gt;

===Business developments===
Other developments in the dance industry occurred in response to the growing popularity of hip-hop. On the traveling convention circuit there were tap, ballet, and jazz dance conventions, but there were none specifically for hip-hop. The same void existed in dancewear. There was dancewear for tap, ballet, and jazz dancers but none for hip-hop dancers. Monsters of Hip Hop and Nappytabs dancewear were formed to answer to both needs. Nappytabs is the first line of hip-hop dancewear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krisanits |first=Tracy |date=March 2007 |title=Keeping Tabs |journal=Dance Retailer News |volume= |issue=5 |page=46 |issn=1541-0307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because their clothing is made for hip-hop dancers, they do not sell [[leotard]]s, [[unitard]]s, tights, or [[leg warmer]]s. Their line consists of tank tops, shorts, t-shirts, sweat pants, [[harem pants]], and [[hoodie]]s. Monsters of Hip Hop (MOHH) was founded in 2003 in Baltimore, Maryland by Andy Funk, Becky Funk, and Angie Servant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us |url=http://www.monstersofhiphop.com/about/ |work=MonstersofHipHop.com |accessdate=August 1, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5q4R2fdbv?url=http://www.monstersofhiphop.com/about/ |archivedate=May 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention is dedicated exclusively to hip-hop instruction.&lt;ref name=funkmonster&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dancestudiolife.com/2007/09/how-funk-created-a-monster/|title=How Funk Created a Monster|last=Wisner|first=Heather|date=September 1, 2007|work=Dance Studio Life|accessdate=January 22, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130120055112/http://www.dancestudiolife.com/2007/09/how-funk-created-a-monster/|archive-date=January 20, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fatima Robinson]], Stefan "[[Mr. Wiggles]]" Clemente, and Timothy "Popin' Pete" Solomon have taught classes at MOHH in the past.&lt;ref name=funkmonster/&gt; Every year, the convention brings together its top student dancers for a professionally choreographed showcase in Los Angeles called ''Monsters of Hip Hop: The Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Monsters of Hip Hop: The Show Hits Los Angeles; Directed by Tabitha and Napoleon Dumo!|publisher=PRLog|date=August 4, 2008|url=http://www.prlog.org/10098936-monsters-of-hip-hop-the-show-hits-los-angeles-directed-by-tabitha-and-napoleon-dumo.html|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOHH may have been the first hip-hop dance convention, but it is not the only one that exists. Urban Dance Camp (UDC) is a six-week-long German-based dance convention held every year in [[Lörrach]], a small town on the border of France and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbandance.eu/camp/ |title=Urban Dance Camp|work=UrbanDance.eu|accessdate=January 30, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312110201/http://www.urbandance.eu/camp/ |archivedate=March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report on the event by a local paper, Bettina Kraft, the manager of UDC, estimated that 85% of the participants were from outside Germany. In 2009 Kraft created Urban Dance Showcase, a parallel event to UDC reserved only for performances by professional choreographers, dance crews, and UDC teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/loerrach/loerrach-der-nabel-der-urbanen-tanzwelt--18584092.html |title=Lörrach der Nabel der urbanen Tanzwelt |last=Ruda |first=Barbara |date=August 21, 2009 |work=Badische Zzeitung |accessdate=January 30, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6E3if6r59?url=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/loerrach/loerrach-der-nabel-der-urbanen-tanzwelt--18584092.html |archivedate=January 30, 2013 |language=de |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancers such as [[Shaun Evaristo]], [[Les Twins]], [[I.aM.mE]], [[b-boy Lilou]], and b-boy [[Hong 10]] have performed at the showcase in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbandance.eu/show/artists/|title=Artists &amp; Crews 2012|work=UrbanDance.eu|accessdate=January 30, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208024641/http://www.urbandance.eu/show/artists/|archivedate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from dancewear and conventions, developments in agency representation occurred as well. Although limited, representation for individual dancers had existed since the 1980s at the beginning of the music video era due to the pioneering work of talent agent [[Julie McDonald (agent)|Julie McDonald]].{{#tag:ref|Representation for dance ''groups'' existed before the music video era.

==Entertainment==

===Movies===
The entertainment industry has been largely responsible for introducing hip-hop dance to mainstream audiences around the world. The first hip-hop films ''[[Wild Style]]'', ''[[Beat Street]]'', and ''[[Breakin']]'' were made in the 1980s. When ''Wild Style'' opened in Japan, Rock Steady Crew performed breaking in Tokyo's [[Harajuku]] shopping district to promote the film.&lt;ref&gt;Chang 2005, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wild Style'' was the first movie centered around hip-hop culture; however, ''[[Flashdance]]'' was the first commercially released film to feature breaking.&lt;ref name=flash&gt;Kugelberg 2007, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|''Wild Style'' was produced in New York City and independently released.&lt;ref name=flash/&gt;|group="note"}} In 1984, ''[[Beat Street]]'' was released in [[West Germany]] and screened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] which helped to introduce breaking, graffiti writing, and [[turntablism]] to this part of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1297/year/1984.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Beat Street |accessdate=December 6, 2012 |work=Festival-Cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elflein |first=Dietmar |date=October 1998 |title=From Krauts with Attitudes to Turks with Attitudes: Some Aspects of Hip-Hop History in Germany |journal=Popular Music |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=255–265 |doi=10.1017/S0261143000008539}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Breakin''' and ''[[Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo]]'' brought the funk styles to the cinema.

Several hip-hop dance films were produced after the millennium. ''The Freshest Kids: A History of the B-Boy'', ''[[Neukölln Unlimited]]'', ''B-Girl'', ''[[Bouncing Cats]]'', ''[[Planet B-Boy]]'', and ''[[Battle of the Year: The Dream Team]]'' all showcase breaking. Films such as ''[[Honey (2003 film)|Honey]]'', ''[[Save the Last Dance]]'', ''[[You Got Served]]'', the ''[[Step Up (film series)|Step Up]]'' film series, ''[[StreetDance 3D]]'', ''Hype Nation'', ''[[Saigon Electric]]'', ''Berlin Dance Battle 3D'', and ''[[ABCD: Any Body Can Dance]]'' showcase all forms of hip-hop dance, especially new style hip-hop. ''[[Rize]]'', ''The Heart of Krump'', and ''Shake City 101'' are documentaries about [[krumping]]. All of these movies and documentaries are examples of films where the plot and theme surround hip-hop dance and how it affects the characters' lives. ''Bouncing Cats'' is the story of b-boy Abraham "Abramz" Tekya who uses b-boying to empower youth in Uganda.

===Television===
Before reaching movie audiences, hip-hop dance was already being broadcast on television.

Each dancer in line would take their turn dancing down the middle.

Other music variety shows on television at this time were ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'', and ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. Unlike ''Soul Train'' which focused on soul and funk, these shows promoted [[Top 40]] music and pop acts. ''Solid Gold'' employed a permanent dance troupe called the Solid Gold Dancers who performed choreographed routines to musical performances. [[Lucinda Dickey]], an actress and dancer who played the lead role in the ''Breakin' '' films, appeared on the show during the 1982–1983 season as a Solid Gold dancer. In 1983, street dancers Marc "Mr. Freeze" Lemberger from [[Rock Steady Crew]], Timothy "Popin' Pete" Solomon and Dane "Robot Dane" Parker from the Electric Boogaloos, and locking dancers Alpha "Omega" Anderson and Lewis "Deputy" Green also appeared on Solid Gold during a performance to the song "[[Flashdance...

Several hip-hop dance shows premiered in the 2000s including (but not limited to) ''[[Dance Fever (2003 TV series)|Dance Fever]]'', ''[[Dance 360]]'', ''[[Wade Robson|The Wade Robson Project]]'', ''MTV Dance Crew'', ''[[America's Best Dance Crew]]'', ''[[Dance on Sunset]]'', and ''[[Shake It Up (U.S. TV series)|Shake It Up]]''. In 2006, MTV France documented the creation of a dance crew for an original series called ''MTV Dance Crew''.&lt;ref name=mtv&gt;{{cite av media |people=Devaud, Sebastien (Director) |year=2006 |title=MTV Dance Crew |medium=DVD |language=French |publisher=2good Productions / MTV Networks |location=France }}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers were able to see the crew from auditions to the selection of the final eight who were subsequently named Original Soul. Original Soul was coached by three professional choreographers who mentored them and helped refine their dancing. Over the course of 32 episodes they routinely participated in professional dance battles including the popping battle at [[Juste Debout]], the Seven 2 Smoke battle at [[The Notorious IBE]], and b-boy battles at [[Chelles, Seine-et-Marne|Chelles]] Battle Pro.&lt;ref name=mtv/&gt; [[B-boy Lilou]], b-boy crew Phase T, and [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] Bruce Ykanji (the founder of Juste Debout) all made appearances during the show.&lt;ref name=mtv/&gt;

ABDC contributed to the exposure of several crews such as [[Jabbawockeez]], [[Quest Crew|Quest]], [[Beat Freaks]], and [[Poreotics]]. These crews now have official websites, work with musical artists, and perform at live events. The JabbaWockeeZ had a show in Las Vegas, Nevada called ''MÜS.I.C.'' at the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino.&lt;ref name=muse/&gt; ''MÜS.I.C.'' was the first hip-hop dance stage show on the Las Vegas Strip.&lt;ref name=muse&gt;{{cite news|last=Palopoli |first=Steve |date=April 21, 2011 |title=Fingerz on the Pulse |url=http://www.metroactive.com/features/the-bangerzs.html |work=Metro Active |accessdate=August 12, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/628sB4CV1?url=http://www.metroactive.com/features/the-bangerzs.html |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Jabbawockeez performed the show during a five-month residency at the Jupiters Hotel and Casino in [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Browne |first=Sally |title=US dance sensation Jabbawokeez to land at Jupiters |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/life/whatson/us-dance-sensation-to-land-on-jupiters/story-fn8zvh1s-1226326724554 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |date=April 15, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67qUE6JVT?url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/life/whatson/us-dance-sensation-to-land-on-jupiters/story-fn8zvh1s-1226326724554 |archivedate=May 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Poreotics and Hokuto "Hok" Konishi from Quest were nominated for a [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards|2011 MTV Video Music Award]] for Best Choreography.&lt;ref name=nom&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 MTV VMA Nominees For Best Choreography Are |url=http://www.dancetrackmagazine.com/?p=5503 |work=Dance Track |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/628sIRGNq?url=http://www.dancetrackmagazine.com/?p=5503 |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poreotics was nominated with singer [[Bruno Mars]] for his video "[[The Lazy Song]]".

In contrast to ABDC, individual dancers from all backgrounds compete on the reality dance competition ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (United States)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'' (SYTYCD). It has a similar premise to the ''[[Idol series|Idol]]'' series of singing competitions with initial auditions leading to the selection of a winner over the course of several episodes. In 2008, poppers Robert "Mr. Fantastic" Muraine and Phillip "Pacman" Chbeeb auditioned during season four of the US series. Neither made it to the final "Top 20", but the judges were so impressed with their dancing that both were invited back to participate in a popping battle against each other on the show's live finale.

Though hip-hop dancing is established on film and on television, it has not gained the same level of exposure in theater. This may be due to the fact that the dance is performed more in film and in television than it is in a theatrical setting.&lt;ref&gt;Chang 2006, p. 24. "As relatively new dance forms, b-boying/b-girling, uprocking, locking, and popping are rarely seen in a theatrical setting. They are usually performed in music videos, commercials, or films..."&lt;/ref&gt; B-boy and popper Stefan "[[Mr. Wiggles]]" Clemente and hip-hop historian Jorge "Popmaster Fabel" Pabon were involved in hip-hop theater at its inception.

In 2004, Safi Thomas founded the [[Hip-Hop Dance Conservatory]] (HHDC) in New York City.&lt;ref name=standard/&gt; Thomas' goal was to provide a comprehensive education to hip-hop dancers that was comparable to what ballet, modern, and jazz dancers experience at their respective institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography |url=http://www.hdcny.com/staff.html |work=HDCNY.com |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204025518/http://www.hdcny.com/staff.html |archive-date=February 4, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; HHDC provides a formal curriculum with dance classes (breaking, freestyle, locking, etc.) and academic classes (dance theory, physiology, kinesiology, etc.) to people who want to pursue hip-hop dance as a career.&lt;ref name=standard/&gt;&lt;ref name=bronxnet&gt;{{cite av media |people=Daren Jaime (host) Safi Thomas, Yvonne Chow (artistic director and education director of the Hip-Hop Dance Conservatory) |date=April 27, 2011 |title=Hip Hop Dance Conservatory Repertory Company.mov |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsR2HDd1bZU&amp;lr=1 |medium=Television production |accessdate=October 8, 2011 |publisher=BronxnetOPEN |location=Bronx, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only educational institution in the United States that is exclusively dedicated to hip-hop dance instruction.&lt;ref name=bronxnet/&gt; HHDC does not grant degrees. It is a non-profit organization and repertory company that grants certifications to dancers that complete the three-year program.&lt;ref name=standard/&gt;

Three years later in 2007, the [[University of East London]]'s Center for Performing Arts Development (CPAD) started intake for the only bachelor's degree program in the world specializing in hip-hop, urban, and global dance forms.&lt;ref name=cpad&gt;{{cite web|title=BA (Hons) Dance: Urban Practice |url=https://www.uel.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/ba-hons-dance-urban-practice |work=UEL.ac.uk |accessdate=August 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5q4R2fdYa?url=http://www.uel.ac.uk/ipad/programmes/index.htm |archivedate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPAD's program also lasts three years, but it is not exclusive to hip-hop. Students also study African dance, [[kathak]], [[Bollywood#Bollywood song and dance|Bollywood]], and [[capoeira]].

[[Image:Iz toy.png|thumb|128px|right|The green/orange iZ]]

The '''Zizzle iZ''' is an electronic musical toy released in September 2005 from [[Zizzle]]. Taking the shape of an abstract tripod figure, the iZ allows users to interactively manipulate music by twisting particular parts of the figure's body as well as add sound effects to prerecorded sound from a connected audio device. The toy also acts as a dancing speaker.

Since its release it has been available in three color schemes, green/orange, dark blue/light blue and red/yellow.

iZ was developed by [[Roger Shiffman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Happy Tune for Zizzle's iZ?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2005-08-22/a-happy-tune-for-zizzles-iz|publisher=www.bloomberg.com|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also created the [[Giga Pets]], [[Furby]] and [[Poo-Chi]] toys. It was explicitly said during the development phase that a "new [[Furby]]" was the aim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Cole | first=Wendy | title=Toyland's Saviour? | date=August 7, 2005 | publisher=Time | url=http://www.time.com/time/insidebiz/article/0,9171,1090894,00.html | accessdate = October 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; iZ is designed to seem like it has a life of its own and does things out of its user's control when there is interaction with it.

==Modes of operation==
Since the iZ is such an abstract kind of toy the easiest way to understand it is by learning what you can do with it.

The iZ has a few methods for input. First, as mentioned, it has an audio jack to connect other audio devices. It has two ears that are twistable and a [[touch-sensitive]] [[tentacle]], called a flicker, on its head. On top of this it also has five buttons placed on different places on its colorful belly. All the input methods except the audio jack are colored in a secondary color to raise its [[affordance]]. The iZ's three legs are also adjustable, but these do not generate any input.

For output the iZ has a built in speaker, a nose that lights up in different colors and two eyes driven by small motors making them able to move up and down.

When another audio device is connected to the iZ it acts as a speaker but also overlays some of its own sound effects on top of the sound from the audio device. When overlaying its own sound effects it also moves its eyes and lights up its nose. By pressing the left side of iZ belly the sound effects will be turned off and iZ will only act as a regular speaker.

When no other audio device is connected iZ has three modes of operation; Play, DJ and WZIZ FM.

In Play mode, which is the startup mode, iZ lets you compose your own music by manipulating his inputs. Each ear corresponds to one audio track, the belly controls the drum track and tempo, and the flicker can be hit for iZ to generate sound effects. iZ randomly adds his own flavour to the track by overlaying witty comments or radio noise.

When in DJ mode iZ evolves the track himself by changing one feature of the track at a time. If the user doesn't like the current music iZ outputs, the belly can be pressed to force iZ to instantly make a change. No interaction is allowed in this mode, so when the user tries any input which will change the track a simple sound is played to indicate that it registered the input but won't react to it.

As stated in iZ's manual "Although he is not a radio, he thinks he is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iZ Operating Instructions |publisher=Zizzle |url=http://www.zizzle.com/images/iZmanual.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2006-10-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526081325/http://zizzle.com/images/iZmanual.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In WZIZ FM mode, iZ creates a completely new track every time it makes a change and inserts a noise to simulate the tuning of radio stations between the tracks. If you adjust the ears, which are supposed to be the antenna, you make iZ create a new random track instantly.

==iZ Cartoon==
Zizzle and [[DIC Entertainment]] created a [[direct-to-video]] iZ cartoon, ''iZ and the Zizzles'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iZ and the Zizzles|url=http://www.toonarific.com/show.php?show_id=8426|publisher=www.toonarific.com|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iZ and The Zizzles|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27044/iz-and-the-zizzles/|publisher=www.dvdtalk.com|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer could be viewed on the Zizzle website.

'''Irrational Games, LLC''' (known as '''2K Boston, LLC''' between 2007 and 2009) was an American [[video game developer]] founded in 1997 by three former employees of [[Looking Glass Studios]]: [[Ken Levine (video game designer)|Ken Levine]], Jonathan Chey, and Robert Fermier. The studio was acquired by [[Take-Two Interactive]] in 2006. The studio was known for its games ''[[System Shock 2]]'', ''[[Freedom Force (2002 video game)|Freedom Force]]'', ''[[SWAT 4]]'', and most notably two of the games in the ''[[BioShock (series)|BioShock]]'' series. In 2014, following the release of ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'', Levine opted to significantly restructure the studio from around 90 to 15 employees and focus more on narrative games. In February 2017, the studio announced that it had been rebranded as [[Ghost Story Games]] and considered a fresh start from the original Irrational name, though still operating at the same business subsidiary under Take-Two.

* 2010 – 2K Boston announces its return to its original name, "Irrational Games" on January 8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/01/08/the-return-of-irrational-games.aspx The Return Of Irrational Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after ''BioShock'' was released, rumors arose that many of the staff who had worked on the game were leaving 2K Boston/Australia. In 2007, five members of the 2K Boston team moved to a new 2K Games studio in [[Novato, California]].&lt;ref name=levineinterview&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6206477.html |title=Q&amp;A: Ken Levine talks BioShock, reminisces about X-Com |accessdate=April 9, 2009 |date=March 20, 2009 |publisher=GameSpot |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628230158/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6206477.html |archivedate=June 28, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, 2K Games announced the formation of [[2K Marin]] in Novato.&lt;ref name=2kmarin&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6184063.html | title=Take-Two confirms 2K Marin |accessdate=April 9, 2009|date=December 17, 2007|publisher=GameSpot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July 2010, several media outlets reported that a recently created [[website]], whatisicarus.com, was a promotion relating to Irrational Games' unannounced project. The following week, information about the game was again teased, with the trailer confirmed for release on August 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Totilo|first=Stephen|title=BioShock Creators’ Next Game Debuts Next Week, Trailer On Aug. 12|url=http://kotaku.com/5602577/bioshock-creators-next-game-debuts-next-week-trailer-on-aug-12|publisher=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was eventually revealed to be ''[[BioShock Infinite]]''.

Before Irrational started development on ''BioShock Infinite'', the studio did preliminary work for the ''XCOM'' project that later became ''[[The Bureau: XCOM Declassified]]''.&lt;ref name="polygon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/3/6/5474722/why-did-irrational-close-bioshock-infinite|title=The final years of Irrational Games, according to those who were there|last=Plante|first=Chris|date=March 6, 2014|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restructuring and rebranding ===
{{Main article|Ghost Story Games}}

On February 18, 2014, Levine announced that the vast majority of the Irrational Games studio staff would be laid off, with all but fifteen members of the staff losing their positions. Levine said that he wanted to start a "a smaller, more entrepreneurial endeavor at Take-Two", speaking to how much stress completing a large game like ''BioShock: Infinite'' had caused him.&lt;ref name="gamespot shutdown"/&gt; Levine said "I need to refocus my energy on a smaller team with a flatter structure and a more direct relationship with gamers. In many ways, it will be a return to how we started: a small team making games for the core gaming audience."&lt;ref name="gamespot shutdown"/&gt; Levine had considered starting a new development studio for this, knowing that building the ideas would take several years before any game product would be made, but Take-Two offered to let him keep the division within Take-Two, with Levine saying that they told him "there was no better place to pursue this new chapter than within their walls".&lt;ref name="gamespot shutdown"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-creator-irrational-games-is-shutting-down/1100-6417821/ | title = BioShock creator Irrational Games is shutting down | first= Eddie | last = Makuch | date = February 18, 2014 | accessdate = February 23, 2017 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio helped to find positions for the displaced employees, and 2K Games hosted a career day for the remaining 75 employees to help seek employment at 57 other studios.&lt;ref name="gamespot shutdown"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/28/5458470/irrational-games-closure-layoffs-75-job-fair-57-studios |title=Irrational Games closure led to 75 layoffs, job fair hosted 57 studios |date=February 28, 2014|accessdate=April 15, 2014 |publisher=Polygon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levine and the 15 remaining members of the team began the process of creating new, smaller games focusing on a replayable narrative for the core gamers. It was said that Levine's studio will continue to keep the Irrational name, although Take-Two later stated that it was not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-05-14-take-two-ceo-open-to-buying-more-studios | title = Take-Two CEO open to buying more studios | first = Chris | last = Morris | date = May 14, 2014 | accessdate = May 14, 2014 | publisher = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through 2014 to 2015 Irrational Games continued to post several openings for jobs at the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Emily |last=Gera |url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/11/24/7274539/bioshock-developer-irrational-games-is-hiring-again |title=BioShock developer Irrational Games is hiring again |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=November 24, 2014 |accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Dave |last=Tach |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/6/8558865/irrational-games-hiring-senior-programmer |title=BioShock creator Irrational Games continues to hire for its mystery project |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=May 6, 2015 |accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Allegra |last=Frank |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/12/11/9891652/irrational-games-new-game-fps-steam-bioshock |title=Irrational Games hiring for 'narrative first-person shooter' project |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=December 11, 2015 |accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, Levine and the remaining staff are currently developing their first game which will be a "first-person sci-fi" game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-28-ken-levine-teases-new-first-person-sci-fi-project | title = BioShock creator Ken Levine teases new first-person sci-fi project | first = Tom | last = Phillips | date = January 28, 2015 | accessdate = May 28, 2015 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2017, the studio announced it had rebranded itself as Ghost Story Games, founded by 12 of the former Irrational members with Levine still as president and creative director.&lt;ref name="gamespot ghoststory"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bioshock-studio-irrational-games-adopts-a-n/1100-6448166/ | title = Former BioShock Studio Irrational Games Adopts A New Name | first = Chris | last= Pereira |date = February 23, 2017 | accessdate = February 23, 2017 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio's focus is "to create immersive, story-driven games for people who love games that ask something of them";&lt;ref name="gamespot ghoststory"/&gt; the name was chosen as [[ghost story|ghost stories]] "are immersive, exciting, and steeped in community", similar to their design philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/23/14717902/irrational-games-changes-name-ghost-story-games | title = Irrational is now called Ghost Story Games | first = Charlie | last = Hall | date = February 23, 2017 | accessdate = February 23, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of this point, the studio had about 25 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/irrational-games-is-gonesay-hello-to-ghost-story/ | title = Irrational Games is gone—say hello to Ghost Story | first= Andy | last = Chalk | date = February 23, 2017 | accessdate = February 23, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Keyhole''''' was a black-and-white [[alternative comics|alternative]] [[comic book]] published from 1996–1998. A two-man [[anthology]] by cartoonists [[Dean Haspiel]] and [[Josh Neufeld]], ''Keyhole'' was published by two different publishers, starting with [[Millennium Publications]] and ending up at [[Top Shelf Productions]].

== Publication history ==
''Keyhole'' began as a self-published [[mini-comic]] by the long-time friends Haspiel and Neufeld.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;Gilbert, Scott. "''Keyhole'' #5," ''The Comics Journal'' #210 (Jan. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Keyhole Mini-Comics'' ran for four issues in 1995. Reviewed in ''[[Factsheet Five]]'', ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'', and elsewhere, it was then picked up by Millennium,&lt;ref&gt;Bogad, Larry. [http://joshcomix.home.mindspring.com/press/interviews/larry_bogad.htm "A Peek at ''Keyhole''" (Haspiel/Neufeld interview), JoshComix.com (1996).] Accessed Feb. 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  which published the first full-sized issue in June 1996. With its fourth issue, ''Keyhole'' was released under Millennium's new imprint, [[Millennium Publications|Modern Comics]]. Top Shelf picked up the comic for its fifth and sixth issues.

In 2002, Haspiel, Neufeld, and [[Alternative Comics (publisher)|Alternative Comics]] announced plans to publish ''Keyhole'' vol. II,&lt;ref&gt;Yarbrough, Beau. [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=1285 "Talent Deserving of Wider Recognition: Dean Haspiel of ''Opposable Thumbs''," Comic Book Resources (July 23, 2002).] Accessed Feb. 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; but the comic never appeared, and the two cartoonists have since moved on to other projects.

== Form and content ==
Equally inspired by [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/yt/sfc/ms.html Neufeld, quoted in "Professional Quotables: M-S," Shadowfish Comics (1999).] Accessed Feb. 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Los Bros Hernandez]]' ''[[Love and Rockets (comics)|Love and Rockets]]'', a typical issue of ''Keyhole'' featured an autobiographical travel story by Neufeld, a [[Billy Dogma]] story by Haspiel, and short recurring features such as [[Rob Walker (journalist)|R. Walker]] and Neufeld's "Titans of Finance," Neufeld's one-page "Travel Tips," and the Haspiel/Neufeld collaborative feature "Lionel's Lament." Other stories appearing in ''Keyhole'' included short autobiographical pieces by Haspiel, and assorted collaborations with other writers (including one memorable piece with ''The Duplex Planet'''s [[David Greenberger]]).

== Legacy ==
Although ''Keyhole'' only ran six issues, it was a critically acclaimed project which proved to be a launching pad for both Haspiel and Neufeld's careers. ''The Comics Journal'' characterized ''Keyhole'' this way: "Brought together in a single, independent magazine, these artists' strong, disparate talents create a broad reading experience, and a blending of artistic intentions and personal expression like very few others available today in American comix."&lt;ref name="Gilbert" /&gt;

Haspiel debuted his existential antihero, Billy Dogma, in ''Keyhole'', a character whose adventures have since been published by Modern Comics, Top Shelf, [[Alternative Comics (publisher)|Alternative Comics]], and [[Image Comics]]. In addition, Haspiel collected many of the autobiographical stories from ''Keyhole'' in ''Opposable Thumbs'' (2001), published by Alternative Comics, and used those stories as a jumping-off point for the ''Street Code'' stories he later told on [[DC Comics]]' [[webcomics]] imprint [[Zuda Comics]].

Neufeld, in turn, collected the "Titans of Finance" stories in a self-titled comic published by Alternative in 2001. In 2004, he collected his ''Keyhole'' travel stories (as well as subsequent ones) in the [[Xeric Award]]-winning graphic novel ''A Few Perfect Hours''.

In addition, both cartoonists became regular illustrators for Harvey Pekar and his ''American Splendor'' projects.

The '''LA to the Moon Tour''' is the fourth headlining concert tour by American singer [[Lana Del Rey]], in support of her fifth studio album and fourth major-label studio album, [[Lust for Life (Lana Del Rey album)|''Lust for Life'']] (2017). The tour began on January 5, 2018, at the [[Target Center]] in [[Minneapolis]],&lt;ref name="RollingStone"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|title=Lana Del Rey Sets 2018 LA to the Moon Tour|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lana-del-rey-sets-2018-la-to-the-moon-tour-w505833|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=September 27, 2017|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortiz|first=Edwinl|title=Lana Del Rey Announces L.A. to the Moon Tour With Special Guests Jhené Aiko and Kali Uchis|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2017/09/lana-del-rey-la-to-the-moon-tour|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=September 27, 2017|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and visited cities across North America, South America, Oceania and Europe.&lt;ref name="Tour" /&gt;

== Background ==
Del Rey's fifth studio album, ''[[Lust for Life (Lana Del Rey album)|Lust for Life]]'' was officially released worldwide on July 21, 2017. During the months leading up to the album's release, fans and press speculated whether or not Del Rey would embark on a headlining concert tour in support of the album, as she did not for her previous release, ''[[Honeymoon (Lana Del Rey album)|Honeymoon]]''. In an interview for [[Beats 1]] on July 12, 2017, [[Zane Lowe]] asked Del Rey if she planned to go on a world tour and she seemed unsure,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/post/idsa.2f404d00-672a-11e7-92c9-80667257793b|date=2017-07-12|title=Listen to 'The Lana Del Rey Interview' posted by Zane Lowe|website=[[Apple Music]]|language=en|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but during the following months Del Rey began to announce various one-off promotional concerts across the United Kingdom and United States. The promotional tour took place from July to October 2017, and consisted of concerts at intimate venues in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trendell|first=Andrew|title=Lana Del Rey announces a rare UK show at Brixton Academy|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/lana-del-rey-uk-tour-show-brixton-academy-tickets-2017-2112646|work=[[NME]]|date=July 18, 2017|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; cities in [[California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/2017/07/26/lana-del-rey-announces-intimate-house-of-blues-shows-in-anaheim-and-san-diego-next-week/|title=Lana Del Rey announces intimate House of Blues shows in Anaheim, San Diego next week|date=2017-07-26|work=[[Orange County Register]]|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Demaria|first=Richie|title=Lana Del Rey's Sweet Sadness|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2017/sep/13/lana-del-reys-sweet-sadness/|work=[[Santa Barbara Independent]]|date=September 13, 2017|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carmancia|first=Jon|title=Review: Lana Del Rey, a Character No More|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/arts/music/lana-del-rey-lust-for-life-live-review.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 6, 2017|accessdate=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/08/10/lana-del-rey-new-york-city-shows-terminal-5|title=Lana Del Rey Announces New York City Shows|date=2017-08-10|website=[[The Fader]]|language=en|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as shows at the [[Echo Arena Liverpool]] and the [[SSE Hydro]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/lana-del-rey-liverpool-glasgow-uk-tour-dates-2116371|title=Lana Del Rey announces Liverpool and Glasgow UK dates|date=2017-07-26|work=[[NME]]|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, 2017, Del Rey confirmed in a video via [[Instagram]] that she would be embarking on an official world tour in support of ''Lust for Life'', as her first official headlining concert tour since [[The Endless Summer Tour]] in 2015, which was in support of ''[[Ultraviolence (album)|Ultraviolence]]''. Del Rey teased many details of the tour during the following weeks, she informed fans of what continents she would be visiting and how to purchase tickets through presale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gamp|first=Joe|title=Lana Del Rey announces world tour in support of chart-topping album Lust For Life|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/08/19/lana-del-rey-announces-world-tour-in-support-of-chart-topping-album-lust-for-life-6864552/|work=[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]]|date=August 19, 2017|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2018, it was announced that American singer [[Børns]], whom Del Rey had recently collaborated with on two tracks for his second studio album ''[[Blue Madonna]]'', would be joining Del Rey as the opening act for the Australian leg of the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lana Del Rey Tour 2018 Australia, Dates and Tickets|url=https://www.secretsounds.com/tours/lana-del-rey-tour-2018/|publisher=Secret Sounds|accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and stage==
In an interview with [[MTV]] during October 2017, Del Rey stated that she was working to create a stage design for the tour that incorporates "lots of senses", and beach themed projections with "beautiful structures that move in and out of the stage to give it a classic feeling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lana Del Rey Talks Next Music Video &amp; Tour w/ Kali Uchis &amp; Jhené Aiko &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; MTV News|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTUk2AOuZhM|work=[[YouTube]]|date=October 31, 2017|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage design, designed by Jason Ardizzone-West, was revealed once the tour began on January 5, 2018. The stage features an array of beach-themed props and is backed by a large screen displaying visuals designed by Storme Whitby-Grubb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Set Design — Lana Del Rey Arena Tour 2018|url=http://www.ardizzonewest.com/setdesign#/lana-del-rey/|publisher=Jason Ardizzone-West|accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terence Cawley of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' described the set-up as a "microcosm of  [Del Rey's] beloved California" with a display of rock formations, palm trees, and beach chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cawley|first=Terence|title=California dreaming with Lana Del Rey at TD Garden|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2018/01/14/california-dreaming-with-lana-del-rey-garden/U9llaM9lKElBlRGWAPjTPJ/story.html|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=January 14, 2018|accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reed Fischer of ''GoMN'' similarly described the stage as "pure Los Angeles", suiting the title of the tour, "LA to the Moon", with "projections of crashing waves, a fast-moving highway, and a sun-drenched swimming pool danced on the stage floor throughout the night".&lt;ref name="GoMN"/&gt;

'''Lars "Lasse" Nils Berghagen''' (born 13 May 1945&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birthday.se/sok/?f=Lars&amp;l=Berghagen |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120905014458/http://www.birthday.se/sok/?f=Lars&amp;l=Berghagen |archivedate=2012-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[singer]], [[songwriter]] and [[actor]].

Berghagen is a well known singer-songwriter in Sweden. He released his first record in 1965, aged just 19. Four years later, in 1969, he released the single ''[[Teddybjörnen Fredriksson]]'' ("The Teddybear Fredriksson"), which has become a classic. Other hits include ''[[Sträck ut din hand (song)|Sträck ut din hand]]'', ''[[En kväll i juni]]'' and ''[[Stockholm i mitt hjärta]]''.

Berghagen won the Swedish [[Melodifestivalen 1975|1975 Melodifestivalen]] with the song ''[[Jennie, Jennie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svt.se/melodifestivalen/ommelodifestivalen/melodifestivalen-1975 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719232510/http://svt.se/melodifestivalen/ommelodifestivalen/melodifestivalen-1975 |archivedate=2012-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated in [[Melodifestivalen 1974]] with the song ''[[Min kärlekssång till dig]]'' ("My Lovesong For You"), taking second place (after [[ABBA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svt.se/melodifestivalen/ommelodifestivalen/melodifestivalen-1974 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719075037/http://svt.se/melodifestivalen/ommelodifestivalen/melodifestivalen-1974 |archivedate=2012-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He hosted the popular summer TV show ''[[Allsång på Skansen]]'' (''Singalong at Skansen'') from 1994 to 2003. During his time as host the show increased its ratings from 600,000 to 2,000,000 viewers, which by Swedish standards is considered an impressive rating (Sweden has approximately 10,000,000 inhabitants).

He was married to singer [[Barbro Svensson|Barbro "Lill-Babs" Svensson]] from 1965 to 1968. He is the father of actress and TV personality [[Malin Berghagen]], and the father-in-law of [[Tommy Nilsson]].

Berghagen also holds the official world record for hitting a golf ball the longest distance, from one country, through another and into a third.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} This was done at [[Treriksröset]], when he hit a golf ball from Norway, through Sweden, and into Finland.

{{Dynamic list}}
The following is a list of recurring games, sketches, and other comedy routines from the [[NBC]] late night talk show ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'', and its predecessor, ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]''. The sketches feature host [[Jimmy Fallon]], house band [[The Roots]], announcer/sidekick [[Steve Higgins]], the show's writers, celebrity guests, and audience members. Most of the skits below appeared only on ''Late Night'', while some have carried over to the ''Tonight Show''.

==Weekly routines==

===Pros and Cons===
Every Tuesday on the show, Jimmy weighs the pros and cons of a topic that's currently in the news, with the pros being the setups and the cons being the punchlines.  (e.g. Pro: With Tiger competing, this year's Masters promises to be the most exciting golf tournament ever. Con: That being said, it's still golf.) Special editions of the sketch include: "The reissue of the [[Rolling Stones]]' album ''[[Exile on Main St.]]''", in which Jimmy was joined via satellite by [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Richards]] and [[Charlie Watts]]; one in which the topic was "The New NFL Season", where Jimmy was joined by [[Justin Tuck]] of the [[New York Giants]]; and "The NFL Playoffs" with [[New York Jets]] placekicker [[Nick Folk]].

===''Tonight Show'' #Hashtags===
Every Thursday (formerly Wednesday) on the show, Jimmy reads off viewer comments from a topic for discussion he started the night before on [[Twitter]]. Topics have included "My parents are weird", "Why don't they make that?", "Beach fail", and "Makes Me Mad"

Jimmy previously created a spin-off named "Late Night [[Instagram]]s".

===Thank-you Notes===
Nearly every Friday on the show, Jimmy writes thank-you notes. He claims that Friday is the day he catches up on "personal stuff" like checking his inbox, returning e-mails, and writing his weekly thank-you notes. He explains that he is running behind and asks the audience if they wouldn't mind if he took time out of the show to write them, and asks [[James Poyser]] to play some accompanying music (a sped-up version of U2's "[[October (song)|October]]"). The notes are sarcastic in tone and involve current events, people in the news, or things that annoy Jimmy (e.g. "Thank you, [[pony tail]]s, for turning the backs of girls' heads into horses' butts").

The sketch airs on Thursday during the week of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], in deference to the holiday. The sketch aired on Thursday, March 28, 2013, because the show was off for [[Good Friday]] that year.  It also aired on Thursday, February 5, 2015, during the ''Tonight Show'''s week in Los Angeles (the show did not air on Friday that week).

Jimmy also wrote out a special [[2010 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]]-themed set of thank you notes during [[NBC]]'s prime-time Olympic coverage on February 26, 2010 (a Friday); anchor [[Bob Costas]] "played" the usual thank you note-writing music (by pretending to play along on a keyboard while a pre-recorded track of the music played in the background).  Costas and Jimmy reprised the bit with a [[2012 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]]-themed set on August 10, 2012 (also a Friday).

[[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[Michael Bloomberg]] joined Jimmy behind the desk to write out some thank-you notes of his own on Friday, December 13, 2013.

[[Regis Philbin]] joined Jimmy with a little help to write out some thank-you notes of his own on Friday, June 19, 2015.

NASA astronaut [[Scott Kelly (astronaut)|Scott Kelly]] wrote the first thank-you note in space, during his year-long mission to the International Space Station.

President [[Barack Obama]] joined Jimmy in writing out some thank-you notes on Thursday, June 9, 2016.

It was announced on January 31, 2011 that Fallon had signed a book deal to publish entries from the series as two books, the first of which, ''Thank You Notes'', was released May 23, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/01/jimmy_fallon_book_deal.html|title=Jimmy Fallon Gets a Book Deal|last=Paskin|first=Willa|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]|date=January 31, 2011|accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thank You Notes [Paperback]|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0892967412|work=Amazon.com|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequel, ''Thank You Notes 2'', was released on May 22, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thank You Notes 2 [Paperback]|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0892967366|work=Amazon.com|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new book also has a limited edition which has a sound chip that plays the "Thank-you Notes" theme music (to which Jimmy replies "We don't even need James Poyser any more", then the camera cuts to Poyser looking depressed).

===The Week in Review===
Also on Fridays, Jimmy shows a mashup of news anchors reading the week's biggest headlines, set to music.

===''Tonight Show'' Superlatives===
Done on Wednesdays mostly during the NFL season. Similar to a high school yearbook, Jimmy shows pictures of NFL players and says what "Most likely to…" awards they received, to promote the players on the teams of that week's episode of ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'', which are simply based on what they look like. He also does it for random celebrities (including the cast of the new season of ''The Bachelorette''), as well as NHL and NBA players, whose playoffs also air on NBC. For the final version of the skit on ''Late Night'', NFL players listed the awards for the show's writers. They then doused Jimmy with Gatorade. Jimmy then gave away Super Bowl tickets to a lucky audience member.

===Screengrabs===
Sort of an updated version of [[Jay Leno]]'s "[[Headlines (Jay Leno)|Headlines]]", Fallon shows viewer-submitted screen shots from various media (phones, Internet, television, etc.) that contain typos or similar accidentally funny errors, using an [[iPad]] ([[Apple Inc.]] is one of the show's main sponsors). The final selection is always a picture of a man who the viewer claims looks like Jimmy, who will then put on a costume to match.

===Trump News Network===
Citing [[Donald Trump]]'s distrust of mainstream news, Jimmy appears as the President on "Trump News Network" in which he unsuccessfully spins negative stories about him to portray him in a more positive light, instead having the reverse effect.

==TV parodies==

===''7th Floor West''===
In the first two seasons was a parody of the [[MTV]] series ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]'', documenting Jimmy's arrival to ''Late Night'' and his initial struggles in the beginning of the show, such as whether to wear a red tie or a blue tie on his premiere episode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/video/clips/7th-floor-west-part-1-3509/1055381/ NBC.com - Late Night with Jimmy Fallon - 7th Floor West Episode 1, Part 1]&lt;/ref&gt;  Season 1 of the series dealt with Jimmy's passive-aggressive power struggle with [[A.D. Miles]], ''Late Night'''s head writer.  Future ''Saturday Night Live'' cast member [[Jenny Slate]] appeared as Jimmy's assistant who betrayed his trust by collaborating with Miles. New installments premiered every Monday during the summer of 2009, and have a storyline focused on continuity, much as ''The Hills'' does.

Season two finds Miles, having moved to the costume department in the season one finale, unhappy with his new role and wishing he was back among the writing staff.  As revenge, he dresses Jimmy in ridiculous clothes in order to make Jimmy look like an idiot.  During the season, Jimmy and Miles both run for the position of fire warden of the floor. In the series finale, Jimmy and Miles decide to end their silly feud and be friends again, Jimmy gives Miles his job in the writing department back, and they appointed fire-safety enthusiast [[Questlove]] to be fire warden.

===''Real Housewives of Late Night''===
''Real Housewives of Late Night'' is a recurring parody of the various ''[[The Real Housewives of...]]'' reality shows with five cast members playing the roles of their fictional "wives". The cast includes ''Late Night'' host [[Jimmy Fallon]] as power-mad Denise, announcer [[Steve Higgins]] as gravel-voiced chain smoker Lydia, [[The Roots|Roots]] bassist [[Owen Biddle (musician)|Owen Biddle]] as alcoholic Renee, head writer [[A.D. Miles]] as uptight Dale (who is usually accompanied by her son Caleb, who is allergic to all food other than a special paste), and 'director' (in reality, writer) [[Bashir Salahuddin]] as compulsive eater Yvonne.  Each segment continues from the last in an overarching story similar to ''7th Floor West''. The plot revolves around alliances and over-the-top rivalries between the characters resulting in exaggerated responses by the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/real-housewives-of-late-night/ |title=The Real Housewives of Late Night |publisher=Latenightwithjimmyfallon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda|Today Show's Fourth Hour]]'' hosts [[Kathy Lee Gifford]] and [[Hoda Kotb]] appeared on the set of their show during one episode.

When the show was in [[Indianapolis]] for [[Super Bowl XLVI]], the housewives met up with some of the "wives" of the [[Indianapolis Colts]] players (actually the players themselves in drag), including [[Dallas Clark]]'s wife Sherry, [[Pierre Garçon]]'s wife Noelle, [[Antoine Bethea]]'s wife Daris, [[Robert Mathis]]'s wife Shay-Shay, and [[Dan Orlovsky]]'s wife Marianne. During the episode, Denise inadvertently started a fight with the Colts wives when she mistakenly congratulated the Colts on making the Super Bowl (thinking the game was played at one of the teams' home stadium), and was informed they were actually the league's worst team that season, with their [[2011 Indianapolis Colts season|2-14 record]]. This caused Denise and Yvonne to quickly resolve their differences and unite against the Colts wives, causing the ''Late Night'' wives to win the brawl.

===''6-Bee''===
Named after ''Late Night'''s location at 30 Rock, Studio 6B, ''6-Bee'' is a parody of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''.  After Jimmy goes to an NBC accountant (played by [[Fred Armisen]]) to request money for cue cards, he is turned down because the $375 they would cost is too expensive.  However, Jimmy discovers that the first place prize money for glee club sectionals (a flyer for which is conveniently posted in the hallway outside Studio 6B across from a row of lockers) is $380, so he decides to gather the ''Late Night'' crew – including [[A. D. Miles]], [[Paula Pell]], [[Bashir Salahuddin]], and [[Abby Elliott]] from ''[[Saturday Night Live|SNL]]'' – together to compete.  As practice, they sing the [[Bon Jovi]] song "[[Livin' on a Prayer]]".

Later, Jimmy and the ''Late Night'' squad discover that the cast of the NBC show ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' (including [[Amy Poehler]], [[Rashida Jones]], [[Nick Offerman]], [[Aubrey Plaza]], and [[Chris Pratt]]) will also be competing in sectionals – and ''Parks &amp; Rec'' has recruited [[The Roots]] to be in their squad.  Jimmy is so frustrated by the Roots' defection that he sings the [[Twisted Sister]] song "[[We're Not Gonna Take It (Twisted Sister song)|We're Not Gonna Take It]]" (which, eventually, both squads join in on).

Episode two of ''6-Bee'' won an Emmy in the category "Outstanding Short Form Picture Editing" at the [[62nd Primetime Emmy Awards|2010 Primetime]] [[Creative Arts Emmy Award|Creative Arts Emmys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/62ndemmys_noms_4.pdf |title=62nd Emmys nominations |publisher=Emmys |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=HollywoodNews.com |url=http://www.hollywoodnews.com/2010/08/22/primetime-creative-emmys-roundup-hbo-betty-white-are-hits/ |title=Primetime Creative Emmys Roundup: HBO, Betty White are hits |publisher=HollywoodNews.com |date=2010-08-22 |accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Dayvon, the [[Mnemonic]] Pimp (Dion Flynn) arrives to give the viewers a way to remember things such as:
** the order of the planets ("'''[[Mercury (planet)|M]]'''ashandra's '''[[Venus|V]]'''ajayjay '''[[Earth|E]]'''rstwhile '''[[Mars|M]]'''aquisha's '''[[Jupiter|J]]'''ugs '''[[Saturn|S]]'''eximify [[Uranus|'''U'''ranus]] '''[[Neptune|N]]'''ow-one-of-you-bitches-be-holdin'-out-on-me-and-you-know-that-I'mma-git-cha")

They once sang about [[Six Flags]] amusement parks as "Ladysmith Theme Park Mombazo".

The Ben &amp; Jerry's version of the sketch began the show's relationship with that company, which ultimately led to the release of the show's official flavor, "Late Night Snack".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

Jimmy as [[Eddie Vedder]] performed a parody of the [[Pearl Jam]] song "[[Jeremy (song)|Jeremy]]" about basketball phenom [[Jeremy Lin]] of the [[New York Knicks]].{{when|date=November 2015}}

====Tebowie====
Jimmy dresses in an amalgam of [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]-era [[David Bowie]]'s costume, the face makeup from the cover of the Bowie album ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'', and NFL quarterback [[Tim Tebow]]'s uniform and sings a song about events in Tebow's life to the tune of a Bowie song.
* a song about an imagined conversation between Tebow and [[Jesus Christ]] in which Tebow asks for help in their upcoming playoff game against the [[New England Patriots]] (to the tune of "[[Space Oddity]]"). Jesus rejects Tebow's request and tells him to stop calling him.
* a song about [[Peyton Manning]]'s signing with the [[Denver Broncos]] (to the tune of "[[Ziggy Stardust (song)|Ziggy Stardust]]")
* a song about Tebow's signing by the [[New England Patriots]] as a backup to [[Tom Brady]] (to the tune of "[[Rebel Rebel]]")

The first song (titled "Tebowie") was released as a 7" vinyl record as a 2012 [[Record Store Day]] exclusive.  (The B side was a cover of the ''[[Reading Rainbow]]'' theme song sung in the style of [[The Doors]].)

====Chicken Band====
Jimmy, [[Blake Shelton]], [[Nick Offerman]], and writer Chris Tartaro dressed up in chicken suits and sang [[The Lumineers]]' "[[Ho Hey]]", but replaced all the lyrics with chicken clucks, singing as the band "The Chickeneers" on a show before Easter in 2013.

In April 2013, Jimmy, Tartaro, [[Amy Poehler]], and [[Michael Bublé]] formed the band "cluck." and sang "[[Some Nights (song)|Some Nights]]" by [[Fun (band)|fun]].

On November 4, 2015, Jimmy and Tartaro were joined by [[Meghan Trainor]] and [[Alanis Morissette]] to perform Morissette's "[[Ironic (song)|Ironic]]".

====Brian Williams: Gangsta Rapper====
Numerous clips of [[Brian Williams]] from ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' broadcasts are edited together to make it look like Williams is rapping classic songs. So far the songs have been [[Snoop Dogg]]'s part of "[[Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang]]", [[Warren G]]'s "[[Regulate (song)|Regulate]]",  [[Ice Cube]]'s part of "[[Straight Outta Compton (song)|Straight Outta Compton]]", [[Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch]]'s "[[Good Vibrations (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch song)|Good Vibrations]]", [[The Sugarhill Gang]]'s "[[Rapper's Delight]]" (which featured a verse by [[Lester Holt]]), [[Young MC]]'s "[[Bust a Move (song)|Bust a Move]]", Snoop Dogg's "[[Gin and Juice]]", and [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]]'s "[[Baby Got Back]]".

Sketch has not been performed since Williams' suspension from NBC News in February 2015.

*[[Styx (band)|Styx]]'s music video for "[[Too Much Time on My Hands]]" (April 2016) 
*[[Go West (band)|Go West]]'s music video for "[[King of Wishful Thinking]]" (February 9, 2018).

==== First Drafts of Rock ====
Dressed to resemble their original performers, Jimmy and [[Kevin Bacon]] perform a parody of a classic song under the guise of it being an early draft of the actual lyrics.

Examples have included "[[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]]" (where most of its lyrics were centered upon a hamburger stand, and eventually consisting entirely of the word "hamburger"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/08/kevin-bacon-jimmy-fallon-beach-boys|title=Kevin Bacon And Jimmy Fallon Are Having More “Fun Fun Fun” Than You|last=Locker|first=Melissa|work=HWD|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.axs.com/news/kevin-bacon-and-jimmy-fallon-have-fun-with-beach-boys-parody-62720|title=Kevin Bacon and Jimmy Fallon have fun with Beach Boys parody|work=AXS|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Free Fallin']]" (which focuses extensively on the interests of a woman mentioned in the first verse of the actual song, such as her apparent love of horses),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/watch-jimmy-fallon-kevin-bacon-rewrite-free-fallin-on-tonight-251973/|title=Watch Fallon, Kevin Bacon Rewrite 'Free Fallin" on 'Tonight'|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=2016-08-30|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steel Channel shows===

====Ultimate Mustache Fighter====
Jimmy and Steve Higgins play fight commentators Brock Leonard and "The Professor" Barry Star on NBC's "sister network", the (fictitious) Steel Channel (a parody of [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]).  The fight (or as Steel Channel calls them "Stache Bash" with a number and unique name for each one) takes place in an octagonal cage similar to that used for [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] bouts, with actual UFC referee and a bikini clad [[ring girl]].  Competitors thus far include the mustaches of [[Wilford Brimley]], [[Geraldo Rivera]], [[Gene Shalit]], [[John Stossel]], [[Carlos Santana]], "'80s [[Larry Bird]]" (which also did a run-in), "'70s [[Burt Reynolds]]", "'80s [[Tom Selleck]]", "'80s [[John Oates]]", [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil McGraw]],  [[Albert Einstein]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Herman Cain]] and [[Mario|Super Mario]] (with [[List of professional wrestling terms#R|run-ins]] by "'70s [[David Crosby]]" (covered in a [[cocaine|white powder]]), what was originally thought to be [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s mustache that turned out to actually be the mustache of [[Adolf Hitler]], "'80s [[Julius Erving|Dr. J]]", and "The Masked Mustache" (wearing a [[lucha libre|luchador]]-style mask, whose identity was revealed during the ''Detective Jam Face'' ad)).  The most recent bout was [[Ron Swanson]] vs. [[Yosemite Sam]] with run-ins by Wilford Brimley and Super Mario.  (The mustache costumes are normally approximately six feet wide and completely cover the head and arms of the people inside them.)  During the fight, a [[digital on-screen graphic]] advertising a new program on the Steel Channel - usually ''Detective Jam Face'' (played by [[A.D. Miles]]), but also once ''Mustaches on Ice'' (a Christmas special featuring the UMF competitors performing ice skating routines) - interrupts, covering the entire screen for a few seconds.  When the ad goes away, we return to find the fight is over, with Brock and Barry proclaiming the finish a history-making event and the finishing move something they've never seen before and will probably never see again.

====Kicking Stuff====
Another program on the Steel Channel ("from the creators of Ultimate Mustache Fighter") is ''Kicking Stuff'', where a man named Jonathan (Bobby Tisdale) takes ordinary objects, places them on top of an overturned orange bucket, and then kicks them off.  After kicking the object, he points at the camera and yells "Kicking stuff!"

After showing some footage from the show, Jimmy brings out Jonathan and has him kick something live in studio.

====Sports Freak-Out!====
The Steel Channel's sports report, somewhat of a parody of ''[[SportsCenter]]''.  Jimmy and Higgins play "extreme" anchors Cory van Funk and Bert Donovan, respectively.  The report consists of a few segments: "Check Out This Dude", where they make fun of pictures of athletes; "Point / Counterpunch", where one anchor (usually Donovan) makes an argument and the other (usually van Funk) responds by punching him in the face; and "Making Terrible Things Happen With Our Minds", where video clips are intercut with close-ups of the anchors' faces concentrating, and then the person in the clip has an accident. In a recent version, [[Chris Kattan]] appeared as a depressed skateboarding teenager who reviews monster truck shows; when the hosts got him to open up about what was bothering him (beliefs he is unloved by his father), they cut him off and finished the sketch.  The sketch ends with the anchors blowing on an animal horn to summon the "T-shirt yeti", who comes out and throws T-shirts into the audience.

===Audience Suggestion Box===
Jimmy opens this sketch by saying, "We're always striving to get better here at ''The Tonight Show.''" This is followed by him and The Roots imitating a bar from [[Daft Punk]]'s ''[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]'', which punctuates the camera zooming in on Jimmy four times. Suggestions ranging from the mundane ("book [[Sandra Bullock]] soon" or "more audience member close-ups") to the silly (such as "have a stuntman dressed as [[Abraham Lincoln]] fall down the stairs" or "recreate the cover of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'' with a grown man instead of a baby") are supposedly contributed by audience members.  A frequent "suggestion" is to have Black Simon &amp; Garfunkel (actually The Roots' Captain Kirk and Questlove, complete with an album cover parodying ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]'') perform a current pop song in the style of a [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]] song (always ending with the "lie-la-lie" chorus from the song "[[The Boxer]]").

=== ''Bothered'' with Robert Pattinson ===
In this segment, Jimmy presents videos from a website &lt;http://RobertIsBothered.com&gt; that [[Robert Pattinson]] has set up to discuss things that bother him.  Jimmy stars as Pattinson in character as [[Edward Cullen]] from the ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight films]]'', but with his actual British accent. Throughout the segment he sits in a tree and talks about what bothers him, all from the perspective of Pattinson.  Also making an appearance is a blow-up doll representing [[Kristen Stewart]].
Things bothering Robert include [[Daniel Radcliffe]] (a competing video shows Radcliffe as [[Harry Potter]] – also played by Fallon – is bothered by Pattinson), [[Shark Week]], [[Snickers]] ads in magazines, Halloween costumes and candy, the novel ''[[New Moon (book)|New Moon]]'' and vampires in general, [[Valentine's Day]], the [[iPad]], the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], and [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]].  On March 1, 2010, celebrating Jimmy's first year of hosting, the real Pattinson came on to promote the film ''[[Remember Me (2010 film)|Remember Me]]''. During the sketch, he interrupted Jimmy, saying "I don't talk like that!" Jimmy then asked Robert how that made him feel, eventually getting him to say "bothered!"

===''Reflections'' with Justin Bieber===
Jimmy as [[Justin Bieber]] will sit by a reflecting pool and discuss topics that are on his mind.  He will begin by talking about his own life (his appearance on ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', his new position as host of ''[[Punk'd]]''), but then start rambling on about more serious topics, such as [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories]], the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], his fears that [[Economy of China|China's economy]] will overtake that of the [[Economy of the United States|United States]], and the debate over [[human cloning]]. It also shows him dancing, eating snacks, and receiving phone calls from other celebrities such as President [[Barack Obama|Obama]], [[Chuck Norris]], and [[Alan Greenspan]].  (The real Bieber joined Jimmy-as-Bieber during the dance segments on the installment which aired the day before the release of Bieber's movie ''[[Justin Bieber: Never Say Never]]''.)  At the end the segment, Bieber leaves in a magical fashion, such as walking on water, opening a [[wormhole]], or transforming himself into golden retriever puppy Gary Frick from the "[[#If Puppies Could Vote|If Puppies Could Vote]]" sketch.

After the November 2011 paternity rumors involving Bieber, Jimmy-as-Bieber came on the show and performed his new song, "(It's Not My) [[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]".

===Head Swap===
Jimmy introduces a segment which will supposedly present images of two celebrities whose heads have been swapped through digital [[photo manipulation]]. A "Head Swap" song plays, ostensibly a short introductory jingle using sing-a-long lyrics and illustrated by a series of still photos. However, the song becomes an extended narrative set in the offices of ''Late Night'', depicting Jimmy asking a member of the show's graphics department to create "Head Swap" images. In each instance of the sketch, a different set of bizarre complications ensue, involving Jimmy in outlandish situations (such as the accidental death of a co-worker and their attempts to hide the body because the graphic artist is on parole didn't want to go back to prison for her murder; although at the end she was only unconscious) which push the actual "Head Swap" to a secondary issue. The conflict is eventually resolved, and only one image of a "Head Swap" is shown as the song ends.

===Letters Home / Letters to Santa===
Various members of the show's crew, and often one of the guests, read letters they have written to their parents in the manner of children at a summer camp.  While they are reading, an overlay of the actual letter slowly comes into view.  Lastly, Jimmy takes out some [[parchment]], an [[ink]] well, and a large [[quill]] and proceeds to write his letter, in [[calligraphy]], in [[Victorian era]]-style language with a voice to match.

During the Christmas season, the letters are written to Santa Claus instead.  In honor of the final episode of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', the sketch aired with letters written to [[Oprah Winfrey]].

===The 12 Days of Christmas Sweaters===
A yearly Christmas tradition on the show (according to Jimmy) is bringing out a large board (the Countdown to Christmas Cabinet) with 12 numbered doors in the manner of an [[Advent calendar]].  The number of the door opened corresponds to the number of days left before the show's holiday break.  Behind each door is a stereotypical Christmas sweater.  Jimmy picks a number out of a Santa hat, and whomever in the audience has that number wins that day's sweater.

In 2013, an abbreviated version of the series ("The 5 Days of Christmas Sweaters") aired.

===''Late Night'' Stocking Stuffers===
In a manner reminiscent of Oprah on her talk show, Jimmy gives a gift to the entire audience each day during the last week before the show's holiday break.

===New iPhone Apps===
Jimmy plugs in his [[iPhone]] to a monitor to show off some new applications he's discovered.  One of these apps always deals with a picture of the head of comedian [[Paul Reiser]] (such as "ReiserTris", a [[Tetris]]-like game with Reiser heads instead of the regular Tetris blocks). On a recent version, Jimmy used an app designed to locate Reiser, and it displayed "I am 8 feet behind you", then Reiser did a cameo. Another recurring app is "[[Axl Rose]] Relaxation Tapes", with the [[Guns N' Roses]] frontman (actually Jimmy) singing over relaxing sounds such as wolves howling or thunderstorms, usually ending with him yelling "Take a nap!"

The official ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'' iPhone app, released November 10, 2010, has a feature called "Jimmy's Phone", which allows users to use some of the apps featured in the sketch, including "Axl Rose Relaxation Tapes", "[[Moldova]] Y/N" (which uses your phone's [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] to tell you whether or not you're currently in that eastern European nation), "iBanana" (which allows the user to virtually peel and eat a banana), "Lint Brush" (allowing users to virtually clean lint off themselves), "Wet Cement" (allowing users to virtually draw in wet cement), and "Bieber yourself" (allowing users to photoshop [[Justin Bieber]]'s hair on to pictures of themselves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/11/08/app-watch-late-nights-jimmy-fallon-shows-us-jimmys-phone/|title=App Watch: Late Night’s Jimmy Fallon Shows Us ‘Jimmy’s Phone’|last=Fowler|first=Geoffrey A.|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 8, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Who Cares ''Hindenburg''===
After Jimmy briefly mentions three trivial celebrity news items, he declares that the stories should be placed into the "Who Cares ''Hindenburg''." Steve Higgins provides new narration to the classic [[Hindenburg Disaster Newsreel Footage|newsreel footage]] of the destruction of the [[zeppelin]] ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg]]'' (imitating [[Herbert Morrison (announcer)|Herbert Morrison]]'s "Oh, the humanity" radio narration).  The newsreel footage has had a news crawl featuring the three news items superimposed over the zeppelin to make it look like a modern [[blimp]].  The new narration always ends with the exclamation "Who cares?"  A frequent target is [[Fall Out Boy]] bassist [[Pete Wentz]].

===?uestions===
We listen in on [[The Roots|Roots]] drummer [[Questlove|?uestlove]] as he thinks some quasi-intellectual thoughts such as "what do you do when the fire escape catches on fire?" or "how do you throw out a trash can?" (he cocks his head and looks off into the distance, nodding occasionally, as we listen to his pre-recorded narration).

===Andy Rooney===
In "Post-Apocalypse Andy Rooney", Jimmy plays former ''[[60 Minutes]]'' commentator [[Andy Rooney]] as he gives his thoughts about life in a world after a nuclear war and [[zombie]] uprising.

After Rooney's retirement, the sketch became "What is Andy Rooney doing now?", showing how Rooney is spending his free time, (i.e. calling everyone in the phone book and ranting to anyone that will listen).

Jimmy stopped doing Rooney impressions after the real Rooney's death in late 2011.

===Obama Expressions===
Jimmy, claiming to be an expert on facial expressions, explains the meanings behind numerous expressions made by U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]. The expressions are usually explained by a short phrase (such as "determined yet hopeful"), until the end of the segment, which features pictures from President Obama's February 2009 meeting with Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]]; at this point the phrases become overly long drivel about 1980s or 1990s youth popular culture (often food and sitcoms), reminiscing over minute details about the subject.  Jimmy once did this segment with photos of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] in place of Obama.

===He Said, She Said===
Somewhat similar to "Obama Expressions", Jimmy shows a series of photos, each showing a man and a woman.  Jimmy then explains what the people in the photos are thinking.  The first person's thought is somewhat regular (e.g. "I'm feeding him!  This is so romantic!" for a picture of a wife feeding her husband) while their partner's thought is a humorous rejoinder (e.g. "She's feeding me!  This is so humiliating!").

===Animal Thoughts===
Similar to He Said, She Said, photos of people with their pets are shown, with the pets' thoughts being the punchlines.

===Don't Quote Me===
Jimmy reads off some famous quotes that he found on Facebook, along with some other quotes allegedly by the same person, but of dubious provenance.  (E.g. [[Lance Armstrong]]: "I'll spend the rest of my life trying to earn back trust and apologize to people for the rest of my life."  Also from Armstrong: "Are there any drugs that can help me do that?")

===Speech Timeline===
Often after a speech by President Obama, Jimmy will give a timeline of events, starting with actual statements from the speech.  The bit will eventually introduce Vice President [[Joe Biden]], who will interrupt Obama in the manner of a spoiled child.

===Video Vision===
While cleaning his office, Jimmy claims to have found some [[VHS]] cassettes from a 1980s production company named Video Vision.  The videos are usually short instructional pieces (such as "Dealing with Sexual Harassment in the Workplace"), or holiday guides with bizarre factual errors such as "[[Christmas]] was founded in Downtown [[Europe]]". They are hosted by Jimmy (as ''James'' Fallon) with a spiked haircut, thick glasses, cheesy sweater and faded jeans, and have many of the hallmarks of video production of the mid-80s, including low video quality, awkward scene transitions, choppy edits, low-quality special effects, and cheesy graphics which include typos and spelling errors.  Portions of the video tape may have been "accidentally" taped over with 1980's sitcoms.

===Cupid's Arrow===
Jimmy finds some old tapes of men from a 1980s video dating service that used to tape in Studio 6-B called "Cupid's Arrow". The videos are low quality (possibly because they were produced by Video Vision). The men featured are unattractive losers, and Jimmy stated that most of them were probably still available.

The sketch was later made into a ''[[The Dating Game|Dating Game]]''-style TV show hosted by Tony Sanders (played by Higgins) with three of the men: Chester Mann (played by Salhudtin), a perverted part-time shoe salesman and freeloader; James Spadge (played by Miles), a nerd with unusual medical conditions; and Jose (played by Jimmy), a flamboyant musician; and a female audience member as the contestant, with the video quality downgraded to look like it was from the 1980s. Jose is always the winner.

===Product Placement Preacher===
To get the audience excited about the show's sponsors, a fake gospel preacher named Rev. Daryl Bivens (played by [[Bashir Salahuddin]]) preaches about the products. Products have included the Big Philly Cheesesteak from [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], Previlosec heartburn medication, and [http://www.hulu.com/watch/107480/late-night-with-jimmy-fallon-product-placement-preacher Toby's Rock Salt].

===Shout-Outs===
After Jimmy gives a [[shout-out]] to someone, [[Questlove]] asks Jimmy if he can give a shout-out to someone as well.  After doing so, other members of the cast and crew (usually including [[Kamal Gray]], writer [[Morgan Murphy (comedian)|Morgan Murphy]], director [[Dave Diomedi]] (always to his wife and about their sex life), [[Tariq Trotter]] (usually about some sort of craft or cooking project; Trotter wears a blondish-red wig while demonstrating it), or a character played by [[Bashir Salahuddin]]) interrupt and ask for shout-outs to people or things of their own.  At the end, Jimmy quickly recaps each of the shout-outs.

===New Velvet Elvises===
Jimmy shows a series of [[velvet Elvis]]es (or "velvet Elvii" as Jimmy claims they are also called) showing Presley in contemporary situations, such as listening to an [[iPod]], skydiving, or appearing alongside people like Neytiri from the movie ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', [[Fox News]] commentator [[Glenn Beck]], or the cast of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''.  One of the velvet Elvises will usually include a [[Chatty Cathy|pull-string activated "voice box"]] (Jimmy pulls the string and holds the painting in front of his mouth so the audience cannot see him providing the voice).

The last painting is often of Elvis in a beige jumpsuit performing a particularly boring activity (e.g. taking a nap after doing a crossword puzzle, sitting on a park bench feeding birds).  After Jimmy comments on just how boring the activity is, a Boring Elvis impersonator comes out and sings a song about the activity.

===Rejected Catchphrases===
Jimmy claims to have had a character left out of various movies and video games, such as ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'' or ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]''.  He shows us a series of outtakes of him spouting bad attempts at catchphrases.  Jimmy will also sometimes enlist actors promoting new movies to be in outtakes from those movies with him (including [[Jude Law]] for ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' and [[Kim Cattrall]] for ''[[Sex and the City 2]]'').

===Milky J===
After Jimmy passingly mentions the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], a man in the audience dressed head to toe in [[New York Yankees]] apparel named Milky J ([[Bashir Salahuddin]]) enthusiastically begins listing and showing photos of astronomical features photographed by the telescope, each one punctuated by him yelling "Hubble gotchu!" He also sang a song about it, and later showed a rap video he made.  This sketch's timing may be based on the song "Rock You" by The Roots.

He appeared in a recent shout-outs sketch, sending shout-outs to molecular models. Jimmy said he recognized him and Milky J explained that since Hubble is being phased out and replaced by the [[James Webb Space Telescope]], he'd found a new interest. Jimmy then convinced him that Hubble is still something to get excited about, which made him go back into his old shtick.

Later, Jimmy mentioned a new planet, and Milky J showed up and went into his routine, but Jimmy once again mentioned how Hubble is being replaced by the James Webb telescope.  Milky J then did a rap video about his trip to [[NASA]]'s [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]] to try to convince them to stop the new telescope from being launched.

Milky J recently appeared in another shoutouts sketch, this time giving a shoutout to gravity: breaking his unfaithful wife's valuables by dropping them and saying "gravity got it".

===How You Like Me Now?===
Jimmy begins telling a story, but a man in the crowd wearing a [[Hawaiian shirt]] and a [[New York Mets]] bucket hat (Mike Dicenzo) interrupts, linking the beginning of Jimmy's story to ''Late Night'' via an extended [[Word Association|word association]], after which he says "how you like me now?".  After he does it twice, Jimmy does one as well, causing the man to declare Jimmy the superior player and leave the studio in shame, despite Jimmy's repeated attempts to make him stay.

During the sketch that aired March 11, 2013, as Bucket Hat guy went to leave, Laina the [[Overly Attached Girlfriend]] appeared near the exit, wearing an identical Hawaiian shirt and bucket hat.  Despite Jimmy's attempts to get the two of them together, Bucket Hat Guy retreated from the exit to the safety of Jimmy's guest chair.

===At the Bar with Roger Federer===
Jimmy shows a clip from a late-night [[Tennis Channel]] show starring [[Roger Federer]] (played by Jimmy) called ''At the Bar with Roger Federer'', where the tennis star hangs out in a bar and does strange things, including performing [[yo-yo]] tricks, identifying objects (incorrectly) by smell, and discussing his love/hate relationship with his good friend but fierce competitor [[Rafael Nadal]]. The sketch only airs during [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam Tennis Tournaments]], the current one of which Federer discusses during "The Sports" segment. The most recent edition of this sketch involved Federer buying "a round of drinks on the Federer," then serving a tennis ball between his legs so it causes [[John McEnroe]]'s drink to spill, which in turn provokes McEnroe to stand up angrily and yell, "Come on, Roger! God! You cannot be serious!" The camera then cuts back to Federer, who casually says "That one's on me," as if nothing happened.

===Flame Eyes===
Less a full sketch and more a recurring bit, Jimmy will look directly into the camera and jets of fire of will emanate from his eyeballs.  Sometimes, he will instead shoot laser beams.  Less frequently, gobs of cooked [[spaghetti]] will come out.  Jimmy will also have [[Steve Higgins]], [[Questlove]], and his celebrity guests play along with the gag as well.  Jimmy claims the ability to do these things is a side effect of his [[LASIK]] surgery.

===Wrestler Entrances===
When Jimmy has a professional wrestler as a guest, they will usually enter the studio through a cloud of smoke via a trap door in one of the aisles of the audience area.

===Small Town Festivals===
Jimmy will read a pamphlet from an upcoming small town festival for that weekend. It is only done in the summer.

===Tale of the Tape===
Jimmy tells a news story where a person/place/thing is compared to something/one else. He then compares the two usually ending in a punchline joke. In the July 21, 2014 episode he compared Toronto mayor, Rob Ford, with a horse.

===Good Advice, Bad Advice===
Jimmy demonstrates how a common piece of advice, like "let it flow" can take on a very different meaning depending on who you are.

===Do Not Play List===
Jimmy reviews several terrible (real) albums and songs (such as [[Scooter (band)|Scooter]]'s ''[[How Much Is the Fish?]]'', [[Michael Henderson]]'s ''[[Slingshot (album)|Slingshot]]'', [[Hulk Hogan]]'s ''[[The Wrestling Boot Band|Hulk Rules]]'', two tracks off of ''Music To Eat [[Oscar Mayer]] Weiners By'' ([[Motown]] style and [[Bossa Nova]] style), and ''A Taste of Dick Black''). [[Questlove]], an avid music collector, always states he thinks the songs and artists are fake since he's never heard of them.

===Do Not Read List===

Once a month, Jimmy reviews several terrible (real) books (such as ''[[How to Avoid Huge Ships|How to Avoid Huge Ships: Second Edition]]'', ''Castration: The Advantages and the Disadvantages'', ''Cooking With [Winnie the] Pooh'', and ''Knitting With Dog Hair'') and suggests people not read them.

===Do Not Watch List===
Together with the guys from the [[Found Footage Festival]], Jimmy presents selections from old low-quality instructional VHS videos and suggests the audience avoid them (such as the owner's video for the Rejuvenique face mask, ''Superchops 4 Bass with Beaver Felton'', and ''Fun with Ventriloquism'').

===Do Not Game List===
During the show's Video Game Week, Jimmy showcased some terrible games, such as ''[[Hooters Road Trip]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], ''[[Captain Novolin]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], and ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' for the [[Atari 2600]].

===Charlie Sheen commercials===
In the wake of [[Charlie Sheen]]'s post-rehab media blitz, Jimmy appeared as Sheen in two commercials: one selling his cologne "Winning", and the other selling a [[Time Life]] collection of CDs containing outrageous quotes by him.  Later, in response to the news that [[Ashton Kutcher]] would replace Sheen on ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', Jimmy as Sheen made a new version of Kutcher's old show ''[[Punk'd]]'' called ''Sheen'd'' in which he goes around acting obnoxious and bothering people at their jobs.  The real Sheen (who also promoted his new show ''[[Anger Management (TV series)|Anger Management]]'') later appeared alongside Jimmy-as-Sheen  in an ad for "Clone" cologne.

===''Celebrity Whispers''===
Jimmy plays British TV show host Peggy Hess, who presents a series of clips of celebrities making small-talk at functions where they are not hooked up to microphones.  Whispering voices are added to the soundtrack to show what the celebrities are saying, such as [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Angelina Jolie]] discussing putting ''[[Cool Runnings]]'' in their [[Netflix]] queue, [[Pope]] [[Benedict XVI]] showing [[Barack Obama]] his fan art of [[Garfield]], and [[Gary Busey]] explaining to [[John C. McGinley]] how he punched a mountain lion in the face and then became best friends with it.

===Questions and Danswers===
Jimmy sent a correspondent to the streets of New York to ask people their thoughts on different topics in the news while dancing their answers.

===Popular Mathematics===
In an effort to make basic math more relatable for kids, Jimmy breaks down basic arithmetic using pop culture references and notable names (e.g. [[Larry David]] + [[Static electricity]] = [[Bernie Sanders]]).

===''Father &amp; Son''===
A series of animated shorts featuring a father (voiced by Jimmy) giving advice to his (silent) preteen son. This segment only airs on the Friday before Father's Day.

===Bargain Bin===
Jimmy showcases some items that he has found on sale at various stores.  The price-reduction stickers have been strategically placed so that their names are more suggestive, turning a copy of ''[[The Very Hungry Caterpillar]]'' into ''The Very Hung Caterpillar'' or a DVD of the show ''[[Picket Fences]]'' into ''Picket Feces''.  A bath toy called "Rub-A-Dub Work &amp; Squirt" was left alone.

===Late Night E-Cards===
Jimmy showcases some interesting electronic greeting cards he's discovered, with the insides being insulting to the receiver.

===Walter Kump===
Jimmy talks about going onto a website that does [[Speech synthesis|computer text-to-speech conversions]], and then mentions that the computer voice is based on that of a nerdy man named Walter Kump (John Haskell).  He then brings out Kump for an interview, which shows off some of the comical mispronunciations, improper enunciation and misuse of punctuation (i.e. saying the word "slash" when a "/" appears in the script) that are prominent of computer-generated voices.

Kump later announced he has chosen a second career as a rapper and has recorded a music video, which Jimmy let him play on the show.

Kump also appeared after his girlfriend (who speaks in a female robot voice) made a video of him falling while he was rollerblading that went viral.

Kump's latest appearance had him announcing he played the hero in an action movie, co-starring [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as the villain, and had Jimmy play a climactic scene from it.

===On the Bright Side===
Jimmy reads a somewhat depressing story from the news and then gives the silver lining.  (Example: There are growing concerns about the level of privacy on [[Facebook]].  On the bright side, there's a way to post all of your information online without anyone ever seeing it – join [[Myspace]].)

===''Night News Now''===
A parody of nightly news programs.  It usually includes inane graphs; short, nonsensical weather reports; depressed sports anchors, and manipulated footage of celebrities where their faces are turned upside-down.

===Russell Brand Reads ''Us Weekly''===
British comedian [[Russell Brand]] (Jimmy) comments on articles in the latest issue of ''[[Us Weekly]]''.  Some episodes have Brand reading ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'' instead. When the real Brand was on in February 2013, he appeared and said Jimmy's impression was terrible and read the magazine himself.

On August 9, 2012, Jimmy joined anchor [[Bob Costas]] in studio at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]], and showed a version of the sketch with Brand reading the special Olympics edition of the magazine.

===Said It and Re-Edit===
Jimmy boils down a week's worth of a TV show to one sentence to allow his viewers to more quickly catch up on them.  The result is a humorous but still appropriate sentence, like [[Rachel Maddow]] from ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'' being edited to say "[[Newt Gingrich]] had an ultrasound, and it revealed a small horse inside his stomach."  The title of the sketch is a take-off of the [[Ronco]] Showtime Rotisserie Grill's slogan "set it and forget it".

===Mitt Romney's Video Blog===
Jimmy as [[Mitt Romney]] attempts to reach younger voters with a video blog, however he proves he is out of touch with them instead.

===Romney and Obama conversations===
Jimmy as Mitt Romney and Dion Flynn as President Obama have one on one private conversations about their Presidential debates. Both candidates criticize themselves and each other.

After President Obama was re-elected on November 6, 2012, they re-enacted Romney's concession call to President Obama, with them reminiscing about the election, then performing a duet of [[Paula Cole]]'s "[[I Don't Want to Wait]]".

===Rumor Has It===
Jimmy will mention celebrity rumors (the setups) then tell the truth behind them (the punchlines).

===In Reply To===
Jimmy shows some celebrity Twitter replies to (fake) fan questions, and then reveals the original question.  (e.g. [[Dalai Lama]]'s reply: "Bountiful, rich, and abundant."  Follower's question: "Describe your ideal guacamole.")  The sketch is also similar in spirit to [[Johnny Carson]]'s "[[Carnac the Magnificent]]" bits on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]''.

==Running gags==

===Bad joke giveaway===
When Jimmy tells a joke in the monologue that he thinks is particularly cheesy, he will apologize then give away its cue cards to members of the audience.

===Gary/Garrison===
Jimmy often refers to fictional men as Gary, who are usually unintelligent or acting obnoxious and people are letting him know this. He also refers to fictional misbehaving boys as Garrison (who hates that name and wishes his parents would call him Gary).

===Hot Sax===
Jimmy and the gang take turns miming the saxophone solo of "[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]" while a recording of it is played.

===Funkin Gonuts===
Whenever a story about [[Dunkin Donuts]] is mentioned, Jimmy says, "Or as I call it, 'Funkin Gonuts'", the Roots then play some funky music, which Jimmy dances to.  After it ends, Higgins says, "Donuts!"

===Hashtag the Panda===
Following a story in his April 23, 2014 monologue about a depressed panda in [[China]], named Seesha, Fallon mentioned that scientists had put a TV in the cage to cheer up the panda. Fallon then told a couple panda jokes for Seesha, and after each joke, a man in a panda suit would cut in front of the screen and do a short dance. Eventually, he worked his way into the hallway where he kept dancing as the Roots continued to play his song. The panda returned the next night, and Fallon sent out a hashtag called #FallonPanda to gather name suggestions. The next night, it was announced the panda's name was "Hashtag." The panda now frequently returns in monologues following a series of jokes, dancing all the way into the hall to the Roots' music. It was later revealed that [[Ben Stiller]] was the man in the Hashtag costume, although when Stiller returned as a guest, [[Chris Rock]] had taken over mascot duties. On May 17, 2017, as part of a promotion for her upcoming single, for ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' coach [[Miley Cyrus]] took a turn inside the suit. During the show's first trip to [[Universal Orlando Resort]] in 2014, Hashtag was part of a dance-off against [[Stuff the Magic Dragon]], the mascot of the [[Orlando Magic]], which ended in a tie. Hashtag the Panda can be seen at the [[Universal Studios Florida]] attraction [[Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon]] for meet-and-greets and also appears inside the attraction.

===Retiring===
When the announcer Steve Higgins says a joke that is both very funny and very cheesy, he will "retire" by waiving to the crowd and walking off the stage. He will then come back, appearing exhausted, then explaining something crazy that happened to him that caused him to come back.

On other occasions, Fallon will "retire."  When either man "retires," the Roots play [[blues]] music.

===Jay Leno does monologue jokes===
Whenever his predecessor [[Jay Leno]] is a guest, Jimmy will feign an injury during the monologue (in the form of allegedly pulling a muscle) and Leno will have to "tag in" and take his spot for a few minutes while he recovers.

====Billy Crystal variation====
One occasion had Jimmy supposedly get a tickle in his throat while telling [[Hillary Clinton]] jokes.  [[Billy Crystal]] took over for the remainder of the monologues.

==Sketches involving audience participation==

===Games===

====Regular games====

=====Lick it For Ten=====
A segment introduced on the show's first episode, in which Jimmy invites audience members to come on stage and lick objects, such as a lawn mower or a bowling ball, for ten dollars.  [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Kelly Ripa]] have played the game as celebrities.

=====Wheel of Carpet Samples=====
Introduced in the show's second week, this segment features a game with loosely defined rules and bizarre scoring whose theme song is an off-key version of ''[[The Final Countdown (song)|The Final Countdown]]''.  Three audience members are chosen to spin a wheel containing various carpet samples. The wheel includes a "mystery sample", which is revealed by the announcer to both the audience and the contestants prior to game play.  Each contestant spins the wheel just once and is awarded a seemingly arbitrary point value (Jimmy tells the second contestant that the point value the first contestant scored is the maximum number of points a contestant can possibly get, and then asks if the second player thinks he or she can beat it). Each game contains the speed round with a "carpet sample fun fact": a piece of trivia, and the "lightning round" in which the contestant must "name as many things as possible" in three seconds (after which Jimmy names a thing that is none of the things the contestant mentioned), and a "carpet sample cartoon break", which is followed by a "the making of" featurette, then a "the making of the making of" featurette, then an epilogue of the makers of them. If a contestant lands on a piece that has already been won, Jimmy turns the wheel back five spaces. A seemingly arbitrary winner, chosen by Higgins (who wasn't paying attention because he was arguing with his wife on the phone), wins the sample of carpet on which the wheel stopped during their spin. The other two contestants each receive a consolation prize that turns out to be much more valuable than the winning contestant's prize, usually a $300 gift card to the Apple Store (the winning contestant is ultimately awarded the consolation prize as well).

=====Cell Phone Shootout=====
Jimmy picks three random audience members to come down. They are shown a table covered in various "prizes", including a large-screen plasma TV (or a MacBook, or other similarly desirable popular item), tickets to a cleaning products convention, a used trumpet, lingerie, recorded VHS tapes, donuts for the entire audience, a box of rocks, a coffee mug, a year's worth of back issues of ''Orthopedics'' magazine, a pipe carved into Jimmy's likeness, a 15-second rave, and other similar kitschy items.  A [[Sharp Aquos|Sharp 108]] shows a rapid-fire series of images of the objects available to be won, with each image only visible for 1/6 of a second.  When Jimmy gives the cue, the contestants must snap a picture with their cellphone of whatever item is on the screen.  The contestant wins whatever item of which they have taken a picture.  One unlucky female contestant's phone was so slow to take a picture that all she photographed was the game's logo after the prizes had stopped flashing.  As a consolation prize, she was awarded "donuts for the entire audience".  A frequent prize is "The Call of the Wolf Waker": a man (Mike Dicenzo) covered head to toe in furs performs a wolf [[game call|call]] using his cupped hands; while he is performing the call, footage of sleeping wolves waking up is shown. Another grand prize was 15 seconds in the VIP room with two Victoria's Secret models.

=====Dance Your Hat and Gloves Off=====
In a parody of ''[[Dance Your Ass Off]]'', Jimmy invites three audience members on stage and challenges them to put on a neon yellow wool knit cap and yellow rubber gloves and try to get them off only by whipping their body parts around.  Jimmy warns that "smurfing" (wearing one's cap loosely and high on the head in the manner of a [[The Smurfs|Smurf]]) is not allowed.  Two points are awarded for removing a hat, with one point each for the gloves; ties are broken based on audience applause.  The winner receives $300 in one dollar bills, although the bills are presented in strange ways, such as wadded up and stuffed in a plastic bag, stuffed into the hollow handle of a snow shovel, or taped end-to-end in a long chain.  Losers receive a T-shirt.  Jimmy closes the segment by reciting a rhyming verse, which in some instances of the sketch becomes absurdly long and about an embarrassing health problem Jimmy has such as genital warts.

=====Karaoke Contest=====
Jimmy challenges three audience members to a [[karaoke]] contest where they sing quotes from a celebrity, including [[Nicole Polizzi]], [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]] and [[Mel Gibson#Allegations of sexism and domestic violence|Mel Gibson]]; most installments use quotes from [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] politicians and commentators, including [[South Carolina]] governor [[Mark Sanford]]; [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] convention speakers [[Tom Tancredo]], [[Joseph Farah]], and [[Sarah Palin]]; Fox News hosts [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Sean Hannity]]; and, most frequently, [[Rush Limbaugh]].  One version featured quotes from the erotic novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]''.  Another featured quotes from recent ''[[Celebrity Apprentice]]'' bootee [[Gary Busey]].  (This installment had only two audience members, with Busey himself also competing; Busey was named the winner, but Jimmy revealed that "friends, family, and the actual Gary Busey" were not eligible to receive prizes.)  The most recent installment featured quotes from the cast of ''[[Duck Dynasty]]''.  The winner, determined by audience applause, receives a karaoke machine, and losers receive T-shirts or hoodies.

=====Hot Dog in a Hole=====
Jimmy invites three guests on stage, and they must attempt to throw the most [[hot dog]]s through holes carved in the mouths of large (about 6 feet tall) celebrity faces.  The celebrities are usually related somehow, such as the cast of ''[[New Moon (2009 film)|New Moon]]'', the three men from the TV show ''[[Full House]]'', hosts on [[Fox News Channel]], or politicians. (An installment of the game after the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] vote on the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health care legislation]] featured Rep. [[Henry Waxman]] (D-CA); the Congressman's face had a smaller-than-usual mouth hole but added cutouts for his nostrils.)  In the case of a tie, contestants participate in a sudden-death toss-off.  The winner receives a [[hot dog toaster]], and the losers receive a package of hot dogs.

=====''Late Night'' Air Drum Challenge=====
Three audience members play air drums (similar to [[air guitar]]) along to a short drum-heavy instrumental track played by [[The Roots]].  The winner is selected by audience applause, who receives a drum kit donated by [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] and [[Avedis Zildjian Company|Zildjian]].  The two losers receive [[drumhead]]s autographed by The Roots.

=====Celebrity Man Boobs=====
Three audience members are each shown three close-up photos of different [[gynecomastia|man boobs]], and are asked to pick which one belongs to a particular celebrity.  The three photos are given punny names such as "[[Area 51|Areola 51]]" or "[[Yo Gabba Gabba!|Yo Flabba-Flabba]]".  Winners receive a man boobs-themed wall calendar, and losers receive a "Man Boobs" T-shirt.

=====Competitive Spit-Takes=====
Two pairs of audience members compete.  One member of each pair rolls a specially marked die to determine whether they will be spitting or receiving.  The spitter takes a sip of water, and then the receiver recites the punch line to a provided joke (usually in the form of "[Normal phrase]?  I thought you said [similar-sounding sexual phrase]!"), at which the spitter performs their best [[spit-take]].  Audience applause determines the winning team.  Sometimes, Jimmy will have the spitter and receiver switch positions if their first spit-take is particularly good or they have extra time.  The winning team receives a pair of hand towels embroidered with the "Competitive Spit-Takes" logo, while the losing team receives a pair of [[wet wipe|moist towelette]]s.

=====Dancing on Air=====
Three audience members select styles of dance (e.g. [[Irish stepdance]], [[ballet]], or [[disco]]) out of Jimmy's "Velvety Dance Bag", and then attempt to perform that dance style after being hung by a harness ten feet in the air.  The winner is selected by audience applause.  The winner receives a dancing-themed prize, such as [[Nintendo]] [[Wii]] and a dancing game or [[Arthur Murray]] dancing lessons, while the losers receive T-shirts.

=====Battle of the Instant Bands=====
Before the show, Jimmy selects members of the audience who are musicians but do not otherwise know each other.  They are split into two "instant bands" and are given about half an hour to come up with a band name, design an album cover, and write a song to perform.  Winners are determined by audience applause.  Winners receive the instruments they played and a $300 gift certificate to [[Guitar Center]], while the losers receive T-shirts.

On the June 15, 2011 show, Jimmy hosted the finalists in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[Garnier|Garnier Fructis]]' "Choose the Cover" contest (Lelia Broussard from Los Angeles, California, and The Sheepdogs from [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]).  Prior to the show, a member of the audience (Terry Patterson from the San Francisco area) was selected and both bands had to write a song about her.  Each member of both bands received a ''Late Night'' T-shirt, and the winning band (The Sheepdogs) received 20 pints of Jimmy's [[Ben &amp; Jerry's]] flavor, "Late Night Snack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finalists Compete in Jimmy Fallon's Battle of the Instant Bands|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/choosethecover/blog/finalists-compete-in-jimmy-fallons-battle-of-the-instant-bands-20110616|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Battle of the Instant Dance Crews=====
Similar to Battle of the Instant Bands, Jimmy assembles two dance crews from the audience and has them each choreograph a dance routine in under an hour.  The winners each receive $300 gift cards from [[J.Crew]], while the losers win $100 gift cards.

=====Battle of the Instant Songwriters=====
Similar to Battle of the Instant Bands, Jimmy selects three singer/songwriters from the audience and has them write a short song based on a different nonsensical phrase like "turtle sunrise" or "clouds are people too".  The winner receives a $300 gift card to [[Guitar Center]], while the losers receive $100 gift cards.

=====Put It In Reverse=====
Two audience members are given a scene to perform with Jimmy in reverse (walking backward, etc.).  After they complete the scene, the footage is then shown reversed so that it looks normal.  The winner is determined by audience applause, who receives a piece of reversible clothing (such as a jacket or a jersey), while the loser receives a tshirt with a reversed ''Late Night'' logo.

=====Spanx But No Spanx=====
Two teams of three male audience members race in a relay to pass a [[Spanx]] body-shaping undergarment over their bodies as fast as possible.  After taking the garment off of a mannequin, the first person steps into it and then pulls the garment over his head.  The next team member then pulls the garment over his head and off over his feet.  The third team member reverses direction once again and pulls the garment on feet-first.  After pulling the garment over his head, the third team member then races to deposit the garment in a basket (the "Spanx Bank").  The other team members may assist in the passing of the garment, but cannot bunch it up or fold it onto itself.  The winning team wins ''Late Night'' compression T-shirts and a pair of Spanx, and the losers receive regular ''Late Night'' T-shirts..

=====Say What!?=====
Three audience members "try to decipher the garbled-mouth ramblings of Rickie Johnston, a pig farmer with a real anger-management problem," according to Jimmy.  Johnston (played by Bobby Tisdale) is a stereotypical [[redneck]], dressed in a pair of overalls, a trucker's hat, and no shirt, in addition to a huge mouthful of [[chewing tobacco]] and an exaggerated [[Southern American English|Southern accent]].  The game has three rounds, worth 10, 100, and 1000 points.  The first two rounds vary, but the third round is always "What's On Rickie's Mini-Dish Tonight?", which involves Johnston acting out a scene from a movie and the contestants must guess its title.  The winner of the first installment of the game had the choice between a chocolate-covered horseshoe and a "beer-amid" (a pyramid made from cement-filled beer cans) as a prize and chose the beer-amid.  The second installment of the game had as its prize a package of paper plates.  The third installment awarded a watch made from a can of chewing tobacco.  The losers receive a bag of frozen [[tater tots]], with Jimmy giving Rickie a bag as well (they're his favorite).

=====Name That Guy=====
Three audience members are shown pictures of non-celebrities and each must guess the first and last name of the person shown. The images of non-famous men flashes quickly with one of a famous man second to last (usually 1990s sitcom stars).  The first two contestants get a single guy to name, but the last contestant plays the "lightning round", where they try to name eight guys in 20 seconds.  They show's grand prize, $15,000, has never been won, but the losers (all contestants are invariably losers) receive a T-shirt with their person's name on it (Higgins encourages all contestants to "wear your shame in style").  The spirit of the game is similar to "[[#Wheel of Carpet Samples|Wheel of Carpet Samples]]".  Due to "lack of budget", the segment uses scene transition graphics from ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' between contestants.  It also features "Name That Guy Fun Facts" like "[non-famous man]" was born in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]]".

Actor [[Charlie Day]] played the game's lightning round on the July 11, 2013 episode.

=====Models and Buckets=====
Jimmy claims this is "the game that everyone is talking about." This is followed by five brief video clips of five different people ([[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Brian Williams]], and [[Glenn Beck]]) strung together so it sounds like they are saying the sentence, "I love Models and Buckets." The twelve models are brought out and Jimmy will ask them an open ended question, such as "How was your weekend?", with each giving a different answer simultaneously. Jimmy then brings in two male audience members who singularly select alternately a bucket held by each model (similar to ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'') that is filled with an item such as food (e.g. orange soda, baked beans, or chocolate syrup), confetti, or packing peanuts to be tipped over the contestant's head by that model. The hope is to find the bucket that contains fake $1 bills. The losing contestant receives a ''Late Night'' [[bucket hat]] (Jimmy and The Roots then begin a rap interlude about the bucket hat).  The initial installment of the game used 16 buckets instead of 12.  When only six buckets remain, the game enters the "double trouble" phase, where each contestant selects a bucket to be tipped simultaneously.  If a contestant wins early in the game, Jimmy will have the models reset with new buckets and the contestants play a second game for another $100. In one installment, both contestants won $100, and the bucket hat was not awarded. Contestants also a receive new clean clothing backstage afterwards.

=====Buzzwords=====
Jimmy had audience members roll a [[Twenty-sided polyhedral die|twenty-sided die]] with a letter on each face (likely taken from the game [[Scattergories]]) and say as many words that start with that letter, with rules such as no proper nouns, no long pauses between words, etc.  Contestants win $10 cash for each correct word.

=====Copy Machine Match Game=====
While two audience members are blindfolded and wear noise-canceling headphones on stage, Jimmy selects another audience member to come down and photocopy their face; after doing so, that person returns to their seat.  Singularly each of two contestants are given the photocopy and the task to run into the audience to find the photocopied person.  While they are searching, the Roots play music whose tempo slows or fastens depending on how "hot" or "cold" the contestant is in their search.  The contestant that finds the photocopied person fastest is declared the winner and receives a desktop [[multifunction printer|printer/fax/scanner/copier]], while both the loser and the photocopied person receive a ream of copy paper.

=====Karate Piñata=====
Three blindfolded audience members attempt to break ball-shaped [[piñata]]s with smiley faces on them (which "bear a striking resemblance to celebrities in the news") rotating around them using only [[karate]] kicks.  Ties are broken by "kicking awesomeness" (as voted on by the audience).  The winner receives $300 worth of [[Old El Paso]] boxed taco kits (brought out by Gwar and Dwar), while the losers receive ''Late Night'' [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]]s.

=====What's Mine Is Yours=====
Five audience members each donate one of their possessions to a communal "jackpot".  Jimmy spices it up by adding the contents of a wallet in his pocket, including $500 (sometimes in cash, sometimes as a gift card to the [[Apple Store]]).

Each of the five audience members has their name on a tile in a bucket.  Jimmy singularly pulls a tile from the bucket to eliminate contestants until only one contestant is left, who wins everything in the jackpot. The other four contestants receive ''Late Night'' T-shirts or sweatshirts.

=====Doll Posin'=====
Three audience members are singularly shown a collectible doll for five seconds, and then have thirty seconds to assume the pose of the doll as closely as possible using a box of props and costumes.  Contestants that have yet to play are placed beneath large blue sensory-deprivation "domes of silence".  The winner is chosen by audience applause; in the first installment, the winner received a three-foot-tall [[Barbie]] doll, but in later installments the prize was $100 and the doll the contestants were imitating.  Losers receive doll-sized ''Late Night'' T-shirts.

=====Darts of Insanity=====
A series of stunts, each with an associated point value, cycles rapid-fire on the "Dartboard of Insanity" (the Sharp 108).  Three audience members singularly shoot a [[Nerf]] dart gun at the Dartboard, stopping the cycle on a particular stunt.  Whichever contestant completes the stunt with the highest point value is declared the winner.  All three contestants receive $100 and either a T-shirt or a "[[beer koozie]] sweatshirt" (a sweatshirt with a pocket for a beer bottle on the front), although only the winner receives his $100 in the form of a giant check.

Only a few of the "available" games are ever played.  Some of the games are highlighted by Jimmy before the game; some are named and also described – these are usually over the top.  Still others only ever appear in the rotation.  The last game to be played is always "Dude Spoon".  (Some contestants land on "Dude Spoon," but are given the option to spin again; they then land on "Double Dude Spoon", where they have to spoon with two dudes instead of just one.)  The point value of games can vary from episode to episode.

Available games include:

''In the rotation only'': Beat Your Meat (3 points), Believe it or Snot (6 points), Bride of Spanxenstein (5/6 points), Emission Possible (3 points), Fish Sandwich (3 points), Germs of Endearment (6 points), Hog-Tied and Lovin' It!

=====Wax On, Wax Off=====
Two audience members compete, at least one male.  One of the contestants tries to answer trivia questions; each correct answer earns the team $100, but for each incorrect answer, the non-answerer has a portion of his chest hair removed with [[waxing|hot wax]].  Unfortunately, all of the questions are in obscure ''[[Jeopardy!]]''-like categories such as "[[Latvia]]n [[Prime Minister]]s", "13th-Century [[South America]]n Architecture", and "Much Ado About '[[Quantum Mechanics]]'" ("you'll notice 'quantum mechanics' is in quotes", says Jimmy).  The last regular question is played in the "double trouble" format, where two portions of hair are at stake.  The question is usually in the category "Numbers", and the question is usually "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 1000 – what is it?"  (After the contestant gives his guess, Jimmy offers him the chance to change his guess.  After doing so, Jimmy reveals the correct number was actually their first guess.)  The "lightning round" features categories flashing by quickly, with easy categories like music, TV, and movies being skipped over for another difficult category at the end.  As a consolation prize, the contestants are given "Ed Zeppelin" T-shirts (also a prize in the "Wheel of Game Shows" game) and a 24-pack of Nad's body hair removal strips. To date, no one has answered a single question correctly.

The person being waxed in the installment that aired May 15, 2011, was [[New York Jets]] [[center (American football)|center]] [[Nick Mangold]].

=====Wheel of Game Shows=====
Another surreal game in the spirit of "Wheel of Carpet Samples".  Three audience members play mini-games selected by pressing the "game pud" (a buzzer) as the options rotate on the Sharp 108 (similar to the game show ''[[Press Your Luck]]'').  If a player lands on a picture of actor [[Steve Guttenberg]], however, they lose their turn and owe the show $75 (similar to ''Press Your Luck''{{'s}} "Whammy").  To this end, Jimmy urges the contestants to shout "No Guttenbergs!" as the monitor rotates.

Games available include: "Animal Farm", "Brownie Points", "Dance Dance Dance", "Drawing Board", "Find the Red Tissue", "Grab the Cupcake", "Grocery List", "Guess the Card", "Hands in Your Pants", "''[[Harry Potter]]'' Trivia vs. the Roots", "Heads or Tails?", "Hide the Shoe", "''[[iCarly]]'' Trivia vs. the Roots", "Jellybean Jar", "Magnet Scramble", "Number Jumbler", "Number Scramble", "Picture Puzzle", "Remember That Episode of ''[[Full House]]''", "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Nuclear Warhead", "Snap Judgment", "Tarantula Bonanza", "True or False", "Wet Nap Face Slap", "What's In The Box?", "What's the Difference?", "Where Did You Get That Shirt?", "Word of the Day", "Yes or No", and "You Can't Possibly Win!".

After all contestants inevitably tie at zero points since Jimmy doesn't tell them how to play the games, even after a "tiebreaker" (such as "Brownie Points", "Shut Your Pie Hole", or "Egg On Your Face"), they all receive copies of the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' board game (with three pieces missing) and [[Led Zeppelin]] T-shirts where the first "L" has fallen off so that they read "Ed Zeppelin".  (Later installments of the game substitute a copy of Jimmy's CD ''[[Blow Your Pants Off]]'' for the ''SNL'' board game.)

=====Put It On a Cracker=====
Two audience members compete.  Each is blindfolded and fed a cracker with three different foods on top (such as [[pepperoni]], peanut butter, and [[Swedish fish]]).  They must try to name as many of the ingredients as they can.  The winner receives a $300 gift certificate to [[Whole Foods Market|Whole Foods]], while the loser gets to interact with a celebrity impersonator (such as [[Abraham Lincoln]] or young [[Santa Claus]]) (and is also given a $150 gift certificate to Whole Foods).

=====Ready Set Flow=====
Three audience members compete.  They are each given three nouns (an object, a place, and a name - e.g. [[Barbie|Barbie Doll]], [[France]], and [[Charlie Sheen]]) they must work into a 30-second freestyle rap.  The nouns are generated by "Rhyme Wave", a "robot" (played by Tariq Trotter) with a computerized voice that appears on the Sharp 108.  The winner is determined by audience applause.  The winner receives a [[TASCAM]] [[portastudio|pocket studio digital recorder]], while the runners-up receive ''Late Night'' T-shirts, notepads, and pens to write down their own raps.

=====Sing It Like You Mean It=====
Two audience members compete.  Each is played a new song by the Roots that they must memorize and then immediately perform.  The contestant that has yet to play is placed beneath a large blue sensory-deprivation "dome of silence".  The winner is determined by audience applause, who is given a $100 bill and a burned CD with their song rendition on it, while the loser receives a ''Late Night'' T-shirt.

=====Tell Us What You Know=====
Three audience members compete.  Each is given a topic by Jimmy and is given 10 seconds to give as many words as possible relating to that topic.  After time is up, they are given a score by the "Brainmaster" (Mike Dicenzo, wearing a brown robe, turban, and a large, light-up brain).  The winner is given a special prize in an ornate wooden chest (selected by the Brainmaster).  The two losers receive cans of [[Turtle Wax]].  (The winner's prize, coincidentally, is also Turtle Wax.)  (In one playing, the contestants received giftcards to [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], and the winner also received a bag of potato chips autographed by [[Tony Danza]].)

=====Sounds… Good?=====
Three audience members compete.  They are each given a song to sing karaoke-style – with the catch that they will be wearing noise-canceling headphones so they cannot hear themselves sing.  Also, cowboy DJ Munson Rawlings (Gerard Bradford) will be manipulating the pitch of the song, which they must match.  The winner is determined by audience applause, who wins a pair of noise-canceling headphones, while the losers receive ''Late Night'' hoodies.

=====Do the Blank=====
On May 15, 2013, Jimmy invented a new game. Two audience members, a young man and a young woman, were invited to the stage for a dancing competition. Jimmy placed them on either side of a small barrier (so that they could not see each other), then he called out the names of made-up dances which they performed for a few moments, while the Roots played music. The dances Jimmy announced were "The Bro-Bot," "The Freaky Frog," "The Elevator," "The Disco Dentist," "Hand Dancin'," "The Sexy Sway," and "The Flying Tornado." To choose a winner, Jimmy proposed a "Blank-Off" and pressed the "Button of Boogie." A prepared slot machine gave each contestant three "random" words for a final dance: the young woman was given "Pogo Stick Paperboy" and the young man received "The Glowing Thong." The contestants performed their interpretations of these last dances, as before, and then received prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/blogs/2013/05/do-the-blank/ |author= ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon: The Blog'' |date= May 15, 2013 |title= Do the Blank |publisher= ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'' |accessdate= May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other sketches===

====Shared Experience====
Introduced in the third week of the show, this segment consists of the audience and show members participating in an experience together. In the first show, these experiences were to eat a Warhead sour candy, wear a [[Sleeved blanket|Snuggy]], and make a bird call.  Other "Shared Experiences" have involved playing with an inflated beach ball and shooting [[Nerf]] guns at [[A.D. Miles]] while he quietly played [[Jenga]] by himself.

====President of the Audience====
During the show's first week, on March 5, 2009, Jimmy picked three random audience members and elected one of them to be president of the audience for the night. Later that night, [[MSNBC]] host [[Rachel Maddow]] appeared in a breaking news segment and reported that his [[approval ratings]] were dropping. [[Attack ad]]s from his opponent were also shown, accusing the president of being a [[flip flopper]] when it came to liking Jimmy's jokes. The old president was later "impeached" on April 17, 2009, and a new president was appointed.
On March 10, 2010, after Jimmy complained that neither of the previous presidents ever showed up to work, he "elected" a new president by picking one audience member at random.  Jimmy gave the new president a "presidential starter kit", including a copy of the ''Late Night'' by-laws, a quill pen, a carton of cigarettes, a stapler, and a [[first lady]] with "shapely arms".  After an attack ad on behalf of another audience member, ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' weekend anchor [[Lester Holt]] gave a news report about the president's short term thus far.

====Beef Solvers====
A recurring sketch in which audience members are called upon to stand in for celebrities who are having public feuds and come to a mutual understanding.  Segments have included two men as [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]], two white women as [[50 Cent]] and [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]], [[Perez Hilton]] and [[Carrie Prejean]], [[Adam Lambert]] and [[Clay Aiken]], and [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Keith Olbermann]]. One sketch involved four audience members reenacting the feud between [[Paula Abdul]], [[Randy Jackson]], [[Simon Cowell]], and [[Ryan Seacrest]] regarding the new contract offered to Mr. Seacrest as the host of ''[[American Idol]]'' and the fact that she wasn't made a similar offer by the show's producers (she would eventually announce that she was not returning to the show).

====Freestylin' with The Roots====
Jimmy asks audience members random questions.  House band [[The Roots]] then makes up a song about them on the spot using that information in a music style of Jimmy's choosing (reggae, '80s pop, doo-wop, etc.).  When [[Ringo Starr]] was a guest on the show, there was an all-[[The Beatles|Beatles]] version; during "[[Rolling Stones]] Week", there was an all-Stones version.  While the show was in Indianapolis for [[Super Bowl XLVI]], the Roots were joined in freestylin' by the [[Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra]].

On the September 11, 2012 episode, one of the audience members selected was [[Andy Murray]]; The Roots did a song about him winning the [[2012 US Open (tennis)|2012 US Open]] in the style of Scottish band [[The Proclaimers]].  On the October 2, 2012 episode, [[Alec Baldwin]] was selected; his song was about the seventh and final season premiere of ''[[30 Rock]]''.

====What's on Your Facebook page?====
The camera isolates on random audience members and a [[Facebook]] status for them appears which says an intimate personal thought about them.

====What's on Your Playlist?====
Same aspect of ''What's on Your Facebook?'', the camera isolates on random audience members and a graphic of an [[iPod]] appears showing what songs the person has on theirs, which is usually something extremely personal or obscene.

====Think About It====
Three audience members are hooked up to the "Think-O-Sync-ometer" (a box with a red button, later renamed the "[[Intel Corporation|Intel]] Think-O-Sync-ometer 8500") by wearing a "wireless Think-O-Read-ometer headband" (an elastic headband with a suction cup), making sure that the "cerebral cortex nipple" is facing out.  They are then asked to concentrate for 15 seconds on a particular subject provided by Jimmy.  Then, after pressing the button on the Think-O-Sync-ometer, Jimmy "pokes" each contestant's cerebral cortex nipple, allowing the Think-O-Sync-ometer to "project" the audience member's thoughts.

====Audience Voicemails====
Jimmy selects members of the audience and puts their cellphones into the "Hacker 9000" (which Jimmy claims is top-secret technology that only he and [[Rupert Murdoch]] [[News International phone hacking scandal|know about]]), which scans the phone and plays the last received voicemail, which is usually something embarrassing (like a bookstore calling to let them know the [[Justin Bieber]] books they ordered have come in, or a gay strip club offering a man a job, or a man's college roommate reminiscing about drunken pranks).

====Audience Artwork====
Jimmy provides the audience with paper and packs of markers and asks them to draw whatever they want.  He then goes into the audience and reads off some audience members' names and has them show off their drawings.

====''Late Night'' Perm Week====
Every night during the week of February 7 to 11, 2011, the ''Late Night'' crew choose one male audience member with straight hair and gave him a [[perm (hairstyle)|perm]]. He was interviewed with friends before the procedure, then the perm was revealed during the show. Jimmy wore a perm wig during the sketches.
''Late Night'' Perm Week returned May 21 to 25, 2012, as well as July 15 to 19, 2013.

====My Kids Are Weird====
Jimmy showcases children with weird talents like reciting 86 digits of [[pi|π]] or contorting their body into the shape of a [[pretzel]] while eating a soft pretzel.  Jimmy then gives each child a [[aloha shirt|Hawaiian shirt]] and a [[metal detector]] (an homage to his own childhood pastime of searching for buried treasure in his backyard).

====''Audience Got Talent''====
An homage to ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', Jimmy selects members of the audience and has them demonstrate a talent or perform a trick.

==Recurring segments featuring celebrity guests==

===Beer Pong===
Jimmy plays the popular drinking game [[beer pong]] with a celebrity guest, including [[Serena Williams]], [[Ivanka Trump]], [[Betty White]], and [[John McEnroe]].  They play the paddle-less version ("Beirut").  The first player to sink two balls wins (increased to three balls when Jimmy played McEnroe).  When Jimmy played [[Kathie Lee Gifford]], they played the "classier" version "wine pong" using glasses filled with [[chardonnay]].  When Jimmy played [[Gina Gershon]], they drank [[tequila]] shots instead of beer.  When Jimmy played with [[Mariah Carey]], they played "champagne pong" using glasses filled with [[Dom Pérignon (wine)|Dom Pérignon]] [[rosé]].

===Beer Shuffleboard===
In a light-hearted attempt to reclaim the honor of his ''[[The Proposal (2009 film)|The Proposal]]'' co-star Betty White, who at the time was the only celebrity Jimmy had defeated in beer pong, [[Ryan Reynolds]] played Jimmy in a game of beer [[shuffleboard]].  The two later played another game after a dispute arose over an interpretation of the rules of the game.

===''Saved by the Bell'' / ''California Dreams'' Reunion===
On the March 27, 2009 episode, Fallon explained that he had watched an episode of ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'' that morning. The episode he watched was ''The Prom'', where Kelly opted to give the money she had saved to go to the prom with Zack to her father, who had just lost his job. Fallon commented on the absurdity of Kelly's father losing his job at a weapons plant because "world peace had broken out", and also pointed out that the year 2009 is the twentieth anniversary of ''Saved by the Bell''.  Fallon then decided to launch a campaign to persuade the original cast of ''Saved by the Bell'' to appear in a reunion special on his show. [[Dennis Haskins]], who portrayed [[Mr. Belding]], was the first to agree to take part in the reunion, and appeared on the show the same night Fallon launched the campaign. On April 3, 2009, it was announced that [[Lark Voorhees]], who portrayed [[Lisa Turtle]], would also be joining the reunion, making her the second ''Saved by the Bell'' guest. On April 24, 2009, [[Mario Lopez]] appeared on the show. After helping Fallon re-enact almost verbatim the climactic scene of the episode ''Save the Max'' in which the ''Saved by the Bell'' gang put together a pledge-drive to save The Max (altered to ''Late Night'' putting on a pledge drive to reunite the ''Saved by the Bell'' cast), he agreed to appear on the reunion.

On June 8, 2009, [[Mark Paul Gosselaar]] appeared on the show as a guest to promote his series ''[[Raising the Bar (2008 TV series)|Raising the Bar]]''. When he came out on stage, he was dressed as his ''Saved by the Bell'' character [[Zack Morris]] and claimed that since graduating college, he had been living in [[Los Angeles]], working as an actor named Mark Paul Gosselaar because "there was already a Zack Morris in [[Screen Actors Guild|SAG]]". After agreeing to appear on the reunion, he received a phone call, on his signature oversized early-1990s–era cell phone, from [[Jessie Spano]]; Gosselaar then informed Fallon that [[Elizabeth Berkley]] had also agreed to appear on the reunion. At the end of his appearance, Gosselaar sang ''Friends Forever'', a song performed by the ''Saved by the Bell'' gang's band ''Zack Attack''. Fallon and The Roots also performed with him.

On March 4, 2010, Fallon said "it looks like the dream [of a reunion for ''Saved by the Bell''] is over."  However, on that night's show, he reunited the cast of the show ''[[California Dreams]]'' (which aired "right after ''Saved by the Bell''" on NBC) instead.  [[Dennis Haskins]] made a brief appearance, confusing the two reunions.  ''California Dreams'' cast members [[Brent Gore]] (Matt Garrison), [[William James Jones]] (Tony Wicks), [[Heidi Noelle Lenhart]] (Jenny Garrison), [[Kelly Packard]] (Tiffani Smith), [[Jay Anthony Franke]] (Anthony Sommers), [[Jennie Kwan]] (Sam Wu), and [[Michael Cade]] (Sly Winkle) briefly discussed what they're doing now: Gore is working with a non-profit in Los Angeles, Jones is attending [[Pepperdine University]] in pursuit of a master's degree in clinical psychology, Lenhart is a mother of two, Packard is a mother of three and had a small part in the then-upcoming film ''My Girlfriend's Boyfriend'', Franke is living in Australia with his wife and had recently finished filming a television pilot he created himself, Kwan (who became tongue-tied and blushed after being introduced) had toured with the traveling production of the musical ''[[Avenue Q]]'' and did a lot of voice acting (including the character Suki from the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] animated series ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''), and Cade works with the company Oxcyon and had a couple of films coming out that summer.  The seven cast members then played the ''California Dreams'' theme song as the show went to commercial.

In February 2015, the ''Saved by the Bell'' cast was finally reunited (excluding [[Dustin Diamond]] and [[Lark Voorhies]]) and reprised their roles for a sketch which had Jimmy as a new student at Bayside High, and revealed Zack Morris had impregnated Kelly Kapowski ([[Tiffani Thiessen]]  is pregnant in real life).

===Random Object Three-Point Shootout===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest take turns trying to make three-point shots on a [[basketball]] goal using objects like a telephone or a bowl of [[General Mills monster-themed breakfast cereals|Count Chocula]] cereal.

===Tonight Show Celebrity Photobomb===
Jimmy and a celebrity surprise people at the Top of the Rock by photobombing their pictures.

===Charades===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest each pair with an audience member to play [[charades]].  Jimmy has played with [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Amy Poehler]], and teamed up with Poehler to take on the then-husband/wife team of [[Fred Armisen]] and [[Elisabeth Moss]].  He also teamed up with his former ''[[Saturday Night Live|SNL]] [[Weekend Update]]'' partner [[Tina Fey]] to play against their successors as ''Weekend Update'' anchors, [[Amy Poehler]] and [[Seth Meyers]].  Jimmy teamed up with [[Real Housewives of Atlanta#Linnethia "Nene" Leakes|Nene Leakes]] to take on the team of [[Donald Trump]] and [[Lil Jon]] after Trump announced Leakes and Lil Jon as cast members for ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 11)|The Celebrity Apprentice]]'' on that night's episode.  Sometimes Jimmy and [[Steve Higgins]] will each pair with a celebrity to play ([[Black Thought|Tariq Trotter from The Roots]] sometimes also plays if only one other celebrity is playing).

===Celebrity===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest each pair with a member of the audience and play a game of [[Celebrity (game)|Celebrity]].  The game is played in three rounds, each using 16 possible celebrity names as answers.  During the first round, the clue-giver can give as much of a clue as they want.  During the second round, the same set of names is used, but the clues are limited to three words.  During the third and final round, the same names are used again, but the clue-givers may only use gestures (like in [[charades]]).

===Pictionary===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest each pair with an audience member, or with two other celebrities, to play a version of the board game [[Pictionary]]. Guest players have included [[Tina Fey]] (October, 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/video/pictionary-with-tina-fey-part-1/n27593/ |author= ''Late Night With Jimmy Fallon" |date= October 2012 |title= Pictionary with Tina Fey, Part 1 |publisher= ''Late Night With Jimmy Fallon'' |accessdate= October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Melissa McCarthy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/video/pictionary-with-melissa-mccarthy/n34746/ |author= Fallon, Jimmy |date= October 2012 |title= Pictionary with Melissa McCarthy |publisher= ''Late Night With Jimmy Fallon'' |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[CeeLo Green]], [[Katie Couric]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/video/pictionary-with-katie-couric/n33850/ |author= Fallon, Jimmy |date= March 14, 2013 |title= Pictionary with Katie Couric |publisher= ''Late Night With Jimmy Fallon'' |accessdate= October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others.

==Say That to My Face Challenge==
Jimmy and a partner battle a celebrity guest and their partner in a game where each player takes turns doing impressions as clues to get their partners to guess mystery celebrity masks each other is holding up.

===''Space Train''===
While Jimmy is interviewing an actor, he casually mentions a mid-90s action film they were both in called ''Space Train'' (about people who have to save the Earth by going to outer space, but are afraid to fly, so they take a train into space). After the actor claims not to remember the movie, Jimmy shows a "clip" from the movie (acted out live by the two of them).  Participating actors include [[Robert De Niro]] (on the show's first episode), [[Anna Faris]], [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Will Arnett]], and [[Richard Branson|Sir Richard Branson]].

===''The Sibling-wed Game''===
When ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' writer/actor [[Seth Meyers]] appears as a guest, Jimmy will sometimes bring out Meyers' younger brother [[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh]] and have them play a version of ''[[The Newlywed Game]]''. Jimmy asks Seth a series of questions while Josh wears a pair of noise-canceling headphones, and then gets Josh to guess what Seth gave for answers. The brothers then switch positions, with Josh answering and Seth guessing.

===Party Monkey Tic-Tac-Toe===
Jimmy plays a game of [[tic-tac-toe]] with a celebrity guest that has them flinging slingshot "party monkeys" into buckets.

===Water War===
Jimmy plays a game of [[war (card game)|war]] with a celebrity in which the winner of each hand throws a glass of water on the loser. After one player uses five glasses, they earn the right to spray his opponent with a large water gun.  He has played with [[Jason Statham]], [[Christopher Meloni]], [[Chris Kattan]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Jon Hamm]], [[Tom Cruise]], [[Ryan Reynolds]], and [[Lindsay Lohan]], among others.

===Sticky Balls===
Jimmy and a male guest each don a suit made of [[Velcro]] and throw small red balls at their opponent, trying to get the balls to stick to the suit.  After 45 seconds, the balls are tallied and whichever person got more balls on their opponent's suit is declared the winner.

===The ''Late Night'' Invitational===
Jimmy plays a round of miniature golf in the studio and in the halls around the studio with a celebrity. To date, he has played with [[Billy Crudup]], [[Will Arnett]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], and [[Chris Rock]].

===Total Iceholes===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest play an ice-fishing themed game of [[cornhole]] with beanbags shaped like fish and an ice-blue target platform.  Three points are scored for a bag that goes in the hole, and 1 point for each bag remaining on the board at the end of the game.  Each player has 5 bags to throw.

===The Instrument Game===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest alternate playing simple songs (such as "[[She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain]]" or "[[Jingle Bells]]") on a randomly selected musical instrument that neither have any experience playing, trying to get The Roots to correctly guess what they were trying to play.  If there are two celebrity guests, they will compete against each other.  Originally, Jimmy and the celebrity would try to guess the songs each other played.

[[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Carrie Brownstein]] and [[Fred Armisen]] have also played it.

===Let Us Play With Your Look===
A sketch where Jimmy and a celebrity partner give a "makeover" to an audience member.  Both Jimmy and the partner dress all in white, including blonde short-bobbed wigs, with Jimmy wearing a peasant shirt and tights.  Jimmy sings "let us play with your look" over and over, rising in pitch until he gives out, while his partner makes over the audience member.  The celebrity is the first guest later, and both Jimmy and the guest usually express wonder at who those two weird people were.  
*[[Will Ferrell]] messily brushed an audience member's hair
*[[Alec Baldwin]] powdered an audience member's face
*[[Zach Galifianakis]] smeared a great deal of [[hair mousse|mousse]] into an audience member's hair

*[[Don Cheadle]] emptied a can of mousse onto an audience member's head and then disappeared underneath Jimmy's desk
*[[Anne Hathaway]] spritzed water on an audience member's hair and combed it, and eventually just dumped the rest of the water on him; she then backed up and tumbled through the window behind Jimmy's desk
*[[Lindsay Lohan]] massaged shaving cream into an audience member's hair; Jimmy was dragged behind the curtain after giving out, and Lohan awkwardly hid in the folds of the curtain before eventually finding the part in the curtain.  She did not appear later as a normal guest on the show.
*[[Bryan Cranston]] massaged large amounts of differently colored hair gels into an audience member's hair; afterwards, he put the lid of the mousse container over the audience member's head and then sashayed over to kiss Higgins on his way out

===''Other Voices''===
Jimmy plays a clip from ''Other Voices'', a Canadian talk show airing at 3 AM he hosted, which featured his celebrity guest.  Their dialogue is supplied off-screen and they must attempt to lip-sync along to it.  The first installment featured Jimmy interviewing [[Steve Carell]]; Jimmy's dialogue was supplied by Higgins and Carell's was supplied by [[Chris Kattan]].  Later, when Jimmy interviewed [[Simon Cowell]] and [[Queen Latifah]], Higgins and [[A. D. Miles]] supplied the dialogue.  When [[Drew Carey]] appeared as a guest, in addition to Higgins and Miles providing their voices, Jimmy and Drew had people hiding behind them providing their arms. These are both sketches from ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (U.S. TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', the American version of which Carey hosted.

===''Ew!''===
Jimmy and a female guest (or a male in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]]) star in a fictional [[TeenNick]] show called ''Ew!'', shot in the basement of Sara's house, where two teenage girls talk about things that make them say "Ew!". Jimmy plays Sara ("And if you're wondering, that's S-A-R-A, with no H, because H's are ew!"). Her nerdy stepdad Gary (played by [[A. D. Miles]]), whom she hates and is embarrassed by, always interrupts midway through the show.

The character of Sara is based on an actual girl named Sara in Jimmy's audience who loudly said "Ew!" after a disgusting joke during the July 15, 2011, edition of "Thank-You Notes". When Jimmy asked the girl her name, she answered, "Sara without an H."

Jimmy saying Ew! in the style of Sara whenever something disgusting is mentioned during the regular show has also become a [[running gag]].

===="The Ew! Show" guests====
In chronological order, the show has featured the following celebrities as Sara's friends for guests:
*[[Emma Stone]] played her friend Megan.
*[[Claire Danes]] played her friend Katie.
*[[Channing Tatum]] played her friend Susie.
*[[Michael Strahan]] played her friend Kelly.
*[[Lindsay Lohan]] as her friend Stephanie. 
*On April 9, 2013, Sara went backstage at ''The Tonight Show'' to meet the [[Jonas Brothers]], who played themselves (Sara is  their number-one fan). After accidentally signing her poster over their faces, Sara was distraught and could be consoled only with a kiss from the Jonases. Before she could get her kiss, though, they were interrupted by Gary.
*[[Seth Rogen]] played her friend Allison and [[Zac Efron]] played her friend Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon|title="Ew!" with Seth Rogen and Zac Efron|date=2014-05-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_DR9-_QUx4|accessdate=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Taylor Swift]] as Natalie. 
*On October 6, 2014, a song "[[Ew!]]" based on the sketch premiered on the show featuring [[will.i.am]] as Mir.i.am. 
*[[Ariana Grande]] played her friend Alexa Armstrong, a girl who can sing well and prefers grande lattes.
*[[Michelle Obama]] appeared as herself to promote her healthy eating program and brought Sara some kale, who enjoyed it without saying Ew! first.
*[[Miley Cyrus]] played her friend Becky.
*[[Jennifer Lopez]] played her friend Gabby.
*[[Demi Lovato]] played her friend Emily.
*[[John Cena]] played her friend Addison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon|title="Ew!" with John Cena|date=2018-03-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGl-1nwahCA|accessdate=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Britney Spears]] played her friend Abby.

====Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon cameo====
As part of the pre-show video guests watch prior to riding [[Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon]] at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando]], [[Florida]], Jimmy appears as his real self introducing the ride's theme and safety procedures (which Tariq of the Roots raps to), only to discover Sara and Gary in the audience.  When Sara interrupts Jimmy telling him to get the ride started, she introduces herself and Gary, using her catchphrase.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epjUVaFuse0&lt;/ref&gt;  Jimmy comments that they aren't supposed to be there yet because the rest of the audience is still outside.  Sara then remarks, "Ew!  Let's get out of here!  Gary, take me to the gift shop!", and the pair leave.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epjUVaFuse0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tight Pants===
On May 10, 2012, [[Will Ferrell]] hosted. He emerged from the curtains dancing and singing about his white "tight pants". In this sketch that was the most popular among fans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gothamist.com/2012/05/11/video_will_ferrells_hilariously_sil.php |author= Yakas, Ben |date= May 11, 2012 |title= Watch Will Ferrell's Hilariously Silly "Tight Pants" Song On Fallon |publisher= [[Gothamist]] |accessdate= February 2, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160222012515/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/11/video_will_ferrells_hilariously_sil.php |archivedate= February 22, 2016 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://splitsider.com/2014/01/8-great-sketches-from-late-night-with-jimmy-fallon/ |author= Wright, Megh |date= January 6, 2014 |title= 8 Great Sketches from 5 Years of 'Late Night with Jimmy Fallon' |publisher= [[The Awl|Splitsider]] |accessdate= February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thecelebritycafe.com/feature/2014/01/top-10-funniest-moments-best-late-night-jimmy-fallon?page=2 |author= Gullickson, Hannah |date= January 9, 2014 |title= Top 10 Funniest Moments on 'The Best of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon' |publisher= Celebrity Cafe |accessdate= February 2, 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140115165052/http://thecelebritycafe.com/feature/2014/01/top-10-funniest-moments-best-late-night-jimmy-fallon?page=2 |archivedate= January 15, 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/02/10-best-late-night-with-jimmy-fallon-sketches.html |author= Sharp, Stephanie |date= February 20, 2013 |title= The 10 Best Late Night With Jimmy Fallon Sketches |publisher= ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' |accessdate= February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "All of a sudden, Fallon crashed the party with his own tight pants, which did not sit well with Ferrell — who claimed he was the only one who could wear tight pants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.mediaite.com/tv/watch-will-ferrell-and-jimmy-fallon-sing-about-their-tight-pants/ |author= Crugnale, James |date= May 11, 2012 |title= Watch Will Ferrell And Jimmy Fallon Sing About Their 'Tight Pants' |publisher= [[Mediaite]] |accessdate= February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skit was re-run on Fallon's ''Best of Late Night'' special (2014). Later, on Fallon's Tonight Show, he revived the sketch with [[Jennifer Lopez]]. In 2016, it was reprised with [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Christina Aguilera]].

In all renditions, Fallon always leaves and says he'll find a new town.

===Shazazz===
Whenever [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] is on, Jimmy mentions they were in a singing duo named Shazazz several years ago (either in the late 1980s or early 1990s). They go on to perform their top hits, originally in the style of [[old school rap]]: "Do It", "We're Gonna Do It", and "Remember When We Did It (The Reunion)".  A later version had them switching genres to R&amp;B and performing "Let's Do It", "Why Don't We Do It Again", and "We Did It".

===Pleather and Lace===
Jimmy reminisced with [[Liv Tyler]] about the time they appeared on ''[[Star Search]]'' in the 80s as the duo "Pleather and Lace", singing a cover of [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s "[[All Through the Night (Cyndi Lauper song)|All Through the Night]]".  (The Star Search judges gave them ¼ stars.)

Later, the duo appeared on the (fictional) talent search show ''Star Makerz'' singing [[The Human League]]'s "[[Don't You Want Me]]".  The Star Makerz judges gave them ¼ Zs.

===''Password''===
After showing a brief clip of the original black-and-white ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'' from the 1960s (originally hosted by [[Allen Ludden]], [[Betty White]]'s husband), Jimmy played Betty (along with two audience members) in a game of ''Password'' hosted by [[Steve Higgins|Higgins]] on a recreation of the original ''Password'' set.  Jimmy later teamed up with [[Robert De Niro]] to play against [[Bradley Cooper]] and an audience member.

Several more games of ''Password'' have occurred since then.

===''Pyramid''===
Higgins emcees a version of the classic game show ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'' where Jimmy and a celebrity guest each pair with an audience member.

===Catch Phrase===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest each pair with an audience member and play a game of [[Catch Phrase (game)|Catch Phrase]].  The first pair to two points wins.

===Mixology with Rachel Maddow===
Whenever she is a guest on the show, [[Rachel Maddow]], a self-proclaimed mixologist, makes Jimmy an obscure [[cocktail]].

===Hockey with Denis Leary===
When he is a guest on the show, [[Denis Leary]] and Jimmy will usually play each other in a hockey-themed game, such as [[air hockey]] or "box hockey".  They usually make a bet that the loser will donate money to the [[Cam Neely]] House for cancer patients in Boston.

===Audience Skee Ball===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest take turns rolling large, soft balls up a ramp into the audience, where audience members are holding bins and buckets labeled with different point values in a layout reminiscent of that used in a regular [[skee ball]] game.

===The Long Pour===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest attempt to pour three bottles of beer, one at a time, first into a mug and then from the mug into a large [[graduated cylinder]].  The pouring is complicated by a broomstick, both ends of which is affixed to their wrists, so that their arms are completely outstretched when attempting the pour from the bottle to the mug.  The person with the most liquid in the cylinder at the end of the game wins.

===Bow and Arrow Stand-Off===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest each wear a clear plastic box around the upper half of their bodies.  The box is divided into three zones: head, torso, and groin.  Both of them are armed with a Nerf-style bow and suction-cup arrows.  They stand approximately 15 feet apart and try to hit each other with the arrows.  Five points are awarded for an arrow to the torso, ten for a head shot, and twenty for a hit in the groin area.

===Home Run Derby===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest each hit large foam balls off a tee into the audience using a large plastic bat.  The audience is divided into three scoring zones.  Each player hits three balls (and sometimes also a final "superball" worth double points).  Where the ball lands in the audience is how much it's worth.  When playing against a British guest, they use [[cricket]] bats instead.

===Rock, Paper, Scissors, Pie===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest each put their arms and head through holes in stand-up pictures of chefs.  In front of them is a pie-flinging machine.  They then play rounds of rock-paper-scissors.  Each time one of them loses a round, they click their machine one time.  After a random number of clicks, the machine will propel the pie into their face (similar in concept to [[Russian roulette]]).  The first person to take three (later reduced to two) pies to the face loses. One such guest was [[Glenn Close]] on June 5, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/video/rock-paper-scissors-pie-with-glenn-close/n37670/ |author= Fallon, Jimmy |date= June 5, 2013 |title= Rock, Paper, Scissors, Pie with Glenn Close [video] |publisher= ''Late Night With Jimmy Fallon'' |accessdate= October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''True Facts of Truth''===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest appear as disembodied heads in front of a tranquil background and recite not-quite-true facts like "[[George Washington]]'s face appears on the quarter, the one-dollar bill, and [[Tobey Maguire]]'s left butt cheek" while new age music plays in the background.

===Egg Russian Roulette===
Jimmy and a celebrity guest take turns selecting an egg from a carton where 8 of the eggs have been hard-boiled and 4 have been left raw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thedailymeal.com/egg-russian-roulette-best-most-terrifying-game-ever |author= Chou, Jessica |date= Aug 6, 2013 |title= Egg Russian Roulette Is the Best, Most Terrifying Game Ever: Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon spend 5 minutes Smashing Eggs on their Head, and it is Hilarious |publisher= ''The Daily Meal'' |accessdate= October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Jimmy and his guest sit on stools at a small, high table, [[Steve Higgins]] presents the egg carton with humorous but ominous remarks while explaining the rules. The contestants then take turns in choosing an egg from the carton and smash it against his forehead. The first person to smash two raw eggs on his head is the loser.

Guest players have included [[Jason Sudeikis]] (November 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.thecomedybureau.com/post/35213084343/jimmy-fallon-russian-roulette-eggs-sudeikis |last= Madigan |first=Cathleen |date= November 2012 |title= Jimmy Fallon and Jason Sudeikis Play Russian Roulette with Eggs |publisher= The Comedy Bureau |accessdate= October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Duchovny]] (January 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/blogs/2013/01/egg-russian-roulette/ |last= Cockenberg|first=Marina |date= January 12, 2013 |title= Egg Russian Roulette With David Duchovny |publisher= ''Late Night With Jimmy Fallon'' |accessdate= October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joel McHale]] (February 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/blogs/2013/02/egg-russian-roulette-with-joel-mchale/ |last= Friar|first= Christine |date= February 8, 2013 |title= Egg Russian Roulette with Joel McHale |publisher= ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'' |accessdate= October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Cruise]] (April 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tom-cruise-jimmy-fallon-play-438843 |last= Couch|first= Aaron |date= April 12, 2013 |title= Tom Cruise Plays Egg Roulette on 'Fallon' (Video) |publisher= ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' |accessdate= October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://laughingsquid.com/tom-cruise-plays-egg-russian-roulette-on-his-head-on-late-night-with-jimmy-fallon/ |last= Blazenhoff|first= Rusty |date= August 6, 2013 |title= Egg Russian Roulette with Jimmy Fallon |publisher= [[Laughing Squid]] |accessdate= October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seth Meyers]] (August 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://splitsider.com/2013/08/watch-seth-meyers-talk-about-taking-over-late-night-on-jimmy-fallon/ |last= Evans|first= Bradford |date= August 6, 2013 |title= Watch Seth Meyers Talk About Taking Over ''Late Night'' on ''Jimmy Fallon'' |publisher= [[The Awl|Splitsider]] |accessdate= October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edward Norton]] (October 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/blogs/2013/10/egg-russian-roulette-with-edward-norton/ |first=Hannah|last=VanderPoel  |date= October 25, 2013 |title= Egg Russian Roulette with Edward Norton |publisher= ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'' |accessdate= October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Word Sneak===
In Word Sneak, Jimmy &amp; the celebrity guest hold 5 cards, each containing random words that must be said in a conversation as seamlessly &amp; casually as possible. Guests that have played include [[Bryan Cranston]] and [[Ricky Gervais]].

===Yacht Rock===
Once a year on the show, Jimmy has a "yacht rock" party, celebrating that genre of [[soft rock]] of the late 70s and early 80s.  Jimmy will wear a captain's hat (and give out the hats to the audience) and have nautical-themed games.  In addition, a yacht rock act will perform one of their hits of the genre:
* On October 5, 2009, [[Christopher Cross]] and [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]] sang "[[Ride Like the Wind]]".
* On May 21, 2010, [[Robbie Dupree]] sang "[[Steal Away (Robbie Dupree song)|Steal Away]]".

===History of Rap in 3 Minutes===
Whenever [[Justin Timberlake]] appears on the show, he and Jimmy perform a medley of popular hip-hop and rap songs from a 30-year span in (roughly) chronological order. Thus far, they have done six installments.

==One-time sketches involving celebrity guests==

===Thanksgiving===
In this sketch, aired on Nov. 22, 2009, guest [[Blake Lively]] and Jimmy play each other, reminiscing about their previous Thanksgiving Dinners. It is shown through flashbacks that each Thanksgiving both Blake and Jimmy bring the same food item or dish. Blake, enraged, slaps Jimmy.  At the last Thanksgiving shown neither bring out a food dish, however Blake becomes enraged anyway when she and Jimmy break the wishbone from the turkey and he gets the bigger half.

===Pumpkin Bowling===
On Halloween 2011, Jimmy and [[Heidi Klum]] bowled two frames apiece using pumpkins of various sizes instead of bowling balls.  Klum beat Jimmy 19-18.

===Relationship with Stephen Colbert===
After [[Stephen Colbert]] auctioned off a portrait of himself "enhanced" by artists [[Shepard Fairey]] and [[Andres Serrano]] for the charity [[DonorsChoose]], he declared on his show, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', that his "BFF for six months," Jimmy Fallon, was going to match the auction price, $26,000.  On the next night's ''Late Night'', Fallon demurred, saying, "here's the thing: I never said that."  Hearing that, Colbert came out on the ''Late Night'' stage and chided him, saying, "if you can't donate $26,000 of your best friend's money without asking him first, what's the point in being best friends?"  In quasi-retaliation, Fallon announced that if his viewers would donate the $26,000 to DonorsChoose, Colbert would appear with the Roots to sing [[Rebecca Black]]'s "[[Friday (Rebecca Black song)|Friday]]".  (Fallon claimed he couldn't match the amount himself due to his money "being tied up in Soul Patrol Sweatshirts".)  The viewers met the donation goal (as of April 2, 2011, 2,026 donors had pledged $63,902&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jimmy Fallon / Stephen Colbert Project (DonorsChoose.org)|url=http://www.donorschoose.org/fallon-colbert-project|work=DonorsChoose.org|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with [[NBC Universal]] also matching the $26,000, and Colbert, along with Fallon, Black Thought, [[Taylor Hicks]], and the [[New York Knicks]] City Dancers, performed the song on the April 1, 2011 show.  During the performance, [[Seth Herzog]] held up a large placard with a [[QR code]] on it; the code led to a "secret" video where Jimmy thanked his viewers for their donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did you see the QR code during ‘Friday’ with Stephen Colbert?|url=http://www.nofactzone.net/2011/04/02/did-you-see-the-qr-code-during-friday-with-stephen-colbert-this-is-what-it-was-for/|work=No Fact Zone|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later segment of ''The Colbert Report'', Colbert noticed that NBC used a picture of the "Friday" performance in ''Late Night''{{'}}s Emmy packet, and pointed out the irony of doing so since Fallon and Colbert would be up for Emmys in the same category.  Colbert then did a "Thank You Note" to Jimmy for promoting his show. On a later episode of ''Late Night'', Jimmy wanted to remain "fremmymies" (a portmanteau of "friend" and "Emmy") rather than "emmymies" and countered with his version of Colbert's "The Wørd" (which included "Who are we kidding – neither of us is gonna beat [[Jon Stewart]]"); the show then went to commercial with the logo ''Late Night with Jimmy Falbert''.

When the six months was up, the pair became mortal enemies and went on each other's shows to feud. [[Anderson Cooper]] appeared on both sketches (claiming Italian restaurant [[Sbarro]] gives out free tickets to both shows when you buy a slice of pizza) asking each host if he could be their new friend, to which both replied "No, Anderson, it's just too soon!"

===Who's on First?===
On December 20, 2012, Jimmy and Higgins did a version of the classic [[Abbott and Costello]] bit "[[Who's on First?]]" with Jimmy in the Bud Abbott role and Higgins in the Lou Costello role.  During the bit, [[Billy Crystal]] appeared as the first baseman (Who), A. D. Miles was the second baseman (What), and [[Jerry Seinfeld]] played the third baseman (I Don't Know).

===Jimmy and Will Smith's 1920s radio show===
On May 24, 2012, Jimmy and [[Will Smith]] played their grandfathers, who had a music show on the old [[NBC Radio Network]] in the 1920s, and they show some old archived clips of them performing. However, all of the songs they performed were simply crooner-style versions of Smith's old songs, who claims they sound nothing like his music.

===Point Pleasant Police Department===
Jimmy and [[Bill Hader]] played a clip from a TV show in the 1980s they starred in together, in which play officers from the [[Point Pleasant, New Jersey]] Police Department, who repeatedly spit food on each other. Since then he did the skit again with [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Kevin James]].

===Suspended Suspense===

Jimmy and [[Bryan Cranston]] show clips from a soap opera they were in called ''Suspended Suspense'' in which they played brothers fighting over their late father's estate, all while suspended in the air by harnesses.

===Come Dance With Us===
Jimmy and [[Jennifer Lawrence]] show clips from instructional dance videos they attempted to sell on an overnight show on QVC.

===Hello video parody===
Jimmy was joined by [[Lionel Richie]] for a duet of Richie's song "[[Hello (Lionel Richie song)|Hello]]", which was also a parody of its music video.

===In the Dusk of Night===
Jimmy and [[Jon Hamm]] show clips from a soap opera they starred in together called ''In the Dusk of Night'' in which they played business partners fighting about whether or not Hamm's character is having an affair with Jimmy's character's wife. All the while, small animals on remote controlled cars roll onto the set playing loud music. Hamm claimed his outstanding performance was the reason he got the part of [[Don Draper]] on ''[[Mad Men]]''.

===Canyon Confessions===
Jimmy and Bryan Cranston show clips from an action show they were in together in which they played [[BASE jumping|BASE jumpers]] who confessed wrongdoings to each other while on a dive.

==Other sketches==

===March Madness picks===
Each year for [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|March Madness]], Jimmy picks an [[Underdog (competition)|underdog team]] he thinks will go all the way. So far he is 1–3; his first 3 picks lost in the first round, but his 2013 pick actually made the Final Four.

In [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], Jimmy threw all of his support behind the [[Chattanooga Mocs basketball|Tennessee-Chattanooga Mocs]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdef.com/blog/the_mocs_have_a_late_night_booster_in_jimmy_fallon/03/2009 WDEF.com The Mocs Have a Late Night Booster in Jimmy Fallon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322025423/http://www.wdef.com/blog/the_mocs_have_a_late_night_booster_in_jimmy_fallon/03/2009 |date=2009-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who were seeded #16 and played the heavy favorite, #1 seeded [[2008-09 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|Connecticut Huskies]] in the first round. Jimmy made signs for the audience to hold up, gave them T-shirts, had their pep band play on the show, did a brief history of the school, and did an interview via satellite with Head Coach John Shulman. He also reviewed a [[University of Tennessee at Chattanooga#Notable alumni, students, and faculty|list of notable graduates]], which includes [[Dennis Haskins]] (most known as [[Mr. Belding]] from the TV series ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'') who made an appearance on stage in support of his alma mater and gave Jimmy a UTC hat. However, the show's support wasn't enough, as the Mocs lost the game 103–47.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/gamecenter/live/NCAAB_20090319_TNCHAT@CT CBS Sports Game Summary - Round 1 - UTC / UConn]&lt;/ref&gt; Coach Shulman and the outgoing senior players attended the March 20th taping of the show as audience members and Jimmy had a brief conversation with the coach during the show.

In [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010]], Jimmy picked the [[2009–10 Siena Saints men's basketball team|Siena Saints]]. He said he wanted to pick his hometown school. He once again did a school history and reviewed a [[List of notable graduates of Siena college|list of notable graduates]], which also includes his sister Gloria. The Roots then performed a ballad about head coach [[Fran McCaffery]].  The #13 seed Saints lost in the first round to the #4 seed [[2009-10 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|Purdue Boilermakers]] 72–64.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=300782509 Siena vs Purdue Round 1] ''ESPN''&lt;/ref&gt;  As a tribute to the team, Jimmy read off the Siena roster and had the audience twirl Saints T-shirts.

In [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2011]], Jimmy picked the #15 seed [[2010–11 Long Island Blackbirds men's basketball team|Long Island-Brooklyn Blackbirds]] who played the #2 seed [[2010–11 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina Tarheels]] in the first round. To celebrate, Fallon gave the entire audience Long Island-Brooklyn basketball T-shirts. Later, the Roots sang a song about the LIU head coach [[Jim Ferry (basketball)|Jim Ferry]], described by Jimmy as "the sexiest coach in the NCAA", and then Jimmy gave the entire audience Blackbirds [[thundersticks]]. LIU's mascot also appeared during [[#Cell Phone Shootout|Cell Phone Shootout]] the day before the first game to give high fives to the audience. Jimmy's pick once again didn't make it past the first round, losing 102–87.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/gametracker/recap/NCAAB_20110318_LIU@NC No. 2 UNC rolls past a scrappy Long Island team] CBS Sports March 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

''Late Night'' was in reruns the week before the tournament in 2012, so no underdog pick was made that year; however, Jimmy did a [[#Pros and Cons|Pros and Cons]] sketch about March Madness upon his return.

In [[2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2013]], Jimmy's team was the #4 seed [[2012–13 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse Orange]], his first pick to have a higher seed than their first-round opponent.  Jimmy gave a special shout-out to Syracuse sophomore forward [[Rakeem Christmas]] (whom, Jimmy points out, wears number [[Christmas|25]] on his jersey). After Syracuse won their first game (81–34 over the #13-seed [[2012–13 Montana Grizzlies basketball team|Montana Grizzlies]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330800183 Syracuse smothers Montana in lopsided victory] ''ESPN''&lt;/ref&gt;), Jimmy gave one lucky audience member a bowl of oranges, which he elected to trade for a "mystery prize": a sack of oranges.  After Syracuse won their second game (66–60 over the #12-seed [[2012–13 California Golden Bears men's basketball team|California Golden Bears]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330820183 Syracuse survives 12-minute drought without FG to advance to Sweet 16] ''ESPN''&lt;/ref&gt;) Jimmy gave out another bowl of oranges, which was traded for a citrus juicer.  Syracuse's third game was a 61–50 win over the #1-seed [[2012–13 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana Hoosiers]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330870084 Syracuse holds Indiana to season low in points, makes Elite Eight] ''ESPN''&lt;/ref&gt; but fell during a long weekend.  After Syracuse won their fourth game (a 55–39 win over the #3-seed [[2012–13 Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball team|Marquette Golden Eagles]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330890269 Syracuse smothers Marquette with 2-3 zone, reaches Final Four] ''ESPN''&lt;/ref&gt;), Jimmy gave out another bowl of oranges, which were traded for a gift-wrapped bowl of oranges. Jimmy wanted to show a clip from their Elite Eight Victory, but CBS wouldn't allow it, so they re-created one using an [[Atari 2600]] basketball game. Syracuse was finally defeated in the Final Four by Michigan on April 6.

In 2014-2016, the [[#Puppy Predictors|Puppy Predictors]] chose the winners.

In [[2017 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2017]], Jimmy as [[Shaquille O'Neal]] did a bracket (or "Shaq-et") in during Shaq's fictional podcast named "The Shaqcast" in which he picked the winners based on bizarre criteria (i.e. Wisconsin wins because they're the cheese state and he loves cheese) or the better mascot (he chose Gonzaga to win the tournament because Bulldogs are adorable, although his first pick was his alma mater Louisiana State).

===April Fool's Day pranks===
As an [[April Fool's Day]] prank in 2009, [[Yoshi Amao]] came out and did the entire monologue in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (with subtitles) instead of Jimmy.

In 2010, most of the band was shown lounging instead of playing the theme song during the introduction (the music was pre-recorded) while keyboardists [[James Poyser]] and [[Kamal Gray]] had a pretend boxing match.

In 2011, the band briefly played the theme song intentionally poorly and [[Questlove]]'s drumming "stepped on" Tariq's announcing of the episode number.  Shortly thereafter, Questlove announced "April Fools!" They finished the theme song as normal.

In 2012, April 1 fell on a weekend.

===If Puppies Could Vote/Puppy Predictors===
In the run-up to the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], Jimmy had five [[Golden Retriever]] puppies with human first and last names (Roger Blain, Brian Johnson, Kyle McAdams, Lisa Armstrong, and "troublemaker" Gary Frick) act as "pundits" to predict the winner of various races by choosing which of two bowls of dog food to eat from (blue for the Democrat and red for the Republican).  After he briefly went through the candidates' positions, he released the puppies from a small cage. The puppies selected:
*in the [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010|Nevada Senate race]]: [[Harry Reid]], 4-1 over [[Sharron Angle]].
*in the [[United States Senate election in Illinois, 2010|Illinois Senate race]]: [[Mark Kirk]], 3-2 over [[Alexi Giannoulias]].
*in the [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2010|Pennsylvania Senate race]]: [[Joe Sestak]], 3-2 over [[Pat Toomey]].
*in the [[New York gubernatorial election, 2010|New York Governor's race]]: the original call was [[Carl Paladino]] 3-2 over [[Andrew Cuomo]], but a review of the tape revealed one puppy (Gary Frick) had "controversially" [[flip-flop (politics)|flip-flopped]] and changed his vote, giving Cuomo the victory.

The puppies correctly called three of the four races, only missing in the Sestak/Toomey race in Pennsylvania.

After the election, an "attack ad" ("paid for by cats") surfaced slamming Gary Frick for his flip-flop in the Cuomo/Paladino race.

In a final bipartisan effort, he rewarded the puppies for their work by letting them eat out of a single bowl.

Jimmy also had the puppies predict the Best Picture winner of the [[83rd Academy Awards]]. They incorrectly predicted ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (''[[The King's Speech]]'' was the actual winner).

Jimmy later had the puppies predict the results of the 2011 NFL season.  They incorrectly selected the [[New England Patriots]] to be the winners of [[Super Bowl XLVI]]. The Patriots did make it to the Super Bowl, but lost to the [[New York Giants]] by the score of 21-17.

On the February 24, 2012 episode, Jimmy had the puppies predict the Best Picture winner of the [[84th Academy Awards]]. They incorrectly predicted ''[[The Tree of Life (film)|The Tree of Life]]'' (''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' was the actual winner).

The night before the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 U.S. presidential election]], Jimmy allowed Gary Frick (whom Jimmy has adopted as his own pet) to select the winner.  She (Gary Frick is actually a female dog) incorrectly picked [[Mitt Romney]] as the winner ([[Barack Obama]] was re-elected).

On the January 30, 2013 episode, as part of an "Audience Suggestion Box" segment, Jimmy had the puppies predict the winner of [[Super Bowl XLVII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/01/31/jimmy-fallon-super-bowl-puppies/ |author= Fowler, Tara |date= January 31, 2012 |title= Jimmy Fallon Predicts the Super Bowl with Puppies - VIDEO |publisher= ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' |accessdate= March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They correctly selected the [[Baltimore Ravens]] over the [[San Francisco 49ers]] (the final score was 34-31).

On the February 20, 2013 episode, Jimmy had the puppies predict the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] winner of the [[85th Academy Awards]]. They correctly predicted ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]].'' (Gary Frick did not appear in this segment; she was replaced by Barry Frick, whose relation to Gary, if any, is not yet known.)

On April 12, 2013 a puppy incorrectly picked [[2012–13 Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team|Wichita State]] to win the [[2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] (even though the show's pick was [[2012-13 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]], who also didn't win—that honor went to [[2012-13 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]]). The selection method was different for this prediction: each of the four puppies wore the jersey of a different team and the first one that reached the food bowl indicated the prediction.

On May 3, 2013, Jimmy had one puppy (Barry Frick) predict the winner of the [[2013 Kentucky Derby]]. Barry incorrectly predicted Verrazano, who came in 14th place; [[Orb (horse)|Orb]] was the winner.

On September 4, 2013, as part of an "Audience Suggestion Box" segment, Jimmy had the puppies predict the winner of the NFL season opener between the Baltimore Ravens and the [[Denver Broncos]]. They predicted Denver. The puppies were correct when the Broncos, led by [[Peyton Manning]], did win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2013/9/6/4699484/broncos-ravens-2013-results-score-recap |author= Dator, James |date= September 6, 2013 |title= Ravens vs. Broncos 2013 final score: Peyton Manning breaks records in Broncos' victory, 49-27  |publisher= [[SB Nation]] |accessdate= October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 2015, as part of an "Audience Suggestion Box" segment, Jimmy had 16 puppies predict the winner of the [[2015 Kentucky Derby]], all of them representing one of the top sixteen horses racing. The puppies correctly predicted that American Pharaoh would win the derby.

===''Harry Potter'' Super Fan Contest===
Jimmy brought down two self-professed fans of the ''Harry Potter'' series and had them compete at a series of contests to try to win a prize package provided by [[Warner Brothers]].

*Bean Taste Test: Contestants attempt to identify one of [[Bernie Bott's Every Flavor Beans]] ("rotten egg" and "vomit") by taste for one point.
*Guess the Title: Jimmy read the name of on the ''Harry Potter'' films as translated into a foreign language (''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|Harry Potter und die Kammer des Schreckens]]'') that the contestants had to identify for one point.
*Repeat After the Living Painting: Jimmy brought out a "living painting" (Mike Dicenzo) who recited a recipe for Dragon Dung Fertilizer that the contestants had to remember and write down later, earning one point for each correct ingredient.

Because the contestants were tied after round 3, they went to a tiebreaker, where they had to chug a pint of [[butterbeer]] as quickly as possible.

The winner's prize was a three-day trip for two to [[London]], staying at a four-star hotel, and the winner would film a ''Harry Potter'' movie scene.  The loser received a ''Late Night'' T-shirt.

===The Twelve Things of 2010===
Jimmy and a choir of the show's staff sang a song about the twelve biggest news stories of 2010, to the tune of "[[The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)|The Twelve Days of Christmas]]".  The sketch returned in 2011 as the "''Late Night'' Topical Carolers".

===Target Demographic===
In ''Target Demographic'', Jimmy details a very specific type of viewer which is attractive to advertisers due to their excessive wasteful spending on material goods. The first version was "Blonde Connecticut Housewives". The segment has also examined "Jersey Shore [[Douchebaggery|D-Bags]]" (actual residents of the area, not cast members of the MTV reality show), "Indian Doctors", and "Balds". This sketch was only done in the early days of the show and has seemed to be retired.

===University of Oregon Power Ballad===
Leading up to the [[2011 BCS National Championship Game]] between the [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn Tigers]] and the [[2010 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon Ducks]], Jimmy noted that, while most schools have school [[fight song]]s, no school has a school [[power ballad]].  After some deliberation as to which of the championship teams to choose, he decided to create one for Oregon, "We are the Ducks", which was performed by former [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]] lead singer [[Sebastian Bach]].

===Pro Bowl Shuffle===
Jimmy and the show's staff, plus [[Will Arnett]] and [[Horatio Sanz]], did a parody of "[[The Super Bowl Shuffle]]" called "The [[Pro Bowl]] Shuffle".

Jimmy played [[New England Patriots]] quarterback [[Tom Brady]], Arnett played [[Minnesota Vikings]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]], Sanz played [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] strong safety [[Troy Polamalu]], [[Bashir Salahuddin]] played [[Philadelphia Eagles]] quarterback [[Michael Vick]], and [[A.D. Miles]] played [[New York Giants]] quarterback [[Eli Manning]].  In non-speaking roles, [[Owen Biddle (musician)|Owen Biddle]] played [[Dallas Cowboys]] quarterback [[Tony Romo]], [[Questlove]] played [[Detroit Lions]] tackle [[Ndamukong Suh]], Damon Bryson played Eagles wide receiver [[DeSean Jackson]], [[Kamal Gray]] played [[Baltimore Ravens]] linebacker [[Ray Lewis]], with unidentified gentlemen playing Cowboys tight end [[Jason Witten]] and [[Chicago Bears]] defensive end [[Julius Peppers]].

[[Black Thought]] played [[Tennessee Titans]] running back [[Chris Johnson (running back)|Chris Johnson]], [[Captain Kirk Douglas]] played Giants wide receiver [[Steve Smith (American football, born 1985)|Steve Smith]], [[F. Knuckles]] played [[New Orleans Saints]] running back [[Reggie Bush]], with an unidentified gentleman playing [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]], even though those four players were not named to the [[2011 Pro Bowl]] at the time (Johnson later made the Pro Bowl as a replacement for injured [[Houston Texans]] running back [[Arian Foster]]).

===Mad Libs ''Twas the Night Before Christmas''===
Jimmy enlisted the help of [[Zac Efron]], [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Howie Mandel]], [[Jack McBrayer]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Jason Segel]], [[Martin Short]], [[T.I.]], and [[Brian Williams]] to recite a shortened version of the poem ''[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]'' in a [[Mad Libs]] fashion.

{{Quote box|align=center|width=50%|quote='Twas the night before Christmas, when all thro' the house&lt;br&gt;
Not a creature was stirring, not even '''a [[Swiffer]]''' (Mandel);&lt;br&gt;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,&lt;br&gt;
In hopes that '''[[Rod Carew]]''' (Oswalt) soon would be there;&lt;br&gt;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,&lt;br&gt;
While visions of '''sweet and sour shrimp''' (T.I.) danc'd in their heads,&lt;br&gt;
And Mama in her '''performance fleece''' (Eisenberg), and I in my cap,&lt;br&gt;
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's '''crap''' (McBrayer) —&lt;br&gt;
When out on the lawn there arose such a '''''caw''''' (Short),&lt;br&gt;
I sprang from the bed to see '''what it be''' (Williams).&lt;br&gt;
Away to the window I flew like '''a virgin''' (McBrayer),&lt;br&gt;
Tore open the shutters, and threw up '''all over my new loafers''' (Williams).&lt;br&gt;
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,&lt;br&gt;
But a '''[[AMC Gremlin#1971|'71 Gremlin]]''' (Oswalt), and eight '''sexy''' (Segel) '''ferrets''' (T.I.),&lt;br&gt;
With a little old driver, so '''sloppy''' (Efron) and quick,&lt;br&gt;
I knew in a moment it must be '''[[Herbert Hoover]]''' (Rudolph).&lt;br&gt;
More rapid than '''yogurt tubes''' (Oswalt) his coursers they came,&lt;br&gt;
And he '''sneezed''' (Williams), and he '''pooped''' (Rudolph), and call'd them by name:&lt;br&gt;
"Now! Dasher, now! '''Spanky''' (Short), now! '''Gertie''' (McBrayer) and Vixen,&lt;br&gt;
"On! '''Fallopia''' (Rudolph), on! '''[[Charles Barkley]]''' (T.I.), on! '''Mucus Legs''' (Oswalt) and Blitzen;&lt;br&gt;
His eyes — how they twinkled! His '''nipples''' (McBrayer): how merry,&lt;br&gt;
His cheeks were like '''squishy''' (Oswalt) '''birds''' (T.I.), his '''breasts''' (Short) like a cherry;&lt;br&gt;
He had a broad face, and a '''stanky''' (Williams) '''hot''' (Rudolph) belly&lt;br&gt;
That shook when he '''diddled''' (McBrayer), like a bowl full of '''hot sauce''' (T.I.):&lt;br&gt;
And laying his '''weird sucker pads''' (Oswalt) aside of his '''spicy butt''' (Rudolph)&lt;br&gt;
And giving a '''squash''' (Efron), up the '''ding-dong''' (Short) he '''wiped''' (Williams).&lt;br&gt;
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight —&lt;br&gt;
'''Happy''' (Efron) '''Christmas''' (Eisenberg) '''to''' (T.I.) '''all''' (McBrayer), '''and''' (Oswalt) '''to''' (T.I.) '''all''' (Short) '''a''' (Mandel) '''dried penis''' (Rudolph).}}

===2012 Democratic National Convention===
During the week of the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]], Jimmy opened each show with an impression of a speaker from the previous night at the convention: [[San Antonio]] mayor [[Julian Castro]], former president [[Bill Clinton]], and singer [[James Taylor]] (singing a parody of "[[Fire and Rain (song)|Fire and Rain]]" about the DNC and [[2012 Republican National Convention|RNC]]).

===The Evolution of ___ Dancing===
In a parody of the viral video hit [[Evolution of Dance|"The Evolution of Dance"]], Jimmy and First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] performed "The Evolution of Mom Dancing", a series of such dance moves as "The 'Go Shopping, Get Groceries'", "The 'Raise the Roof'", "The 'Sprinkler'", "The 'Just The Hands Part of [[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)|Single Ladies]]'", "The 'Where's Your Father? (Get Him Back Here!)'", "The '[[Pulp Fiction]]'", "The 'Out of Sync [[Electric Slide]]'", and "The '[[Dougie]]'".  The sketch was in honor of Mrs. Obama's "[[Let's Move!]]" campaign to end childhood obesity.

Later, Jimmy and [[Justin Timberlake]] performed "The Evolution of End Zone Dancing", featuring some real touchdown dances like the "'[[Ickey Shuffle]]'" and "The 'Dirty Bird'", as well as other dances, such as "The 'Touchdown Robot'", "The 'Old-Timey Railroad Car'", "The 'Earthquake Waiter'", "The 'I Thought I Just Saw [[Aaron Hernandez]]'", "The 'Football Spin' (Into The Love Scene From "[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]")", and "The 'Justin Timberlake' (From [['N Sync]])" (the last of which mock-infuriated Timberlake, causing him to shove Jimmy and leave the set).

Then there was an edition which featured Jimmy and New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]] performing "The Evolution of Dad Dancing".

On February 17, 2014, Fallon teamed up with [[Will Smith]] for "Evolution of Hip Hop Dancing".

This is a '''list of [[Royal Variety Performance]]s''', gala evenings held annually in the United Kingdom, which are attended by senior members of the [[British Royal Family]]; initially this was always the reigning monarch(s) but in more recent years, the senior members attending have alternated between HM The Queen and HRH The Duke of Edinburgh, HM The Queen Mother, and HRH The Prince of Wales.

'''''Making Samba: A New History of Race and Music in Brazil''''' is a book by Marc A. Hertzman published by [[Duke University Press]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/Making-Samba/|title=Making Samba|work=Duke University Press|access-date=2018-01-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hertzman's concern with the historical narrative surrounding how [[Samba]] became one of Brazil's most valuable cultural staples prompted him to write this book. By tracing the careers of {{ill|Donga (musician)|lt=Donga|pt|Donga (músico)}} and [[Gilberto Gil]] from the late nineteenth century to the 1970s, Hertzman explores various themes such as intellectual property claims, popular music, race, gender, national identity, and the history of Afro-Brazilians in Rio de Janeiro, and how they all contribute to the making of Samba within the Brazilian State.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
== Synopsis ==
Hertzman's main argument in this book is that the historical narrative surrounding the emergence of samba in Brazil has either been over-criticized, or exceedingly fetishized. By using wide ranging evidence, such as Brazilian musicians' salary contracts, their involvement and activism with various musical associations, and their encounters with law enforcement, Hertzman explores their struggles in exerting their agency by claiming their music as what he calls, "intellectual property." While Hertzman's book explores different themes such as "musical blackface" and "the purity of samba," Hertzman discusses them within the context of [[Afro-Brazilians|Afro-Brazilian]] figures that were heavily involved with the progress of Samba so that his argument doesn't get off track.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Critical Reception ==

''Making Samba: A New History of Race and Music in Brazil'' has been highly praised by a variety of historical scholars. Three critical reviews come from Charles A. Perrone in the [[Luso-Brazilian Review]] 51 (2014): 209-213.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrone|first=Charles A.|date=2014|title=Review of Making Samba: A New History of Race &amp; Music in Brazil by Marc A.

'''''Mass Appeal''''' is a two-character play by Bill C. Davis. The [[comedy-drama]] focuses on the conflict between a complacent [[Roman Catholic]] [[pastor]] and the idealistic young [[deacon]] who is assigned to his affluent, suburban [[parish]].

==Plot==
Father Tim Farley is highly popular with his parishioners due to his charm, wit, easy-going manner, and entertaining (but unchallenging) [[sermons]]. One Sunday, [[seminary|seminarian]] Mark Dolson interrupts Farley's sermon to challenge his stance on the ordination of women. The pastor is outraged yet intrigued by the young man, and asks to have him assigned to work with him.

Dolson is a firebrand eager to change the Church. He enjoys attacking Farley's "song and dance theology" and questioning why he drinks so much. Dolson feels it's his job to shake parishioners out of their complacency. Farley likes Dolson, but sees that he'll never succeed as a priest if all he does is irritate people and make enemies. Each man has something to teach the other about how to perform his priestly duties.

==Productions==
''Mass Appeal'' was first performed in many small theatres, including The No Smoking Playhouse in Manhattan, produced by Pearl Tisman Minsky and Ken Berman, with Berman playing the role of Farley and Bill Davis playing the role of Dolson. At the suggestion of the pastor of [[The Actors' Church]], Minsky brought the play to [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]], with whom she was acquainted. When Fitzgerald agreed to direct the play, she took it to Circle In The Square Theatre in Greenwich Theatre who agreed to workshop it. After the workshop, Circle In The Square did not pursue the play. Geraldine Fitzgerald continued to develop the script with Davis making extensive revisions that greatly improved it. Minsky was about to bring the play to Lynn Meadows at the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]]. Fitzgerald suggested that she would bring the play to her as she was better acquainted with her where it was produced to great acclaim. Minsky and Berman met with other producers and put together a package for Broadway. At that point, Davis and Fitzgerald dropped Minsky and Berman, and had the play produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The Broadway playbill for ''Mass Appeal'' notes that the play was produced by arrangement with Minsky and Berman. 
  
The play originally was produced by the [[Manhattan Theatre Club]]. Directed by Geraldine Fitzgerald and starring [[Milo O'Shea]] as Tim Farley and [[Eric Roberts]] as Mark Dolson, it opened at the [[Off-Broadway]] Stage 73 on April 22, 1980 and ran for 104 performances. Fitzgerald won the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for Outstanding New Director.

The Broadway production, again directed by Fitzgerald and starring O'Shea as Tim Farley but with [[Michael O'Keefe]] as Mark Dolson, opened at the [[Booth Theatre]] on November 12, 1981 after 16 previews. It closed on May 16, 1982 after 212 performances.

The play premiered in the [[United Kingdom]] at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]] in [[London]] in 1982 with [[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]] as Father Farley and [[Rupert Everett]] as Mark Dolson. It received its first British revival at the [[Finborough Theatre]] in London in 2006 with [[Kevin Colson]] and Brendan Patricks.

In 1982 the play was performed at Sydney's Seymour Centre theatre, and starred real-life father and son actors Michael and Christopher Pate. Actor/Director Will Stutts toured the United States as Farley in the mid 1980s.

==Awards and nominations==
*[[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play]] (Milo O'Shea, nominee)
*[[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play]] (Geraldine Fitzergald, nominee)
*[[Theatre World Award]] (Michael O'Keefe, '''winner''')

''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Performance and Production'', p. 565. {{ISBN|9780826463227}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Syllabic and melismatic.mid|Play}}]]

'''Melisma''' ([[Greek Language|Greek]]: {{wiktell|μέλισμα}}, ''melisma'', song, air, melody; from {{wiktell|μέλος}}, ''melos'', song, melody, plural: ''melismata'') is the singing of a single [[syllable]] of [[lyrics|text]] while moving between several different [[Musical note|note]]s in succession. Music sung in this style is referred to as ''melismatic'', as opposed to ''syllabic'', in which each syllable of text is matched to a single note.

==History==

===General===
Music of ancient cultures used melismatic techniques to induce a hypnotic [[trance]] in the listener,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} useful for early mystical initiation rites (such as [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}) and religious worship. This quality is still found in [[Arabic music]] where the scale consists of "[[quarter tone]]s". [[Orthodox Christian]] chanting also bears a slight resemblance to this. Middle Eastern melismatic music was developed further in the Torah [[Cantillation|chanting]], as well as by the [[Masoretes]] in the seventh or eighth centuries. It then appeared in some genres of [[Gregorian chant]], where it was used in certain sections of the [[Mass (music)|Mass]], with the earliest written appearance around AD 900. The [[gradual]] and the [[alleluia]], in particular, were characteristically melismatic, for example, while the [[Tract (liturgy)|tract]] is not, and repetitive melodic patterns were deliberately avoided in the style. The [[Byzantine Rite]] also used melismatic elements in its music, which developed roughly concurrently with the Gregorian chant.

In Western music, the term "melisma" most commonly refers to [[Gregorian chant]] (the first definition of melisma by the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=melismatic Melismatic – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is "a group of notes or tones sung on one syllable in [[plainsong]]"). However, the term melisma may be used to describe music of any genre, including [[baroque]] singing and later [[gospel music|gospel]]. Within Jewish liturgical tradition, melisma is still commonly used in the chanting of [[Torah]], readings from the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], and in the body of a service. For an examination of the evolution of this tradition, see [[Abraham Zevi Idelsohn|Idelsohn]].

Today, melisma is commonly used in [[Middle Eastern music|Middle Eastern]], [[African music|African]], [[Music of Southeastern Europe|Balkan]], and [[African American Music|African American]] music, [[Fado]] (Portuguese), [[Flamenco]] (Spanish), and various [[Asian music|Asian]] folk and popular musical genres. Melisma is also commonly featured in Western [[popular music]].  Early in their careers, [[Ray Charles]], [[Aretha Franklin]], and [[Stevie Wonder]] used it sparingly.&lt;ref name=NYT_2013.12.24/&gt;  Melisma is used by countless pop artists such as [[Michael Jackson]], although this form usually involves improvising melismata (and melismatic [[vocalise]]) over a simpler melody. During the fadeout of the Beatles' 1966 track "[[I Want to Tell You]]", bassist [[Paul McCartney]] can be heard singing a high-pitched melisma in the style of classical Indian music.

===Prevalence in popular music (mid 1980s to late 2000s)===

The use of melisma is a common feature of artists such as [[Deniece Williams]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Luther Vandross]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Christina Aguilera]], among others.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web| last=Everitt | first=Lauren |title= Whitney Houston and the art of melisma | date= | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17039208 | work=BBC News | accessdate=2014-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whoanelly"&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/whoa-nelly%21-mw0000103677 "Whoa, Nelly!" review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine]&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of melismatic vocals in pop music slowly grew in the 1980s. [[Deniece Williams]] topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in May 1984, with [[Let's Hear It for the Boy]] with her melismatic vocals. Although other artists used melisma before, Houston,  her rendition of [[Dolly Parton]]'s love song "[[I Will Always Love You]]" pushed the technique into the mainstream in the '90s.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The trend in [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] singers is considered to have been popularized by Mariah Carey's song "[[Vision of Love]]", which was released and topped the charts at number one in 1990, and went on to be certified gold.&lt;ref name=TheVillageVoice-Feb2003&gt;{{Cite news | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = "Vision of Love" sets off melisma trend | newspaper = [[The Village Voice]] | pages = | year = | date = February 4, 2003 | url = | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Recent backlash (late 2000s – early 2010s)===

As late as 2007, melismatic singers such as [[Leona Lewis]] were still scoring big hits, but around 2008–2009, this trend reverted to how it was prior to Carey and Houston's success – singers with less showy styles such as [[Kesha]] and [[Cheryl Cole]] began to outsell new releases by Carey and Christina Aguilera, ending nearly two decades of the style's dominance of pop-music vocals.&lt;ref name="NYT_2013.12.24"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/arts/music/26browne.html Out With Mariah's Melisma, In With Kesha's Kick: Trilling Songbirds Clip Their Wings].  Browne, David, December 24, 2010. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The French carol tune "Gloria" arranged by [[Edward Shippen Barnes]] in 1937, to which the hymn "[[Angels We Have Heard on High]]" is usually sung, contains one of the most melismatic sequences in popular Christian hymn music, on the "o" of the word "Gloria", which is held through 16 different notes.  "[[Ding Dong Merrily on High]]", arranged by [[George Ratcliffe Woodward]], contains an even longer melisma of 31 notes, also on the "o" of "Gloria".

[[George Frideric Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' contains numerous examples of melisma, as in the following excerpt from the chorus "For Unto Us a Child Is Born"  ([[Messiah Part I#12|Part I, No. 12]]). The soprano and alto lines engage in a 57-note melisma on the word "born".

&lt;!--this image displayed wider than 400px for clarity--&gt;
[[Image:Handel Messiah - For Unto Us a Child is Born excerpt.JPG|center|577px]]
{{audio|Handel Messiah - For Unto Us a Child is Born excerpt.mid|Play}}

Melisma is also used, though rarely and briefly, in the music of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]: examples include the eponymous track of the album ''[[Songs From the Wood]]'' and the song "Skating Away (On the Thin Ice of the New Day)". One of the most striking instances in recent pop music occurs in [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "[[The Ties That Bind (Bruce Springsteen song)|The Ties that Bind]]", in which the "I" in "bind" is iterated 13 times.

[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] also uses melisma in his ''[[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem Mass in D minor]]'' ([[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 626) in the ''[[Kyrie]]'' [[Sequence (poetry)|sequence]], with the "e" in "eleison" being elaborately sung in various notes.

'''''Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro''''' is a December 1863 [[hoax]] [[pamphlet]] created by ''[[New York World]]'' staff as part of an anti-Lincoln [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperhead]] campaign leading up to the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Sidney|date=1949|title=The Miscegenation Issue in the Election of 1864|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=34|issue=3|pages=274–343|doi=10.2307/2715904|jstor=2715904}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 72-page piece coined the term ''[[miscegenation]]'' (from the Latin ''miscere'' "to mix" + ''genus'' "kind") and was put together by ''World'' managing editor [[David Goodman Croly]] and reporter George Wakeman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NDzSypIhISUC&amp;pg=PA318|title=Reelecting Lincoln: The Battle For The 1864 Presidency|last=Waugh|first=John|date=2009-04-30|publisher=Da Capo Press, Incorporated|isbn=9780786747115|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work purports to be a sincere advocacy of the virtues of racial mixing, but it is a [[literary forgery]] intended to argue against racial equality, and to blame the Lincoln administration for allegedly supporting this goal.  The authors unsuccessfully attempted to trick Lincoln into endorsing the work.  The ''World'' also featured a hoax about a "Miscegenation Ball" with interracial dancing alleged to have been held at a Republican function in New York City during the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/05/02/how-a-racist-newspaper-defeated-lincoln-in-new-york-in-the-1864-election|title=How a Racist Newspaper Defeated Lincoln in New York in the 1864 Election|last=Holzer|first=Harold|date=2013-05-02|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Film Registry''' ('''NFR''') is the United States [[National Film Preservation Board]]'s (NFPB) selection of [[film]]s deserving of [[preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]]. The NFPB, established by the [[National Film Preservation Act]] of 1988, was reauthorized by [[Act of Congress|acts of Congress]] in 1992, 1996, 2005, and again in October 2008.&lt;ref name="NFPASigned"&gt;{{cite news|title=Reagan Signs Law on Film|work=The New York Times|date=September 28, 1988|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/28/movies/reagan-signs-law-on-film.html?sec=&amp;spon=|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ActsCongress"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative Authorization |publisher=[[National Film Preservation Board]] |url=https://www.loc.gov/film/filmabou.html |accessdate=July 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829144823/http://www.loc.gov/film/filmabou.html |archivedate=August 29, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PL110336"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Law 110–336—Oct. 2, 2008|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-110publ336/pdf/PLAW-110publ336.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=August 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFPB's mission, to which the NFR contributes, is to ensure the survival, conservation, and increased public availability of America's film heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/about-this-program|title=About This Program - National Film Preservation Board|author=|date=|website=loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1996 law also created the non-profit [[National Film Preservation Foundation]] which, although affiliated with the NFPB, raises money from the [[private sector]].&lt;ref name="NFPFPrivate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Michael|title=Running Around San Francisco for an Education|work=[[SF Weekly]]|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2003-05-28/film/running-around-san-francisco-for-an-education/|date=May 28, 2003|accessdate=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFPB adds to the NFR up to 25&amp;nbsp;"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant films" each year, showcasing the range and diversity of [[Cinema of the United States|American film heritage]] to increase awareness for its preservation.&lt;ref name="Milli25Films"&gt;{{cite news|title=National Film Registry Adds 25 Films|publisher=Millimeter|date=December 17, 2002|url=http://digitalcontentproducer.com/news/video_national_film_registry/|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film becomes eligible for inclusion ten&amp;nbsp;years after its original release.&lt;ref name="10YearsNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Molotsky|first=Irvin|title=25 Films Chosen for the National Registry|work=The New York Times|date=September 20, 1989|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/20/movies/25-films-chosen-for-the-national-registry.html|accessdate=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first selection in 1989, the public nominated almost 1,000&amp;nbsp;films for consideration.

{{quote box|width=27.7em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote="Taken together, the&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;films in the National Film Registry represent a stunning range of American filmmaking—including Hollywood features, documentaries, avant-garde and amateur productions, films of regional interest, ethnic, animated, and short film subjects—all deserving recognition, preservation and access by future generations. As we begin this new millennium, the registry stands among the finest summations of American cinema's wondrous first century."|source=—Dr. [[James H. Billington]], [[Library of Congress#Librarians of Congress|Librarian of Congress]].&lt;ref name="Milli25Films"/&gt;}}
The NFR includes films ranging from Hollywood classics to [[orphan film]]s. A film is not required to be [[Feature film|feature-length]], nor is it required to have been [[Movie theater|theatrically]] released in the traditional sense. In addition, television programs, commercials, and foreign films are not excluded from consideration, although American films are given preference. The Registry contains [[newsreel]]s, [[silent film]]s, student films, [[experimental film]]s, [[short film]]s, [[music video]]s, films out of [[copyright]] protection or in the public domain, [[Serial film|film serial]]s, [[home movies]], documentaries, animation and [[independent film]]s. As of the 2017 listing, there are 725&amp;nbsp;films in the Registry.&lt;ref name="2017Add"/&gt;

Currently, the earliest listed film is ''[[Newark Athlete]]'' (1891), and the most recent is ''[[13 Lakes]]'' (2004). Counting the 11&amp;nbsp;multi-year serials in the NFR once each (as the NFR does) by year of completion, the year with the most films selected is 1939, with 19&amp;nbsp;films from that year chosen.&lt;!-- The latter was computed by copying &amp; pasting the thru-2010 list (550 films) from here into Excel 2007, entering completion years for serials, and running a PivotTable on it counting films by release year. --&gt; The time between a film's debut and its selection varies greatly. The longest span is 121&amp;nbsp;years; ''Edison Kinetographic Record of a Sneeze'' was originally released in 1894 and selected in 2015. The shortest span is the minimum 10&amp;nbsp;years; this distinction is shared by ''[[Raging Bull]]'', ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', ''[[Goodfellas]]'', ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'' and ''[[13 Lakes]]''.

===Number of films by release year===
This table is through the 2018 induction list (727 films total). For purposes of this list, multi-year serials are counted only once (as they are in the Registry) by year of completion.
&lt;!-- This was done by applying a PivotTable in Excel 2007 to the current 550-film list in Wikipedia as of Oct 14, 2011 (above), with completion years entered for multi-year serials. *DO NOT* change until the 2011 inductions, unless a consensus comes up with a better standard for multi-year serials that counts each serial *ONLY ONCE* (as the Registry itself does), *OR* you find the release year in Wikipedia does *NOT* match the official LoC list. (If you think the LoC got it wrong, take it up with them—not Wikipedia.) --&gt;

The '''National Symphony Orchestra''' (Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional, abbreviated OSN) is the state symphony orchestra of [[Peru]]; it is located in [[Lima]].  It is one of the components of the Peruvian [[Instituto Nacional de Cultura]].  As of 2007, the orchestra had ninety members.  Besides the traditional classical repertory, the orchestra also performs Latin American and Peruvian works, including numerous world premieres.

==History==
Before the formation of the National Symphony Orchestra, there was an amateur symphony orchestra, founded in 1907 under the auspices of the [[Lima Philharmonic Society]] (Sociedad Filarmónica de Lima).  The National Symphony Orchestra was founded during the administration of [[Óscar R. Benavides]] by law of 11 August 1938.  It initially consisted of sixty-four musicians, half of them native Peruvians, the other half foreigners then living in Peru or hired by contract from abroad.  The orchestra gave its first concert on 11 December 1938 at the [[Teatro Municipal de Lima]], under the baton of [[Theo Buchwald]], as part of the eighth [[International Conference of American States]].  The program featured the [[National Anthem of Peru]], plus works by [[Beethoven]], [[Debussy]], [[Manuel de Falla]], [[Ravel]], and [[Wagner]].

The first director of the orchestra was the viennese conductor Theo Buchwald, who remained in that position until his death in 1960.  This epoch of the orchestra's existence is considered its most brilliant period, since the orchestra had among her members many talented musicians who had come  from Europe to Peru when fleeing the [[Second World War]], among them many [[Jews]] [http://www.lp.edu.pe/l_trahtemberg/otros/judio251102.htm].  Visiting conductors who led the orchestra included [[Fritz Busch]], [[Carlos Chávez]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Antal Doráti]], [[Erich Kleiber]], [[Igor Markevitch]], [[Malcolm Sargent]], [[Hermann Scherchen]], and [[Igor Stravinsky]].  Visiting soloists who performed with the orchestra included [[Claudio Arrau]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], [[Artur Rubinstein]], [[Andrés Segovia]] and [[Nicanor Zabaleta]].  A period of decline began in the 1960s, due in part to the socio-economic problems of Peru and to government cultural policies.  The orchestra is now passing through a period of financial crisis and managerial reorganization that has engendered much controversy, partly over the transfer of the management of the orchestra to the [[National Association of Musical Performing Arts Organizations]] (Asociación Nacional de Elencos Musicales).[http://www.elcomercioperu.com.pe/edicionimpresa/html/2006%2D05%2D02/impopinion0498700.html] [http://www.elcomercioperu.com.pe/edicionimpresa/html/2006%2D05%2D05/impdominical0500828.html]  In August 2006, angered that they would not be paid for a performance of [[Mozart's Requiem]] with the [[National Chorus (Peru)]] (Coro Nacional), the union of musicians of the orchestra refused to play, and a substitute orchestra was hurriedly assembled instead.[http://www.elcomercioperu.com.pe/edicionimpresa/html/2006%2D08%2D22/imecluces0563351.html]

The orchestra has long promoted the work of Peruvian composers, and it has performed works by [[Daniel Alomía Robles]], [[Celso Garrido-Lecca]], Roberto Carpio, Enrique Iturriaga, [[Armando Guevara Ochoa]], [[Ernesto López Mindreau]], [[Enrique Pinilla]], [[Francisco Pulgar Vidal]], [[Alfonso de Silva]], [[Teodoro Valcárcel]] and  Edgar Valcárcel, among others.

==Locations==
The orchestra's home for many years was the Teatro Municipal de Lima.  The orchestra currently performs at the [[Gran Teatro Nacional]], but it also gives educational concerts elsewhere in Lima and throughout Peru.

The '''Orchestra Invisibile''' (Invisible Orchestra) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[band (music)|band]] formed in 2005 in [http://www.cascinarossago.net/ Cascina Rossago] (PV, Italy), the first Italian farm community designed to meet the needs and unfold possibilities of young adults with [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Politi P, Emanuele E, Grassi M, Invisible Orchestra Project. | year = 2011| title = Development of the "Playing-in-Touch"(PiT) questionnaire: a measure of musical intouchness in people with low-functioning autism.| journal =Neuro Endocrinology Letters | volume =33 |pp=552-558 | pmid=23090275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original group, formed by the first guests of Cascina Rossago and some students, trainee psychiatrists and professors of the [[University of Pavia]], has grown to the actual number of 25 components, 12 of them affected by [[autism]]. The band counts 14 percussionists, 5 saxophonist, 3 trumpeters, 3 trombonists, one tuba player and a double-bass player, with several pianists. The term ''invisibile'' (invisible) refers to a feature of the group: the need to restrain the ''visibility'' of the musicians, to minimize distress for the more sensitive components, which could find the presence of an audience difficult to tolerate. Nevertheless, the ''Orchestra Invisibile'' appeared in public and performed live in theatres ([[Torino]], [http://www.comune.pv.it/site/home/archivio-news/articolo17044.html/ Pavia]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [http://www.associazionepaoloperduca.it/2012/03/22-aprile-orchestra-invisibile/ and Tortona],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Concerto dell’Orchestra Invisibile|magazine=La Provincia Pavese|date=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [https://web.archive.org/web/20160701211610/http://caffeinacultura.eu/event/sunday-meet-up-2/ Viterbo]. Yet, the communicative exchanges within the band are mainly non-verbal. The majority of the ''Orchestra Invisibile'''s repertoire is jazz [[mainstream]]. The experience has shown how this musical genre could be a good compromise between the consistency of the harmonic structures and the changes deriving from the improvisation and the spirit of freedom, characteristic features of [[jazz]]. This can be heard in their first album Orchestra Invisibile, live 2012, published by the independent label [[Etichette Invisibili]]. This would sound like an off-key and uncoordinated group in the beginning that gradually harmonizes and synchronizes reaching a pleasant ensemble towards the end. The only way to assist the rehearsals is to actively participate by playing. This aspect has promoted the collaboration with famous musicians as [[Ellade Bandini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ellade Bandini e l’Orchestra Invisibile – Face To Face|url=http://www.drumsetmag.com/ellade-bandini-e-lorchestra-invisibile/|magazine=Drumset Mag.

Another critical feature of the band is the circular setting, both during rehearsals and live concerts, alternating melodic and rhythmic instruments, consistently with the [[sameness]] during the weekly rehearsals and the performance on stage. This disposition aims at improving the communication within the band, facilitating the visual contact. From the talent of Simona Concaro, and thanks to the contribution of the international musician [http://www.hannashybayeva.com/ Hanna Shybayeva], the album Playing with Autism 1.0 ([[Etichette Invisibili]], INVI1301) and the book Playing with Autism 1.1 - Encountering Simona Concaro by Her Music (PUP 2014) have recently been published. Simona Concaro's executions have further been recorded in Playing with Autism 2.0 ([[Etichette Invisibili]], INVI1401).
In 2015 it was published the photographic book Orchestra Invisibile (Jaca Book 2015). Celebrating the ten years of activity, the Orchestra Invisibile performed two live concerts at the [http://www.comune.casale-monferrato.al.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeAttachment.php/L/IT/D/0%252F3%252F1%252FD.24302fdf068554f7f9ae/P/BLOB%3AID%3D5664/E/pdf Teatro Municipale] of Casale Monferrato (AL, Italy) and at the Auditorium of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20151212233405/http://www.paviabarocca.it/concerti/concerto123/ Istituto Vittadini] of Pavia (Italy). Furthermore, Edizioni Cardano of Pavia published the book Ritratti Invisibili as a gift for the percussionists of the band.
In 2016 the Orchestra Invisibile took part at the Caffeina Festival in Viterbo, gaining the favour of both audience and critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orchestra Invisibile, quando la musica cura l'anima|url=http://www.tusciatimes.eu/orchestra-invisibile-quando-la-musica-cura-lanima/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, in the context of the [[World Autism Awareness Day]], the Orchestra played at the auditorium Tiziano Zalli of the Banca Popolare di [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Gaia Curci|title=A Lodi suona l’Orchestra invisibile, la musica aiuta gli autistici a integrarsi | url=http://laprovinciapavese.gelocal.it/tempo-libero/2017/04/01/news/a-lodi-suona-l-orchestra-invisibile-la-musica-aiuta-gli-autistici-a-integrarsi-1.15125530/}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed by [[Renzo Piano]].

The '''Party at the Palace''', was a British music concert and celebration held in [[London]] in 2002. The event was in commemoration of the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II]] held over the [[Golden Jubilee Weekend]] 1–4 June 2002. The event itself was hosted at [[Buckingham Palace Garden]] on 3 June 2002. It was the pop/rock equivalent of the [[Prom at the Palace]], that showcased [[classical music]].

==Event and venue==
The concert was held at the gardens of Buckingham Palace Garden as part of the Golden Jubilee. The event was touted as the greatest concert in Britain since [[Live Aid]] or possibly ever. Tickets to the event were determined by a lottery. 12,000 people attended the concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/entertainment/2002/jubilee/concert/7.stm |title=Picture Gallery |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 1 million people watched outside the Palace in [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] and around the [[Victoria Memorial (London)|Queen Victoria Memorial]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Factfiles/TheQueensGoldenJubilee.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626114539/http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Factfiles/TheQueensGoldenJubilee.aspx |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; and 200 million on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2002/50factsonTheQueensGoldenJubileeyear-2002.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216150003/http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2002/50factsonTheQueensGoldenJubileeyear-2002.aspx |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The concert included performances of many hit songs from the reign of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The event was the culmination of a national day of partying. The BBC Music Live Festival also occurred on the day. At 13:00 towns across the [[United Kingdom]] had bands play [[The Beatles]] hit "[[All You Need Is Love]]" before church bells were rung around the country.

==Entertainers==
Amongst others, performers included:

[[Paul McCartney]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Elton John]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Ray Davies]], [[Dame Edna Everage]], [[Tony Iommi]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[S Club 7]], [[Ricky Martin]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Blue (boy band)|Blue]], [[Emma Bunton]], [[Atomic Kitten]],  [[Mis-Teeq]], [[The Corrs]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Will Young]], [[Ruby Wax]], [[Steve Winwood]] and [[Brian Wilson]].

Also performing was the London cast of the musical ''[[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]]''. Several newspapers mentioned the absence of [[The Rolling Stones]]. The Stones said the event conflicted with their upcoming world tour.

== House band ==
The [[house band]] for the performance consisted of [[Phil Palmer]] (guitar), [[Pino Palladino]] (bass), [[Paul Wickens]] (keyboards), [[Phil Collins]] (drums), [[Ray Cooper]] (percussion), Eric Robinson (saxophone), [[Sam Brown (singer)|Sam Brown]], [[Margo Buchanan]]  and [[Claudia Fontaine]] (backing vocals) and the [[Royal Academy of Music]] Symphony Orchestra conducted by [[Michael Kamen]]. Some performers brought their own musicians to the concert.

The concert was hosted by [[Lenny Henry]] and [[Ben Elton]]. Between some acts were short comedy segments featuring [[Meera Syal]], [[Nina Wadia]], [[Ruby Wax]], [[Kermit the Frog]] (voiced by [[Steve Whitmire]]),  and [[Barry Humphries]] (in characters as [[Dame Edna Everage]] and [[Sir Les Patterson]]).

==Aspects of concert==
The concert began with Brian May performing God Save the Queen on the roof of [[Buckingham Palace]] as a guitar solo with support from the orchestra onstage in the Garden far below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/entertainment/2002/jubilee/concert/1.stm |title=Picture Gallery |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sequence was  spectacularly filmed, including some upward photography of May in full "rock god" mode and shots of the crowd in the Garden below.  It has become an iconic moment and Brian May himself has said in interview that he hoped that he would strike the last chord at the same time as the orchestra in the gardens far below.

Note:  DVD only available in the UK at present;  British ISBN B000IFS05Y&lt;/ref&gt; Ozzy Osbourne recently said in the same interview that this was the greatest moment of his career and pronounced the Queen to be "a beautiful woman."

[[Phil Collins]] played drums for many of the artists, as well as singing his 1983 [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1980s|UK number one single]] "[[You Can't Hurry Love#Phil Collins version|You Can't Hurry Love]]", with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] playing drums. Taylor took late singer [[Freddie Mercury]]'s place by singing lead vocals for the band's 1984 number two hit "[[Radio Ga Ga]]" (which Taylor had also written), with Collins playing drums in place of Taylor.

S Club 7's performance of "Don't Stop Movin'" was announced as the last time the group would be performing as a septet, as [[Paul Cattermole]] had announced his departure from the group prior to the event.

==Royal family commemoration==
The event ended with the Royal Family joining the stars onstage.   [[Prince Charles]] thanked his mother for her fifty years on the throne, famously beginning his speech with the words, "Your Majesty.....MUMMY!" to the delight of the crowd and bemusement of the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2023942.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Charles tribute speech in full |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2002-06-04 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this the Queen and [[Prince Philip]] went to light the National Beacon on the Mall. After the lighting of the beacon the largest fireworks show in the history of London took place. During this time different symbols were projected onto the palace including a [[Union Flag]].

==Recordings==
A DVD has been issued of the performance.  Some portions have been  cut, e.g. [[Ruby Wax]]'s monologue, Dame Edna's introduction of Paul McCartney performing "[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]" and Paul McCartney's spontaneous performance of "[[Her Majesty (song)|Her Majesty]]".&lt;ref&gt;DVD recording ISBN B0000687F4&lt;/ref&gt;

A live CD recording of the performance was also released in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;CD recording ISBN B000069003&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Play of Daniel''''', or ''Ludus Danielis'', is either of two medieval [[Latin]] [[liturgical drama]]s based on the biblical [[Book of Daniel]], one of which is accompanied by [[monophony|monophonic]] music. 

Two medieval plays of Daniel survive. The first is one of the plays in the ''[[Fleury Playbook]]'', a 13th-century [[manuscript]] containing ten liturgical dramas; the text is by [[Hilarius (poet)|Hilarius]], and no music accompanies it. The play itself dates from  c. 1140. The second is a 13th-century drama with monophonic music, written about 1227 to 1234 by students at the school of [[Beauvais Cathedral]], located in northern France.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O76-PlayofDanielThe.html&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of the text is poetic rather than strictly [[liturgy|liturgical]] in origin; it closely follows the narrative of the [[Bible|biblical]] story of [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] at the court of [[Belshazzar]].&lt;ref name="The European Music Series"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.edu/earlymusic/daniel.html|title=The Play of Daniel: European Music Series|last=Eugene|first=Enrico|publisher=The University of Oklahoma|accessdate=2009-11-18|location=Oklahoma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US the latter play was revived in the 1950s by [[Noah Greenberg]], director of the [[New York Pro Musica]]; a commentary in English, written and performed by [[W. H. Auden]], was used in some of their performances. A recorded 1958 performance by the group at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and featuring boy choristers of the [[Church of the Transfiguration (New York, New York)|Church of the Transfiguration]] as satraps and soldiers, was released by [[Decca Records|Decca]], with sleeve notes by [[Paul Henry Lang]] and [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Rembert Weakland]], [[Order of St. Benedict|O.S.B.]], who had discovered the text at the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Joseph Kerman, ''Contemplating Music''. Harvard, 1985, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the New York Pro Musica production it has enjoyed many performances among early music troupes.&lt;ref name="Songs of Peace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songsofpeace.com/ncmcmusic/Mus213/play_of_daniel.htm|title=Play of Daniel: Songs of Peace|publisher=Songs of Peace Online|accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also important in the history of modern revivals of the Beauvais Cathedral version, ''Daniel''  was the 1985 production of the [[Boston Camerata]], staged by Andrea von Ramm, with musical direction by [[Joel Cohen (musician)|Joel Cohen]]. In 2008, The [[Dufay Collective]] and William Lyons released their CD, ''The Play of Daniel'' on the Harmonia Mundi usa label. A new production of the ''Play of Daniel'' by the Boston Camerata, this time under the direction of French-born medievalist [[Anne Azéma]], was presented in Boston in November, 2014. Daniel was played by tenor Jordan Weatherston Pitts.  

In 2008, a new production, staged by Drew Minter with musical direction by Mary Anne Ballard in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the noted [[The Cloisters|Cloisters]] production of 1958, was created, also at the Cloisters.  The show has been reprised in subsequent seasons, in 2012 at the Cloisters and in 2013 and 2014 as part of the Twelfth Night Festival at [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church Wall Street]].

[[File:Citizen-Kane-Welles-Podium.jpg|thumb|right|[[Orson Welles]] in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'']]
The authorship of the '''screenplay for ''[[Citizen Kane]]''''', the 1941 American motion picture that marked the [[List of directorial debuts|feature film debut]] of [[Orson Welles]], has been one of the film's long-standing controversies. With a story spanning 60 years, the [[film à clef|quasi-biographical film]] examines the life and legacy of [[Charles Foster Kane]], played by Welles, a fictional character based in part upon the American newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] and Chicago tycoons [[Samuel Insull]] and [[Harold Fowler McCormick|Harold McCormick]]. A rich incorporation of the experiences and knowledge of its authors, the film earned an [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]] for [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and Welles. 

==Mankiewicz as co-writer==
[[File:Herman J. Mankiewicz.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] co-wrote the script in early 1940. He and Welles separately re-wrote and revised each other's work until Welles was satisfied with the finished product.]]

But, you know, when the bitterness wasn't focused straight at you, he was the best company in the world."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Welles |first1=Orson |authorlink1=Orson Welles |last2=Bogdanovich |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Bogdanovich |last3=Rosenbaum |first3=Jonathan |authorlink3=Jonathan Rosenbaum |title=[[This is Orson Welles]] |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] Publishers |location=New York |date=1992 |isbn=0-06-016616-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|52–53|date=April 2012}}

Welles admired Mankiewicz, and had met him in New York in 1938&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brady |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Brady (writer) |title=Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York |date=1989 |isbn=0-385-26759-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|234}} at the time of the [[Mercury Theatre]]'s Broadway successes. In September 1939&lt;ref name="Meryman"/&gt;{{Rp|244}} Welles visited Mankiewicz while he was hospitalized in Los Angeles after a car accident, and offered him a job writing scripts for the Mercury Theatre's show on CBS radio, ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]''. "I felt it would be useless," Welles said later, "because of Mank's general uselessness many times in the studios. But I thought, 'We'll see what he comes up with.'" Mankiewicz proved very useful, particularly working with Houseman as editor,&lt;ref name="Meryman"/&gt;{{Rp|240–242}} and wrote five scripts for ''Campbell Playhouse'' shows broadcast between November 12, 1939, and March 17, 1940.{{efn|Only four of the five scripts reached the air: "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd", "Dodsworth", "Vanity Fair" and "Huckleberry Finn".&lt;ref name=Meryman/&gt;{{Rp|242}}}}&lt;ref name="Whaley"&gt;[http://www.lybrary.com/barton-whaley-m-191.html Whaley, Barton], ''Orson Welles: The Man Who Was Magic''.

Albany, Georgia: BearManor Media, 2013, {{ISBN|1-59393-260-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|88}} In December 1939, after a violent quarrel with Welles over finances, Houseman resigned and returned to New York.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|356}} To Welles, his departure was a relief.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leaming |first=Barbara |title=Orson Welles, A Biography |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=New York |date=1985 |isbn=978-0-618-15446-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|235–236}}&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|504–505}}

In late December, the executive board of [[RKO Pictures]] all but ordered studio chief [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George Schaefer]] to stop paying salaries to the Mercury Productions staff until Welles submitted an acceptable script and set a start date for filming.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{RP|235}} Over the next five weeks Welles spent many long evenings brainstorming plot ideas in the bedroom of the small rented house where Mankiewicz was in traction with his shattered leg.&lt;ref name=Meryman/&gt;{{Rp|245–246}} Mankiewicz testified in a court proceeding a few years later that the idea for the film began with a ''[[The March of Time|March of Time]]''-style sequence that set out the life of a particular character whose life would then be the subject of the film.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|235}} Welles later said the germinal idea was to create a posthumous portrait of a man through many points of view, in the recollections of those who knew him.{{efn|[[Geraldine Fitzgerald]] claimed to have suggested the multiple-points-of-view structure to Welles. Soon after ''Citizen Kane'' was released, she reportedly told him, "You know, that's taken from that idea I gave you," to which Welles replied, "I don't want you talking about it."&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|246}}}}&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|246}} "I'd been nursing an old notion," Welles told Bogdanovich, "the idea of telling the same thing several times—and showing exactly the same thing from wholly different points of view. Basically, the idea ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' used later on. Mank liked it, so we started searching for the man it was going to be about. Some big American figure—couldn’t be a politician, because you’d have to pinpoint him. [[Howard Hughes]] was the first idea. But we got pretty quickly to the press lords."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|53}}

Welles and Mankiewicz soon settled on the idea of using newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] as their central character.&lt;ref name="Callow"/&gt;{{Rp|484}} By late January their disagreements over plot details were more frequent and their collaboration less creative. "That's why I left him on his own, finally," Welles said later, "because we'd started to waste too much time haggling."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|54}} In February 1940,&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|444, 448}} Welles arranged a lunch at New York's [[21 Club]] and persuaded Houseman to return to California. He was hired to supervise Mankiewicz as he put a rough draft on paper.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|185}}

On February 19, 1940, Mankiewicz signed a contract with Mercury Productions to work on the screenplay.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|359|date=January 2013}} He would receive $1,000 a week for his work as long as he was not "incapacitated by illness or any other reasons",&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|236}} and would be paid a $5,000 bonus on delivery of the script.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"&gt;{{cite book |last=Carringer |first=Robert L. |title=The Making of Citizen Kane |publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |date=1985 |isbn=978-0-520-20567-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|17}} Mankiewicz was to receive no credit for his work as he was hired as a [[script doctor]]; a similar clause was present in the writers' contracts for ''The Campbell Playhouse''.&lt;ref name="Callow"/&gt;{{Rp|487}} Mankiewicz was advised by his agents, Columbia Management of California, and before he signed the contract it was again made clear that all credit for his work belonged to Welles and the Mercury Theatre, the "author and creator".&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|236–237}} Welles hesitated to officially agree to give Mankiewicz credit. His contract with RKO stated that the film would be produced, directed, performed and written by Welles, and his "boy wonder" persona had great publicity value for the studio.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|236}} Welles's attorney, Arnold Weissberger, did not want to give RKO any cause to break Welles's contract should they wish to promote the film as solely his work. The contract with Mankiewicz left the matter of his receiving credit open; Welles's correspondence with his lawyer indicated that he did not wish to deny credit to Mankiewicz.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|202}}

[[File:North-Verde-Ranch-Victorville-Postcard.jpg|thumb|right|Mankiewicz and Houseman worked in seclusion at a historic ranch in Victorville, California, for 12 weeks.]]

After he came to agreement with Welles on the story line and character,&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|54}} Mankiewicz was given the job of writing the first draft that Welles could rework.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|185|December 2014}} In the last week of February or the first week of March 1940,&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|17}} Mankiewicz retreated to the historic North Verde Ranch{{efn|The name of the Victorville ranch where Mankiewicz and Houseman worked changed in 1943, from the North Verde Ranch to its present name, the Kemper Campbell Ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mojavehistory.com/interviewcampbelldeblasis.html |title=Joseph Campbell and Jean De Blasis Interview  |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Mohave Historical Society Oral Histories |publisher=Mojave Desert History |access-date=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} on the Mojave River in [[Victorville, California]], to begin working on the script.&lt;ref name=Lebo/&gt;{{Rp|32|date=May 2009}}&lt;ref name=Kilbourne&gt;{{cite book|last=Kilbourne|first=Don|editor1-last=Morsberger|editor1-first=Robert E.||editor2-last=Lesser|editor2-first=Stephen O.|editor3-last=Clark|editor3-first=Randall|title=[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]|volume=Volume 26: American Screenwriters|publisher=[[Gale Research Company]]|location=Detroit|year=1984|pages=218–224|chapter=Herman Mankiewicz (1897–1953)|isbn=978-0-8103-0917-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|221|date=May 2009}} Welles wanted the work done as inconspicuously as possible,&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|17|date=April 2012}} and the ranch offered the additional advantage of prohibiting alcohol. Mankiewicz was accompanied by a nurse, secretary Rita Alexander, Houseman, and a 300-page rough script of the project that Welles had written. The preliminary work consisted of dialogue and some camera instructions.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|237}}&lt;ref name=Meryman/&gt;{{Rp|252}} Author [[Clinton Heylin]] wrote that Mankiewicz "… probably believed that Welles had little experience as an original scriptwriter … [and] may even have felt that ''John Citizen, USA'', Welles's working title, was a project he could make his own."&lt;ref name=Heylin&gt;{{cite book |last=Heylin |first=Clinton |authorlink=Clinton Heylin |title=Despite the System: Orson Welles Versus the Hollywood Studios |publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]] |location=Chicago, IL |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-556-52547-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|43|date=May 2009}}

Mankiewicz and Houseman worked together in seclusion at the ranch for 12 weeks.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|237}} Houseman was to serve as editor, Carringer noted, "but part of his job was to ride herd on Mankiewicz, whose drinking habits were legendary and whose screenwriting credentials unfortunately did not include a reputation for seeing things through." There was continual communication with Welles,&lt;ref name="Carringer Scripts"/&gt;{{Rp|81}}  and Houseman often travelled to Los Angeles to confer with him. Welles visited the ranch occasionally to check on their progress and offer direction.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|237}} With his own secretary, Katherine Trosper, Welles was reworking the draft pages in Hollywood. These pages were given to RKO script supervisor Amalia Kent, who broke the material down in continuity form for the production units.&lt;ref name="Carringer Scripts"/&gt;{{Rp|81–82}} Welles respected her for her service on the unproduced ''Heart of Darkness'' script.&lt;ref name="Carringer Scripts"/&gt;{{Rp|119}} Welles came to suspect that Houseman had turned Mankiewicz against him.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|213|December 2014}} "When Mank left for Victorville, we were friends. When he came back, we were enemies," Welles told biographer  [[Richard Meryman]]. "Mank always needed a villain."&lt;ref name=Meryman/&gt;{{Rp|260}}

==Ideas and collaboration==
For some time, Mankiewicz had wanted to write a screenplay about a public figure—perhaps a gangster—whose story would be told by the people who knew him.&lt;ref name="Callow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Callow |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Callow |title=Orson Welles: The Road to Xanadu |publisher=[[Viking]] |location=New York |date=1996 |isbn=9780670867226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|484}} In the mid-1930s Mankiewicz had written the first act of an unproduced play about [[John Dillinger]], titled ''The Tree Will Grow''.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|132}} "It was something [Mankiewicz] had been thinking about for years," Houseman wrote, “the idea of telling a man’s private life (preferably one that suggested a recognizable American figure), immediately following his death, through the intimate and often incompatible testimony of those who had known him at different times and in different circumstances.”&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|448–449|date=January 2013}}

Welles himself had worked with the concept. As a teenager in 1932 he wrote a play about the life of abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] called ''[[Marching Song (play)|Marching Song]]''. Like that of ''Citizen Kane'', the play’s plot is structured around a journalist attempting to understand Brown by interviewing people who knew him and have different perspectives on him.

"There is a quality in the film—much more than a vague perfume—that was Mank and that I treasured," Welles said. "It was a kind of controlled, cheerful virulence … I personally liked Kane, but I went with that. And that probably gave the picture a certain tension, the fact that one of the authors hated Kane and one loved him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mankiewicz (with assistance from Houseman and with input from Welles) wrote the first two drafts. His principal contributions were the story frame, a cast of characters, various individual scenes, and a good share of the dialogue. … Welles added the narrative brilliance—the visual and verbal wit, the stylistic fluidity, and such stunningly original strokes as the newspaper montages and the breakfast table sequence. He also transformed Kane from a cardboard fictionalization of Hearst into a figure of mystery and epic magnificence. ''Citizen Kane'' is the only major Welles film on which the writing credit is shared. Not coincidentally, it is also the Welles film that has the strongest story, the most fully realized characters, and the most carefully sculpted dialogue. Mankiewicz made the difference.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|35}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Welles called Mankiewicz's contribution to the script "enormous".&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|52–53|date=April 2012}} He summarized the screenwriting process: "The initial ideas for this film and its basic structure were the result of direct collaboration between us; after this we separated and there were two screenplays: one written by Mr. Mankiewicz, in Victorville, and the other, in Beverly Hills, by myself. … The final version of the screenplay … was drawn from both sources."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|500}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Welles |first=Orson |date=November 17, 1971 |title=The Creation of ''Citizen Kane'' |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, when he was interviewed for the official magazine of the [[Directors Guild of America]], Houseman concurred with Welles's description of the scripting process: "He [Welles] added a great deal of material himself, and later he and Herman had a dreadful row over the screen credit.

==Authorship==
One of the long-standing controversies about ''Citizen Kane'' has been the authorship of the screenplay.&lt;ref name="Meryman"/&gt;{{Rp|237}} Mankiewicz was enraged when an August 1940 column by [[Louella Parsons]] quoted Welles as saying, " … and so I wrote ''Citizen Kane''."&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|201}}&lt;ref name="Callow"/&gt;{{Rp|517}} When RKO released the film in May 1941, the souvenir program included a double-page spread depicting Welles as "the four-most personality of motion pictures … author, producer, director, star."&lt;ref name="Meryman"/&gt;{{Rp|270}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Souvenir Program, Citizen Kane |location=New York |publisher=RKO Pictures/Winkler and Ramen |date=1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mankiewicz wrote his father, "I'm particularly furious at the incredibly insolent description of how Orson wrote his masterpiece. The fact is that there isn't one single line in the picture that wasn't in writing—writing from and by me—before ever a camera turned."&lt;ref name=Meryman&gt;{{cite book |last=Meryman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Meryman |title=Mank: The Wit, World and Life of Herman Mankiewicz |publisher=[[William Morrow and Company]], Inc. |location=New York |date=1978 |isbn=978-0-688-03356-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|270|date=May 2009}}

Mankiewicz had seen rushes of the film shortly before this and said he was unhappy with the footage. However, Mankiewicz's assessment of the footage was full of contradictions. He told Welles that there were "not enough standard movie conventions being observed" and that he disliked the theatricality and lack of close-ups in the film. But Mankiewicz also called the footage "magnificent" and said he liked it "from an ascetical point of view." He also said that he thought the audience would not understand the film.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|204|December 2014}}

Mankiewicz began threatening Welles to get credit for the film. This included threatening to post full-page ads in trade papers and getting his friend [[Ben Hecht]] to write an exposé about their collaboration in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]''. Mankiewicz also threatened to go to the [[Screen Writers Guild]] and claim full credit for writing the entire script by himself. Welles biographer Barbara Leaming believes that Mankiewicz reacted this way out of fear of getting no credit at all.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|204|December 2014}}

After lodging a protest with the Screen Writers Guild, Mankiewicz withdrew it, then vacillated. The question was resolved in January 1941 when RKO awarded Mankiewicz credit. The guild credit form listed Welles first, Mankiewicz second. Welles's assistant Richard Wilson said that the person who circled Mankiewicz's name in pencil, then drew an arrow that put it in first place, was Welles. The official credit reads, "Screenplay by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles".&lt;ref name=Meryman/&gt;{{Rp|264–265}}

Mankiewicz's rancor toward Welles grew over the remaining 12 years of his life. Welles's irritation with Mankiewicz passed quickly, and he spoke of him with fondness.&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|498}}

"One of the things that bound his friends to him was his extraordinary vulnerability," Welles told Mankiewicz's biographer. "He liked the attention he got as a great, monumental self-destructing machine. That was his role, and he played it to the hilt. He was a performer, as I think all very successful personalities are. He couldn’t be affectionate or loving outside his family. You never felt you were basking in the warmth of his friendship. So it was his vulnerability that brought the warmth out from the friends. And people loved him. ''Loved'' him. That terrible vulnerability. That terrible wreck."&lt;ref name=Meryman/&gt;{{Rp|168}}

Welles further said this to Mankiewicz's biographer: "I have only one real enemy in my life that I know about, and that is John Houseman. Everything begins and ends with that hostility behind the mandarin benevolence."&lt;ref name=Meryman/&gt;{{Rp|255}}

Any question of authorship was resolved with Carringer's 1978 essay, "The Scripts of Citizen Kane".&lt;ref name="Carringer Scripts"/&gt;{{efn|First published in ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'', "The Scripts of Citizen Kane" was described by Rosenbaum as "the definitive piece of scholarship on the authorship of ''Kane''—and sadly one of the least well known". He wrote that many biographers may wrongly assume that Carringer included all of its facts in his later book, ''The Making of Citizen Kane''.&lt;ref name="Discovering OW"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan (editor) |title=Discovering Orson Welles |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, CA |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-520-25123-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|18, 247}}}} Carringer studied the collection of script records—"almost a day-to-day record of the history of the scripting"—that was then still intact at RKO. He reviewed all seven drafts and concluded that "the full evidence reveals that Welles's contribution to the ''Citizen Kane'' script was not only substantial but definitive."&lt;ref name="Carringer Scripts"&gt;{{cite book |last=Carringer |first=Robert L. |editor-last=Naremore |editor-first=James |title=Orson Welles's Citizen Kane: A Casebook |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2004 |origyear=first published 1978 |pages=79–121 |chapter=The Scripts of ''Citizen Kane'' |isbn=978-0-19-515892-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|80}}

Carringer found that the issues raised by Kael rested on the evidence of an early draft of the screenplay, primarily written by Mankiewicz,&lt;ref name="Carringer Scripts"/&gt;{{Rp|80}} which "elaborated the plot logic and laid down the overall story contours, established the main characters, and provided numerous scenes and lines that would eventually appear in one form or another in the film."&lt;ref name="Carringer Scripts"/&gt;{{Rp|115}} At that stage of the scripting, Kane was a caricature of Hearst rather than the fully developed character of the final film.&lt;ref name="Carringer Scripts"/&gt;{{Rp|98, 116}} Carringer found clues in the second draft that Welles was guiding the script, and in the third draft he documented Welles's direct involvement&lt;ref name="Carringer Scripts"/&gt;{{Rp|105}} and responsibility for the first major revisions.&lt;ref name="Carringer Scripts"/&gt;{{Rp|109–110}} "That the subsequent installments are also attributable chiefly to Welles is indicated both by the circumstances and by the nature of the revisions," Carringer wrote.&lt;ref name="Carringer Scripts"/&gt;{{Rp|116}}

Carringer observed that ''Citizen Kane'' is one of the few Welles projects based on an original story idea rather than an adaption of existing work. "Mankiewicz was hired to furnish him with what any good first writer ought to be able to provide in such a case: a solid, durable story structure on which to build," Carringer wrote. Welles then "adapted it with the same freedom and disregard for authority with which he adapt[ed] a Shakespeare play or a thriller by Nicholas Blake."&lt;ref name="Carringer Scripts"/&gt;{{Rp|117}}

==Accolades==
The screenplay for ''Citizen Kane'' received the [[14th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]], shared by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles.&lt;ref name="Oscars1942"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1942 |title=The 14th Academy Awards (1942) Nominees and Winners |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science |accessdate=March 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Ambiguously Gay Duo''''' is an American animated [[sketch comedy|comedy sketch]] that debuted on ''[[The Dana Carvey Show]]'' before moving to its permanent home on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Animation: TV &amp; Broadcast – The Dana Carvey Show | url=http://www.jjsedelmaier.com/animation/carvey.html | publisher=J.J.

== Background ==
''The Ambiguously Gay Duo'' is a [[parody]] of the stereotypical [[comic book]] superhero duo done in the style of [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning cartoons]] like ''[[Super Friends]]''. The characters are clad in matching pastel turquoise tights, dark blue [[domino mask]]s, and bright yellow coordinated gauntlets, boots and shorts. The shorts were intended to satirize suggestions that early [[Batman]] comics implied a [[Homosexuality in the Batman franchise|homosexual relationship]] between the eponymous title character and his [[sidekick|field partner]] and [[protégé]] [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], a charge most infamously leveled by [[Fredric Wertham]] in his 1954 book, ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wertham | first=Fredric | title=Seduction of the Innocent | edition=First | location=New York | publisher=Rinehart &amp; Company, Inc | year=1954 | oclc=10526406}}&lt;/ref&gt; the research methodology for which was later discredited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/books/flaws-found-in-fredric-werthams-comic-book-studies.html?_r=0|title=Flaws Found in Fredric Wertham’s Comic-Book Studies|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|date=February 19, 2013|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical episode usually begins with the duo's [[arch-nemesis]] Bighead, a criminal mastermind with an abnormally large [[Human cranium|cranium]]. Bighead is usually briefing his henchmen on a plot for some grandiose plan for world domination, interrupted by a debate as to whether or not Ace and Gary (The Ambiguously Gay Duo) are gay. Once the crime is in process, the police commissioner calls on the superheroes to save the day, often engaging in similar debates with the chief of police.
[[File:Tv snl ambiguously flying.jpg|thumb|The Ambiguously Gay Duo with Gary mounting Ace in flight]]

Ace and Gary set out to foil the evil plan, but not before calling attention to themselves with outrageous antics and innuendo, and behaving in ways perceived by other characters to be stereotypically homosexual, as in this conversation from the first episode:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Ace''' [patting Gary on the [[buttocks]]]: Good job, friend-of-friends!&lt;br /&gt;
'''Villains/Bystanders''' [gasps, and ghastly stares]&lt;br /&gt;
'''Ace''': What's everybody looking at?&lt;br /&gt;
'''Villains/Bystanders''' in unison: '''NOTHING!'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similar gags appear in almost every episode.

Episodes not following this general formula have featured Ace and Gary answering fan mail or offering child safety tips. One such episode entails Ace and Gary giving children a ride home in their Duocar and offering home decorating tips, all while blithely making various suggestive gestures and comments.

== Characters ==

=== The Ambiguously Gay Duo ===
* '''Ace''' (voiced by [[Stephen Colbert]]) – Ace is the leader of the duo. He is mentor to Gary, whom he refers to as "friend of friends." He has a wide array of superhuman powers, including most (if not all) of Gary's powers.
* '''Gary''' (voiced by [[Steve Carell]]) – Gary is Ace's "[[sidekick]]" and [[protégé]], and the younger of the duo. Gary is less experienced, and has fewer superhuman powers than Ace. His powers include superhuman strength, breath, stamina, flexibility, flight (though Ace and Gary use the [[phallic]]-shaped Duocar more often than they fly), and "laser vision."

=== Supporting characters ===
* '''[[Announcer]]''' (voiced by [[Bill Chott]]) – The Announcer is a disembodied voice who announces the title of each episode.
* '''The [[Police commissioner|Police Commissioner]]''' (voiced by [[Steve Carell]]) – The Police Commissioner is the duo's primary contact, and when trouble arises, he makes the call to their hangout. His calls tend to interrupt a workout of some kind, with one or the other of the duo shirtless.
* '''The [[Chief of police|Chief of Police]]''' (voiced by [[Bill Chott]]) – The Chief of Police is seen with the commissioner, apparently waiting to find evidence in support of his belief that Ace and Gary are gay.
* '''Kijoro''' – Kijoro is the duo's mentor whose [[Ghost|spirit]] resides in the "Fortress of Privacy" and offers advice from time to time when Ace and Gary seek counsel.
* '''Piño''' – The [[butler]] of Ace and Gary.

=== Villains ===
* '''Bighead''' (voiced by [[Robert Smigel]]) – Bighead is a [[mad scientist]] with a very large, bald head, and is usually the brains behind most of the evil schemes. Second only to his primary vocation of mad scientist is his obsession with [[outing]] the superheroes as gay, which tends to annoy his co-conspirators because they do not care about the duo's sexuality and only want to defeat them in order to rule the world. He is constantly criticized for the amount of energy he invests in this pursuit.
* '''Dr. Brainio''' (voiced by [[Stephen Colbert]]) – Dr. Brainio is another mad scientist with a brain suspended above his head and attached by a trio of cables and tubing. He occasionally partners with Bighead, but is quite a bit more undecided about Ace and Gary.
* '''Orbitrox''' – Orbitrox is a small, green, free-floating droid who sides with Bighead on the question of Ace's and Gary's sexual orientation. Orbitrox has proffered evidence of their having visited [[gay bar]]s, but he emphatically denies visiting them himself, snapping, in subtitled form, "Back off, dickweed, it's research!"
* '''[[Queen regnant|Queen]] Serena''' (voiced by [[Ana Gasteyer]]) – An intergalactic queen.
* '''Flame Eye''' (voiced by [[Bill Hader]]) – A henchman of Bighead and Dr. Brainio with a fiery right eye.
* '''Lizardo''' (voiced by [[Bill Hader]]) – A [[List of reptilian humanoids|lizard man]] henchman of Bighead and Dr. Brainio.
* '''Half-Scary''' – A [[Two-Face]]-like henchman of Bighead and Dr. Brainio.
* '''Flatside''' (voiced by [[Bill Hader]]) – A henchman of Bighead and Dr. Brainio whose head is flat on one side.

=== Other appearances ===
* January 12, 2002: ([[Josh Hartnett]]/[[Pink (singer)|Pink]]), The Ambiguously Gay Duo makes a surprise appearance in ''[[The X-Presidents]]'' episode "The Hunt for Osama." The Ambiguously Gay Duo show up in their Duocar where they help the X-Presidents capture [[Osama bin Laden]].
* April 29, 2006: The Ambiguously Gay Duo co-hosted ''Saturday Night Live: The Best of TV Funhouse''. The hosting duties included the opening monologue performed by Ace and Gary, plus new animated/live-action material during the pre-commercial and post-commercial bumpers. It was revealed during these bumper segments that they seem to have an undying obsession with former cast member [[Jimmy Fallon]]. The show ended with the duo taking cast members [[Jason Sudeikis]] and [[Andy Samberg]] to their secret headquarters — both naked — in the Duocar, with announcer [[Don Pardo]] begging to be taken with them and a spurned Jimmy Fallon looking on from his apartment window with tears in his eyes.
In 2015, Bif Bang Pow Toys produced and released a new 8" retro action-figure line of Ace and Gary titled the Ambiguously Gay Duo 8" retro action figure series. They were both individually packaged on a card but sold together in a set at the Entertainment Earth Catalog and website and at other toy and comic book stores as well. That same year, Bif Bang Pow Toys produced the Ambiguously Gay Duo Tin Tote (Lunchbox) action figure set of four 5" action-figures of Ace, Gary, and Bighead.

'''''The Complete Crumb Comics''''' is an award-winning series of collections from [[Fantagraphics Books]] which was intended to reproduce the entire body of [[People of the United States|American]] [[cartoonist]] and [[comic book]] artist/writer [[Robert Crumb]]'s comics work in chronological order, beginning with his [[Fanzine#Comics and graphic arts fanzines|fanzine]] work from as early as 1958.

While the series was intended to be complete, there is some material missing (most notably ''The Yum Yum Book'', the copyright of which is owned by Crumb's ex-wife Dana,&lt;ref&gt;Pahls, Marty. Introduction to ''The Complete Crumb Comics'' Vol 2.  [[Fantagraphics Books]] 1988.  {{ISBN|978-0-930193-62-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but which has otherwise been in print as ''Big Yum Yum Book: the Story of Oggie and the Beanstalk'').

Its publication is considered to have brought more serious attention to Crumb's oeuvre, and was one of the earliest attempts to collect a cartoonist's full body of work.&lt;ref name="ITB" /&gt; The series lasted 17 volumes and was published up until 2005 (covering Crumb's work up to 1992). After this, Crumb's work was to be collected in individually titled collections, and not be part of the official numbered series.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Volume 17 of "The Complete Crumb Comics", which will be the final volume in the numbered series of compilations. Subsequent volumes will be individually titled collections of various bodies of work, such as "Hup" and "Mystic Funnies."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volumes==
All volumes have been published at some point in both softcover and hardcover editions. Two box sets have also been produced, collected Volumes #1-5 and #6-10, with a slip case and signed plate, limited to 400 sets each.

The first two volumes contain material going back as far as Crumb's teenage years, from before he had had his comics professionally published. Some consider this material to be non-essential, and that it would be better for a newcomer to start with later volumes.&lt;ref name="CBRoverview" group="note" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OpticalSloth" group="note" /&gt;

==Notes==
{{Reflist

&lt;ref name="CBRoverview" group="note"&gt;"Avoid the first two volumes of Complete Crumb consist of early work from his teen-age years and early '20s, and thus are for serious fans who want to see how far he's progressed. It's awkward, juvenile material . . . and really not the place for neophytes to start. Wait until you get a feel for his later work and personality before diving into these books."&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ref name="OpticalSloth" group="note"&gt;". . . a good starting point would probably be somewhere in the middle of the ''Complete Crumb'' volumes. Why the middle?

'''''The Hollywood Reporter''''' ('''''THR''''') is a multi-platform American digital and print magazine founded in 1930 and focusing on the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[film industry]], television, and entertainment industries, as well as Hollywood's intersection with fashion, finance, law, technology, lifestyle, and politics.

Headquartered in [[Los Angeles]], ''THR'' is part of the Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group, a group of properties that includes ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and [[SpinMedia]]. It is owned by [[Valence Media]], a holding company co-founded by [[Todd Boehly]], an executive of its previous owners, [[Guggenheim Partners]] and [[Eldridge Industries]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg-draftkingsfund"&gt;{{cite news| title=Dodgers' Boehly Leads $100 Million DraftKings Investment| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-09/dodgers-boehly-said-to-lead-100-million-draftkings-investment| website=[[Bloomberg News]]| first=Scott| last=Soshnick| date=March 9, 2017| accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Janice Min]], a faltering ''THR'' was relaunched in 2010 as a weekly [[Wide-format printer|large-format print]] magazine with a revamped, continuously updated website, as well as mobile and [[Tablet computer|tablet]] editions.

==History==
===Early years===
''THR'' was founded in 1930 by [[William R. Wilkerson|William R. "Billy" Wilkerson]] (1890–1962) as Hollywood's first daily entertainment trade newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Billy Wilkerson| url=https://www.onlinenevada.org/articles/billy-wilkerson| accessdate=October 8, 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613042436/http://www.onlinenevada.org/articles/billy-wilkerson| archivedate=June 13, 2014| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition appeared on September 3, 1930 and featured Wilkerson's front-page "Tradeviews" column, which became influential. The newspaper appeared Monday to Saturday for the first 10 years, except for a brief period, then Monday to Friday from 1940. Wilkerson ran the ''THR'' until his death in September 1962, although his final column appeared 18 months prior.&lt;ref name=Littleton17March2005&gt;{{cite news| last1=Littleton| first1=Cynthia| last2=Byrge| first2=Duane |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com:80/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000845237 |title=Paper Tale |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=March 17, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009101949/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000845237 |archivedate=October 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hollywood blacklist===
{{further|Hollywood blacklist}}

From the late 1930s, Wilkerson used ''THR'' to push the view that the industry was a communist stronghold. In particular, he opposed the screenplay writers' trade union, the [[Screen Writers Guild]], which he called the "Red Beachhead."&lt;ref name="Baum"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/blacklist-thr-addresses-role-65-391931|title=The Hollywood Reporter, After 65 Years, Addresses Role in Blacklist| last1=Baum| first1=Gary| first2=Daniel | last2=Miller | date=November 19, 2012| work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holley |first=Val |title=Mike Connolly and the Manly Art of Hollywood Gossip |year=2007 | page=105 | isbn=978-0-7864-1552-6 |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, N.C.| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mike_Connolly_and_the_Manly_Art_of_Holly.html?id=tw-41V4RQjEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 the Guild considered creating an American Authors' Authority to hold copyright for writers, instead of ownership passing to the studios. Wilkerson devoted his "Tradeviews" column to the issue on July 29, 1946, headlined "A Vote for Joe Stalin." He went to [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]] before publishing it, knowing the damage it would cause, but was apparently encouraged by the priest to go ahead with it.&lt;ref name=Baum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilkerson |first=William |author-link=William Wilkerson |publication-date=July 29, 1946 |title=A Vote For Joe Stalin |periodical=The Hollywood Reporter |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The column contained the first industry names, including [[Dalton Trumbo]] and [[Howard E. Koch|Howard Koch]], on what became the Hollywood blacklist, known as "Billy's list." Eight of the 11 people Wilkerson named were among the "[[Hollywood Ten]]" who were [[blacklist]]ed after hearings in 1947 by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].&lt;ref name="Baum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Jerry (2010). ''The Complete History of American Film Criticism'', Santa Monica Press, p.&amp;nbsp;85.&lt;/ref&gt; When Wilkerson died, his ''THR'' obituary said that he had "named names, pseudonyms and card numbers and was widely credited with being chiefly responsible for preventing communists from becoming entrenched in Hollywood production."&lt;ref name=Baum/&gt;

In 1997, ''THR'' reporter David Robb wrote a story about the newspaper's involvement, but the editor, Robert J. Dowling, declined to run it. For the blacklist's 65th anniversary in 2012, the ''THR'' published a lengthy investigative piece about Wilkerson's role, by reporters Gary Baum and Daniel Miller.&lt;ref name="Baum"/&gt; The same edition carried an apology from Wilkerson's son W. R. Wilkerson III. He wrote that his father had been motivated by revenge for his thwarted ambition to own a studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/blacklist-billy-wilkersons-son-apologizes-391977| title=An Apology: The Son of THR Founder Billy Wilkerson on the Publication's Dark Past| last=Wilkerson III| first=W.

Wilkerson's wife, [[Tichi Wilkerson Kassel]] (1926–2004), took over as publisher and editor-in-chief when her husband died. She sold the paper on April 11, 1988, to Affiliated Publications, parent company of Billboard Publications, for $26.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=A.

Dowling became ''THR'' president in 1988 and editor-in-chief and publisher in 1991.&lt;ref name=Littleton17March2005/&gt;

Dowling hired Alex Ben Block as editor in 1990, and editorial quality of both news and specials steadily improved. Block and Teri Ritzer dampened much of the rah-rah coverage and [[cronyism]] that had infected the paper under Wilkerson.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} After Block left, former ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' film editor, Anita Busch, was became editor between 1999 and 2001. Busch was credited with making the paper competitive with ''Variety''. Tony Uphoff assumed the publisher position in November 2005.  In March 2006, a private equity consortium led by Blackstone and KKR, both with ties to the conservative movement in the United States, acquired ''The Reporter'' along with the other assets of [[Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen]] (VNU) which purchased Affiliated Publications in 1994.&lt;ref name=Folio24June2004/&gt;  It joined those publications with ''AdWeek'' and [[A.C.

In December 2009, Prometheus Global Media, a newly formed company formed by Pluribus Capital Management and [[Guggenheim Partners]] and chaired by Jimmy Finkelstein, CEO of News Communications, parent of political journal ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', acquired ''The Hollywood Reporter'' from Nielsen Business Media. It pledged to invest in the brand and grow the company. Richard Beckman, formerly of [[Condé Nast]], was appointed the new company's CEO.

In April 2007, industry veteran Eric Mika was named to the newly created role of Senior Vice President, Publishing Director of ''The Reporter''. Having previously served as Senior Vice President and Managing Director of Nielsen Business Media's Film and Performing Arts Group and, before that, as Vice President and Managing Director for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Mika assumed responsibility for the general management of sales, marketing and editorial for ''The Hollywood Reporter'', as well as the brand's ancillary products, events, licensing business and partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Eric Mika Appointed to Boost THR| url=https://www.minonline.com/eric-mika-appointed-to-boost-thr/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905093048/http://www.minonline.com/eric-mika-appointed-to-boost-thr/| dead-url=yes| archive-date=September 5, 2017| date=April 30, 2007| work=Min| accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, Rose Einstein, former Vice President, Advertising Sales for [[Netflix]] and 25-year veteran of Reed Business Media, was named to the newly created role of Vice President, Associate Publisher to oversee all sales and business development for ''The Reporter''.

In July 2007, ''THR'' named Elizabeth Guider as its new editor. An 18-year veteran of ''Variety'', where she served as Executive Editor, Guider assumed responsibility for the editorial vision and strategic direction of ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s daily and weekly editions, digital content offerings and executive conferences. After nearly running the publication into the ground, Guider left ''The Hollywood Reporter'' in early 2010.&lt;ref name=H411&gt;{{cite news| title=The Hollywood Reporter Sheds Editor, Heads to Tabloid Land| url=https://www.showbiz411.com/2010/10/11/the-hollywood-reporter-sheds-editor-heads-to-tabloid-land| first=Roger| last=Friedman| date=October 11, 2010| work=[[Hollywood 411]]| accessdate=September 4, 2017| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905094750/http://www.showbiz411.com/2010/10/11/the-hollywood-reporter-sheds-editor-heads-to-tabloid-land| archivedate=September 5, 2017| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
===Print===
The weekly print edition of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' includes profiles, original photography and interviews with entertainment figures; articles about major upcoming releases and product launches; film reviews and [[film festival]] previews; coverage of the latest industry deals, TV ratings, box-office figures and analysis of global entertainment business trends and indicators; photos essays and reports from premieres and other red-carpet events; and the latest on Hollywood fashion and lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===On the web===
The ''Reporter'' published a primitive "[[satellite]]" [[Digital data|digital]] edition in the late 1980s. It became the first daily entertainment trade paper to start a website in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Clinard| first=Josh| title=Covering the entertainment biz: Hollywood Reporter vs. Variety| url=http://sabew.org/2012/05/covering-the-entertainment-biz-hollywood-reporter-vs-variety/| publisher=[[Society of American Business Editors and Writers]]| accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the site offered free news briefs with complete coverage firewalled as a premium paid service. In later years, the website became mostly free as it became more reliant on ad sales and less on subscribers. The website had already gone through a redesign by the time competitor ''Variety'' took to the web in 1998. In 2002, the ''Reporter''{{'}}s website won the Jesse H. Neal Award for business journalism. In November 2013, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' launched the style site Pret-a-Reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The Hollywood Reporter Launches New Style Website Pret-A-Reporter| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/thr-launches-pret-a-reporter-655564| work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=November 13, 2013| accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editors and reporters==
''The Hollywood Reporter'' has a staff of roughly 150. In addition to hiring Eric Mika, Rose Eintstein and Elizabeth Guider, the ''Reporter'' hired the following staff in 2007:

* Todd Cunningham, former assistant managing editor of the ''[[LA Business Journal]]'', as National Editor for ''The Hollywood Reporter'': Premier Edition
* Steven Zeitchik as Senior Writer, based in New York, where he provide news analysis and features for the Premiere Edition
* Melissa Grego, former managing editor of ''[[TV Week]]'', as Editor of HollywoodReporter.com
* Jonathan Landreth as the new Asian bureau chief, in addition to 13 new writers across Asia

However, staffing levels began to drop again in 2008. In April, Nielsen Business Media eliminated between 40 and 50 editorial staff positions at ''The Hollywood Reporter'' and its sister publications: ''Adweek'', ''Brandweek'', ''Editor &amp; Publisher'' and ''Mediaweek.''&lt;ref name="PaidContent"&gt;{{cite news| title=Nielsen Business Media Lays Off Between 40-50; Mainly Editorial| first=Rafat| last=Ali| date=April 10, 2008| url=http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-nielsen-business-media-lays-off-between-40-50-mainly-editorial| publisher= [[Gigaom]]| accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, another 12 editorial positions were cut at the trade paper.&lt;ref name="DeadlineHollywood"&gt;{{cite news|

With the entertainment industry as a whole shrinking, "Hollywood studios have cut more than $20 million from the Motion Picture Association of America budget this year. The resulting staff and program reductions are expected to permanently shrink the scope and size of the six-studio trade and advocacy group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUKTRE5220TJ20090303| publisher=[[Reuters]]| title=Hollywood studios' trade group faces leaner budget| date=March 3, 2009| first=Carl| last=DiOrio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staffing at ''THR'' in 2008 saw even further cutbacks with "names from today's tragic bloodletting of ''The Hollywood Reporter'''s staff" adding up quickly in the hard economic times at the end of 2008.&lt;ref name="deadlinehollywooddaily.com"&gt;{{cite web| first=Nikki| last=Finke| url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/layoffs-at-hollywood-reporter-12-the-staff/ |title=UPDATE: Layoffs Gut Hollywood Reporter; Variety's Stylephile Victim Of Recession |website=Deadline Hollywood| date=December 4, 2008| accessdate=May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The trade has not only been thin, but only publishing digital version 19 days this holiday season. Film writers Leslie Simmons, Carolyn Giardina, Gregg Goldstein, plus lead TV critic Barry Garron and TV reporter Kimberly Nordyke, also special issues editor Randee Dawn Cohen out of New York and managing editor Harley Lond and international department editor [[Hy Hollinger]], plus Dan Evans, Lesley Goldberg, Michelle Belaski, James Gonzalez were among those chopped from the masthead."&lt;ref name="deadlinehollywooddaily.com"/&gt;

When [[Janice Min]] and Lori Burgess came on board in 2010, the editorial and sales staff increased nearly 50%, respectively. Min hired various recognized journalists in the entertainment industry, most notably ''Variety'' film critic [[Todd McCarthy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/todd-mccarthy-joins-hollywood-reporter-21514/|title=Todd McCarthy Joins The Hollywood Reporter|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after his firing from ''Variety'' in March 2010, as well as Kim Masters of NPR, Tim Goodman of the [[San Francisco Chronicle|''San Francisco Chronicle'']], Lacey Rose of ''Forbes'', and Pamela McClintock of ''Variety''.

==2010 relaunch==
The 2010 relaunch of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' under then-CEO [[Richard Beckman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.minonline.com/most-intriguing-a-marquee-year-for-richard-beckman-in-2011/| title=Most Intriguing: A Marquee Year for Richard Beckman in 2011?| date=November 22, 2010| newspaper=min Online| access-date=2016-12-09| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116015939/http://www.minonline.com/most-intriguing-a-marquee-year-for-richard-beckman-in-2011/| archivedate=November 16, 2016| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was closely chronicled by the national media. After purchasing THR from Guggenheim Partners and Pluribus Capital in 2010, Beckman recruited Min, the former editor-in-chief of [[Us Weekly]], to "eviscerate" the existing daily trade paper and reinvent it as a glossy, large-format weekly magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Barnes| first=Brooks| title=Hollywood Reporter to Become a Weekly Magazine| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/business/media/13hollywood.html?pagewanted=all| work=The New York Times| accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Reporter'' relaunched with a weekly print edition and a revamped website that enabled it to break news. Eight months after its initial report, ''[[The New York Times]]'' took note of the many scoops ''THR'' had generated, adding that the new glossy format seemed to be succeeding with its "rarefied demographic". "They managed to change the subject by going weekly… The large photos, lush paper stock and great design are a kind of narcotic here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Carr| first=David| title=An Outsider Making Waves in Hollywood| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/30/business/media/30carr.html?pagewanted=all| work=The New York Times| accessdate=October 11, 2013| date=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 2013, the ''Times'' returned to ''THR'', filing a report on a party for [[Academy Award]] nominees the magazine had hosted at the Los Angeles restaurant [[Spago]]. Noting the crowd of top celebrities in attendance, the ''Times'' alluded to the fact that many [[Hollywood]] insiders were now referring to ''THR'' as "the new ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''". Ad sales since Min's hiring were up more than 50%, while traffic to the magazine's website had grown by 800%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Barnes| first=Brooks| title=From Has-Been to Life of the Party| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/fashion/the-hollywood-reporter-dusts-off-its-party-clothes.html| work=The New York Times| accessdate=October 11, 2013| date=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits with competitors==
In 1932, ''Variety,'' who at the time were only based in New York publishing weekly, sued ''The Hollywood Reporter'' for alleged plagiarism for $46,500 accusing them of copying their reporting by phoning or wiring the information to Hollywood after the publication of ''Variety'' in New York on Tuesdays so that they could publish the information before ''Variety'' reached Hollywood on Fridays.&lt;ref name="Variety1932"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/variety105-1932-01#page/n1/mode/1up|title='Variety' Charges Hollywood Daily of Stealing Its News Each Week|date=January 5, 1932|work=Variety|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', a property of [[Penske Media Corporation]], now the owner of ''Variety'', sued ''The Hollywood Reporter'' for more than $5 million, alleging [[copyright infringement]]. In 2013, ''THR''{{'}}s parent company settled the suit. According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', "The lawsuit [was] widely viewed in Hollywood as a proxy for the bitter war for readers and advertising dollars... The two sides agreed on a statement reading in part: 'Prometheus admits that ''The Hollywood Reporter'' copied source code from Penske Media Corporation's Web site www.tvline.com; Prometheus and ''The Hollywood Reporter'' have apologized to Penske Media.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Owners of Competing Hollywood Publications Settle Copyright Lawsuit| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324685104578390833241825180| work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| accessdate=October 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status and legacy==
''The Hollywood Reporter'' published out of the same offices on [[Sunset Boulevard]] for more than a half century. Today, the offices are located in [[L.A.]]'s [[Mid-Wilshire]] district.

''The Hollywood Reporter'' sponsors and hosts a number of major industry events and awards ceremonies. It hosted 13 such events in 2012, including the Women in Entertainment Breakfast, where it announced its annual [[Power 100]] list of the industry's most powerful women;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Cadenas| first=Kerensa| title=Diane Keaton to be Honored with Sherry Lansing Leadership Award| url=https://blogs.indiewire.com/womenandhollywood/diane-keaton-honored-with-sherry-lansing-leadership-award| publisher=[[IndieWire]]| accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Key Art Awards]] (for achievement in entertainment advertising and communications); Power Lawyers Breakfast; Next Gen (honoring the industry's 50 fastest-rising stars and executives age 35 and under); Nominees Night; and the 25 Most Powerful Stylists Luncheon.

===Awards season===
Entertainment-industry awards receive ample coverage from ''The Hollywood Reporter'', both in print and online. The magazine handicaps all the races, profiles the contenders and analyzes the business impact of nominations and wins. THR awards analyst Scott Feinberg analyzes and predicts the [[Emmy]] and [[Academy Award|Oscar]] races (his weekly ''Feinberg Forecast'' is published from late August up to the Academy Awards [[broadcast]]). THR also offers special print editions, such as its annual Oscar and Emmy issues, during respective awards seasons. THR.com features The Race, an awards-coverage blog, which encompasses Race to the Oscars, an app dedicated to Academy Awards coverage for [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platforms.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Competition with ''Variety''===
''Variety'' was long established as a weekly entertainment trade paper based in New York City, initially covering [[vaudeville]] circles, [[Tin Pan Alley]] and in the city's [[Theater District]], but it was ''The Hollywood Reporter'' that began reporting the film business daily from Hollywood in 1930.

''Variety'' used to take three days to reach Hollywood and sued ''The Hollywood Reporter'' for alleged plagiarism in 1932 by taking advantage of the delay and difference in publication schedules&lt;ref name="Variety1932"/&gt; and eventually started its daily Hollywood edition, ''Daily Variety'', in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety111-1933-09#page/n91/mode/1up|title=Daily Variety on Coast}} Variety, September 12, 1933 p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1988 to 2014, ''Variety'' and ''The Hollywood Reporter'' were both located on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] along the well-trafficked [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles|Miracle Mile]]. Staffers often migrate between the papers.

''The Hollywood Reporter'' maintains a business association with the home entertainment trade publication ''[[Home Media Magazine]]'', which is owned by Questex Media Group. The alliance includes an exchange of stories when the need arises, and gives ''The Reporter'' access into the home entertainment trade, which ''Variety'' enjoyed with its former sister publication, the Reed-owned ''Video Business.''

In March 2007, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' surpassed ''Daily Variety'' to achieve the largest total distribution of any entertainment daily.&lt;ref&gt;ABC Publisher's Statement, as compared to Variety and Daily Variety, March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The NBC Mystery Movie''''' is the [[umbrella title]] of an [[United States|American]] television series produced by [[Universal Studios]], that was broadcast by [[NBC]] from 1971 to 1977. At times, it was divided into two versions that were broadcast concurrently during different nights of the week: ''The NBC Sunday Mystery Movie'' and ''The NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie''.

''The NBC Mystery Movie'' was a "[[wheel series|wheel show]]", or "umbrella program" that rotated several programs within the same time period throughout the season. For its initial 1971–72 season, it featured a rotation of three detective dramas that were broadcast on Wednesday nights for 90 minutes, from 8:30–10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. in the [[Eastern Time Zone]].

== Background ==
The origin of the "wheel" format was a joint programming and creative production agreement between the NBC Television Network and [[Universal Studios]] Television and Motion Pictures dating from 1966. By that agreement, NBC ordered a multi-year series of dramatic anthology productions from Universal which would be broadcast as NBC series television programming in the United States (both as originals and re-runs), while Universal retained the rights to overseas release of these products as feature-length films. Also, NBC would not offer these shows subsequently as TV re-runs for international sales.

The first series created under this agreement was ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]'', a drama with three rotating stars. It was followed by ''[[The Bold Ones]]'' and ''[[Four in One]]'' (the similar ''[[The Men (TV series)|The Men]]'' was produced for ABC and involved series from three studios, although one of them was Universal). While it was a long and profitable collaboration, it finally succumbed to the changes of the commercial broadcast market regarding both structure and content by the end of the decade.

By the late 1970s, the increasing popularity of situation comedies, coupled with their lower production costs and much greater scheduling flexibility and resale opportunities, surpassed that of these feature-length (90–120 minute) drama anthologies. The anthologies could not reasonably be reduced for shorter broadcast times for the re-run market. They were not designed for casual or short-term viewers, who would have little interest in the characters or the story of an individual episode. Each episode and each series were of widely varying quality, making package re-sale difficult. However, by the early 1980s, various movie episodes from the former ''Mystery Movie'' series were rebroadcast on late night's ''[[CBS Late Movie]]'' as a package with an earlier half-hour situation comedy series rerun. While they lasted, the best of them employed the finest actors, writers and production standards available.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

(photo minus his new hep trademark mustache) in ''[[McMillan &amp; Wife]]''.]]

=== Inaugural programs ===
The three original 1971–1972 season shows of ''The NBC Mystery Movie'' were:
* ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', starring [[Dennis Weaver]] as a rural [[Taos, New Mexico]] lawman temporarily assigned to the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD). Inspired by the [[Clint Eastwood]] 1968 film ''[[Coogan's Bluff]]'', the show debuted the previous season as part of the hour-long [[NBC]] wheel show ''[[Four in One]]''.
* ''[[Columbo]]'', starring [[Peter Falk]] as a deceptively bumbling [[Los Angeles]] homicide detective. The series was derived from a 1968 made-for-television movie, ''Prescription: Murder'', which starred Falk in the same role.
* ''[[McMillan &amp; Wife]]'', starring [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Susan Saint James]] as a husband-and-wife crime-fighting duo. Hudson's character was a hep sophisticated [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] city police commissioner. Saint James later left the series and it was renamed ''McMillan''.

The umbrella series was counted a great success in its first season and finished at number 14 in the [[Nielsen ratings]] for the 1971–1972 season. ''Columbo'' was nominated for eight [[Emmy Award]]s and won four categories. This success prompted [[NBC]] to move the series to the competitive 8:30-10:00 Sunday evening time period for the second season as ''The NBC Sunday Mystery Movie''.  In addition, a fourth show was added to the rotation, lasting two seasons (1972–1974):

*''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', starring [[Richard Boone]] as a gunfighter turned frontier [[Forensic science|forensic]] detective in the Old West. This piece of the wheel series was produced by [[Jack Webb]].

=== ''The NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie'' programs ===
==== Inaugural ====
NBC also launched a clone of the umbrella series, ''The NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie'', which debuted in the original time period and featured three new programs:
*''[[Banacek]]'', starring [[George Peppard]] as Thomas Banacek, a free-lance [[Polish Americans|Polish-American]] insurance investigator in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Like ''Hec Ramsey'', it lasted two seasons (1972–1974).
*''[[Cool Million]]'', starring [[James Farentino]] as a former CIA agent turned private investigator and security/retrieval expert whose fee per case was one million [[United States dollar|dollars]].
*''[[Madigan (TV series)|Madigan]]'' had [[Richard Widmark]] reprising his 1968 film role as a streetwise veteran detective of the New York City Police Department.

==== Subsequent ====
During the 1973–1974 season, the programs rotating on Sunday remained the same, while on Wednesday, ''Cool Million'' and ''Madigan'' were canceled and ''Banacek'' rotated with three new series:
*''[[Faraday &amp; Company]]'', starring [[Dan Dailey]] as a private detective who returns to Los Angeles after a quarter century in a South American jail.
*''[[Tenafly (TV series)|Tenafly]]'', starring [[James McEachin]] as an African-American private detective.
*''[[The Snoop Sisters]]'', starring [[Helen Hayes]] and [[Mildred Natwick]] as two elderly sisters who routinely found mysteries which they solved.

Rescheduling to Tuesday nights as ''The NBC Tuesday Mystery Movie'' during January 1974 was not enough to help boost ratings, and the midweek series was canceled. The Sunday series continued, anchored by the popular trio of ''Columbo'', ''McCloud'', and ''McMillan and Wife''.

=== Later changes ===
During subsequent years, these rotated with a fourth series, which changed each year (1972–1977), including:
*''[[Amy Prentiss]]'', starring [[Jessica Walter]] as the fictional first female chief of detectives for the San Francisco Police Department. This series was a spinoff of ''[[Ironside (1967 TV series)|Ironside]]''.
*''[[McCoy (TV series)|McCoy]]'', starring [[Tony Curtis]] as a professional con-man / thief.
*''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'', starring [[Jack Klugman]] as a medical examiner in the L.A. County Coroner's office.
*''[[Lanigan's Rabbi]]'', about a small town police chief ([[Art Carney]]) and his best friend, a rabbi and amateur sleuth ([[Bruce Solomon]]), based on [[Harry Kemelman]]'s popular Rabbi Small mysteries.

Of all the wheel series, only the original three&amp;nbsp;— ''Columbo'', ''McCloud'' and ''McMillan &amp; Wife''&amp;nbsp;— survived for the entire run of the ''Mystery Movie''. Most of the others were very short-lived, and, with the exception of ''Hec Ramsey'' and ''Banacek'', were all only on the air for one season. ''Quincy, M.E.'', which was the next to last new ''Mystery Movie'' series to premiere, ended up outlasting the parent series itself; midway through the final ''Mystery Movie'' season, ''Quincy'' was taken out of the wheel lineup and retooled into a one-hour weekly series that ran for seven more seasons, coming to an end in 1983.

Although the ''Mystery Movie'' series was cancelled at the end of the 1976–1977 season, NBC kept ''Columbo'' in production and a seventh season consisting of five films premiered on November 21, 1977. After the fifth film aired in May 1978, NBC cancelled ''Columbo'' as well.

== Presentation ==
The ''Mystery Movie'' theme music was composed by [[Henry Mancini]].

The opening credits consisted of a shadowed figure carrying a flashlight slowly walking toward the camera in a desert landscape under dramatically lit clouds, as images of the various rotating series appeared sequentially on the screen; at the end, an announcer (Hank Sims) presented the night's main actors and series ''(example: "tonight, starring Peter Falk as '''Columbo'''")''. Some [[television syndication|syndicated]] episodes of ''Columbo'' retain this opening credit sequence, though slowed toward the end to avoid showing the title caption which includes "NBC" and (after the first season), a day of the week.

The ''Wednesday Mystery Movie'' theme was composed by [[Quincy Jones]] for its first season and had an animated open to show the lineup.

&lt;!-- [[ABC Mystery Movie]] links directly to this section --&gt;
In 1989, Universal Television{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] teamed to launch a revival of the mystery wheel, titled the '''''ABC Monday Mystery Movie'''''. The network brought back original ''Mystery Movie'' series ''Columbo'' to be part of the wheel, with Peter Falk returning in the title role. Two new series joined Columbo in its first year, ''[[Gideon Oliver]]'', starring [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as a crime solving anthropologist, and ''[[B.L. Stryker]]'', which featured [[Burt Reynolds]] as a [[South Florida]] private investigator.

Columbo continued in its second season on Saturday (as ''ABC Saturday Mystery Movie'') with two other films series in August 1990. The new ''[[Christine Cromwell]]'', a [[San Francisco]] based mystery starring [[Jaclyn Smith]]. The wheel was completed with a revival of CBS' 1970s crime drama ''[[Kojak]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Tim|last2=Marsh|first2=Earle F.|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present|date=2009|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9780307483201|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8KztFy6QYwC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;ots=Asf_KDcqnH&amp;dq=ABC%20Mystery%20Movies%20news&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=ABC%20Mystery%20Movies%20news&amp;f=false|accessdate=February 3, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wheel series ran irregularly from February 1989 until August 1990. After the series ended, ABC kept ''Columbo'' in production and Falk starred in an additional fourteen films before the network discontinued the series in 2003.

NBC, meanwhile, brought ''McCloud'' back for a reunion film in 1989. The film, titled "The Return of Sam McCloud", featured Dennis Weaver in the role of United States Senator Sam McCloud.

===Friday Night Mystery===
In the fall of 1993, NBC made an attempt to revive the wheel format, this time called ''The NBC Friday Night Mystery''. As originally conceived, this rotation was supposed to include:&lt;ref name=mcall&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawler|first1=Sylvia|title=Nbc Aims To Reverse The Trend|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1993-05-23/entertainment/2916286_1_peacock-network-nbc-president-bob-wright-nbc-s-west-coast-president/2|page=2|accessdate=February 2, 2018|work=The Morning Call|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=May 23, 1993|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The cast of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' would often make a recurring joke ("It's ''The NBC Mystery Movie''!") whenever a character in a movie shone a flashlight. Eventually, at the beginning of the episode "''Teenagers from Outer Space''", Joel has the robots in electrical shock therapy to try and break them of the habit.
* A 2008 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[Dial 'N' for Nerder]]", ended with a reference to the ''NBC Mystery Movie'' opening sequence, featuring [[Nelson Muntz]] as Columbo, [[Dr. Hibbert]] as Quincy, [[Rich Texan]] as McCloud and Mr. Burns and Smithers as McMillan and Wife.
* In an episode of the cartoon ''[[King of the Hill]]'', [[Hank Hill]] refers to Hec Ramsey as an under-appreciated part of the ''NBC Mystery Wheel''.

'''''Which Lie Did I Tell?: More Adventures in the Screen Trade''''' is a work of [[non-fiction]] first published in 2000 by [[novelist]] and [[screenwriter]] [[William Goldman]]. It is the follow-up to his 1982 book ''[[Adventures in the Screen Trade]]''.

Originally to be called ''The Big Campfire'', the inspiration for the title came when Goldman was in the office of a [[Hollywood]] [[Film producer|producer]] who was talking on the phone to one of his associates. Suddenly he cupped his hands over the receiver, snapped his fingers and said “Bill, Bill! Which lie did I tell?”

==Contents==
The book begins with more stories about movies he has been involved with, starting with the period from 1982—when ''[[Adventures in the Screen Trade]]'' was published—to 1986 when he received no movie work. Goldman then tells the unfortunate story of how he became mixed up in ''[[Memoirs of an Invisible Man]]'', before the saving grace of ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' brought him his first screen credit in nearly nine years. Other adventures are ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'', ''[[The Year of the Comet]]'' (which he uses as an example of how a movie can become a failure at the script level), ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]'' (which he uses as an example of the principle that the best scene sometimes needs to be cut), ''[[The Ghost and the Darkness]]'' (which he uses as an example of how ego can hinder a film's production and artistic integrity) and ''[[Absolute Power (film)|Absolute Power]]'' (which he uses as an example to illustrate why a movie does not have to be faithful to the book on which it is based). Two films he does not cover are ''[[Heat (1987 film)|Heat]]'' (for legal reasons) and ''[[The Chamber (1996 film)|The Chamber]]'' (because it was not remotely interesting).

The next part of the book has Goldman analyzing scenes from various [[screenplay]]s he admires including ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[North by Northwest]]'' and ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.

The next section covers how he gets movie ideas, and details four examples and why he didn't pursue them.

"The Old Guy," inspired by the true story about an elderly criminal (recently made into a 2018 movie, [[The Old Man and the Gun|''The Old Man and The Gun,'']] apparently without Goldman's participation). Goldman learned of the story in an [https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Last-of-Rub-a-Dub-Dub-Fugitives-Florida-cops-2934028.php April 1999 article] in the San Francisco Chronicle.

"The Good Guy," an original story idea linking characters in the Littleton, Colorado school shooting and the JonBenet Ramsey murder, which took place in Boulder, CO.
"The Mastermind," expanding on the actual 1911 theft of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' painting, partially based on Seymour Reit's book ''The Day They Stole The Mona Lisa''.

"The Dolphin," inspired by a New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/17/us/autism-no-handicap-boy-defies-swamp.html article] about an autistic 10 year-old boy surviving four days lost in an alligator and snake infested Florida swamp.

The final section is an original screenplay where he examines the writing process and asks other famous screenwriters for their opinions.

In between chapters are various musings on a range of topics from why not to open a script with a courtroom scene to how he sets about adapting a book. Some of these snippets offer an insight into Goldman's background that was not in the first book—such as his relationship with his parents, his university life and time in the military—the book thereby shading into [[autobiography]].&lt;ref&gt;'BOOKS OF THE TIMES: TOP HOLLYWOOD SCRIBE TELLS ALL. REALLY. HONEST.' Lehmann-Haupt, Christopher. ''New York Times'' (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 09 Mar 2000: E9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapters on ''The Princess Bride'', ''Misery'', ''Maverick'' and ''The Ghost and the Darkness'' originally appeared in his books ''Four Screenplays'' and ''Five Screenplays'' and in the published [[shooting script]] for ''The Ghost and the Darkness''.

==Reviews==
Michael Sragow describes ''Which Lie Did I Tell? (More Adventures in the Screen Trade)'': "In addition to brief descriptions of topics like ''spitballing'' (brainstorming story notions) and expansions or reprints of behind-the-scenes stories already published as introductions to Goldman's screenplays, it contains famous scenes from other writers' screenplays; how-to advice on judging ideas, on turning ideas into stories and on writing them in a way that hooks the attention of a director or a star; and a partial draft of a script, with reactions from esteemed peers."&lt;ref name = "Sragow" /&gt; ''[[School Library Journal]]'' wrote about ''Which Lie Did I Tell?'', "From ''[[Memoirs of an Invisible Man|The Memoirs of an Invisible Man]]'' to ''[[Absolute Power (film)|Absolute Power]]'', this master storyteller explains his role and his thought processes for each film, at the same time delivering an exposition on how stories are written and films are made. Sprinkled throughout is his advice for future screenwriters. In the second section, he analyzes classic film sequences, setting each scene, quoting excerpts from the screenplays, and then explaining what made them great. Finally, the author offers story ideas and examines their potential for the big screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Drabkin | first = Jane S. |title = Which Lie Did I Tell: More Adventures in the Screen Trade | journal= [[School Library Journal]]| volume= 46 | issue = 9 |date= Sep 2000 |page= 260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sragow"&gt;{{cite news | last= Sragow | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Sragow | title = Famous Screenwriter's School: William Goldman on how to succeed in movies and still be ticked off | work = [[The New York Times]] | publisher = [[The New York Times Company]] | date = April 9, 2000 | url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/04/09/reviews/000409.09sragowt.html | accessdate= February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
