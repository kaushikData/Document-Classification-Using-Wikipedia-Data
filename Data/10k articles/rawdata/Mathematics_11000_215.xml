'''133''' ('''one hundred [and] thirty-three''') is the [[natural number]] following [[132 (number)|132]] and preceding [[134 (number)|134]].

==In mathematics==
'''133''' is an ''n'' whose divisors (excluding ''n'' itself) added up divide [[Euler's totient function|φ(''n'')]]. It is an [[octagonal number]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000567|title=Sloane's A000567 : Octagonal numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Harshad number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005349|title=Sloane's A005349 : Niven (or Harshad) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a [[happy number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A007770|title=Sloane's A007770 : Happy numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

133 is a [[repdigit]] in [[undecimal|base 11]] (111) and base 18 (77), whilst in [[vigesimal|base 20]] it is a [[cyclic number]] formed from the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of [[3 (number)|the number three]].

133 is a [[semiprime]]: a product of two [[prime number]]s, namely 7 and 19. Since those prime factors are [[Gaussian prime]]s, this means that 133 is a [[Blum integer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3364">In [[statistics]], the '''antithetic variates''' method is a [[variance reduction]] technique used in [[Monte Carlo methods]]. Considering that the error reduction in the simulated signal (using [[Monte Carlo methods]]) has a [[square root]] [[limit of a sequence|convergence]], a very large number of [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] paths is required to obtain an accurate result. The antithetic variates method reduces the variance of the simulation results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kroese|first1=D. P.|last2=Taimre|first2=T.|last3=Botev|first3=Z. I.|title=Handbook of Monte Carlo methods|year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}(Chapter 9.3)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underlying principle==

The antithetic variates technique consists, for every sample path obtained, in taking its antithetic path &amp;mdash; that is given a path &lt;math&gt;\{\varepsilon_1,\dots,\varepsilon_M\}&lt;/math&gt; to also take &lt;math&gt;\{-\varepsilon_1,\dots,-\varepsilon_M\}&lt;/math&gt;. The advantage of this technique is twofold: it reduces the number of [[Normal distribution|normal]] samples to be taken to generate ''N'' paths, and it reduces the [[variance]] of the sample paths, improving the accuracy.

Suppose that we would like to estimate 
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \mathrm{E}( h(X) ) = \mathrm{E}( Y ) \, &lt;/math&gt;

For that we have generated two samples

:&lt;math&gt;Y_1\text{ and }Y_2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

An unbiased estimate of &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\hat \theta = \frac{\hat \theta_1 + \hat \theta_2}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

And 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Var}(\hat \theta) = \frac{\text{Var}(Y_1) + \text{Var}(Y_2) + 2\text{Cov}(Y_1,Y_2)}{4} &lt;/math&gt;

so variance is reduced if &lt;math&gt;Cov(Y_1,Y_2)&lt;/math&gt; is negative.

==Example 1==

If the law of the variable ''X'' follows a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] along [0,&amp;nbsp;1], the first sample will be   &lt;math&gt;u_1, \ldots, u_n&lt;/math&gt;,  where, for any given ''i'', &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from ''U''(0,&amp;nbsp;1). The second sample is built from   &lt;math&gt;u'_1, \ldots, u'_n&lt;/math&gt;,  where, for any given ''i'': &lt;math&gt;u'_i = 1-u_i&lt;/math&gt;.   If the set &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; is uniform along [0,&amp;nbsp;1], so are &lt;math&gt;u'_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Furthermore, covariance is negative, allowing for initial variance reduction.

==Example 2: integral calculation==

We would like to estimate
:&lt;math&gt;I = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{1+x} \, \mathrm{d}x.&lt;/math&gt;

The exact result is   &lt;math&gt;I=\ln 2 \approx 0.69314718&lt;/math&gt;.  This integral can be seen as the expected value of  &lt;math&gt;f(U)&lt;/math&gt;,  where

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{1}{1+x}&lt;/math&gt;

and ''U'' follows a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1].

The following table compares the classical Monte Carlo estimate (sample size: 2''n'', where ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1500) to  the antithetic variates estimate (sample size: ''n'', completed with the transformed sample 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;):

:{| cellspacing="1" border="1"

| align="right" | '''Estimate'''

|-
| ''Antithetic Variates ''
| align="right" | 0.69399
| align="right" | 0.00063
|}

The use of the antithetic variates method to estimate the result shows an important variance reduction.

An '''aperture card''' is a type of [[punched card]] with a cut-out window into which a chip of [[microform|microfilm]] is mounted.  Such a card is used for [[archive|archiving]] or for making multiple inexpensive copies of a document for ease of distribution.  The card is typically punched with machine-readable [[metadata]] associated with the microfilm image, and printed across the top of the card for visual identification; it may also be punched by hand in the form of an [[edge-notched card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cady |first=Susan A. |chapter=Microfilm technology and information systems |editor1-last=Bowden |editor1-first=Mary Ellen |editor2-last=Hahn |editor2-first=Trudi Bellardo |editor3-last=Williams |editor3-first=Robert Virgil |date=1999 |title=Proceedings of the 1998 Conference on the History and Heritage of Science Information Systems |series=ASIS monograph series |location=Medford, NJ |publisher=Published for the [[American Society for Information Science]] and the [[Chemical Heritage Foundation]] by [[Information Today]] |pages=177–186 |isbn=1573870803 |oclc=42022214 |chapterurl=https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.3796&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=189 |quote=Early aperture cards were sometimes mounted on McBee Keysort cards that could be notched on the margins to indicate an index term and then sorted manually with tools resembling knitting needles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The microfilm chip is most commonly 35mm in height, and contains an [[optics|optically reduced]] image, usually of some type of reference document, such as an [[engineering drawing]], that is the focus of the archiving process.  Machinery exists to automatically store, retrieve, sort, duplicate, create, and digitize cards with a high level of automation.

Aperture cards have several advantages and disadvantages when compared to digital systems.  While many aperture cards still play an important role in archiving, their role is gradually being replaced by digital systems.

== Usage ==
Aperture cards are used for engineering drawings from all engineering disciplines.  The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] once made extensive use of aperture cards, and some are still in use, but most data is now digital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060530111716/http://federalvoice.dscc.dla.mil/federalvoice/030924/tech.html Federal use of aperture cards (Archived Copy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about the drawing, for example the drawing number, could be both punched and printed on the remainder of the card.  With the proper machinery, this allows for automated handling.  In the absence of such machinery, the cards can still be read by a human with a lens and a light source.

=== Advantages ===
Aperture cards have, for archival purposes, some advantages over digital systems.  They have a 500-year lifetime, they are human readable, and there is no expense or risk in converting from one digital format to the next when computer systems become obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ed |last=LoTurco |title=The Engineering Aperture Card: Still Active, Still Vital |publisher=EDM Consultants |date=January 2004 |url=http://www.aiimne.org/library/LoTurcoWhitePaper1.pdf |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128162738/http://www.aiimne.org/library/LoTurcoWhitePaper1.pdf |archivedate=November 28, 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disadvantages ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
Most of the disadvantages are related to the well established differences in analog and digital technology. In particular, searching for given strings within content is considerably slower.  Handling physical cards requires proprietary machinery and processing optical film takes significant time.

The very nature of microfilm cameras and the high contrast properties of microfilm stock itself also impose limits on the amount of detail that can be resolved particularly at the higher reduction ratios (36x or greater) needed to film larger drawings. Faded drawings or those of low or uneven contrast do not reproduce well and significant detail or annotations may be lost.

In common with other forms of microfilm mis-filing cards after use, particularly in large archives, results in the card being for all intents and purposes lost forever unless it's later found by accident.

Aperture cards created from 35mm roll film mounted on to blank cards have to be treated with great care. Bending the card can cause the film to detach and excessive pressure to a stack of cards can cause the mounting glue to ooze creating clumps of cards which will feed through duplicators and other machinery either poorly or not at all. Feeding a de-laminated card through machinery not only risks destroying the image it also risks jamming or damaging the machinery.

== Machinery ==
A set of cards could be rapidly sorted by drawing number or other punched data using a [[card sorter]].  Machines are now available that [[Image scanner|scan]] aperture cards and produce a digital version.&lt;ref&gt;For example, this aperture card scanner from  [http://www.oceusa.com/main/product_detail.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=1408474395186237&amp;PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524441761057 Oce']&lt;/ref&gt;  Aperture card plotters are machines that use a laser to create the image on the film.&lt;ref&gt;For example, this aperture card plotter from [http://www.wwl.co.uk/apertureplotters.htm Wicks &amp; Wilson] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627060408/http://www.wwl.co.uk/apertureplotters.htm |date=June 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conversion ==
Aperture cards can be converted to digital documents using scanning equipment and software. Scanning can allow for significant image cleanup and enhancement. Often, the digital image produced is better than the visual quality available prescan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant|first1=Joe|title=Aperture Card Scanning|url=http://www.microcomseattle.com/solutions/document-scanning/aperture-card/|website=Micro Com Seattle|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15479">{{numeral systems}}

'''Bijective numeration''' is any [[numeral system]] in which every non-negative [[integer]] can be represented in exactly one way using a finite [[string of digits]]. The name derives from this [[bijection]] (one-to-one correspondence) between the set of non-negative integers and the set of finite strings using a finite set of symbols (the "digits").

Most ordinary numeral systems, such as the common [[decimal]] system, are not bijective because more than one string of digits can represent the same positive integer. In particular, adding [[leading zero]]es does not change the value represented, so "1", "01" and "001" all represent the number [[1 (number)|one]]. Even though only the first is usual, the fact that the others are possible means that decimal is not bijective. However, [[unary numeral system|unary]], with only one digit, ''is'' bijective.

A '''bijective [[radix|base]]-''k'' numeration''' is a bijective [[positional notation]]. It uses a string of digits from the set {1, 2, ..., ''k''} (where ''k'' ≥ 1) to encode each positive integer; a digit's position in the string defines its value as a multiple of a power of ''k''.  {{harvtxt|Smullyan|1961}} calls this notation ''k''-adic, but it should not be confused with the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]]: bijective numerals are a system for representing ordinary [[integer]]s by finite strings of nonzero digits, whereas the ''p''-adic numbers are a system of mathematical values that contain the integers as a subset and may need infinite sequences of digits in any numerical representation.

==Definition==
The [[radix|base-''k'']] bijective numeration system uses the digit-set {1, 2, ..., ''k''} (''k'' ≥ 1) to uniquely represent every non-negative integer, as follows:

* The integer zero is represented by the [[Empty_string|''empty string'']].
* The integer represented by the nonempty digit-string

::{{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}
:is
::{{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''k''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''k''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

* The digit-string representing the integer ''m'' &amp;gt; 0 is
::{{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}

:where

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a_0 &amp; = m   - q_0 k , &amp; q_0 &amp; = f\left(\frac m   k \right) &amp; \\
a_1 &amp; = q_0 - q_1 k , &amp; q_1 &amp; = f\left(\frac {q_0} k \right) &amp; \\
a_2 &amp; = q_1 - q_2 k , &amp; q_2 &amp; = f\left(\frac {q_1} k \right) &amp; \\
    &amp; \,\,\,\vdots          &amp;     &amp; \,\,\,\vdots \\
a_n &amp; = q_{n-1} - 0 k , &amp; q_n &amp; = f\left(\frac {q_{n-1}} k \right) = 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
:and

::&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \lceil x \rceil - 1,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lceil x \rceil&lt;/math&gt; being the least integer not less than ''x'' (the [[ceiling function]]).
In contrast, standard [[positional notation]] can be defined with a similar recursive algorithm where 
::&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor, &lt;/math&gt;

==Properties of bijective base-''k'' numerals==

For a given base ''k'' ≥ 1,

* there are exactly ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; bijective base-''k'' numerals of length ''n'' ≥ 0.{{sfnp|Forslund|1995}}

* if ''k'' &amp;ge; 2, the number of digits in the bijective base-''k'' numeral representing a nonnegative integer ''n'' is [[Logarithm|&lt;math&gt;\lfloor \log_k ((n+1)(k - 1))\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How many digits are in the bijective base-k numeral for n? |url=https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/607856/how-many-digits-are-in-the-bijective-base-k-numeral-for-n |website=Stackexchange |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in contrast to [[Floor and ceiling functions#Number of digits|&lt;math&gt;\lfloor \log_k n\rfloor +1 \ (n &gt; 0)&lt;/math&gt;]] for ordinary base-''k'' numerals; if ''k'' = 1 (i.e., unary), then the number of digits is just ''n'';
* if ''k'' &amp;ge; 2, the bijective base-''k'' and ordinary base-''k'' numerals for a nonnegative integer ''n'' ''are identical'' if and only if the ordinary numeral does not contain the digit ''0'' (or, equivalently, the bijective numeral is neither the empty string nor contains the digit ''k'').
* a list of bijective base-''k'' numerals, in natural order of the integers represented, is automatically in [[shortlex order]] (shortest first, lexicographical within each length). Thus, using λ to denote the [[empty string]], the base 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, and 16 numerals are as follows (where the ordinary representations are listed for comparison):

==Examples==

:34152 (in bijective base-5) = 3×5&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 4×5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1×5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5×5&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 2×1 = 2427 (in decimal).

:119A (in bijective base-10, with "A" representing the digit value ten) = 1×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 1×10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 9×10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 10×1 = 1200 (in decimal).

:A typical alphabetic list with more than 26 elements is bijective, using the order of A, B, C...X, Y, Z, AA, AB, AC...ZX, ZY, ZZ, AAA, AAB, AAC...

==The bijective base-10 system==
The bijective base-10 system is a base [[10 (number)|ten]] positional [[numeral system]] that does not use a digit to represent [[0 (number)|zero]]. It instead has a digit to represent ten, such as ''A''.

As with conventional [[decimal]], each digit position represents a power of ten, so for example 123 is "one hundred, plus two tens, plus three units."  All [[positive integer]]s that are represented solely with non-zero digits in conventional decimal (such as 123) have the same representation in decimal without a zero. Those that use a zero must be rewritten, so for example 10 becomes A, conventional 20 becomes 1A, conventional 100 becomes 9A, conventional 101 becomes A1, conventional 302 becomes 2A2, conventional 1000 becomes 99A, conventional 1110 becomes AAA, conventional 2010 becomes 19AA, and so on.

[[Addition]] and [[multiplication]] in decimal without a zero are essentially the same as with conventional decimal, except that carries occur when a position exceeds ten, rather than when it exceeds nine.  So to calculate 643 + 759, there are twelve units (write 2 at the right and carry 1 to the tens), ten tens (write A with no need to carry to the hundreds), thirteen hundreds (write 3 and carry 1 to the thousands), and one thousand (write 1), to give the result 13A2 rather than the conventional 1402.

==The bijective base-26 system==
In the bijective base-26 system one may use the Latin alphabet letters "A" to "Z" to represent the 26 digit values [[1 (number)|one]] to [[26 (number)|twenty-six]]. (A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26)

With this choice of notation, the number sequence (starting from 1) begins A, B, C, ..., X, Y, Z, AA, AB, AC, ..., AX, AY, AZ, BA, BB, BC, ...

Each digit position represents a power of twenty-six, so for example, the numeral ABC represents the value {{nowrap|1 × 26&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 × 26&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 × 26&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}} = 731 in base 10.

Many [[spreadsheet]]s including [[Microsoft Excel]] use this system to assign labels to the columns of a spreadsheet, starting A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, ..., AZ, BA, ..., ZZ, AAA, etc. For instance, in Excel 2013, there can be up to 16384 columns, labeled from A to XFD.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Excel 2013 For Dummies|first=Greg|last=Harvey|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118550007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of this system is used to name [[Variable star designation|variable stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Cataclysmic Variable Stars - How and Why They Vary|series=Praxis Books in Astronomy and Space|first=Coel|last=Hellier|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=9781852332112|contribution=Appendix D: Variable star nomenclature|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5I-yLZ3oYxIC&amp;pg=PA197}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be applied to any problem where a systematic naming using letters is desired, while using the shortest possible strings.

==Historical notes==

The fact that every non-negative integer has a unique representation in bijective base-''k'' (''k'' ≥ 1) is a "[[mathematical folklore|folk theorem]]" that has been rediscovered many times.  Early instances are {{harvtxt|Foster|1947}} for the case ''k'' = 10, and {{harvtxt|Smullyan|1961}} and {{harvtxt|Böhm|1964}} for all ''k'' ≥ 1. Smullyan uses this system to provide a [[Gödel numbering]] of the strings of symbols in a logical system; Böhm uses these representations to perform computations in the programming language [[P′′]]. {{harvtxt|Knuth|1969}} mentions the special case of ''k'' = 10, and {{harvtxt|Salomaa|1973}} discusses the cases ''k'' ≥ 2.  {{harvtxt|Forslund|1995}} appears to be another rediscovery, and hypothesizes that if ancient numeration systems used bijective base-''k'', they might not be recognized as such in archaeological documents, due to general unfamiliarity with this system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7265">In [[mathematics]], the '''Bony–Brezis theorem''', due to the French mathematicians [[Jean-Michel Bony]] and [[Haïm Brezis]], gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a closed subset of a [[manifold]] to be invariant under the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] defined by a [[vector field]], namely at each point of the closed set the vector field must have non-positive inner product with any '''exterior normal vector''' to the set. A vector is an ''exterior normal'' at a point of the closed set if there is a real-valued continuously differentiable function maximized locally at the point with that vector as its derivative at the point. If the closed subset is a smooth submanifold with boundary, the condition states that the vector field should not point outside the subset at boundary points. The generalization to non-smooth subsets is important in the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s.

The theorem had in fact been previously discovered by [[Mitio Nagumo]] in 1942 and is also known as the '''Nagumo theorem'''.&lt;ref name=blanchini&gt;{{citation|title=Survey paper: Set invariance in control|first=Franco|last= Blanchini|journal=Automatica |volume= 35 |issue=11 |year= 1999|pages= 1747–1767| doi=10.1016/S0005-1098(99)00113-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
Let ''F'' be closed subset of a C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; manifold ''M'' and let ''X'' be a [[vector field]] on ''M'' which is [[Lipschitz continuous]]. The following conditions are equivalent:

*Any [[integral curve]] of ''X'' starting in ''F'' remains in ''F''.
* (''X''(''m''),''v'') ≤ 0 for any exterior normal vector ''v'' at a point ''m'' in ''F''.

==Proof==
Following {{harvtxt|Hörmander|1983}}, to prove that the first condition implies the second, let ''c''(''t'') be an integral curve with
''c''(0) = ''x'' in ''F'' and ''dc/dt''= ''X''(''c''). Let ''g'' have a local maximum on ''F'' at ''x''. Then ''g''(''c''(''t'')) ≤ ''g'' (''c''(0)) for ''t'' small and positive. Differentiating, this implies that ''g'' '(''x'')⋅''X''(''x'') ≤ 0.

To prove the reverse implication, since the result is local. it enough to check it in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. In that case ''X'' locally satisfies a Lipschitz condition

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{|X(a)-X(b)|\le C|a-b|.}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''F'' is closed, the distance function ''D''(''x'') = ''d''(''x'',''F'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has the following differentiability property:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{D(x+h)=D(x) + \min_{z} 2h\cdot(x-z)  + o(|h|),}&lt;/math&gt;

where the minimum is taken over the closest points ''z'' to ''x'' in ''F''.

:To check this, let

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f_\varepsilon(h)=\min_{z} 2h\cdot(x- z),}&lt;/math&gt;

:where the minimum is taken over ''z'' in ''F'' such that ''d''(''x'',''z'') ≤ ''d''(''x'',''F'') + ε.

:Since ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt; is homogeneous in ''h'' and increases uniformly to ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; on any sphere,

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f_0(h) \ge f_\varepsilon(h) \ge f_0(h) - C(\varepsilon) |h|,}&lt;/math&gt;

:with a constant ''C''(ε) tending to 0 as ε tends to 0.

:This differentiability property follows from this because

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{D(x+h) \le |x+h-z|^2 \le |z-x|^2 +2h\cdot (x-z) + |h|^2 =D(x) +f_0(h) +|h|^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:and similarly if |''h''| ≤ ε

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{D(x+h) \ge D(x) + f_\varepsilon(h) + |h|^2.}&lt;/math&gt;

The differentiability property implies that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\lim{\delta\downarrow 0} {D(c(t+\delta)) - D(c(t))\over \delta} =2\min_z X(c(t))\cdot (c(t)-z),}&lt;/math&gt;

minimized over closest points ''z'' to ''c''(''t''). For any such ''z''

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{2X(c(t))\cdot (c(t)-z)= 2 X(z)\cdot (c(t)-z) - 2(X(z)-X(c(t)))\cdot (c(t)-z).}&lt;/math&gt;

Since −|''y'' − ''c''(''t'')|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has a local maximum on ''F'' at ''y'' = ''z'', ''c''(''t'') −  ''z'' is an exterior normal vector at ''z''. So the first term on the right hand side is non-negative. The Lipschitz condition for ''X'' implies the second term is bounded above by 2''C''⋅''D''(''c''(''t'')). Thus the [[one-sided derivatives|derivative from the right]] of

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{e^{-2Ct}D(c(t))}&lt;/math&gt;

is non-positive, so it is a non-increasing function of ''t''. Thus if ''c''(0) lies in ''F'', ''D''(''c''(0))=0 and hence ''D''(''c''(''t'')) = 0 for ''t'' &gt; 0, i.e. ''c''(''t'') lies in ''F'' for ''t'' &gt; 0.

{{See also|Comparison (mathematics)}}
In [[mathematics]], any two elements ''x'' and ''y'' of a set ''P'' that is [[partial order|partially ordered]] by a binary relation ≤ are '''comparable''' when either ''x'' ≤ ''y'' or ''y'' ≤ ''x''.  If it is not the case that ''x'' and ''y'' are comparable, then they are called '''incomparable'''.

A [[total order|totally ordered]] set is exactly a partially ordered set in which every pair of elements is comparable.

It follows immediately from the definitions of ''comparability'' and ''incomparability'' that both relations are [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], that is ''x'' is comparable to ''y'' if and only if ''y'' is comparable to ''x'', and likewise for incomparability.

==Notation==

Comparability is denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\overset{&lt;}{\underset{&gt;}{=}}&lt;/math&gt;, and incomparability by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\cancel{\overset{&lt;}{\underset{&gt;}{=}}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Combinatorics and Partially Ordered Sets:Dimension Theory|first=William T.|last=Trotter|publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ. Press|year=1992|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, for any pair of elements ''x'' and ''y'' of a partially ordered set, exactly one of
* &lt;math&gt;x \overset{&lt;}{\underset{&gt;}{=}}y&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;x \cancel{\overset{&lt;}{\underset{&gt;}{=}}}y&lt;/math&gt; 
is true.

== Comparability graphs ==
{{main article|Comparability graph}}
The comparability graph of a partially ordered set ''P'' has as vertices the elements of ''P'' and has as edges precisely those pairs {''x'', ''y''} of elements for which &lt;math&gt;x\overset{&lt;}{\underset{&gt;}{=}}y&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A characterization of comparability graphs and of interval graphs|first1=P. C.|last1=Gilmore|first2=A. J.|last2=Hoffman|author2-link=Alan Hoffman (mathematician)|url=http://www.cms.math.ca/cjm/v16/p539|journal=Canadian Journal of Mathematics|volume=16|year=1964|pages=539–548|doi=10.4153/CJM-1964-055-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

When [[Class (set theory)|classifying]] mathematical objects (e.g., [[topological space]]s), two ''criteria'' are said to be comparable when the objects that obey one criterion constitute a subset of the objects that obey the other, which is to say when they are comparable under the partial order ⊂. For example, the [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Hausdorff space|T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] criteria are comparable, while the T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and [[sober space|sobriety]] criteria are not.

In [[probability theory]], particularly [[information theory]], the '''conditional mutual information'''&lt;ref name = Wyner1978&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wyner|first=A. D. |title=A definition of conditional mutual information for arbitrary ensembles|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019995878900268|journal=Information and Control|year=1978|volume=38|issue=1|pages=51–59|doi=10.1016/s0019-9958(78)90026-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Dobrushin1959&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dobrushin|first=R. L. |title=General formulation of Shannon's main theorem in information theory|journal=Ushepi Mat. Nauk.|year=1959|volume=14|pages=3–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; is, in its most basic form, the [[expected value]] of the [[mutual information]] of two random variables given the value of a third.

==Definition==
For discrete random variables &lt;math&gt;X,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;Y,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z,&lt;/math&gt; we define
:&lt;math&gt;I(X;Y|Z) = \operatorname E_Z \big(I(X;Y)|Z\big)
    = \sum_{z\in Z} p_Z(z) \sum_{y\in Y} \sum_{x\in X}
      p_{X,Y|Z}(x,y|z) \log \frac{p_{X,Y|Z}(x,y|z)}{p_{X|Z}(x|z)p_{Y|Z}(y|z)},&lt;/math&gt;
where the marginal, joint, and/or conditional [[probability mass function]]s are denoted by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; with the appropriate subscript. This can be simplified as
:&lt;math&gt;I(X;Y|Z) = \sum_{z\in Z} \sum_{y\in Y} \sum_{x\in X}
      p_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z) \log \frac{p_Z(z)p_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z)}{p_{X,Z}(x,z)p_{Y,Z}(y,z)}.&lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively, we may write in terms of joint and conditional [[Entropy_(information_theory)|entropies]] as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cover |first1=Thomas |author-link1=Thomas M. Cover |last2=Thomas |first2=Joy A. |title=Elements of Information Theory |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]] |date=2006 |isbn=0-471-24195-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I(X;Y|Z) = H(X,Z) + H(Y,Z) - H(X,Y,Z) - H(Z)
                = H(X|Z) - H(X|Y,Z) = H(X|Z)+H(Y|Z)-H(X,Y|Z).&lt;/math&gt;
This can be rewritten to show its relationship to mutual information
:&lt;math&gt;I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;Z)&lt;/math&gt;
usually rearranged as '''the chain rule for mutual information'''
:&lt;math&gt;I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)&lt;/math&gt;
Another equivalent form of the above is&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1863993/decomposition-of-shannon-conditional-mutual-information-as-seen-on-wikipedia-so Decomposition on Math.StackExchange]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I(X;Y|Z) = H(Z|X) + H(X) + H(Z|Y) + H(Y) - H(Z|X,Y) - H(X,Y) - H(Z)
                = I(X;Y) + H(Z|X) + H(Z|Y) - H(Z|X,Y) - H(Z)&lt;/math&gt;

Like mutual information, conditional mutual information can be expressed as a [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]]:

:&lt;math&gt; I(X;Y|Z) = D_{\mathrm{KL}}[ p(X,Y,Z) \| p(X|Z)p(Y|Z)p(Z) ]. &lt;/math&gt;

Or as an expected value of simpler Kullback–Leibler divergences:
:&lt;math&gt; I(X;Y|Z) = \sum_{z \in Z} p( Z=z ) D_{\mathrm{KL}}[ p(X,Y|z) \| p(X|z)p(Y|z) ], &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; I(X;Y|Z) = \sum_{y \in Y} p( Y=y ) D_{\mathrm{KL}}[ p(X,Z|y) \| p(X|Z)p(Z|y) ]. &lt;/math&gt;

==More general definition==
A more general definition of conditional mutual information, applicable to random variables with continuous or other arbitrary distributions, will depend on the concept of '''[[regular conditional probability]]'''.  (See also.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/ConditionalProbabilityMeasure.html Regular Conditional Probability] on [http://planetmath.org/ PlanetMath]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Leao, Jr. et al. ''Regular conditional probability, disintegration of probability and Radon spaces.'' Proyecciones. Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 15–29, May 2004, Universidad Católica del Norte, Antofagasta, Chile [http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/proy/v23n1/art02.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathfrak P)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability space]], and let the random variables ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' each be defined as a Borel-measurable function from &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; to some state space endowed with a topological structure.

Consider the Borel measure (on the σ-algebra generated by the open sets) in the state space of each random variable defined by assigning each Borel set the &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak P&lt;/math&gt;-measure of its preimage in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal F&lt;/math&gt;.  This is called the [[pushforward measure]] &lt;math&gt;X _* \mathfrak P = \mathfrak P\big(X^{-1}(\cdot)\big).&lt;/math&gt;  The '''support of a random variable''' is defined to be the [[Support (measure theory)|topological support]] of this measure, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{supp}\,X = \mathrm{supp}\,X _* \mathfrak P.&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can formally define the [[conditional probability distribution|conditional probability measure]] given the value of one (or, via the [[product topology]], more) of the random variables.  Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a measurable subset of &lt;math&gt;\Omega,&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;M \in \mathcal F,&lt;/math&gt;) and let &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathrm{supp}\,X.&lt;/math&gt;  Then, using the [[disintegration theorem]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak P(M | X=x) = \lim_{U \ni x}
  \frac {\mathfrak P(M \cap \{X \in U\})}
        {\mathfrak P(\{X \in U\})}
  \qquad \textrm{and} \qquad \mathfrak P(M|X) = \int_M d\mathfrak P\big(\omega|X=X(\omega)\big),&lt;/math&gt;
where the limit is taken over the open neighborhoods &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, as they are allowed to become arbitrarily smaller with respect to [[Subset|set inclusion]].

Finally we can define the conditional mutual information via [[Lebesgue integration]]:
:&lt;math&gt;I(X;Y|Z) = \int_\Omega \log
  \frac {d \mathfrak P(\omega|X,Z)\, d\mathfrak P(\omega|Y,Z)}
        {d \mathfrak P(\omega|Z)\, d\mathfrak P(\omega|X,Y,Z)}
  d \mathfrak P(\omega),
  &lt;/math&gt;
where the integrand is the logarithm of a [[Radon–Nikodym derivative]] involving some of the conditional probability measures we have just defined.

==Note on notation==
In an expression such as &lt;math&gt;I(A;B|C),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;B,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; need not necessarily be restricted to representing individual random variables, but could also represent the joint distribution of any collection of random variables defined on the same [[probability space]].  As is common in [[probability theory]], we may use the comma to denote such a joint distribution, e.g. &lt;math&gt;I(A_0,A_1;B_1,B_2,B_3|C_0,C_1).&lt;/math&gt;  Hence the use of the semicolon (or occasionally a colon or even a wedge &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;) to separate the principal arguments of the mutual information symbol.  (No such distinction is necessary in the symbol for [[joint entropy]], since the joint entropy of any number of random variables is the same as the entropy of their joint distribution.)

== Properties ==
It is always true that
:&lt;math&gt;I(X;Y|Z) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;,
for discrete, jointly distributed random variables ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z''.  This result has been used as a basic building block for proving other [[inequalities in information theory]], in particular, those known as Shannon-type inequalities.

Conditioning on a third random variable may either increase or decrease the mutual information: that is, the difference &lt;math&gt;I(X;Y|Z) - I(X;Y)&lt;/math&gt;, called the [[interaction information]], may be positive, negative, or zero. This is the case even when random variables are pairwise independent. Such is the case when: &lt;math display="block"&gt;X \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(0.5), Z \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(0.5), \quad Y=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} X &amp; \text{if }Z=0\\ 1-X &amp; \text{if }Z=1 \end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;in which case ''X,Y,Z'' are pairwise independent and in particular &lt;math&gt;I(X;Y)=0&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;I(X;Y|Z)=1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Multivariate mutual information==
{{main|Multivariate mutual information}}
The conditional mutual information can be used to inductively define a '''multivariate mutual information''' in a set- or [[Information theory and measure theory|measure-theoretic sense]] in the context of '''[[information diagram]]s'''.  In this sense we define the multivariate mutual information as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;I(X_1;\ldots;X_{n+1}) = I(X_1;\ldots;X_n) - I(X_1;\ldots;X_n|X_{n+1}),&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;I(X_1;\ldots;X_n|X_{n+1}) = \operatorname E_{X_{n+1}}\big(I(X_1;\ldots;X_n)|X_{n+1}\big).&lt;/math&gt;
This definition is identical to that of [[interaction information]] except for a change in sign in the case of an odd number of random variables.  A complication is that this multivariate mutual information (as well as the interaction information) can be positive, negative, or zero, which makes this quantity difficult to interpret intuitively.  In fact, for ''n'' random variables, there are &lt;math&gt;2^n-1&lt;/math&gt; degrees of freedom for how they might be correlated in an information-theoretic sense, corresponding to each non-empty subset of these variables.  These degrees of freedom are bounded by various Shannon- and non-Shannon-type [[inequalities in information theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7512">In [[mathematical logic]], '''Craig's interpolation theorem''' is a result about the relationship between different logical [[theory (mathematical logic)|theories]]. Roughly stated, the theorem says that if a [[well formed formula|formula]] φ implies a formula ψ, and the two have at least one atomic variable symbol in common, then there is a third formula ρ, called an interpolant, such that every nonlogical symbol in ρ occurs both in φ and ψ, φ implies ρ, and ρ implies ψ. The theorem was first proved for [[first-order logic]] by [[William Craig (logician)|William Craig]] in 1957. Variants of the theorem hold for other logics, such as [[propositional logic]]. A stronger form of Craig's theorem for first-order logic was proved by [[Roger Lyndon]] in 1959; the overall result is sometimes called the '''Craig&amp;ndash;Lyndon theorem'''.

== Example ==
In [[propositional logic]], let
:&amp;phi; = ~(P &amp;and; Q) &amp;rarr; (~R &amp;and; Q)
:&amp;psi; = (T &amp;rarr; P) &amp;or; (T &amp;rarr; ~R).

Then φ [[tautological implication|tautologically implies]] ψ. This can be verified by writing φ in [[conjunctive normal form]]:
:&amp;phi; &amp;equiv; (P &amp;or; ~R) &amp;and; Q.
Thus, if φ holds, then (P ∨ ~R) holds. In turn, (P ∨ ~R) tautologically implies ψ. Because the two propositional variables occurring in (P ∨ ~R) occur in both φ and ψ, this means that (P ∨ ~R)  is an interpolant for the implication φ → ψ.

== Lyndon's interpolation theorem ==
Suppose that ''S'' and ''T'' are two first-order theories. As notation, let ''S'' ∪ ''T'' denote the smallest theory including both ''S'' and ''T''; the [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]] of ''S'' ∪ ''T'' is the smallest one containing the signatures of ''S'' and ''T''. Also let ''S'' ∩ ''T'' be the intersection of the languages of the two theories; the signature of ''S'' ∩ ''T'' is the intersection of the signatures of the two languages.

Lyndon's theorem says that if ''S'' ∪ ''T'' is unsatisfiable, then there is an interpolating sentence ρ in the language of ''S'' ∩ ''T'' that is true in all models of ''S'' and false in all models of ''T''. Moreover, ρ has the stronger property that every relation symbol that has a [[positive occurrence]] in ρ has a positive occurrence in some formula of ''S'' and a negative occurrence in some formula of ''T'', and every relation symbol with a negative occurrence in ρ has a negative occurrence in some formula of ''S'' and a positive occurrence in some formula of ''T''.

==Proof of Craig's interpolation theorem==
We present here a [[constructive proof]] of the Craig interpolation theorem for [[propositional logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison pgs. 426–427&lt;/ref&gt;  Formally, the theorem states:

''If ⊨φ → ψ then there is a ρ (the ''interpolant'') such that ⊨φ → ρ and ⊨ρ → ψ, where atoms(ρ) ⊆ atoms(φ) ∩ atoms(ψ). Here atoms(φ) is the set of [[propositional variable]]s occurring in φ, and ⊨ is the [[Entailment|semantic entailment relation]] for propositional logic.''

'''Proof.'''
Assume ⊨φ → ψ. The proof proceeds by induction on the number of propositional variables occurring in φ that do not occur in ψ, denoted |''atoms''(φ) − ''atoms''(ψ)|.

Base case |''atoms''(φ) − ''atoms''(ψ)| = 0:  In this case, φ is suitable.  This is because since |''atoms''(φ) − ''atoms''(ψ)| = 0, we know that ''atoms''(φ) ⊆ ''atoms''(φ) ∩ ''atoms''(ψ).  Moreover we have that ⊨φ → φ and ⊨φ → ψ.  This suffices to show that φ is a suitable interpolant in this case.

Let’s assume for the inductive step that the result has been shown for all χ where |''atoms''(χ) − ''atoms''(ψ)| = n.  Now assume that |''atoms''(φ) − ''atoms''(ψ)| = n+1.  Pick a ''p'' ∈ ''atoms''(φ) but ''p'' ∉ ''atoms''(ψ).  Now define:

φ' := φ[⊤/''p''] ∨ φ[⊥/''p'']

Here φ[⊤/''p''] is the same as φ with every occurrence of ''p'' replaced by ⊤ and φ[⊥/''p''] similarly replaces ''p'' with ⊥.  We may observe three things from this definition:

{{NumBlk|:|⊨φ' → ψ|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|{{abs|''atoms''(φ') − ''atoms''(ψ)}} {{=}} n|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|⊨φ → φ'|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

From {{EqNote|1}}, {{EqNote|2}} and the inductive step we have that there is an interpolant ρ such that:

{{NumBlk|:|⊨φ' → ρ|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|⊨ρ → ψ|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

But from {{EqNote|3}} and {{EqNote|4}} we know that

{{NumBlk|:|⊨φ → ρ|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

Hence, ρ is a suitable interpolant for φ and ψ.

'''QED'''

Since the above proof is [[Intuitionistic logic|constructive]], one may extract an [[algorithm]] for computing interpolants.  Using this algorithm, if ''n'' = |''atoms''(φ') − ''atoms''(ψ)|, then the interpolant ρ has ''O''(''EXP''(''n'')) more [[logical connective]]s than φ (see [[Big O Notation]] for details regarding this assertion).  Similar constructive proofs may be provided for the basic [[modal logic]] K, [[intuitionistic logic]] and [[mu calculus|μ-calculus]], with similar complexity measures.

Craig interpolation can be proved by other methods as well.  However, these proofs are generally [[non-constructive]]:
* [[model theory|model-theoretically]], via [[Robinson's joint consistency theorem]]: in presence of [[Compactness theorem|compactness]], negation and conjunction, Robinson's joint consistency theorem and Craig interpolation are equivalent.
* [[proof theory|proof-theoretically]], via a [[Sequent calculus]]. If [[cut elimination]] is possible and as a result the [[subformula property]] holds, then Craig interpolation is provable via induction over the derivations.
* [[Abstract algebraic logic|algebraically]], using [[Amalgamation (model theory)|amalgamation]] theorems for the [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of algebras representing the logic.
* via translation to other logics enjoying Craig interpolation.

==Applications==
Craig interpolation has many applications, among them [[consistency proof]]s, [[model checking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vizel | first1 = Y. | last2 = Weissenbacher | first2 = G. | last3 = Malik | first3 = S. | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 103 | issue = 11 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2015.2455034|title=Boolean Satisfiability Solvers and Their Applications in Model Checking}}&lt;/ref&gt; proofs in [[Modularity (programming)|modular]] [[Specification language|specifications]], modular [[Ontology (computer science)|ontologies]].

'''Cryptovirology''' is a field that studies how to use [[cryptography]] to design powerful [[malware|malicious software]]. The field was born with the observation that [[public-key cryptography]] can be used to break the symmetry between what an [[antivirus]] analyst sees regarding malware and what the attacker sees. The antivirus analyst sees a public key contained in the malware whereas the attacker sees the public key contained in the malware as well as the corresponding private key (outside the malware) since the attacker created the key pair for the attack. The public key allows the malware to perform [[trapdoor function|trapdoor one-way]] operations on the victim's computer that only the attacker can undo.

The first cryptovirology attack, invented by Adam L. Young and [[Moti Yung]], is called "cryptoviral extortion" and it was presented at the 1996 IEEE Security &amp; [[Privacy]] conference.&lt;ref name="Young and Yung 96"&gt;{{cite conference|author=A. Young, M. Yung|title=Cryptovirology: Extortion-Based Security Threats and Countermeasures|booktitle=IEEE Symposium on Security &amp; Privacy, May 6–8, 1996|pages=129&amp;ndash;141}} [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=502676 IEEEExplore: Cryptovirology: extortion-based security threats and countermeasures]&lt;/ref&gt; In this attack a cryptovirus, cryptoworm, or cryptotrojan contains the public key of the attacker and [[Hybrid cryptosystem|hybrid encrypts]] the victim's files. The malware prompts the user to send the asymmetric ciphertext to the attacker who will decipher it and return the symmetric decryption key it contains for a fee. The victim needs the symmetric key to decrypt the encrypted files if there is no way to recover the original files (e.g., from backups). The 1996 IEEE paper predicted that cryptoviral extortion attackers would one day demand e-money, long before bitcoin even existed. Many years later the media relabeled cryptoviral extortion as [[ransomware]]. In 2016 cryptovirology attacks on healthcare providers reached epidemic levels prompting the U.S. [[United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] to issue a Fact Sheet on Ransomware and
[[HIPAA]].&lt;ref name="hhsfactsheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=FACT SHEET: Ransomware and HIPAA|
url=https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/RansomwareFactSheet.pdf|publisher=[[United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services|HHS]]|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fact sheet states that when electronic protected health information is encrypted by ransomware a breach has occurred and the attack therefore constitutes a ''disclosure'' that is not permitted under HIPAA, the rationale being that an adversary has taken control of the information. Sensitive data might never leave the victim organization, but the break-in may have allowed data to be sent out undetected. California enacted a law that defines the introduction of ransomware into a computer system with the intent of extortion as being against the law.&lt;ref&gt;SB-1137 that amends Section 523 of the Penal Code.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field also encompasses covert malware attacks in which the attacker ''securely'' steals private information such as symmetric keys, private keys, [[Pseudorandom number generator|PRNG]] state, and the victim's data. Examples of such covert attacks are asymmetric [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]s. An '''asymmetric backdoor''' is a backdoor (e.g., in a cryptosystem) that can be used only by the attacker, even after it is found. This contrasts with the traditional backdoor that is symmetric, i.e., anyone that finds it can use it. [[Kleptography]], a subfield of cryptovirology, is the study of asymmetric back doors in key generation algorithms, digital signature algorithms, key exchanges, pseudorandom number generators, encryption algorithms, and other cryptographic algorithms. The NIST [[Dual EC DRBG]] random bit generator has an asymmetric backdoor in it. The EC-DRBG algorithm utilizes the discrete-log kleptogram from Kleptography which by definition makes the EC-DRBG a cryptotrojan. Like ransomware, the EC-DRBG cryptotrojan contains and uses the attacker's public key to attack the host system. The cryptographer Ari Juels indicated that
NSA effectively orchestrated a kleptographic attack on users of the Dual EC DRBG pseudorandom number generation algorithm and that, although security professionals and developers have been testing and implementing kleptographic attacks since 1996, "you would be hard-pressed to find one in actual use until now".&lt;ref name="sci_amer_klepto"&gt;{{cite news|

Covert information leakage attacks carried out by cryptoviruses, cryptotrojans, and cryptoworms that, by definition, contain and use the public key of the attacker is a major theme in cryptovirology. In "deniable password snatching", a cryptovirus installs a cryptotrojan that asymmetrically encrypts host data and covertly broadcasts it. This makes it available to everyone, noticeable by no one (except the attacker), and only decipherable by the attacker. An attacker caught installing the cryptotrojan claims to be a virus victim. An attacker observed receiving the covert asymmetric broadcast is one of thousands if not millions of receivers and exhibits no identifying information whatsoever. The cryptovirology attack achieves "end-to-end deniability". It is a covert asymmetric broadcast of the victim's data. Cryptovirology also encompasses the use of [[private information retrieval]] to allow cryptoviruses to search for and steal host data without revealing the data searched for even when the cryptotrojan is under constant surveillance.&lt;ref name="Young and yung book"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Young, M. Yung|title=Malicious Cryptography: Exposing Cryptovirology|publisher=Wiley|year=2004|isbn=0-7645-4975-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By definition such a cryptovirus carries within its own coding sequence the query of the attacker and the necessary PIR logic to apply the query to host systems.

There has been a long-standing misconception that cryptovirology is mostly about extortion attacks (overt attacks). In fact, the vast majority of cryptovirology attacks are covert in nature. This misconception began to fade in 2013 after whistleblowing revealed that the [[Dual EC DRBG]] is a cryptovirology attack that covertly leaks the internal state of the pseudorandom number generator

==General information==
Cryptovirology was born in academia.&lt;ref name="Young and Yung 96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Young and yung book"/&gt; 
It is an investigation into how modern cryptographic paradigms and tools can be used to strengthen, improve, and develop new malicious software (malware) attacks.&lt;ref name="Cryptovirology FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cryptovirology.com/cryptovfiles/cryptovirologyfaqver1.html|title= Cryptovirology FAQ |last1= Young |first1= Adam |last2= Yung |first2= Moti |date= 2006 |access-date= July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cryptovirology extends beyond finding protocol failures and design vulnerabilities. It is a forward-engineering discipline that can be used for attacking rather than defending.

A "questionable encryption scheme", is an attack tool in cryptovirology. Informally speaking, a questionable encryption scheme is a [[public key cryptosystem]] (3-tuple of algorithms) with two supplementary algorithms, forming a 5-tuple of algorithms. It includes a deliberately bogus yet carefully designed key pair generation algorithm that produces a "fake" public key. The corresponding private key (witness of non-encryption) cannot be used to decipher data "encrypted" using the fake public key. By supplying the key pair to an efficient verification predicate (the 5th algorithm in the 5-tuple) it is proven whether the public key is real or fake. When the public key is fake, it follows that no one can decipher data "enciphered" using the fake public key. A questionable encryption scheme has the property that real public keys are computationally indistinguishable from fake public keys when the private key is not available. The private key forms a [[polynomial|poly-sized]] witness of decipherability or indecipherability, whichever may be the case.

An application of a questionable encryption scheme is a [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan]] that gathers [[plaintext]] from the host, "encrypts" it using the trojan's own public key (which may be real or fake), and then exfiltrates the resulting "ciphertext". In this attack it is thoroughly intractable to prove that data theft has occurred. This holds even when all core dumps of the trojan and all the information that it broadcasts is entered into evidence. An analyst that jumps to the conclusion that the trojan "encrypts" data risks being proven wrong by the malware author (e.g., anonymously).

When the public key is fake, the attacker gets no plaintext from the trojan. So what's the use? A [[spoofing attack]] is possible in which some trojans are released that use real public keys and steal data and some trojans are released that use fake public keys and do not steal data. Many months after the trojans are discovered and analyzed, the attacker anonymously posts the witnesses of non-encryption for the fake public keys. This proves that those trojans never in fact exfiltrated data. This casts doubt on the true nature of future strains of malware that contain such "public keys", since the keys could be real or fake. This attack implies a fundamental limitation on proving data theft.

There are many other attacks in the field of cryptovirology that are not mentioned here.

==Examples of viruses with cryptography and ransom capabilities==
While viruses in the wild have used cryptography in the past, the only purpose of such usage of cryptography was to avoid detection by [[antivirus software]]. For example, the tremor virus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/tremor.shtml F-Secure virus descriptions: Tremor]&lt;/ref&gt; used polymorphism as a defensive technique in an attempt to avoid detection by anti-virus software. Though cryptography does assist in such cases to enhance the longevity of a virus, the capabilities of cryptography are not used in the payload. The One-half virus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2000-121513-2517-99&amp;tabid=1 Symantec security response: One_Half]&lt;/ref&gt; was amongst the first viruses known to have encrypted affected files. However, the One_half virus was not [[Ransomware (malware)|ransomware]], that is it did not demand any ransom for decrypting the files that it has encrypted. It also did not use public key cryptography.
An example of a virus that informs the owner of the infected machine to pay a ransom is the virus nicknamed Tro_Ransom.A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sophos.com/security/analyses/viruses-and-spyware/trojransoma.html Sophos security analyses: Troj_Ransom.A]&lt;/ref&gt; This virus asks the owner of the infected machine to send $10.99 to a given account through [[Western Union]].&lt;br&gt;
[[gpcode|Virus.Win32.Gpcode.ag]] is a classic cryptovirus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viruslist.com/en/viruses/encyclopedia?virusid=123921 Viruslist: Virus.Win32.Gpcode.ag ]&lt;/ref&gt; This virus partially uses a version of 660-bit [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] and encrypts files with many different extensions. It instructs the owner of the machine to email a given mail ID if the owner desires the decryptor. If contacted by email, the user will be asked to pay a certain amount as ransom in return for the decryptor.

==Creation of cryptoviruses==
To successfully write a cryptovirus, a thorough knowledge of the various [[cryptographic primitive]]s such as [[random number generator]]s, proper recommended cipher text chaining modes etc. are necessary. Wrong choices can lead to poor cryptographic strength. So, usage of preexisting routines would be ideal. [[Microsoft]]'s [[Cryptographic API]] (CAPI), is a possible tool for the same. It has been demonstrated that using just 8 different calls to this API, a cryptovirus can satisfy all its encryption needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=A. Young|title=Cryptoviral Extortion Using Microsoft's Crypto API|booktitle=International Journal of Information Security, Volume 5, Issue 2, April 2006| pages=67–76}} [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t8m2v4w360025461 SpringerLink: Cryptoviral extortion using Microsoft's Crypto API]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of cryptography-enabled malware==
Apart from cryptoviral extortion, there are other potential uses&lt;ref name="Young and yung book"/&gt; of cryptoviruses. They are used in deniable password snatching, used with cryptocounters,
used with [[private information retrieval]] and used in secure communication between different instances of a distributed cryptovirus.

In [[statistical physics]], '''directed percolation''' ('''DP''') refers to a class of models that mimic filtering of fluids through porous materials along a given direction. Varying the microscopic connectivity of the pores, these models display a [[phase transition]] from a macroscopically permeable (percolating) to an impermeable (non-percolating) state. Directed percolation is also used as a simple model for epidemic spreading with a transition between survival and extinction of the disease depending on the infection rate.

More generally, the term directed percolation stands for a [[universality class]] of continuous phase transitions which are characterized by the same type of collective behavior on large scales. Directed percolation is probably the simplest universality class of transitions out of [[thermal equilibrium]].

== Lattice models ==
[[File:Bond Directed Percolation.svg|thumb|Realization of permeable (solid line) or closed bonds (no line) on a tilted square lattice. The cluster of sites connected by a directed path (following the arrows) to the source (circled point) is indicated in red.]]
One of the simplest realizations of DP is '''bond directed percolation'''. This model is a directed variant of [[percolation|ordinary (isotropic) percolation]] and can be introduced as follows. The figure shows a tilted square lattice with bonds connecting neighboring sites. The bonds are permeable (open) with probability &lt;math&gt;p\,&lt;/math&gt; and impermeable (closed) otherwise. The sites and bonds may be interpreted as holes and randomly distributed channels of a porous medium.

The difference between ordinary and directed percolation is illustrated to the right. In '''[[percolation|isotropic percolation]]''' a spreading agent (e.g. water) introduced at a particular site percolates along open bonds, generating a cluster of wet sites. Contrarily, in directed percolation the spreading agent can pass open bonds only along a preferred direction in space, as indicated by the arrow. The resulting red cluster is directed in space.

== As a dynamical process ==
Interpreting the preferred direction as a temporal degree of freedom, directed percolation can be regarded as a [[stochastic process]] that evolves in time. In the case of bond DP the time parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is discrete and all sites are updated in parallel. Activating a certain site (called initial seed) at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; the resulting cluster can be constructed row by row. The corresponding number of active sites &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt; varies as time evolves.

== Universal scaling behavior ==
The DP [[universality class]] is characterized by a certain set of [[critical exponents]]. These exponents depend on the spatial dimension &lt;math&gt;d\,&lt;/math&gt;. Above the so-called upper critical dimension &lt;math&gt;d\geq d_c=4\,&lt;/math&gt; they are given by their mean-field values while in 
&lt;math&gt;d&lt;4\,&lt;/math&gt; dimensions they have been estimated numerically. Current estimates are summarized in the following table:

|}

==Other examples==
In two dimensions, the percolation of water through a thin tissue (such as [[toilet paper]]) has the same mathematical underpinnings as the flow of [[electricity]] through two-dimensional random networks of [[resistor]]s. In chemistry, [[chromatography]] can be understood with similar models.

The propagation of a tear or rip in a sheet of paper, in a sheet of metal, or even the formation of a crack in [[ceramic]] bears broad mathematical resemblance to the flow of electricity through a random network of [[electrical fuse]]s. Above a certain critical point, the electrical flow will cause a fuse to pop, possibly leading to a cascade of failures, resembling the propagation of a crack or tear. The study of percolation helps indicate how the flow of electricity will redistribute itself in the fuse network, thus modeling which fuses are most likely to pop next, and how fast they will pop, and what direction the crack may curve in.

Examples can be found not only in physical phenomena, but also in biology, neuroscience, ecology (e.g. [[evolution]]), and economics (e.g. [[diffusion of innovation]]).

Percolation can be considered to be a branch of the study of [[dynamical system]]s or [[statistical mechanics]]. In particular, percolation networks exhibit a phase change around a [[critical threshold]].

== Experimental realizations ==
In spite of vast success in the theoretical and numerical studies of DP, obtaining convincing experimental evidence has proved challenging. However, in 2007, critical behavior of DP was finally found in the electrohydrodynamic convection of liquid crystal, where a complete set of static and dynamic critical exponents and universal scaling functions of DP were measured in the transition to spatiotemporal intermittency between two turbulent states.&lt;ref&gt;K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6125">'''Dissipation''' is the result of an [[irreversible process]] that takes place in homogeneous [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] systems. A dissipative process is a process in which energy (internal, bulk flow kinetic, or system potential) is transformed from some initial form to some final form; the capacity of the final form to do mechanical work is less than that of the initial form. For example, [[Heat Transfer|heat transfer]] is dissipative because it is a transfer of internal energy from a hotter body to a colder one. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], the [[entropy]] varies with temperature (reduces the capacity of the combination of the two bodies to do mechanical work), but never decreases in an isolated system.

These processes produce entropy (see [[entropy production]]) at a certain rate. The entropy production rate times ambient temperature gives the dissipated power. Important examples of irreversible processes are: heat flow through a thermal resistance, fluid flow through a flow resistance, diffusion (mixing), chemical reactions, and electrical current flow through an electrical resistance (Joule heating).

== Definition ==
Thermodynamic dissipative processes are essentially irreversible. They [[entropy production|produce entropy]] at a finite rate. In a process in which the temperature is locally continuously defined, the local density of rate of entropy production times local temperature gives the local density of dissipated power.[Definition needed!]

A particular occasion of occurrence of a dissipative process cannot be described by a single individual [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formalism. A dissipative process requires a collection of admissible individual Hamiltonian descriptions, exactly which one describes the actual particular occurrence of the process of interest being unknown. This includes friction, and all similar forces that result in decoherency of energy&amp;mdash;that is, conversion of [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] or directed energy flow into an indirected or more [[isotropic]] distribution of energy.

=== Energy ===
"The conversion of mechanical energy into heat is called energy dissipation." – ''François Roddier''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editions-parole.net/?product=thermodynamique-de-levolution-un-essai-de-thermo-bio-sociologie Roddier F., ''Thermodynamique de l'évolution (The Thermodynamics of Evolution)'', parole éditions, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also applied to the loss of energy due to generation of unwanted heat in electric and electronic circuits.

=== Computational physics ===
In [[computational physics]], numerical dissipation (also known as "numerical diffusion") refers to certain side-effects that may occur as a result of a numerical solution to a differential equation. When the pure [[advection]] equation, which is free of dissipation, is solved by a numerical approximation method, the energy of the initial wave may be reduced in a way analogous to a diffusional process. Such a method is said to contain 'dissipation'. In some cases, "artificial dissipation" is intentionally added to improve the [[numerical stability]] characteristics of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J.W. Numerical Partial Differential Equation: Finite Difference Methods. Springer-Verlag. New York. (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
A formal, mathematical definition of dissipation, as commonly used in the mathematical study of [[measure-preserving dynamical system]]s, is given in the article ''[[wandering set]]''.

== Examples ==

=== In hydraulic engineering ===
Dissipation is the process of converting mechanical energy of downward-flowing water into thermal and acoustical energy. Various devices are designed in stream beds to reduce the kinetic energy of flowing waters to reduce their [[erosion|erosive potential]] on banks and [[stream bed|river bottoms]]. Very often, these devices look like small [[waterfall]]s or [[waterfall#Types|cascades]], where water flows vertically or over [[riprap]] to lose some of its [[kinetic energy]].

=== Irreversible processes ===
Important examples of irreversible processes are: 
# Heat flow through a thermal resistance
# Fluid flow through a flow resistance
# Diffusion (mixing)
# Chemical reactions&lt;ref&gt;Glansdorff, P., [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine, I.]] (1971). ''Thermodynamic Theory of Structure, Stability, and Fluctuations'', Wiley-Interscience, London, 1971, {{ISBN|0-471-30280-5}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eu, B.C. (1998). ''Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics: Ensemble Method'', Kluwer Academic Publications, Dordrecht, {{ISBN|0-7923-4980-6}}, p. 49,&lt;/ref&gt;
# Electrical current flow through an electrical resistance ([[Joule heating]]).

=== Waves or oscillations ===
[[Wave]]s or [[oscillation]]s, lose [[energy]] over [[time]], typically from [[friction]] or [[turbulence]]. In many cases, the "lost" energy raises the [[temperature]] of the system. For example, a [[wave]] that loses [[amplitude]] is said to dissipate. The precise nature of the effects depends on the nature of the wave: an [[atmospheric wave]], for instance, may dissipate close to the surface due to [[friction]] with the land mass, and at higher levels due to [[radiative cooling]].

== History ==
{{See also |Timeline of thermodynamics}}
The concept of dissipation was introduced in the field of thermodynamics by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin) in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;W. Thomson ''On the universal tendency in nature to the dissipation of mechanical energy'' Philosophical Magazine, Ser. 4, p.&amp;nbsp;304 (1852).&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Kelvin deduced that a subset of the above-mentioned irreversible dissapative processes will occur unless a process is governed by a "perfect thermodynamic engine". The processes that Lord Kelvin identified were friction, diffusion, conduction of heat and the absorption of light.

'''Enriqueta González Baz y de la Vega''' (September 22, 1915 – December 22, 2002) was a Mexican mathematician, a founder of the Mexican Mathematical Society, and the first woman to earn a degree in mathematics in Mexico.{{r|gdl|mim}}

After finishing secondary school, her father sent her two a two-year program in domestic studies, where one of the teachers, Elena Picazo de Murray, recognized her talent. She studied in a night school at the [[San Ildefonso College]], earned a teaching credential at the Escuela Nacional de Maestros, and completed a bachelor's degree in mathematical and physical sciences at the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]] of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. She wrote a thesis on [[special functions]], and did additional postgraduate study at [[Bryn Mawr College]].{{r|mim}}

She became a mathematics professor in the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria, as well as holding several other associated positions. Among her mathematical works, she translated [[Solomon Lefschetz]]'s 1930 textbook ''Topology''.{{r|mim}}

'''Ernst Witt''' (26 June 1911 – 3 July 1991) was a German [[mathematician]], one of the leading [[Abstract algebra|algebraists]] of his time.

==Biography==
Witt was born on the island of [[Als (island)|Alsen]], then a part of the [[German Empire]]. Shortly after his birth, his parents moved the family to [[China]], and he did not return to Europe until he was nine.

After his schooling, Witt went to the [[University of Freiburg]] and the [[University of Göttingen]]. He joined the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] and was an active party member.&lt;ref&gt;According to Schappacher (letter in Mathematical Intelligencer 1996) it was most certainly him and not [[Oswald Teichmüller]], who attended [[Emmy Noether]]'s private seminar held in her house while wearing his [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]-uniform.&lt;/ref&gt; Witt completed his [[Ph.D.]] at the University of Göttingen in 1934 with [[Emmy Noether]] and later became a lecturer. He was then a member of a team led by [[Helmut Hasse]]. During [[World War II]] he joined a group of five mathematicians, recruited by [[Wilhelm Fenner]], and which included [[Georg Aumann]], [[Alexander Aigner]], [[Oswald Teichmüller]], [[Johann Friedrich Schultze (mathematician)|Johann Friedrich Schultze]] and their leader professor [[Wolfgang Franz (mathematician)|Wolfgang Franz]], to form the backbone of the new mathematical research department in the late 1930s, which would eventually be called: Section IVc of [[Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht]] (abbr. OKW/Chi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7sNVKDp-yiJNjE4YTIyOTctNGFlZi00NTliLWEwZWUtOGYxYzEyMjk1NGE1/view|title=Army Security Agency: DF-187 The Career of Wilhelm Fenner with Special Regard to his activity in the field of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis (PDF) |page = 7|date=1 December 1949 |website=Google Drive |access-date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TICOM reports DF-187 A-G and DF-176, ‘European Axis Signal Intelligence in World War II’ vol 2&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1937 until 1979, he taught at the [[University of Hamburg]]. He died in Hamburg in 1991, shortly after his 80th birthday.

==Work==
Witt's work has been highly influential. His invention of the [[Witt vector]]s clarifies and generalizes the structure of the [[p-adic number]]s. It has become fundamental to [[p-adic Hodge theory]].

Witt was the founder of the theory of [[quadratic forms]] over an arbitrary [[Field (mathematics)|field]]. He proved several of the key results, including the [[Witt's theorem|Witt cancellation theorem]]. He defined the [[Witt group#Ring structure|Witt ring]] of all quadratic forms over a field, now a central object in the theory.

The [[Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem]] is basic to the study of [[Lie algebra]]s. In [[algebraic geometry]], the [[Hasse–Witt matrix]] of an [[algebraic curve]] over a [[finite field]] determines the cyclic [[étale morphism|étale]] coverings of degree ''p'' of a curve in characteristic ''p''.

In the 1970s, Witt claimed that in 1940 he had discovered what would eventually be named the "[[Leech lattice]]" many years before [[John Leech (mathematician)|John Leech]] discovered it in 1965, but Witt did not publish his discovery and the details of exactly what he did are unclear; see his collected works {{harv|Witt|1998|pp=328–329}}.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Fatou–Lebesgue theorem''' establishes a chain of [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] relating the [[integral]]s (in the sense of [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue]]) of the [[limit superior and limit inferior|limit inferior]] and the [[limit superior and limit inferior|limit superior]] of a [[sequence]] of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s to the limit inferior and the limit superior of integrals of these functions.  The theorem is named after [[Pierre Fatou]] and [[Henri Léon Lebesgue]].

If the sequence of functions converges [[pointwise convergence|pointwise]], the inequalities turn into [[equality (mathematics)|equalities]] and the theorem reduces to Lebesgue's [[dominated convergence theorem]].

==Statement of the theorem==
Let ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... denote a sequence of [[real number|real]]-valued [[measurable function|measurable]] functions defined on a [[measure space]] (''S'',''Σ'',''μ''). If there exists a Lebesgue-integrable function ''g'' on ''S'' which dominates the sequence in absolute value, meaning that |''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''g'' for all [[natural number]]s ''n'', then all ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as well as the limit inferior and the limit superior of the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are integrable and
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_S \liminf_{n\to\infty} f_n\,d\mu
\le \liminf_{n\to\infty} \int_S f_n\,d\mu
\le \limsup_{n\to\infty} \int_S f_n\,d\mu
\le \int_S \limsup_{n\to\infty} f_n\,d\mu\,.
&lt;/math&gt;
Here the limit inferior and the limit superior of the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are taken pointwise. The integral of the absolute value of these limiting functions is bounded above by the integral of ''g''.

Since the middle inequality (for sequences of real numbers) is always true, the directions of the other inequalities are easy to remember.

==Proof==
All ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as well as the limit inferior and the limit superior of the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are measurable and dominated in absolute value by ''g'', hence integrable.

The first inequality follows by applying [[Fatou's lemma]] to the non-negative functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''g'' and using the [[Lebesgue_integral#Basic_theorems_of_the_Lebesgue_integral|linearity of the Lebesgue integral]]. The last inequality is the [[Fatou's_lemma#Reverse_Fatou_lemma|reverse Fatou lemma]].

Since ''g'' also dominates the limit superior of the |''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|,

:&lt;math&gt;0\le\biggl|\int_S \liminf_{n\to\infty} f_n\,d\mu\biggr|
\le\int_S \Bigl|\liminf_{n\to\infty} f_n\Bigr|\,d\mu
\le\int_S \limsup_{n\to\infty} |f_n|\,d\mu
\le\int_S g\,d\mu&lt;/math&gt;

by the [[Lebesgue_integral#Basic_theorems_of_the_Lebesgue_integral|monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral]]. The same estimates hold for the limit superior of the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''First-order logic'''—also known as '''first-order predicate calculus''' and '''predicate logic'''—is a collection of [[formal system]]s used in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], and [[computer science]]. First-order logic uses [[Quantification (logic)|quantified variables]] over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as ''Socrates is a man'' one can have expressions in the form "there exists X such that X is [[Socrates]] and X is a man" and ''there exists'' is a quantifier while ''X'' is a variable.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Dr. J. P. E., [http://people.sju.edu/~jhodgson/ugai/1order.html "First Order Logic"], [[Saint Joseph's University]], [[Philadelphia]], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguishes it from [[propositional logic]], which does not use quantifiers or relations.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Edward Hughes|Hughes, G. E.]], &amp; [[Max Cresswell|Cresswell, M. J.]], ''A New Introduction to Modal Logic'' ([[London]]: [[Routledge]], 1996), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=_CB5wiBeaA4C&amp;pg=PA161#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.161].&lt;/ref&gt;

A theory about a topic is usually a first-order logic together with a specified [[domain of discourse]] over which the quantified variables range, finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many predicates defined on that domain, and a set of axioms believed to hold for those things. Sometimes "theory" is understood in a more formal sense, which is just a set of sentences in first-order logic.

The adjective "first-order" distinguishes first-order logic from [[higher-order logic]] in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which one or both of predicate quantifiers or function quantifiers are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mendelson|first=Elliott|title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic|year=1964|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets. In interpreted higher-order theories, predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets.

There are many [[deductive system]]s for first-order logic which are both [[Soundness#Logical systems|sound]] (all provable statements are true in all models) and [[Completeness (logic)|complete]] (all statements which are true in all models are provable). Although the [[logical consequence]] relation is only [[semidecidability|semidecidable]], much progress has been made in [[automated theorem proving]] in first-order logic. First-order logic also satisfies several [[metalogic]]al theorems that make it amenable to analysis in [[proof theory]], such as the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] and the [[compactness theorem]].

First-order logic is the standard for the formalization of mathematics into [[Axiomatic system|axioms]] and is studied in the [[foundations of mathematics]].
[[Peano arithmetic]] and [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] are axiomatizations of [[number theory]] and [[set theory]], respectively, into first-order logic.
No first-order theory, however, has the strength to uniquely describe  a structure with an infinite domain, such as the [[natural number]]s or the [[real line]]. Axiom systems that do fully describe these two structures (that is, [[categorical theory|categorical]] axiom systems) can be obtained in stronger logics such as [[second-order logic]].

The foundations of first-order logic were developed independently by [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric M. Hammer: Semantics for Existential Graphs, ''Journal of Philosophical Logic'', Volume 27, Issue 5 (October 1998), page 489: "Development of first-order logic independently of Frege, anticipating prenex and Skolem normal forms"&lt;/ref&gt; For a history of first-order logic and how it came to dominate formal logic, see José Ferreirós (2001).

==Introduction==
While [[propositional logic]] deals with simple declarative propositions, first-order logic additionally covers [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]]s and [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]].

A predicate takes an entity or entities in the [[domain of discourse]] as input while outputs are either True or False. Consider the two sentences "Socrates is a philosopher" and "Plato is a philosopher". In [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]], these sentences are viewed as being unrelated and might be denoted, for example, by variables such as ''p'' and ''q''. The predicate "is a philosopher" occurs in both sentences, which have a common structure of "''a'' is a philosopher". The variable ''a'' is instantiated as "Socrates" in the first sentence and is instantiated as "Plato" in the second sentence. While first-order logic allows for the use of predicates, such as "is a philosopher" in this example, propositional logic does not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Goertzel|Goertzel, B.]], Geisweiller, N., Coelho, L., Janičić, P., &amp; Pennachin, C., ''Real-World Reasoning: Toward Scalable, Uncertain Spatiotemporal, Contextual and Causal Inference'' ([[Amsterdam]] &amp; [[Paris]]: [[Springer Science+Business Media|Atlantis Press]], 2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=g7UAIhnmJpsC&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 29].&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships between predicates can be stated using [[logical connective]]s. Consider, for example, the first-order formula "if ''a'' is a philosopher, then ''a'' is a scholar". This formula is a [[material conditional|conditional]] statement with "''a'' is a philosopher" as its hypothesis and "''a'' is a scholar" as its conclusion. The truth of this formula depends on which object is denoted by ''a'', and on the interpretations of the predicates "is a philosopher" and "is a scholar".

Quantifiers can be applied to variables in a formula. The variable ''a'' in the previous formula can be universally quantified, for instance, with the first-order sentence "For every ''a'', if ''a'' is a philosopher, then ''a'' is a scholar". The [[universal quantifier]] "for every" in this sentence expresses the idea that the claim "if ''a'' is a philosopher, then ''a'' is a scholar" holds for ''all'' choices of ''a''.

The ''[[negation]]'' of the sentence "For every ''a'', if ''a'' is a philosopher, then ''a'' is a scholar" is logically equivalent to the sentence "There exists ''a'' such that ''a'' is a philosopher and ''a'' is not a scholar". The [[existential quantifier]] "there exists" expresses the idea that the claim "''a'' is a philosopher and ''a'' is not a scholar" holds for ''some'' choice of ''a''.

The predicates "is a philosopher" and "is a scholar" each take a single variable. In general, predicates can take several variables. In the first-order sentence "Socrates is the teacher of Plato", the predicate "is the teacher of" takes two variables.

An interpretation (or model) of a first-order formula specifies what each predicate means and the entities that can instantiate the variables. These entities form the [[domain of discourse]] or universe, which is usually required to be a nonempty set. For example, in an interpretation with the domain of discourse consisting of all human beings and the predicate "is a philosopher" understood as "was the author of the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''", the sentence "There exists ''a'' such that ''a'' is a philosopher" is seen as being true, as witnessed by Plato.

==Syntax==
There are two key parts of first-order logic. The [[syntax]] determines which collections of symbols are legal expressions in first-order logic, while the [[semantics]] determine the meanings behind these expressions.

===Alphabet===
Unlike natural languages, such as English, the language of first-order logic is completely formal, so that it can be mechanically determined whether a given expression is legal.  There are two key types of legal expressions: '''terms''', which intuitively represent objects, and '''formulas''', which intuitively express predicates that can be true or false. The terms and formulas of first-order logic are strings of '''symbols''', where all the symbols together form the '''alphabet''' of the language. As with all [[formal language]]s, the nature of the symbols themselves is outside the scope of formal logic; they are often regarded simply as letters and punctuation symbols.

It is common to divide the symbols of the alphabet into '''logical symbols''', which always have the same meaning, and '''non-logical symbols''', whose meaning varies by interpretation. For example, the logical symbol &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; always represents "and"; it is never interpreted as "or". On the other hand, a non-logical predicate symbol such as Phil(''x'') could be interpreted to mean "''x'' is a philosopher", "''x'' is a man named Philip", or any other unary predicate, depending on the interpretation at hand.

====Logical symbols====
There are several logical symbols in the alphabet, which vary by author but usually include:
* The quantifier symbols [[Universal quantification|∀]] and [[Existential quantification|∃]]
* The [[logical connective]]s: ∧ for [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], ∨ for [[disjunction]],  → for [[material conditional|implication]], ↔ for [[logical biconditional|biconditional]], ¬ for negation.  Occasionally other logical connective symbols are included.  Some authors use C''pq'', instead of →, and E''pq'', instead of ↔, especially in contexts where → is used for other purposes. Moreover, the horseshoe ⊃ may replace →; the triple-bar ≡ may replace ↔; a tilde (~), N''p'', or F''pq'', may replace ¬; ''||'', or A''pq'' may replace ∨; and &amp;, K''pq'', or the middle dot, ⋅, may replace [[∧]], especially if these symbols are not available for technical reasons. (''Note'': the aforementioned symbols C''pq'', E''pq'', N''p'', A''pq'', and K''pq'' are used in [[Polish notation]].)
* Parentheses, brackets, and other punctuation symbols. The choice of such symbols varies depending on context.
* An infinite set of '''variables''', often denoted by lowercase letters at the end of the alphabet ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ... . Subscripts are often used to distinguish variables: {{nowrap|1= ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...&amp;nbsp;.}}
* An '''equality symbol''' (sometimes, '''identity symbol''') =; see [[#Equality_and_its_axioms|the section on equality below]].

It should be noted that not all of these symbols are required – only one of the quantifiers, negation and conjunction, variables, brackets and equality suffice. There are numerous minor variations that may define additional logical symbols:
* Sometimes the truth constants T, V''pq'', or ⊤, for "true" and F, O''pq'', or ⊥, for "false" are included. Without any such logical operators of valence 0, these two constants can only be expressed using quantifiers.
* Sometimes additional logical connectives are included, such as the [[Sheffer stroke]], D''pq'' (NAND), and [[exclusive or]], J''pq''.

====Non-logical symbols====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Axiom of empty set]] --&gt;
The [[non-logical symbols]] represent predicates (relations), functions and constants on the domain of discourse. It used to be standard practice to use a fixed, infinite set of non-logical symbols for all purposes. A more recent practice is to use different non-logical symbols according to the application one has in mind. Therefore, it has become necessary to name the set of all non-logical symbols used in a particular application. This choice is made via a '''[[signature (logic)|signature]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;The word ''language'' is sometimes used as a synonym for signature, but this can be confusing because "language" can also refer to the set of formulas.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional approach is to have only one, infinite, set of non-logical symbols (one signature) for all applications. Consequently, under the traditional approach there is only one language of first-order logic.&lt;ref&gt;More precisely, there is only one language of each variant of one-sorted first-order logic: with or without equality, with or without functions, with or without propositional variables, ....&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is still common, especially in philosophically oriented books.
# For every integer ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 there is a collection of [[arity|''n''-'''ary''']], or ''n''-'''place''', '''predicate symbols'''. Because they represent [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] between ''n'' elements, they are also called '''relation symbols'''. For each arity ''n'' we have an infinite supply of them:
#:''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...
# For every integer ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 there are infinitely many ''n''-ary '''function symbols''':
#:''f&lt;sup&gt; n&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f&lt;sup&gt; n&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f&lt;sup&gt; n&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f&lt;sup&gt; n&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...

In contemporary mathematical logic, the signature varies by application. Typical signatures in mathematics are {1, ×} or just {×} for [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, or {0, 1, +, ×, &lt;} for [[ordered field]]s. There are no restrictions on the number of non-logical symbols. The signature can be [[empty set|empty]], finite, or infinite, even [[uncountable]]. Uncountable signatures occur for example in modern proofs of the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]].

In this approach, every non-logical symbol is of one of the following types.
# A '''predicate symbol''' (or '''relation symbol''') with some '''valence''' (or '''arity''', number of arguments) greater than or equal to 0. These are often denoted by uppercase letters ''P'', ''Q'', ''R'',... .
#* Relations of valence 0 can be identified with [[propositional variable]]s. For example, ''P'', which can stand for any statement.
#* For example, ''P''(''x'') is a predicate variable of valence 1. One possible interpretation is "''x'' is a man".
#* ''Q''(''x'',''y'') is a predicate variable of valence 2. Possible interpretations include "''x'' is greater than ''y''" and "''x'' is the father of ''y''".
# A '''function symbol''', with some valence greater than or equal to 0. These are often denoted by lowercase letters ''f'', ''g'', ''h'',... .
#* Examples: ''f''(''x'') may be interpreted as for "the father of ''x''". In [[arithmetic]], it may stand for "-x". In [[set theory]], it may stand for "the [[power set]] of x". In arithmetic, ''g''(''x'',''y'') may stand for "''x''+''y''". In set theory, it may stand for "the union of ''x'' and ''y''".
#* Function symbols of valence 0 are called '''constant symbols''', and are often denoted by lowercase letters at the beginning of the alphabet ''a'', ''b'', ''c'',... . The symbol ''a'' may stand for Socrates. In arithmetic, it may stand for 0. In set theory, such a constant may stand for the empty set.

The traditional approach can be recovered in the modern approach by simply specifying the "custom" signature to consist of the traditional sequences of non-logical symbols.

===Formation rules===
The [[formation rule]]s define the terms and formulas of first order logic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Smullyan|Smullyan, R. M.]], ''First-order Logic'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Dover Publications]], 1968), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kgvhQ-oSZiUC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 5].&lt;/ref&gt; When terms and formulas are represented as strings of symbols, these rules can be used to write a [[formal grammar]] for terms and formulas. These rules are generally [[Context-free grammar|context-free]] (each production has a single symbol on the left side), except that the set of symbols may be allowed to be infinite and there may be many start symbols, for example the variables in the case of [[First-order logic#Terms|terms]].

====Terms====
The set of '''[[Term (mathematics)|terms]]''' is [[inductive definition|inductively defined]] by the following rules:
# '''Variables.''' Any variable is a term.
# '''Functions.''' Any expression ''f''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) of ''n'' arguments (where each argument ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a term and ''f'' is a function symbol of valence ''n'') is a term. In particular, symbols denoting individual constants are nullary function symbols, and are thus terms.
Only expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1 and 2 are terms. For example, no expression involving a predicate symbol is a term.

====Formulas====
The set of '''[[formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]]''' (also called '''well-formed formulas'''&lt;ref&gt;Some authors who use the term "well-formed formula" use "formula" to mean any string of symbols from the alphabet. However, most authors in mathematical logic use "formula" to mean "well-formed formula" and have no term for non-well-formed formulas. In every context, it is only the well-formed formulas that are of interest.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''WFFs''') is inductively defined by the following rules:
# '''Predicate symbols.''' If ''P'' is an ''n''-ary predicate symbol and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are terms then ''P''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) is a formula.
# '''[[logical equality|Equality]].''' If the equality symbol is considered part of logic, and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are terms, then ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a formula.
# '''Negation.''' If φ is a formula, then &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;φ is a formula.
# '''Binary connectives.''' If φ and ψ are formulas, then (φ &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ψ) is a formula. Similar rules apply to other binary logical connectives.
# '''Quantifiers.''' If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;  is a formula and ''x'' is a variable, then &lt;math&gt;\forall x \varphi&lt;/math&gt; (for all x, &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; holds) and &lt;math&gt;\exists x \varphi&lt;/math&gt; (there exists x such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;) are formulas.
Only expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1–5 are formulas. The formulas obtained from the first two rules are said to be '''[[atomic formula]]s'''.

For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y (P(f(x)) \rightarrow\neg (P(x) \rightarrow Q(f(y),x,z)))&lt;/math&gt;
is a formula, if ''f'' is a unary function symbol, ''P'' a unary predicate symbol, and Q a ternary predicate symbol. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;\forall x\, x \rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is not a formula, although it is a string of symbols from the alphabet.

The role of the parentheses in the definition is to ensure that any formula can only be obtained in one way by following the inductive definition (in other words, there is a unique [[parse tree]] for each formula). This property is known as '''unique readability''' of formulas. There are many conventions for where parentheses are used in formulas. For example, some authors use colons or full stops instead of parentheses, or change the places in which parentheses are inserted. Each author's particular definition must be accompanied by a proof of unique readability.

This definition of a formula does not support defining an if-then-else function &lt;tt&gt;ite(c, a, b)&lt;/tt&gt;, where "c" is a condition expressed as a formula, that would return "a" if c is true, and "b" if it is false. This is because both predicates and functions can only accept terms as parameters, but the first parameter is a formula.  Some languages built on first-order logic, such as SMT-LIB 2.0, add this.&lt;ref&gt;The SMT-LIB Standard: Version 2.0, by Clark Barrett, Aaron Stump, and Cesare Tinelli.  http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/language.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notational conventions====
For convenience, conventions have been developed about the precedence of the logical operators, to avoid the need to write parentheses in some cases. These rules are similar to the [[order of operations]] in arithmetic. A common convention is:
* &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; is evaluated first
* &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; are evaluated next
* Quantifiers are evaluated next
* &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; is evaluated last.
Moreover, extra punctuation not required by the definition may be inserted to make formulas easier to read. Thus the formula
:&lt;math&gt;(\lnot \forall x P(x) \to \exists x \lnot P(x))&lt;/math&gt;
might be written as
:&lt;math&gt;(\lnot [\forall x P(x)]) \to \exists x [\lnot P(x)].&lt;/math&gt;

In some fields, it is common to use infix notation for binary relations and functions, instead of the prefix notation defined above. For example, in arithmetic, one typically writes "2 + 2 = 4" instead of "=(+(2,2),4)". It is common to regard formulas in infix notation as abbreviations for the corresponding formulas in prefix notation, cf. also [[Term (logic)#Term structure vs. representation|term structure vs. representation]].

The definitions above use infix notation for binary connectives such as &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt;. A less common convention is [[Polish notation]], in which one writes &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;, and so on in front of their arguments rather than between them. This convention allows all punctuation symbols to be discarded. Polish notation is compact and elegant, but rarely used in practice because it is hard for humans to read it. In Polish notation, the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y (P(f(x)) \rightarrow\neg (P(x) \rightarrow Q(f(y),x,z)))&lt;/math&gt;
becomes {{nowrap|1="∀x∀y→Pfx¬→ PxQfyxz".}}

===&lt;span id="sentence"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Free and bound variables===
{{Main article|Free variables and bound variables}}

In a formula, a variable may occur '''free''' or '''bound''' (or both). Intuitively, a variable occurrence is free in a formula if it is not quantified: in &lt;math&gt;\forall y\, P(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, the sole occurrence of variable ''x'' is free while that of ''y'' is bound. The free and bound variable occurrences in a formula are defined inductively as follows.
# '''Atomic formulas.''' If φ is an atomic formula then ''x'' occurs free in φ if and only if ''x'' occurs in φ. Moreover, there are no bound variables in any atomic formula.
# '''Negation.''' ''x'' occurs free in &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;φ if and only if ''x'' occurs free in φ. ''x'' occurs bound in &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;φ if and only if ''x'' occurs bound in φ.
# '''Binary connectives.''' ''x'' occurs free in (φ &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ψ) if and only if ''x'' occurs free in either φ or ψ. ''x'' occurs bound in (φ &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ψ) if and only if ''x'' occurs bound in either φ or ψ. The same rule applies to any other binary connective in place of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Quantifiers.''' ''x'' occurs free in &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;''y'' φ if and only if x occurs free in φ and ''x'' is a different symbol from ''y''. Also, ''x'' occurs bound in &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;''y'' φ if and only if ''x'' is ''y'' or ''x'' occurs bound in φ.  The same rule holds with &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, in &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;''x'' &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;''y'' (''P''(''x'')&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''Q''(''x'',''f''(''x''),''z'')), ''x'' and ''y'' occur only bound,&lt;ref&gt;''y'' occurs bound by rule 4, although it doesn't appear in any atomic subformula&lt;/ref&gt;  ''z'' occurs only free, and ''w'' is neither because it does not occur in the formula.

Free and bound variables of a formula need not be disjoint sets: in the formula &lt;math&gt;P(x) \rightarrow \forall x\, Q(x)&lt;/math&gt;, the first occurrence of ''x'', as argument of ''P'', is free while the second one, as argument of ''Q'', is bound.

A formula in first-order logic with no free variable occurrences is called a '''first-order [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]'''. These are the formulas that will have well-defined [[truth value]]s under an interpretation. For example, whether a formula such as Phil(''x'') is true must depend on what ''x'' represents. But the sentence &lt;math&gt;\exists x \operatorname{Phil}(x)&lt;/math&gt; will be either true or false in a given interpretation.

===Example: ordered abelian groups===
In mathematics the language of ordered [[abelian groups]] has one constant symbol 0, one unary function symbol −, one binary function symbol +, and one binary relation symbol ≤. Then:
*The expressions +(''x'', ''y'') and +(''x'', +(''y'', −(''z''))) are '''terms'''. These are usually written as ''x'' + ''y'' and ''x'' + ''y'' − ''z''.
*The expressions +(''x'', ''y'') = 0 and ≤(+(''x'', +(''y'', −(''z''))), +(''x'', ''y'')) are '''atomic formulas'''. These are usually written as ''x'' + ''y'' = 0 and ''x'' + ''y'' − ''z'' &amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp; ''x'' + ''y''.
*The expression &lt;math&gt;(\forall x \forall y \, [\mathop{\leq}(\mathop{+}(x, y), z) \to \forall x\, \forall y\, \mathop{+}(x, y) = 0)]&lt;/math&gt; is a '''formula''', which is usually written as &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y ( x + y \leq z) \to \forall x \forall y (x+y = 0).&lt;/math&gt; This formula has one free variable, ''z''.

The axioms for ordered abelian groups can be expressed as a set of sentences in the language. For example, the axiom stating that the group is commutative is usually written &lt;math&gt;(\forall x)(\forall y)[x+ y = y + x].&lt;/math&gt;

==Semantics==
An [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of a first-order language assigns a denotation to all non-logical symbols in that language. It also determines a [[domain of discourse]] that specifies the range of the quantifiers. The result is that each term is assigned an object that it represents, and each sentence is assigned a truth value. In this way, an interpretation provides semantic meaning to the terms and formulas of the language. The study of the interpretations of formal languages is called [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]]. What follows is a description of the standard or [[Truth definition#Tarski.27s Theory|Tarskian]] semantics for first-order logic. (It is also possible to define [[Game semantics#Classical logic|game semantics for first-order logic]], but aside from requiring the [[axiom of choice]], game semantics agree with Tarskian semantics for first-order logic, so game semantics will not be elaborated herein.)

The domain of discourse ''D'' is a nonempty set of "objects" of some kind. Intuitively, a first-order formula is a statement about these objects; for example, &lt;math&gt;\exists x P(x)&lt;/math&gt; states the existence of an object ''x'' such that the predicate ''P'' is true where referred to it. The domain of discourse is the set of considered objects. For example, one can take &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of integer numbers.

The interpretation of a function symbol is a function. For example, if the domain of discourse consists of integers, a function symbol ''f'' of arity 2 can be interpreted as the function that gives the sum of its arguments. In other words, the symbol ''f'' is associated with the function ''I(f)'' which, in this interpretation, is addition.

The interpretation of a constant symbol is a function from the one-element set ''D''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to ''D'', which can be simply identified with an object in ''D''. For example, an interpretation may assign the value &lt;math&gt;I(c)=10&lt;/math&gt; to the constant symbol &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

The interpretation of an ''n''-ary predicate symbol is a set of ''n''-tuples of elements of the domain of discourse. This means that, given an interpretation, a predicate symbol, and ''n'' elements of the domain of discourse, one can tell whether the predicate is true of those elements according to the given interpretation. For example, an interpretation ''I(P)'' of a binary predicate symbol ''P'' may be the set of pairs of integers such that the first one is less than the second. According to this interpretation, the predicate ''P'' would be true if its first argument is less than the second.

===First-order structures===
{{Main article|Structure (mathematical logic)}}

The most common way of specifying an interpretation (especially in mathematics) is to specify a '''structure''' (also called a '''model'''; see below). The structure consists of a nonempty set ''D'' that forms the domain of discourse and an interpretation ''I'' of the non-logical terms of the signature.  This interpretation is itself a function:
* Each function symbol ''f'' of arity ''n'' is assigned a function ''I(f)'' from &lt;math&gt;D^n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, each constant symbol of the signature is assigned an individual in the domain of discourse.
* Each predicate symbol ''P'' of arity ''n'' is assigned a relation ''I(P)'' over &lt;math&gt;D^n&lt;/math&gt; or, equivalently, a function from &lt;math&gt;D^n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \{\mathrm{true, false}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus each predicate symbol is interpreted by a [[Boolean-valued function]] on ''D''.

===Evaluation of truth values===
A formula evaluates to true or false given an interpretation, and a '''variable assignment''' μ that associates an element of the domain of discourse with each variable. The reason that a variable assignment is required is to give meanings to formulas with free variables, such as &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt;. The truth value of this formula changes depending on whether ''x'' and ''y'' denote the same individual.

First, the variable assignment μ can be extended to all terms of the language, with the result that each term maps to a single element of the domain of discourse. The following rules are used to make this assignment:
# '''Variables.''' Each variable ''x'' evaluates to μ(''x'')
# '''Functions.''' Given terms &lt;math&gt;t_1, \ldots, t_n&lt;/math&gt; that have been evaluated to elements &lt;math&gt;d_1, \ldots, d_n&lt;/math&gt; of the domain of discourse, and a ''n''-ary function symbol ''f'', the term &lt;math&gt;f(t_1, \ldots, t_n)&lt;/math&gt; evaluates to &lt;math&gt;(I(f))(d_1,\ldots,d_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Next, each formula is assigned a truth value. The inductive definition used to make this assignment is called the [[T-schema]].
# '''Atomic formulas (1).''' A formula &lt;math&gt;P(t_1,\ldots,t_n)&lt;/math&gt; is associated the value true or false depending on whether &lt;math&gt;\langle v_1,\ldots,v_n \rangle \in I(P)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;v_1,\ldots,v_n&lt;/math&gt; are the evaluation of the terms &lt;math&gt;t_1,\ldots,t_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I(P)&lt;/math&gt; is the interpretation of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, which by assumption is a subset of &lt;math&gt;D^n&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Atomic formulas (2).''' A formula &lt;math&gt;t_1 = t_2&lt;/math&gt; is assigned true if &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; evaluate to the same object of the domain of discourse (see the section on equality below).
# '''Logical connectives.''' A formula in the form &lt;math&gt;\neg \phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi \rightarrow
\psi&lt;/math&gt;, etc. is evaluated according to the [[truth table]] for the connective in question, as in propositional logic.
# '''Existential quantifiers.''' A formula &lt;math&gt;\exists x \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true according to ''M'' and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; if there exists an evaluation &lt;math&gt;\mu'&lt;/math&gt; of the variables that only differs from &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; regarding the evaluation of ''x'' and such that φ is true according to the interpretation ''M'' and the variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mu'&lt;/math&gt;. This formal definition captures the idea that &lt;math&gt;\exists x \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true if and only if there is a way to choose a value for ''x'' such that φ(''x'') is satisfied.
# '''Universal quantifiers.''' A formula &lt;math&gt;\forall x \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true according to ''M'' and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; if φ(''x'') is true for every pair composed by the interpretation ''M'' and some variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mu'&lt;/math&gt; that differs from &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; only on the value of ''x''. This captures the idea that &lt;math&gt;\forall x \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true if every possible choice of a value for ''x'' causes φ(''x'') to be true.

If a formula does not contain free variables, and so is a sentence, then the initial variable assignment does not affect its truth value. In other words, a sentence is true according to ''M'' and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is true according to ''M'' and every other variable assignment &lt;math&gt;\mu'&lt;/math&gt;.

There is a second common approach to defining truth values that does not rely on variable assignment functions. Instead, given an interpretation ''M'', one first adds to the signature a collection of constant symbols, one for each element of the domain of discourse in ''M''; say that for each ''d'' in the domain the constant symbol ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; is fixed. The interpretation is extended so that each new constant symbol is assigned to its corresponding element of the domain. One now defines truth for quantified formulas syntactically, as follows:
# '''Existential quantifiers (alternate).''' A formula &lt;math&gt;\exists x \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true according to ''M'' if there is some ''d'' in the domain of discourse such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(c_d)&lt;/math&gt; holds. Here &lt;math&gt;\phi(c_d)&lt;/math&gt; is the result of substituting  ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; for every free occurrence of ''x'' in φ.
# '''Universal quantifiers (alternate).''' A formula &lt;math&gt;\forall x \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true according to ''M'' if, for every ''d'' in the domain of discourse, &lt;math&gt;\phi(c_d)&lt;/math&gt; is true according to ''M''.
This alternate approach gives exactly the same truth values to all sentences as the approach via variable assignments.

===Validity, satisfiability, and logical consequence===
{{see also|Satisfiability}}
If a sentence φ evaluates to True under a given interpretation ''M'', one says that ''M'' '''satisfies''' φ; this is denoted &lt;math&gt;M \vDash \varphi&lt;/math&gt;. A sentence is '''satisfiable''' if there is some interpretation under which it is true.

Satisfiability of formulas with free variables is more complicated, because an interpretation on its own does not determine the truth value of such a formula. The most common convention is that a formula with free variables is said to be satisfied by an interpretation if the formula remains true regardless which individuals from the domain of discourse are assigned to its free variables. This has the same effect as saying that a formula is satisfied if and only if its [[universal closure]] is satisfied.

A formula is '''logically valid''' (or simply '''valid''') if it is true in every interpretation. These formulas play a role similar to [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] in propositional logic.

A formula φ is a '''logical consequence''' of a formula ψ if every interpretation that makes ψ true also makes φ true. In this case one says that φ is logically implied by ψ.

===Algebraizations===
An alternate approach to the semantics of first-order logic proceeds via [[abstract algebra]]. This approach generalizes the  [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]]s of propositional logic.  There are three ways of eliminating quantified variables from first-order logic that do not involve replacing quantifiers with other variable binding term operators:
*[[Cylindric algebra]], by [[Alfred Tarski]] and his coworkers;
*[[Polyadic algebra]], by [[Paul Halmos]];
*[[Predicate functor logic]], mainly due to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Willard Quine]].
These [[algebra]]s are all [[lattice (order)|lattices]] that properly extend the [[two-element Boolean algebra]].

Tarski and Givant (1987) showed that the fragment of first-order logic that has no [[atomic sentence]] lying in the scope of more than three quantifiers has the same expressive power as [[relation algebra]]. This fragment is of great interest because it suffices for [[Peano arithmetic]] and most [[axiomatic set theory]], including the canonical [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]. They also prove that first-order logic with a primitive [[ordered pair]] is equivalent to a relation algebra with two ordered pair [[projection function]]s.

===First-order theories, models, and elementary classes===
A '''first-order theory''' of a particular signature is a set of [[axiom]]s, which are sentences consisting of symbols from that signature. The set of axioms is often finite or [[recursively enumerable]], in which case the theory is called '''effective'''. Some authors require theories to also include all logical consequences of the axioms. The axioms are considered to hold within the theory and from them other sentences that hold within the theory can be derived.

A first-order structure that satisfies all sentences in a given theory is said to be a '''model''' of the theory. An '''[[elementary class]]''' is the set of all structures satisfying a particular theory. These classes are a main subject of study in [[model theory]].

Many theories have an '''[[intended interpretation]]''', a certain model that is kept in mind when studying the theory. For example, the intended interpretation of [[Peano arithmetic]] consists of the usual [[natural number]]s with their usual operations. However, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that most first-order theories will also have other, [[nonstandard model]]s.

A theory is '''[[consistency|consistent]]''' if it is not possible to prove a contradiction from the axioms of the theory. A theory is '''[[complete theory|complete]]''' if, for every formula in its signature, either that formula or its negation is a logical consequence of the axioms of the theory. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] shows that effective first-order theories that include a sufficient portion of the theory of the natural numbers can never be both consistent and complete.

For more information on this subject see [[List of first-order theories]] and [[Theory (mathematical logic)]]

===Empty domains===
{{Main article|Empty domain}}
The definition above requires that the domain of discourse of any interpretation must be a nonempty set. There are settings, such as [[inclusive logic]], where empty domains are permitted. Moreover, if a class of algebraic structures includes an empty structure (for example, there is an empty [[poset]]), that class can only be an elementary class in first-order logic if empty domains are permitted or the empty structure is removed from the class.

There are several difficulties with empty domains, however:
* Many common rules of inference are only valid when the domain of discourse is required to be nonempty. One example is the rule stating that &lt;math&gt;\phi \lor \exists x \psi&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\exists x (\phi \lor \psi)&lt;/math&gt; when ''x'' is not a free variable in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. This rule, which is used to put formulas into [[prenex normal form]], is sound in nonempty domains, but unsound if the empty domain is permitted.
* The definition of truth in an interpretation that uses a variable assignment function cannot work with empty domains, because there are no variable assignment functions whose range is empty. (Similarly, one cannot assign interpretations to constant symbols.) This truth definition requires that one must select a variable assignment function (μ above) before truth values for even atomic formulas can be defined. Then the truth value of a sentence is defined to be its truth value under any variable assignment, and it is proved that this truth value does not depend on which assignment is chosen. This technique does not work if there are no assignment functions at all; it must be changed to accommodate empty domains.
Thus, when the empty domain is permitted, it must often be treated as a special case. Most authors, however, simply exclude the empty domain by definition.

==Deductive systems==
A '''deductive system''' is used to demonstrate, on a purely syntactic basis, that one formula is a logical consequence of another formula. There are many such systems for first-order logic, including [[Hilbert-style deductive system]]s, [[natural deduction]], the [[sequent calculus]], the [[Method of analytic tableaux|tableaux method]], and [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]]. These share the common property that a deduction is a finite syntactic object; the format of this object, and the way it is constructed, vary widely.  These finite deductions themselves are often called '''derivations''' in proof theory. They are also often called proofs, but are completely formalized unlike natural-language [[mathematical proofs]].

A deductive system is '''sound''' if any formula that can be derived in the system is logically valid. Conversely, a deductive system is '''complete''' if every logically valid formula is derivable. All of the systems discussed in this article are both sound and complete. They also share the property that it is possible to effectively verify that a purportedly valid deduction is actually a deduction; such deduction systems are called '''effective'''.

A key property of deductive systems is that they are purely syntactic, so that derivations can be verified without considering any interpretation. Thus a sound argument is correct in every possible interpretation of the language, regardless whether that interpretation is about mathematics, economics, or some other area.

In general, logical consequence in first-order logic is only [[semidecidability|semidecidable]]: if a sentence A logically implies a sentence B then this can be discovered (for example, by searching for a proof until one is found, using some effective, sound, complete proof system). However, if A does not logically imply B, this does not mean that A logically implies the negation of B. There is no effective procedure that, given formulas A and B, always correctly decides whether A logically implies B.

===Rules of inference===
{{Further information|List of rules of inference}}
A '''[[rule of inference]]''' states that, given a particular formula (or set of formulas) with a certain property as a hypothesis, another specific formula (or set of formulas) can be derived as a conclusion. The rule is sound (or truth-preserving) if it preserves validity in the sense that whenever any interpretation satisfies the hypothesis, that interpretation also satisfies the conclusion.

For example, one common rule of inference is the '''rule of substitution'''. If ''t'' is a term and φ is a formula possibly containing the variable ''x'', then φ[''t''/''x''] is the result of replacing all free instances of ''x'' by ''t'' in φ. The substitution rule states that for any φ and any term ''t'', one can conclude φ[''t''/''x''] from φ provided that no free variable of ''t'' becomes bound during the substitution process. (If some free variable of ''t'' becomes bound, then to substitute ''t'' for ''x'' it is first necessary to change the bound variables of φ to differ from the free variables of ''t''.)

To see why the restriction on bound variables is necessary, consider the logically valid formula φ given by &lt;math&gt;\exists x (x = y)&lt;/math&gt;, in the signature of (0,1,+,×,=) of arithmetic. If ''t'' is the term "x + 1", the formula φ[''t''/''y''] is &lt;math&gt;\exists x ( x = x+1)&lt;/math&gt;, which will be false in many interpretations. The problem is that the free variable ''x'' of ''t''  became bound during the substitution. The intended replacement can be obtained by renaming the bound variable ''x'' of φ to something else, say ''z'', so that the formula after substitution is &lt;math&gt;\exists z ( z = x+1)&lt;/math&gt;, which is again logically valid.

The substitution rule demonstrates several common aspects of rules of inference. It is entirely syntactical; one can tell whether it was correctly applied without appeal to any interpretation. It has (syntactically defined) limitations on when it can be applied, which must be respected to preserve the correctness of derivations. Moreover, as is often the case, these limitations are necessary because of interactions between free and bound variables that occur during syntactic manipulations of the formulas involved in the inference rule.

===Hilbert-style systems and natural deduction===
A deduction in a Hilbert-style deductive system is a list of formulas, each of which is a '''logical axiom''', a hypothesis that has been assumed for the derivation at hand, or follows from previous formulas via a rule of inference. The logical axioms consist of several [[axiom schema]]s of logically valid formulas; these encompass a significant amount of propositional logic. The rules of inference enable the manipulation of quantifiers. Typical Hilbert-style systems have a small number of rules of inference, along with several infinite schemas of logical axioms. It is common to have only [[modus ponens]] and [[universal generalization]] as rules of inference.

Natural deduction systems resemble Hilbert-style systems in that a deduction is a finite list of formulas. However, natural deduction systems have no logical axioms; they compensate by adding additional rules of inference that can be used to manipulate the logical connectives in formulas in the proof.

===Sequent calculus===
{{Further information | Sequent calculus}}

The sequent calculus was developed to study the properties of natural deduction systems. Instead of working with one formula at a time, it uses  '''sequents''', which are expressions of the form
:&lt;math&gt;A_1, \ldots, A_n \vdash B_1, \ldots, B_k,&lt;/math&gt;
where A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., B&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are formulas and the turnstile symbol &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is used as punctuation to separate the two halves. Intuitively, a sequent expresses the idea that &lt;math&gt;(A_1 \land \cdots\land A_n)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;(B_1\lor\cdots\lor B_k)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Tableaux method===
[[File:Prop-tableau-4.svg|thumb|right|150px|A tableaux proof for the [[propositional logic|propositional]] formula {{nowrap|1=((a ∨ ¬b) Λ b) → a.}}]]

{{Further information | Method of analytic tableaux}}

Unlike the methods just described, the derivations in the tableaux method are not lists of formulas. Instead, a derivation is a tree of formulas. To show that a formula A is provable, the tableaux method attempts to demonstrate that the negation of A is unsatisfiable. The tree of the derivation has &lt;math&gt;\lnot A&lt;/math&gt; at its root; the tree branches in a way that reflects the structure of the formula. For example, to show that &lt;math&gt;C \lor D&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable requires showing that C and D are each unsatisfiable; this corresponds to a branching point in the tree with parent &lt;math&gt;C \lor D&lt;/math&gt; and children C and D.

===Resolution===
The [[resolution (logic)|resolution rule]] is a single rule of inference that, together with [[Unification (computing)#Definition of unification for first-order logic|unification]], is sound and complete for first-order logic. As with the tableaux method, a formula is proved by showing that the negation of the formula is unsatisfiable. Resolution is commonly used in automated theorem proving.

The resolution method works only with formulas that are disjunctions of atomic formulas; arbitrary formulas must first be converted to this form through [[Skolemization]]. The resolution rule states that from the hypotheses &lt;math&gt;A_1 \lor\cdots\lor A_k \lor C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_1\lor\cdots\lor B_l\lor\lnot C&lt;/math&gt;, the conclusion &lt;math&gt;A_1\lor\cdots\lor A_k\lor B_1\lor\cdots\lor B_l&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained.

===Provable identities===
Many identities can be proved, which establish equivalences between particular formulas. These identities allow for rearranging formulas by moving quantifiers across other connectives, and are useful for putting formulas in [[prenex normal form]]. Some provable identities include:
:&lt;math&gt;\lnot \forall x \, P(x) \Leftrightarrow \exists x \, \lnot P(x)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lnot \exists x \, P(x) \Leftrightarrow \forall x \, \lnot P(x)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \, \forall y \, P(x,y) \Leftrightarrow \forall y \, \forall x \, P(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\exists x \, \exists y \, P(x,y) \Leftrightarrow \exists y \, \exists x \, P(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \, P(x) \land \forall x \, Q(x) \Leftrightarrow \forall x \, (P(x) \land Q(x)) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\exists x \, P(x) \lor \exists x \, Q(x) \Leftrightarrow \exists x \, (P(x) \lor Q(x)) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P \land \exists x \, Q(x) \Leftrightarrow \exists x \, (P \land Q(x)) &lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; must not occur free in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;P \lor \forall x \, Q(x) \Leftrightarrow \forall x \, (P \lor Q(x)) &lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; must not occur free in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;)

==Equality and its axioms==
There are several different conventions for using equality (or identity) in first-order logic. The most common convention, known as '''first-order logic with equality''', includes the equality symbol as a primitive logical symbol which is always interpreted as the real equality relation between members of the domain of discourse, such that the "two" given members are the same member. This approach also adds certain axioms about equality to the deductive system employed. These equality axioms are:{{cn|date=August 2017}}
# '''Reflexivity'''. For each variable ''x'', ''x'' = ''x''.
# '''Substitution for functions.''' For all variables ''x'' and ''y'', and any function symbol ''f'',
#:''x'' = ''y'' → ''f''(...,''x'',...) = ''f''(...,''y'',...).
# '''Substitution for formulas'''. For any variables ''x'' and ''y'' and any formula φ(''x''), if φ' is obtained by replacing any number of free occurrences of ''x'' in φ with ''y'', such that these remain free occurrences of ''y'', then
#:''x'' = ''y'' → (φ → φ').

These are [[axiom schema]]s, each of which specifies an infinite set of axioms. The third schema is known as '''[[Identity of indiscernibles#Indiscernibility of identicals|Leibniz's law]]''', "the principle of substitutivity", "the indiscernibility of identicals", or "the replacement property". The second schema, involving the function symbol ''f'', is (equivalent to) a special case of the third schema, using the formula
:''x'' = ''y'' → (''f''(...,''x'',...) = z → ''f''(...,''y'',...) = z).

Many other properties of equality are consequences of the axioms above, for example:
# '''Symmetry.''' If ''x'' = ''y'' then ''y'' = ''x''.
# '''Transitivity.''' If ''x'' = ''y'' and ''y'' = ''z'' then ''x'' = ''z''.

===First-order logic without equality===
An alternate approach considers the equality relation to be a non-logical symbol. This convention is known as '''first-order logic without equality'''. If an equality relation is included in the signature, the axioms of equality must now be added to the theories under consideration, if desired, instead of being considered rules of logic. The main difference between this method and first-order logic with equality is that an interpretation may now interpret two distinct individuals as "equal" (although, by Leibniz's law, these will satisfy exactly the same formulas under any interpretation). That is, the equality relation may now be interpreted by an arbitrary [[equivalence relation]] on the domain of discourse that is [[congruence relation|congruent]] with respect to the functions and relations of the interpretation.

When this second convention is followed, the term '''normal model''' is used to refer to an interpretation where no distinct individuals ''a'' and ''b'' satisfy ''a'' = ''b''. In first-order logic with equality, only normal models are considered, and so there is no term for a model other than a normal model. When first-order logic without equality is studied, it is necessary to amend the statements of results such as the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] so that only normal models are considered.

First-order logic without equality is often employed in the context of [[second-order arithmetic]] and other higher-order theories of arithmetic, where the equality relation between sets of natural numbers is usually omitted.

===Defining equality within a theory===
If a theory has a binary formula ''A''(''x'',''y'') which satisfies reflexivity and Leibniz's law, the theory is said to have equality, or to be a theory with equality. The theory may not have all instances of the above schemas as axioms, but rather as derivable theorems. For example, in theories with no function symbols and a finite number of relations, it is possible to [[definitional extension|define]] equality in terms of the relations, by defining the two terms ''s'' and ''t'' to be equal if any relation is unchanged by changing ''s'' to ''t'' in any argument.

Some theories allow other ''ad hoc'' definitions of equality:
* In the theory of [[partial order]]s with one relation symbol ≤, one could define ''s'' = ''t'' to be an abbreviation for ''s'' ≤ ''t'' &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; ''t'' ≤ ''s''.
* In set theory with one relation &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;, one may define ''s'' = ''t'' to be an abbreviation for &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;''x'' (''s'' &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''t'' &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; ''x'') &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;''x'' (''x'' &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; ''s'' &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;  ''t''). This definition of equality then automatically satisfies the axioms for equality. In this case, one should replace the usual [[axiom of extensionality]], which can be stated as &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [ \forall z (z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y) \Rightarrow x = y]&lt;/math&gt;, with an alternative formulation &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [ \forall z (z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y) \Rightarrow \forall z (x \in z \Leftrightarrow y \in z) ]&lt;/math&gt;, which says that if  sets ''x'' and ''y'' have the same elements, then they also belong to the same sets.

==Metalogical properties==
One motivation for the use of first-order logic, rather than [[higher-order logic]], is that first-order logic has many [[metalogic]]al properties that stronger logics do not have. These results concern general properties of first-order logic itself, rather than properties of individual theories. They provide fundamental tools for the construction of models of first-order theories.

===Completeness and undecidability===
[[Gödel's completeness theorem]], proved by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1929, establishes that there are sound, complete, effective deductive systems for first-order logic, and thus the first-order logical consequence relation is captured by finite provability. Naively, the statement that a formula φ logically implies a formula ψ depends on every model of φ; these models will in general be of arbitrarily large cardinality, and so logical consequence cannot be effectively verified by checking every model. However, it is possible to enumerate all finite derivations and search for a derivation of ψ from φ. If ψ is logically implied by φ, such a derivation will eventually be found. Thus first-order logical consequence is [[semidecidable]]: it is possible to make an effective enumeration of all pairs of sentences (φ,ψ) such that ψ is a logical consequence of&amp;nbsp;φ.

Unlike [[propositional logic]], first-order logic is [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]] (although semidecidable), provided that the language has at least one predicate of arity at least 2 (other than equality). This means that there is no [[decision procedure]] that determines whether arbitrary formulas are logically valid. This result was established independently by [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] in 1936 and 1937, respectively, giving a negative answer to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] posed by [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Their proofs demonstrate a connection between the unsolvability of the decision problem for first-order logic and the unsolvability of the [[halting problem]].

There are systems weaker than full first-order logic for which the logical consequence relation is decidable. These include propositional logic and [[monadic predicate logic]], which is first-order logic restricted to unary predicate symbols and no function symbols. Other logics with no function symbols which are decidable are the [[guarded fragment]] of first-order logic, as well as [[two-variable logic]]. The [[Bernays–Schönfinkel class]] of first-order formulas is also decidable. Decidable subsets of first-order logic are also studied in the framework of [[description logics]].

===The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem===
The [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] shows that if a first-order theory of [[cardinality]] λ has an infinite model, then it has models of every infinite cardinality greater than or equal to λ. One of the earliest results in [[model theory]], it implies that it is not possible to characterize [[countable set|countability]] or uncountability in a first-order language. That is, there is no first-order formula φ(''x'') such that an arbitrary structure M satisfies φ if and only if the domain of discourse of M is countable (or, in the second case, uncountable).

The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies that infinite structures cannot be [[categorical theory|categorically]] axiomatized in first-order logic. For example, there is no first-order theory whose only model is the real line: any first-order theory with an infinite model also has a model of cardinality larger than the continuum. Since the real line is infinite, any theory satisfied by the real line is also satisfied by some [[nonstandard model]]s. When the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem is applied to first-order set theories, the nonintuitive consequences are known as [[Skolem's paradox]].

===The compactness theorem===
The [[compactness theorem]] states that a set of first-order sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset of it has a model. This implies that if a formula is a logical consequence of an infinite set of first-order axioms, then it is a logical consequence of some finite number of those axioms. This theorem was proved first by Kurt Gödel as a consequence of the completeness theorem, but many additional proofs have been obtained over time. It is a central tool in model theory, providing a fundamental method for constructing models.

The compactness theorem has a limiting effect on which collections of first-order structures are elementary classes. For example, the compactness theorem implies that any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models has an infinite model. Thus the class of all finite [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] is not an elementary class (the same holds for many other algebraic structures).

There are also more subtle limitations of first-order logic that are implied by the compactness theorem. For example, in computer science, many situations can be modeled as a [[directed graph]] of states (nodes) and connections (directed edges).  Validating such a system may require showing that no "bad" state can be reached from any "good" state. Thus one seeks to determine if the good and bad states are in different [[connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] of the graph. However, the compactness theorem can be used to show that connected graphs are not an elementary class in first-order logic, and there is no formula φ(''x'',''y'') of first-order logic, in the [[logic of graphs]], that expresses the idea that there is a path from ''x'' to ''y''. Connectedness can be expressed in [[second-order logic]], however, but not with only existential set quantifiers, as &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1^1&lt;/math&gt; also enjoys compactness.

===Lindström's theorem===
{{Main article|Lindström's theorem}}

[[Per Lindström]] showed that the metalogical properties just discussed actually characterize first-order logic in the sense that no stronger logic can also have those properties (Ebbinghaus and Flum 1994, Chapter XIII). Lindström defined a class of abstract logical systems, and a rigorous definition of the relative strength of a member of this class. He established two theorems for systems of this type:
* A logical system satisfying Lindström's definition that contains first-order logic and satisfies both the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem must be equivalent to first-order logic.
* A logical system satisfying Lindström's definition that has a semidecidable logical consequence relation and satisfies the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem must be equivalent to first-order logic.

==Limitations==
Although first-order logic is sufficient for formalizing much of mathematics, and is commonly used in computer science and other fields, it has certain limitations. These include limitations on its expressiveness and limitations of the fragments of natural languages that it can describe.

For instance, first-order logic is undecidable, meaning a sound, complete and terminating decision algorithm for provability is impossible. This has led to the study of interesting decidable fragments such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, first-order logic with two variables and the counting quantifiers &lt;math&gt;\exists^{\ge n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists^{\le n}&lt;/math&gt; (these quantifiers are, respectively, "there exists at least ''n''" and "there exists at most ''n''").&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks 2010{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expressiveness===
The [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] shows that if a first-order theory has any infinite model, then it has infinite models of every cardinality. In particular, no first-order theory with an infinite model can be [[Morley's categoricity theorem|categorical]]. Thus there is no first-order theory whose only model has the set of natural numbers as its domain, or whose only model has the set of real numbers as its domain.  Many extensions of first-order logic, including infinitary logics and higher-order logics, are more expressive in the sense that they do permit categorical axiomatizations of the natural numbers or real numbers. This expressiveness comes at a metalogical cost, however: by [[Lindström's theorem]], the compactness theorem and the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem cannot hold in any logic stronger than first-order.

===Formalizing natural languages===
First-order logic is able to formalize many simple quantifier constructions in natural language, such as "every person who lives in Perth lives in Australia". But there are many more complicated features of natural language that cannot be expressed in (single-sorted) first-order logic. "Any logical system which is appropriate as an instrument for the analysis of natural language needs a much richer structure than first-order predicate logic".&lt;ref&gt;Gamut 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restrictions, extensions, and variations==
There are many variations of first-order logic. Some of these are inessential in the sense that they merely change notation without affecting the semantics. Others change the expressive power more significantly, by extending the semantics through additional quantifiers or other new logical symbols. For example, infinitary logics permit formulas of infinite size, and modal logics add symbols for possibility and necessity.

===Restricted languages===
First-order logic can be studied in languages with fewer logical symbols than were described above.
* Because &lt;math&gt;\exists x \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\neg \forall x \neg \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\forall x \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\neg \exists x \neg \phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, either of the two quantifiers &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; can be dropped.
* Since &lt;math&gt;\phi \lor \psi&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\lnot \phi \land \lnot \psi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi \land \psi&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\lnot(\lnot \phi \lor \lnot \psi)&lt;/math&gt;, either &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; can be dropped. In other words, it is sufficient to have &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;, as the only logical connectives.
* Similarly, it is sufficient to have only &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; as logical connectives, or to have only the [[Sheffer stroke]] (NAND) or the [[Peirce arrow]] (NOR) operator.
* It is possible to entirely avoid function symbols and constant symbols, rewriting them via predicate symbols in an appropriate way. For example, instead of using a constant symbol &lt;math&gt; \; 0 &lt;/math&gt;  one may use a predicate  &lt;math&gt; \; 0(x) &lt;/math&gt;  (interpreted as  &lt;math&gt; \; x=0 &lt;/math&gt; ), and replace every predicate such as  &lt;math&gt;\; P(0,y) &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \forall x \;(0(x) \rightarrow P(x,y)) &lt;/math&gt;. A function such as &lt;math&gt; f(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) &lt;/math&gt; will similarly be replaced by a predicate  &lt;math&gt; F(x_1,x_2,...,x_n,y) &lt;/math&gt; interpreted as &lt;math&gt; y = f(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) &lt;/math&gt;. This change requires adding additional axioms to the theory at hand, so that interpretations of the predicate symbols used have the correct semantics.

Restrictions such as these are useful as a technique to reduce the number of inference rules or axiom schemas in deductive systems, which leads to shorter proofs of metalogical results. The cost of the restrictions is that it becomes more difficult to express natural-language statements in the formal system at hand, because the logical connectives used in the natural language statements must be replaced by their (longer) definitions in terms of the restricted collection of logical connectives. Similarly, derivations in the limited systems may be longer than derivations in systems that include additional connectives. There is thus a trade-off between the ease of working within the formal system and the ease of proving results about the formal system.

It is also possible to restrict the arities of function symbols and predicate symbols, in sufficiently expressive theories. One can in principle dispense entirely with functions of arity greater than 2 and predicates of arity greater than 1 in theories that include a [[pairing function]]. This is a function of arity 2 that takes pairs of elements of the domain and returns an [[ordered pair]] containing them. It is also sufficient to have two predicate symbols of arity 2 that define projection functions from an ordered pair to its components. In either case it is necessary that the natural axioms for a pairing function and its projections are satisfied.

===Many-sorted logic===
{{main|Many-sorted logic}}
{{unreferenced section|reason=delocalize "citation needed" tag; the entire second paragraph is what is challenged|date=June 2013}}
Ordinary first-order interpretations have a single domain of discourse over which all quantifiers range. '''Many-sorted first-order logic''' allows variables to have different '''sorts''', which have different domains. This is also called '''typed first-order logic''', and the sorts called '''types''' (as in [[data type]]), but it is not the same as first-order [[type theory]]. Many-sorted first-order logic is often used in the study of [[second-order arithmetic]].

When there are only finitely many sorts in a theory, many-sorted first-order logic can be reduced to single-sorted first-order logic.&lt;ref&gt;
Herbert Enderton. "A Mathematical Introduction to Logic" (2nd Edition). Academic Press, 2001, pp.296-299.&lt;/ref&gt; 
One introduces into the single-sorted theory a unary predicate symbol for each sort in the many-sorted theory, and adds an axiom saying that these unary predicates partition the domain of discourse. For example, if there are two sorts, one adds predicate symbols &lt;math&gt;P_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; and the axiom
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x ( P_1(x) \lor P_2(x)) \land \lnot \exists x (P_1(x) \land P_2(x))&lt;/math&gt;.
Then the elements satisfying &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; are thought of as elements of the first sort, and elements satisfying &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; as elements of the second sort. One can quantify over each sort by using the corresponding predicate symbol to limit the range of quantification. For example, to say there is an element of the first sort satisfying formula φ(''x''), one writes
:&lt;math&gt;\exists x (P_1(x) \land \phi(x))&lt;/math&gt;.

===Additional quantifiers===
Additional quantifiers can be added to first-order logic.
* Sometimes it is useful to say that "''P(x)'' holds for exactly one ''x''", which can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\exists!&lt;/math&gt;''x'' ''P''(''x'').  This notation, called [[uniqueness quantification]], may be taken to abbreviate a formula such as &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;''x'' (''P''(''x'')  &lt;math&gt;\wedge\forall&lt;/math&gt;''y'' (''P''(''y'') &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (''x'' = ''y''))).
*'''First-order logic with extra quantifiers''' has new quantifiers ''Qx'',..., with meanings such as "there are many ''x'' such that ...". Also see [[branching quantifier]]s and the [[plural quantification|plural quantifier]]s of [[George Boolos]] and others.
* '''[[Bounded quantifier]]s''' are often used in the study of set theory or arithmetic.

===Infinitary logics===
{{Main article|Infinitary logic}}
Infinitary logic allows infinitely long sentences. For example, one may allow a conjunction or disjunction of infinitely many formulas, or quantification over infinitely many variables. Infinitely long sentences arise in areas of mathematics including  [[topology]] and [[model theory]].

Infinitary logic generalizes first-order logic to allow formulas of infinite length. The most common way in which formulas can become infinite is through infinite conjunctions and disjunctions. However, it is also possible to admit generalized signatures in which function and relation symbols are allowed to have infinite arities, or in which quantifiers can bind infinitely many variables. Because an infinite formula cannot be represented by a finite string, it is necessary to choose some other representation of formulas; the usual representation in this context is a tree. Thus formulas are, essentially, identified with their parse trees, rather than with the strings being parsed.

The most commonly studied infinitary logics are denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;, where α and β are each either [[cardinal number]]s or the symbol ∞. In this notation, ordinary first-order logic is ''L''&lt;sub&gt;ωω&lt;/sub&gt;.
In the logic ''L''&lt;sub&gt;∞ω&lt;/sub&gt;, arbitrary conjunctions or disjunctions are allowed when building formulas, and there is an unlimited supply of variables. More generally, the logic that permits conjunctions or disjunctions with less than κ constituents is known as ''L''&lt;sub&gt;κω&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; permits [[countable set|countable]] conjunctions and disjunctions.

The set of free variables in a formula of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;κω&lt;/sub&gt; can have any cardinality strictly less than κ, yet only finitely many of them can be in the scope of any quantifier when a formula appears as a subformula of another.&lt;ref&gt;Some authors only admit formulas with finitely many free variables in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;κω&lt;/sub&gt;, and more generally only formulas with &lt;&amp;nbsp;λ free variables in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;κλ&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In other infinitary logics, a subformula may be in the scope of infinitely many quantifiers. For example, in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;κ∞&lt;/sub&gt;, a single universal or existential quantifier may bind arbitrarily many variables simultaneously. Similarly, the logic ''L''&lt;sub&gt;κλ&lt;/sub&gt; permits simultaneous quantification over fewer than λ variables, as well as conjunctions and disjunctions of size less than κ.

===Non-classical and modal logics===
*'''[[intuitionistic logic|Intuitionistic first-order logic]]''' uses intuitionistic rather than classical propositional calculus; for example, ¬¬φ need not be equivalent to φ.
*First-order '''[[modal logic]]''' allows one to describe other possible worlds as well as this contingently true world which we inhabit. In some versions, the set of possible worlds varies depending on which possible world one inhabits. Modal logic has extra ''modal operators'' with meanings which can be characterized informally as, for example  "it is necessary that φ" (true in all possible worlds) and "it is possible that φ" (true in some possible world). With standard first-order logic we have a single domain and each predicate is assigned one extension. With first-order modal logic we have a ''domain function'' that assigns each possible world its own domain, so that each predicate gets an extension only relative to these possible worlds. This allows us to model cases where, for example, Alex is a Philosopher, but might have been a Mathematician, and might not have existed at all. In the first possible world ''P''(''a'') is true, in the second ''P''(''a'') is false, and in the third possible world there is no ''a'' in the domain at all.
*'''[[t-norm fuzzy logics|first-order fuzzy logics]]''' are first-order extensions of propositional fuzzy logics rather than classical [[propositional calculus]].

===Fixpoint logic===
'''Fixpoint logic''' extends first-order logic by adding the closure under the least fixed points of positive operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Computer Science Logic: 6th Workshop, CSL'92, San Miniato, Italy, September 28 - October 2, 1992. Selected Papers | volume=702 | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | editor1-first=Egon | editor1-last=Börger | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1993 | zbl=0808.03024 | isbn=3-540-56992-8 | pages=100–114 | first=Uwe | last=Bosse | chapter=An Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé game for fixpoint logic and stratified fixpoint logic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher-order logics===
{{Main article|Higher-order logic}}

The characteristic feature of first-order logic is that individuals can be quantified, but not predicates. Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\exists a ( \text{Phil}(a))&lt;/math&gt;
is a legal first-order formula, but
:&lt;math&gt;\exists \text{Phil} ( \text{Phil}(a))&lt;/math&gt;
is not, in most formalizations of first-order logic. [[Second-order logic]] extends first-order logic by adding the latter type of quantification. Other [[higher-order logic]]s allow quantification over even higher [[type theory|types]] than second-order logic permits. These higher types include relations between relations, functions from relations to relations between relations, and other higher-type objects.  Thus the "first" in first-order logic describes the type of objects that can be quantified.

Unlike first-order logic, for which only one semantics is studied, there are several possible semantics for second-order logic. The most commonly employed semantics for second-order and higher-order logic is known as '''full semantics'''. The combination of additional quantifiers and the full semantics for these quantifiers makes higher-order logic stronger than first-order logic. In particular, the (semantic) logical consequence relation for second-order and higher-order logic is not semidecidable; there is no effective deduction system for second-order logic that is sound and complete under full semantics.

Second-order logic with full semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, it is possible to create axiom systems in second-order logic that uniquely characterize the natural numbers and the real line. The cost of this expressiveness is that second-order and higher-order logics have fewer attractive metalogical properties than first-order logic. For example, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and compactness theorem of first-order logic become false when generalized to higher-order logics with full semantics.

==Automated theorem proving and formal methods==
{{further|Automated theorem proving#First-order theorem proving}}

[[Automated theorem proving]] refers to the development of computer programs that search and find derivations (formal proofs) of mathematical theorems. Finding derivations is a difficult task because the [[search algorithm|search space]] can be very large; an exhaustive search of every possible derivation is theoretically possible but [[Computational complexity theory|computationally infeasible]] for many systems of interest in mathematics. Thus complicated [[heuristic function]]s are developed to attempt to find a derivation in less time than a blind search.

The related area of automated [[proof verification]] uses computer programs to check that human-created proofs are correct.  Unlike complicated automated theorem provers, verification systems may be small enough that their correctness can be checked both by hand and through automated software verification. This validation of the proof verifier is needed to give confidence that any derivation labeled as "correct" is actually correct.

Some proof verifiers, such as [[Metamath]], insist on having a complete derivation as input.  Others, such as [[Mizar system|Mizar]] and [[Isabelle (theorem prover)|Isabelle]], take a well-formatted proof sketch (which may still be very long and detailed) and fill in the missing pieces by doing simple proof searches or applying known decision procedures: the resulting derivation is then verified by a small, core "kernel". Many such systems are primarily intended for interactive use by human mathematicians: these are known as [[proof assistant]]s.  They may also use formal logics that are stronger than first-order logic, such as type theory. Because a full derivation of any nontrivial result in a first-order deductive system will be extremely long for a human to write,&lt;ref&gt;Avigad ''et al.'' (2007) discuss the process of formally verifying a proof of the [[prime number theorem]]. The formalized proof required approximately 30,000 lines of input to the Isabelle proof verifier.&lt;/ref&gt; results are often formalized as a series of lemmas, for which derivations can be constructed separately.

Automated theorem provers are also used to implement [[formal verification]] in computer science.  In this setting, theorem provers are used to verify the correctness of programs and of hardware such as [[CPU|processors]] with respect to a [[formal specification]]. Because such analysis is time-consuming and thus expensive, it is usually reserved for projects in which a malfunction would have grave human or financial consequences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5791">In [[mathematics]], a '''functional square root''' (sometimes called a '''half iterate''') is a [[square root]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with respect to the operation of [[function composition]]. In other words, a functional square root of a function {{math| ''g''}} is a function {{math|''f''}} satisfying {{math|1=''f''(''f''(''x'')) = ''g''(''x'')}} [[for all]] {{math|''x''}}.

==Notation==  
Notations expressing that {{math|''f''}} is a functional square root of {{math|''g''}} are {{math|1=''f'' = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;[1/2]&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|1=''f'' = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

==History==
*The functional square root of the [[exponential function]] (now known as a [[half-exponential function]]) was studied by [[Hellmuth Kneser]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="sqrtexp"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
*The solutions of {{math|1=''f''(''f''(''x'')) = ''x''}} over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]s of the real numbers) were first studied by [[Charles Babbage]] in 1815, and this equation is called Babbage's [[functional equation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Gray]] and [[Karen Parshall]] (2007) ''Episodes in the History of Modern Algebra (1800–1950)'', [[American Mathematical Society]], {{ISBN|978-0-8218-4343-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular solution is {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = (''b'' − ''x'')/(1 + ''cx'')}} for {{math|''bc'' ≠ −1}}. Babbage noted that for any given solution {{math|''f''}}, its [[Topological conjugacy|functional conjugate]] {{math|Ψ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ○ ''f'' ○ Ψ}} by an arbitrary invertible function {{math|Ψ}} is also a solution. In other words, the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of all invertible functions on the real line [[Group action|acts]] on the subgroup consisting of solutions to Babbage's functional equation by conjugation.

==Solutions==

A systematic procedure to produce ''arbitrary'' functional {{mvar|''n''}}-roots (including, beyond {{math|1=''n'' = 1/2}}, continuous, negative, and infinitesimal {{mvar|''n''}}) relies on the solutions of [[Schröder's equation]].&lt;ref name="schr"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schröder, E. |authorlink=Ernst Schröder |year=1870 |title=Ueber iterirte Functionen|journal=Mathematische Annalen |volume=3 |issue= 2|pages=296&amp;ndash;322 | doi=10.1007/BF01443992 | id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Szekeres, G.|authorlink=George Szekeres| year=1958|title=Regular iteration of real and complex functions |journal=Acta Mathematica |volume=100|issue=3–4 |pages=361–376 |doi= 10.1007/BF02559539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Curtright, T.|authorlink= Thomas Curtright| year= 2011|author2=Zachos, C. |authorlink2=Cosmas Zachos|author3=Jin, X. |title=Approximate solutions of functional equations |journal= Journal of Physics A |volume= 44|issue= 40 |pages= 405205|doi=10.1088/1751-8113/44/40/405205|arxiv=1105.3664|bibcode=2011JPhA...44N5205C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">The '''fundamental theorem of software engineering''' (FTSE) is a term originated by [[Andrew Koenig (programmer)|Andrew Koenig]] to describe a remark by [[Butler Lampson]]&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams and Gurtovoy, C++ Template Metaprogramming, 2005, Addison Wesley, p13.&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to the late [[David Wheeler (computer scientist)|David J.

The theorem does not describe an actual theorem that can be proven; rather, it is a general principle for managing complexity through [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]].

The theorem is often expanded by the humorous clause "…except for the problem of too many levels of indirection," referring to the fact that too many abstractions may create intrinsic complexity issues of their own. For example, the use of protocol layering in [[computer network]]s, which today is ubiquitous, has been criticized in ways that are typical of more general disadvantages of abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Wakeman | first1 = I. | last2=Crowcroft | first2=J. | last3=Wang | first3=Z.|last4=Sirovica|first4=D. | date = Jan 1992| title = Is Layering Harmful?| journal = IEEE Network| pages =20–24| doi = 10.1109/65.120719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the adding of extra levels of indirection may cause higher layers to [[Abstraction inversion|duplicate the functionality of lower layers]], leading to inefficiency, and functionality at one layer may need data present only at another layer, which fundamentally violates the goal of separation into different layers.

{{distinguish|general hypergeometric function}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''generalized hypergeometric series''' is a [[power series]] in which the ratio of successive [[coefficient]]s indexed by ''n'' is a [[rational function]] of ''n''. The series, if convergent,  defines a '''generalized hypergeometric function''', which may then  be defined over a wider domain of the argument by [[analytic continuation]]. The generalized hypergeometric series is sometimes just called the hypergeometric series, though this term also sometimes just refers to the [[Gaussian hypergeometric series]]. Generalized hypergeometric functions include  the (Gaussian) [[hypergeometric function]] and the [[confluent hypergeometric function]] as special cases, which in turn have many particular [[special functions]] as special cases, such as [[elementary functions]], [[Bessel function]]s, and the [[orthogonal polynomials|classical orthogonal polynomials]].

==Notation==
A hypergeometric series is formally defined as a [[power series]] 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta_0 + \beta_1 z + \beta_2 z^2 + \dots = \sum_{n \geqslant 0} \beta_n z^n&lt;/math&gt;
in which the ratio of successive coefficients is a [[rational function]] of ''n''. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\beta_{n+1}}{\beta_n} = \frac{A(n)}{B(n)}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A''(''n'') and ''B''(''n'') are [[polynomial]]s in ''n''.

For example, in the case of the series for the [[exponential function]],
:&lt;math&gt;1+\frac{z}{1!}+\frac{z^2}{2!}+\frac{z^3}{3!}+\cdots,&lt;/math&gt;
we have:
:&lt;math&gt; \beta_n = \frac{1}{n!}, \qquad \frac{\beta_{n+1}}{\beta_n} = \frac{1}{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
So this satisfies the definition with {{math|''A''(''n'') {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''B''(''n'') {{=}} ''n'' + 1}}.

It is customary to factor out the leading term, so β&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is assumed to be 1. The polynomials can be factored into linear factors of the form (''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'') and (''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'') respectively, where the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[complex numbers]].

For historical reasons, it is assumed that (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'') is a factor of ''B''. If this is not already the case then both ''A'' and ''B'' can be multiplied by this factor; the factor cancels so the terms are unchanged and there is no loss of generality.

The ratio between consecutive coefficients now has the form 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c(a_1+n)\cdots(a_p+n)}{d(b_1+n)\cdots(b_q+n)(1+n)}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''c'' and ''d'' are the leading coefficients of ''A'' and ''B''. The series then has the form
:&lt;math&gt;1 + \frac{a_1\cdots a_p}{b_1\cdots b_q \cdot 1}\frac{cz}{d} + \frac{a_1\cdots a_p}{b_1\cdots b_q \cdot 1} \frac{(a_1+1)\cdots(a_p+1)}{(b_1+1)\cdots (b_q+1) \cdot 2}\left(\frac{cz}{d}\right)^2+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;,
or, by scaling z by the appropriate factor and rearranging,
:&lt;math&gt;1 + \frac{a_1\cdots a_p}{b_1\cdots b_q}\frac{z}{1!} + \frac{a_1(a_1+1)\cdots a_p(a_p+1)}{b_1(b_1+1)\cdots b_q(b_q+1)}\frac{z^2}{2!}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;.

This has the form of an [[generating function|exponential generating function]]. This series is usually denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;{}_pF_q(a_1,\ldots,a_p;b_1,\ldots,b_q;z)&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\,{}_pF_q \left[\begin{matrix}  a_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{p} \\ b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; b_q \end{matrix} ; z \right].&lt;/math&gt;

Using the rising factorial or [[Pochhammer symbol]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(a)_0 &amp;= 1, \\
(a)_n &amp;= a(a+1)(a+2) \cdots (a+n-1), &amp;&amp; n \geq 1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

this can be written

:&lt;math&gt;\,{}_pF_q(a_1,\ldots,a_p;b_1,\ldots,b_q;z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(a_1)_n\cdots(a_p)_n}{(b_1)_n\cdots(b_q)_n} \, \frac {z^n} {n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that this use of the Pochhammer symbol is not standard; however it is the standard usage in this context.)

==Terminology==
When all the terms of the series are defined and it has a non-zero [[radius of convergence]], then the series defines an [[analytic function]]. Such a function, and its [[analytic continuation]]s, is called the '''hypergeometric function'''.

The case when the radius of convergence is 0 yields many interesting series in mathematics, for example the [[incomplete gamma function]] has the [[asymptotic expansion]]
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(a,z) \sim z^{a-1}e^{-z}\left(1+\frac{a-1}{z}+\frac{(a-1)(a-2)}{z^2} + \cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;
which could be written ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''a''−1&lt;/sup&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;−z&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1−''a'',1;;−''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). However, the use of the term ''hypergeometric series'' is usually restricted to the case where the series defines an actual analytic function.

The ordinary hypergeometric series should not be confused with the [[basic hypergeometric series]], which, despite its name, is a rather more complicated and recondite series.  The "basic" series is the [[q-analog]] of the ordinary hypergeometric series. There are several such generalizations of the ordinary hypergeometric series, including the ones coming from [[zonal spherical function]]s on [[symmetric space|Riemannian symmetric spaces]].

The series without the factor of ''n''! in the denominator (summed over all integers ''n'', including negative) is called the [[bilateral hypergeometric series]].

==Convergence conditions==
There are certain values of the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; for which the numerator or the denominator of the coefficients is 0.
* If any ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is a non-positive integer (0, −1, −2, etc.) then the series only has a finite number of terms and is, in fact, a polynomial of degree −''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* If any ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a non-positive integer (excepting the previous case with −''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) then the denominators become 0 and the series is undefined.

Excluding these cases, the [[ratio test]] can be applied to determine the radius of convergence.
* If ''p'' &amp;lt; ''q'' + 1 then the ratio of coefficients tends to zero. This implies that the series converges for any finite value of ''z'' and thus defines an entire function of ''z''. An example is the power series for the exponential function.
* If ''p'' = ''q'' + 1 then the ratio of coefficients tends to one. This implies that the series converges for |''z''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and diverges for |''z''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1. Whether it converges for |''z''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 is more difficult to determine. Analytic continuation can be employed for larger values of ''z''.
* If ''p'' &amp;gt; ''q'' + 1 then the ratio of coefficients grows without bound. This implies that, besides ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the series diverges. This is then a divergent or asymptotic series, or it can be interpreted as a symbolic shorthand for a differential equation that the sum satisfies formally.

The question of convergence for ''p''=''q''+1 when ''z'' is on the unit circle is more difficult. It can be shown that the series converges absolutely at ''z'' = 1 if 
:&lt;math&gt;\Re\left(\sum b_k - \sum a_j\right)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.
Further, if ''p''=''q''+1, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{p}a_{i}\geq\sum_{j=1}^{q}b_{j}&lt;/math&gt; and ''z'' is real, then the following convergence result holds {{harvtxt|Quigley|Wilson|Walls|Bedford|2013}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{z\rightarrow 1}(1-z)\frac{d\log(_{p}F_{q}(a_{1},\ldots,a_{p};b_{1},\ldots,b_{q};z^{p}))}{dz}=\sum_{i=1}^{p}a_{i}-\sum_{j=1}^{q}b_{j}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Basic properties==
It is immediate from the definition that the order of the parameters ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', or the order of the parameters ''b&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be changed without changing the value of the function. Also, if any of the parameters ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is equal to any of the parameters ''b&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', then the matching parameters can be "cancelled out", with certain exceptions when the parameters are non-positive integers. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\,{}_2F_1(3,1;1;z) = \,{}_2F_1(1,3;1;z) = \,{}_1F_0(3;;z)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Euler's integral transform===
The following basic identity is very useful as it relates the higher-order hypergeometric functions in terms of integrals over the lower order ones&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Slater|1966|loc=Equation (4.1.2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {}_{A+1}F_{B+1}\left[ 
\begin{array}{c}
a_{1},\ldots ,a_{A},c \\ 
b_{1},\ldots ,b_{B},d
\end{array}
;z\right] =\frac{\Gamma (d)}{\Gamma (c)\Gamma (d-c)}
\int_{0}^{1}t^{c-1}(1-t)_{{}}^{d-c-1}\ {}_{A}F_{B}\left[ 
\begin{array}{c}
a_{1},\ldots ,a_{A} \\ 
b_{1},\ldots ,b_{B}
\end{array} ; tz\right]  dt&lt;/math&gt;

===Differentiation===
The generalized hypergeometric function satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left (z\frac{{\rm{d}}}{{\rm{d}}z} + a_j \right ){}_pF_q\left[ \begin{array}{c} a_1,\dots,a_j,\dots,a_p \\ b_1,\dots,b_q\end{array} ;z\right] &amp;= a_j \; {}_pF_q\left[ \begin{array}{c} a_1,\dots,a_j+1,\dots,a_p \\ b_1,\dots,b_q \end{array} ;z\right] \\

\left (z\frac{{\rm{d}}}{{\rm{d}}z} + b_k - 1 \right ){}_pF_q\left[ \begin{array}{c} a_1,\dots,a_p \\ b_1,\dots,b_k,\dots,b_q\end{array} ;z\right] &amp;= (b_k - 1) \; {}_pF_q\left[ \begin{array}{c} a_1,\dots,a_p \\ b_1,\dots,b_k-1,\dots,b_q \end{array} ;z \right] \\
\frac{{\rm{d}}}{{\rm{d}}z} \; {}_pF_q\left[ \begin{array}{c} a_1,\dots,a_p \\ b_1,\dots,b_q \end{array} ;z \right] &amp;= \frac{\prod_{i=1}^p a_i}{\prod_{j=1}^q b_j}\; {}_pF_q\left[ \begin{array}{c} a_1+1,\dots,a_p+1 \\ b_1+1,\dots,b_q+1 \end{array} ;z \right]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining these gives a differential equation satisfied by ''w'' = &lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;z\prod_{n=1}^{p}\left(z\frac{{\rm{d}}}{{\rm{d}}z} + a_n\right)w = z\frac{{\rm{d}}}{{\rm{d}}z}\prod_{n=1}^{q}\left(z\frac{{\rm{d}}}{{\rm{d}}z} + b_n-1\right)w&lt;/math&gt;.

==Contiguous function and related identities==
Take the following operator:
:&lt;math&gt;\vartheta = z\frac{{\rm{d}}}{{\rm{d}}z}.&lt;/math&gt; 
From the differentiation formulas given above, the linear space spanned by 
:&lt;math&gt;{}_pF_q(a_1,\dots,a_p;b_1,\dots,b_q;z), \vartheta\; {}_pF_q(a_1,\dots,a_p;b_1,\dots,b_q;z)&lt;/math&gt; 
contains each of 
:&lt;math&gt;{}_pF_q(a_1,\dots,a_j+1,\dots,a_p;b_1,\dots,b_q;z),&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;{}_pF_q(a_1,\dots,a_p;b_1,\dots,b_k-1,\dots,b_q;z),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z\; {}_pF_q(a_1+1,\dots,a_p+1;b_1+1,\dots,b_q+1;z),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{}_pF_q(a_1,\dots,a_p;b_1,\dots,b_q;z).&lt;/math&gt;
Since the space has dimension 2, any three of these ''p''+''q''+2 functions are linearly dependent. These dependencies can be written out to generate a large number of identities involving &lt;math&gt;{}_pF_q&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, in the simplest non-trivial case,
:&lt;math&gt; \; {}_0F_1(;a;z) = (1) \; {}_0F_1(;a;z)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; \; {}_0F_1(;a-1;z) = (\frac{\vartheta}{a-1}+1) \; {}_0F_1(;a;z)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;z \; {}_0F_1(;a+1;z) = (a\vartheta) \; {}_0F_1(;a;z)&lt;/math&gt;,
So 
:&lt;math&gt; \; {}_0F_1(;a-1;z)- \; {}_0F_1(;a;z) = \frac{z}{a(a-1)} \; {}_0F_1(;a+1;z)&lt;/math&gt;.

This, and other important examples,

:&lt;math&gt; \; {}_1F_1(a+1;b;z)- \, {}_1F_1(a;b;z) = \frac{z}{b} \; {}_1F_1(a+1;b+1;z)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; \; {}_1F_1(a;b-1;z)- \, {}_1F_1(a;b;z) = \frac{az}{b(b-1)} \; {}_1F_1(a+1;b+1;z)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; \; {}_1F_1(a;b-1;z)- \, {}_1F_1(a+1;b;z) = \frac{(a-b+1)z}{b(b-1)} \; {}_1F_1(a+1;b+1;z)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \; {}_2F_1(a+1,b;c;z)- \, {}_2F_1(a,b;c;z) = \frac{bz}{c} \; {}_2F_1(a+1,b+1;c+1;z)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; \; {}_2F_1(a+1,b;c;z)- \, {}_2F_1(a,b+1;c;z) = \frac{(b-a)z}{c} \; {}_2F_1(a+1,b+1;c+1;z)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; \; {}_2F_1(a,b;c-1;z)- \, {}_2F_1(a+1,b;c;z) = \frac{(a-c+1)bz}{c(c-1)} \; {}_2F_1(a+1,b+1;c+1;z)&lt;/math&gt;,

can be used to generate [[continued fraction]] expressions known as [[Gauss's continued fraction]].

Similarly, by applying the differentiation formulas twice, there are &lt;math&gt;\binom{p+q+3}{2}&lt;/math&gt; such functions contained in 
:&lt;math&gt;\{1, \vartheta, \vartheta^2\}\; {}_p F_q (a_1,\dots,a_p;b_1,\dots,b_q;z),&lt;/math&gt; 
which has dimension three so any four are linearly dependent. This generates more identities and the process can be continued. The identities thus generated can be combined with each other to produce new ones in a different way.

A function obtained by adding ±1 to exactly one of the parameters ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; in 
:&lt;math&gt;{}_pF_q(a_1,\dots,a_p;b_1,\dots,b_q;z)&lt;/math&gt; 
is called '''contiguous''' to 
:&lt;math&gt;{}_pF_q(a_1,\dots,a_p;b_1,\dots,b_q;z).&lt;/math&gt;
Using the technique outlined above, an identity relating &lt;math&gt;{}_0F_1(;a;z)&lt;/math&gt; and its two contiguous functions can be given, six identities relating &lt;math&gt;{}_1F_1(a;b;z)&lt;/math&gt; and any two of its four contiguous functions, and fifteen identities relating &lt;math&gt;{}_2F_1(a,b;c;z)&lt;/math&gt; and any two of its six contiguous functions have been found. (The first one was derived in the previous paragraph. The last fifteen were given by Gauss in his 1812 paper.)

==Identities==
{{for|identities involving the Gauss hypergeometric function &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|Hypergeometric function}}
A number of other hypergeometric function identities were discovered in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A 20th century contribution to the methodology of proving these identities is the [[Egorychev method]].

===Saalschütz's theorem===
Saalschütz's theorem&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Slater|1966|loc=Section&amp;nbsp;2.3.1}} or {{harv|Bailey|1935|loc=Section&amp;nbsp;2.2}} for a proof.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harv|Saalschütz|1890}} is
:&lt;math&gt;{}_3F_2 (a,b, -n;c, 1+a+b-c-n;1)= \frac{(c-a)_n(c-b)_n}{(c)_n(c-a-b)_n}.&lt;/math&gt;
For extension of this theorem, see a research paper by Rakha &amp; Rathie.

===Dixon's identity===
{{Main|Dixon's identity}}

Dixon's identity,&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Bailey|1935|loc=Section&amp;nbsp;3.1}} for a detailed proof. An alternative proof is in {{harv|Slater|1966|loc=Section&amp;nbsp;2.3.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; first proved by {{harvtxt|Dixon|1902}}, gives the sum of a well-poised &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 1:
:&lt;math&gt;{}_3F_2 (a,b,c;1+a-b,1+a-c;1)= \frac{\Gamma(1+\frac{a}{2})\Gamma(1+\frac{a}{2}-b-c)\Gamma(1+a-b)\Gamma(1+a-c)}{\Gamma(1+a)\Gamma(1+a-b-c)\Gamma(1+\frac{a}{2}-b)\Gamma(1+\frac{a}{2}-c)}.&lt;/math&gt;
For generalization of Dixon's identity, see a paper by Lavoie, et al.

===Dougall's formula===
Dougall's formula {{harvs|authorlink=John Dougall (mathematician)|first=|last=Dougall|year=1907}} gives the sum of a terminating 
[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Well-Poised.html well-poised] series: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{}_7F_6 &amp; \left(\begin{matrix}a&amp;1+\frac{a}{2}&amp;b&amp;c&amp;d&amp;e&amp;-m\\&amp;\frac{a}{2}&amp;1+a-b&amp;1+a-c&amp;1+a-d&amp;1+a-e&amp;1+a+m\\ \end{matrix};1\right) = \\
&amp;=\frac{(1+a)_m(1+a-b-c)_m(1+a-c-d)_m(1+a-b-d)_m}{(1+a-b)_m(1+a-c)_m(1+a-d)_m(1+a-b-c-d)_m}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

provided that ''m'' is a non-negative integer (so that the series terminates) and 
:&lt;math&gt;1+2a=b+c+d+e-m.&lt;/math&gt;
Many of the other formulas for special values of hypergeometric functions can be derived from this as special or limiting cases.

===Generalization of Kummer's transformations and identities for &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===

'''Identity 1.'''
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-x} \; {}_2F_2(a,1+d;c,d;x)= {}_2F_2(c-a-1,f+1;c,f;-x)&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;f=\frac{d(a-c+1)}{a-d}&lt;/math&gt;;

'''Identity 2.'''
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\frac x 2} \, {}_2F_2 \left(a, 1+b; 2a+1, b; x\right)= {}_0F_1 \left(;a+\tfrac{1}{2}; \tfrac {x^2} {16}\right) - \frac{x\left(1-\tfrac{2a} b\right)}{2(2a+1)}\; {}_0F_1 \left(;a+\tfrac 3 2; \tfrac {x^2} {16}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
which links [[Bessel function]]s to &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; this reduces to Kummer's second formula for ''b'' = 2''a'':

'''Identity 3.'''
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\frac x 2} \, {}_1F_1(a,2a,x)= {}_0F_1 \left (;a+\tfrac 1 2; \tfrac{x^2}{16} \right )&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Identity 4.'''
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{}_2F_2(a,b;c,d;x)=&amp; \sum_{i=0} \frac{{b-d \choose i}{a+i-1 \choose i}}{{c+i-1 \choose i}{d+i-1 \choose i}} \; {}_1F_1(a+i;c+i;x)\frac{x^i}{i!} \\
=&amp; e^x \sum_{i=0} \frac{{b-d \choose i}{a+i-1 \choose i}}{{c+i-1 \choose i}{d+i-1 \choose i}} \; {}_1F_1(c-a;c+i;-x)\frac{x^i}{i!},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which is a finite sum if ''b-d'' is a non-negative integer.

===Kummer's relation===

Kummer's relation is
:&lt;math&gt;{}_2F_1\left(2a,2b;a+b+\tfrac 1 2;x\right)= {}_2F_1\left(a,b; a+b+\tfrac 1 2; 4x(1-x)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

===Clausen's formula===
{{Main|Clausen's formula}}
Clausen's formula
:&lt;math&gt;{}_3F_2(2c-2s-1, 2s, c-\tfrac 1 2; 2c-1, c; x)=\, {}_2F_1(c-s-\tfrac 1 2,s; c; x)^2&lt;/math&gt;
was used by [[Louis de Branges de Bourcia|de Branges]] to prove the [[Bieberbach conjecture]].

==Special cases==

Many of the special functions in mathematics are special cases of the [[confluent hypergeometric function]] or the [[hypergeometric function]]; see the corresponding articles for examples.

===The series &lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===
{{Main|Exponential function}}
As noted earlier, &lt;math&gt;{}_0F_0(;;z) = e^z&lt;/math&gt;. The differential equation for this function is &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dz}w = w&lt;/math&gt;, which has solutions &lt;math&gt;w = ke^z&lt;/math&gt; where ''k'' is a constant.

===The series &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===
An important case is: 
:&lt;math&gt;{}_1F_0(a;;z) = (1-z)^{-a}.&lt;/math&gt; 
The differential equation for this function is 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dz}w =\left  (z\frac{d}{dz}+a \right )w,&lt;/math&gt; 
or 
:&lt;math&gt;(1-z)\frac{dw}{dz} = aw,&lt;/math&gt; 
which has solutions 
:&lt;math&gt;w=k(1-z)^{-a}&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''k'' is a constant.

:&lt;math&gt;{}_1F_0(1;;z) = \sum_{n \geqslant 0} z^n = (1-z)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[geometric series]] with ratio ''z'' and coefficient 1.

:&lt;math&gt;z ~ {}_1F_0(2;;z) = \sum_{n \geqslant 0} n z^n = z (1-z)^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; is also useful.

===The series &lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;===
The functions of the form &lt;math&gt;{}_0F_1(;a;z)&lt;/math&gt; are called '''confluent hypergeometric limit functions''' and are closely related to [[Bessel function]]s. The relationship is: 
:&lt;math&gt;J_\alpha(x)=\frac{(\tfrac{x}{2})^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)}  {}_0F_1\left  (;\alpha+1; -\tfrac{1}{4}x^2 \right ).&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;I_\alpha(x)=\frac{(\tfrac{x}{2})^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)}  {}_0F_1\left  (;\alpha+1; \tfrac{1}{4}x^2 \right ).&lt;/math&gt; 
The differential equation for this function is 
:&lt;math&gt;w = \left (z\frac{d}{dz}+a \right )\frac{dw}{dz}&lt;/math&gt; 
or 
:&lt;math&gt;z\frac{d^2w}{dz^2}+a\frac{dw}{dz}-w = 0.&lt;/math&gt; 
When ''a'' is not a positive integer, the substitution 
:&lt;math&gt;w = z^{1-a}u,&lt;/math&gt; 
gives a linearly independent solution 
:&lt;math&gt;z^{1-a}\;{}_0F_1(;2-a;z),&lt;/math&gt; 
so the general solution is 
:&lt;math&gt;k\;{}_0F_1(;a;z)+l z^{1-a}\;{}_0F_1(;2-a;z)&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''k'', ''l'' are constants. (If ''a'' is a positive integer, the independent solution is given by the appropriate Bessel function of the second kind.)

===The series &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;===
{{main|Confluent hypergeometric function}}
The functions of the form &lt;math&gt;{}_1F_1(a;b;z)&lt;/math&gt; are called '''confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind''', also written &lt;math&gt;M(a;b;z)&lt;/math&gt;. The incomplete gamma function &lt;math&gt;\gamma(a,z)&lt;/math&gt; is a special case.

The differential equation for this function is

:&lt;math&gt;\left (z\frac{d}{dz}+a \right )w = \left (z\frac{d}{dz}+b \right )\frac{dw}{dz}&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;z\frac{d^2w}{dz^2}+(b-z)\frac{dw}{dz}-aw = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

When ''b'' is not a positive integer, the substitution

:&lt;math&gt;w = z^{1-b}u,&lt;/math&gt;

gives a linearly independent solution

:&lt;math&gt;z^{1-b}\;{}_1F_1(1+a-b;2-b;z),&lt;/math&gt;

so the general solution is

:&lt;math&gt;k\;{}_1F_1(a;b;z)+l z^{1-b}\;{}_1F_1(1+a-b;2-b;z)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'', ''l'' are constants.

When a is a non-positive integer, −''n'', &lt;math&gt;{}_1F_1(-n;b;z)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial. Up to constant factors, these are the [[Laguerre polynomials]]. This implies [[Hermite polynomials]] can be expressed in terms of &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as well.

===The series &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===
This occurs in connection with the [[exponential integral]] function Ei(''z'').

===The series &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;===
{{main|Hypergeometric function}}
Historically, the most important are the functions of the form &lt;math&gt;{}_2F_1(a,b;c;z)&lt;/math&gt;. These are sometimes called '''Gauss's hypergeometric functions''', classical standard hypergeometric or often simply hypergeometric functions. The term '''Generalized hypergeometric function''' is used for the functions &lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; if there is risk of confusion. This function was first studied in detail by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who explored the conditions for its convergence.

The differential equation for this function is

:&lt;math&gt; \left (z\frac{d}{dz}+a \right ) \left (z\frac{d}{dz}+b \right )w =\left  (z\frac{d}{dz}+c \right )\frac{dw}{dz}&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;z(1-z)\frac{d^2w}{dz^2}+(c-(a+b)z)\frac{dw}{dz}-abw = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

It is known as the [[hypergeometric differential equation]]. When ''c'' is not a positive integer, the substitution

:&lt;math&gt;w = z^{1-c}u&lt;/math&gt;

gives a linearly independent solution

:&lt;math&gt; z^{1-c}\; {}_2F_1(1+a-c,1+b-c;2-c;z),&lt;/math&gt;

so the general solution for |''z''| &lt; 1 is

:&lt;math&gt;k\; {}_2F_1(a,b;c;z)+l z^{1-c}\; {}_2F_1(1+a-c,1+b-c;2-c;z)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'', ''l'' are constants. Different solutions can be derived for other values of ''z''. In fact there are 24 solutions, known as the [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] solutions, derivable using various identities, valid in different regions of the complex plane.

When ''a'' is a non-positive integer, −''n'',
 
:&lt;math&gt;{}_2F_1(-n,b;c;z)&lt;/math&gt;

is a polynomial. Up to constant factors and scaling, these are the [[Jacobi polynomials]]. Several other classes of orthogonal polynomials, up to constant factors, are special cases of Jacobi polynomials, so these can be expressed using &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as well. This includes [[Legendre polynomial]]s and [[Chebyshev polynomial]]s.

A wide range of integrals of elementary functions can be expressed using the hypergeometric function, e.g.:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^x\sqrt{1+y^\alpha}\,\mathrm{d}y=\frac{x}{2+\alpha}\left \{\alpha\;{}_2F_1\left(\tfrac{1}{\alpha},\tfrac{1}{2};1+\tfrac{1}{\alpha};-x^\alpha \right) +2\sqrt{x^\alpha+1} \right \},\qquad \alpha\neq0.&lt;/math&gt;

===The series &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;===
This occurs in connection with [[Mott polynomials]].&lt;ref&gt;See Erdélyi et al. 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The series &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;===
This occurs in the theory of Bessel functions. It provides a way to compute Bessel functions of large arguments.

===Dilogarithm===
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Li}_2(x) = \sum_{n&gt;0}\,{x^n}{n^{-2}} = x \; {}_3F_2(1,1,1;2,2;x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dilogarithm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Candan|first=Cagatay|title=A Simple Proof of F(1,1,1;2,2;x)=dilog(1-x)/x
|url=http://www.eee.metu.edu.tr/~ccandan/pub_dir/hyper_rel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hahn polynomials===
::&lt;math&gt;Q_n(x;a,b,N)= {}_3F_2(-n,-x,n+a+b+1;a+1,-N+1;1)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Hahn polynomial]].

===Wilson polynomials===
::&lt;math&gt;p_n(t^2)=(a+b)_n(a+c)_n(a+d)_n \; {}_4F_3\left( \begin{matrix} -n&amp;a+b+c+d+n-1&amp;a-t&amp;a+t \\ a+b&amp;a+c&amp;a+d \end{matrix} ;1\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Wilson polynomial]].

==Generalizations==
The generalized hypergeometric function is linked to the [[Meijer G-function]] and the [[MacRobert E-function]].  Hypergeometric series were generalised to several variables, for example by [[Paul Emile Appell]] and [[Joseph Kampé de Fériet]]; but a comparable general theory took long to emerge. Many identities were found, some quite remarkable. A generalization, the [[q-series]] analogues, called the [[basic hypergeometric series]], were given by [[Eduard Heine]] in the late nineteenth century. Here, the ratios considered of successive terms, instead of a rational function of ''n'', are a rational function of ''q&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''. Another generalization, the [[elliptic hypergeometric series]], are those series where the ratio of terms is an [[elliptic function]] (a doubly periodic [[meromorphic function]]) of ''n''.

During the twentieth century this was a fruitful area of combinatorial mathematics, with numerous connections to other fields. There are a number of new definitions of [[general hypergeometric function]]s, by Aomoto, [[Israel Gelfand]] and others; and applications for example to the combinatorics of arranging a number of [[hyperplane]]s in complex ''N''-space (see [[arrangement of hyperplanes]]).

Special hypergeometric functions occur as [[zonal spherical function]]s on [[symmetric space|Riemannian symmetric spaces]] and semi-simple [[Lie group]]s. Their importance and role can be understood through the following example: the hypergeometric series &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has the [[Legendre polynomials]] as a special case, and when considered in the form of [[spherical harmonics]], these polynomials reflect, in a certain sense, the symmetry properties of the two-sphere or, equivalently, the rotations given by the Lie group [[SO(3)]].  In tensor product decompositions of concrete representations of this group [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients]] are met, which can be written as &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hypergeometric series.

[[Bilateral hypergeometric series]] are a generalization of hypergeometric functions where one sums over all integers, not just the positive ones.

[[Fox–Wright function]]s are a generalization of generalized hypergeometric functions where the Pochhammer symbols in the series expression are generalised to gamma functions of linear expressions in the index ''n''.

[[Image:Hackenbush_girl.svg|thumb|right|Hackenbush girl, introduced in the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]'']]
'''Hackenbush''' is a two-player game invented by mathematician [[John Horton Conway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://geometer.org/hackenbush/index.html What is Hackenbush?] at geometer.org&lt;/ref&gt; It may be played on any configuration of colored [[line segment]]s connected to one another by their endpoints and to a "ground" line.

==Gameplay==
The game starts with the players drawing a "ground" line (conventionally, but not necessarily, a horizontal line at the bottom of the paper or other playing area) and several line segments such that each line segment is connected to the ground, either directly at an endpoint, or indirectly, via a chain of other segments connected by endpoints.  Any number of segments may meet at a point and thus there may be multiple paths to ground.

On his turn, a player "cuts" (erases) any line segment of his choice. Every line segment no longer connected to the ground by any path "falls" (i.e., gets erased). According to the [[normal play convention]] of combinatorial game theory, the first player who is unable to move loses.

Hackenbush boards can consist of [[finite set|finite]]ly many (in the case of a "finite board") or infinitely many (in the case of an "infinite board") line segments.  The existence of an infinite number of line segments does not violate the [[Combinatorial game theory|game theory]] assumption that the game can be finished in a finite amount of time, provided that there are only finitely many line segments directly "touching" the ground.  On an infinite board, based on the layout of the board the game can continue on forever, assuming there are infinitely many points touching the ground.

===Variants===
In the original folklore version of Hackenbush, any player is allowed to cut any edge: as this is an [[impartial game]] it is comparatively straightforward to give a complete analysis using the [[Sprague–Grundy theorem]]. Thus the versions of Hackenbush of interest in combinatorial game theory are more complex [[partisan game]]s, meaning that the options (moves) available to one player would not necessarily be the ones available to the other player if it were his turn to move given the same position. This is achieved in one of two ways:
* '''''Original Hackenbush:''''' All line segments are the same color and may be cut by either player. This means payoffs are symmetric and each player has the same operations based on position on board (in this case structure of drawing)
*'''''Blue-Red Hackenbush''''':  Each line segment is colored either red or blue.  One player (usually the first, or left, player) is only allowed to cut blue line segments, while the other player (usually the second, or right, player) is only allowed to cut red line segments.
*'''''Blue-Red-Green Hackenbush''''':  Each line segment is colored red, blue, or green.  The rules are the same as for Blue-Red Hackenbush, with the additional stipulation that green line segments can be cut by either player.

Blue-Red Hackenbush is merely a special case of Blue-Red-Green Hackenbush, but it is worth noting separately, as its analysis is often much simpler.  This is because Blue-Red Hackenbush is a so-called ''[[cold game]]'', which means, essentially, that it can never be an advantage to have the first move.

==Analysis==
Hackenbush has often been used as an example game for demonstrating the definitions and concepts in [[combinatorial game theory]], beginning with its use in the books ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]'' by some of the founders of the field.  In particular Blue-Red Hackenbush can be used to construct [[surreal number]]s such as [[nimber]]s:  finite Blue-Red Hackenbush boards can construct [[Dyadic rational|dyadic rational number]]s, while the values of infinite Blue-Red Hackenbush boards account for [[real number]]s, [[ordinal number|ordinal]]s, and many more general values that are neither.  Blue-Red-Green Hackenbush allows for the construction of additional games whose values are not real numbers, such as [[Star (game theory)|star]] and all other [[nimber]]s.

Further analysis of the game can be made using [[graph theory]] by considering the board as a collection of [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] and [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]] and examining the [[Path (graph theory)|paths]] to each vertex that lies on the ground (which should be considered as a distinguished vertex &amp;mdash; it does no harm to identify all the ground points together &amp;mdash; rather than as a line on the graph).

In the impartial version of Hackenbush (the one without player specified colors), it can be thought of using nim heaps by breaking the game up into several cases: vertical, convergent, and divergent. Played exclusively with vertical stacks of line segments, also referred to as bamboo stalks, the game directly becomes [[Nim]] and can be directly analyzed as such. Divergent segments, or trees, add an additional wrinkle to the game and require use of the '''colon principle''' stating that when branches come together at a vertex, one may replace the branches by a non-branching stalk of length equal to their nim sum. This principle changes the representation of the game to the more basic version of the bamboo stalks. The last possible set of graphs that can be made are convergent ones, also known as arbitrarily rooted graphs. By using the fusion principle, we can state that all vertices on any cycle may be fused together without changing the value of the graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45102937|title=Winning ways for your mathematical plays|last=R.|first=Berlekamp, Elwyn|date=2001-2004|publisher=A.K. Peters|others=Conway, John H. (John Horton), Guy, Richard K.|year=|isbn=9781568811420|edition=2nd|location=Natick, Mass.|pages=|oclc=45102937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, any convergent graph can also be interpreted as a simple bamboo stalk graph. By combining all three types of graphs we can add complexity to the game, without ever changing the nim sum of the game, thereby allowing the game to take the strategies of Nim.

==Proof of Colon Principle ==
The Colon Principle states that when branches come together at a vertex, one may replace the branches by a non-branching stalk of length equal to their nim sum. Consider a fixed but arbitrary graph, ''G'', and select an arbitrary vertex, ''x'', in ''G''. Let ''H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' be arbitrary trees (or graphs) that have the same Sprague-Grundy value. Consider the two graphs ''G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the graph constructed by attaching the tree ''H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the vertex ''x'' of the graph ''G''. The colon principle states that the two graphs ''G1'' and ''G2'' have the same Sprague-Grundy value. Consider the sum of the two games as in figure 5.4.  The claim that ''G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' have the same Sprague-Grundy value is equivalent to the claim that the sum of the two games has Sprague-Grundy value 0. In other words, we are to show that the sum ''G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a P-position. A player is guaranteed to win if they are the second player to move in ''G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. If the first player moves by chopping one of the edges in ''G'' in one of the games, then the second player chops the same edge in ''G'' in the other game. (Such a pair of moves may delete ''H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the games, but otherwise ''H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are not disturbed.) If the first player moves by chopping an edge in ''H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', then the Sprague-Grundy values of ''H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are no longer equal, so that there exists a move in ''H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' that keeps the Sprague-Grundy values the same. In this way you will always have a reply to every move he may make. This means you will make the last move and so win.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/comb.pdf|title=Game Theory|last=Ferguson|first=Thomas S.|date=Fall 2000|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], a '''half-transitive graph''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] that is both [[Vertex-transitive graph|vertex-transitive]] and [[Edge-transitive graph|edge-transitive]], but not [[symmetric graph|symmetric]].&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gross, J.L.  |author2=Yellen, J. | title=Handbook of Graph Theory | publisher=CRC Press | year=2004| page=491 | isbn=1-58488-090-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, a graph is half-transitive if its [[automorphism group]] acts [[group action|transitively]] upon both its vertices and its edges, but not on ordered pairs of linked vertices.

[[File:Holt graph.svg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Holt graph]] is the smallest half-transitive graph. The lack of reflectional symmetry in this drawing highlights the fact that edges are not equivalent to their inverse.]]

Every connected [[symmetric graph]] must be [[Vertex-transitive graph|vertex-transitive]] and [[Edge-transitive graph|edge-transitive]], and the converse is true for graphs of odd degree,&lt;ref name="babai"&gt;{{Cite book | first = L | last = Babai | editor-last = Graham | editor-first = R | editor2-last =  Grötschel | editor2-first = M | editor2-link = Martin Grötschel | editor3-last = Lovász | editor3-first = L | title = Handbook of Combinatorics | contribution = Automorphism groups, isomorphism, reconstruction | contribution-url = http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/files/tr_authentic/TR-94-10.ps | year = 1996 | publisher = Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that half-transitive graphs of odd degree do not exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7299">'''James Inman''' (1776-1859), an [[English people|English]] [[mathematician]] and [[astronomer]], was professor of mathematics at the [[Royal Naval College (Portsmouth)|Royal Naval College]], [[Portsmouth]], and author of ''Inman's Nautical Tables''.

==Early years==

Inman was born at Tod Hole in [[Garsdale]], the younger son of Richard Inman and Jane Hutchinson. He was educated at [[Sedbergh Grammar School]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], graduating as first Smith's prizeman and [[Senior Wrangler]] for 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|INMN794J|James Inman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his close college friends was [[Henry Martyn]].

After graduating with first class honours in 1800, Inman intended to undertake missionary work in the [[Middle East]], in [[Syria]], but due to a declaration of war could travel no further than [[Malta]], where he continued to study [[Arabic]].

==Astronomer for Matthew Flinders, 1803-04==

Returning to [[England]], the [[Board of Longitude]] appointed him as replacement astronomer (the original astronomer, suffering from severe seasickness, was discharged en route to Australia) on the expedition of {{HMS|Investigator|1801|6}} under [[Matthew Flinders]] charting [[Australia]]n waters in 1803-1804. Arriving at [[Sydney]] too late to join in Flinders' circumnavigation of Australia, he assisted in concluding the expedition. At this time he became a firm friend of Flinders' nephew, [[John Franklin]], then midshipman. He also befriended the ''Investigator's'' artist, [[William Westall]], for whom he later wrote letters of introduction.  While on board the [[East Indiaman]] ''[[Warley (1796 ship)|Warley]]'' for his return to Britain, he participated in the [[Battle of Pulo Auro]]. Here he temporarily commanded a party of [[lascar]] [[pikemen]].&lt;ref&gt;Harry W. Dickins. 2007. ''Educating the Royal Navy: 18th and 19th Century Education for Officers''. (London: Routledge), p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professor, Royal Naval College==

He was ordained into the Anglican ministry in 1805 when he gained his MA. Three years later he received an appointment as Professor of Nautical Mathematics at the [[Royal Naval College (Portsmouth)|Royal Naval College]]. In 1821 he published ''Navigation and Nautical Astronomy for Seamen''; these nautical [[mathematical tables]], known as Inman's Nautical Tables, remained in use for many years.  In the third edition (1835) he introduced a new table of [[haversine]]s (the term was his coinage&lt;ref name="OED_1989_Haversine"&gt;{{OED|haversine}}. 2nd ed. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inman_1835"&gt;{{cite book | first=James | last=Inman&lt;!-- Rev.

Woodward, C. &amp; J. Rivington | location=London, UK | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Navigation_and_Nautical_Astronomy_for_th.html?id=-fUOnQEACAAJ | access-date=2015-11-09}} (Fourth edition: [https://books.google.com/books?id=MK8PAAAAYAAJ].)&lt;/ref&gt;) to simplify the calculation of distances between two points on the surface of the earth using [[spherical trigonometry]]. (For details of the calculation, see [[Haversine formula]].)

At his suggestion, in 1810 the [[Admiralty]] established a [[School of Naval Architecture]]; the Admiralty also appointed Inman its first Principal. In 1812 he conducted experiments with Flinders which led to the invention of the [[Flinders Bar]], used for marine compass correction.  At the same time as teaching in the school and publishing mathematical texts for the use of his pupils, he translated a French text on the architecture of shipbuilding, and continued his own studies, gaining his doctorate in Divinity in 1820. In recognition of his work in nautical astronomy he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]].

He also directed the design and construction of no less than ten British warships, of which he was proud to state that none ever had the slightest mishap due to an error of design or form.

He retired in 1839, but continued living in Portsmouth until his death twenty years later, on 7 February 1859, aged 83.

==Family and Legacy==

His wife Mary, daughter of Richard Williams, vicar of [[All Saints' Church, Oakham]], [[Rutland]], was a direct descendant of Hannah Ayscough, the mother of [[Sir Isaac Newton]].  James and Mary Inman had seven children.  Their eldest son was James Williams Inman (1809-1895), Cambridge BA 1833, MA 1836, headmaster of [[The King's School, Grantham]].  Their youngest son [[Henry Inman (Police Commander)|Henry Inman]] (1816-1895), was founder and first commander of the [[South Australia Police]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Slee [http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/36918700?q&amp;versionId=47932463 ''Inman : first commander of the South Australia Police''], Seaview Press (Adelaide 2010) {{ISBN|978-1-74008-559-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Franklin's first North American expedition he named [[Inman Harbour]] 'after my friend the Professor at the Royal Naval College'.  During Franklin's second arctic voyage in 1826 his surveyor named the Inman River, northwest of [[Coppermine River]], [[Canada]], after Inman. In December 1829 a headland of perpendicular cliffs at [[Tierra del Fuego]] was named [[Cape Inman]], 'in compliment to the Professor', during the voyages of [[HMS Adventure]] and [[HMS Beagle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27968">In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], '''kurtosis''' (from {{lang-el|κυρτός}}, ''kyrtos'' or ''kurtos'', meaning "curved, arching") is a measure of the "tailedness" of the [[probability distribution]] of a [[real number|real]]-valued [[random variable]]. In a similar way to the concept of [[skewness]], kurtosis is a descriptor of the shape of a probability distribution and, just as for skewness, there are different ways of quantifying it for a theoretical distribution and corresponding ways of estimating it from a sample from a population. Depending on the particular measure of kurtosis that is used, there are various [[#Interpretation|interpretations]] of kurtosis, and of how particular measures should be interpreted.

The standard measure of kurtosis, originating with [[Karl Pearson]], is based on a scaled version of the fourth [[moment (statistics)|moment]] of the data or population. This number is related to the tails of the distribution, not its peak;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 4321753 | pmid=25678714 | doi=10.1080/00031305.2014.917055 | volume=68 | issue=3 | title=Kurtosis as Peakedness, 1905 - 2014. ''R.I.P.'' | journal=Am Stat | pages=191–195 | last1 = Westfall | first1 = PH| year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; hence, the sometimes-seen characterization as "peakedness" is mistaken. For this measure, higher kurtosis is the result of infrequent extreme [[Deviation (statistics)|deviations]] (or outliers), as opposed to frequent modestly sized deviations.

The kurtosis of any univariate [[normal distribution]] is&amp;nbsp;3.  It is common to compare the kurtosis of a distribution to this value.  Distributions with kurtosis less than&amp;nbsp;3 are said to be ''platykurtic'', although this does not imply the distribution is "flat-topped" as sometimes reported. Rather, it means the distribution produces fewer and less extreme outliers than does the normal distribution. An example of a platykurtic distribution is the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]], which does not produce outliers.  Distributions with kurtosis greater than 3 are said to be ''leptokurtic''.  An example of a leptokurtic distribution is the [[Laplace distribution]], which has tails that asymptotically approach zero more slowly than a Gaussian, and therefore produces more outliers than the normal distribution. It is also common practice to use an adjusted version of Pearson's kurtosis, the excess kurtosis, which is the kurtosis minus 3, to provide the comparison to the [[normal distribution]].  Some authors use "kurtosis" by itself to refer to the excess kurtosis.  For the reason of clarity and generality, however, this article follows the non-excess convention and explicitly indicates where excess kurtosis is meant.

Alternative measures of kurtosis are: the [[L-kurtosis]], which is a scaled version of the fourth [[L-moment]]; measures based on four population or sample [[quantiles]].&lt;ref name=JG&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joanes&lt;!--sic--&gt; |first=D. N. |last2=Gill |first2=C. A. |year=1998 |title=Comparing measures of sample skewness and kurtosis |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series D]] |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=183–189 |doi=10.1111/1467-9884.00122}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are analogous to the alternative measures of [[skewness]] that are not based on ordinary moments.&lt;ref name=JG/&gt;

== Pearson moments ==
The kurtosis is the fourth [[standardized moment]], defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Kurt}[X] = \operatorname{E}\left[\left(\frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^4\right] = \frac{\mu_4}{\sigma^4} = \frac{\operatorname{E}[(X-\mu)^4]}{(\operatorname{E}[(X-\mu)^2])^2},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the fourth [[central moment]] and σ is the [[standard deviation]].
Several letters are used in the literature to denote the kurtosis.  A very common choice is ''κ'', which is fine as long as it is clear that it does not refer to a [[cumulant]].  Other choices include ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to be similar to the notation for skewness, although sometimes this is instead reserved for the excess kurtosis.

The kurtosis is bounded below by the squared [[skewness]] plus 1:
&lt;ref name="Pearson1929"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearson |first=K. |year=1929 |title=Editorial note to 'Inequalities for moments of frequency functions and for various statistical constants' |journal=[[Biometrika]] | volume = 21 | issue =1–4| pages = 361–375 | doi = 10.1093/biomet/21.1-4.361 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mu_4}{\sigma^4} \geq \left(\frac{\mu_3}{\sigma^3}\right)^2 + 1,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the third [[central moment]].
The lower bound is realized by the [[Bernoulli distribution]].
There is no upper limit to the excess kurtosis of a general probability distribution, and it may be infinite.

A reason why some authors favor the excess kurtosis is that cumulants are [[intensive and extensive properties|extensive]].  Formulas related to the extensive property are more naturally expressed in terms of the excess kurtosis.  For example, let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be independent random variables for which the fourth moment exists, and let ''Y'' be the random variable defined by the sum of the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The excess kurtosis of ''Y'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Kurt}[Y] - 3 =  \frac{1}{( \sum_{j=1}^n \sigma_j^{\,2})^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^{\,4} \cdot \left(\operatorname{Kurt}[X_i] - 3\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the standard deviation of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular if all of the ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; have the same variance, then this simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Kurt}[Y] - 3 = {1 \over n^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (\operatorname{Kurt}[X_i] - 3).&lt;/math&gt;

The reason not to subtract off 3 is that the bare [[fourth moment]] better generalizes to [[multivariate distribution]]s, especially when independence is not assumed.  The [[cokurtosis]] between pairs of variables is an order four [[tensor]].  For a bivariate normal distribution, the cokurtosis tensor has off-diagonal terms that are neither 0 nor 3 in general, so attempting to "correct" for an excess becomes confusing.  It is true, however, that the joint cumulants of degree greater than two for any [[multivariate normal distribution]] are zero.

For two random variables, ''X'' and ''Y'', not necessarily independent, the kurtosis of the sum, ''X''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''Y'', is
:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{Kurt}[X+Y] = {1 \over \sigma_{X+Y}^4} \big( &amp; \sigma_X^4\operatorname{Kurt}[X] + 4\sigma_X^3\sigma_Y\operatorname{Cokurt}[X,X,X,Y] \\
&amp; {} + 6\sigma_X^2\sigma_Y^2\operatorname{Cokurt}[X,X,Y,Y] \\[6pt]
&amp; {} + 4\sigma_X\sigma_Y^3\operatorname{Cokurt}[X,Y,Y,Y] + \sigma_Y^4\operatorname{Kurt}[Y] \big).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the [[binomial coefficient]]s appear in the above equation.

=== Interpretation ===
The exact interpretation of the Pearson measure of kurtosis (or excess kurtosis) used to be disputed, but is now settled. As Westfall (2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Westfall|first1=PH|title=Kurtosis as Peakedness, 1905 - 2014. ''R.I.P.''|journal=The American Statistician|date=2014|volume=68|issue=3|pages=191–195|doi=10.1080/00031305.2014.917055|pmid=25678714|pmc=4321753}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes, "...its only unambiguous interpretation is in terms of tail extremity; i.e., either existing outliers (for the sample kurtosis) or propensity to produce outliers (for the kurtosis of a probability distribution)." The logic is simple: Kurtosis is the average (or [[expected value]]) of the [[standardized data]] raised to the fourth power. Any standardized values that are less than 1 (i.e., data within one standard deviation of the mean, where the "peak" would be), contribute virtually nothing to kurtosis, since raising a number that is less than 1 to the fourth power makes it closer to zero. The only data values (observed or observable) that contribute to kurtosis in any meaningful way are those outside the region of the peak; i.e., the outliers. Therefore, kurtosis measures outliers only; it measures nothing about the "peak."

Many incorrect interpretations of kurtosis that involve notions of peakedness have been given. One is that kurtosis measures both the "peakedness" of the distribution and the [[heavy-tailed distribution|heaviness of its tail]].&lt;ref name="balanda"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balanda | first1 = Kevin P. | last2 = MacGillivray | first2 = H.L. | year = 1988 | title = Kurtosis: A Critical Review | url = | journal = The American Statistician | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 111–119 | doi=10.2307/2684482| jstor = 2684482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other incorrect interpretations have been suggested, such as "lack of shoulders" (where the "shoulder" is defined vaguely as the area between the peak and the tail, or more specifically as the area about one [[standard deviation]] from the mean) or "bimodality".&lt;ref name="darlington"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Darlington | first1 = Richard B | year = 1970 | title = Is Kurtosis Really 'Peakedness'? | url = | journal = The American Statistician | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 19–22 | doi=10.1080/00031305.1970.10478885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balanda and MacGillivray assert that the standard definition of kurtosis "is a poor measure of the kurtosis, peakedness, or tail weight of a distribution"&lt;ref&gt;Balanda and MacGillivray, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; and instead propose to "define kurtosis vaguely as the location- and scale-free movement of [[probability mass]] from the [[shoulders of a distribution]] into its center and tails".&lt;ref name="balanda"/&gt;

===Moors' interpretation===

In 1986 Moors gave an interpretation of kurtosis.&lt;ref name=Moors1986&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moors | first1 = JJA | year = 1986b | title = The meaning of kurtosis: Darlington reexamined | url = | journal = The American Statistician | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 283–284 | doi=10.1080/00031305.1986.10475415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let
  
:&lt;math&gt; Z = \frac{ X - \mu } \sigma, &lt;/math&gt; 
 
where ''X'' is a random variable, ''μ'' is the mean and ''σ'' is the standard deviation. Then
 
:&lt;math&gt; \kappa = E( Z^4 ) = \operatorname{var}( Z^2 ) + [ E( Z^2 ) ]^2 = \operatorname{var}( Z^2 ) + 1, &lt;/math&gt;
 
where ''κ'' is the kurtosis, ''var''() is the variance and ''E''() is the [[expectation operator]]. The kurtosis can now be seen to be a measure of the dispersion of ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; around its expectation. Alternatively it can be seen to be a measure of the dispersion of ''Z'' around +1 and&amp;nbsp;−1. ''κ'' attains its minimal value in a symmetric two-point distribution. In terms of the original variable ''X'', the kurtosis is a measure of the dispersion of ''X'' around the two values ''μ''&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;''σ''.

High values of ''κ'' arise in two circumstances:
 
* where the probability mass is concentrated around the mean and the data-generating process produces occasional values far from the mean, 
* where the probability mass is concentrated in the tails of the distribution.

== Excess kurtosis ==

The ''excess kurtosis'' is defined as kurtosis minus&amp;nbsp;3. There are 3 distinct regimes as described below.

=== Mesokurtic ===

Distributions with zero excess kurtosis are called '''mesokurtic''', or mesokurtotic. The most prominent example of a mesokurtic distribution is the normal distribution family, regardless of the values of its [[parameter]]s. A few other well-known distributions can be mesokurtic, depending on parameter values: for example, the [[binomial distribution]] is mesokurtic for &lt;math&gt;p = 1/2 \pm \sqrt{1/12}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Leptokurtic ===
A distribution with [[Positive number|positive]] excess kurtosis is called '''leptokurtic''', or leptokurtotic. "Lepto-" means "slender".&lt;ref&gt;http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/lepto-&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of shape, a leptokurtic distribution has ''[[Fat-tailed distribution|fatter tails]]''. Examples of leptokurtic distributions include the [[Student's t-distribution]], [[Rayleigh distribution]],  [[Laplace distribution]], [[exponential distribution]], [[Poisson distribution]] and the [[logistic distribution]].  Such distributions are sometimes termed ''super-Gaussian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benveniste|first=A.|last2=Goursat|first2=M.|last3=Ruget|first3=G.|date=1980-06|title=Robust identification of a nonminimum phase system: Blind adjustment of a linear equalizer in data communications|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tac.1980.1102343|journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control|volume=25|issue=3|pages=385–399|doi=10.1109/tac.1980.1102343|issn=0018-9286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Platykurtic ===
[[File:1909 US Penny.jpg|thumb|The [[coin toss]] is the most platykurtic distribution]]
A distribution with [[Negative number|negative]] excess kurtosis is called '''platykurtic''', or platykurtotic. "Platy-" means "broad".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourdictionary.com/platy-prefix&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of shape, a platykurtic distribution has ''thinner tails''. Examples of platykurtic distributions include the [[Continuous uniform distribution|continuous]] and [[discrete uniform distribution]]s, and the [[raised cosine distribution]]. The most platykurtic distribution of all is the [[Bernoulli distribution]] with ''p'' = 1/2 (for example the number of times one obtains "heads" when flipping a coin once, a [[coin toss]]), for which the excess kurtosis is −2. Such distributions are sometimes termed ''sub-Gaussian''.&lt;ref&gt;The original paper presenting sub-Gaussians {{cite journal |authorlink=Jean-Pierre Kahane |first=J.

=== The Pearson type VII family ===
[[Image:Pearson type VII distribution PDF.png|300px|thumb|[[Probability density function|pdf]] for the Pearson type VII distribution with excess kurtosis of infinity (red); 2 (blue); and 0 (black)]]
[[Image:Pearson type VII distribution log-PDF.png|300px|thumb|log-pdf for the Pearson type VII distribution with excess kurtosis of infinity (red); 2 (blue); 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 (gray); and 0 (black)]]

The effects of kurtosis are illustrated using a [[parametric family]] of distributions whose kurtosis can be adjusted while their lower-order moments and cumulants remain constant. Consider the [[Pearson distribution|Pearson type VII family]], which is a special case of the [[Pearson distribution|Pearson type IV family]] restricted to symmetric densities. The [[probability density function]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;f(x; a, m) = \frac{\Gamma(m)}{a\,\sqrt{\pi}\,\Gamma(m-1/2)} \left[1+\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2 \right]^{-m}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is a [[scale parameter]] and ''m'' is a [[shape parameter]].

All densities in this family are symmetric. The ''k''th moment exists provided ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;(''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/2. For the kurtosis to exist, we require ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;5/2. Then the mean and [[skewness]] exist and are both identically zero. Setting ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''m''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3 makes the variance equal to unity. Then the only free parameter is ''m'', which controls the fourth moment (and cumulant) and hence the kurtosis.  One can reparameterize with &lt;math&gt;m = 5/2 + 3/\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; is the excess kurtosis as defined above. This yields a one-parameter leptokurtic family with zero mean, unit variance, zero skewness, and arbitrary non-negative excess kurtosis. The reparameterized density is

:&lt;math&gt;g(x; \gamma_2) = f\left(x;\; a = \sqrt{2 + \frac{6}{\gamma_2}},\; m = \frac{5}{2} + \frac{3}{\gamma_2}\right). \!&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit as &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2 \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; one obtains the density

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = 3\left(2 + x^2\right)^{-\frac{5}{2}}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

which is shown as the red curve in the images on the right.

In the other direction as &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2 \to 0&lt;/math&gt; one obtains the [[normal distribution|standard normal]] density as the limiting distribution, shown as the black curve.

In the images on the right, the blue curve represents the density &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto g(x; 2)&lt;/math&gt; with excess kurtosis of 2.  The top image shows that leptokurtic densities in this family have a higher peak than the mesokurtic normal density, although this conclusion is only valid for this select family of distributions. The comparatively fatter tails of the leptokurtic densities are illustrated in the second image, which plots the natural logarithm of the Pearson type VII densities: the black curve is the logarithm of the standard normal density, which is a [[parabola]]. One can see that the normal density allocates little probability mass to the regions far from the mean ("has thin tails"), compared with the blue curve of the leptokurtic Pearson type VII density with excess kurtosis of 2.  Between the blue curve and the black are other Pearson type VII densities with ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16.  The red curve again shows the upper limit of the Pearson type VII family, with &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2 = \infty&lt;/math&gt; (which, strictly speaking, means that the fourth moment does not exist). The red curve decreases the slowest as one moves outward from the origin ("has fat tails").

== Of well-known distributions ==
[[Image:Standard symmetric pdfs.png|300px|thumb|[[Probability density function]]s for selected distributions with [[expected value|mean]] 0, [[variance]] 1 and different excess kurtosis]]
[[Image:Standard symmetric pdfs logscale.png|300px|thumb|[[Logarithm]]s of [[probability density function]]s for selected distributions with [[expected value|mean]] 0, [[variance]] 1 and different excess kurtosis]]

Several well-known, unimodal and symmetric distributions from different parametric families are compared here.  Each has a mean and skewness of zero. The parameters have been chosen to result in a variance equal to 1 in each case. The images on the right show curves for the following seven densities, on a [[linear scale]] and [[logarithmic scale]]:

* D: [[Laplace distribution]], also known as the double exponential distribution, red curve (two straight lines in the log-scale plot), excess kurtosis = 3
* S: [[hyperbolic secant distribution]], orange curve, excess kurtosis = 2
* L: [[logistic distribution]], green curve, excess kurtosis = 1.2
* N: [[normal distribution]], black curve (inverted parabola in the log-scale plot), excess kurtosis = 0
* C: [[raised cosine distribution]], cyan curve, excess kurtosis = −0.593762...
* W: [[Wigner semicircle distribution]], blue curve, excess kurtosis = −1
* U: [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]], magenta curve (shown for clarity as a rectangle in both images), excess kurtosis = −1.2.

Note that in these cases the platykurtic densities have bounded [[Support (mathematics)|support]], whereas the densities with positive or zero excess kurtosis are supported on the whole [[real line]].

There exist platykurtic densities with infinite support,
*e.g., [[exponential power distribution]]s with sufficiently large shape parameter ''b''

and there exist leptokurtic densities with finite support.
*e.g., a distribution that is uniform between −3 and −0.3, between −0.3 and 0.3, and between 0.3 and 3, with the same density in the (−3, −0.3) and (0.3, 3) intervals, but with 20 times more density in the (−0.3, 0.3) interval

== Sample kurtosis ==
For a [[sample (statistics)|sample]] of ''n'' values the '''sample excess kurtosis''' is

:&lt;math&gt; g_2 = \frac{m_4}{m_2^2} -3 = \frac{\tfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^4}{\left(\tfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^2\right)^2} - 3 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the fourth sample [[moment about the mean]], ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the second sample moment about the mean (that is, the [[sample variance]]), ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; value, and &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[sample mean]].

This formula has the simpler representation,

:&lt;math&gt; g_2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n z_i^4  - 3 &lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt; z_i &lt;/math&gt; values are the standardized data values using the standard deviation defined using ''n'' rather than ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 in the denominator.

For example, suppose the data values are 0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 999.

Then the  &lt;math&gt; z_i &lt;/math&gt; values are −0.239, −0.225, −0.221, −0.234, −0.230, −0.225, −0.239, −0.230, −0.234, −0.225, −0.230, −0.239, −0.230, −0.230, −0.225, −0.230, −0.216, −0.230, −0.225, 4.359

and the &lt;math&gt; z_i^4 &lt;/math&gt; values are  0.003, 0.003, 0.002, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.002, 0.003, 0.003, 360.976.

The average of these values is 18.05 and the excess kurtosis is thus 18.05&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;15.05.  This example makes it clear that data near the "middle" or "peak" of the distribution do not contribute to the kurtosis statistic, hence kurtosis does not measure "peakedness." It is simply a measure of the outlier, 999 in this example.

== Sampling variance under normality ==

The variance of the sample kurtosis of a sample of size ''n'' from the [[normal distribution]] is&lt;ref name=Duncan1997&gt;{{cite book |first=Duncan |last=Cramer |year=1997 |title=Fundamental Statistics for Social Research |location= |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-17204-2 |page=89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{24n(n-1)^2}{(n-3)(n-2)(n+3)(n+5)} &lt;/math&gt;

Stated differently, under the assumption that the underlying random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is normally distributed, it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n} g_2 \xrightarrow{d} N(0, 24)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, M.G.; Stuart, A. (1969) ''The Advanced Theory of Statistics, Volume 1: Distribution Theory, 3rd Edition'', Griffin. {{isbn|0-85264-141-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Upper bound ==

An upper bound for the sample kurtosis of ''n'' (''n'' &gt; 2) real numbers is&lt;ref name="Sharma and Bhandari 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sharma |first1=R. |last2= Bhandari |first2=R. |date=11 Sep 2013 |title=Skewness, kurtosis and Newton's inequality |journal=Rocky Mountain Journal of Mathematics |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=1639–1643 |arxiv=1309.2896|bibcode=2013arXiv1309.2896S |doi=10.1216/RMJ-2015-45-5-1639 |mr=3452232|zbl=1355.60028|year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimators of population kurtosis ==
Given a sub-set of samples from a population, the sample excess kurtosis above is a [[biased estimator]] of the population excess kurtosis. An alternative estimator of the population excess kurtosis is defined as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the unique symmetric [[bias of an estimator|unbiased]] estimator of the fourth [[cumulant]], ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the unbiased estimate of the second cumulant (identical to the unbiased estimate of the sample variance), ''m''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the fourth sample moment about the mean, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the second sample moment about the mean, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; value, and &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the sample mean. Unfortunately, &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; is itself generally biased. For the [[normal distribution]] it is unbiased.&lt;ref name=JG/&gt;

== Applications ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

The sample kurtosis is a useful measure of whether there is a problem with outliers in a data set. Larger kurtosis indicates a more serious outlier problem, and may lead the researcher to choose alternative statistical methods.

[[D'Agostino's K-squared test]] is a [[goodness-of-fit]] [[normality test]] based on a combination of the sample skewness and sample kurtosis, as is the [[Jarque–Bera test]] for normality.

For non-normal samples, the variance of the sample variance depends on the kurtosis; for details, please see [[Variance#Distribution of the sample variance|variance]].

Pearson's definition of kurtosis is used as an indicator of intermittency in [[turbulence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sandborn |first=V. A. |title=Measurements of Intermittency of Turbulent Motion in a Boundary Layer |journal=[[Journal of Fluid Mechanics]] |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=221–240 |year=1959 |doi=10.1017/S0022112059000581 |bibcode=1959JFM.....6..221S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kurtosis convergence===
Applying [[band-pass filter]]s to [[digital image]]s, kurtosis values tend to be uniform, independent of the range of the filter. This behavior, termed ''kurtosis convergence'', can be used to detect image splicing in [[forensic analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.albany.edu/~lsw/homepage/PUBLICATIONS_files/ICCP.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other measures ==
A different measure of "kurtosis" is provided by using [[L-moment]]s instead of the ordinary moments.&lt;ref name=hos:92&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hosking | first= J.R.M. | year=1992 | title=Moments or L moments?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9364">In contexts including [[complex manifold]]s and [[algebraic geometry]], a '''logarithmic''' [[differential form]] is a meromorphic differential form with [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of a certain kind. The concept was introduced by [[Pierre Deligne|Deligne]].&lt;ref&gt;Deligne, Pierre.  ''Equations différentielles à points singuliers réguliers''. Lecture Notes in Mathematics. 163. Berlin-Heidelberg-New York: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''X'' be a complex manifold, ''D'' ⊂ ''X'' a [[Divisor_(algebraic_geometry)|divisor]], and ω a holomorphic ''p''-form on ''X''−''D''. If ω and ''d''ω have a pole of order at most one along ''D'', then ω is said to have a logarithmic pole along ''D''. ω is also known as a logarithmic ''p''-form. The logarithmic ''p''-forms make up a [[Sheaf (mathematics)|subsheaf]] of the meromorphic ''p''-forms on ''X'' with a pole along ''D'', denoted

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega^p_X(\log D).&lt;/math&gt;

In the theory of [[Riemann surfaces]], one encounters logarithmic one-forms which have the local expression

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{df}{f} =\left(\frac{m}{z} + \frac{g'(z)}{g(z)}\right)dz&lt;/math&gt;

for some [[meromorphic function]] (resp. [[rational function]]) &lt;math&gt; f(z) = z^mg(z) &lt;/math&gt;, where ''g'' is holomorphic and non-vanishing at 0,  and ''m'' is the order of ''f'' at ''0''. That is, for some [[open covering]], there are local representations of this differential form as a [[logarithmic derivative]] (modified slightly with the [[exterior derivative]] ''d'' in place of the usual [[differential operator]] ''d/dz''). Observe that ω has only simple poles with integer residues. On higher-dimensional complex manifolds, the [[Poincaré residue]] is used to describe the distinctive behavior of logarithmic forms along poles.

==Holomorphic log complex==
By definition of &lt;math&gt;\Omega^p_X(\log D)&lt;/math&gt; and the fact that exterior differentiation ''d'' satisfies ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0, one has
:&lt;math&gt; d\Omega^p_X(\log D)(U)\subset \Omega^{p+1}_X(\log D)(U) &lt;/math&gt;. 
This implies that there is a complex of sheaves &lt;math&gt;( \Omega^{\bullet}_X(\log D), d) &lt;/math&gt;, known as the ''holomorphic log complex'' corresponding to the divisor ''D''. This is a subcomplex  of &lt;math&gt; j_*\Omega^{\bullet}_{X-D} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; j:X-D\rightarrow X &lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion and &lt;math&gt; \Omega^{\bullet}_{X-D} &lt;/math&gt; is the complex of sheaves of holomorphic forms on ''X''−''D''.

Of special interest is the case where ''D'' has simple [[normal crossings]]. Then if &lt;math&gt; \{D_{\nu}\} &lt;/math&gt; are the smooth, irreducible components of ''D'', one has &lt;math&gt; D = \sum D_{\nu} &lt;/math&gt; with the &lt;math&gt; D_{\nu} &lt;/math&gt; meeting transversely. Locally ''D'' is the union of hyperplanes, with local defining equations of the form &lt;math&gt; z_1\cdots z_k = 0 &lt;/math&gt; in some holomorphic coordinates. One can show that the stalk of &lt;math&gt; \Omega^1_X(\log D) &lt;/math&gt; at ''p'' satisfies&lt;ref name="foo"&gt;Chris A.M. Peters; Joseph H.M. Steenbrink (2007). Mixed Hodge Structures. Springer. {{ISBN|978-3-540-77017-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_X^1(\log D)_p = \mathcal{O}_{X,p}\frac{dz_1}{z_1}\oplus\cdots\oplus\mathcal{O}_{X,p}\frac{dz_k}{z_k} \oplus \mathcal{O}_{X,p}dz_{k+1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathcal{O}_{X,p}dz_n&lt;/math&gt;
and that
:&lt;math&gt; \Omega_X^k(\log D)_p = \bigwedge^k_{j=1} \Omega_X^1(\log D)_p &lt;/math&gt;.
Some authors, e.g.,&lt;ref name = "foo2"&gt;Phillip A. Griffiths; Joseph Harris (1979). Principles of Algebraic Geometry. Wiley-Interscience. {{ISBN|0-471-05059-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; use the term ''log complex'' to refer to the holomorphic log complex corresponding to a divisor with normal crossings.

===Higher-dimensional example===
Consider a once-punctured elliptic curve, given as the locus ''D'' of complex points (''x'',''y'') satisfying &lt;math&gt;g(x,y) = y^2 - f(x) = 0,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x(x-1)(x-\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda\neq 0,1&lt;/math&gt; is a complex number. Then ''D'' is a smooth irreducible [[hypersurface]] in '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and, in particular, a divisor with simple normal crossings. There is a meromorphic two-form on '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; \omega =\frac{dx\wedge dy}{g(x,y)} &lt;/math&gt;

which has a simple pole along ''D''. The Poincaré residue &lt;ref name = "foo2"/&gt; of ω along ''D'' is given by the holomorphic one-form

:&lt;math&gt; \text{Res}_D(\omega) = \left. \frac{dy}{\partial g/\partial x} \right |_D =\left. -\frac{dx}{\partial g/\partial y} \right |_D = \left. -\frac{1}{2}\frac{dx}{y} \right |_D. &lt;/math&gt;

Vital to the residue theory of logarithmic forms is the [[Gysin sequence]], which is in some sense a generalization of the [[Residue Theorem]] for compact Riemann surfaces. This can be used to show, for example, that &lt;math&gt;dx/y|_D &lt;/math&gt; extends to a holomorphic one-form on the [[Projective space#Projective space and affine space|projective closure]] of ''D'' in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a smooth elliptic curve.

=== Hodge theory ===
The holomorphic log complex can be brought to bear on the [[Hodge theory]] of complex algebraic varieties. Let ''X'' be a complex algebraic manifold and &lt;math&gt; j: X\hookrightarrow Y &lt;/math&gt; a good compactification. This means that ''Y'' is a compact algebraic manifold and ''D'' = ''Y''−''X'' is a divisor on ''Y'' with simple normal crossings. The natural inclusion of complexes of sheaves
:&lt;math&gt; \Omega^{\bullet}_Y(\log D)\rightarrow j_*\Omega_{X}^{\bullet} &lt;/math&gt;
turns out to be a quasi-isomorphism.  Thus
:&lt;math&gt; H^k(X;\mathbf{C}) = \mathbb{H}^k(Y, \Omega^{\bullet}_Y(\log D))&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}^{\bullet}&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[hypercohomology]] of a complex of abelian sheaves. There is&lt;ref name="foo"/&gt; a decreasing filtration &lt;math&gt;W_{\bullet} \Omega^p_Y(\log D) &lt;/math&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt;W_{m}\Omega^p_Y(\log D) =  \begin{cases}
0 &amp; m &lt; 0\\
\Omega^p_Y(\log D) &amp; m\geq p \\
\Omega^{p-m}_Y\wedge \Omega^m_Y(\log D) &amp; 0\leq m \leq p
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;
which, along with the trivial  increasing filtration &lt;math&gt;F^{\bullet}\Omega^p_Y(\log D) &lt;/math&gt; on logarithmic ''p''-forms, produces filtrations on cohomology
:&lt;math&gt; W_mH^k(X; \mathbf{C}) = \text{Im}(\mathbb{H}^k(Y, W_{m-k}\Omega^{\bullet}_Y(\log D))\rightarrow H^k(X; \mathbf{C})) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; F^pH^k(X; \mathbf{C}) = \text{Im}(\mathbb{H}^k(Y, F^p\Omega^{\bullet}_Y(\log D))\rightarrow H^k(X; \mathbf{C})) &lt;/math&gt;.
One shows&lt;ref name="foo"/&gt; that &lt;math&gt; W_mH^k(X; \mathbf{C}) &lt;/math&gt; can actually be defined over '''Q'''. Then the filtrations &lt;math&gt; W_{\bullet}, F^{\bullet}&lt;/math&gt; on cohomology give rise to a mixed Hodge structure on &lt;math&gt; H^k(X; \mathbf{Z}) &lt;/math&gt;.

Classically, for example in [[elliptic function]] theory, the logarithmic differential forms were recognised as complementary to the [[differentials of the first kind]]. They were sometimes called ''differentials of the second kind'' (and, with an unfortunate inconsistency, also sometimes ''of the third kind''). The classical theory has now been subsumed as an aspect of Hodge theory. For a Riemann surface ''S'', for example, the differentials of the first kind account for the term ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; in ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''S''), when by the [[Dolbeault isomorphism]] it is interpreted as the [[sheaf cohomology]] group ''H''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''S'',Ω); this is tautologous considering their definition. The ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; direct summand in ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''S''), as well as being interpreted as ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''S'',O) where O is the sheaf of [[holomorphic function]]s on ''S'', can be identified more concretely with a vector space of logarithmic differentials.

== Algebraic Geometry ==
In [[algebraic geometry]], the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of '''logarithmic differential ''p''-forms''' &lt;math&gt;\Omega^p_X(\log D)&lt;/math&gt; on a [[Smooth scheme|smooth]] [[projective variety]] ''X'' along a smooth [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]] &lt;math&gt;D = \sum D_j&lt;/math&gt; is defined and fits into the [[exact sequence]] of locally free sheaves:

: &lt;math&gt;0 \to \Omega^p_X \to \Omega^p_X(\log D) \overset{\beta}\to \oplus_j {i_j}_*\Omega^{p-1}_{D_j} \to 0, \, p \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i_j: D_j \to X&lt;/math&gt; are the inclusions of irreducible divisors (and the pushforwards along them are extension by zero), and β is called the [[residue map]] when ''p'' is 1.

For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deligne|loc=Part II, Lemma 3.2.1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; if ''x'' is a closed point on &lt;math&gt;D_j, 1 \le j \le k&lt;/math&gt; and not on &lt;math&gt;D_j, j &gt; k&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;{du_1 \over u_1}, \dots, {du_k \over u_k}, \, du_k, \dots, du_n&lt;/math&gt;
form a basis of &lt;math&gt;\Omega^1_X(\log D)&lt;/math&gt; at ''x'', where &lt;math&gt;u_j&lt;/math&gt; are local coordinates around ''x'' such that &lt;math&gt;u_j, 1 \le j \le k&lt;/math&gt; are local parameters for &lt;math&gt;D_j, 1 \le j \le k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!--(Roughly, if &lt;math&gt;f = g \prod_1^k u^{a_j}&lt;/math&gt; is a section around ''x'', then &lt;math&gt;d(\log(f)) = {dg \over g} + \sum_1^k a_i {du_j \over u_j}&lt;/math&gt; and use this to get the claim.)--&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''loop algebras''' are certain types of [[Lie algebra]]s, of particular interest in [[theoretical physics]].

==Definition==
If {{math|'''g'''}} is a Lie algebra, the [[tensor product]] of {{math|'''g'''}} with {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, the [[associative algebra|algebra]] of (complex) [[smooth function]]s over the [[n-sphere|circle]] [[manifold]] {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}},

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}\otimes C^\infty(S^1)&lt;/math&gt;,

is an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra with the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;[g_1\otimes f_1,g_2 \otimes f_2]=[g_1,g_2]\otimes f_1 f_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Here {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are elements of {{math|'''g'''}} and {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are elements of {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

This isn't precisely what would correspond to the [[direct product]] of infinitely many copies of {{math|'''g'''}}, one for each point in {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, because of the smoothness restriction. Instead, it can be thought of in terms of [[smooth map]] from {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|'''g'''}}; a smooth parametrized loop in {{math|'''g'''}}, in other words. This is why it is called the '''loop algebra'''.

==Loop group==
Similarly, a set of all smooth maps from {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} to a [[Lie group]] {{math|''G''}} forms an infinite-dimensional Lie group (Lie group in the sense we can define [[functional derivative]]s over it) called the '''[[loop group]]'''. The Lie algebra of a loop group is the corresponding loop algebra.

==Fourier transform==
We can take the [[Fourier transform]] on this loop algebra by defining

:&lt;math&gt;g\otimes t^n&lt;/math&gt;

as

:&lt;math&gt;g\otimes e^{-in\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:0 &amp;le; &amp;sigma; &lt;2&amp;pi;

is a coordinatization of {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

==Applications==
If {{math|'''g'''}} is a [[semisimple Lie algebra]], then a nontrivial [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]] of its loop algebra gives rise to an [[affine Lie algebra]].

'''Mathematical physics''' refers to the development of mathematical methods for application to problems in [[physics]]. The ''[[Journal of Mathematical Physics]]'' defines the field as "the application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories".&lt;ref&gt;Definition from the ''Journal of Mathematical Physics''. {{cite web |url=http://jmp.aip.org/jmp/staff.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003233339/http://jmp.aip.org/jmp/staff.jsp |archivedate=2006-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a branch of [[applied mathematics]], but deals with physical problems.

== Scope ==
There are several distinct branches of mathematical physics, and these roughly correspond to particular historical periods.

=== Classical mechanics ===
{{main|Lagrangian mechanics|Hamiltonian mechanics}}
The rigorous, abstract and advanced reformulation of Newtonian mechanics adopting the [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and the [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] even in the presence of constraints. Both formulations are embodied in [[analytical mechanics]]. It leads, for instance, to discover the deep interplay of the notion of symmetry{{clarifyme|date=January 2018}} and that of conserved quantities during the dynamical evolution{{clarifyme|date=January 2018}}, stated within the most elementary formulation of [[Noether theorem|Noether's theorem]]. These approaches and ideas can be, and in fact have been, extended to other areas of physics as [[statistical mechanics]], [[continuum mechanics]], [[classical field theory]] and  [[quantum field theory]]. Moreover, they have provided several examples and basic ideas in [[differential geometry]] (e.g. the theory of [[vector bundles]] and several notions in [[symplectic geometry]]).

=== Partial differential equations ===
{{main|Partial differential equations}}
The theory of [[partial differential equation]]s (and the related areas of [[variational calculus]], [[Fourier analysis]], [[potential theory]], and [[vector analysis]]) are perhaps most closely associated with mathematical physics. These were developed intensively from the second half of the 18th century (by, for example, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]], [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]) until the 1930s. Physical applications of these developments include [[hydrodynamics]], [[celestial mechanics]], [[continuum mechanics]], [[elasticity theory]], [[acoustics]], [[thermodynamics]], [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[aerodynamics]].

=== Quantum theory ===
{{main|Quantum mechanics}}
The theory of [[atomic spectra]] (and, later, [[quantum mechanics]]) developed almost concurrently with the mathematical fields of [[linear algebra]], the [[spectral theory]] of [[Operator (mathematics)|operators]], [[operator algebras]] and more broadly, [[functional analysis]]. Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics includes [[Schrödinger]] operators, and it has connections to [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics|atomic and molecular physics]]. [[Quantum information]] theory is another subspecialty.

=== Relativity and quantum relativistic theories ===
{{main|Theory of relativity|Quantum field theory}}
The [[Special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity|general]] theories of relativity require a rather different type of mathematics. This was [[group theory]], which played an important role in both quantum field theory and [[differential geometry]]. This was, however, gradually supplemented by [[topology]] and [[functional analysis]]  in the mathematical description of [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] as well as quantum field theory phenomena. In this area both [[homological algebra]] and [[category theory]] are important nowadays.

=== Statistical mechanics ===
{{main|Statistical mechanics}}
[[Statistical mechanics]] forms a separate field, which includes the theory of [[phase transition]]s. It relies upon the [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] (or its quantum version) and it is closely related with the more mathematical [[ergodic theory]] and some parts of [[probability theory]]. There are increasing interactions between [[combinatorics and physics]], in particular statistical physics.

== Usage ==
[[File:Mathematical Physics and other sciences.png|thumb]]
The usage of the term "mathematical physics" is sometimes [[idiosyncratic]]. Certain parts of mathematics that initially arose from the development of [[physics]] are not, in fact, considered parts of mathematical physics, while other closely related fields are. For example, [[ordinary differential equation]]s and [[symplectic geometry]] are generally viewed as purely mathematical disciplines, whereas [[dynamical system]]s and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] belong to mathematical physics. [[John Herapath]] used the term for the title of his 1847 text on "mathematical principles of natural philosophy"; the scope at that time being 
"the causes of heat, gaseous elasticity, gravitation, and other great phenomena of nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Herapath]] (1847) [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011557061?type%5B%5D=author&amp;lookfor%5B%5D=John%20Herapath&amp;ft=ft Mathematical Physics; or, the Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, the causes of heat, gaseous elasticity, gravitation, and other great phenomena of nature], Whittaker and company via [[HathiTrust]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematical vs. theoretical physics ===
The term "mathematical physics" is sometimes used to denote research aimed at studying and solving problems inspired by physics or [[thought experiment]]s within a mathematically [[mathematical rigour|rigorous]] framework. In this sense, mathematical physics covers a very broad academic realm distinguished only by the blending of pure [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. Although related to [[theoretical physics]],&lt;ref&gt;Quote: " ... a negative definition of the theorist refers to his inability to make physical experiments, while a positive one.. implies his encyclopaedic knowledge of physics combined with possessing enough mathematical armament. Depending on the ratio of these two components, the theorist may be nearer either to the experimentalist or to the mathematician. In the latter case, he is usually considered as a specialist in mathematical physics.", Ya. Frenkel, as related in A.T. Filippov, ''The Versatile Soliton'', pg 131. Birkhauser, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; mathematical physics in this sense emphasizes the mathematical rigour of the same type as found in mathematics.

On the other hand, theoretical physics emphasizes the links to observations and [[experimental physics]], which often requires theoretical physicists (and mathematical physicists in the more general sense) to use [[heuristic]], [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]], and approximate arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Quote: "Physical theory is something like a suit sewed for Nature. Good theory is like a good suit. ... Thus the theorist is like a tailor." Ya. Frenkel, as related in Filippov (2000), pg 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments are not considered rigorous by mathematicians, but that is changing over time.

Such mathematical physicists primarily expand and elucidate physical [[theories]]. Because of the required level of mathematical rigour, these researchers often deal with questions that theoretical physicists have considered to be already solved. However, they can sometimes show (but neither commonly nor easily) that the previous solution was incomplete, incorrect, or simply too naïve. Issues about attempts to infer the second law of thermodynamics from statistical mechanics are examples. Other examples concern the subtleties involved with synchronisation procedures in special and general relativity ([[Sagnac effect]] and [[Einstein synchronisation]])

The effort to put physical theories on a mathematically rigorous footing has inspired many mathematical developments. For example, the development of quantum mechanics and some aspects of [[functional analysis]] parallel each other in many ways. The mathematical study of quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and quantum statistical mechanics has motivated results in [[operator algebras]]. The attempt to construct a rigorous quantum field theory has also brought about progress in fields such as [[representation theory]]. Use of [[geometry]] and [[topology]] plays an important role in [[string theory]].

The roots of mathematical physics can be traced back to the likes of [[Archimedes]] in Greece, [[Ptolemy]] in Egypt, [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]] in [[Iraq]], and [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Al-Biruni]] in [[Persia]].

In the first decade of the 16th century, amateur astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] proposed [[heliocentrism]], and published a treatise on it in 1543. He retained the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] idea of [[epicycle]]s, and merely sought to simplify astronomy by constructing simpler sets of epicyclic orbits. Epicycles consist of circles upon circles. According to [[Aristotelian physics]], the circle was the perfect form of motion, and was the intrinsic motion of Aristotle's [[classical elements|fifth element]]—the quintessence or universal essence known in Greek as ''[[Aether (classical element|aether]]'' for the English ''pure air''—that was the pure substance beyond the [[sublunary sphere]], and thus was celestial entities' pure composition. The German [[Johannes Kepler]] [1571–1630], [[Tycho Brahe]]'s assistant, modified Copernican orbits to ''[[ellipse]]s'', formalized in the equations of Kepler's [[laws of planetary motion]].

An enthusiastic atomist, [[Galileo Galilei]] in his 1623 book ''The Assayer'' asserted that the "book of nature" is written in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Machamer [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/galileo "Galileo Galilei"]—sec 1 "Brief biography", in Zalta EN, ed, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Spring 2010 edn&lt;/ref&gt; His 1632 book, about his telescopic observations, supported heliocentrism.&lt;ref name=Flew1984p129&gt;Antony G Flew, ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), p [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA129 129]&lt;/ref&gt; Having introduced experimentation, Galileo then refuted geocentric [[cosmology]] by refuting Aristotelian physics itself. Galilei's 1638 book ''Discourse on Two New Sciences'' established the law of equal free fall as well as the principles of inertial motion, founding the central concepts of what would become today's [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Flew1984p129/&gt; By the Galilean [[law of inertia]] as well as the principle of [[Galilean invariance]], also called Galilean relativity, for any object experiencing inertia, there is empirical justification for knowing only that it is at ''relative'' rest or ''relative'' motion—rest or motion with respect to another object.

[[René Descartes]] adopted Galilean principles and developed a complete system of heliocentric cosmology, anchored on the principle of vortex motion, [[Cartesian physics]], whose widespread acceptance brought the demise of Aristotelian physics. Descartes sought to formalize mathematical reasoning in science, and developed [[Cartesian coordinates]] for geometrically plotting locations in 3D space and marking their progressions along the flow of time.&lt;ref&gt;Antony G Flew, ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), p [https://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=mathematical+reasoning 89]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first to use mathematical formulas to describe the laws of physics, and for that reason Huygens is regarded as the first [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] and the founder of mathematical physics.&lt;ref&gt;Dijksterhuis E.J (1950) ''De mechanisering van het wereldbeeld''. Meulenhoff, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andreessen, C.D. (2005) ''Huygens: The Man Behind the Principle''. Cambridge University Press: 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newtonian and post Newtonian===

[[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727) developed new mathematics, including [[calculus]] and several [[numerical methods]] such as [[Newton's method]] to solve problems in physics. Newton's theory of motion, published in 1687, modeled three Galilean laws of motion along with Newton's [[law of universal gravitation]] on a framework of [[absolute space]]—hypothesized by Newton as a physically real entity of Euclidean geometric structure extending infinitely in all directions—while presuming [[absolute time]], supposedly justifying knowledge of absolute motion, the object's motion with respect to absolute space. The principle of Galilean invariance/relativity was merely implicit in Newton's theory of motion. Having ostensibly reduced the Keplerian celestial laws of motion as well as Galilean terrestrial laws of motion to a unifying force, Newton achieved great mathematical rigor, but with theoretical laxity.&lt;ref name=Lakatos1980&gt;Imre Lakatos, auth, Worrall J &amp; Currie G, eds, ''The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes: Volume 1: Philosophical Papers'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980), pp [https://books.google.com/books?id=RRniFBI8Gi4C&amp;pg=PA213 213–214], [https://books.google.com/books?id=RRniFBI8Gi4C&amp;pg=PA220 220]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the Swiss [[Daniel Bernoulli]] (1700–1782) made contributions to [[fluid dynamics]], and [[vibrating string]]s. The Swiss [[Leonhard Euler]] (1707–1783) did special work in [[Calculus of variations|variational calculus]], dynamics, fluid dynamics, and other areas. Also notable was the Italian-born Frenchman, [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] (1736–1813) for work in [[analytical mechanics]]: he formulated [[Lagrangian mechanics]]) and variational methods. A major contribution to the formulation of Analytical Dynamics called [[Hamiltonian dynamics]] was also made by the Irish physicist, astronomer and mathematician, [[William Rowan Hamilton]] (1805-1865). Hamiltonian dynamics had played an important role in the formulation of modern theories in physics, including field theory and quantum mechanics. The French mathematical physicist [[Joseph Fourier]] (1768 – 1830) introduced the notion of [[Fourier series]] to solve the [[heat equation]], giving rise to a new approach to solving partial differential equations by means of [[integral transforms]].

Into the early 19th century, the French [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827) made paramount contributions to mathematical [[astronomy]], [[potential theory]], and [[probability theory]]. [[Siméon Denis Poisson]] (1781–1840) worked in [[analytical mechanics]] and potential theory. In Germany, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777–1855) made key contributions to the theoretical foundations of [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[mechanics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. In England, [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]] (1793-1841) published ''[[An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism]]'' in 1828, which in addition to its significant contributions to mathematics made early progress towards laying down the mathematical foundations of electricity and magnetism.

A couple of decades ahead of Newton's publication of a particle theory of light, the Dutch [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629–1695) developed the wave theory of light, published in 1690. By 1804, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s double-slit experiment revealed an interference pattern, as though light were a wave, and thus Huygens's wave theory of light, as well as Huygens's inference that light waves were vibrations of the [[luminiferous aether]], was accepted. [[Jean-Augustin Fresnel]] modeled hypothetical behavior of the aether. [[Michael Faraday]] introduced the theoretical concept of a field—not action at a distance. Mid-19th century, the Scottish [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1831–1879) reduced electricity and magnetism to Maxwell's electromagnetic field theory, whittled down by others to the four [[Maxwell's equations]]. Initially, optics was found consequent of{{clarifyme|date=January 2018}} Maxwell's field. Later, radiation and then today's known [[electromagnetic spectrum]] were found also consequent of{{clarifyme|date=January 2018}} this electromagnetic field.

The English physicist [[Lord Rayleigh]] [1842–1919] worked on [[sound]]. The Irishmen [[William Rowan Hamilton]] (1805–1865), [[George Gabriel Stokes]] (1819–1903) and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] (1824–1907) produced several major works: Stokes was a leader in [[optics]] and fluid dynamics; Kelvin made substantial discoveries in [[thermodynamics]]; Hamilton did notable work on [[analytical mechanics]], discovering a new and powerful approach nowadays known as [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. Very relevant contributions to this approach are due to his German colleague [[Carl Gustav Jacobi]] (1804–1851) in particular referring to [[canonical transformations]]. The German [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1821–1894) made substantial contributions in the fields of [[electromagnetism]], waves, [[fluid]]s, and sound. In the United States, the pioneering work of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] (1839–1903) became the basis for [[statistical mechanics]]. Fundamental theoretical results in this area were achieved by the German [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] (1844-1906). Together, these individuals laid the foundations of electromagnetic theory, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics.

===Relativistic===

By the 1880s, there was a prominent paradox that an observer within Maxwell's electromagnetic field measured it at approximately constant speed, regardless of the observer's speed relative to other objects within the electromagnetic field. Thus, although the observer's speed was continually lost{{clarifyme|date=January 2018}} relative to the electromagnetic field, it was preserved relative to other objects ''in'' the electromagnetic field. And yet no violation of [[Galilean invariance]] within physical interactions among objects was detected. As Maxwell's electromagnetic field was modeled as oscillations of the [[luminiferous aether|aether]], physicists inferred that motion within the aether resulted in [[aether drift]], shifting the electromagnetic field, explaining the observer's missing speed relative to it. The [[Galilean transformation]] had been the mathematical process used to translate the positions in one reference frame to predictions of positions in another reference frame, all plotted on [[Cartesian coordinates]], but this process was replaced by [[Lorentz transformation]], modeled by the Dutch [[Hendrik Lorentz]] [1853–1928].

In 1887, experimentalists Michelson and Morley failed to detect aether drift, however. It was hypothesized that motion ''into'' the aether prompted aether's shortening, too, as modeled in the [[Lorentz contraction]]. It was hypothesized that the aether thus kept Maxwell's electromagnetic field aligned with the principle of Galilean invariance across all [[inertial frames of reference]], while Newton's theory of motion was spared.

In the 19th century, [[Gauss]]'s contributions to [[non-Euclidean geometry]], or geometry on curved surfaces, laid the groundwork for the subsequent development of [[Riemannian geometry]] by [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1826–1866). Austrian theoretical physicist and philosopher [[Ernst Mach]] criticized Newton's postulated absolute space.  Mathematician [[Henri Poincaré|Jules-Henri Poincaré]] (1854–1912) questioned even absolute time. In 1905, [[Pierre Duhem]] published a devastating criticism of the foundation of Newton's theory of motion.&lt;ref name=Lakatos1980/&gt; Also in 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955) published his [[special theory of relativity]], newly explaining both the electromagnetic field's invariance and Galilean invariance by discarding all hypotheses concerning aether, including the existence of aether itself.  Refuting the framework of Newton's theory—[[absolute space and time|absolute space and absolute time]]—special relativity refers to ''relative space'' and ''relative time'', whereby ''length'' contracts and ''time'' dilates along the travel pathway of an object.

In 1908, Einstein's former professor [[Hermann Minkowski]] modeled 3D space together with the 1D axis of time by treating the temporal axis like a fourth spatial dimension—altogether 4D spacetime—and declared the imminent demise of the separation of space and time. Einstein initially called this "superfluous learnedness", but later used [[Minkowski spacetime]] with great elegance in his [[general theory of relativity]],&lt;ref&gt;Salmon WC &amp; Wolters G, eds, ''Logic, Language, and the Structure of Scientific Theories'' (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1994), p [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9K8llQufcMC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=superfluous+learnedness+Einstein+Minkowski+general+relativity 125]&lt;/ref&gt; extending invariance to all reference frames—whether perceived as inertial or as accelerated—and credited this to Minkowski, by then deceased. General relativity replaces Cartesian coordinates with [[Gaussian coordinates]], and replaces Newton's claimed empty yet Euclidean space traversed instantly by Newton's [[Euclidean vector|vector]] of hypothetical gravitational force—an instant [[action at a distance]]—with a gravitational ''field''. The gravitational field is Minkowski spacetime itself, the 4D [[topology]] of Einstein aether modeled on a [[Lorentzian manifold]] that "curves" geometrically, according to the [[Riemann curvature tensor]], in the vicinity of either mass or energy. (Under special relativity—a special case of general relativity—even massless energy exerts gravitational effect by its [[mass-energy equivalence|mass equivalence]] locally "curving" the geometry of the four, unified dimensions of space and time.)

===Quantum===
Another revolutionary development of the 20th century was [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], which emerged from the seminal contributions of [[Max Planck]] (1856–1947) (on [[Planck's law|black body radiation]]) and Einstein's work on the [[photoelectric effect]]. This was, at first, followed by a heuristic framework devised by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1868–1951) and [[Niels Bohr]] (1885–1962), but this was soon replaced by the [[quantum mechanics]] developed by [[Max Born]] (1882–1970), [[Werner Heisenberg]] (1901–1976), [[Paul Dirac]] (1902–1984), [[Erwin Schrödinger]] (1887–1961), [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] (1894–1974), and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] (1900–1958). This revolutionary theoretical framework is based on a probabilistic interpretation of states, and evolution and measurements in terms of [[self-adjoint operator]]s on an infinite dimensional vector space. That is called [[Hilbert space]], introduced in its elementary form by [[David Hilbert]] (1862–1943) and [[Frigyes Riesz]] (1880-1956), and rigorously defined within the axiomatic modern version by [[John von Neumann]] in his celebrated book ''[[Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics]]'', where he built up a relevant part of modern functional analysis on Hilbert spaces, the [[spectral theory]] in particular. Paul Dirac used algebraic constructions to produce a relativistic model for the [[electron]], predicting its [[magnetic moment]] and the existence of its antiparticle, the [[positron]].

Broadly, any '''metalanguage''' is language or symbols used when language itself is being discussed or examined.&lt;ref&gt;2010. ''Cambridge Advanced Learner‘s Dictionary''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]]. Dictionary online. Available from http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/metalanguage Internet. Retrieved 20 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In [[logic]] and [[linguistics]], a metalanguage is a language used to make statements about statements in another language (the [[object language]]). Expressions in a metalanguage are often distinguished from those in an object language by the use of italics, quotation marks, or writing on a separate line.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The structure of sentences and phrases in a metalanguage can be described by a [[metasyntax]].&lt;ref&gt;van Wijngaarden, A., et al. "[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-95279-1_2 Language and metalanguage]." Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 68. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1976. 17-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

There are a variety of recognized metalanguages, including ''embedded'', ''ordered'', and ''nested'' (or, ''hierarchical'').

=== Embedded ===

An '''embedded metalanguage''' is a language formally, naturally and firmly fixed in an object language. This idea is found in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', in a discussion of the relationship between formal languages and [[number theory]]: "... it is in the nature of any formalization of number theory that its metalanguage is embedded within it".&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter, Douglas]]. 1980. [[Gödel, Escher, Bach|''Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid'']]. New York: Vintage Books {{isbn|0-14-017997-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs in natural, or informal, languages, as well—such as in English, where words such as ''noun,'' ''verb,'' or even ''word'' describe features and concepts pertaining to the English language itself.

=== Ordered ===

An '''ordered metalanguage''' is analogous to [[ordered logic]]. An example of an ordered metalanguage is the construction of one metalanguage to discuss an object language, followed by the creation of another metalanguage to discuss the first, etc.

=== Nested ===

A '''nested''' (or, ''hierarchical'') '''metalanguage''' is similar to an ordered metalanguage in that each level represents a greater degree of abstraction. However, a nested metalanguage differs from an ordered one in that each level includes the one below. The [[paradigmatic]] example of a nested metalanguage comes from the [[Scientific classification|Linnean taxonomic system]] in biology. Each level in the system incorporates the one below it. The language used to discuss genus is also used to discuss species; the one used to discuss orders is also used to discuss genera, etc., up to kingdoms.

== In natural language ==

Natural language combines nested and ordered metalanguages. In a natural language there is an infinite regress of metalanguages, each with more specialized vocabulary and simpler syntax. Designating the language now as L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the grammar of the language is a discourse in the metalanguage L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a sublanguage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The grammar of L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which has the form of a factual description, is a discourse in the metametalanguage L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is also a sublanguage of L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The grammar of L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which has the form of a theory describing the syntactic structure of such factual descriptions, is stated in the metametametalanguage L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which likewise is a sublanguage of L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The grammar of L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has the form of a metatheory describing the syntactic structure of theories stated in L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and succeeding metalanguages have the same grammar as L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, differing only in reference. Since all of these metalanguages are sublanguages of L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a nested metalanguage, but L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and sequel are ordered metalanguages.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Since all these metalanguages are sublanguages of L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; they are all embedded languages with respect to the language as a whole.

Metalanguages of formal systems all resolve ultimately to natural language, the 'common parlance' in which mathematicians and logicians converse to define their terms and operations and 'read out' their formulae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Types of expressions ==
There are several entities commonly expressed in a metalanguage. In logic usually the object language that the metalanguage is discussing is a [[formal language]], and very often the metalanguage as well.

=== Deductive systems ===

{{Main|Deductive system}}

A '''deductive system''' (or, ''deductive apparatus'' of a [[formal system]]) consists of the [[axiom]]s (or [[axiom schema]]ta) and [[rules of inference]] that can be used to [[formal proof|derive]] the [[theorem]]s of the system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|Hunter, Geoffrey]]. 1971. ''Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First-Order Logic''. Berkeley:University of California Press {{isbn|978-0-520-01822-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metavariables ===

{{Main|Metavariable (logic)}}

A '''metavariable''' (or ''metalinguistic'' or ''metasyntactic'' variable) is a [[symbol (formal)|symbol]] or set of symbols in a metalanguage which stands for a symbol or set of symbols in some object language. For instance, in the sentence:

:Let ''A'' and ''B'' be arbitrary [[well-formed formula|formula]]s of a [[formal language]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;.

The symbols ''A'' and ''B'' are not symbols of the object language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, they are metavariables in the metalanguage (in this case, English) that is discussing the object language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Metatheories and metatheorems ===
{{Main|Metatheory|Metatheorem}}
A ''metatheory'' is a [[theory]] whose subject matter is some other theory (a theory about a theory). [[Statement (logic)|Statements]] made in the metatheory about the theory are called [[metatheorem]]s. A '''metatheorem''' is a [[truth|true]] statement about a [[formal system]] expressed in a metalanguage. Unlike theorems proved within a given formal system, a metatheorem is proved within a [[metatheory]], and may reference concepts that are present in the [[metatheory]] but not the [[object theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Ritzer|Ritzer, George]]. 1991. ''Metatheorizing in Sociology''. New York: Simon Schuster {{isbn|0-669-25008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpretations ===

{{Main|Interpretation (logic)}}

An '''interpretation''' is an [[Valuation (logic)|assignment]] of meanings to the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[word]]s of a language.

== Role in metaphor ==

Michael J. Reddy (1979) argues that much of the language we use to talk about language is conceptualized and structured by what he refers to as the [[conduit metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, Michael J. 1979. The conduit metaphor: A case of frame conflict in our language about language. In  Andrew Ortony (ed.), ''Metaphor and Thought''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; This paradigm operates through two distinct, related frameworks.

The ''major framework'' views language as a sealed pipeline between people:&lt;br /&gt;
'''1.''' Language transfers people's thoughts and feelings ([[mental content]]) to others
   ''ex:'' Try to get your thoughts across better.
'''2.''' Speakers and writers insert their mental content into words
   ''ex:'' You have to put each concept into words more carefully.
'''3.''' Words are containers
   ''ex:'' That sentence was filled with emotion.
'''4.''' Listeners and writers extract mental content from words
   ''ex:'' Let me know if you find any new sensations in the poem.

The ''minor framework'' views language as an open pipe spilling mental content into the void:&lt;br /&gt;
'''1.''' Speakers and writers eject mental content into an external space
   ''ex:'' Get those ideas out where they can do some good.
'''2.''' Mental content is reified (viewed as concrete) in this space
   ''ex:'' That concept has been floating around for decades.
'''3.''' Listeners and writers extract mental content from this space
   ''ex:'' Let me know if you find any good concepts in the essay.

== Metaprogramming ==

Computers follow programs, sets of instructions in a formal language.  The development of a [[programming language]] involves the use of a metalanguage. The act of working with metalanguages in programming is known as ''[[metaprogramming]]''. [[Backus–Naur form]], developed in the 1960s by John Backus and Peter Naur, is one of the earliest metalanguages used in computing. Examples of modern-day programming languages which commonly find use in metaprogramming include [[ML (programming language)|ML]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[m4 (computer language)|m4]], and [[Yacc]].

In [[mathematics]], '''mollifiers''' (also known as ''approximations to the identity'') are [[smooth function]]s with special properties, used for example in [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]] to create [[sequence]]s of smooth functions approximating nonsmooth [[Generalized function|(generalized) functions]], via [[convolution]]. Intuitively, given a function which is rather irregular, by convolving it with a mollifier the function gets "mollified", that is, its sharp features are smoothed, while still remaining close to the original nonsmooth (generalized) function.&lt;ref&gt;Respect to the [[topology]] of the given space of generalized functions.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known as '''Friedrichs mollifiers''' after [[Kurt Otto Friedrichs]], who introduced them.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harv|Friedrichs|1944|pp=136–139}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical notes ==

Mollifiers were introduced by [[Kurt Otto Friedrichs]] in his paper {{Harv|Friedrichs|1944|pp=136–139}}, which is considered a watershed in the modern theory of [[partial differential equations]].&lt;ref name="Laxref"&gt;See the commentary of [[Peter Lax]] on the paper {{Harv|Friedrichs|1944}} in {{Harv|Friedrichs|1986|loc=volume 1, p. 117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of this mathematical object had a curious genesis, and [[Peter Lax]] tells the whole story  in his commentary on that paper published in Friedrichs' "''Selecta''".&lt;ref name="Lax.p.117"&gt;{{Harv|Friedrichs|1986|loc=volume 1, p. 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, at that time, the mathematician [http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=342 Donald Alexander Flanders] was a colleague of Friedrichs: since he liked to consult colleagues about English usage, he asked Flanders an advice on how to name the smoothing operator he was using.&lt;ref name="Laxref" /&gt; Flanders was a [[puritan]], nicknamed by his friends Moll after [[Moll Flanders]] in recognition of his moral qualities: he suggested to call the new mathematical concept a "'''mollifier'''" as a pun incorporating both Flanders' nickname and the verb '[[Wiktionary:mollify|to mollify]]', meaning 'to smooth over' in a figurative sense.&lt;ref&gt;In {{Harv|Friedrichs|1986|loc=volume 1, p. 117}} Lax writes precisely that:-"''On English usage Friedrichs liked to consult his friend and colleague, Donald Flanders, a descendant of puritans and a puritan himself, with the highest standard of his own conduct, noncensorious towards others. In recognition of his moral qualities he was called Moll by his friends. When asked by Friedrichs what to name the smoothing operator, Flander sremarked that they could be named mollifier after himself; Friedrichs was delighted, as on other occasions, to carry this joke into print.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, [[Sergei Sobolev]] used mollifiers in his epoch making 1938 paper,&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harv|Sobolev|1938}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which contains the proof of the [[Sobolev embedding theorem]]: Friedrichs himself acknowledged Sobolev's work on mollifiers stating that:-"''These mollifiers were introduced by Sobolev and the author...''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Friedrichs|1953|p=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It must be pointed out that the term "mollifier" has undergone [[linguistic drift]] since the time of these foundational works: Friedrichs defined as "'''mollifier'''" the [[integral operator]] whose [[Integral operator|kernel]] is one of the functions nowadays called mollifiers. However, since the properties of a linear integral operator are completely determined by its kernel, the name mollfier was inherited by the kernel itself as a result of common usage.

== Definition ==
[[Image:Heat eqn.gif|right|frame|A function undergoing progressive mollification.]]

=== Modern (distribution based) definition ===
{{EquationRef|1|Definition 1.}} If ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'' is a [[smooth function]] on ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''n'' ≥ 1, satisfying the following three requirements

:{{EquationRef|2|(1){{spaces|2}}}} it is [[Support (mathematics)|compactly supported]]&lt;ref&gt;Such as a [[bump function]]&lt;/ref&gt;   
:{{EquationRef|3|(2){{spaces|2}}}}&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\!\varphi(x)\mathrm{d}x=1&lt;/math&gt;
:{{EquationRef|4|(3){{spaces|2}}}}&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\varphi_\epsilon(x) = \lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\epsilon^{-n}\varphi(x / \epsilon)=\delta(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirac delta function]] and the limit must be understood in the space of Schwartz [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s, then ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'' is a '''mollifier'''. The function ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'' could also satisfy further conditions:&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Giusti|1984|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, if it satisfies

:{{EquationRef|5|(4){{spaces|2}}}}''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt; ≥ 0 for all ''x'' ∈ ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', then it is called a '''positive mollifier'''
:{{EquationRef|6|(5){{spaces|2}}}}''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt;=''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;math&gt;(|x|)&lt;/math&gt; for some [[infinitely differentiable function]] ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;'' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ, then it is called a '''symmetric mollifier'''

===Notes on Friedrichs' definition===
'''Note 1'''. When the theory of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] was still not widely known nor used,&lt;ref&gt;As when the paper {{Harv|Friedrichs|1944}} was published, few years before [[Laurent Schwartz]] widespread his work.&lt;/ref&gt; property {{EquationNote|4|(3)}} above was formulated by saying that the [[convolution]] of the function ''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\varphi_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;'' with a given function belonging to a proper [[Hilbert space|Hilbert]] or [[Banach space]] [[Convergence (mathematics)|converge]]s as ''ε'' → 0  to that function:&lt;ref&gt;Obviously the [[topology]] with respect to convergence occurs is the one of the [[Hilbert space|Hilbert]] or [[Banach space]] considered.&lt;/ref&gt; this is exactly what [[Kurt Otto Friedrichs|Friedrichs]] did.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Friedrichs|1944|pp=136–138}}, properties '''PI''', '''PII''', '''PIII''' and their consequence '''PIII&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'''.&lt;/ref&gt; This also clarifies why mollifiers are related to [[approximate identity|approximate identities]].&lt;ref name="Fredref"&gt;Also, in this respect, {{harvtxt|Friedrichs|1944|pp=132}} says:-"''The main tool for the proof is a certain class of smoothing operators approximating unity, the "mollifiers"''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Note 2'''. As briefly pointed out in the "[[Mollifier#Historical notes|Historical notes]]" section of this entry, originally, the term "mollifier" identified the following [[Convolution|convolution operator]]:&lt;ref name="Fredref"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Friedrichs|1944|p=137}}, [[paragraph]] 2, "''Integral operators''".&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_\epsilon(f)(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\varphi_\epsilon(x-y) f(y)\mathrm{d}y&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\epsilon(x)=\epsilon^{-n}\varphi(x/\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; and ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'' is a [[smooth function]] satisfying the first three conditions stated above and one or more supplementary conditions as positivity and symmetry.

== Concrete example ==
Consider the [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt; of a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] in ℝ''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' defined by

&lt;math&gt;\varphi(x) = \begin{cases} e^{-1/(1-|x|^2)}/I_n&amp; \text{ if } |x| &lt; 1\\
                 0&amp; \text{ if } |x|\geq 1
                 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where the numerical constant &lt;math&gt; I_n&lt;/math&gt; ensures normalization. It is  easily seen that this function is [[Non-analytic smooth function|infinitely differentiable, non analytic]] with vanishing [[derivative]] for {{math|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{=}} 1}}. ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'' can be therefore used as mollifier as described above: it is also easy to see that ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt; defines a ''positive and symmetric mollifier''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harv|Hörmander|1990|p=14}}, [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] 1.2.3.: the example is stated in implicit form by first defining 
:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=\exp({-1/t})&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathbb{R}_+&lt;/math&gt;, 
and then considering 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=f\big(1-|x|^2\big)=\exp\big(1-|x|^2\big)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mollifier Illustration.svg|center|frame|The function ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt; in [[Dimension (mathematics)|dimension]] one]]

== Properties ==
All properties of a mollifier are related to its behaviour under the operation of [[convolution]]: we list the following ones, whose proofs can be found in every text on [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{Harv|Hörmander|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smoothing property===
For any distribution &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the following family of convolutions indexed by the [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_\epsilon = T\ast\varphi_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ast&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[convolution]], is a family of [[smooth function]]s.

=== Approximation of identity===
For any distribution &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the following family of convolutions indexed by the [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}T_\epsilon = \lim_{\epsilon\to 0}T\ast\varphi_\epsilon=T\in D^\prime(\mathbb{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Support of convolution===
For any distribution &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{supp}T_\epsilon=\mathrm{supp}(T\ast\varphi_\epsilon)\subset\mathrm{supp}T+\mathrm{supp}\varphi_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{supp}&lt;/math&gt; indicates the [[Distribution (mathematics)#Support of a distribution|support]] in the sense of distributions, and &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; indicates their [[Minkowski addition]].

== Applications ==
The basic applications of mollifiers is to prove properties valid for [[smooth function]]s also in nonsmooth situations:

=== Product of distributions ===
In some theories of [[generalized function]]s, mollifiers are used to define the [[Generalized function#Multiplication of distributions|multiplication of distributions]]: precisely, given two distributions &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the limit of the [[Distribution (mathematics)#Multiplication by a smooth function|product]] of a [[smooth function]] and a [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}S_\epsilon\cdot T=\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}S\cdot T_\epsilon\overset{\mathrm{def}}{=}S\cdot T&lt;/math&gt;

defines (if it exists) their product in various theories of [[generalized function]]s.

=== "Weak=Strong" theorems ===
Very informally, mollifiers are used to prove the identity of two different kind of extension of differential operators: the strong extension and the [[Weak formulation|weak extension]]. The paper {{Harv|Friedrichs|1944}} illustrates this concept quite well: however the high number of technical details needed to show what this really means prevent them from being formally detailed in this short description.

=== Smooth cutoff functions ===
By convolution of the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of the [[unit ball]] &lt;math&gt;B_1 = \{x : |x|&lt;1\}&lt;/math&gt; with the [[smooth function]] ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;'' (defined as in {{EquationNote|4|(3)}} with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;), one obtains the function

:&lt;math&gt;
\chi_{B_1,1/2}(x)=\chi_{B_1}\ast\varphi_{1/2}(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\!\!\!\chi_{B_1}(x-y)\varphi_{1/2}(y)\mathrm{d}y=\int_{B_{1/2}}\!\!\!
\chi_{B_1}(x-y) \varphi_{1/2}(y)\mathrm{d}y \ \ \ (\because\ \mathrm{supp}(\varphi_{1/2})=B_{1/2})
&lt;/math&gt;

which is a [[smooth function]] equal to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;B_{1/2} = \{ x: |x| &lt; 1/2 \}&lt;/math&gt;, with support contained in &lt;math&gt;B_{3/2}=\{ x: |x| &lt; 3/2 \}&lt;/math&gt;. This can be seen easily by observing that if &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|y|&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; |x-y|&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Hence for &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{B_{1/2}}\!\!\!\chi_{B_1}(x-y) \varphi_{1/2}(y)\mathrm{d}y= \int_{B_{1/2}}\!\!\!
 \varphi_{1/2}(y)\mathrm{d}y=1
&lt;/math&gt;.
It is easy to see how this construction can be generalized to obtain a smooth function identical to one on a [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]] of a given [[compact set]], and equal to zero in every point whose [[distance]] from this set is greater than a given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;A proof of this fact can be found in {{Harv|Hörmander|1990|p=25}}, Theorem 1.4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a function is called a (smooth) '''cutoff function''': those [[function (mathematics)|functions]] are used to eliminate singularities of a given ([[generalized function|generalized]]) [[function (mathematics)|function]] by [[multiplication]]. They leave unchanged the value of the ([[generalized function|generalized]]) [[function (mathematics)|function]] they multiply only on a given [[set (mathematics)|set]], thus modifying its [[Distribution (mathematics)#Support of a distribution|support]]: also cutoff functions are the basic parts of [[Smooth function#Smooth partitions of unity|smooth partitions of unity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5543">'''Morris Birkbeck Pell''' (31 March 1827, [[Albion, Illinois]], USA &amp;ndash; 7 May 1879, [[Glebe, New South Wales]], [[Australia]]) was an American-Australian [[mathematician]], professor, lawyer and [[actuary]].&lt;ref name="aus_bios_ref"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/pell-morris-birkbeck-4386|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=I. S.|last=Turner|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the inaugural Professor of Mathematics and [[Natural Philosophy]] at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1852, and continued in the role until ill health enforced his retirement in 1877. He was for many years a member of the University Senate, and councillor and secretary of the [[Royal Society of New South Wales]].

Pell's mother Eliza (1797-1880) was a daughter of [[Morris Birkbeck]] (1764-1825), the English agricultural innovator, social reformer and antislavery campaigner. In 1817-18 Birkbeck, with [[George Flower (reformer)|George Flower]], had founded a [[utopian]] colony, the [[English Settlement (Illinois)|English Settlement]], in the [[Illinois Territory]] of the [[United States]], and Birkbeck  laid out  the new town there of [[Albion, Illinois]]. A widower since 1804, Birkbeck had brought his seven children with him to America, and it was there that his daughter Eliza met and married Gilbert Titus Pell (1796-1860), who came from a prominent family of New York politicians. Gilbert Pell was descended from Sir John Pell (1643-1702), Lord of [[Pelham Manor, New York|Pelham Manor]], New York -- who was the son of English mathematician Dr. [[John Pell]] (1611-1685), and nephew and heir of early American pioneer and settler [[Thomas Pell]]. Gilbert Pell served as a representative in the Illinois legislature, and in the 1850s was appointed United States envoy to Mexico.

Morris Pell was born of this union in the new settlement of Albion in 1827, their third child and only son. In 1835 the family separated and Mrs Pell took her children first to Poughkeepsie, New York, then to Plymouth, England, in 1841, where Morris attended the New Grammar School. In 1849 he graduated as [[Senior Wrangler]] in mathematics at [[Cambridge University]]—a position once regarded as "the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain."&lt;ref name="Forfar 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forfar |first=David |title=What became of the Senior Wranglers?|journal=Mathematical Spectrum |volume=29 |issue=1 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852, aged 24, Pell was chosen from twenty-six candidates to become the first Professor of Mathematics and [[Natural Philosophy]] at the newly opened [[University of Sydney]], in the British [[colony of New South Wales]], Australia.&lt;ref name="aus_bios_ref" /&gt; With his new wife Jane Juliana (née Rusden), his mother and two sisters he sailed from England to Australia on the ''Asiatic'' and became one of the University's three foundation professors. Professor Pell gave the first lecture in Mathematics on 13 October 1852, two days after the University's inauguration, to all 24 students of the University. One of them, [[William Windeyer]], later to become Chancellor of the University, wrote in his diary: "Went to a lecture at 10 with Mr Pell, who amused as well as instructed, I think I shall like him ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/About/|title=About the School|website=www.maths.usyd.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, in evidence to a [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] select committee on education, Pell advocated the opening of a [[secular]] grammar school. In 1859 he testified to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] select committees on the Sydney Grammar School and the University of Sydney, regarding the composition of the University Senate, the adverse effect of clergy on enrolments, the value of liberal studies in the education of businessmen and [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]], and the beneficial effect of the university on secondary education. His evidence resulted in ex-officio membership of the University Senate for professors. He was a member of the Senate from 1861 to 1877 and after resignation was re-elected to the senate in 1878 by members of convocation.&lt;ref name="aus_bios_ref" /&gt;

Pell was a member of the [[Australian Philosophical Society]] from 1856 and served on its council in 1858. Subsequently, [[Queen Victoria]] granted [[Royal Assent]] to the Society and it was renamed the [[Royal Society of New South Wales]]. Pell was a member and its secretary from 1867, and a member of its council from 1869.

For many years almost crippled by an injury to his spine, Pell resigned in mid-1877 as professor of mathematics at Sydney University, on a pension of £412 10s. 
On 7 May 1879, aged 52, he died of "progressive paralysis" (see [[Motor neuron disease]]) and was buried in the [[Balmain Cemetery]] in Sydney. He was survived by his estranged wife Julia (née Rusden), five sons and three daughters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">In [[mathematics]], '''noncommutative harmonic analysis''' is the field in which results from [[Fourier analysis]] are extended to [[topological group]]s that are not [[commutative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gross, Kenneth I.|title=On the evolution of noncommutative harmonic analysis|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|volume=85|year=1978|pages=525–548|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/on-the-evolution-of-noncommutative-harmonic-analysis|doi=10.2307/2320861}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[locally compact abelian group]]s have a well-understood theory, [[Pontryagin duality]], which includes the basic structures of [[Fourier series]] and [[Fourier transform]]s, the major business of non-commutative [[harmonic analysis]] is usually taken to be the extension of the theory to all groups ''G'' that are [[locally compact]]. The case of [[compact group]]s is understood, qualitatively and after the [[Peter&amp;ndash;Weyl theorem]] from the 1920s, as being generally analogous to that of [[finite group]]s and their [[character theory]].

The main task is therefore the case of ''G'' that is locally compact, not compact and not commutative. The interesting examples include many [[Lie group]]s, and also [[algebraic group]]s over [[p-adic field]]s. These examples are of interest and frequently applied in [[mathematical physics]], and contemporary [[number theory]], particularly [[automorphic representation]]s.

What to expect is known as the result of basic work of [[John von Neumann]]. He showed that if the [[von Neumann group algebra]] of ''G'' is of type I, then ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'') as a [[unitary representation]] of ''G'' is a [[direct integral]] of irreducible representations. It is parametrized therefore by the [[unitary dual]], the set of isomorphism classes of such representations, which is given the [[hull-kernel topology]]. The analogue of the [[Plancherel theorem]] is abstractly given by identifying a measure on the unitary dual, the '''Plancherel measure''', with respect to which the direct integral is taken. (For Pontryagin duality the Plancherel measure is some Haar measure on the [[Pontryagin duality|dual group]] to ''G'', the only issue therefore being its normalization.) For general locally compact groups, or even countable discrete groups, the von Neumann group algebra need not be of type I and the regular representation of ''G'' cannot be written in terms of irreducible representations, even though it is unitary and completely reducible. An example where this happens is the infinite symmetric group, where the von Neumann group algebra is the hyperfinite type II&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; factor. The further theory divides up the Plancherel measure into a discrete and a continuous part. For [[semisimple group]]s, and classes of [[solvable Lie group]]s, a very detailed theory is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8y11t3mhLO8C&amp;dq=noncommutative+harmonic+analysis&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5F9yYP-aiM&amp;sig=ZznzekXInpNDhSAGfj9J8J1L9_g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=blaKStzfOoi-sgOto8HLDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Noncommutative Harmonic Analysis|author=Taylor, Michael E.|authorlink=Michael E.

In [[mathematics]] and [[abstract algebra]], a '''relation algebra''' is a [[residuated Boolean algebra]] [[reduct|expanded]] with an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] called '''converse''', a unary operation. The motivating example of a relation algebra is the algebra 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[binary relation]]s on a set ''X'', that is, subsets of the [[cartesian square]] ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with ''R''•''S'' interpreted as the usual [[Composition of relations|composition of binary relations]] ''R'' and ''S'', and with the converse of ''R'' as the [[converse relation]].

Relation algebra emerged in the 19th-century work of [[Augustus De Morgan]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]], which culminated in the [[algebraic logic]] of [[Ernst Schröder]]. The equational form of relation algebra treated here was developed by [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students, starting in the 1940s. Tarski and Givant (1987) applied relation algebra to a variable-free treatment of [[axiomatic set theory]], with the implication that mathematics founded on set theory could itself be conducted without variables.

==Definition==
A '''relation algebra''' (''L'', ∧, ∨, &lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, 0, 1, •, '''I''', ˘) is an algebraic structure equipped with the [[Introduction to Boolean algebra|Boolean operations]] of conjunction ''x''∧''y'', disjunction ''x''∨''y'', and negation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, the Boolean constants 0 and 1, the relational operations of [[composition of relations|composition]] ''x''•''y'' and [[converse relation|converse]] ''x''˘, and the relational constant '''I''', such that these operations and constants satisfy certain equations constituting an axiomatization of a [[algebraic logic#Calculus of relations|calculus of relations]]. Roughly, a relation algebra is to a system of binary relations on a set containing the [[empty relation|empty]] (0), [[universal relation|complete]] (1), and [[identity relation|identity]] ('''I''') relations and closed under these five operations as a [[group (mathematics)|group]] is to a system of [[permutation]]s of a set containing the identity permutation and closed under composition and inverse. However, the [[first-order logic|first order]] [[theory (logic)|theory]] of relation algebras is not [[completeness (logic)|complete]] for such systems of binary relations.

Following Jónsson and Tsinakis (1993) it is convenient to define additional operations ''x''◁''y'' = ''x''•''y''˘, and, dually,  ''x''▷''y'' = ''x''˘•''y'' .  Jónsson and Tsinakis showed that '''I'''◁''x'' = ''x''▷'''I''', and that both were equal to ''x''˘.  Hence a relation algebra can equally well be defined as an algebraic structure (''L'', ∧, ∨, &lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, 0, 1, •, '''I''', ◁, ▷).  The advantage of this [[signature (logic)|signature]] over the usual one is that a relation algebra can then be defined in full simply as a [[residuated Boolean algebra]] for which '''I'''◁''x'' is an involution, that is, '''I'''◁('''I'''◁''x'') = ''x'' .  The latter condition can be thought of as the relational counterpart of the equation 1/(1/''x'') = ''x'' for ordinary arithmetic [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]], and some authors use reciprocal as a synonym for converse.

Since residuated Boolean algebras are axiomatized with finitely many identities, so are relation algebras. Hence the latter form a [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]], the variety '''RA''' of relation algebras.  Expanding the above definition as equations yields the following finite axiomatization.

===Axioms===
The axioms '''B1-B10''' below are adapted from Givant (2006: 283), and were first set out by [[alfred Tarski|Tarski]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Tarski]] (1948) "Abstract: Representation Problems for Relation Algebras," ''Bulletin of the AMS'' 54: 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

''L'' is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] under binary [[disjunction]], ∨, and unary [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]] ()&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;:
:'''B1''': ''A'' ∨ ''B'' = ''B'' ∨ ''A''
:'''B2''': ''A'' ∨ (''B'' ∨ ''C'') = (''A'' ∨ ''B'') ∨ ''C''
:'''B3''': (''A''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ∨ ''B'')&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ∨ (''A''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ∨ ''B''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A''
This axiomatization of Boolean algebra is due to [[Edward Vermilye Huntington|Huntington]] (1933).  Note that the meet of the implied Boolean algebra is ''not'' the • operator (even though it distributes over &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt; like a meet does), nor is the 1 of the Boolean algebra the '''I''' constant.

''L'' is a [[monoid]] under binary [[composition of relations|composition]] (•) and [[nullary]] identity '''I''':

:'''B6''': ''A''˘˘ = ''A'' 
:'''B7''': (''A''•''B'')˘ = ''B''˘•''A''˘

Axiom B6 defines conversion as an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]], whereas B7 expresses the [[antidistributive]] property of conversion relative to composition.&lt;ref name="BrinkKahl1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Brink|author2=Wolfram Kahl|author3=Gunther Schmidt|title=Relational Methods in Computer Science|date=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-82971-4|pages=4 and 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Converse and composition [[distributive law|distribute]] over disjunction:
:'''B8''': (''A''∨''B'')˘ = ''A''˘∨''B''˘
:'''B9''': (''A''∨''B'')•''C'' = (''A''•''C'')∨(''B''•''C'')

'''B10''' is Tarski's equational form of the fact, discovered by [[Augustus De Morgan]], that ''A''•''B'' &amp;le; ''C''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  {{eqv}} ''A''˘•''C'' &amp;le; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  {{eqv}} ''C''•''B''˘ &amp;le; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.
:'''B10''': (''A''˘•(''A''•''B'')&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)∨''B''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

These axioms are [[ZFC]] theorems; for the purely Boolean '''B1-B3''', this fact is trivial. After each of the following axioms is shown the number of the corresponding theorem in Chapter 3 of Suppes (1960), an exposition of ZFC: '''B4''' 27, '''B5''' 45, '''B6''' 14, '''B7''' 26, '''B8''' 16, '''B9''' 23.

==Expressing properties of binary relations in RA==
The following table shows how many of the usual properties of [[binary relation]]s can be expressed as succinct '''RA''' equalities or inequalities. Below, an inequality of the form ''A''≤''B'' is shorthand for the Boolean equation ''A''∨''B'' = ''B''.

The most complete set of results of this nature is Chapter C of Carnap (1958), where the notation is rather distant from that of this entry. Chapter  3.2 of Suppes (1960) contains fewer results, presented as [[ZFC]] theorems and using a notation that more resembles that of this entry. Neither Carnap nor Suppes formulated their results using the '''RA''' of this entry, or in an equational manner.

==Expressive power==
The [[metamathematics]] of '''RA''' are discussed at length in Tarski and Givant (1987), and more briefly in Givant (2006).

'''RA''' consists entirely of equations manipulated using nothing more than uniform replacement and the substitution of equals for equals. Both rules are wholly familiar from school mathematics and from [[abstract algebra]] generally. Hence '''RA''' proofs are carried out in a manner familiar to all mathematicians, unlike the case in [[mathematical logic]] generally.

'''RA''' can express any (and up to [[logical equivalence]], exactly the) [[first-order logic]] (FOL) formulas containing no more than three variables. (A given variable can be quantified multiple times and hence quantifiers can be nested arbitrarily deeply by "reusing" variables.) Surprisingly, this fragment of FOL suffices to express [[Peano arithmetic]] and almost all [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatic set theories]] ever proposed. Hence '''RA''' is, in effect, a way of algebraizing nearly all mathematics, while dispensing with FOL and its [[Logical connective|connectives]], [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s, [[turnstile (symbol)|turnstiles]], and [[modus ponens]]. Because '''RA''' can express Peano arithmetic and set theory, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] apply to it; '''RA''' is [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incomplete]], incompletable, and [[undecidable problem|undecidable]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} (N.B. The Boolean algebra fragment of '''RA''' is complete and decidable.)

The '''representable relation algebras''', forming the class '''RRA''', are those relation algebras isomorphic to some relation algebra consisting of binary relations on some set, and closed under the intended interpretation of the '''RA''' operations. It is easily shown, e.g. using the method of [[pseudoelementary class]]es, that '''RRA''' is a [[quasivariety]], that is, axiomatizable by a [[universal Horn theory]]. In 1950, [[Roger Lyndon]] proved the existence of equations holding in '''RRA''' that did not hold in '''RA'''. Hence the variety generated by '''RRA''' is a proper subvariety of the variety '''RA'''. In 1955, [[Alfred Tarski]] showed that '''RRA''' is itself a variety. In 1964, Donald Monk showed that '''RRA''' has no finite axiomatization, unlike '''RA''', which is finitely axiomatized by definition.

===Q-relation algebras===
An '''RA''' is a Q-relation algebra ('''QRA''') if, in addition to '''B1-B10''', there exist some ''A'' and ''B'' such that (Tarski and Givant 1987: §8.4):

:'''Q0''': ''A''˘•''A'' ≤ '''I'''
:'''Q1''': ''B''˘•''B'' ≤ '''I'''
:'''Q2''': ''A''˘•''B'' = 1

Essentially these axioms imply that the universe has a (non-surjective) pairing relation whose projections are ''A'' and ''B''. It is a theorem that every '''QRA''' is a '''RRA''' (Proof by Maddux, see Tarski &amp; Givant 1987: 8.4(iii) ).

Every '''QRA''' is representable (Tarski and Givant 1987). That not every relation algebra is representable is a fundamental way '''RA''' differs from '''QRA''' and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]], which, by [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras]], are always representable as sets of subsets of some set, closed under union, intersection, and complement.

== Examples ==
1.  Any Boolean algebra can be turned into a '''RA''' by interpreting conjunction as composition (the monoid multiplication •), i.e. ''x''•''y'' is defined as ''x''∧''y''.  This interpretation requires that converse interpret identity (''ў'' = ''y''), and that both residuals ''y''\''x'' and ''x''/''y'' interpret the conditional ''y''→''x''  (i.e., ¬''y''∨''x'').

2.  The motivating example of a relation algebra depends on the definition of a binary relation ''R'' on a set ''X'' as any subset ''R'' ⊆ ''X''², where  ''X''² is the [[Cartesian square]] of ''X''. The power set 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; consisting of all binary relations on ''X'' is a Boolean algebra. While  2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; can be made a relation algebra by taking ''R''•''S'' = ''R''∧''S'', as per example (1) above, the standard interpretation of • is instead ''x''(''R''•''S'')''z'' = ∃''y'':''xRy.ySz''.  That is, the [[ordered pair]] (''x'',''z'') belongs to the relation ''R''•''S'' just when there exists ''y'' ∈ ''X'' such that (''x'',''y'') ∈ ''R'' and (''y'',''z'') ∈ ''S''. This interpretation uniquely determines ''R''\''S'' as consisting of all pairs (''y'',''z'') such that for all ''x'' ∈ ''X'', if ''xRy'' then ''xSz''. Dually, ''S''/''R'' consists of all pairs (''x'',''y'') such that for all ''z'' ∈ ''X'', if ''yRz'' then ''xSz''. The translation ''ў'' = ¬(y\¬'''I''') then establishes the converse ''R''˘ of ''R'' as consisting of all pairs (''y'',''x'') such that (''x'',''y'') ∈ ''R''.

3.  An important generalization of the previous example is the power set 2&lt;sup&gt;''E''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''E'' ⊆ ''X''² is any [[equivalence relation]] on the set ''X''. This is a generalization because ''X''² is itself an equivalence relation, namely the complete relation consisting of all pairs. While 2&lt;sup&gt;''E''&lt;/sup&gt; is not a subalgebra of 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; when ''E'' ≠ ''X''² (since in that case it does not contain the relation ''X''², the top element 1 being ''E'' instead of ''X''²), it is nevertheless turned into a relation algebra using the same definitions of the operations. Its importance resides in the definition of a ''representable relation algebra'' as any relation algebra isomorphic to a subalgebra of the relation algebra 2&lt;sup&gt;''E''&lt;/sup&gt; for some equivalence relation ''E'' on some set. The previous section says more about the relevant metamathematics.

4. Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be group. Then the power set &lt;math&gt;2^G&lt;/math&gt; is a relation algebra with the obvious boolean algebra operations, composition given by the [[product of group subsets]], the converse by the inverse subset (&lt;math&gt;A^{-1} = \{a^{-1}\mid a\in A\}&lt;/math&gt;), and the identity by the singleton subset &lt;math&gt;\{e\}&lt;/math&gt;. There is a relation algebra homomorphism embedding &lt;math&gt;2^G&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;2^{G\times G}&lt;/math&gt; which sends each subset &lt;math&gt;A\subset G&lt;/math&gt; to the relation
&lt;math&gt;R_A = \{(g, h)\in G \times G\mid h\in A g\}&lt;/math&gt;. The image of this homomorphism is the set of all right-invariant relations on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. 

5. If group sum or product interprets composition, [[Group_(mathematics)#Definition|group inverse]] interprets converse, group identity interprets '''I''', and if ''R'' is a [[one-to-one correspondence]], so that ''R''˘•''R'' = ''R•R''˘ = '''I''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Tarski|Tarski, A.]] (1941), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; then ''L'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] as well as a [[monoid]]. '''B4'''-'''B7''' become well-known theorems of [[group theory]], so that '''RA''' becomes a [[proper extension]] of [[group theory]] as well as of Boolean algebra.

==Historical remarks==
[[augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] founded '''RA''' in 1860, but [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] took it much further and became fascinated with its philosophical power. The work of DeMorgan and Peirce came to be known mainly in the extended and definitive form [[Ernst Schröder]] gave it in Vol. 3 of his ''Vorlesungen'' (1890–1905). ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' drew strongly on Schröder's '''RA''', but acknowledged him only as the inventor of the notation. In 1912, [[Alwin Korselt]] proved that a particular formula in which the quantifiers were nested four deep had no '''RA''' equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Korselt did not publish his finding. It was first published in [[Leopold Loewenheim]] (1915) "Über Möglichkeiten im Relativkalkül," ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'' 76: 447–470. Translated as "On possibilities in the calculus of relatives" in [[Jean van Heijenoort]], 1967. ''A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879–1931''. Harvard Univ. Press: 228–251.&lt;/ref&gt; This fact led to a loss of interest in '''RA''' until Tarski (1941) began writing about it. His students have continued to develop '''RA''' down to the present day. Tarski returned to '''RA''' in the 1970s with the help of Steven Givant; this collaboration resulted in the monograph by Tarski and Givant (1987), the definitive reference for this subject. For more on the history of '''RA''', see Maddux (1991, 2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6360">In [[computer science]], the '''shortest common supersequence''' of two sequences '''X''' and '''Y''' is the shortest sequence which has '''X''' and '''Y''' as [[subsequence]]s. This is a problem closely related to the [[longest common subsequence problem]]. Given two sequences '''X''' = &lt; x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; and '''Y''' = &lt; y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;, a sequence '''U''' = &lt; u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,u&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; is a common supersequence of '''X''' and '''Y''' if items can be removed from '''U''' to produce '''X''' or '''Y'''.

A shortest common supersequence (SCS) is a common supersequence of minimal length. In the shortest common supersequence problem, the two sequences '''X''' and '''Y''' are given and the task is to find a shortest possible common supersequence of these sequences. In general, an SCS is not unique.

For two input sequences, an SCS can be formed from a longest common subsequence (LCS) easily. For example, if '''X'''&lt;math&gt;[1..m] = abcbdab&lt;/math&gt; and '''Y'''&lt;math&gt;[1..n] = bdcaba&lt;/math&gt;, the lcs is '''Z'''&lt;math&gt;[1..r] = bcba&lt;/math&gt;. By inserting the non-lcs symbols while preserving the symbol order, we get the SCS: '''U'''&lt;math&gt;[1..t] = abdcabdab&lt;/math&gt;.

It is quite clear that &lt;math&gt; r + t = m + n &lt;/math&gt; for two input sequences. However, for three or more input sequences this does not hold. Note also, that the lcs and the SCS problems are not [[dual problem]]s.

&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can be formulated as an instance of [[Set cover problem#Weighted set cover|weighted set cover]] in such a way that the weight of the optimal solution to the set cover instance is less than twice the length of the shortest superstring {{var|S}}. One can then use the [[Approximation algorithm#Performance guarantees|O(log({{var|n}}))-approximation]] for weighted set-cover to obtain an O(log({{var|n}}))-approximation for the shortest superstring (note that this is ''not'' a constant factor approximation).

For any string {{var|x}} in this alphabet, define {{var|P}}({{var|x}}) to be the set of all strings which are substrings of {{var|x}}. The instance {{var|I}} of set cover is formulated as follows: 
* Let {{var|M}} be empty.
* For each pair of strings {{var|s}}&lt;sub&gt;{{var|i}}&lt;/sub&gt; and {{var|s}}&lt;sub&gt;{{var|j}}&lt;/sub&gt;, if the last {{var|k}} symbols of {{var|s}}&lt;sub&gt;{{var|i}}&lt;/sub&gt; are the same as the first {{var|k}} symbols of {{var|s}}&lt;sub&gt;{{var|j}}&lt;/sub&gt;, then add a string to {{var|M}} that consists of the concatenation with maximal overlap of {{var|s}}&lt;sub&gt;{{var|i}}&lt;/sub&gt; with {{var|s}}&lt;sub&gt;{{var|j}}&lt;/sub&gt;. 
* Define the universe &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt; of the set cover instance to be {{var|S}}
* Define the set of subsets of the universe to be { {{var|P}}({{var|x}}) | {{var|x}} ∈ {{var|S}} ∪ {{var|M}} }
* Define the cost of each subset {{var|P}}(x) to be |{{var|x}}|, the length of {{var|x}}.

The instance {{var|I}} can then be solved using an algorithm for weighted set cover, and the algorithm can output an arbitrary concatenation of the strings {{var|x}} for which the weighted set cover algorithm outputs {{var|P}}({{var|x}}).{{sfn|Vazirani|p=20}}

=== Example ===

Consider the set {{var|S}} = { abc, cde, fab }, which becomes the universe of the weighted set cover instance. In this case, {{var|M}} = { abcde, fabc }. Then the set of subsets of the universe is
:&lt;math displaystyle="block"&gt;
\begin{align}
  \{ P(x) | x\in S\cup M \} 
  &amp;= \{ P(x) | x\in \{ abc, cde, fab, abcde, fabc \} \} \\
  &amp;= \{ P(abc), P(cde), P(fab), P(abcde), P(fabc) \} \} \\
  &amp;= \{ \{a,b,c,ab,bc,abc\}, \{c,d,e,cd,de,cde\},\ldots, \{f,a,b,c,fa,ab,bc,fab,abc,fabc\} \} \} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
which have costs 3, 3, 3, 5, and 4, respectively.

'''Sones GraphDB''' was a [[graph database]] developed by the German company sones GmbH, available from 2010 to 2012. Its last version was released in May 2011. sones GmbH, which was based in [[Erfurt]] and [[Leipzig]], was declared bankrupt on January 1, 2012.

GraphDB was unique in that its design based on weighted graphs. The open source edition was released in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/open/meldung/sones-gibt-Quellcode-der-GraphDB-frei-1032398.html Announcement of open source version (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; The commercially available enterprise version offered a wider variety of functions.

GraphDB was developed in the programming language [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and ran on [[Microsoft]]'s [[.NET Framework]] and on the open source reimplementation [[Mono (software)|Mono]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_2.8 Mono Release Notes 2.8 mit Verweis auf GraphDB]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2010-09-11-004-35-NW-SW .NET versus Mono Benchmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

GraphDB was available as [[software as a service]] (SaaS) on the [[Microsoft]] cloud [[Azure Services Platform]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/developer/meldung/GraphDB-als-SaaS-fuer-Windows-Azure-1049816.html Azure SaaS Announcement (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; GraphDB was also a component of an open source [[solution stack]].

In 2014 the trademark "GraphDB" was acquired by [[Ontotext]]. OWLIM, Ontotext's [[graph database]] and RDF [[triplestore]], was renamed GraphDB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/08/prweb12092869.htm Ontotext Improves Its RDF Triplestore, GraphDB 6.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionality  ==
GraphDB had index-free [[adjacent (graph theory)|adjacency]], which meant that it not necessary to manage a global index for relationships between nodes/entities. The linked objects contained direct reference to their adjacent neighboring nodes.

The sones graph database was able to store and retrieve unstructured properties in any node of the graph. The idea was also to transfer unstructured data to structured data and vice versa.

Structured data could be dynamically extended with high performance in nodes and edges during runtime. Additional properties could easily be entered or deleted from vertex types in a short amount of time.

GraphDB used its own query language, GraphQL, which was similar to SQL. It could be dynamically extended during runtime using plugins such as functions or aggregates.

GraphDB used an object-oriented concept, which enabled better integration into [[object-oriented programming]] languages.

== Interfaces ==
=== REST API===
In addition to providing a number of interfaces (e.g., [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], WebShell, [[WebDAV]]) the sones graph database also offers a REST API. This enables simpler interaction with state-of-the-art web technologies. A REST-query is all that is needed to execute CRUD operations directly on the database.

=== Traverser API ===
The Traverser API makes it possible to analyze local data. Based on a number of nodes (local), neighboring nodes can be searched recursively (breadth-depth first).

== Architecture ==
GraphDB has a modular structure consisting of 4 application layers. The storage engines act as the interface to different storage media. The GraphFS serializes and deserializes database objects (nodes and edges) and operates the available storage engines. The actual graph-oriented database logic as well as all functionalities specific to the database are implemented in the GraphDB. The GraphDS provides the interface for using the database. The interfaces between the application layers are generic, which makes it possible to update components separately.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4598">[[Image:Graph star coloring.svg|thumb|right|300px|The star chromatic number of [[Dyck graph]] is 4, while the chromatic number is 2.]]
In [[graph theory|graph-theoretic]] [[mathematics]], a '''star coloring''' of a graph ''G'' is a [[Graph coloring|(proper) vertex coloring]] in which every [[Path (graph theory)|path on four vertices]] uses at least three distinct colors. Equivalently, in a star coloring, the [[induced subgraph]]s formed by the vertices of any two colors has [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]s that are [[star graph]]s. Star coloring has been introduced by {{harvtxt|Grünbaum|1973}}.
The '''star chromatic number''' &lt;math&gt;\chi_s(G)&lt;/math&gt; of ''G'' is the least number of colors needed to star color ''G''.

One generalization of star coloring is the closely related concept of [[acyclic coloring]], where it is required that every cycle uses at least three colors, so the two-color induced subgraphs are [[forest (graph theory)|forests]].  If we denote the acyclic chromatic number of a graph ''G'' by &lt;math&gt;\chi_a(G)&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;\chi_a(G) \leq \chi_s(G)&lt;/math&gt;, and in fact every star coloring of ''G'' is an acyclic coloring.

The star chromatic number has been proved to be bounded on every proper minor closed class by {{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2003}}. This results was further generalized by {{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2006}} to all low-tree-depth colorings (standard coloring and star coloring being low-tree-depth colorings with respective parameter 1 and 2).

== Complexity ==
It was demonstrated by {{harvtxt|Albertson|Chappell|Kierstead|Kündgen|2004}} that it is [[NP-complete]] to determine whether &lt;math&gt;\chi_s(G) \leq 3&lt;/math&gt;, even when ''G'' is a graph that is both [[planar graph| planar]] and [[bipartite graph|bipartite]].
{{harvtxt|Coleman|Moré|1984}} showed that finding an optimal star coloring is [[NP-hard]] even when ''G'' is a bipartite graph.

In [[mathematics]], a '''Thue equation''' is a [[Diophantine equation]] of the form

:''&amp;fnof;''(''x'',''y'') = ''r'',

where ''ƒ'' is an [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] bivariate [[Algebraic form|form]] of degree at least 3 over the rational numbers, and ''r'' is a nonzero [[rational number]]. It is named after [[Axel Thue]] who in 1909 proved a [[theorem]], now called '''Thue's theorem''', that a Thue equation has finitely many solutions in integers ''x'' and ''y''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A.

The Thue equation is [[Effective results in number theory|solvable effectively]]: there is an explicit bound on the solutions ''x'', ''y'' of the form &lt;math&gt;(C_1 r)^{C_2}&lt;/math&gt; where constants ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; depend only on the form ''ƒ''.   A stronger result holds, that if ''K'' is the field generated by the roots of ''ƒ'' then the equation has only finitely many solutions with ''x'' and ''y'' integers of ''K'' and again these may be effectively determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Alan | last=Baker | authorlink=Alan Baker (mathematician) | title=Transcendental Number Theory | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1975 | isbn=0-521-20461-5 | page=38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cybernetics]], the term '''variety''' denotes the total number of distinct states of a [[system]].

== Overview ==
The term Variety was introduced by [[W. Ross Ashby]] to denote the count of the total number of states of a system. The condition for dynamic stability under [[wiktionary:perturbation|perturbation]] (or input) was described by his Law of Requisite Variety. Ashby says:&lt;ref&gt;Ashby (1956) p 124&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thus, if the order of occurrence is ignored, the collection&lt;br /&gt;c, b, c, a, c, c, a, b, c, b, b, a&lt;br /&gt;
which contains twelve elements, contains only three ''distinct'' elements- a, b, c. Such a set will be said to have a '''variety''' of three elements.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He adds &lt;blockquote&gt;
The observer and his powers of discrimination may have to be specified if the variety is to be well defined.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby (1956) p125&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Variety can be stated as an integer, as above, or as the logarithm to the base 2 of the number ''i.e.'' in [[bit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby (1956) p126&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law of Requisite Variety===
If a system is to be stable, the number of states of its control mechanism must be greater than or equal to the number of states in the system being controlled. Ashby states the Law as "variety can destroy variety".&lt;ref&gt;Ashby (1956) p207&lt;/ref&gt; He sees this as aiding the study of problems in biology and a "wealth of possible applications" . He sees his approach as introductory to Shannon Information [[A Mathematical Theory of Communication|Theory]] (1948) which deals with the case of "incessant fluctuations" or noise. The Requisite Variety condition can be seen as a simple statement of a necessary dynamic equilibrium condition in [[information theory]] terms ''cf.'' [[Newton's third law]], [[Le Chatelier's principle]].

''&lt;small&gt;A system has good Control if and only if the dependent variables remain the same even when the independent variables or the State Function have changed. In a real system this implies that the State Function is a composition of two functions, such that the second is the inverse of ( the possible changes of ) the first:

y = F(G(x))
where

F = controller system's function of state

G = controlled system's function of state

x = inputs, OR, independent variables

y = outputs, OR, dependent variables&lt;/small&gt;''.

Later, in 1970, Conant working with Ashby produced the [[good regulator]] theorem &lt;ref&gt;Conant 1970&lt;/ref&gt; which required [[autonomous]] [[systems]] to acquire an internal model of their environment to persist and achieve stability (e.g. [[Nyquist stability criterion]]) or [[dynamic equilibrium]].

[[Stafford Beer]] defines variety as "the total number of ''possible'' states of a system, or of an element of a system",&lt;ref name="Beer 1981"&gt;Beer (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; ''cf.'' [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s [[Boltzmann's entropy formula|Wahrscheinlichkeit]]. Beer restates the Law of Requisite Variety as "Variety absorbs variety".&lt;ref&gt;Beer (1979) p286&lt;/ref&gt;  Stated more simply the logarithmic measure of variety represents the minimum number of choices (by [[binary chop]]) needed to resolve [[uncertainty]]. Beer used this to allocate the management resources necessary to maintain process viability.

Variety is one of nine requisites that are required by an [[ethical regulator]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Ashby, [http://ashby.de/Ethical%20Regulators.pdf "Ethical Regulators and Super-Ethical Systems"], 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Applications ==
In general a description of the required inputs and outputs is established then [[encoder|encoded]] with the minimum variety necessary. The mapping of input bits to output bits can then produce an estimate of the minimum hardware or software components necessary to produce the desired [[Control system|control]] behaviour; for example, in a piece of [[computer software]] or [[computer hardware]].

The cybernetician [[Frank George]] discussed the variety of teams competing in games like football or rugby to produce goals or tries. A winning chess player might be said to have more variety than his losing opponent. Here a simple [[order (group theory)|ordering]] is implied. The [[attenuation]] and [[Amplifier|amplification]] of variety were major themes in Stafford Beer's work in management &lt;ref name="Beer 1981"/&gt; (the profession of control, as he called it).  The number of staff needed to answer telephones, control crowds or tend to patients are clear examples.

The application of natural and analogue signals to variety analysis require an estimate of Ashby's "powers of discrimination" (see above quote). Given the [[butterfly effect]] of [[dynamical systems]] care must be taken before quantitative measures can be produced. Small quantities, which might be overlooked, can have big effects. In his ''Designing Freedom'' Stafford Beer discusses the patient in a hospital with a temperature denoting fever.&lt;ref&gt;Beer (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Action must be taken immediately to isolate the patient. Here no amount of variety recording the ''patients' average temperature'' would detect this small signal which might have a big effect. Monitoring is required on individuals thus amplifying variety (see ''Algedonic alerts'' in the [[viable system model]] or VSM). Beer's work in management cybernetics and VSM is largely based on variety engineering.

Further applications involving Ashby's view of state counting include the analysis of digital [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] requirements, [[Redundant code|redundancy]] and [[software bloat]], the bit representation of [[data types]] and [[B-tree|indexes]], [[analog-to-digital converter|analogue to digital conversion]], the bounds on [[finite state machines]] and [[data compression]]. See also, e.g., [[Excited state]], [[State (computer science)]], [[State pattern]], [[State (controls)]] and [[Cellular automaton]]. Requisite Variety can be seen in Chaitin's [[Algorithmic information theory]] where a longer, higher variety program or finite state machine produces incompressible output with more variety or information content.

Recently&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist 24 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Lovelock]] suggested burning and burying [[Carbonization|carbonized]] agricultural waste to [[Carbon Sequestration|sequester carbon]]. A variety calculation requires estimates of global annual agricultural waste production, burial and [[biochar|pyrolysis]] efficiency to estimate the mass of carbon thus sequestered from the atmosphere.

'''Zvezdelina Entcheva Stankova''' ({{lang-bg|Звезделина Енчева Станкова}}; born 15 September 1969) is a professor of mathematics at [[Mills College]] and a teaching professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the founder of the Berkeley Math Circle, and an expert in the [[Enumerative combinatorics|combinatorial enumeration]] of [[Permutation pattern|permutations with forbidden patterns]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.proofschool.org/stankova/ |title=Zvezdelina Stankova|publisher=Proof School&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Biography==
Stankova was born in [[Ruse, Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name="whiz"/&gt; She began attending the Ruse [[math circle]] as a fifth grader in Bulgaria, the same year she learned to solve the [[Rubik's Cube]]&lt;ref name="weld"/&gt; and began winning regional mathematics competitions.&lt;ref name="proof"/&gt; She later wrote of this experience that "if I was not a member of Ruse SMC I would not be able to make such profound achievements in mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.math.bas.bg/talents/en/prep/RSMC.pdf|title=Ruse Students Mathematical Circle|publisher=Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=2016-02-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She became a student at an elite English-language high school, and competed on the Bulgarian team in the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]s in 1987 and 1988, earning silver medals both times.&lt;ref name="whiz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=1599|title=Participant record: Zvezdelina Stankova|publisher=[[International Mathematical Olympiad]]|accessdate=2016-02-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She entered [[Sofia University]] but in 1989, as the [[Iron Curtain]] was falling, became one of 15 Bulgarian students selected to travel to the US to complete their studies.&lt;ref name="whiz"&gt;{{citation|url=http://articles.philly.com/1991-10-23/news/25814612_1_math-talent-sofia-university-algebra |title=Bulgarian Math Whiz Wows 'Em: Zvezdelina Stankova Already Is Joining The Ranks Of Top Mathematicians. "She's A Genius," Says Bryn Mawr's Head Of Math|first=Ralph|last=Vigoda|date=October 23, 1991|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stankova studied at [[Bryn Mawr College]], completing bachelor's and master's degrees there in 1992,&lt;ref name="mills"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mills.edu/academics/faculty/math/stankova/stankova.php|title=Zvezdelina Stankova|work=Mathematics Faculty and Staff|publisher=Mills College|accessdate=2016-02-01}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Rhonda Hughes]] as a faculty mentor.&lt;ref name="alumnews"/&gt; While an undergraduate, she participated in a summer research program with [[Joseph Gallian]] at the [[University of Minnesota Duluth]], which began her interest in [[permutation pattern]]s.&lt;ref name="schafer"/&gt; Next, she went to [[Harvard University]] for her doctoral studies, and earned a Ph.D. there in 1997; her dissertation, entitled ''Moduli of Trigonal Curves'', was supervised by [[Joe Harris (mathematician)|Joe Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=18792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as Morrey Assistant Professor of Mathematics&lt;ref name="ucb"/&gt; before joining the Mills College faculty in 1999,&lt;ref name="mills"/&gt; and continues to teach one course per year as a visiting professor at Berkeley.&lt;ref name="haimo"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ams.org/profession/prize-booklet-2011.pdf|work=January 2011 Prizes and Awards|date=January 7, 2011|publisher=American Mathematical Society|title=Haimo Award Citation: Zvezdelina Stankova|page=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://math.berkeley.edu/~stankova/|title=Stankova's home page at Berkeley|accessdate=2016-02-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She also serves on the advisory board of the [[Proof School]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="proof"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.proofschool.org/stankova/|title=Zvezdelina Stankova|work=Mathematical Sciences Advisory Board|publisher=[[Proof School]]|accessdate=2016-02-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
In the theory of [[permutation pattern]]s, Stankova is known for proving that the permutations with the forbidden pattern 1342 are equinumerous with the permutations with forbidden pattern 2413, an important step in the enumeration of permutations avoiding a pattern of length 4.&lt;ref name="schafer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bona"&gt;{{citation|title=Combinatorics of Permutations|edition=2nd|series=Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications|first=Miklos|last=Bona|publisher=CRC Press|year=2012|isbn=9781439850527|pages=154–155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3nRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 she became the founder and director of the Berkeley [[Math circle|Math Circle]], an after-school mathematics enrichment program that Stankova modeled after her early experiences learning mathematics in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="weld"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.themonthly.com/feature1404.html|magazine=[[The East Bay Monthly]]|first=Sarah|last=Weld|date=April 2014|title=Proving Their Passion: The Berkeley Math Circle gives math kids a place to find solutions—together}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alumnews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Circle in a Box|volume=2|series=MSRI mathematical circles library|publisher=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and American Mathematical Society|first=Sam|last=Vandervelde|year=2009|isbn=9780821847527|pages=4, 34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wkZ-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.1011now.com/home/headlines/Moms-Everyday-Making-Math-Fun-228617341.html|title=Moms Everyday: Making Math Fun|date=October 21, 2013|first=Melanie|last=Bloom|publisher=[[KOLN|10/11]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Berkeley circle was only the second math circle in the US (after one in Boston); following its success, over 100 other circles have been created,&lt;ref name="weld"/&gt; and Stankova has assisted in the formation of many of them.&lt;ref name="haimo"/&gt;
With Tom Rike, she is co-editor of two books about her work with the Berkeley Math Circle, ''A Decade of the Berkeley Math Circle: The American Experience'' (Vol. I, 2008, Vol. II, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=MSRI Mathematical Circles Library|url=https://www.mathcircles.org/content/math-circle-library|publisher=National Association of Math Circles|accessdate=2016-02-01}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1998, she founded the Bay Area Mathematical Olympiad.&lt;ref name="ucb"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/99legacy/2-10-1999.html|title=UC Berkeley mathematicians feed the minds of young local math whizzes|first=Tamara|last=Keith|date=February 10, 1999|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For six years, she served as a coach of the US [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] team.&lt;ref name="alumnews"&gt;{{citation|url=http://alumnews.blogs.brynmawr.edu/2011/04/06/zvezdelina-stankova-%E2%80%9992-carries-on-a-bryn-mawr-tradition-excellent-teaching-in-mathematics/|title=Zvezdelina Stankova ’92 Carries on a Bryn Mawr Tradition: Excellent Teaching in Mathematics|date=April 6, 2011|first=Katherine|last=Bakke|work=Meaningful Contributions|publisher=Bryn Mawr College}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abc7"/&gt;

Since 2013, she has featured in several videos on the mathematics-themed [[YouTube]] channel "[[Numberphile]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Numberphile|title=Pebbling a Chessboard - Numberphile|date=2013-12-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQGSGsXbXE|accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 1992, Stankova won the Alice T. Schafer Prize of the [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] for her undergraduate research in permutation patterns.&lt;ref name="schafer"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.awm-math.org/schaferprize/1992.html|publisher=[[Association for Women in Mathematics]]|title=Third Annual Alice T. Schafer Prize|date=July 1992|accessdate=2016-02-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haimo"/&gt; In 2004 she became one of two inaugural winners of the Henry L.

Alder Award|publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]|accessdate=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011 Stankova won the [[Deborah and Franklin Haimo Awards for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics|Deborah and Franklin Tepper Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching]], given by the [[Mathematical Association of America]], "for her outstanding work in teaching, mentoring, and inspiring students at all levels, and in leading the development of Math Circles, and promoting participation in mathematics competitions".&lt;ref name="alumnews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haimo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abc7"&gt;{{citation|url=http://abc7news.com/archive/7981841/|first=Lyanne|last=Melendez|date=February 25, 2011|title=Mills College professor wins highest math award|publisher=ABC7 News}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
From 2009 to 2012 she was the Frederick A. Rice Professor of Mathematics at Mills.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mills.edu/academics/faculty/math/stankova/ZStankova_cv.pdf|title=Curriculum vitae: Zvezdelina Stankova|accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
