'''100 Pine Center''' is a [[Office#Grading|class-A office building]] at the northwest corner of Pine Street and Front Street in [[Financial District (San Francisco)|San Francisco's Financial District]].&lt;ref name=unico/&gt; The building is {{convert|145|m|abbr=on}} with 33 floors, and {{convert|402500|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on}} of rentable office space, a 150-car garage including 30 valet parking spaces.&lt;ref name=unico&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicoprop.com/properties/100_pine.html |publisher=Unico |title=100 Pine |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020154936/http://www.unicoprop.com/properties/100_pine.html |archivedate=October 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=walton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waltonst.com/Our%20Funds/Fund%20I/100%20Pine%20Street.aspx |title=100 Pine Street |publisher=Walton St. Capital |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113135609/http://www.waltonst.com/Our%20Funds/Fund%20I/100%20Pine%20Street.aspx |archivedate=January 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Completed in 1972 as headquarters of the Continental Insurance Company, the building is among the earlier of San Francisco's modern skyscrapers.

==Tenants==
The tower houses many daytime office workers. Major tenants include the [[New York Life Insurance Company]]. As of 2016, it is tied with [[45 Fremont Center]] as the twenty-sixth tallest building in San Francisco. It was certified as being operated and maintained as a green building under the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Existing Buildings (LEED EB 2.0) standards in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Green Building Council LEED Project List|url=http://www.usgbc.org/LEED/Project/CertifiedProjectList.aspx|access-date=2008-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103030148/http://www.usgbc.org/LEED/Project/CertifiedProjectList.aspx|archive-date=2008-11-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AIM Fight''' was a program designed to compare the popularity of two [[AOL Instant Messenger]] (AIM) screen names. AIM Fight was not an official AOL product.&lt;ref&gt;http://aolanswers.com/questions/aim_friendfight_privacy_abuse_518719343858116&lt;/ref&gt;

To "fight," two screen names are entered into the Web page and then each screen name was run through an [[algorithm]] that runs through the buddy lists of everybody signed on at that particular moment. The algorithm returns a score that represents the sum of the number of people who have those screen names listed as a buddy out to the third degree. As explained on [http://www.aimfight.com the AIM Fight Web page], the score cannot increase by adding people to that user's buddy list, but rather having other people add the user to their buddy list. Depending on how well-connected these people are, the increase in the score can vary.

Although the score represents a numerical sum of the people who have that screen name listed as a buddy and are currently signed on, the [http://www.aimfight.com/whatisaimfight.html help page] later states that the actual score was relative to how many people are connected to AIM. Although the term rank usually assumes that each person has a unique position, multiple users can share the same AIM Fight rank, including rank 1.

==Web API==

The API consists of a single [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] called by the [[Adobe Flash]] applet that returns the scores and ranks of the users. Additionally, it returns heights for the bars for the applet to show.

It was accessed at &lt;code&gt;http://www.aimfight.com/getFight.php?name1=SCREENNAME1&amp;name2=SCREENNAME2&lt;/code&gt;

By replacing &lt;code&gt;SCREENNAME1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SCREENNAME2&lt;/code&gt; with the screen names of the individuals to fight, [[percent-encoding|percent-encoded]] data was returned in the following format:

&lt;code&gt;&amp;success=1&amp;score1=132451&amp;score2=6004&amp;oscore1=27241&amp;oscore2=0&amp;height1=99&amp;height2=4&lt;/code&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;success&lt;/code&gt; returns whether or not the fight was a valid one (0 if no, 1 if yes)
* &lt;code&gt;score1&lt;/code&gt; represents the score of the first screen name entered
* &lt;code&gt;score2&lt;/code&gt; represents the score of the second screen name entered
* &lt;code&gt;oscore1&lt;/code&gt; shows the rank of the first screen name if it is in the Top 5%
* &lt;code&gt;oscore2&lt;/code&gt; shows the rank of the second screen name if it is in the Top 5%
* &lt;code&gt;height1&lt;/code&gt; is the height of the first screen name's bar
* &lt;code&gt;height2&lt;/code&gt; is the height of the second screen name's bar

'''Aquatic timing systems''' are designed to automate the process of timing, [[judging]], and [[Score (sport)|scoring]] in competitive [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] and other [[aquatic sports]], including [[diving (sport)|diving]], [[water polo]], and [[synchronised swimming]]. These systems are also used in the [[training]] of athletes, and many add-on products have been developed to assist with the training process.

==Manufacturers==
Companies that currently manufacture aquatic timing and systems include [http://www.stramatel.com/ Stramatel], [https://alge-timing.com ALGE-TIMING], [http://www.superiorswimtiming.com Superior Swim Timing], [http://www.wylas-timing.com Wylas Timing], [[Colorado Time Systems]], [[Seiko]], [[Daktronics]], [[Quince electronics]] and [[Omega SA|Omega/Swiss Timing]].

==History==
Prior to the 1950s, competitive swimmers relied on the sound of a starting pistol to start their [[racing|races]] and [[Mechanical watch|mechanical]] [[stopwatch]]es to record their times at the end of a race.  Unfortunately, these [[analog clock|analog]] watches could not record times accurately beyond one [[0.1|tenth]] (0.1) of a second.  The invention of automatic timing systems brought more accuracy and credibility to aquatic sports.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3667">The '''Building Information Modelling ([[Building information modeling|BIM]]) Task Group''' is a [[UK Government]]-funded group, managed through the [[Cabinet Office]], created in 2011 (and holding its first meeting in May 2011) and chaired by [[Mark Bew]]. It was founded to "drive adoption of BIM across government" in support of the ''Government Construction Strategy''.&lt;ref name=GCS&gt;Cabinet Office (2011) ''[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61152/Government-Construction-Strategy_0.pdf Government Construction Strategy]''. Accessed: 2 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed to strengthen the public sector’s capabilities in BIM implementation to that all central government departments can adopt, as a minimum, collaborative 'Level 2' BIM by 2016.

The core BIM task force, to which companies seconded employees, identified four work streams, each led by a core team member: stakeholder and media engagement, delivery and productivity, commercial and legal, and training and academia.&lt;ref&gt;BIM Task Group, ''[http://www.bimtaskgroup.org/work-streams-wps/ Work streams and work packages]''. Accessed 2 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Working parties were established to focus on particular areas including: training and education, [[COBie]] data set requirements, Plan of Works, software vendors (the BIM Technologies Alliance), contractors ([[UK Contractors Group]], now superseded by [[Build UK]]), and materials and products suppliers ([[Construction Products Association]]).&lt;ref&gt;BIM Task Group, ''[http://www.bimtaskgroup.org/working-parties/ Working Parties]''. Accessed 2 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, it was announced that the BIM Task Group would be wound down during 2015, with a "managed handover" during 2015 to a newly created "legacy group", though there was speculation that the group's life might be extended to help achieve a new BIM Level 3 target.&lt;ref name=Withers&gt;{{cite news|last1=Withers|first1=Ian|title=Concern over plans to wind down BIM Task Group|url=http://www.building.co.uk/concern-over-plans-to-wind-down-bim-task-group/5068515.article|accessdate=2 September 2014|work=Building|publisher=UBM|date=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarkson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clarkson|first1=Graham|title=Are we ready to manage without the BIM Task Group?|url=http://www.construction-manager.co.uk/comment/are-we-ready-manage-without-bim-task-group/|accessdate=2 September 2014|work=Construction Manager|publisher=Atom Publishing|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, an updated BIM Task Group delivering the February 2015 ''Digital Built Britain'' strategy was announced at the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] BIM 2016 Conference in a keynote speech by Mark Bew.&lt;ref&gt;Innovate UK, ''[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/launch-of-digital-built-britain Launch of Digital Built Britain]''.

'''Biofiltration''' is a [[pollution control]] technique using a [[bioreactor]] containing living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants.  Common uses include processing [[waste water]], capturing harmful chemicals or silt from [[surface runoff]], and [[Microbiology|microbiotic]] [[oxidation]] of contaminants in air.

==Examples of biofiltration==
Examples of biofiltration include:
* [[Bioswale]]s, [[biostrip]]s, [[biobags]], bioscrubbers, [[Vermifilter]]s and [[trickling filter]]s
* [[Constructed wetland]]s and [[Wetlands|natural wetlands]]
* [[Slow sand filter]]s
* [[Waste stabilization pond|Treatment pond]]s
* [[Green belt]]s
* [[Green wall]]s
* [[Riparian zone]]s, [[riparian forest]]s, [[bosque]]s

==Control of air pollution==
When applied to air filtration and purification, biofilters use microorganisms to remove [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Joseph S. Devinny, Marc A. Deshusses and Todd S. Webster|title=Biofiltration for Air Pollution Control|edition= |publisher=Lewis Publishers|year=1999|isbn=978-1-56670-289-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The air flows through a packed bed and the pollutant transfers into a thin [[biofilm]] on the surface of the packing material. [[Microorganism]]s, including [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] are immobilized in the biofilm and degrade the pollutant. Trickling filters and bioscrubbers rely on a biofilm and the bacterial action in their recirculating waters.

The technology finds greatest application in treating malodorous compounds and water-soluble [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs). Industries employing the technology include food and animal products, off-gas from [[wastewater]] treatment facilities, [[pharmaceutical]]s, wood products manufacturing, [[paint]] and coatings application and manufacturing and resin manufacturing and application, etc. Compounds treated are typically mixed VOCs and various [[sulfur]] compounds, including [[hydrogen sulfide]]. Very large airflows may be treated and although a large area (footprint) has typically been required—a large biofilter (&gt;200,000 [[acfm]]) may occupy as much or more land than a football field—this has been one of the principal drawbacks of the technology. Engineered biofilters, designed and built since the early 1990s, have provided significant footprint reductions over the conventional flat-bed, organic media type.

One of the main challenges to optimum biofilter operation is maintaining proper moisture throughout the system. The air is normally humidified before it enters the bed with a watering (spray) system, humidification chamber, bioscrubber, or biotrickling filter. Properly maintained, a natural, organic packing media like peat, vegetable mulch, bark or wood chips may last for several years but engineered, combined natural organic and synthetic component packing materials will generally last much longer, up to 10 years. A number of companies offer these types or proprietary packing materials and multi-year guarantees, not usually provided with a conventional compost or wood chip bed biofilter.

Although widely employed, the scientific community is still unsure of the physical phenomena underpinning biofilter operation, and information about the microorganisms involved continues to be developed. A biofilter/bio-oxidation system is a fairly simple device to construct and operate and offers a cost-effective solution provided the pollutant is biodegradable within a moderate time frame (increasing residence time = increased size and capital costs), at reasonable concentrations (and lb/hr loading rates) and that the airstream is at an organism-viable temperature.  For large volumes of air, a biofilter may be the only cost-effective solution. There is no secondary pollution (unlike the case of [[incineration]] where additional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; are produced from burning fuels) and degradation products form additional biomass, carbon dioxide and water. Media irrigation water, although many systems recycle part of it to reduce operating costs, has a moderately high [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) and may require treatment before disposal. However, this "blowdown water", necessary for proper maintenance of any bio-oxidation system, is generally accepted by municipal [[publicly owned treatment works]] without any pretreatment.

Biofilters are being utilized in [[Columbia Falls, Montana]] at Plum Creek Timber Company's [[fiberboard]] plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Keriann|title='Bug farm' a breath of fresh air|work=Spokesman Review|date=2008-10-26|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/oct/26/bug-farm-a-breath-of-fresh-air}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biofilters decrease the pollution emitted by the manufacturing process and the exhaust emitted is 98% clean. The newest, and largest, biofilter addition to Plum Creek cost $9.5 million, yet even though this new technology is expensive, in the long run it will cost less overtime than the alternative exhaust-cleaning incinerators fueled by natural gas (which are not as environmentally friendly).  The biofilters use trillions of microscopic bacteria that cleanse the air being released from the plant.

==Water treatment==
[[Image:Trickle Filter.svg|thumb|right|A typical complete trickling filter system for treating wastewaters.&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R. |title=Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants| edition=1st| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year=1967|lccn=67019834 |title-link=Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:Trickle Filter Cross-section.png|thumb|right|Image 1: A schematic cross-section of the contact face of the bed media in a trickling filter.]]

Biofiltration was first introduced in England in 1893 as a trickling filter for wastewater treatment and has since been successfully used for the treatment of different types of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=D.S. Chaudhary, S. Vigneswara, H.-H. Ngo, W.G. Shim and H. Moon|title=Biofilter in water and wastewater treatment|edition= |publisher=The Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering Vol.20 No.6|year=2003|url=http://josiah.berkeley.edu/Papers/biofilterReview2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological treatment has been used in Europe to filter surface water for drinking purposes since the early 1900s and is now receiving more interest worldwide. Biofiltration is also common in [[wastewater treatment]], [[aquaculture]] and [[greywater]] recycling, as a way to minimize water replacement while increasing [[water quality]].

===Biofiltration process===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:biofilter.jpg|thumb|right|Biofilter installation at a commercial composting facility.]] --&gt;
A biofilter is a bed of media on which microorganisms attach and grow to form a biological layer called [[biofilm]]. Biofiltration is thus usually referred to as a fixed–film process. Generally, the biofilm is formed by a community of different microorganisms ([[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[yeast]], etc.), macro-organisms ([[protozoa]], worms, insect’s larvae, etc.) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Flemming and Wingender, 2010). The aspect of the [[biofilm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H.C. Flemming  |author2=J. Wingender |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The biofilm matrix|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=623–633 |edition= |year=2010|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2415 |pmid=20676145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is usually slimy and muddy.

Water to be treated can be applied intermittently or continuously over the media, via upflow or downflow. Typically, a biofilter has two or three phases, depending on the feeding strategy (percolating or submerged biofilter):

* a solid phase (media);
* a liquid phase (water);
* a gaseous phase (air).

Organic matter and other water components diffuse into the biofilm where the treatment occurs, mostly by [[biodegradation]]. Biofiltration processes are usually [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic]], which means that microorganisms require oxygen for their metabolism. Oxygen can be supplied to the biofilm, either concurrently or countercurrently with water flow. Aeration occurs passively by the natural flow of air through the process (three phase biofilter) or by forced air supplied by blowers.

Microorganisms' activity is a key-factor of the process performance. The main influencing factors are the water composition, the biofilter hydraulic loading, the type of media, the feeding strategy (percolation or submerged media), the age of the biofilm, temperature, aeration, etc.

===Types of filtering media===

Most biofilters use media such as sand, crushed rock, river gravel, or some form of plastic or ceramic material shaped as small beads and rings. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cals.arizona.edu/azaqua/ista/ISTA7/RecircWorkshop/Workshop%20PP%20%20&amp;%20Misc%20Papers%20Adobe%202006/7%20Biofiltration/Nitrification-Biofiltration/Biofiltration-Nitrification%20Design%20Overview.pdf|title=Biofiltration-Nitrification Design Overview|last=Ebeling|first=James|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===

Although biological filters have simple superficial structures, their internal hydrodynamics and the microorganisms' biology and ecology are complex and variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.R. Curds  |author2=H.A. Hawkes |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Ecological Aspects of Used-Water Treatment|edition= |publisher=The Processes and their Ecology Vol.3|year=1983|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D0FRAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780121995027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics confer robustness to the process. In other words, the process has the capacity to maintain its performance or rapidly return to initial levels following a period of no flow, of intense use, toxic shocks, media backwash (high rate biofiltration processes), etc.

The structure of the biofilm protects microorganisms from difficult environmental conditions and retains the biomass inside the process, even when conditions are not optimal for its growth. Biofiltration processes offer the following advantages: (Rittmann et al., 1988):

* Because microorganisms are retained within the biofilm, biofiltration allows the development of microorganisms with relatively low specific growth rates;
* Biofilters are less subject to variable or intermittent loading and to [[Water hammer|hydraulic shock]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=P.W. Westerman |author2=J.R. Bicudo |author3=A. Kantardjieff |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Aerobic fixed-media biofilter treatment of flushed swine manure|edition= |publisher=ASAE Annual International Meeting - Florida|year=1998|url=http://eurekamag.com/research/003/032/aerobic-fixed-media-biofilter-cure-flushed-pig-manure.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Operational costs are usually lower than for [[activated sludge]]; 
* Final treatment result is less influenced by biomass separation since the biomass concentration at the effluent is much lower than for suspended biomass processes;
* Attached biomass becomes more specialized (higher concentration of relevant organisms) at a given point in the process train because there is no [[biomass return]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H. Odegaard|title=Innovations in wastewater treatment: the moving bed biofilm process|edition= |publisher=Water Science Technology|year=2006|url=http://www.iwaponline.com/wst/05309/wst053090017.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawbacks===

Because filtration and growth of biomass leads to an accumulation of matter in the filtering media, this type of fixed-film process is subject to [[bioclogging]] and flow channeling. Depending on the type of application and on the media used for microbial growth, bioclogging can be controlled using physical and/or chemical methods. Whenever possible, backwash steps can be implemented using air and/or water to disrupt the biomat and recover flow. Chemicals such as oxidizing ([[peroxide]], [[ozone]]) or biocide agents can also be used.

==Drinking water==
For drinking water, biological water treatment involves the use of naturally occurring microorganisms in the surface water to improve water quality. Under optimum conditions, including relatively low turbidity and high oxygen content, the organisms break down material in the water and thus improve water quality. Slow sand filters or carbon filters are used to provide a support on which these microorganisms grow. These biological treatment systems effectively reduce water-borne diseases, dissolved organic carbon, turbidity and color in surface water, thus improving overall water quality.

==Wastewater==
Biofiltration is used to treat wastewater from a wide range of sources, with varying organic compositions and concentrations. Many examples of biofiltration applications are described in the literature. Bespoke biofilters have been developed and commercialized for the [[agricultural wastewater treatment|treatment of animal wastes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G. Buelna, R. Dubé  |author2=N. Turgeon |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Pig manure treatment by organic bed biofiltration|journal=Desalination |volume=231 |pages=297–304 |edition= |year=2008|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011916408003731|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2007.11.049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[landfill]] [[leachate]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=M.

This process is versatile as it can be adapted to small flows (&lt; 1 m3/d), such as onsite [[sewage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=P. Talbot, G. Bélanger, M. Pelletier, G. Laliberté and Y.

Lacasse|title=Effectiveness of domestic wastewater treatment technologies in the context of the new constrains imposed by lifestyle changes in north American families|edition= |publisher=NOWRA - 18th Annual Technical Education Conference and Expo in Milwaukee|year=2009|url=http://www.premiertechaqua.com/fr/telechargez/fichiers/00%20Articles%20scientifiques/90%20NOWRApaperR.Lacasse_FR_21052009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, a biofilter located after a septic tank constitutes a robust process able to sustain the variability observed without compromising the treatment performance.

==Use in aquaculture==
The use of biofilters is common in closed [[aquaculture]] systems, such as [[recirculating aquaculture systems]] (RAS).  Many designs are used, with different benefits and drawbacks, however the function is the same: reducing water exchanges by converting [[ammonia]] to [[nitrate]].  Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) originates from the brachial [[excretion]] from the [[gill]]s of [[aquatic animal]]s and from the [[decomposition]] of organic matter.  As ammonia-N is highly toxic, this is converted to a less toxic form of nitrite (by ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' sp.) and then to an even less toxic form of nitrate (by ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' sp.).  This "nitrification" process requires oxygen (aerobic conditions), without which the biofilter can crash.  Furthermore, as this nitrification cycle produces H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the pH can decrease which necessitates the use of buffers such as [[Lime (material)|lime]].

'''collectSPACE''' is an [[Internet|online]] publication and community for [[outer space|space]] history enthusiasts featuring articles and photos about space artifacts and memorabilia, information on past, current, and upcoming space events, space history collecting resources, and links to other space-related websites. It also provides an array of [[message board]]s where registered members can discuss various aspects of space history and the space collecting hobby; buy, sell, or trade items; or pose "what if?" historical questions. Users often abbreviate the website's name as "cS," and members often refer to each other as "cSers."

collectSPACE, founded and edited by [[Robert Pearlman]], has published articles and reviews by authors [[Andrew Chaikin]] (''[[A Man on the Moon]]''), Kris Stoever (''For Spacious Skies''), [[James Oberg]] (''Red Star in Orbit''), Frederick Ordway III (''Imagining Space''), [[Francis French]] (''[[In the Shadow of the Moon (book)|In the Shadow of the Moon]]''), [[David Hitt (author)|David Hitt]] (''Homesteading Space''), Russell Still (''Relics of the Space Race''), [[Colin Burgess (author)|Colin Burgess]] (''[[Into That Silent Sea]]''), Jay Gallentine (''Ambassadors From Earth'') and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronaut [[Walt Cunningham]], among others.

==History==

The website's intended name was spacememorabilia.com, for which a logo had been designed; however, the [[URL]] was owned (though not in use) by former [[Gemini program|Gemini]] and Apollo astronaut [[Pete Conrad]]. Pearlman instead bought the URL collectSPACE.com, which came online on July 20, 1999, the 30th anniversary of the [[Apollo 11|Apollo 11 moon landing]] (Conrad died unexpectedly July 8).

collectSpace originally contained a photo gallery, drawing on Pearlman's personal collection; "Sightings," a calendar of astronaut appearances; and a short article about Apollo 11 anniversary toys. "Sightings" was chosen to show up in Internet searches for ''[[Sightings]]'', a TV series about [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s. The site's original tagline was "memorabilia from the conquest of the final frontier," which became "The Source for Space History &amp; Artifacts."

collectSPACE earned national media attention later in 1999 for its role in halting a controversial [[eBay]] auction for [[space shuttle Challenger|space shuttle ''Challenger'']] debris. In September 1999, it first covered a space memorabilia auction&amp;mdash;[[Christie's]] East&amp;mdash;followed by Superior Galleries of [[Beverly Hills, California]] the following month. collectSPACE was the first to webcast space memorabilia auctions, providing live audio (and one year, video) from Superior Gallery's auction floor, as well as live hammer results (auction houses subsequently added their own webcast capabilities or partnered with [[eBay]] for live online bidding).

The site's message board went online in November 1999. Among those posting and replying to messages have been former Apollo ([[Flight controller#Electrical, Environmental and Consumables Manager (EECOM)|EECOM flight controller]]) [[Sy Liebergot]]; Stephen Clemmons, a member of the [[Apollo 1]] ground support crew; [[Project Mercury]] astronaut [[Scott Carpenter]]'s daughter Kris Stoever; astronaut Pete Conrad's son, Pete Conrad, III; [[National Air and Space Museum]] curator Allan Needell, space historian [[Dwayne A. Day]], ''Who's Who in Space'' authors Michael Cassutt and Rex Hall, Kraig McNutt of "Today In Space History," and [[The Surfaris]]' former bassist Andrew Lagomarsino, among others. A number of astronauts are known to be cS readers.

collectSPACE was nominated for ''[[The Houston Chronicle]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s best [[blog]] in its Ultimate Houston Readers Pick for 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://www.bloghouston.net/item/1473/catid/3 | title = Chron to imitate Houston Press "Best Of" issue (badly) | publisher = blogHouston.net | author =  | date = 2009-07-23 | accessdate = 2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, collectSPACE was the first to reveal the name of NASA's next planned manned spacecraft, [[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion]], and publish its logo;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2006/07/23/1382.aspx | title = The Orion Era? | publisher = [[MSNBC]] | author =  | date =  | accessdate = 2009-12-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091207092416/http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2006/07/23/1382.aspx | archivedate = 2009-12-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the name [[Altair (spacecraft)|Altair]] for the next planned lunar lander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.abcnews.com/scienceandsociety/2007/12/houston-tranqui.html | title = 'Tranquility Base Here, the Altair has Landed' | publisher = [[ABC News]] | author = Potter, Ned  | date = 2007-12-13 | accessdate = 2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable auctions==

In the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9-11 terrorist attacks]], collectSPACE organized ''Heroes Helping Heroes'', an online auction benefiting the [[American Red Cross]]. In partnership with [[Yahoo!]] Auctions, the site offered bidders the chance to have an item of their choice signed by one of 22 retired astronauts, who volunteered to participate. $12,686 was raised.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Alan. “Space Heroes Join Charity Auction.” MSNBC. 5 Oct. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2003 and 2006, collectSPACE hosted annual silent auctions benefiting the [[Astronaut Scholarship Foundation]]. The astronaut experiences and artifacts auctions have raised more than $180,000 for exceptional college students seeking degrees in [[science]] and [[engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://astronautscholarship.org/auctions.html | title = ASF Auctions | publisher = Astronaut Scholarship Foundation | author =  | date =  | accessdate = 2009-12-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091210104209/http://astronautscholarship.org/auctions.html | archivedate = 2009-12-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Decay heat''' is the [[heat]] released as a result of [[radioactive decay]]. This heat is produced as an effect of radiation on materials: the energy of the [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[Beta particle|beta]] or [[gamma radiation]] is converted into the thermal movement of atoms.

Decay heat occurs naturally from decay of long-lived radioisotopes that are primordially present from the Earth's formation.

In nuclear reactor engineering, decay heat continues to be generated after the reactor has been shut down (see [[SCRAM]]), and [[Nuclear chain reaction|nuclear chain reactions]] have been suspended. The decay of the short-lived radioisotopes created in fission continues at high power, for a time after [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shut down]]. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mragheb.com/NPRE%20457%20CSE%20462%20Safety%20Analysis%20of%20Nuclear%20Reactor%20Systems/Decay%20Heat%20generation%20in%20Fission%20Reactors.pdf|title=Decay heat generation in fission reactors|last=Ragheb|first=Magdi|date=15 Oct 2014|website=|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major source of heat production in a newly shut down reactor is due to the [[beta decay]] of new radioactive elements recently produced from fission fragments in the fission process.

Quantitatively, at the moment of reactor shutdown, decay heat from these radioactive sources is still 6.5% of the previous core power, if the reactor has had a long and steady [[power history]]. About 1 hour after shutdown, the decay heat will be about 1.5% of the previous core power. After a day, the decay heat falls to 0.4%, and after a week it will be only 0.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anl.gov/sites/anl.gov/files/spent_fuel_nutt.pdf |title=Spent Fuel |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory |date=April 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because radioisotopes of all half life lengths are present in [[nuclear waste]], enough decay heat continues to be produced in spent fuel rods to require them to spend a minimum of one year, and more typically 10 to 20 years, in a [[spent fuel pool]] of water, before being further processed. However, the heat produced during this time is still only a small fraction (less than 10%) of the heat produced in the first week after shutdown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

If no cooling system is working to remove the decay heat from a crippled and newly shut down reactor, the decay heat may cause the core of the reactor to reach unsafe temperatures within a few hours or days, depending upon the type of core. These extreme temperatures can lead to minor fuel damage (e.g. a few fuel particle failures (0.1 to 0.5%) in a graphite moderated gas-cooled design&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/inisnkm/nkm/aws/htgr/abstracts/abst_29009817.html IAEA TECDOC 978: Fuel performance and fission product behaviour in gas cooled reactors]&lt;/ref&gt;) or even major core structural damage ([[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]]) in a light water reactor &lt;ref&gt;[[Three Mile Island accident]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]&lt;/ref&gt; or liquid metal fast reactor. Chemical species released from the damaged core material may lead to further explosive reactions (steam or hydrogen) which may further damage the reactor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub913e_web.pdf The Chernobyl Accident]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Natural occurrence==
Naturally occurring decay heat is a significant source of the heat in the interior of the [[Earth]].  Radioactive isotopes of [[uranium]], [[thorium]] and [[potassium]] are the primary contributors to this decay heat, and this [[radioactive decay]] is the primary source of heat from which [[geothermal energy]] derives.&lt;ref name=ucsusa&gt;http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/renewable-energy/how-geothermal-energy-works.html How Geothermal energy works&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power reactors in shutdown==
[[Image:Decay heat illustration2.PNG|thumb|Decay heat as fraction of full power for a reactor [[SCRAM]]ed from full power at time 0, using two different correlations]]
In a typical [[nuclear fission]] reaction, 187 [[MeV]] of energy are released instantaneously in the form of [[kinetic energy]] from the fission products, kinetic energy from the fission neutrons, instantaneous [[gamma rays]], or gamma rays from the capture of neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hss.doe.gov/nuclearsafety/ns/techstds/standard/hdbk1019/h1019v1.pdf#page=85.5 DOE fundamentals handbook - Nuclear physics and reactor theory] - volume 1 of 2, module 1, page 61&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 23 MeV of energy are released at some time after fission from the [[beta decay]] of [[fission product]]s.  About 10 MeV of the energy released from the [[beta decay]] of [[fission products]] is in the form of [[neutrinos]], and since neutrinos are very weakly interacting, this 10 MeV of energy will not be deposited in the reactor core.  This results in 13 MeV (6.5% of the total fission energy) being deposited in the reactor core from delayed beta decay of fission products, at some time after any given fission reaction has occurred. In a steady state, this heat from delayed fission product beta decay contributes 6.5% of the normal reactor heat output.

When a nuclear reactor has been [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shut down]], and nuclear fission is not occurring at a large scale, the major source of heat production will be due to the delayed [[beta decay]] of these fission products (which originated as fission fragments).  For this reason, at the moment of reactor shutdown, decay heat will be about 6.5% of the previous core power if the reactor has had a long and steady [[power history]].  About 1 hour after shutdown, the decay heat will be about 1.5% of the previous core power. After a day, the decay heat falls to 0.4%, and after a week it will be only 0.2%. The decay heat production rate will continue to slowly decrease over time; the decay curve depends upon the proportions of the various fission products in the core and upon their respective [[half-lives]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=yugQKddO82IC&amp;pg=PA680&amp;dq=neutron+startup+source&amp;num=50&amp;cd=52#v=onepage&amp;q=neutron%20startup%20source&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; An approximation for the decay heat curve valid from 10 seconds to 100 days after shutdown is
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{P_0} = 0.066 \left( \left( \tau - \tau_s \right)^{-0.2} - \tau^{-0.2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the decay power, &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; is the reactor power before shutdown, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the time since reactor startup and &lt;math&gt;\tau_s&lt;/math&gt; is the time of reactor shutdown measured from the time of startup (in seconds).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuceng.ca/papers/decayhe1b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  For an approach with a more direct physical basis, some models use the fundamental concept of [[radioactive decay]].  Used nuclear fuel contains a large number of different isotopes that contribute to decay heat, which are all subject to the radioactive decay law, so some models consider decay heat to be a sum of exponential functions with different decay constants and initial contribution to the heat rate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exitech.com/models/core_neutronics.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  A more accurate model would consider the effects of precursors, since many isotopes follow several steps in their radioactive [[decay chain]], and the decay of daughter products will have a greater effect longer after shutdown.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{P_0} = \sum_{i=1}^{11}P_i e^{-\lambda t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The removal of the decay heat is a significant reactor safety concern, especially shortly after normal shutdown or following a [[loss-of-coolant accident]].  Failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused [[nuclear accidents]], including the nuclear accidents at [[Three Mile Island]] and [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima I]].  The heat removal is usually achieved through several redundant and diverse systems, from which heat is removed via heat exchangers. Water is passed through the secondary side of the heat exchanger via the [[Nuclear safety systems#Essential service water system|essential service water system]]&lt;ref name=pcsr-09-06-29&gt;[http://www.epr-reactor.co.uk/ssmod/liblocal/docs/PCSR/Chapter%20%209%20-%20Auxiliary%20Systems/Sub-Chapter%209.2%20-%20Water%20Systems.pdf Pre-construction safety report - Sub-chapter 9.2 – Water Systems] AREVA NP / EDF, published 2009-06-29, accessed 2011-03-23&lt;/ref&gt; which dissipates the heat into the 'ultimate heat sink', often a sea, river or large lake. In locations without a suitable body of water, the heat is dissipated into the air by recirculating the water via a [[cooling tower]]. The failure of ESWS circulating pumps was one of the factors that endangered safety during the [[1999 Blayais Nuclear Power Plant flood]].

== Spent fuel ==
After one year, typical [[spent nuclear fuel]] generates about 10 [[kW]] of decay heat per [[tonne]], decreasing to about 1&amp;nbsp;kW/t after ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/education/phys.htm world-nuclear.org] - Some physics of uranium&lt;/ref&gt; Hence effective active or passive cooling for spent nuclear fuel is required for a number of years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4171">'''Delay composition''', also called '''delay charge''' or '''delay train''', is a [[pyrotechnic composition]], a sort of [[pyrotechnic initiator]], a mixture of [[oxidizer]] and [[fuel]] that burns in a slow, constant rate that should not be significantly dependent on temperature and pressure. Delay compositions are used to introduce a &lt;!-- cough --&gt; delay into the [[firing train]], e.g. to properly sequence firing of [[fireworks]], to delay firing of [[ejection charge]]s in e.g. model rockets, or to introduce a few seconds of time between triggering a [[hand grenade]] and its [[explosion]]. Typical delay times range between several milliseconds and several seconds.

A popular delay charge is a tube of pressed [[black powder]]. The mechanical assembly prevents the outright detonation of the charge.

While delay compositions are principally similar to other fuel-oxidizer compositions, larger grain sizes and less aggressively reacting chemicals are used. Many of the compositions generate little or no gas during burning. Typical materials used are:
* '''Fuels''': [[silicon]], [[boron]], [[manganese]], [[tungsten]], [[antimony]], [[antimony trisulfide]], [[zirconium]], [[zirconium]]&amp;ndash;[[nickel]] alloy, [[zinc]], [[magnesium]], etc.
* '''Oxidizers''': [[lead dioxide]], [[iron oxide]]s, [[barium chromate]], [[lead chromate]], [[tin(IV) oxide]], [[bismuth(III) oxide]], [[barium sulfate]] (for high-temperature compositions), [[potassium perchlorate]] (usually used in small amount together with other oxidizers), etc.
* '''Additives''' to cool down the flame and slow down the reaction can be employed; inert materials or coolants like [[titanium dioxide]], ground glass, [[chalk]], [[sodium bicarbonate]], etc. are common.

The burn rates are dependent on: [http://www.allbusiness.com/north-america/canada/689991-1.html]
* nature of fuel - fuels that release more heat burn faster
* nature of oxidizer - oxidizers that require less heat to decompose burn faster
* the composition ratio - stoichiometric mixtures burn the fastest, also slight excess of metallic fuel also increases burn rate, probably due to heat transfer
* particle sizes - smaller particles burn faster, but too small particles may lead to incomplete or interrupted burn due to too narrow heating zone
* mechanical assembly and housing - charge diameter and thermal conductivity of housing influence lateral heat losses
* ambient temperature - ideally this dependence is very low but extremely low or extremely high temperatures may have influence

Examples of some compositions are: [http://www.freepyroinfo.com/Pyrotechnic/pyro_html/Explosives.htm]
* [[black powder]] with addition of inert material, e.g. [[chalk]] or [[sodium bicarbonate]]
* [[lead(II) oxide]] with [[silicon]], burning at 1.5–2&amp;nbsp;cm/s
* [[red lead]] with silicon, burning at intermediate rate
* [[lead(IV) oxide]] with silicon, burning at 5–6&amp;nbsp;cm/s
* [[potassium permanganate]] with [[antimony]], very slow
* Manganese Delay Composition: [[manganese]] with [[lead chromate]] and [[barium chromate]] (lead chromate is the principal oxidizer, barium chromate acts as burning rate modifier, the more of it the slower the reaction) [http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200109/000020010901A0317367.php]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islandgroup.com/military/pyrotechnic_chemistry.php |title=PYROTECHNIC CHEMISTRY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13538">'''Design for additive manufacturing''' ('''DfAM''' or '''DFAM''') is [[design for manufacturability]] as applied to [[3D printing|additive manufacturing]] (AM). It is a general type of design methods or tools whereby functional performance and/or other key product life-cycle considerations such as manufacturability, reliability, and cost can be optimized subjected to the capabilities of additive manufacturing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=Yunlong|date=2016|title=A survey of the design methods for additive manufacturing to improve functional performance|journal=Rapid Prototyping Journal|volume=22|issue=3|pages=569–590|pmid=|doi=10.1108/RPJ-01-2015-0011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept emerges due to the enormous design freedom provided by AM technologies. To take full advantages of unique capabilities from AM processes, DFAM methods or tools are needed. Typical DFAM methods or tools includes [[topology optimization]], design for multiscale structures (lattice or cellular structures), multi-material design, [[mass customization]], part consolidation, and other design methods which can make use of AM-enabled features.

DFAM is not always separate from broader DFM, as the making of many objects can involve both additive and subtractive steps. Nonetheless, the name "DFAM" has value because it focuses attention on the way that [[commercialization|commercializing]] AM in production roles is not just a matter of figuring out how to switch existing parts from subtractive to additive. Rather, it is about redesigning entire objects (assemblies, subsystems) in view of the newfound availability of advanced AM. That is, it involves redesigning them because their entire earlier design—including even how, why, and at which places they were originally divided into discrete parts—was conceived within the constraints of a world where advanced AM did not yet exist. Thus instead of just modifying an existing part design to allow it to be made additively, full-fledged DFAM involves things like reimagining the overall object such that it has fewer parts or a new set of parts with substantially different boundaries and connections. The object thus may no longer be an assembly at all, or it may be an assembly with many fewer parts. Many examples of such deep-rooted practical impact of DFAM have been emerging in the 2010s, as AM greatly broadens its commercialization. For example, in 2017, [[GE Aviation]] revealed that it had used DFAM to create a helicopter engine with 16 parts instead of 900, with great potential impact on reducing the complexity of [[supply chain]]s.&lt;ref name="Zelinski_2017-03-31"&gt;{{Citation |last=Zelinski |first=Peter |date=2017-03-31 |title=GE team secretly printed a helicopter engine, replacing 900 parts with 16 |journal=Modern Machine Shop |url=http://www.additivemanufacturing.media/blog/post/ge-team-secretly-printed-a-helicopter-engine-replacing-900-parts-with-16 |doi= |access-date=2017-04-09 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this radical rethinking aspect that has led to themes such as that "DFAM requires 'enterprise-level disruption'."&lt;ref name="Hendrixson_2017-04-24"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hendrixson |first=Stephanie |date=2017-04-24 |title=How to think about design for additive manufacturing |journal=[[Modern Machine Shop]] |url=http://www.additivemanufacturing.media/blog/post/how-to-think-about-design-for-additive-manufacturing- |accessdate=2017-05-05 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the [[disruptive innovation]] that AM can allow can logically extend throughout the enterprise and its supply chain, not just change the layout on a machine shop floor.

DFAM involves both broad themes (which apply to many AM processes) and optimizations specific to a particular AM process. For example, [[DFM analysis for stereolithography]] maximizes DFAM for that modality.

== Background ==
Additive manufacturing is defined as a material joining process, whereby a product can be directly fabricated from its 3D model, usually layer upon layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.astm.org/Standards/F2792.htm|title=ASTM F2792 - 12a Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing Technologies, (Withdrawn 2015)|website=www.astm.org|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing to traditional manufacturing technologies such as CNC machining or casting, AM processes have several unique capabilities. It enables the fabrication of parts with a complex shape as well as complex material distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Additive Manufacturing Technologies|last=Gibson|first=Dr Ian|last2=Rosen|first2=Dr David W.|last3=Stucker|first3=Dr Brent|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781441911193|pages=299–332|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-1120-9_11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These unique capabilities significantly enlarge the design freedom for designers. However, they also bring a big challenge. Traditional [[Design for manufacturing]] (DFM) rules or guidelines deeply rooted in designers’ mind and severely restrict designers to further improve product functional performance by taking advantages of these unique capabilities brought by AM processes. Moreover, traditional feature-based [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] tools are also difficult to deal with irregular geometry for the improvement of functional performance. To solve these issues, design methods or tools are needed to help designers to take full advantages of design freedom provide by AM processes. These design methods or tools can be categorized as Design for Additive Manufacturing

== Methods ==

=== Topology optimization ===
[[Topology optimization]] is a type of structural optimization technique which can optimize material layout within a given design space. Compared to other typical structural optimization techniques, such as size optimization or shape optimization, topology optimization can update both shape and topology of a part. However, the complex optimized shapes obtained from topology optimization are always a headache for traditional manufacturing processes such as CNC machining. To solve this issue, additive manufacturing processes can be applied to fabricate topology optimization result. However, it should be noticed, some manufacturing constraints such as minimal feature size also need to be considered during the topology optimization process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leary|first=Martin|last2=Merli|first2=Luigi|last3=Torti|first3=Federico|last4=Mazur|first4=Maciej|last5=Brandt|first5=Milan|date=2014-11-01|title=Optimal topology for additive manufacture: A method for enabling additive manufacture of support-free optimal structures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261306914004646|journal=Materials &amp; Design|volume=63|pages=678–690|doi=10.1016/j.matdes.2014.06.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the topology optimization can help designers to get an optimal complex geometry for additive manufacturing, this technique can be considered one of DFAM methods.

=== Multiscale structure design ===
Due to the unique capabilities of AM processes, parts with multiscale complexities can be realized. This provides a great design freedom for designers to use cellular structures or lattice structures on micro or mesoscales for the preferred properties. For example, in the aerospace field, lattice structures fabricated by AM process can be used for weight reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=Yunlong|last2=Kurtz|first2=Aidan|last3=Zhao|first3=Yaoyao Fiona|date=2015-12-01|title=Bidirectional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (BESO) based design method for lattice structure to be fabricated by additive manufacturing|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448515000792|journal=Computer-Aided Design|volume=69|pages=91–101|doi=10.1016/j.cad.2015.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the bio-medical field, bio-implant made of lattice or cellular structures can enhance [[osseointegration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=M.|last2=Zaeh|first2=M.|last3=Graf|first3=T.|last4=Ostendorf|first4=A.|last5=Emmelmann|first5=C.|last6=Scheinemann|first6=P.|last7=Munsch|first7=M.|last8=Seyda|first8=V.|date=2011-01-01|title=Lasers in Manufacturing 2011 - Proceedings of the Sixth International WLT Conference on Lasers in ManufacturingLaser Additive Manufacturing of Modified Implant Surfaces with Osseointegrative Characteristics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875389211001271|journal=Physics Procedia|volume=12|pages=375–384|doi=10.1016/j.phpro.2011.03.048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi-material design ===
Parts with multi-material or complex material distribution can be achieved by additive manufacturing processes. To help designers to take use of this advantage, several design and simulation methods &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Zhang|first=Feng|last2=Zhou|first2=Chi|last3=Das|first3=Sonjoy|date=2015-08-02|pages=V01AT02A031|doi=10.1115/DETC2015-47772|title=Volume 1A: 35th Computers and Information in Engineering Conference|isbn=978-0-7918-5704-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhou|first=Shiwei|last2=Wang|first2=Michael Yu|date=2006-07-18|title=Multimaterial structural topology optimization with a generalized Cahn–Hilliard model of multiphase transition|journal=Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=89|doi=10.1007/s00158-006-0035-9|issn=1615-147X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanković|first=Tino|last2=Mueller|first2=Jochen|last3=Egan|first3=Paul|last4=Shea|first4=Kristina|date=2015-08-02|title=Optimization of Additively Manufactured Multi-Material Lattice Structures Using Generalized Optimality Criteria|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280734523}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed to support design a part with multiple materials or [[Functionally graded material|Functionally Graded Materials]] . These design methods also bring a challenge to traditional CAD system. Most of them can only deal with homogeneous materials now.

=== Design for mass customization ===
Since additive manufacturing can directly fabricate parts from products’ digital model, it significantly reduces the cost and leading time of producing customized products. Thus, how to rapidly generate customized parts becomes a central issue for mass customization. Several design methods &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mass Customization|last=Reeves|first=Phil|last2=Tuck|first2=Chris|last3=Hague|first3=Richard|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Springer London|isbn=9781849964883|editor-last=Fogliatto|editor-first=Flavio S.|series=Springer Series in Advanced Manufacturing|pages=275–289|language=en|editor-last2=Silveira|editor-first2=Giovani J. C. da|doi=10.1007/978-1-84996-489-0_13}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been proposed to help designers or users to obtain the customized product in an easy way. These methods or tools can also be considered as the DFAM methods.

=== Parts consolidation ===
Due to the constraints of traditional manufacturing methods, some complex components are usually separated into several parts for the ease of manufacturing as well as assembly. This situation has been changed by the using of additive manufacturing technologies. Some case studies have been done to shows some parts in the original design can be consolidated into one complex part and fabricated by additive manufacturing processes.  This redesigning process can be called as parts consolidation. The research shows parts consolidation will not only reduce part count, it can also improve the product functional performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Sheng|last2=Tang|first2=Yunlong|last3=Zhao|first3=Yaoyao Fiona|date=2015-10-01|title=A new part consolidation method to embrace the design freedom of additive manufacturing|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526612515000699|journal=Journal of Manufacturing Processes|series=Additive Manufacturing|volume=20, Part 3|pages=444–449|doi=10.1016/j.jmapro.2015.06.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design methods which can guide designers to do part consolidation can also be regarded as a type of DFAM methods.

=== Lattice structures ===
Lattice structures is type of cellular structures. Thanks to the free-form manufacturing capability of additive manufacturing technology, it is now possible to design complex forms. These structures were previously difficult to manufacture, hence not widely used.

[[Image:Kippentwicklungsdose.jpg|thumb|Developing Tank]]
A '''developing tank''' is a light-tight container used for [[Photographic processing|developing film]]. A developing tank allows [[photographic film]] to be developed in a daylight environment. This is necessary because most film is [[panchromatic]] and therefore can not be exposed to any light during processing. Depending upon the size and type, a developing tank can hold one to many roll or sheet films.
Famous brands include Paterson, Yankee, Jobo and Nikor.
[[Image:35mm ss filmreel.jpg|right|thumb|Stainless steel film reel for 35&amp;nbsp;mm film]]
A film reel holds roll films in a spiral shape. The film is held evenly spaced so that the chemicals in the developing tank reach all of the film.

==Types==
[[File:Minoxtank.jpg|thumb|Minox daylight developing tank]]
[[File:Meopta 16mm development tank.jpg|thumb|Meopta 16mm development tank]]
===General===
General tank support  110,126,135,120,620 format films
Developing tanks and film reels for roll films come in two varieties: plastic and stainless steel. With stainless steel reels, the film is clipped to the center and then gently pinched while the reel is turned so that the film falls into the reel's grooves. With a plastic reel, the film is loaded from the outside and then wound onto the reel by rotating the reel with a back-and-forth motion.
===Special purpose===
*Minox dayling development tank. Minox format film can be loaded in broad daylight without the use of a changing bag or darkroom.  
*Meopta 16mm development tank.  Used for 16mm film only.  Film must be loaded in darkroom.
*Agfa Rondinax 35 and 60. Respectively used for 135 and 120 film formats. Can be loaded in broad daylight without the use of a changing bag or darkroom.
==Use==
[[File:Jobo16reel.jpg|thumb|Jobo 16mm/110  dueset plastic reel]]
The user begins by opening the film canister (in the case of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film) or separating the film from a paper backing (in the case of medium format film, e.g. 120/220 format). The film is then loaded onto a film reel in a completely dark environment; this can be a light-tight room or a [[changing bag]]. Care must be taken during this step, as improperly loading the film may result in parts of the film not getting developed. Once the film is on the reel it is put into the developing tank, and then a lid is placed on the developing tank. Because the lid prevents light from reaching the film, the rest of the film developing process may be carried out in daylight. In addition to protecting the film from light, the lid contains an opening for rapidly pouring liquids into and out of the developing tank. Finally, a separate cap seals the canister, which prevents the contents of the tank from spilling when agitated by inverting the tank.But the tank should be cleaned by water every time after development as any residual fixer may not lead to proper development of the next film.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1852">'''Dexit''' was a publicly traded company in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. It offered a rechargeable, contactless, stored-value smart key tag used for electronic payment in on-line or off-line systems locally in 2003, until it stopped operating in 2006. Dexit was rebranded in 2007 and its name changed to [[Hosted Data Transaction Solutions Inc]] (HDX) and is currently now known as [[Posera]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/posera-hdx-rebrands-as-posera-and-changes-ticker-symbol-to-pay-on-the-toronto-stock-exchange-tsx-2015-10-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of [[coin]]s or cards (and PIN), Dexit used an [[RFID]] key tag device associated with funds transferred from ordinary bank accounts. There is no link to access the accounts from the key tag, a feature to guard against the abuse of lost key tags. Accounts can be filled up from the Dexit website, by telephone, at participating merchants, or through pre-approved bank account or [[credit card]] balance transfers.

A partnership between small retailers, Dexit Inc., TD Canada Trust, [[National Bank of Canada]], [[Telus Mobility]], [[Bell Canada]] in Toronto's downtown, and a few retailers in and around Toronto. There were plans to expand to the rest of Toronto in 2005; however, this does not appear to have occurred.

In the summer of 2006, Dexit announced a restructuring, and nearly all payment terminals have been removed from stores.  Dexit is also offering refunds of all funds that have been stored on Dexit Tags.

Dexit later became HDX Solutions Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itworldcanada.com/article/micropayments-and-major-disappointments/2993&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eating utensil etiquette''' covers the prescriptive systems of rules, [[etiquette]], in various cultures for using [[eating utensil]]s.

==Chopstick etiquette==
{{main|Chopsticks#Etiquette}}

In many Asian cultures, it is impolite to point with chopsticks.

==Fork etiquette==
[[Image:Fork6233.jpg|thumb|right|Dinner fork]]
When used in conjunction with a knife to cut and consume food in Western social settings, two forms of fork etiquette are common. In the ''European style'', the diner keeps the fork in his or her left hand, while in the ''American style'' the fork is shifted between the left and right hands. The ''American style'' is most common in the United States,&lt;ref name="cuisinenet"&gt;{{Cite web
  | title = How to Use a Knife, Fork, and Spoon
  | work = CuisineNet Diner's Digest
  | publisher = CuisineNet.com
  | url = http://www.cuisinenet.com/digest/custom/etiquette/utensil_howto.shtml
  | accessdate = 2008-02-27 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; but the European style is considered proper in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;"we are the only country in the world whose inhabitants shift the fork, after cutting, from the left hand to the right" [https://books.google.com/books?id=iZvD_9CByJUC&amp;dq ''Letitia Baldrige's new manners for new times: a complete guide to etiquette''], New York: Simon and Schuster, 2003, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...eating the European way, with fork in left hand and knife in right, is considered the correct way. Most Europeans have had enough contact with Americans to know that they have a different way of wielding a knife and fork. Still, some older Swedes may interpret a fork in the right hand as less-than-perfect manners." Christina Johansson Robinowitz &amp; Lisa Werner Carr, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MAn641nHfrYC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=fork+%22right+hand%22+impolite&amp;lr=&amp;ei=joe_SrCaDo_-ygSFgbnLDw&amp;client=safari#v=onepage&amp;q=fork%20%22right%20hand%22%20impolite&amp;f=false ''Modern-day Vikings: a practical guide to interacting with the Swedes''], Intercultural Press, 2001, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the traditional European method, once the fork was adopted as a utensil, was to transfer the fork to the right hand after cutting food, as it had been considered proper for all utensils to be used with the right hand only. This tradition was brought to America by British colonists and is still in use in the United States. Europe adopted the more rapid style of eating in relatively modern times. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.buffalonews.com/life/columns-advice/miss-manners/article561067.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

===European style===

The European style is to hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right. Once a bite-sized piece of food has been cut, it is conducted straight to the mouth by the left hand. For other items, such as potatoes, vegetables or rice, the blade of the knife is used to assist or guide placement of the food on the back of the fork.&lt;ref name=slate /&gt; The tines remain pointing down.

The knife and fork are both held with the handle running along the palm and extending out to be held by thumb and forefinger. This style is sometimes called "hidden handle" because the palm conceals the handle.

===American style===

In the American style, also called the ''zig-zag method'' or ''fork switching'', the [[knife]] is initially held in the right hand and the [[fork]] in the left. Holding food to the plate with the fork tines-down, a single bite-sized piece is cut with the knife. The knife is then set down on the plate, the fork transferred from the left hand to the right hand, and the food is brought to the mouth for consumption.  The fork is then transferred back to the left hand and the knife is picked up with the right.&lt;ref name="cuisinenet" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the European hidden handle grip, in the American style the fork is held much like a spoon or pen once it is transferred to the right hand to convey food to the mouth.  Though called "American style", this style originated in Europe. &lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vanhoenacker|first=Mark|title=Put a Fork in It|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/culturebox/2013/06/fork_and_knife_use_americans_need_to_stop_cutting_and_switching.html|work=[[Slate Magazine]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid style===
Etiquette experts have noted that the American style of fork-handling is in flux, often being replaced by a hybrid of the traditional American and European styles. In this new style, the fork is not switched between hands between cutting and eating, but may be deployed "tines-up" as a scoop when convenient.&lt;ref name=slate /&gt;

===Southeast Asian style===
The South East Asian style is similar to the European style, wherein the [[spoon]] is held in the right hand throughout consumption (except with certain dishes when a [[fork]] is more suitable). The difference is that [[a]] spoon is often used in the right hand and knives are rarely used. [[Rice]] and [[Soup|soups]] are a staple of the diet in South East Asian countries, so using a spoon [[would]] be practical in such dishes. The spoon is the main [[List of eating utensils|utensil]] in bringing food into the [[mouth]], in tandem with using a fork. The spoon could also be used for manipulating [[food]] in the plate and as an alternative for a knife. Often dishes require slicing before serving or sliced into small [[Portions from a Wine-stained Notebook: Short Stories and Essays|portions]] before cooking to relinquish the use of a [[knife]].

===Placement of forks===

Tables are often [[table setting|set]] with two or more forks, meant to be used for different courses; for example, a salad fork, a meat fork, and a dessert fork. Some institutions wishing to give an impression of high formality set places with many different forks for meals of several courses, although many etiquette authorities regard this as vulgar and prefer that the appropriate cutlery be brought in with each course.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuisinenet.com/glossary/setting.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It should not be necessary for the diner to distinguish between types of forks; forks are used in order from outside to inside, with the exception of oyster forks, which are placed on the right side, the tines nested in the bowl of a spoon.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Resting and finished positions===

Setting the knife and fork handles in a 5 and 7 o'clock position with the fork tines turned downwards on the plate is used to indicate to the server or host that the diner has not yet finished with the meal, while placing them together, with the fork tines turned up and the blade of the knife facing inwards, is used to indicate that the diner has finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

An '''engineering bill of materials''' ('''EBOM''') is a type of [[bill of materials]] (BOM) reflecting the product as designed by engineering, referred to as the "as-designed" bill of materials. 

The EBOM is not related to [[modular BOM]] or [[configurable BOM]] (CBOM) concepts, as modular and configurable BOMs are used to reflect selection of items to create saleable end-products.

The EBOM concept aligns to sales BOMs (as sold), service BOMs (as changed based on changes due to field service).

This BOM includes all substitute and alternate part numbers, and includes parts that are contained in drawing notes.

}}The '''Ensign-Bickford Aerospace &amp; Defense Company''' (formerly '''The Ensign-Bickford Company''') is a manufacturer of hardware and energetic systems for use in spacecraft, military, and industrial applications. It is a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of [[Ensign-Bickford Industries]].

== History ==
The Ensign-Bickford Company (EBCo) was started in 1836 in [[Simsbury, Connecticut]] as a manufacturer of [[William Bickford (1774–1834)|William Bickford]]'s [[safety fuse]] for use in [[mining]]. Safety fuse was a great advance in mining technology over the practice of filling holes with [[black powder]]. 

The next step in mining technology was [[detonating cord]]. Ensign-Bickford and other companies developed different versions of detonating cord. In 1937, Ensign-Bickford trademarked "[[Primacord]]"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/476049/Primacord&lt;/ref&gt; , which became the functional [[genericized trademark|generic name]] for detonating cord in North America. In May 2003, Ensign-Bickford sold the [[trademark]]s and processes to [[Dyno Nobel]] Inc&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dynonobel.com/about-dyno-nobel/history/&lt;/ref&gt;  of [[Australia]] (formerly of [[Norway]]).

In 1956, EBCo began providing research and development work for [[Frankford Arsenal]] and [[Sandia National Laboratories]] to develop linear shaped charge, a product critical to the early strategic missile and launch vehicle programs. In 1965, the Space Ordnance Division was formed, making contributions to early NASA programs such as [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and [[Apollo program|Apollo]]. In 1987, the Space Ordnance Division became Ensign-Bickford Aerospace Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of EBCo, later becoming The Ensign-Bickford Aerospace &amp; Defense Company.

In 2008, EBA&amp;D acquired Shock Tube Systems, and in 2010 acquired SDI Defense and Aerospace and NEA Electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eba-d.com/about-us/|title=About Us » Ensign-Bickford Aerospace &amp; Defense Company|website=www.eba-d.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locations ==
In addition to its headquarters and manufacturing operations in Simsbury, CT,  EBA&amp;D has manufacturing facilities in [[Graham, Kentucky|Graham, KY]] and [[Moorpark, California|Moorpark, CA]]. Subsidiary NEA Electronics is located within EBA&amp;D's Moorpark site.[[Image:Dyno Nobel building.JPG|thumb|Dyno Nobel building in Simsbury, Connecticut]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''ET''') describes an approach to [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[amplifier]] design in which the [[power supply]] voltage applied to the [[RF power amplifier]] is continuously adjusted to ensure that the amplifier is operating at peak efficiency for power required at each instant of transmission.

A conventional RF amplifier designed with a fixed supply voltage operates most efficiently only when operating in [[gain compression|compression]].

Amplifiers operating with a constant supply voltage become less efficient as the [[crest factor]] of the signal increases, because the amplifier spends more time operating below peak power and, therefore, spends more time operating below its maximum efficiency.

[[File:Envelope Tracking waveform.jpg|thumb|Envelope Tracking waveform]]

==Background==
The need for greater efficiency arises particularly as modulation schemes become more complicated and their peak to average power ratio increases. Older modulation schemes based on phase or [[frequency modulation]] with no amplitude information carried on the signal can use amplifiers that are driven into compression and offer high levels of efficiency. As of 2014 mobile communications basestations consumed ~1% of global electricity.&lt;ref name=tr1401/&gt;

However many new communications systems from [[WiMAX]] to [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] do use amplitude information. The amplifier cannot be run into compression, because the amplitude information becomes distorted. These amplifiers can only achieve their peak efficiency on the peaks of the amplitude. The remainder of the time power is being dissipated unnecessarily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/envelope-tracking/basics-tutorial.php Radio-Electronics.com Envelope Tracking Tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus signals with a high peak to average power ratio mean that low efficiency levels are achieved.

==Variable voltage==
Envelope tracking adjusts the voltage applied to an RF power amplifier to deliver the power needed at that instant.

Eta Devices, an MIT spinoff based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is preparing a base station module and a chip that it claims decreases battery drain and work well in high-bandwidth applications. The company says the chip helps lower electricity consumption by 20 percent and helps reduce heat generation by up to 30 percent. Eta's approach increases efficiency at the cost of greater signal noise. The company uses advanced [[digital signal processing]] to handle the problem. The Eta basestation is a little smaller than a shoebox, is the first 4G LTE transmitter to achieve average efficiency greater than 70 percent, up from the typical 45 to 55 percent.&lt;ref name=tr1401/&gt;

&lt;!-- [[Image:Forest RailwayNasswald1.jpg|thumb|A [[Naßwald Forest Railway]] museum railway train]] --&gt;A '''forest railway''', '''forest tram''', '''timber line''', '''logging railway''' or '''logging railroad''' is a mode of [[railway transport]] which is used for [[forestry]] tasks, primarily the transportation of [[felling|felled]] logs to [[sawmill]]s or railway stations.

In most cases this form of transport utilised narrow gauges, and were temporary in nature, and in rough and sometimes difficult to access terrain.

== History ==
Before the railway was invented, logs were transported in large numbers from the forest down rivers either freely or on wooden rafts. This was not without its problems and wood was often damaged in transit, lost in floods or stranded in shallow water. Suitable rivers were often unavailable in mountainous terrain.

[[Image:Early-Shay.jpg|thumb|[[Shay locomotive]] on an American forest railway]]
[[Image:Mine lokomotiv El-9 in Kemence.JPG|thumb|right|Tourist trains and narrow gauge museum at the [[Kemence Forest Museum Railway]].]]
Simple [[wagonway]]s, using horses and wooden rails, were used from the 18th century. However the invention of the [[steam locomotive]] and steel rails soon led to these being employed for forestry. However the difficult terrain within forests meant that narrow-gauge railways, which took up less space, were lighter and easier to build and enabled tight curves to be laid, were preferred. These were the so-called forest railways. In particularly large areas of forest or forests of unusually large trees, such as in the northwestern USA, extensive forest railways were even built using standard gauge exclusively for forestry tasks. Special geared locomotives such as the [[Shay locomotive|Shay]] and [[Climax locomotive]] were developed for high tractive effort on rough track. Some forest railways became common carriers when cleared forest land was converted to agricultural or recreational use. 

[[File:"Perdido", a pole road locomotive.jpg|thumb|''Perdido'', a steam [[pole road]] locomotive]]
In cases where the railway itself was considered very short-term, or the region was extremely difficult to access, logs would often be laid into the ground as a [[wagonway#pole road|pole road]], rather than the cost and logistics of laying steel rails and sleepers. Pole roads could be extensive; several examples in the southeastern [[United States]] extended up to 20 miles at the end of the nineteenth century, and used purpose-built steam locomotives.&lt;ref name="Trains_1948"&gt;"Pole Road Locomotives of the Early Days," ''[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]]'' magazine, February 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to steam traction, diesel and petrol-driven locomotives were also used later on. These largely brought animal-hauled transportation to an end on the forest railways. Also common were routes that just used gravity. Wagons loaded with wood would simply roll downhill in a controlled fashion under the pull of gravity. Foresters also travelled on these, at some risk to their lives on occasions&amp;nbsp;– as brakemen. Empty wagons were hauled uphill again by horses.

From the second half of the 20th century forest railways were threatened by road transportation and by the end of the 1960s they had practically disappeared from western Europe. Roads were often laid in their place on the old trackbeds.

In a few Eastern European countries forest railways survived longer, particularly in [[Russia]] where there are still some today. In [[Hungary]] too there are several forest railways in active service today, some are also used for tourist traffic. The numerous forest railway operations in [[Romania]] were closed, with a few exceptions, by the 1990s. In Western Europe there are very few which are even preserved as [[museum railway]]s.

In Asia and Oceania (Australia and New Zealand) the history and fate of logging tramways/forest railways is similar to Europe, with most lines either converted to motorised truck transport or closing down in the 1960s.  Significant numbers of locomotives and other remnants of the former lines are found in museums and museum railways in Australia.

== Logging railroads in North America ==
A '''logging railroad''' describes [[Rail transport|railroads]], [[pole road]]s, [[tram road]]s, or similar [[infrastructure]] used to transport harvested timber from a logging site to a [[sawmill]]. Logging railroads vary in [[Track gauge|gauge]] and length, with most [[forest]]ed regions of the world supporting a railroad of this type at some point.

While most railroads of this variety were temporary, it was not uncommon for permanent railroads to take their place as a complement to logging operations or as an independent operation once logging ended.

'''Glazing''', which derives from the [[Middle English]] for 'glass', is a part of a [[wall]] or [[window]], made of [[glass]].&lt;ref&gt;Definition of ''glazing'' at [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glazing Merriam-Webster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231000931/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glazing |date=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Definition of ''glazing'' at [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/glazing?q=glazing Cambridge Dictionaries Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930065434/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/glazing?q=glazing |date=2012-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glazing also describes the work done by a professional "[[glazier]]". Glazing is also less commonly used to describe the insertion of ophthalmic lenses into an eyeglass frame.

Common types of glazing that are used in architectural applications include clear and tinted [[float glass]], [[tempered glass]], and [[laminated glass]] as well as a variety of coated glasses, all of which can be glazed singly or as [[Insulated glazing|double, or even triple]], glazing units. Ordinary clear glass has a slight green tinge but special colorless glasses are offered by several manufacturers.

Glazing can be mounted on the surface of a [[window]] [[Sash window|sash]] or [[door]] [[Frame and panel|stile]], usually made of [[wood]], [[aluminium]] or [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. The glass is fixed into a [[rabbet|rabbet (rebate)]] in the frame in a number of ways including triangular glazing points, [[putty]], etc.  Toughened and laminated glass can be glazed by bolting panes directly to a metal framework by bolts passing through drilled holes.

Glazing is commonly used in low temperature solar thermal collectors because it helps retain the collected heat.

When combined with [[ammonium dinitramide|ADM]] or [[ammonium nitrate|AN]] oxidizers, the amount of [[hydrogen cyanide|HCN]] produced by a deflagration may be reduced.  The compound is thus considered by its advocates to be a more environmentally friendly explosive than traditional [[nitroamine]]-based explosives.

The '''homework gap''' refers to the difficulty students experience completing homework when they lack [[internet access]] at home, compared to those who have access.  According to a [[Pew Research Center]] analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey data from 2013, there were approximately 5 million households with school-age children in the United States that lacked access to high-speed Internet service.&lt;ref name=Pew&gt;Horrigan, John B. (April&amp;nbsp;20, 2015). "[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/20/the-numbers-behind-the-broadband-homework-gap The Numbers Behind the Broadband Homework Gap]". Pew Research Center. pewresearch.org. Retrieved December&amp;nbsp;15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Low-income households and minority households made up a “disproportionate” share of those 5 million households; 31.4% of households with school-age children whose incomes fell below $50,000 fell into the group without internet access at home.&lt;ref name=Pew/&gt; According to Pew, this group makes up about 40% of all families with school-age children in the United States.&lt;ref name=Pew/&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Affordability ===
One of the most commonly cited reasons for students’ lack of internet access at home is that it costs too much for their families to afford. In one study of K-12 students who did not have home internet access, 38% of all the families who were surveyed reported that it was too expensive for them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017098/index.asp|title=Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the homework gap is commonly thought of as a problem that mostly affects rural students, its greatest impact falls on students who live in urban areas, who have internet plans available to them but whose families cannot afford the price. Out of 64 million Americans with no internet access, only 16 million live in areas where there is no infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Leila|date=June/July 2016|title=HOME CONNECTIVITY AND THE HOMEWORK GAP|url=|journal=T H E Journal|volume=43|pages=16-20|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some students who report having internet access at home are only able to use the internet through smartphones and mobile [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspots]], in which case their usage depends on having enough data on their family’s monthly data plan. Studies suggest that students whose families rely on mobile phones for internet usage often run out of data quickly or periodically lose access to phone service due to bills not being paid&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://equityinlearning.act.org/wp-content/themes/voltron/img/tech-briefs/the-digital-divide.pdf|title=The Digital Divide|last=Moore, Vitale, Stawinoga|first=|date=August 2018|website=ACT Center for Equity in Learning|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, making it an unreliable internet source for students needing to complete school work.

=== Lack of infrastructure ===
Some students in rural areas of the United States are unable to access the internet at home because the infrastructure for internet access does not exist where they live. A study conducted by the Institute of Education Sciences in 2015 found that 18% of students living in remote rural areas had either no internet access or they only had [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up]] internet access.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017098/index.asp|title=Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if students in rural areas are able to access the internet at home, it is likely that their internet speed is inadequate. According to a 2015 FCC report, 53% of Americans living in rural areas could not reach 25 [[Mbps]] download speed, which is the benchmark [[broadband]] speed set by the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/2015-broadband-progress-report|title=2015 Broadband Progress Report|date=2015-02-04|work=Federal Communications Commission|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socioeconomic ===
[[File:Connected_by_race.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Connected_by_race.png|thumb|A graph showing internet connectivity over time by race]]
Studies have shown that a student’s likeliness of having no internet access at home is increased by several socioeconomic factors. An important factor is the level of education of students’ parents: 71% of children whose parents had a bachelor’s degree had internet access in their homes in 2015. Comparatively, only 42% of children whose parents had not completed high school had internet access. For students whose families earned a higher income, they were more likely to have internet access at home compared with students whose families earned a lower income or were below the poverty line. Students who are racial or ethnic minorities tend to have a lower percentage of internet usage at home than students who are white.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Impact ==
Students who lack internet access at home risk falling behind on schoolwork, as well as being unable to learn technology skills that are needed for many jobs. Being unable to learn internet skills at a young age could put students at a disadvantage in the future. 94% of low income school districts utilize homework that is online, which makes internet access a necessity for students.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://equitablegrowth.org/closing-the-homework-gap-why-accessibility-to-high-quality-broadband-matters-to-u-s-schoolchildren/|title=Closing the homework gap: Why accessibility to high-quality broadband matters to U.S. schoolchildren - Equitable Growth|date=2018-09-28|work=Equitable Growth|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to complete homework, students may resort to such measures as waiting for hours to use a public library computer or standing outside of their school after hours to try and pick up a WiFi signal. Research on the correlation between internet access and school performance has been limited. However, one study has shown a significant difference between states that have higher broadband access and states that do not, with the latter having students that tend to achieve lower scores in academic subjects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another study found that in 2015, almost 50% of students surveyed said that they had missed assignments due to lack of internet access.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With the homework gap impacting low-income populations, it is possible that the achievement gap between different socioeconomic groups of students will grow.

== Initiatives ==

=== U.S. policy changes ===
Policymakers in the United States have highlighted the homework gap as an issue of national importance. President [[Barack Obama]] cited the homework gap in launching the [[ConnectHome]] initiative in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;The White House (July&amp;nbsp;15, 2015). "[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/15/fact-sheet-connecthome-coming-together-ensure-digital-opportunity-all Fact Sheet: ConnectHome: Coming Together to Ensure Digital Opportunity for All Americans]" (press release). Obama White House Archives. obamawhitehouse.archives.gov. Retrieved December&amp;nbsp;15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Angus King]] (I-ME) and Senator [[Shelley Moore]] Capito (R-WV) introduced legislation on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release, King, Capito Introduce Bill to Give Low-Income, Rural Students Educational Tools Needed to Succeed, Last Retrieved July 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; FCC Commissioner [[Jessica Rosenworcel]], who is credited with coining the term the “homework gap,”&lt;ref&gt;FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, “How to Close the Homework Gap”, Miami Herald, Last Retrieved July 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; has encouraged changes to U.S. [[broadband internet]] and wi-fi policies to address this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenworcel, Jessica, FCC Commissioner (June&amp;nbsp;15, 2015). "[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jessica-rosenworcel/bridging-the-homework-gap_b_7590042.html Bridging the Homework Gap]". ''Huffington Post''. huffingtonpost.com. Retrieved December&amp;nbsp;16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The homework gap has been referred to some as a civil rights issue, as students are being denied information. In 2012, the United States government created a division called the [[Open Technology Fund]]. This program was created by the government to help support internet freedom technologies that ensure access, circumvent censorship, surveillance, and to promote human rights in the United States and on a global scale. This program is solely funded by grants and donations by interested parties. The goal is to have the access to the internet not be restricted by outside parties, attempting to ensure there are no conflicts of interest in regards to content being delivered to consumers.  Currently, the program is working on completing and funding approximately 83 projects in upwards of 20 different countries, with most of the projects focusing on the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opentech.fund/|title=Supporting Internet Freedom Worldwide|last=|first=|date=|website=opentech|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile hotspot programs ===
Mobile hotspot lending programs have been an effective strategy for increasing access to the internet. These programs, while opening access to the internet to those that can not afford it, are limited to only being helpful to students with access to smart devices, or some form of laptop computer.  There are a number of different mobile hotspot lending programs attempting to increase the availability to the internet for students.  For example, there is the Kajeet SmartSpot.  With this device, students get filtered Internet access anytime, in any location. Additionally, educators receive reports into student use of digital resources that can inform future academic strategies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kajeet.net/kajeet-smartspot|title=Wireless Technology In Education {{!}} Kajeet Smartspot|last=Kajeet|website=www.kajeet.net|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WiFi on school buses ===
One attempt to connect students to the internet is the implementation of WiFi on certain school buses.  In North Carolina and Missouri, WiFi was added to school buses so students could finish their homework while they commuted to school. An example of this program is offered via Kajeet Smartbus. The benefit of this program has been linked to not only students completing their homework assignments more often, but also to better overall behavior on the daily bus commutes, offering relief for teachers, school employees, parents, students, and bus drivers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While North Carolina and Missouri were test states, the program is expecting to expand to other states that struggle with the homework gap.  However, as with the mobile hotspot programs, these programs are only efficient if the students have access to hardware like a computer, tablet, or in some cases smartphones, that allow them to access the internet.

A '''hydrogen vehicle''' is a [[vehicle]] that uses [[hydrogen]] as its onboard fuel for [[motive power]]. Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen-fueled [[space rocket]]s, as well as [[automobile]]s and other transportation vehicles. The power plants of such vehicles convert the [[chemical energy]] of hydrogen to [[mechanical energy]] either by burning hydrogen in an [[internal combustion engine]], or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a [[fuel cell]] to run electric motors. Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed [[hydrogen economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iphe.net/docs/Resources/Power_trains_for_Europe.pdf|title=A portfolio of power-trains for Europe: a fact-based analysis|author=|date=|website=iphe.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2016}}, there are three hydrogen cars publicly available in select markets: the [[Toyota Mirai]], the [[Hyundai Nexo]], and the [[Honda Clarity]]. Several other companies are working to develop hydrogen cars. As of 2014, 95% of hydrogen is made from natural gas.

[[File:Boeing Fuel Cell Demonstrator AB1.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Boeing]] Fuel Cell Demonstrator powered by a hydrogen fuel cell]]
Companies such as [[Boeing]], [[Lange Aviation]], and the [[German Aerospace Center]] pursue hydrogen as fuel for manned and unmanned airplanes. In February 2008 Boeing tested a manned flight of a small aircraft powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. Unmanned hydrogen planes have also been tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091013123350.htm |title=Ion tiger hydrogen UAV |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2009-10-15 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For large passenger airplanes, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that "Boeing said that hydrogen fuel cells were unlikely to power the engines of large passenger jet airplanes but could be used as backup or auxiliary power units onboard."&lt;ref name="Apr08Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article3675188.ece|title=Boeing tests first hydrogen powered plane|publisher=The Times|author=David Robertson|date=3 April 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, Boeing unveiled its hydrogen-powered [[Boeing Phantom Eye|Phantom Eye]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]], powered by two Ford internal-combustion engines that have been converted to run on hydrogen.&lt;ref name="The Register "&gt;{{cite news |title= oeing's 'Phantom Eye' Ford Fusion powered stratocraft |publisher= The Register |date= 2010-07-13 |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/07/13/phantom_eye_rollout/ |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the [[Reaction Engines A2]] has been proposed to use the thermodynamic properties of [[liquid hydrogen]] to achieve very high speed, long distance (antipodal) flight by burning it in a [[precooled jet engine]].

===Fork trucks===
A HICE forklift or HICE lift truck is a hydrogen fueled, [[internal combustion engine]]-powered industrial [[forklift truck]] used for lifting and [[transport]]ing materials.  The first production HICE forklift truck based on the Linde X39 Diesel was presented at an exposition in [[Hannover]] on May 27, 2008. It used a 2.0 litre, {{convert|43|kW|abbr=on}} diesel internal combustion engine converted to use hydrogen as a fuel with the use of a compressor and [[fuel injection#Direct injection|direct injection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-35668015_ITM |title=Hydrogen engines get a lift |publisher=Accessmylibrary.com |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HyICE"&gt;[https://www.hfpeurope.org/uploads/700/836/2005_HFP_Brussels_HyICE.pdf HyICE]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[fuel cell forklift]] (also called a fuel cell lift truck) is a fuel cell powered industrial forklift truck. In 2013 there were over 4,000 fuel cell forklifts used in [[material handling]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130821025808/http://www.fuelcells.org/pdfs/FuelCellForkliftsGainGround.pdf Press release: "Fuel Cell Forklifts Gain Ground"], fuelcells.org, July 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The global market was estimated at 1 million fuel cell powered forklifts per year for 2014–2016.&lt;ref name=Report&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-and-chinese-forklift-industry-report-2014-2016-281752401.html "Global and Chinese Forklift Industry Report, 2014-2016"], Research and Markets, November 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Fleets are being operated by companies around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fchea.org/core/import/PDFs/Materials%20Handling%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf "Fact Sheet: Materials Handling and Fuel Cells"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813034632/http://fchea.org/core/import/PDFs/Materials%20Handling%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |date=2012-08-13 }}; {{cite web|url=http://www.hylift-projects.eu/|title=HyLIFT - Clean Efficient Power for Materials Handling|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}; {{cite web| url=http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/news-events/news-archive/2013/may/first-hydrogen-station-for-fuel-cell-forklift-trucks-in-france,-for-ikea|title=First Hydrogen Station for Fuel Cell Forklift Trucks in France, for IKEA|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.horizonhydrogeneenergie.com/pile-a-combustible-pour-chariot-elevateur.html|title=Technologie HyPulsion : des piles pour véhicules de manutention - Horizon Hydrogène Énergie|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}; and {{cite web| url=http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/news-events/news-archive/2013/october/hygear-delivers-hydrogen-system-for-fuel-cell-based-forklift-trucks|title=HyGear Delivers Hydrogen System for Fuel Cell Based Forklift Trucks|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pike Research stated in 2011 that fuel-cell-powered forklifts will be the largest driver of hydrogen fuel demand by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmentalleader.com/2011/07/20/hydrogen-fueling-stations-could-reach-5200-by-2020/ "Hydrogen Fueling Stations Could Reach 5,200 by 2020"]. Environmental Leader: Environmental &amp; Energy Management News, 20 July 2011, accessed 2 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Most companies in Europe and the US do not use petroleum powered forklifts, as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric forklifts.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/forklift_anl_esd.pdf Full Fuel-Cycle Comparison of Forklift Propulsion Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217104928/http://www2.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/forklift_anl_esd.pdf |date=2013-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel-cell-powered forklifts can provide benefits over battery powered forklifts as they can be refueled in 3 minutes. They can be used in refrigerated warehouses, as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures. The fuel cell units are often designed as drop-in replacements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.still.co.uk/fuel-cell-technology-uk.0.0.html|title=Fuel cell technology|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graftechaet.com/getattachment/065811d2-720e-40c6-b236-0440c4d90d76/OFCC-Forklift-Case-Study.aspx|title=Creating Innovative Graphite Solutions for Over 125 Years|work=GrafTech International|accessdate=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206072419/http://www.graftechaet.com/getattachment/065811d2-720e-40c6-b236-0440c4d90d76/OFCC-Forklift-Case-Study.aspx|archive-date=6 December 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rockets===
Many large [[rocket]]s use [[liquid hydrogen]] as fuel, with [[liquid oxygen]] as an oxidizer (LH2/LOX). An advantage of hydrogen rocket fuel is the high [[effective exhaust velocity]] compared to [[kerosene]]/[[LOX]] or [[UDMH]]/[[Nitrogen tetroxide|NTO]] engines. According to the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]], a rocket with higher exhaust velocity uses less propellant to accelerate. Also the [[energy density]] of hydrogen is greater than any other fuel.&lt;ref name="H2"&gt;College of the Desert, “Module 1, Hydrogen Properties”, Revision 0, December 2001 [http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/03/f12/fcm01r0.pdf Hydrogen Properties]. Retrieved 2015-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; LH2/LOX also yields the greatest efficiency in relation to the amount of propellant consumed, of any known rocket propellant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/hydrogen/hydrogen_fuel_of_choice.html|title=NASA - Liquid Hydrogen--the Fuel of Choice for Space Exploration|author=|date=|website=www.nasa.gov|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A disadvantage of LH2/LOX engines is the low density and low temperature of liquid hydrogen, which means bigger and insulated and thus heavier fuel tanks are needed. This increases the rocket's structural mass which reduces its delta-v significantly.  Another disadvantage is the poor storability of LH2/LOX-powered rockets: Due to the constant hydrogen boil-off, the rocket must be fueled shortly before launch, which makes cryogenic engines unsuitable for [[ICBM]]s and other rocket applications with the need for short launch preparations.

Overall, the delta-v of a hydrogen stage is typically not much different from that of a dense fuelled stage, but the weight of a hydrogen stage is much less, which makes it particularly effective for upper stages, since they are carried by the lower stages. For first stages, dense fuelled rockets in studies may show a small advantage, due to the smaller vehicle size and lower air drag.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, George P. and Oscar Biblarz. [http://web.mit.edu/e_peters/Public/Rockets/Rocket_Propulsion_Elements.pdf ''Rocket Propulsion Elements''], Seventh edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons (2001), p. 257, {{ISBN|0-471-32642-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LH2/LOX were also used in the [[Space Shuttle]] to run the fuel cells that power the electrical systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/hydrogen/fc_shuttle.html |title=Fuel cell use in the Space Shuttle |publisher=NASA |date= |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The byproduct of the fuel cell is water, which is used for drinking and other applications that require water in space.

==Internal combustion vehicle==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ford Motor Company]] --&gt;
{{Main|Hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle|List of hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles}}
Hydrogen internal combustion engine cars are different from hydrogen fuel cell cars. The [[Hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle|hydrogen internal combustion car]] is a slightly modified version of the traditional gasoline [[internal combustion engine]] car. These hydrogen engines burn fuel in the same manner that gasoline engines do; the main difference is the exhaust product. Gasoline combustion results in [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water vapour|water vapor]], while the only exhaust product of hydrogen combustion is water vapor.

In 1807 [[Francois Isaac de Rivaz]] designed [[De Rivaz engine|the first hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h2cars.de/1_cardata/c214.htm|title=H2Mobility - Hydrogen Vehicles - netinform|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[Roger Billings]], then a high school student, converted a [[Ford Model A (1927–1931)|Model A]] to run on hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogencarsnow.com/index.php/1807-1986 "Hydrogen Fuel Cars 1807–1986"], Hydrogen Cars Now, accessed April 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Paul Dieges patented a modification to internal combustion engines which allowed a gasoline-powered engine to run on hydrogen {{Cite patent|US|3844262}}.

The molecular hydrogen needed as an onboard fuel for hydrogen vehicles can be obtained through many thermochemical methods utilizing [[natural gas]], [[coal]] (by a process known as coal gasification), [[liquefied petroleum gas]], [[biomass]] ([[biomass gasification]]), by a process called [[thermolysis]], or as a microbial waste product called [[biohydrogen]] or [[biological hydrogen production (Algae)|Biological hydrogen production]]. 95% of hydrogen is produced using natural gas,&lt;ref name=Stupendous&gt;Suplee, Curt. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/16/AR2009111602668.html "Don't bet on a hydrogen car anytime soon"]. ''Washington Post'', November 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and 85% of hydrogen produced is used to remove sulfur from gasoline. Hydrogen can also be produced from [[water]] by [[electrolysis]] at working efficiencies in the 50–60% range for the smaller electrolysers and around 65–70% for the larger plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hyweb.de/Knowledge/w-i-energiew-eng3.html#3.4 |title= Chapter 3: Production of Hydrogen.

===Storage===
{{Details|Hydrogen storage}}
[[Image:Blue diamond compressed hydrogen.jpg|thumb|upright|Compressed hydrogen storage mark]]
Compressed hydrogen in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for hydrogen tank systems in vehicles, based on type IV carbon-composite technology.&lt;ref name=store&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure: status 2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987484_Fuel_cell_electric_vehicles_and_hydrogen_infrastructure_status_2012?ev=prf_pub|last1=Eberle|first1=Ulrich|first2=Bernd|last2=Mueller|first3=Rittmar|last3=von Helmolt|publisher=[[Energy &amp; Environmental Science]] |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogen has a very low volumetric energy [[density]] at ambient conditions, equal to about one-third that of methane. Even when the fuel is stored as [[liquid hydrogen]] in a [[cryogenic]] tank or in a [[compressed hydrogen]] [[hydrogen tank|storage tank]], the volumetric energy density (megajoules per liter) is small relative to that of gasoline.&lt;ref name=lanz/&gt;&lt;ref name=zubrin121/&gt;&lt;ref name=olah155/&gt;&lt;ref name=RSC2/&gt; Hydrogen has three times higher [[specific energy]] by [[mass]] compared to gasoline (143 MJ/kg versus 46.9 MJ/kg).

Under heavy criticism, the funding was partially restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/cars/obama-kills-hydrogen-car-funding.html|title=Obama Kills Hydrogen Car Funding|author=|date=|website=treehugger.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/05/08/obama-doe-slash-hydrogen-fuel-cell-funding-in-new-budget|title=Obama, DOE slash hydrogen fuel cell funding in new budget|author=|date=|website=autoblog.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the Obama administration announced they want to speed up production and development of hydrogen powered vehicles.  The Department of Energy planned to spread a $7.2 million investment among the states of Georgia, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee to support projects that fuel vehicles and support power systems. The Center for Transportation and The Environment, Fed Ex Express, Air Products and Chemicals, and Sprint have invested in the development of fuel cells. Fuel cells could also be used in handling equipment such as forklifts as well as telecommunications infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/green-tech/fuel-cells/obama-administration-wants-to-speed-up-hydrogenpowered-vehicles|title=Obama Administration Wants to Speed Up Hydrogen-Powered Vehicles|author=Ken Silverstein|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Byron L. Dorgan|Senator Byron L. Dorgan]] stated in 2013: “The Energy and Water Appropriations bill makes investments in our nation’s efforts to develop safe, homegrown energy sources that will reduce our reliance on foreign oil. And, because ongoing research and development is necessary to develop game-changing technologies, this bill also restores funding for Hydrogen energy research”. In June 2013, the U.S. Department of Energy gave 9 million dollars in grants to speed up technology development, 4.5 million for advanced fuel cell membranes, $3 million to 3M corporation to work on membranes with improved durability and performance, and 1.5 million to the Colorado School of Mines for work on simpler and more affordable fuel cell membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://green.autoblog.com/2013/08/07/doe-funds-more-hydrogen-fuel-cell-research-with-4-5m-investment/|title=DOE funds more hydrogen fuel cell research with $4.5m investment| author=Jon LeSage|work=Autoblog|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of hydrogen vehicles are presented in the 2006 documentary, ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]''.  According to former [[U.S. Department of Energy]] official [[Joseph Romm]], "A hydrogen car is one of the least efficient, most expensive ways to reduce greenhouse gases." Asked when hydrogen cars will be broadly available, Romm replied: "Not in our lifetime, and very possibly never."&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/staff/robert_boyd/story/16179.html |title=Hydrogen cars may be a long time coming |last=Boyd |first=Robert S. |date=May 15, 2007 |work= |publisher=McClatchy Newspapers |accessdate=9 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501193814/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/staff/robert_boyd/story/16179.html |archivedate=1 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote, in 2009, "Hydrogen fuel-cell technology won't work in cars. ...

''[[The Economist]]'' magazine, in 2008, quoted [[Robert Zubrin]], the author of ''[[Energy Victory]]'', as saying: "Hydrogen is 'just about the worst possible vehicle fuel'".&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;Wrigglesworth, Phil.

The revised mandate allows manufacturers to comply with the rules by building more battery-electric cars instead of fuel-cell vehicles."&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; The magazine also noted that most hydrogen is produced through steam reformation, which creates at least as much emission of carbon per mile as some of today's gasoline cars. On the other hand, if the hydrogen could be produced using renewable energy, "it would surely be easier simply to use this energy to charge the batteries of all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles."&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

A 2009 study at [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]], published in the ''Journal of Power Sources'', similarly found that, over their lifetimes, hydrogen vehicles will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles.&lt;ref name=UCDavis&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/lifestyle/cars-lifestyle/hydrogen-cars-lifecycle-emits-more-carbon-than-gas-cars-study-says/ "Hydrogen Cars' Lifecycle Emits More Carbon Than Gas Cars, Study Says",] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106211628/http://www.digitaltrends.com/lifestyle/cars-lifestyle/hydrogen-cars-lifecycle-emits-more-carbon-than-gas-cars-study-says/ |date=2010-01-06 }} ''[[Digital Trends]]'', January 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This agrees with a 2014 analysis.&lt;ref name=Cox2014/&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' asked in 2009, "[W]hy would you want to store energy in the form of hydrogen and then use that hydrogen to produce electricity for a motor, when electrical energy is already waiting to be sucked out of sockets all over America and stored in auto batteries"?&lt;ref name=Stupendous/&gt;  ''[[The Motley Fool]]'' stated in 2013 that "there are still cost-prohibitive obstacles [for hydrogen cars] relating to transportation, storage, and, most importantly, production."&lt;ref&gt;Chatsko, Maxx.

Volkswagen's Rudolf Krebs said in 2013 that "no matter how excellent you make the cars themselves, the laws of physics hinder their overall efficiency. The most efficient way to convert energy to mobility is electricity." He elaborated: "Hydrogen mobility only makes sense if you use green energy", but ... you need to convert it first into hydrogen "with low efficiencies" where "you lose about 40 percent of the initial energy". You then must compress the hydrogen and store it under high pressure in tanks, which uses more energy. "And then you have to convert the hydrogen back to electricity in a fuel cell with another efficiency loss". Krebs continued: "in the end, from your original 100 percent of electric energy, you end up with 30 to 40 percent."&lt;ref&gt;Blanco, Sebastian.

If that energy does not come from renewable sources, then fuel-cell cars are not as clean as they seem. ... Another challenge is the lack of infrastructure. Gas stations need to invest in the ability to refuel hydrogen tanks before [[FCEV]]s [fuel cell electric vehicles] become practical, and it's unlikely many will do that while there are so few customers on the road today. ... Compounding the lack of infrastructure is the high cost of the technology. Fuel cells are "still very, very expensive".&lt;ref name=Davies1&gt;Davies, Alex.

The PHEV concept augments standard [[hybrid electric vehicles]] with the ability to recharge their batteries from an external source, enabling increased use of the vehicle's electric motors while reducing their reliance on internal combustion engines. The infrastructure required to charge PHEVs is already in place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnl.gov/news/release.asp?id=204 |title=US government news release |publisher=Pnl.gov |date=2006-12-11 |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transmission of power from grid to car is about 93% efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerwatch.org.uk/energy/graham.asp |title=Domestic Energy use in the UK |publisher=Powerwatch |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, is not the only energy loss in transferring power from grid to wheels. AC/DC conversion must take place from the grids AC supply to the PHEV's DC. This is roughly 98% efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cr4.globalspec.com/blogentry/434/Transformer-Efficiency-Standards-Proposed |title=CR4 - Blog Entry: Transformer Efficiency Standards Proposed |publisher=Google.co.uk |date=6 November 2006 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battery then must be charged. As of 2007, the [[Lithium iron phosphate battery]] was between 80-90% efficient in charging/discharging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluginhighway.ca/PHEV2007/proceedings/PluginHwy_PHEV2007_PaperReviewed_Valoen.pdf |title=Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle 2007 Conference - Home |publisher= |accessdate=30 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326150713/http://www.pluginhighway.ca/PHEV2007/proceedings/PluginHwy_PHEV2007_PaperReviewed_Valoen.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The battery needs to be cooled; the GM Volt's battery has four coolers and two radiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stewart |first=Ben |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4257460.html |title=Chevy Volt Plug-in Car Batteries Ready for 2010 - GM Technical Center |publisher=Popular Mechanics |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=19 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604044820/http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4257460.html |archivedate=4 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, "the total well-to-wheels efficiency with which a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle might utilize renewable electricity is roughly 20% (although that number could rise to 25% or a little higher with the kind of multiple technology breakthroughs required to enable a hydrogen economy). The well-to-wheels efficiency of charging an onboard battery and then discharging it to run an electric motor in a PHEV or EV, however, is 80% (and could be higher in the future)—four times more efficient than current hydrogen fuel cell vehicle pathways."&lt;ref name=EnergyCollective/&gt;  A 2006 article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' argued that PHEVs, rather than hydrogen vehicles, would become standard in the automobile industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph J. Romm|Romm, Joseph]] and Prof. [[Andrew A. Frank]].

===Natural gas===
{{Main|natural gas vehicle}}
[[Internal combustion engine]]-based [[compressed natural gas]](CNG), [[HCNG]] or [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG]] vehicles ([[Natural gas vehicle]]s or NGVs) use methane ([[Natural gas]] or [[Biogas]]) directly as a fuel source. Natural gas has a higher [[energy density]] than hydrogen gas. NGVs using biogas are nearly [[carbon neutral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov/ncer/p3/press/04_22_07.html|title=Car Fueled With Biogas From Cow Manure: WWU Students Convert Methane Into Natural Gas|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike hydrogen vehicles, CNG vehicles have been available for many years, and there is sufficient infrastructure to provide both commercial and home refueling stations. Worldwide, there were 14.8 million natural gas vehicles by the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngvjournal.dreamhosters.com/en/statistics/item/911-worldwide-ngv-statistics |title=Worldwide NGV Statistics |publisher=NGV Journal |accessdate=2012-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220030004/http://www.ngvjournal.dreamhosters.com/en/statistics/item/911-worldwide-ngv-statistics |archivedate=2012-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other use for natural gas is in [[steam reforming]] which is the common way to produce hydrogen gas for use in electric cars with fuel cells.

===All-electric vehicles===
{{main|electric car}}
A 2008 ''Technology Review'' article stated, "Electric cars—and plug-in hybrid cars—have an enormous advantage over hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles in utilizing low-carbon electricity.  That is because of the inherent inefficiency of the entire hydrogen fueling process, from generating the hydrogen with that electricity to transporting this diffuse gas long distances, getting the hydrogen in the car, and then running it through a fuel cell—all for the purpose of converting the hydrogen back into electricity to drive the same exact electric motor you'll find in an electric car."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/guest/22087/ "The Last Car You Would Ever Buy – Literally: Why we shouldn't get excited by the latest hydrogen cars"], ''Technology Review'', June 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Thermodynamically, each additional step in the conversion process decreases the overall efficiency of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficiency of Hydrogen PEFC, Diesel-SOFC-Hybrid and Battery Electric Vehicles |date=15 July 2003 |url=http://www.efcf.com/reports/E04.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=January 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021051748/http://www.efcf.com/reports/E04.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cta.ornl.gov/data/index.shtml |title=Information from |publisher=cta.ornl.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 comparison of hydrogen and [[battery electric vehicle]]s agreed with the 25% figure from Ulf Bossel in 2006 and stated that the cost of an [[electric vehicle battery]] "is rapidly coming down, and the gap will widen further", while there is little "existing infrastructure to transport, store and deliver hydrogen to vehicles and would cost billions of dollars to put into place, everyone's household power sockets are "electric vehicle refueling" station and the "cost of electricity (depending on the source) is at least 75% cheaper than hydrogen."&lt;ref&gt;Dansie, Mark. [http://revolution-green.com/hydrogen-vs-electric/ "Hydrogen vs Electric"], revolution-green.com, July 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[National Academy of Sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18264|title=Transitions to Alternative Vehicles and Fuels - The National Academies Press|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DOE stated that even under optimistic conditions by 2030 the price for the battery is not expected to go below $17,000 ($200–$250/kWh) on 300 miles of range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/11/16/toyotas-hydrogen-vs-teslas-batteries-which-car-wil.aspx|title=Toyota’s Hydrogen vs. Tesla’s Batteries: Which Car Will Win?|author=Katie Spence|date=16 November 2013|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Matthew Mench, from the [[University of Tennessee]] stated: "If we are sitting around waiting for a battery breakthrough that will give us four times the range than we have now, we are going to be waiting for a long time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-auto-show-fuel-cell-20131117,0,3678128.story?page=2#axzz2lGKcgiZs|title=L.A. Auto Show: Will fuel cells make battery electric cars obsolete?|author=Los Angeles Times|date=18 November 2013|work=latimes.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navigant Research, (formerly Pike research), on the other hand, forecasts that “lithium-ion costs, which are tipping the scales at about $500 per kilowatt hour now, could fall to $300 by 2015 and to $180 by 2020.”&lt;ref&gt;King, Danny. [http://green.autoblog.com/2013/11/08/li-ion-battery-prices-headed--down-180-kwh/ “Li-ion battery prices still headed way, way down, to $180/kWh by 2020”], ‘’AutoblogGreen’’, November 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Takeshi Uchiyamada, a designer of the [[Toyota Prius]] stated: "Because of its shortcomings – driving range, cost and recharging time – the electric vehicle is not a viable replacement for most conventional cars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/04/us-autos-electric-hydrogen-idUSBRE91304Z20130204|title=Insight: Electric cars head toward another dead end|work=Reuters|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[electric car]] designs offer limited driving range causing [[range anxiety]]. For example, the 2013 [[Nissan Leaf]] has a range of {{Convert|75|mi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmunds.com/car-news/2013-nissan-leaf-gets-fuel-econom-range-improvement-says-epa.html "2013 Nissan Leaf Gets Fuel Economy, Range Improvement, Says EPA"], Edmunds.com, May 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; the 2014 [[Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive]] has an estimated range of {{Convert|115|mi|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Jablansky, Jeffrey.

European Environment Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''The New York Times'' stated that there are only 10 publicly accessible hydrogen-filling stations in the U.S., eight of which are in Southern California, and that BEVs' cost-per-mile expense in 2013 is one-third as much as hydrogen cars when comparing electricity from the grid and hydrogen at a filling station. The ''Times'' commented: "By the time Toyota sells its first fuel-cell sedan, there will be about half-million plug-in vehicles on the road in the United States – and tens of thousands of E.V. charging stations."&lt;ref name=Berman2013/&gt; In 2013 John Swanton of the [[California Air Resources Board]], who sees them as complementary technologies, stated that EVs have the jump on fuel-cell autos, which "are like electric vehicles were 10 years ago. EVs are for real consumers, no strings attached. With EVs you have a lot of infrastructure in place.&lt;ref&gt;Scauzillo, Steve. [http://www.trentonian.com/lifestyle/20131123/la-auto-show-drives-new-green-car-market "L.A. Auto Show drives new green-car market"], ''The Trentonian'', November 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Business Insider]]'', in 2013 commented that if the energy to produce hydrogen "does not come from renewable sources, then fuel-cell cars are not as clean as they seem. ... Gas stations need to invest in the ability to refuel hydrogen tanks before FCEVs become practical, and it's unlikely many will do that while there are so few customers on the road today. ... Compounding the lack of infrastructure is the high cost of the technology. Fuel cells are "still very, very expensive", even compared to battery-powered EVs.&lt;ref name=Davies1/&gt;

{{see also|Television antenna}}
An '''Indoor antenna''' is a type of [[radio antenna|radio]] or [[Television antenna|TV antenna]] placed indoors, as opposed to being mounted on the roof. These days, indoor antennas are a common solution for [[cord cutting]], and there are a variety of commercial options.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.storenano.com/what-is-the-best-dtv-antenna/&lt;/ref&gt;  They are usually considered a simple and cheap solution that may work well when the receiver is relatively near to the broadcasting transmitter and the building walls do not shield the [[radio waves]] too much.

Being close to other [[electric]] or electronic equipment in the building, an indoor antenna is prone to picking up more electrical noise that may interfere with a clear (analog) reception.  Used for digital broadcast, the noise is less of a factor, which recently makes this type of antenna a more popular solution.

[[Image:SAW device.png|right|thumb|250px|Schematic picture of a typical SAW signal processing device containing two interdigital transducers.]]

An '''interdigital transducer''' (IDT) is a device that consists of two interlocking comb-shaped arrays of metallic electrodes (in the fashion of a zipper). These metallic electrodes are deposited on the surface of a [[piezoelectric]] [[Wafer (electronics)|substrate]], such as [[quartz]] or [[lithium niobate]], to form a periodic structure.

IDTs primary function is to convert electric signals to [[surface acoustic wave]]s (SAW) by generating periodically distributed mechanical forces via piezoelectric effect (an input transducer). The same principle is applied to the conversion of SAW back to electric signals (an output transducer). These processes of generation and reception of SAW can be used in different types of SAW signal processing devices, such as band pass filters, delay lines, resonators, sensors, etc. IDT was first proposed by [[Richard M. White]] and Voltmer in 1965.

The '''scanning laser vibrometer''' or '''scanning [[laser Doppler vibrometer]]''', introduced in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Stoffregen, B., Felske, A., “Scanning Laser Doppler Analysis System,” SAE Paper No. 850327, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;, is  an instrument for rapid non-contact measurement and imaging of vibration.&lt;ref name="Chang1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=Fu-Kuo|title=Structural Health Monitoring: The Demands and Challenges : Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring: the Demands and Challenges, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, September 12-14, 2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltQiOaC6qGIC&amp;pg=PA936|accessdate=24 May 2013|year=1999|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566768818|pages=936–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Righini2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Righini|first=Giancarlo C.|title=An Introduction to Optoelectronic Sensors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dR8sT-bTKSEC&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=24 May 2013|date=2009-01-08|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789812834133|pages=220–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fields where they are applied include [[automotive]], [[medical]], [[aerospace]], micro system and [[information technology]] as well as for quality and production control. The optimization of [[vibration]] and [[acoustics|acoustic]] behavior are important goals of product development in all of these fields because they are often among the key characteristics that determine a product’s success in the market. They are also in widespread use throughout many universities conducting basic and applied research in areas that include [[structural dynamics]], [[modal analysis]], acoustic optimization and [[non-destructive evaluation]].

The operating principle is based on the [[Doppler effect]], which occurs when light is back-scattered from a vibrating surface.   Both velocity and displacement can be determined by analyzing the optical signals in different ways. A scanning laser [[vibrometer]] integrates computer-controlled X,Y scanning mirrors and a video camera inside an optical head.  The laser is scanned point-by-point over the test object’s surface to provide a large number of very high spatial resolution measurements.  This sequentially measured vibration data can be used to calculate and visualize animated deflection shapes in the relevant frequency bands from [[frequency domain]] analysis. Alternatively, data can be acquired in the [[time domain]] to, for example, generate animations showing [[wave propagation]] across structures.  In contrast to contact measuring methods, the test object is unaffected by the vibration measuring process.
 
Today, vibrometry covers a huge range of applications such as the study of [[microstructure]]s moving only a few pm at frequencies up to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz, all the way up to the intense dynamics occurring in [[Formula 1]] engines with vibration velocities approaching 30&amp;nbsp;m/s.

A 3D scanning vibrometer combines three optical sensors that accurately detect dynamic movement from different directions in space in order to completely determine the 3D vectors of motion. The software allows each individual x-, y- or z-direction component to be displayed independently, or combined into a single representation. Data can be exported for [[finite element]] [[model validation]] at nodes previously imported from the model for scan grid definition.

In iron and steel [[metallurgy]], '''ledeburite''' is a mixture of 4.3% carbon in iron and is a [[eutectic]] mixture of [[austenite]] and [[cementite]]. Ledeburite is not a type of [[steel]] as the carbon level is too high although it may occur as a separate constituent in some high carbon steels. It is mostly found with cementite or [[pearlite]] in a range of cast irons.

It is named after the [[metallurgist]] [[Karl Heinrich Adolf Ledebur]] (1837–1906). He was the first [[professor]] of metallurgy at the [[Bergakademie Freiberg]] and discovered ledeburite in 1882.

Ledeburite arises when the carbon content is between 2.06% and 6.67%. The eutectic mixture of austenite and cementite is 4.3% carbon, Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C:2Fe, with a melting point of 1147&amp;nbsp;°C.

Ledeburite-II (at ambient temperature) is composed of cementite-I with recrystallized secondary cementite (which separates from austenite as the metal cools) and (with slow cooling) of pearlite. The pearlite results from the [[eutectoid]]al decay of the austenite that comes from the ledeburite-I at 723&amp;nbsp;°C. During more rapid cooling, [[bainite]] can develop instead of pearlite, and with very rapid cooling [[martensite]] can develop.

'''Linear (or Longitudinal) Timecode''' ('''LTC''') is an [[encoding]] of [[SMPTE timecode]] data in an [[audio signal]], as defined in SMPTE 12M specification. The [[Sound reproduction|audio]] signal is commonly recorded on a [[VTR]] track or other storage media.  The bits are encoded using the [[biphase mark code]] (also known as ''FM''):  a 0 bit has a single transition at the start of the bit period.  A 1 bit has two transitions, at the beginning and middle of the period.  This encoding is [[self-clocking]]. Each frame is terminated by a '[[sync word]]' which has a special predefined [[synchronization|sync]] relationship with any [[video]] or [[telecine|film]] content.

A special bit in the linear timecode frame, the ''biphase mark correction'' bit, ensures that there are an even number of AC transitions in each timecode frame.

The sound of linear timecode is a jarring and distinctive noise and has been used as a sound-effects shorthand to imply ''telemetry'' or ''computers''.

==Generation and Distribution==
In broadcast video situations, the LTC generator should be tied into house black burst, as should all devices using timecode, '''to ensure correct color framing and correct synchronization of all digital clocks.''' When synchronizing multiple clock-dependent digital devices together with video, such as digital audio recorders, the devices must be connected to a common word clock signal that is derived from the house black burst signal. This can be accomplished by using a generator that generates both black burst and video-resolved word clock, or by synchronizing the master digital device to video, and synchronizing all subsequent devices to the word clock output of the master digital device (and to LTC).

Made up of 80 bits per frame, where there may be 24, 25 or 30 frames per second, LTC timecode varies from 960&amp;nbsp;Hz (binary zeros at 24 frames/s) to 2400&amp;nbsp;Hz (binary ones at 30 frames/s), and thus is comfortably in the audio frequency range. LTC can exist as either a balanced or unbalanced signal, and can be treated as an audio signal in regards to distribution. Like audio, LTC can be distributed by standard audio wiring, connectors, distribution amplifiers, and patchbays, and can be ground-isolated with audio transformers.  It can also be distributed via 75 ohm video cable and video distribution amplifiers, although the voltage attenuation caused by using a 75 ohm system may cause the signal to drop to a level that can not be read by some equipment.

Care has to be taken with analog audio to avoid audible 'breakthrough' (aka "crosstalk") from the LTC track to the audio tracks.

'''LTC care''':

*Avoid percussive sounds close to LTC
*Never process an LTC with noise reduction, eq or compressor
*Allow pre roll and post roll
*To create negative time code add one hour to time (avoid ''midnight effect'')
*Always put slowest device as a master

Longitudinal SMPTE timecode should be played back at a middle-level when recorded on an audio track, as both low and high levels will introduce distortion.

==Longitudinal timecode data format==

The basic format is an 80-bit code that gives the time of day to the second, and the frame number within the second.  Values are stored in [[binary-coded decimal]], least significant bit first.
There are thirty-two bits of user data, usually used for a reel number and date.

* Bit 10 is set to 1 if [[SMPTE time code#Drop frame timecode|drop frame]] numbering is in use; frame numbers 0 and 1 are skipped during the first second of every minute, except multiples of 10 minutes.  This converts 30 frame/second time code to the 29.97 frame/second [[NTSC]] standard.
* Bit 11, the [[color framing]] bit, is set to 1 if the time code is synchronized to a color video signal.  The frame number modulo 2 (for NTSC and [[SECAM]]) or modulo 4 (for [[PAL]]) should be preserved across cuts in order to avoid phase jumps in the [[chrominance subcarrier]].
* Bits 27, 43, and 59 differ between 25 frame/s time code, and other frame rates (30, 29.97, or 24).{{r|BR.780-2|p=9}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |mode=cs1 |title=Indian Standard IS: 12429 (Part 1) Time and Control Code for Video Tape Recorders: Part 1 Longitudinal Time Code (LTC) |year=2002 |orig-year=1988 |publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]] |pages=1–3 |url=https://law.resource.org/pub/in/bis/S04/is.12429.1.1988.pdf}}  This is an example of the 25 frame/s bit assignments, which are different from the more commonly seen 30/29.97/24 bit assignments.&lt;/ref&gt;  The bits are:
** "Polarity correction bit" (bit 59 at 25 frame/s, bit 27 at other rates): this bit is chosen to provide an even number of 0 bits in the whole frame, including the sync code.  (Since the frame is an even number of bits long, this implies an even number of 1 bits, and is thus an [[even parity]] bit.  Since the sync code includes an odd number of 1 bits, it is an odd parity bit over the data.)  This keeps the phase of each frame consistent, so it always starts with a rising edge at the beginning of bit 0.  This allows seamless splicing of different time codes, and lets it be more easily read with an [[oscilloscope]].&lt;!--It is NOT needed to ensure zero DC bias; biphase encoding takes care of that.--&gt;
** "Binary group flag" bits BGF0 and BGF2 (bits 27 and 43 at 25 frame/s, bits 43 and 59 at other rates): these indicate the format of the user bits.  Both 0 indicates no (or unspecified) format.  Only BGF0 set indicates four 8-bit characters (transmitted [[little-endian]]).  The combinations with BGF2 set are reserved.{{r|BR.780-2|p=7–8}}
* Bit 58, unused in earlier versions of the specification, is now defined as "binary group flag 1" and indicates that the time code is synchronized to an external clock.{{r|BR.780-2|p=7}}  if zero, the time origin is arbitrary.
* The sync pattern in bits 64 through 79 includes 12 consecutive 1 bits, which cannot appear anywhere else in the time code.  Assuming all user bits are set to 1, the longest run of 1 bits that can appear elsewhere in the time code is 10, bits 9 to 18 inclusive.
* The sync pattern is preceded by 00 and followed by 01.  This is used to determine whether an audio tape is running forward or backward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SMPTR Made Simple |publisher=TimeLine Vista, Inc. |year=1996 |page=11 |url=http://faculty.spokanefalls.edu/InetShare/AutoWebs/steveg/SmpteMadeSimple.pdf |quote=The time code reader uses the direction sense bits to determine whether the tape is running forward or backward.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Synchronisation and SMPTE timecode (time code) |first=Phil |last=Rees |date=15 November 2013 |url=http://www.philrees.co.uk/articles/timecode.htm |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="182673">This is a '''list of [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s''' (UAVs, or 'drones'), '''of [[China]]'''. There are further categories and sub-categories following the main, comprehensive list, and some of the UAVs appear in more than one category/ sub-category when they can be classified by more than one. As late of 2010, there are more than a hundred UAV developers/manufacturers currently in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ifeng.com/mil/2/detail_2010_09/06/2441670_2.shtml Chinese UAV industry]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, that number is increased to over two hundred thirty UAV developers / manufacturers in China, with over two third of them are private enterprises (PE), and the remaining are [[government-owned corporation|government owned enterprises]] (GOE). Most of the GOEs are fully capable of indigenously completing the entire development of UAVs of various sizes, from the initial design at the very beginning, all the way to the final completion of UAVs of various sizes, ranging from the smallest [[micro air vehicle]] (MAV)s to the largest UAVs. In contrast, most PEs lack such capability because they are assemblers purchasing existing [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) subsystems such as airframes, flight control systems (FCS) and propulsion systems and integrating these subsystems together into final products of their own. Compounded with transparency and language hurdles, this often creates confusion among observers and analysts outside Chinese because the same UAV appears to be shown by different firms, while in reality, the only thing common is the COTS airframe chosen by different firms, which choose different COTS for other subsystems when assembling UAV of their own. For those PEs do have the full capability to indigenously completing the entire development of UAVs, their products are often limited to unmanned [[blimp]]/[[airship]]s, unmanned [[helicopter]]s/[[multirotor]]s and [[micro air vehicle]] (MAV)s, which consist of the majority of Chinese UAVs. The Chinese UAV market is projected to be [[Renminbi|¥]] 10 billion in 2015,&lt;ref name="Chinese UAV market"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.carnoc.com/list/275/275541.html | title=Chinese UAV market in 2015 | accessdate=Mar 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and within next two decades, it is expected to increase to [[Renminbi|¥]] 46 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.carnoc.com/list/287/287417.html Chinese UAV market in next 20 years]&lt;/ref&gt; As the end of 2013, there are over fifteen thousand UAVs operating in China in the civilian sector alone.&lt;ref name="Chinese UAV market"/&gt;

== Unmanned helicopters ==
This is a list of unmanned [[helicopter]]s of [[China|the People's Republic of China]] from the main list above, excluding unmanned [[Coaxial rotors|coaxial helicopters]], which are listed separately in their own subcategory. Unmanned helicopters consist of a significant portion of Chinese UAVs and most of these Chinese unmanned helicopters are developed as a direct result of an incident in 2007, when Japanese government arrested three officials of [[Yamaha Motor Company]] in early 2007 for exporting nine Yamaha unmanned helicopters to China in 2005, allegedly could be converted to military application from its original crop dusting role. This alleged charge is denied by both Yamaha and China, and Yahama has claimed that these unmanned helicopters only have a range of only 200 meters, or 656 feet, from the person who is controlling them and are therefore unlikely to be used to carry weapons of mass destruction, but the Japanese government nonetheless pressed charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/23/business/worldbusiness/23iht-yamaha.4698914.html Japanese unmanned helicopters export to China]&lt;/ref&gt; The action of Japanese government triggered a massive Chinese response in a nationwide effort to develop domestic Chinese unmanned helicopters to replace those imported from Japan, including the rapid acceleration of existing unmanned helicopters programs in China. The massive nationwide effort has resulted in more than a hundred domestic Chinese unmanned helicopters, most of which are completed by integrating existing [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) airframes with COTS [[autopilot]]s and flight control systems (FCS). Eventually these Chinese unmanned helicopters evolved into models with all subsystems such airframe and flight control systems indigenously developed in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docin.com/p-678685125.html China develop its own unmanned helicopter]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neenah Foundry''' is a manufacturing company in the [[East North Central States|north central]] [[United States]], based in [[Neenah, Wisconsin]]. The company manufactures [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] [[iron]] [[manhole cover]]s, [[grating]]s, and similar items for municipal and construction applications. '''Neenah Enterprises, Inc.''' manufactures iron castings for the heavy truck, agriculture, construction, and related markets.

==History==
Neenah Foundry was established {{Years or months ago|1872}} in 1872 by William Aylward, Sr., as Aylward Plow Works.&lt;ref name="NFhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfco.com/about-us/history/ |title=History |publisher=Neenah Foundry |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was changed to Aylward and Sons in 1904 and to Neenah Foundry Co. in 1922.&lt;ref name="NFhistory"/&gt; In 2003, the company filed for [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foundry Products: Competitive Conditions in the U.S. Market |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=United States International Trade Commission |series=Investigation No. 332-460; USITC Publication No. 3771 |year=2005 |pages=3–8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nip_BrF__5YC&amp;pg=SA3-PA8 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the foundry's parent company again filed for and emerged from bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Neenah Foundry owner emerges from bankruptcy |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date=2010-07-30 |url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/99633179.html |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Organic clothing''' is clothing made from materials raised in or grown in compliance with [[Organic agriculture|organic agricultural]] standards.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Organic clothing may be composed of [[Cotton]], [[Jute]], [[Silk]], [[Ramie]], or [[Wool]]. Textiles do not need to be 100% organic to use the organic label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy Memorandum|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/NOP-PM-11-14-LabelingofTextiles.pdf|publisher=USDA (May 20 2011)|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more general term is ''organic textiles'', which includes both apparel and home textiles. The technical requirements in terms of certification and origin generally remain same for organic clothing and organic textiles.

'''PCell''' stands for '''parameterized cell''', a concept used widely in the automated design of [[Analogue electronics|analog]] [[integrated circuit]]s. A PCell represents a part or a component of the circuit whose structure is dependent on one or more parameters. Hence, it is a [[Cell (EDA)|cell]] which is automatically generated by [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) software based on the values of these parameters. For example, one can create a [[transistor]] PCell and then use different instances of the same with different user defined lengths and widths.&lt;ref name=cadence&gt;{{cite web|title=Cadence reference manual|url=ftp://ftp.sitsemi.ru/pub/Cadence/pcellref.pdf|accessdate=2015-01-09}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vendors of EDA software sometimes use different names for the concept of parameterized cells, e.g. ''T-Cell'' and ''Magic Cell''.&lt;ref name=barr&gt;{{cite book|last=Barr |first=Keith |title=ASIC Design in the Silicon Sandbox: A Complete Guide to Building Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuits |publisher=McGraw Hill Professional |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
In electronic circuit designs, [[Cell (EDA)|cells]] are basic units of functionality.  A given cell may be [[Placement (EDA)|placed]] or instantiated many times.  A PCell is more flexible than a non-parameterized cell because different instances may have different parameter values and, therefore, different structures. For example, rather than having many different cell definitions to represent the variously sized transistors in a given design, a single PCell may take a transistor's dimensions (width and length) as parameters.  Different instances of a single PCell can then represent transistors of different sizes, but otherwise similar characteristics.

The structures within an integrated circuit and the rules ([[Design rule checking|design rules]]) governing their physical dimensions are often complex, thereby making the structures tedious to draw by hand. By using PCells a circuit designer can easily generate a large number of various structures that only differ in a few parameters, thus increasing design productivity and consistency.

Most often, PCell implies a ''physical PCell'', i.e., a physical representation of an electronic component describing its physical structure inside an [[integrated circuit]] (IC). Although most PCells are physical PCells, device symbols in [[Schematic capture|circuit schematics]] may also be implemented as PCells.

Underlying characteristics of all PCells are a dependence on (input) parameters and the ability to generate design data based on these parameters.

== Implementation ==
A PCell is a piece of programming code. This code is responsible for the process of creating the proper structure of the PCell variants based on its (input) parameters. For the example of a physical PCell, this code generates (draws) the actual shapes of the [[Integrated Circuit Layout|mask design]] that comprise the circuit.

Since one piece of PCell code can create many different objects (with different parameter values), it is referred to as a ''PCell Master''. The object/shapes/data that this code creates is called an ''instance'' of the ''PCell''. Typically, one Master PCell produces many instances/variants. This is not only helpful during design entry and specification but also in reducing memory resources required to represent the design data.

== Generation ==
Although the programming language in which a PCell is written is not of importance, [[Cadence SKILL|SKILL]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are most often used to write PCell's code. Alternatively, PCells can be generated using a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI)&lt;ref name=tanner&gt;{{cite web|title=Tanner EDA: L-Edit T-Cell Builder|url=http://www.engineeringtv.com/video/Tanner-EDA-L-Edit-T-Cell-Builde|accessdate=2015-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or specialized PCell design tools based on a library of predefined functions.&lt;ref name=cadence /&gt;

[[File:Photo Studio - 22 Feb. 2011.jpg|thumb|300px|A photographic studio]]
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het interieur van de fotostudio Stafhell &amp; Kleingrothe in Medan. TMnr 60001724.jpg|thumb|right|Stafhell &amp; Kleingrothe photo studio in 1898]]
A '''photographic studio''' (also known as a '''photography studio''' or '''photo studio''') is a workspace to take, develop, print and duplicate [[photography|photographs]]. Photographic training and the display of finished photographs may also be accommodated in a photographic studio. The studio may have a [[darkroom]], storage space, a studio proper where photographs are taken, a display room and space for other related work.

A photographic studio is often a business owned and represented by one or more photographers, possibly accompanied by assistants and pupils, who create and sell their own and sometimes others’ photographs.

Since the early years of the 20th century the business functions of a photographic studio have increasingly been called a “photographic agency,” leaving the term “photographic studio” to refer almost exclusively to the workspace.

The history of photographic studios and photography dates back to 19th century with the first camera. The earliest photographic studios made use of painters' lighting techniques to create photographic portraits.  During that era the nothing was better than the sunlight with open window as the primary source of light of painters. Photographic studios started using flashes in 1840. However, not everyone could afford it as they were quite expensive and dangerous. These flashes were also known as 'hot lights' and could have exploded. By 1860s they were in common use in professional studios. 'Tungsten Lights' or 'Hot Lights' were still in use. In around 70s even smaller studios got access to flash lights or [[Strobe light|strobes]].

People tried many things from time to time when setting up studios to cope up with different hurdles in photography. However lighting was a big hurdle. Flash powder was the first means of artificial lighting that allowed to produce sufficient brightness to capture the action of the film . However this industry developed at a faster rate. With advancement in camera lenses, lighting and other techniques and equipment, studio photography gained hold and it became quite easier to produce images within a studio.

The first commercial use of photography was in the production of portraits. Photography replaced painting completely by 40s. with fully equipped studios in existence. The photography process was much shorter and simple as compared to painting, in which the subject and even the painter used to suffer.

[[Calotype|'Calotypes']] was introduced in 1840s. With the introduction of calotypes the production of negative enabled the photographers to print as many copies as customer required, hence strengthening the very base for the studios. In 1850s small portraits called [[Ambrotype|'Ambrotypes']] were being produced. The exposure time varied between 2 and 20 seconds in comparison to 8 hr long exposure when the first still portrait photograph was takenin 1826. With the time passing by, saw the advancement in the photography. However, trick photography has always been around from as long as photography is. Trick photography was later replaced by Photoshop.

It became easy and cheap to set up the photographic studios. Modern studios are equipped with new age lighting, gears and technology. They are capable of producing high quality images in bulk. From the past 15 years the studio setup has changed drastically and still getting more digital.

'''Plan Calcul''' was a French governmental program to promote a national or European [[computer]] industry and associated research and education activities.

The plan was approved in July 1966 by President [[Charles de Gaulle]], in the aftermath of two key events that made his government worry about French dependence on the US computer industry.&lt;ref name=bi89/&gt; In the mid-1960s, the United States denied export licenses for American-made [[IBM]] and [[Control Data Corporation|CDC]] computers to the French [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique]] in order to prevent it from perfecting its [[H bomb]].&lt;ref name=bi89/&gt;&lt;ref name=ws/&gt;&lt;ref name=bg07/&gt;{{rp|21}} Meanwhile, in 1964, [[General Electric]] had acquired a majority of [[Groupe Bull|Compagnie des Machines Bull]], the largest French computer manufacturer, which had the second highest market share in France, after IBM, and was a leading IT equipment maker in Europe. Following this partial takeover,&lt;ref name=fc/&gt; known as "Affaire Bull",&lt;ref name=c04/&gt; GE-Bull dropped two Bull computers from its product line.&lt;ref name=ws/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Mounier-Kuhn, “From General Electric to Bull: A case of managerial knowledge transfer (1956-1970)”, ''Entreprises et Histoire'', June 2014, n° 75, p. 42-56 (http://www.cairn.info/revue-entreprises-et-histoire-2014-2-page-42.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsibility for administering the plan was given to a newly created government agency, ''Délégation à l'informatique'', answering directly to the prime minister.&lt;ref name=ws/&gt;

As part of the program, in December 1966, the ''[[Compagnie internationale pour l'informatique]]'' (CII) was established as a manufacturer of commercial and [[scientific computer]]s, initially under licence from Scientific Data Systems. The new company was intended to compete not only in the process control and military market, where its staff was already seasoned, but also in the office computing sector of the French market, where IBM and Bull were dominant at the time.&lt;ref name=bi89/&gt; The plan enacted government subsidies for CII between 1967 and 1971, and was reconducted for another four years.&lt;ref name=f88/&gt; A minor side of the plan was devoted to peripherals, while CII's main parent company, Thomson-CSF, received government support to develop its semiconductor plants and R &amp; D. Overall, while CII mainframes benefitted from preferential procurement by the French government, the Plan Calcul left peripherals, components and small computers makers compete on the free market. The same went for software companies, which were already thriving in France.

On the research side, the program also led to the creation of ''L'Institut de recherche en informatique et en automatique'' (IRIA) in 1967, which later became [[INRIA]].&lt;ref name=fc/&gt; It was accompanied with a vast educational effort in programming and computer science.&lt;ref name=mk/&gt;

In the late 1960s, CII shipped its new, internally designed mainframes ([[Iris 50]] and [[Iris 80]]), and developed a mini-computer, [[Mitra 15]], which became a commercial success in the following decade. The company also produced competitive magnetic peripherals in cooperation with [[Control Data Corporation|CDC]].

In 1971, CII began negotiations with [[Siemens]] and [[Philips]] to form a joint European company, Unidata, which shipped its first computers in 1974. Yet a new President of the Republic was elected then, former Finance minister [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing|Giscard d'Estaing]], who was a strong opponent of the Plan Calcul; meanwhile, CII's sleeping partner, CGE-Alcatel, woke up to oppose the domination of its archrival Siemens over the European computer industry. Unidata was terminated and CII was absorbed into [[Groupe Bull|Honeywell-Bull]] in 1976.

The '''Remote Sensing Center''' (RSC) at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] was established to bring together a range of capabilities and expertise to address problems of military and intelligence importance, as well as environmental and civil concerns.  It is specialized in a variety of [[remote sensing]] technologies designed to enable people to look beyond the range of human vision in range or in spectral perception.

== Mission ==

Members of the RSC come from the [[physics]], electrical and computer engineering, computer science, [[meteorology]], and [[oceanography]] departments.  They are collaborating to develop new remote sensing systems, as well as use and exploit current systems in air and space.  It is part of a larger activity in the [[Monterey Bay]] area that provides expertise in topical areas outside the technical disciplines available at NPS.

The Naval Postgraduate School, and specifically the Remote Sensing Center, has the ability to handle classified data, as well as access to a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) that is fully equipped with comms, storage, and processing capabilities.  The RSC has pre-established cooperative research with government, academia, and industry in the remote sensing sector ranging from local to international partners.  Highly experienced military officers, intelligence analysts, and faculty are a critical part of the NPS research staff.

==Projects==

=== Lidar ===
''[[Lidar]]'' (LIght raDAR) works as an optical analog to [[radar]] in the visible spectrum of light with advantages related to the smaller wavelengths of the laser pulse.  Lidar ranges in wavelength from ultra-violet (0.3-0.45&amp;nbsp;µm) to visible (0.45-0.70&amp;nbsp;µm) to the infrared (1-15&amp;nbsp;µm).  Lidar can detect much smaller particles than radar in the atmosphere (which cannot detect things smaller than cloud particles), and thus can be used for aerosol detection.

The raw form of data is a set of x,y,z coordinate points.  With recent advances, resolution has improved dramatically.  Raw data can be processed to remove unwanted areas or features.  Outputs such as topographic maps with contour lines can also be derived from lidar.  Programs to manipulate lidar data include ENVI, [[ERDAS IMAGINE]], [[ArcInfo]], and [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] ArcView (with 3D analyst ext.)  One useful derivation of lidar data is the DEM ([[Digital Elevation Model]]). DEMs are displayed in a raster format with a matrix.  The DEM has a specified cell size that corresponds to the earth’s surfaces.  The cell contains the average elevation of the points within it. 

The Remote Sensing Center is planning research projects that undertake the modeling and testing of analytical processing and using more fieldwork to obtain ground-truth measurements.  Projects have been completed and are currently underway in terrain classification including [[Elkhorn Slough]] and hidden trail identification.  Other future projects include a collaboration with the MOdeling, Virtual Environments, and Simulation (MOVES) institute on lidar standards for data structure and visualization tools and modeling new lidar analysis tools.

=== Spectral Imagery Analysis ===

Spectral imagery measures the spectral character of materials within the visible range and beyond.  Two objects may appear visually identical but may be distinguished through examination of their spectral properties.  Computer software can use a color scheme to make them visible.

A subset of spectral imagery, [[hyperspectral imaging]] data, is produced when "solar electromagnetic energy reflected from the earth's surface is dispersed into many contiguous narrow spectral bands by an airborne spectrometer" (Stefanou, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;2). Our current research and projects include environmental mapping, target detection, and change detection.

The Remote Sensing Center works with airborne and satellite systems including [[IKONOS]]/[[Quickbird]] [[multispectral imagery]] (MSI), and airborne hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems including [[AVIRIS]], HYDICE, CASI, and HYMAP.  Classification and analysis, including atmospheric compensation is performed using standard industry research tools; notably ENVI and ERDAS Imagine.  The RSC has acquired a [[polarimetry|polarimetric]] camera for expanding experimentation in the visible spectrum.

==Intelligence==
The Remote Sensing Center benefits from the secure facilities at NPS.  Having the ability to process classified data with an on-site, fully equipped Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) allows students and faculty to pursue lines of research and work with technologies unavailable to the public.

The sustained efforts of fully funded graduate students, both military and civilian with an average of eight to ten years of field experience, have conducted research in an array of topics related to remote sensing.

*Current projects include:
:Helicopter Brownout (terrain classification) using National Technical Means (NTM)
:Maritime Domain Awareness (ASW)

'''RemoveDEBRIS''' is a satellite research project intending to demonstrate various [[space debris]] removal technologies. The satellite's platform was manufactured by [[Surrey Satellite Technology]] Ltd (SSTL) and is a variant of the SSTL X50 series. Partners on the project include [[Airbus]], [[ArianeGroup]], [[Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology]], [[Inria]], [[Innovative Solutions In Space]], [[Surrey Space Centre]], and [[Stellenbosch University]].

==Mission overview==
Rather than engaging in active debris removal (ADR) of real space debris, the RemoveDEBRIS mission plan is to test the efficacy of several ADR technologies on mock targets in [[low Earth orbit]]. In order to complete its planned experiments the platform is equipped with a net, a harpoon, a laser ranging instrument, a dragsail, and two [[CubeSat]]s (miniature research satellites).&lt;ref name="sfn20180401"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Stephen|title=Eliminating space junk could take step toward reality with station cargo launch|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/04/01/eliminating-space-junk-could-take-step-toward-reality-with-station-cargo-launch/|accessdate=6 April 2018|work=Spaceflight Now|date=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments are as follows:
* Net experiment - One of the CubeSats, called DebrisSat 1, will deploy a balloon meant to simulate a piece of space debris. From a short distance away, the RemoveDEBRIS satellite will attempt to capture the debris in a net and then manoeuvre this package to fall into Earth's atmosphere and burn up.&lt;ref name="sfn20180401"/&gt;
* Vision-based navigation - The other CubeSat, called DebrisSat 2, will be released and the RemoveDEBRIS satellite will undergo a series of manoeuvres in order to obtain data and images using both [[lidar]] and [[optical camera]]s.&lt;ref name="sfn20180401"/&gt;
* Harpoon and deployable target - A harpoon connected by a tether will be fired at a plate attached to an arm extending from the RemoveDEBRIS platform itself.
* Dragsail - After the conclusion of the other experiments the satellite will deploy a large sail, which will act in a similar fashion to an [[air brake (aeronautics)|air brake]]. The dragsail will bring RemoveDEBRIS from the relatively low orbital altitude of the space station into the planet's atmosphere to safely disintegrate.

==Timeline==
RemoveDEBRIS was launched aboard the [[SpaceX Dragon]] spacecraft on 2 April 2018 as part of the [[SpaceX CRS-14|CRS-14]] mission, arriving at the [[ISS]] on 4 April.&lt;ref name="sfn20180404"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2018/04/04/dragon-cargo-capsule-reaches-space-station-for-second-time/ |title=Dragon cargo capsule reaches space station for second time |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=4 April 2018 |accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deployment of the satellite from the station's [[Kibo (ISS module)|Kibo module]] via robotic [[Canadarm2|Canadarm-2]] took place on 20 June 2018.&lt;ref name="sfn20180401"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/40960-removedebris-space-junk-cleanup-test-flight.html|title=1st Satellite Built to Harpoon Space Junk for Disposal Begins Test Flight|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; At approximately 100 kg, RemoveDEBRIS is the largest satellite to have ever been deployed from the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geib|first1=Claudia|title=An Experimental Space Junk Collector Is On Its Way to the ISS|url=https://futurism.com/space-junk-collector-launched-iss/https://futurism.com/space-junk-collector-launched-iss/|accessdate=6 April 2018|work=Futurism|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full lifespan of the mission from launch to re-entry is estimated at 1.5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RemoveDEBRIS|url=https://www.surrey.ac.uk/surrey-space-centre/missions/removedebris|publisher=University of Surrey|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most chapters are in the United States, but STC includes members from 14 countries.&lt;ref name=communities/&gt; The largest group outside the U.S. is the chapter in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.

STC publishes a quarterly journal, ''Technical Communication'', and a monthly magazine, ''Intercom''.

==History==
The organization traces its roots to the Society of Technical Writers (STW) in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and the Association of Technical Writers and Editors (ATWE) in [[New York, New York|New York]]. Both were founded in the [[United States]] in 1953. These organizations merged in 1957 to form the Society of Technical Writers and Editors (STWE). In 1960, this group merged with the Technical Publishing Society (TPS), based in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]],  to become the Society of Technical Writers and Publishers. In 1971, the organization's name was changed to the Society for Technical Communication.

The organization's main journal developed from the ''TWE Journal'' to the ''STWE Review'' to the ''STWP Review'' to ''Technical Communications'' to ''[[Technical Communication (journal)|Technical Communication]]''. Editors of this journal have included Douglas E. Knight, Allan H. Lytel, A. Stanley Higgins, Frank R. Smith, George Hayhoe, and Menno de Jong.

Other important leaders in the history of STC include Robert T. Hamlett (first president of ATWE), A. E. Tyler (first president of TPS), Samuel A. Miles (president of the Society of Technical Writers and Editors, which became ATWE's New York chapter in 1955), Vernon R. Root, Robert O. Shockney, and Stello Jordan. In 2011, Alan Houser was elected vice president of the organization; per their by-laws, he became president in 2012, and was succeeded by his own vice president Nicky Bleiel in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Al Martine, [http://techwhirl.com/interesting-times-challenges-and-opportunities-for-technical-communication/ Interesting Times: Challenges and Opportunities for Technical Communication]. Tech Whirl, May 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

STC's annual publications competition for 2012-2013 was held in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energetics.com/news/Pages/01-31-2013-article1.aspx Four Energetics Products Win Society for Technical Communication Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130629030010/http://www.energetics.com/news/Pages/01-31-2013-article1.aspx |date=2013-06-29 }}. [[VSE Corporation]], 1/31/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also has branches internationally. On November 12, 2012, STC's branch in India held its 14th annual conference in [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://buildacloud.org/about-diy-cloud-computing/cloud-events/viewevent/137-14th-society-for-technical-communication-stc-india-annual-conference.html 14th Society for Technical Communication (STC) India Annual Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518155756/http://buildacloud.org/about-diy-cloud-computing/cloud-events/viewevent/137-14th-society-for-technical-communication-stc-india-annual-conference.html |date=2013-05-18 }} at Build A Cloud.

'''Sodium azide''' is the [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This colorless [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] is the gas-forming component in many car [[airbag]] systems.  It is used for the preparation of other [[azide]] compounds. It is an [[ionic compound|ionic]] substance, is highly soluble in [[water]], and is very acutely toxic.&lt;ref name=Ull/&gt;

==Structure==
Sodium azide is an ionic solid. Two [[Polymorphism (materials science)|crystalline forms]] are known, rhombohedral and hexagonal.&lt;ref name=stevens/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Wells1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both adopt layered structures.  The azide anion is very similar in each form, being [[centrosymmetric]] with N–N distances of 1.18 Å. The {{chem|Na|+}} ion has [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] geometry.  Each azide is linked to six Na+ centers, with three Na-N bonds to each terminal nitrogen center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The crystal structures of lithium, sodium and strontium azides|url = http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S0567740868002062|journal = Acta Crystallographica Section B|date = 1968-02-15|pages = 262–269|volume = 24|issue = 2|doi = 10.1107/s0567740868002062|first = G.

==Preparation==
The common synthesis method is the "[[Johannes Wislicenus|Wislicenus]] process," which proceeds in two steps from ammonia. In the first step, ammonia is converted to [[sodium amide]]:
:2 Na + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The sodium amide is subsequently combined with [[nitrous oxide]]:
:2 NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + NaOH + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
These reactions are the basis of the industrial route, which produced about 250 tons/y in 2004, with production increasing owing to the popularization of [[airbag]]s.&lt;ref name=Ull&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Hydrazoic Acid and Azides|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14356007.a13_193/abstract|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|publisher = Wiley-VCH|year = 2000|isbn = 9783527306732|doi = 10.1002/14356007.a13_193|first = Horst H.|last = Jobelius|first2 = Hans-Dieter|last2 = Scharff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory methods===
Curtius and Thiele developed another production process where a nitrite ester is converted to sodium azide using hydrazine. This method is suited for laboratory preparation of sodium azide:
:2 NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH +H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  → 2 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;ONO + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;ONO + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + NaOH  → NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +  C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Alternatively the salt can be obtained by the reaction of [[sodium nitrate]] with sodium amide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Holleman&amp;Wiberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical reactions ==
Treatment of sodium azide with strong acids gives [[hydrazoic acid]], which is also extremely toxic:

:{{chem|H|+}} + {{chem|N|3|-}} → {{chem|HN|3}}

Aqueous solutions contain minute amounts of [[hydrogen azide]], the formation of which is described by the following equilibrium:

: {{chem|N|3|-}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} {{chem|HN|3}} + {{chem|OH|-}}  (K = 10{{su|p=−4.6}})

Sodium azide can be destroyed by treatment with [[nitrous acid]] solution:&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author = Committee on Prudent Practices for Handling, Storage, and Disposal of Chemicals in Laboratories, Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology, Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications, National Research Council | chapter = Disposal of Waste | title = Prudent Practices in the Laboratory: Handling and Disposal of Chemicals | year = 1995 | page = 165 | publisher = National Academy Press | location = Washington, DC | isbn = 0-309-05229-7 | url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=4911&amp;page=165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: 2 NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NO + 2 NaOH

==Applications==

===Automobile airbags and airplane escape chutes ===
Older [[airbag]] formulations contained mixtures of oxidizers and sodium azide and other agents including ignitors and accelerants. An electronic controller detonates this mixture during an automobile crash:
: 2 NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2Na + 3 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The same reaction occurs upon heating the salt to approximately 300&amp;nbsp;°C. The sodium that is formed is a potential hazard alone and, in automobile airbags, it is converted by reaction with other ingredients, such as [[potassium nitrate]] and [[silica]].  In the latter case, innocuous sodium silicates are generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Betterton, E. A. | title = Environmental Fate of Sodium Azide Derived from Automobile Airbags | journal = Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology | year = 2003 | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 423–458 | doi = 10.1080/10643380390245002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium azide is also used in airplane escape chutes.  Newer generation air bags contain [[nitroguanidine]] or [[guanidine nitrate|similar less sensitive explosives]].

===Organic and inorganic synthesis===
Due to its explosion hazard, sodium azide is of only limited value in industrial scale organic chemistry.  In the laboratory, it is used in [[organic synthesis]] to introduce the azide functional group by displacement of [[halide]]s. The azide functional group can thereafter be converted to an [[amine]] by reduction with either [[Tin(II) chloride|SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in ethanol or [[lithium aluminium hydride]] or a tertiary [[phosphine]], such as [[triphenylphosphine]] in the [[Staudinger reaction]], with [[Raney nickel]] or with [[hydrogen sulfide]] in pyridine.

Sodium azide is a versatile precursor to other inorganic azide compounds, ''e.g.'', [[lead azide]] and [[silver azide]], which are used in explosives.

===Biochemistry and biomedical uses===
Sodium azide is a useful [[probe reagent]] and a [[preservative]].

In hospitals and laboratories, it is a [[biocide]]; it is especially important in bulk reagents and [[stock solution]]s which may otherwise support [[bacterium|bacteria]]l growth where the sodium azide acts as a [[bacteriostatic]] by inhibiting [[cytochrome oxidase]] in [[gram-negative]] bacteria; [[gram-positive]] ([[streptococci]], [[Streptococcus pneumoniae|pneumococci]], [[bacillus|lactobacilli]]) are intrinsically resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lichstein, H.

=== Agricultural uses ===
It is used in [[agriculture]] for pest control of soil-borne pathogens such as ''[[Meloidogyne incognita]]'' or ''[[Helicotylenchus dihystera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Applications of sodium azide for control of soilborne pathogens in potatoes.

It is also used as a [[mutagen]] for crop selection of plants such as rice,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mutagenic Effects of Sodium Azide in Rice1|url = https://www.crops.org/publications/cs/abstracts/20/5/CS0200050663|journal = Crop Science|date = 2000-01-01|volume = 20|issue = 5|doi = 10.2135/cropsci1980.0011183x002000050030x|first = M.

==History==
Steve Peplin, John Talan and Rich Peplin collaborated together to create a manufacturing company in 1986 with a $2,100 investment. They had no manufacturing equipment but landed a customer, contracted out production, and shipped parts.  Upon landing their second customer in the next year 1987, they purchased a Niagara punch press machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ganzer |first1=Tony |title=Could Ohio's Renewable Energy Be A Matter Of National Security? |url=http://radio.wosu.org/post/could-ohios-renewable-energy-be-matter-national-security#stream/0 |website=WOSU-FM |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company started out on Chatfield Ave in the neighborhood of [[West Park, Cleveland]] and moved to Cleveland's [[Detroit-Shoreway]] neighborhood in 1991 In 2006 the company moved into a building formely occupied by [[TRW Inc.]] in Cleveland's [[Collinwood]] Neighborhood.  Each relocation is within the city of Cleveland's urban manufacturing areas and was facilitated by growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Some See Ohio's Renewable Energy Potential As A Matter Of Economic And National Security |url=http://www.ideastream.org/news/why-some-see-ohios-renewable-energy-potential-as-a-matter-of-economic-and-national-security |website=ideastream |language=en |date=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
    
Pete Accorti joined the company as a partner in 1988.  John Talan left the company in 1996.  Talan Products manufactures component parts for medium and large OEM companies across many industries.
In 1993 the company was first recognized for the "green initiatives" it had adopted and Pete Accorti was awarded the "Green Lantern" award by [[Crain Communications]], Crain's Cleveland Business in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Waste test: a passionate manager leads Collinwood's talan products toward its goal of a sustainable stamping plant.(MANNY AWARD WINNER GREEN INITIATIVE) |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-257229023.html |publisher=Inside Business |date=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TiLite''' designs and manufactures titanium and aluminum [[wheelchairs]]. TiLite specializes in wheelchair customization (a process called TiFit) in which each wheelchair is made to users' exact specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jane |last=Sander |url=http://www.kndu.com/story/20200839/pascos-tilite-company-bringing-custom-wheelchairs-to-people-around-the-world |title=Pasco's TiLite company expanding around the globe |location = Yakima, WA |publisher=Kndu.com |date=2012-11-28 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

One of TiLite’s first models to market was called the “CrossSport”. Since then, TiLite has developed a full range of titanium and aluminum wheelchairs.  TiLite wheelchairs are sold in 38 countries; TiLite is a division of TiSport, LLC, which is headquartered in Pasco, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Jason |last=Hagey |url=http://www.washingtonbusinessmag.com/home/176-the_ultimate_ride.htm |title=The Ultimate Ride - How Pasco, Wash. became home to the world’s hottest wheelchair manufacturer |publisher=Washingtonbusinessmag.com |date=Winter 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, TiLite was acquired by Permobil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.permobil.com/en/Corporate/Company/selection/Press-Releases/Permobil-acquires-TiLite|title=Permobil acquires TiLite |accessdate=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

TiLite uses [[titanium]] for the frames of several lines of its high-performance wheelchairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Boninger |first=David |url=http://pvamag.com/pn/article/3633/the_frame_game |title=The Frame Game |work=PN/Paraplegia News |publisher=Pvamag.com |issue=June 2011 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Titanium has the highest strength-to-weight ratio of any metal, it is highly durable, and it absorbs vibrations better than other common frame materials such as aluminum.  These unique properties make it desirable, but because titanium is difficult to refine and requires expertise and precision in welding and bending, it is a more costly material. TiLite makes wheelchairs in both titanium and aluminum. While the company's titanium chairs are slightly lighter in weight and more durable, their aluminum wheelchairs are more economical and sufficient for most users. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Bob |last=Vogel |url=http://newmobility.com/articleView.cfm?id=11711 |title=The Titanium Revolution Revisited |publisher=New Mobility |date=September 2010 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''train inspection system''' is one of various systems of inspection which are essential to maintain the safe running of [[rail transport]].

Because [[safety]] is of high importance when [[railroad car|train cars]] move across the rails, there must be [[inspection]]s. The cars are heavy and have moving parts that can break or become defective. Worn or broken parts can drag, pound, and generally destroy the cars and the [[Track (rail transport)|track]] structure they run on. Parts and [[cargo|loads]] must not extend outside the limits of the car, and there should be no leaking of the cars' contents.

Quality inspections are needed not just before a [[train]] is moved, but also as it travels to its destination.

==Overview==
[[File:HBD DD1.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A hot bearing detector w/ dragging equipment unit]]
There are several levels of inspection on railroad equipment. Inspections are continuous, starting when the car is being built and repeated at regular intervals.

Before the train begins its journey, the [[locomotive]]s and the [[railroad car|cars]] are checked. This is done by mechanical department workers, sometimes [[camera]]s and [[3D scanner|scanners]] are also used. Some of the items certified ''good to go'' are things like the [[braking system]] including hand-brake release, brake application, condition of the air valves, piping and hoses, communication equipment, and many more. Very much like the [[checklist]] an airline might use. When the pretrip work is done, the train is considered safe to move.

Once the movement begins, the train is continuously watched by employees, scanners and monitors. These are sometimes called "in motion defect detectors" or [[defect detector]]s (DD).
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WISE with Bungalow JPG.jpg|right|200px|thumb|WISE Scanner Location]] --&gt;

==Technologies==
As the railroad has evolved from block stations and control towers to a centralized dispatching system, they have also moved to more advanced inspection tools. The technologies in use today vary from a simplistic paddle and switch to infrared [[thermography]], [[3D scanner|laser scanning]], and even [[Ultrasonic testing|ultrasonic audio analysis]]. These devices are used to inspect engines, cars and the loads on them.&lt;ref name="aar-hightech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aar.org/~/media/aar/Background-Papers/High-Tech-Advances.ashx|title=Error|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The systems used on [[North America]]n and other railways fall into a dozen or so major groups, some are listed below.
 
;Wheel impact load detector (WILD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aar.org/~/media/aar/past-events/2011-03-15-NARMO/CN-Wild-History.ashx|title=Error|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lechowicz-hunt"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ntsb.gov/events/symp_rec/proceedings/authors/lechowicz.htm| title=Monitoring and Managing Wheel Condition and Loading| date=May 3–5, 1999| last=Lechowicz| first=Stephen| last2=Hunt| first2=Chris| location=Arlington, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Railway-defect-detectors-sensors.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Sensors for a railway wheel impact load monitor, Lara, Victoria, Australia]]
High impact wheels have some defect where it does not roll smoothly along the track, A flaw in a wheel causes vibrations or banging. This is very destructive to the track structure and the [[rolling stock]].

;Weigh in motion (WIM)
{{main|Weigh in motion}}
Checks for overloads or shifted loads that can be dangerous.&lt;ref name="lechowicz-hunt" /&gt;

;Truck hunting
[[File:Hunting oscillation section ja 150px.gif|right|200px|thumb|Truck hunting]]
Looks for ''[[hunting oscillation]]'' of the [[bogie|trucks]] or [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelset]]; a lateral movement in the [[track gauge|gauge]] of the track, like drifting back and forth in a lane of traffic. This action can increase above a certain speed to the point the wheel flanges impact the rails, potentially causing damage to both. There is also force absorbed by this action that will affect the energy consumption of train operations.

;Truck performance
[[File:Bogie Tracking Behaviour Monitor - TBOGI system.jpg|thumb|Truck hunting and performance detector—TBOGI system]]
Is stiff or poorly steering or axle sets that don't follow the path of the track correctly. Presents itself like 'dog tracking" where the [[Wheelset (rail transport)|trucks]] are biased to run against the flange on one side or the other. Truck performance defects include tracking position and angle of attack on a per-axle basis, as well as rotation, shift, inter-axle misalignment, and tracking error on a per-bogie basis. Truck performance detectors can provide early detection of bogie defects, and early warning of derailment risks through flange climb or rail break.&lt;ref name="The Challenges of Integrating Novel Wayside Rolling Stock Monitoring Technologies: A Case Study"&gt;{{cite paper|last=Bladon|first=Paul|title=The Challenges of Integrating Novel Wayside Rolling Stock Monitoring Technologies: A Case Study|date=2015|publisher=[[International Heavy Haul Association]]|location=Perth, Australia|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/downloads/whitepapers/track/tbogi-bogie/|accessdate=June 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Acoustic bearing detectors
Listens with special [[microphone]]s for internal [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] defects as the equipment moves across the detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/Research/ord0006ii.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527152928/http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/Research/ord0006ii.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atsi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aar.org/~/media/aar/past-events/2011-03-15-NARMO/From-ATSI-to-TDTI.ashx|title=Error|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are very sensitive and can detect problems before the bearing fails.

;High wheel temperature detectors
[[File:Phoenix 2FBOA Kopie.png|right|200px|thumb|Hot box and hot wheel detection system, PHOENIX MB (SST Signal &amp; System Technik GmbH)]]
Look for hot and cold wheels which are generally caused by braking equipment failures.

;Bearing temperature scanners
This type of defect detector uses ultra sensitive [[infrared]] cameras called [[pyrometer]]s. These devices take the [[temperature]] of each bearing as it passes by the scanner. This data is then compared to preset "Alarm limits". If the whole [[consist]] is without problems, the train is passed. If however there is overheating in one or more of the bearings (a [[hot box]]), an alarm is given.

These messages can be by radio to the train crew or might be sent to the [[dispatch center]] for handling. The data is also used to detect a trend over several locations that might predict a future failure. If an alarm is sent, the train is stopped, and either the defect is corrected or the offending car is removed for repair. Many [[derailment]]s are avoided by these devices which is why thousands of them are in use on rail systems across the world.

;Dragging equipment detectors
As the name suggests, they are able to detect things hanging or dragging under the cars. These consist of a series of plates mounted on a pivot shaft. An object hanging or dragging will contact the plates, moving them and breaking a circuit. This will trigger an alarm and alert the crew. Many are stand-alone detectors, but most often are integrated into bearing temperature scanning locations.

;High/wide sensors
[[Image:Lademass EBO.png|thumb| Railway clearance G1 and G2 (Germany)]]
{{see also|structure gauge||loading gauge}}
These are able to measure the height and width of rolling stock, so that cars and loads which won't fit under bridges or through tunnels are stopped. Most often they are optical line of sight devices that trigger an alarm when the beam is broken. They are often seen at a bearing temperature scanning locations, they then report out as part of the detectors regular train inspection report. Mounted on poles or a bridge structure, the optical line is adjusted for a set height and width, it can then send an alarm when something too big to fit the clearance limits ahead passes its view.

;Derailment detector
Is a simple "broken wire" type device that notifies the train crew they are off the track somewhere in their train.

;Pantograph inspection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pantoinspect.com|title=Pantoinspect - Image House|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pantograph inspection scanner.JPG|thumb|An automated scanner inspects the pantograph of a passing train.]]
{{anchor|Pantograph inspection}}A system which monitors the integrity of the [[Pantograph_(rail)|pantograph]].  These are normally based on a [[machine_vision|vision system]] which takes pictures of the pantographs and performs an analysis based on computer vision algorithms.  A pantograph uses a [[graphite|carbon]] strip to conduct electricity between the [[Overhead_line|catenary]] and the [[Pantograph_(rail)|pantograph]].  When these are damaged or worn out, the [[Pantograph_(rail)|pantograph]] can tear down the [[Overhead_line|catenary]] causing [[train]] delays.

;Wheel Profile monitors&lt;ref name="aar-hightech"/&gt;
[[File:WPD Prototype.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A laser wheel profile detector]]
These laser and optical scanning devices make images of the [[flange]] and [[tread]]. These measurements are compared with acceptable dimensions. When worn beyond limits, the wheels are scheduled for replacement. If beyond a safe level the axle set is removed from service.

;Trend monitoring systems
These [[back office]] systems are predictive, finding equipment problems as they start to develop.&lt;ref name="atsi" /&gt;

__NOTOC__
The '''United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States''' was set up under President [[Gerald Ford]] in 1975 to investigate the activities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and other intelligence agencies within the [[United States of America|United States]]. The commission was led by the Vice President, [[Nelson Rockefeller]], and is sometimes referred to as the '''Rockefeller Commission'''.

The commission was created in response to a December 1974 report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s. The commission issued a single report in 1975, touching upon certain [[CIA]] abuses including mail opening and surveillance of domestic dissident groups. It publicized [[Project MKUltra]], a CIA [[mind control]] study.

It also studied issues relating to the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]], specifically the head snap as seen in the [[Zapruder film]] (first shown on television in 1975), and the possible presence of [[E. Howard Hunt]] and [[Frank Sturgis]] in [[Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/contents/church/contents_church_reports_rockcomm.htm Michigan State University Libraries - Electronic Resources&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A larger investigation, the [[Church Committee]], was set up on 27 January 1975 by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. The [[Nedzi Committee]] was created in the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] on 19 February 1975. It was replaced by the [[Pike Committee]] five months later.

In July 1975, ''The New York Times'' reported that unnamed staff sources within the Rockefeller Commission said that [[Sidney Gottlieb]] commanded the [[Project MKUltra|CIA's LSD experimentation program]]&lt;!-- source does not refer to MKULtra by name --&gt;, was personally involved in the experiment that killed researcher [[Frank Olson]], then destroyed the program's records in 1973.&lt;ref name="The New York Times; July 18, 1975"&gt;{{cite news |last=M.

==Natural occurrence==
[[File:UraniumUSGOV.jpg|thumb|Uranium ore]]
[[Uranium]] is a naturally occurring element found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. This is the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth. According to the [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] the normal concentration of uranium in soil is 300&amp;nbsp;μg/kg to 11.7&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications/1993.html |author=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |title=Sources and effects of ionizing radiation : UNSCEAR 1993 Report to the General Assembly, with Scientific Annexes | publisher = [[United Nations]] | isbn = 92-1-142200-0 | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered to be more plentiful than [[antimony]], [[beryllium]], [[cadmium]], [[gold]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[silver]], or [[tungsten]] and is about as abundant as [[tin]], [[arsenic]] or [[molybdenum]]. It is found in many minerals including [[uraninite]] (most common uranium ore), [[autunite]], [[uranophane]], [[torbernite]], and [[coffinite]]. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as [[phosphate]] rock deposits, and minerals such as [[lignite]], and [[monazite]] sands in uranium-rich [[ore]]s (it is recovered commercially from these sources).

[[Seawater]] contains about 3.3 [[parts per billion]] of uranium by weight, approximately (3.3&amp;nbsp;µg/kg) or, 3.3&amp;nbsp;micrograms per [[liter]] of seawater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OeEUcIRsIwAC&amp;pg=PA598&amp;lpg=PA598&amp;dq=Radium+and+thorium+isotopes+in+the+surface+waters+of+the+East+Pacific+and+coastal+southern+California.+Earth+Planet.+Sci.+Lett.,+39:+235249.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0aDXxdrln8&amp;sig=T7Ne1hE0kHZ44OiV-8tr229yQQw&amp;hl=ga&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6KQGVOaqB4ue7Aby8IDACQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%20thorium&amp;f=false |title=Isotopes of the Earth's Hydrosphere  By V.I. Ferronsky, V.A. Polyakov, pg 399}}&lt;/ref&gt; as uranium(VI) forms soluble [[carbonate]] complexes. The extraction of uranium from seawater has been considered as a means of obtaining the element.

==Sources of uranium==

===Mining and milling===
The radiation hazards of uranium mining and milling were not appreciated in the early years, resulting in workers exposed to high levels of radiation. Conventional uranium ore treatment mills create radioactive waste in the form of [[tailings]], which contain uranium, radium, and polonium. Consequently, uranium mining results in "the unavoidable radioactive contamination of the environment by solid, liquid and gaseous wastes".&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Inhalation of [[radon]] gas caused sharp increases in lung cancers among underground uranium miners employed in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name="ama-assn629"&gt;{{Cite journal

In the 1940s and 1950s, uranium mill tailings were released with impunity into water sources, and the radium leached from these tailings contaminated thousands of miles of the Colorado River system. Between 1966 and 1971, thousands of homes and commercial buildings in the Colorado Plateau region were "found to contain anomalously high concentrations of radon, after being built on uranium tailings taken from piles under the authority of the Atomic Energy Commission".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool (2011). ''Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', World Scientific, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:30mm DU slug.jpg|thumb|right|DU penetrator from the PGU-14/B incendiary 30&amp;nbsp;mm round]]

Depleted uranium (DU) is useful because of its very high [[density]] of 19.1&amp;nbsp;[[Gram|g]]/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (68.4% denser than lead). Civilian uses include counterweights in aircraft, radiation shielding in medical [[radiation therapy]] and industrial [[radiography]] equipment, and containers used to transport radioactive materials. Military uses include defensive armor plating and [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] [[projectiles]].

Uranium metal can disperse into the air and water, [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)]] study says in part:
: "The most important concern is the potential for future [[radioactive contamination|groundwater contamination]] by corroding penetrators (ammunition tips made out of DU). The munition tips recovered by the UNEP team had already decreased in mass by 10-15% in this way. This [[Corrosion|rapid corrosion]] speed underlines the importance of monitoring the water quality at the DU sites on an annual basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=241&amp;ArticleID=3036 |title=UNEP confirms low-level DU contamination |date=March 22, 2002 |publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combustion===
Studies of depleted uranium aerosol exposure suggest that uranium combustion product particles would quickly settle out of the air,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deploymentlink.osd.mil/du_library/du_ii/du_ii_tabl1.htm |title=Depleted uranium |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614010814/http://www.deploymentlink.osd.mil/du_library/du_ii/du_ii_tabl1.htm |archivedate=June 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus could not affect populations more than a few kilometres from target areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004032-200304000-00014 |author=C.

The U.S. has admitted that there have been over 100 "friendly fire" incidents in which members of the U.S. military have been struck by DU munitions, and that an unknown number have been exposed to DU via inhalation of combustion products from burning DU munitions.

===Corrosion===
It has been reported that the corrosion of uranium in a silica rich aqueous solution forms both [[uranium dioxide]] and [[uranium trioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |conference=Goldschmidt Conference |date=7–12 September 2003 |location=[[Kurashiki]], [[Japan]] |url=http://goldschmidt.info/2003/Abstracts.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] abstract |author=E. R. Trueman, S. Black, D. Read &amp; M. E. Hodson |title=Alteration of depleted uranium metal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pure water, [[schoepite]] {(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.12(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)} is formed &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/data/Schoepite.shtml |title=Schoepite Mineral Data |publisher= |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2010}} in the first week and then after four months [[studtite]] {(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·4(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)} was formed.

Uranium [[metal]] reacts with [[water]] to form [[hydrogen]] gas, this reaction forms [[uranium dioxide]] and 2% to 9% [[uranium hydride]]. It is important to note that the rate of corrosion due to water is far greater than that caused by oxygen at temperatures around {{convert|100|C|F}}. At pH values below 2 the corrosion rate at 100&amp;nbsp;°C goes down greatly, while as pH values go from 7 upwards the corrosion rate declines. Gamma irradiation has little effect on the corrosion rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. McD Baker, L. N. Less &amp; S. Orman |title=Uranium + water reaction. Part 1.—Kinetics, products and mechanism |journal=Transactions of the Faraday Society |volume=62 |pages=2513–2524 |year=1966 |doi=10.1039/TF9666202513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen gas inhibits the corrosion of uranium by water.

===Nuclear waste===
Spent [[uranium dioxide]] fuel is very insoluble in water, it is likely to release uranium (and [[fission products]]) even more slowly than borosilicate glass when in contact with water.&lt;ref&gt;B.E. Burakov, M.I Ojovan, W.E. Lee. Crystalline Materials for Actinide Immobilisation, Imperial College Press, London, 198 pp. (2010).
{{cite web |url=http://www.icpress.co.uk/engineering/p652.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309093650/http://www.icpress.co.uk/engineering/p652.html |archivedate=2012-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that while the vast majority of the uranium is removed by [[PUREX]] [[nuclear reprocessing]], a small amount of uranium is left in the [[raffinate]] from the first cycle of the PUREX process. In addition because of the decay of the transplutonium [[minor actinides]] and the residual [[plutonium]] in the waste the concentration of uranium will increase on the waste. This will occur on a time scale of hundreds and thousands of years.

==Health effects==
[[File:Trionuraniumanti.png|thumb|right|Tiron is a [[phenol]]oic [[aromatic]] [[sulfonic acid|disulfonic acid]]. It is an alternative to bicarbonate which has already been tested in animals.]]

Soluble uranium salts are [[toxic]], though less so than those of other heavy metals such as [[lead]] or [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. The organ which is most affected is the [[kidney]]. Soluble uranium salts are readily excreted in the [[urine]], although some accumulation in the kidneys does occur in the case of chronic exposure. The [[World Health Organization]] has established a daily "tolerated intake" of soluble uranium salts for the general public of 0.5&amp;nbsp;μg/kg body weight (or 35&amp;nbsp;μg for a 70&amp;nbsp;kg adult): exposure at this level is not thought to lead to any significant kidney damage.&lt;ref name="IAEA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Features/DU/faq_depleted_uranium.shtml |publisher=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] |title=Focus: Depleted Uranium |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318003818/http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Features/DU/faq_depleted_uranium.shtml |archivedate=March 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2010}}

The [[antidote]] for uranium in humans is [[bicarbonate]], which is used because uranium (VI) forms complexes with [[carbonate]]. An alternative is to use tiron (sodium 4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O. Braun, C. Contino, M.-H. Hengé-Napoli, E. Ansoborlo and B.

===Humans===
{{Further|Uranium#Human exposure}}

====Cancer====
In 1950, the US Public Health service began a comprehensive study of uranium miners, leading to the first publication of a statistical correlation between cancer and uranium mining, released in 1962.&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;Dawson, Susan E, and Gary E Madsen. "Uranium Mine Workers, Atomic Downwinders, and the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act." In Half Lives &amp; Half-Truths: Confronting the Radioactive Legacies of the Cold War, 117-143. Santa Fe: School For Advanced Research, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government eventually regulated the standard amount of [[radon]] in mines, setting the level at 0.3 [[Health effects of radon#Concentration units|WL]] on January 1, 1969.&lt;ref name=Brugge&gt;Brugge, Doug, Timothy Benally, and Esther Yazzie-Lewis. The Navajo People and Uranium Mining. Albuquerque : University of New Mexico Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of 69 69 present and former uranium milling sites in 12 states, 24 have been abandoned, and are the responsibility of the [[US Department of Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atomictraveler.com/MillDecommissioningData.pdf Decommissioning of U.S. Uranium Production Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt;  Accidental releases from uranium mills include the 1979 [[Church Rock uranium mill spill]] in New Mexico, called the largest accident of nuclear-related waste in US history, and the 1986 [[Sequoyah Corporation Fuels Release]] in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=Brugge2&gt;Doug Brugge, et al, "The Sequoyah  Corporation Fuels Release and the Church Rock Spill", ''American Journal of Public Health'', September 2007, Vol., 97, No. 9, pp. 1595-1600.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] (RECA), granting [[reparation (legal)|reparations]] for those affected by mining, with [[amendments]] passed in 2000 to address criticisms with the original act.&lt;ref name = Dawson/&gt;

[[File:Kosovo uranium NATO bombing1999.png|thumb|Sites in Kosovo and southern Central Serbia where NATO aviation used depleted uranium munitions during 1999 bombing]]
The use of depleted uranium (DU) in [[munitions]] is controversial because of questions about potential long-term health effects.&lt;ref name=MillerMcClain /&gt;&lt;ref name="John E 2009"/&gt; Normal functioning of the [[kidney]], [[brain]], [[liver]], [[heart]], and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because uranium is a [[toxic metal]].&lt;ref name=Craft04 /&gt; The aerosol produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites leading to possible inhalation by human beings.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;Mitsakou C, Eleftheriadis K, Housiadas C, Lazaridis M [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12705453 Modeling of the dispersion of depleted uranium aerosol.] 2003 Apr, Retrieved January 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; During a three-week period of conflict in 2003 in [[Iraq]], 1,000 to 2,000 tonnes of DU munitions were used.&lt;ref name="gaurdian2003"&gt;Paul Brown, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/apr/25/internationaleducationnews.armstrade Gulf troops face tests for cancer] ''guardian.co.uk'' 25 April 2003, Retrieved February 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual acute and chronic toxicity of DU is also a point of medical controversy.

====Birth defects====
Most scientific studies have found no link between uranium and birth defects, but some claim statistical correlations between soldiers exposed to DU, and those who were not, concerning reproductive abnormalities.

One study concluded that epidemiological evidence is consistent with an increased risk of birth defects in the offspring of persons exposed to DU.&lt;ref name="pmid16124873" /&gt; Environmental groups and others have expressed concern about the health effects of depleted uranium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/jul/10/iraq.armstrade |title=Our gift to Iraq |author=A.

In a study of UK troops, "Overall, the risk of any malformation among pregnancies reported by men was 50% higher in Gulf War Veterans (GWV) compared with Non-GWVs". The conclusion of the study stated ''"We found no evidence for a link between paternal deployment to the Gulf war and increased risk of stillbirth, chromosomal malformations, or congenital syndromes. Associations were found between fathers' service in the Gulf war and increased risk of miscarriage and less well-defined malformations, but these findings need to be interpreted with caution as such outcomes are susceptible to recall bias.

This will enable bacteria to reduce the uranium (VI) to uranium (IV) which is much less soluble. In [[peat]]-like soils the uranium will tend to bind to the [[humic acids]], this tends to fix the uranium in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/publications/2000annualreview/pdfs/NHMFL2000AR-Geochemistry.pdf |title=Geochemistry |format= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212095102/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/publications/2000annualreview/pdfs/NHMFL2000AR-Geochemistry.pdf |archivedate=December 12, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''User expectations''' refers to the consistency that users expect from products.  [[Interaction design]] is very concerned with this topic.  For example, our user expectations for traffic behavior is one of the more consistent ones because it is governed by [[traffic law]]s that are enforced.  [[Software]], or even worse small [[consumer electronics]], on the other hand, can have widely varying degrees of consistency.

A good [[rule of thumb]] or ''design principle'' to use in interaction design is to follow the "[[Principle of least astonishment]]".  In the case of interactive [[software application]]s, for example,  users form expectations based on their experience with similar kinds of software. Effective [[software design]] aims to conform with prevailing norms for aspects of behavior such as the software's [[user interface]] and its [[responsiveness]].

A commonly noted sign of poor [[usability]] and [[human factors]] due to the violation of user expectations is when [[information sign|signs]] are needed for common things like doors.  This was made famous by [[Donald A. Norman]] in his seminal book [[The Psychology of Everyday Things]].  There is also a website devoted to such Bad Designs [http://baddesigns.com].

==Ward-Beck Systems Preservation Society (WBSPS)==
The [http://wbsps.kuzub.com Ward-Beck Systems Preservation Society] was founded in 2005 by [[Tony Kuzub]]. The goal and objective of the WBSPS is to keep vintage Ward-Beck equipment running and working by supplying a database of documentation, knowledge, and support.  There are only a handful of consoles still in existence and use, and the WBSPS is dedicated to keeping these consoles in use and maintained.  Many manuals have been scanned in their entirety and posted for all to learn from. The WBSPS was given permission by [[Eugene Johnson]] of [[Ward-Beck]] to publish information regarding vintage WBS equipment.&lt;ref&gt;http://wbsps.Kuzub.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The WBSPS is not directly or in-directly associated with Ward-Beck Systems Incorporated.

The '''Wells Print Shop''' was located at 27 Cuna Street in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. It operated as part of the [[Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board]]'s 18th century museum village, San Agustín Antiguo, demonstrating the colonial printmaking process.&lt;mapframe latitude="29.8949" longitude="-81.3152" zoom="15" width="250" height="200" align="right"&gt;

== William Wells ==
[[William Charles Wells]] was born in 1757 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the son of a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] printer, publisher, and bookseller. He was formally trained as a doctor, receiving a degree in medicine from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1780. When the British left Charleston in 1782, William and his brother John moved to St. Augustine where they established a print shop. In St. Augustine the Wells brothers are most well known for publishing the ''East Florida Gazette'', the first newspaper in Florida. After the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]] returned Florida to the Spanish, William Wells went to England and practiced medicine for the rest of his life. He died in London in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 1986|title=Two Noteworthy Acquisitions for the WHL in 1985-86|url=|journal=Waring Library Society Newsletter|volume=9|pages=3-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''East Florida Gazette'' ==
The Wells brothers' publication began on February 1, 1783 and lasted a little over one year, with the last issue published on March 22, 1784. London's Public Record Office only contains three issues of the newspaper, those from March 1, May 3, and May 17, 1783. The St. Augustine Historical Society resurrected the name "East Florida Gazette" with its newsletter, which is indexed on the Historical Society Research Library's online catalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saintaugustinehistoricalsociety.org/research-library/|title=St. Augustine Historical Society - Research Library|website=www.saintaugustinehistoricalsociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Wells Print Shop.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Wells Print Shop, 1971]]
The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board reconstructed the Wells Print Shop in 1968 on Cuna Street. The original Wells printing press owned by William and John was located on Treasury Lane. The all-wooden shop was constructed using board-and-[[batten]] building method, which the British settlers in St. Augustine preferred for its quick construction and ease of repair. The building is 220 square feet. 

Inside the print shop was a replica of the type of printing press used towards the end of the 18th century. The press was operated daily to demonstrate the printing process to visitors, but the Preservation Board also used it to make reproductions of historic St. Augustine maps and replicas of the ''East Florida Gazette,'' which were sold as souvenirs. 

Today the site once occupied by the Wells Print Shop operates as a jewelry store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myersjewelryandgifts.com/|title=Myers Jewelry and Gifts|website=www.myersjewelryandgifts.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
