'''2010 KQ''' is a small [[asteroid]]-like object that has been discovered in an orbit about the Sun that is so similar to the Earth's orbit that scientists strongly suspect it to be a [[rocket stage]] that escaped years ago from the Earth–Moon system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asteroid 2010 KQ: Probably a Rocket Body|url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news168.html|author=Don Yeomans|author2=Paul Chodas|author3=Steve Chesley|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=NASA/JPL Near-Earth Object Program Office|date=May 27, 2010|accessdate=2010-05-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100530081141/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news168.html| archivedate= 30 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object was discovered on May 16, 2010 by Richard Kowalski at the [[Catalina Sky Survey]], and has subsequently been observed by many observers, including Bill Ryan ([[Magdalena Ridge Observatory]]) and Peter Birtwhistle (England). It was given the asteroid designation 2010 KQ by the [[Minor Planet Center]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], who identified its orbit as being very similar to that of the Earth. Orbit refinements by [[JPL]]'s Paul Chodas and amateur astronomer Bill Gray have shown that this object was very close to the Earth in early 1975, but the trajectory is not known with enough accuracy to associate the object with any particular launch. Nevertheless, scientists do not expect that a natural object could remain in this type of orbit for very long because of its relatively high impact probability with the Earth. In fact, an analysis carried out by Paul Chodas suggests that 2010 KQ has a 6% chance of impacting the Earth over a 30-year period starting in 2036.

Near-infrared spectral measurements of this object carried out by S.J. Bus (University of Hawaii) using the [[NASA IRTF telescope]] on [[Mauna Kea]], Hawaii, indicate that its spectral characteristics do not match those of any of the known asteroid types, and in fact are similar to those of a rocket body. The object's [[absolute magnitude]] (28.9) also suggests that it is only a few meters in size, about the size of an [[upper stage]]. Additional observations over the coming months should allow scientists to discern how strongly solar radiation pressure affects the object's motion, a result that could help distinguish a solid, rocky asteroid from a lighter man-made object.

Astronomer Richard Miles believes 2010 KQ may be the 4th stage of the [[Proton (rocket)|Russian Proton rocket]] from the [[Luna 23]] mission, launched October 28, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcogt.net/en/blog/egomez/man-made-object-spotted-ftn Man-made object spotted with FTN] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120630184904/http://lcogt.net/en/blog/egomez/man-made-object-spotted-ftn |date=2012-06-30 }}, Edward Gomez, May 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the unlikely event that this object is headed for impact with the Earth, whether it is an asteroid or rocket body, it is so small that it would disintegrate in the atmosphere and not cause harm on the ground.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9038">'''5D BIM''', an acronym for 5D [[Building Information Modeling]], is a term used in the [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] and [[construction]] industries, and refers to the intelligent linking of individual [[3D CAD]] components or assemblies with schedule (time - [[4D BIM]]) constraints
&lt;ref name=5DBIM-R-04&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/4D/ |title=Introduction to 4D Research by Martin Fischer |publisher=stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then with cost-related information.&lt;ref name=5DBIM-R-02/&gt;

'''5D =  3D + SCHEDULE + COST'''&lt;ref&gt;THIS IS A BASIC DEFINITION&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of 5D models enables the various participants (from architects, designers, contractors to owners) of a construction project to visualize the progress of construction activities and its related costs over time.&lt;ref name=5DBIM-R-03/&gt;&lt;ref name=5DBIM-R-05/&gt; This BIM-centric project management technique has potential to improve management and delivery of projects of any size or complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Fred. "[http://www.theb1m.com/video/what-is-5d-bim What is 5D BIM?]". www.TheB1M.com. The B1M Limited. Retrieved 8 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, McKinsey, a consultancy, identified 5D BIM technology as one of five big ideas poised to disrupt construction.It defined 5D BIM as "a five-dimensional representation of the physical and functional characteristics of any project. It considers a project’s cost and schedule in addition to the standard spatial design parameters in 3-D." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/imagining-constructions-digital-future|title=Imagining construction’s digital future|website=McKinsey &amp; Company|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Usage ==

In Germany and Europe at large, 5D BIM technology is prevalent among large general contractors.

'''Ada''' is a [[structured programming|structured]], [[statically typed]], [[Imperative programming|imperative]], and [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[High-level programming language|high-level]] [[computer programming|computer]] [[programming language]], extended from [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and other languages. It has built-in language support for [[design by contract|design-by-contract]], extremely strong typing, explicit concurrency, tasks, synchronous message passing, protected objects, and [[nondeterministic programming|non-determinism]]. Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of runtime errors. Ada is an international standard; the current version (known as Ada 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganssle |first=Jack |url=http://www.adaic.org/ |title=Ada Resource Association – News and resource for the Ada programming language |publisher=Adaic.org |date=2013-05-29 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is defined by ISO/IEC 8652:2012.&lt;ref name=ISO_IEC_8652_2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=61507|title=ISO/IEC 8652:2012 ''Information technology -- Programming languages -- Ada''|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ada was originally designed by a team led by [[Jean Ichbiah]] of [[Groupe Bull|CII Honeywell Bull]] under contract to the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) from 1977 to 1983 to supersede over 450 programming languages used by the DoD at that time.&lt;ref name="Um"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ada Programming Language|url=http://groups.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/ada/ada.html|website=University of Mich|accessdate=27 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522063844/http://groups.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/ada/ada.html|archive-date=2016-05-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ada was named after [[Ada Lovelace]] (1815–1852), who has been credited as the first computer programmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887|title=Lovelace &amp; babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes'|journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume=25|issue=4|pages=16–26|year=2003|last1=Fuegi|first1=J|last2=Francis|first2=J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Ada was originally targeted at [[embedded system|embedded]] and [[real-time computing|real-time]] systems. The Ada&amp;nbsp;95 revision, designed by [[Tucker Taft|S. Tucker Taft]] of [[Intermetrics]] between 1992 and 1995, improved support for systems, numerical, financial, and [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP).

Features of Ada include: [[strongly typed languages|strong typing]], [[modularity (programming)|modularity mechanisms]] (packages), [[run-time checking]], [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]] ([[Task (computing)|tasks]], synchronous [[message passing]], [[protected objects]], and nondeterministic [[Switch statement|select statements]]), [[exception handling]], and [[generic programming|generics]]. Ada&amp;nbsp;95 added support for [[object-oriented programming]], including [[dynamic dispatch]].

The syntax of Ada minimizes choices of ways to perform basic operations, and prefers English keywords (such as "or else" and "and then") to symbols (such as "||" and "&amp;&amp;"). Ada uses the basic arithmetical operators "+", "-", "*", and "/", but avoids using other symbols. Code blocks are delimited by words such as "declare", "begin", and "end", where the "end" (in most cases) is followed by the identifier of the block it closes (e.g., ''if … end if'', ''loop … end loop''). In the case of conditional blocks this avoids a ''[[dangling else]]'' that could pair with the wrong nested if-expression in other languages like C or Java.

Ada is designed for development of very large software systems. Ada packages can be compiled separately.  Ada package specifications (the package interface) can also be compiled separately without the implementation to check for consistency.  This makes it possible to detect problems early during the design phase, before implementation starts.

A large number of compile-time checks are supported to help avoid bugs that would not be detectable until run-time in some other languages or would require explicit checks to be added to the source code.  For example, the syntax requires explicitly named closing of blocks to prevent errors due to mismatched end tokens. The adherence to strong typing allows detection of many common software errors (wrong parameters, range violations, invalid references, mismatched types, etc.) either during compile-time, or otherwise during run-time. As concurrency is part of the language specification, the compiler can in some cases detect potential deadlocks.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Compilers also commonly check for misspelled identifiers, visibility of packages, redundant declarations, etc. and can provide warnings and useful suggestions on how to fix the error.

Ada also supports run-time checks to protect against access to unallocated memory, [[buffer overflow]] errors, range violations, [[off-by-one error]]s, array access errors, and other detectable bugs. These checks can be disabled in the interest of runtime efficiency, but can often be compiled efficiently. It also includes facilities to help program verification. For these reasons, Ada is widely used in critical systems, where any [[anomaly in software|anomaly]] might lead to very serious consequences, e.g., accidental death, injury or severe financial loss. Examples of systems where Ada is used include [[avionics]], [[Air traffic control|ATC]], railways, banking, military and space technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ada helps churn out less-buggy code|url=http://gcn.com/Articles/1999/06/30/Ada-helps-churn-out-lessbuggy-code.aspx|publisher=Government Computer News|accessdate=2010-09-14|author=S. Tucker Taft|author2=Florence Olsen|pages=2–3|date=1999-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ada_usage&gt;{{cite web|last=Feldman|first=Michael|title=Who's using Ada?|url=http://www.seas.gwu.edu/~mfeldman/ada-project-summary.html#Banking_and_Financial_Systems_|publisher=SIGAda Education Working Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Access type}}Ada's dynamic [[memory management]] is high-level and type-safe.  Ada does not have generic or untyped [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]; nor does it implicitly declare any pointer type.  Instead, all dynamic memory allocation and deallocation must take place through explicitly declared ''access types''.
Each access type has an associated ''storage pool'' that handles the low-level details of memory management; the programmer can either use the default storage pool or define new ones (this is particularly relevant for [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]]).  It is even possible to declare several different access types that all designate the same type but use different storage pools.
Also, the language provides for ''accessibility checks'', both at compile time and at run time, that ensures that an ''access value'' cannot outlive the type of the object it points to.

Though the semantics of the language allow automatic [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] of inaccessible objects, most implementations do not support it by default, as it would cause unpredictable behaviour in real-time systems.  Ada does support a limited form of [[region-based memory management]]; also, creative use of storage pools can provide for a limited form of automatic garbage collection, since destroying a storage pool also destroys all the objects in the pool.

A double-[[dash]] ("--"), resembling an [[em dash]], denotes comment text.  Comments stop at end of line, to prevent unclosed comments from accidentally voiding whole sections of source code.  Disabling a whole block of code now requires the prefixing of each line (or column) individually with "--". While clearly denoting disabled code with a column of repeated "--" down the page this renders the experimental dis/re-enablement of large blocks a more drawn out process.

The semicolon (";") is a [[statement terminator]], and the null or no-operation statement is &lt;code&gt;null;&lt;/code&gt;. A single &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; without a statement to terminate is not allowed.

Unlike most [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards, the Ada language definition (known as the ''Ada Reference Manual'' or ''ARM'', or sometimes the ''Language Reference Manual'' or ''LRM'') is [[free content]]. Thus, it is a common reference for Ada programmers and not just programmers implementing Ada compilers. Apart from the reference manual, there is also an extensive rationale document which explains the language design and the use of various language constructs. This document is also widely used by programmers. When the language was revised, a new rationale document was written.

One notable [[free software]] tool that is used by many Ada programmers to aid them in writing Ada source code is the [[GNAT Programming Studio]].

== History ==
In the 1970s, the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] (DoD) was concerned by the number of different programming languages being used for its embedded computer system projects, many of which were obsolete or hardware-dependent, and none of which supported safe modular programming. In 1975, a [[working group]], the [[High Order Language Working Group]] (HOLWG), was formed with the intent to reduce this number by finding or creating a programming language generally suitable for the department's and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Defence]] requirements. After many iterations beginning with an original [[Straw man proposal]] the eventual programming language was named Ada. The total number of high-level programming languages in use for such projects fell from over 450 in 1983 to 37 by 1996.

The HOLWG working group crafted the [[Steelman language requirements]], a series of documents stating the requirements they felt a programming language should satisfy. Many existing languages were formally reviewed, but the team concluded in 1977 that no existing language met the specifications.

Requests for proposals for a new programming language were issued and four contractors were hired to develop their proposals under the names of Red ([[Intermetrics]] led by Benjamin Brosgol), Green ([[CII Honeywell Bull]], led by [[Jean Ichbiah]]), Blue ([[SofTech, Inc.|SofTech]], led by John Goodenough)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/people/jbg.cfm |title=John Goodenough &amp;#124; SEI Staff Profile |publisher=Sei.cmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Yellow ([[SRI International]], led by Jay Spitzen).&lt;!-- Though Intermetrics and Bull have previous links, I am including them for parallelism. --&gt; In April 1978, after public scrutiny, the Red and Green proposals passed to the next phase. In May 1979, the Green proposal, designed by Jean Ichbiah at CII Honeywell Bull, was chosen and given the name Ada—after [[Ada Lovelace|Augusta Ada, Countess of Lovelace]]. This proposal was influenced by the programming language [[LIS programming language|LIS]] that Ichbiah and his group had developed in the 1970s. The preliminary Ada reference manual
was published in ACM SIGPLAN Notices in June 1979. The Military Standard reference manual was approved on December 10, 1980 ([[Ada Lovelace]]'s birthday), and
given the number MIL-STD-1815 in honor of Ada Lovelace's birth year. In 1981, [[C. A. R. Hoare]] took advantage of his [[Turing Award]] speech to criticize Ada for being overly complex and hence unreliable,&lt;ref&gt;C.A.R. Hoare, "[http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs422/2011/bib/hoare81emperor.pdf The Emperor's Old Clothes]." Communications of the ACM, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently seemed to recant in the foreword he wrote for an Ada textbook.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Watt, B.A. Wichmann and W. Findlay, "Ada: Language and Methodology." Prentice-Hall, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ada attracted much attention from the programming community as a whole during its early days.  Its backers and others predicted that it might become a dominant language for general purpose programming and not just defense-related work.&lt;ref name="sward" /&gt;  Ichbiah publicly stated that within ten years, only two programming languages would remain, Ada and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]].&lt;ref name=SIGAda-Rosen&gt;J-P. Rosen, "The Ada Paradox(es)", ''Ada Letters'', ACM SIGAda, Vol. 24, No. 2, August 2009, pp. 28-35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Ada compilers struggled to implement the large, complex language, and both compile-time and run-time performance tended to be slow and tools primitive.&lt;ref name="sward" /&gt;   Compiler vendors expended most of their efforts in passing the massive, language-conformance-testing, government-required "ACVC" validation suite that was required in another novel feature of the Ada language effort.&lt;ref name=SIGAda-Rosen /&gt;

The first validated Ada implementation was the NYU Ada/Ed translator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA136759 |title=Ada Compiler Validation Summary Report: NYU Ada/ED, Version 19.7 V-001 |authors=SofTech Inc., Waltham, MA |date=1983-04-11 |accessdate=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; certified on April 11, 1983.

[[File:Ada Lovelace 1838.jpg|right|caption|thumbnail|157px|[[Ada Lovelace|Augusta Ada King]], Countess of Lovelace.]]
In 1991, the US Department of Defense began to require the use of Ada (the ''Ada mandate'') for all software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adaic.com/pol-hist/policy/mandate.txt |title=The Congressional Ada Mandate |author=Ada Information Clearinghouse |date=1983-04-11 |accessdate=2015-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073005/http://archive.adaic.com/pol-hist/policy/mandate.txt |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though exceptions to this rule were often granted.&lt;ref name="sward" /&gt;  The Department of Defense Ada mandate was effectively removed in 1997, as the DoD began to embrace  [[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] technology.&lt;ref name="sward"&gt;{{cite conference |contribution=The rise, fall and persistence of Ada |first=Ricky E. |last=Sward |date=November 2010 |title=SIGAda '10: Proceedings of the ACM SIGAda annual international conference on SIGAda |pages=71–74 |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1879063.1879081&amp;coll=DL&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;CFID=551420221&amp;CFTOKEN=60383966 | doi=10.1145/1879063.1879081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar requirements existed in other [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]] countries: Ada was required for NATO systems involving command and control and other functions, and Ada was the mandated or preferred language for defense-related applications in countries such as Sweden, Germany, and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a217657.pdf | first= Nicholas J. | last=Babiak | title=Ada, the New DoD Weapon System Computer Language – Panacea or Calamity | publisher=[[Air University (United States Air Force)]] | date=1989 | pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1980s and early 1990s, Ada compilers had improved in performance, but there were still barriers to full exploitation of Ada's abilities, including a tasking model that was different from what most real-time programmers were used to.&lt;ref name=SIGAda-Rosen /&gt;

Because of Ada's [[Safety-critical system|safety-critical]] support features, it is now used not only for military applications, but also in commercial projects where a software bug can have severe consequences, e.g., [[avionics]] and [[air traffic control]], commercial rockets such as the [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane 4 and 5]], [[satellite]]s and other space systems, railway transport and banking.&lt;ref name=Ada_usage /&gt;
For example, the [[Airplane Information Management System]], the [[Aircraft flight control systems|fly-by-wire]] system software in the [[Boeing 777]], was written in Ada.&lt;ref name="hads" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wolfe" /&gt;  Developed by [[Honeywell Aerospace|Honeywell Air Transport Systems]] in collaboration with consultants from [[DDC-I]], it became arguably the best-known of any Ada project, civilian or military.&lt;ref name="hads"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=The HADS Team | first=Karl | last=Rehmer | year= 2009 | title=Beautiful Teams: Inspiring and Cautionary Tales from Veteran Team Leaders | editor-first=Andrew | editor-last=Stellman | editor2-first= Jennifer | editor2-last=Greene | publisher=O'Reilly | location=Sebastopol, California | pages=299–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wolfe"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1035608 |title=There's Still Some Life Left in Ada |first=Alexander |last=Wolfe |journal=[[ACM Queue]] |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=28 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1145/1035594.1035608}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Automated Air Traffic System was written in 1 million lines of Ada ([[Source lines of code|SLOC]] count). It featured advanced distributed processing, a distributed Ada database, and object-oriented design. Ada is also used in other air traffic systems, e.g., the UK’s next-generation Interim Future Area Control Tools Support (iFACTS) air traffic control system is designed and implemented using [[SPARK (programming language)|SPARK]] Ada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AdaCore|title=GNAT Pro Chosen for UK’s Next Generation ATC System|url=http://www.adacore.com/2007/06/19/adacore-gnat-pro-chosen-for-uk-next-generation/|access-date=2011-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224163518/http://www.adacore.com/2007/06/19/adacore-gnat-pro-chosen-for-uk-next-generation/|archive-date=2010-12-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also used in the [[France|French]] [[Transmission Voie-Machine|TVM]] in-[[cab signalling]] system on the [[TGV]] high-speed rail system, and the metro suburban trains in Paris, London, Hong Kong and New York City.&lt;ref name=Ada_usage /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AdaCore|title=Look Who’s Using Ada|url=http://www.adacore.com/home/ada_answers/lookwho/|access-date=2011-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224102110/http://www.adacore.com/home/ada_answers/lookwho|archive-date=2010-12-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standardization ==
The language became an [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard in 1983 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20040625113309/http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/Welcome.html ANSI/MIL-STD 1815A]), and after translation in French and without any further changes in English became
an [[International standard|ISO standard]] in 1987 (ISO-8652:1987). This version of the language is commonly known as Ada&amp;nbsp;83, from the date of its adoption by ANSI, but is sometimes referred to also as Ada&amp;nbsp;87, from the date of its adoption by ISO.

Ada&amp;nbsp;95, the joint ISO/ANSI standard ([http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-TTL.html ISO-8652:1995]) was published in February 1995, making Ada&amp;nbsp;95 the first ISO standard object-oriented programming language. To help with the standard revision and future acceptance, the [[US Air Force]] funded the development of the [[GNAT]] [[Compiler]]. Presently, the GNAT Compiler is part of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]].

Work has continued on improving and updating the technical content of the Ada programming language. A Technical Corrigendum to Ada&amp;nbsp;95 was published in October 2001, and a major Amendment, [http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=45001 ISO/IEC 8652:1995/Amd 1:2007] was published on March 9, 2007. At the Ada-Europe 2012 conference in Stockholm, the Ada Resource Association (ARA) and Ada-Europe announced the completion of the design of the latest version of the Ada programming language and the submission of the reference manual to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for approval. ISO/IEC 8652:2012 was published in December 2012.&lt;ref name=ISO_IEC_8652_2012 /&gt;

Other related standards include [[ISO 8651]]-3:1988 ''Information processing systems—Computer graphics—Graphical Kernel System (GKS) language bindings—Part 3: Ada''.

== Language constructs ==
Ada is an [[ALGOL]]-like programming language featuring control structures with reserved words such as ''if'', ''then'', ''else'', ''while'', ''for'', and so on. However, Ada also has many data structuring facilities and other abstractions which were not included in the original [[ALGOL 60]], such as [[type system|type definitions]], [[record (computer science)|records]], [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]], [[enumerated type|enumerations]]. Such constructs were in part inherited from or inspired by [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].

=== "Hello, world!" in Ada ===
A common example of a language's [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] is the [[Hello world program]]:
(hello.adb)
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ada"&gt;
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
procedure Hello is
begin
  Put_Line ("Hello, world!");
end Hello;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
This program can be compiled by using the freely available open source compiler [[GNAT]], by executing
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bash"&gt;gnatmake hello.adb&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Data types ===
Ada's type system is not based on a set of predefined [[primitive types]] but allows users to declare their own types. This declaration in turn is not based on the internal representation of the type but on describing the goal which should be achieved. This allows the compiler to determine a suitable memory size for the type, and to check for violations of the type definition at compile time and run time (i.e., range violations, buffer overruns, type consistency, etc.). Ada supports numerical types defined by a range, modulo types, aggregate types (records and arrays), and enumeration types. Access types define a reference to an instance of a specified type; untyped pointers are not permitted.
Special types provided by the language are task types and protected types.

For example, a date might be represented as:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ada"&gt;
type Day_type   is range    1 ..   31;
type Month_type is range    1 ..   12;
type Year_type  is range 1800 .. 2100;
type Hours is mod 24;
type Weekday is (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday);

type Date is
   record
     Day   : Day_type;
     Month : Month_type;
     Year  : Year_type;
   end record;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Types can be refined by declaring subtypes:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ada"&gt;
subtype Working_Hours is Hours range 0 .. 12;            -- at most 12 Hours to work a day
subtype Working_Day is Weekday range Monday .. Friday;   -- Days to work

Work_Load: constant array(Working_Day) of Working_Hours  -- implicit type declaration
   := (Friday =&gt; 6, Monday =&gt; 4, others =&gt; 10);           -- lookup table for working hours with initialization

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Types can have modifiers such as ''limited, abstract, private'' etc. Private types can only be accessed and limited types can only be modified or copied within the scope of the package that defines them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ada Syntax Card |url=http://www.digilife.be/quickreferences/QRC/Ada%20Syntax%20Card.pdf |accessdate=28 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133825/http://www.digilife.be/quickreferences/QRC/Ada%20Syntax%20Card.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ada 95 adds additional features for object-oriented extension of types.

=== Control structures ===
Ada is a [[structured programming]] language, meaning that the flow of control is structured into standard statements. All standard constructs and deep level early exit are supported so the use of the also supported '[[goto (command)|go to]]' commands is seldom needed.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ada"&gt;
-- while a is not equal to b, loop.
while a /= b loop
  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Waiting");
end loop;

if a &gt; b then
  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Condition met");
else
  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ("Condition not met");
end if;

for i in 1 .. 10 loop
  Ada.Text_IO.Put ("Iteration: ");
  Ada.Text_IO.Put (i);
  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line;
end loop;

loop
  a := a + 1;
  exit when a = 10;
end loop;

case i is
  when 0 =&gt; Ada.Text_IO.Put ("zero");
  when 1 =&gt; Ada.Text_IO.Put ("one");
  when 2 =&gt; Ada.Text_IO.Put ("two");
  -- case statements have to cover all possible cases:
  when others =&gt; Ada.Text_IO.Put ("none of the above");
end case;

for aWeekday in Weekday'Range loop               -- loop over an enumeration
   Put_Line ( Weekday'Image(aWeekday) );         -- output string representation of an enumeration
   if aWeekday in Working_Day then               -- check of a subtype of an enumeration
      Put_Line ( " to work for " &amp;
               Working_Hours'Image (Work_Load(aWeekday)) ); -- access into a lookup table
   end if;
end loop;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Packages, procedures and functions ===
Among the parts of an Ada program are packages, procedures and functions.

Example:
Package specification (example.ads)
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ada"&gt;
package Example is
     type Number is range 1 .. 11;
     procedure Print_and_Increment (j: in out Number);
end Example;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Package body (example.adb)
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="ada"&gt;
with Ada.Text_IO;
package body Example is

This program can be compiled, e.g., by using the freely available open source compiler [[GNAT]], by executing
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bash"&gt;gnatmake -z example.adb&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Packages, procedures and functions can nest to any depth and each can also be the logical outermost block.

Each package, procedure or function can have its own declarations of constants, types, variables, and other procedures, functions and packages, which can be declared in any order.

=== Concurrency ===
Ada has language support for task-based concurrency. The fundamental concurrent unit in Ada is a ''task'', which is a built-in limited type. Tasks are specified in two parts – the task declaration defines the task interface (similar to a type declaration), the task body specifies the implementation of the task.
Depending on the implementation, Ada tasks are either mapped to operating system threads or processes, or are scheduled internally by the Ada runtime.

Tasks can have entries for synchronisation (a form of [[message passing|synchronous message passing]]). Task entries are declared in the task specification. Each task entry can have one or more ''accept'' statements within the task body. If the control flow of the task reaches an accept statement, the task is blocked until the corresponding entry is called by another task (similarly, a calling task is blocked until the called task reaches the corresponding accept statement). Task entries can have parameters similar to procedures, allowing tasks to synchronously exchange data. In conjunction with ''select'' statements it is possible to define ''guards'' on accept statements (similar to Dijkstra's [[guarded commands]]).

Ada also offers ''[[protected object]]s'' for [[mutual exclusion]]. Protected objects are a [[Monitor (synchronization)|monitor-like]] construct, but use guards instead of conditional variables for signaling (similar to conditional critical regions). Protected objects combine the data encapsulation and safe mutual exclusion from monitors, and entry guards from conditional critical regions.  The main advantage over classical monitors is that conditional variables are not required for signaling, avoiding potential deadlocks due to incorrect locking semantics. Like tasks, the protected object is a built-in limited type, and it also has a declaration part and a body.

A protected object consists of encapsulated private data (which can only be accessed from within the protected object), and procedures, functions and entries which are guaranteed to be mutually exclusive (with the only exception of functions, which are required to be side effect free and can therefore run concurrently with other functions). A task calling a protected object is blocked if another task is currently executing inside the same protected object, and released when this other task leaves the protected object. Blocked tasks are queued on the protected object ordered by time of arrival.

Protected object entries are similar to procedures, but additionally have ''guards''. If a guard evaluates to false, a calling task is blocked and added to the queue of that entry; now another task can be admitted to the protected object, as no task is currently executing inside the protected object. Guards are re-evaluated whenever a task leaves the protected object, as this is the only time when the evaluation of guards can have changed.

Calls to entries can be ''requeued'' to other entries with the same signature. A task that is requeued is blocked and added to the queue of the target entry; this means that the protected object is released and allows admission of another task.

The ''select'' statement in Ada can be used to implement non-blocking entry calls and accepts, non-deterministic selection of entries (also with guards), time-outs and aborts.

The following example illustrates some concepts of concurrent programming in Ada.

=== Pragmas ===
A pragma is a [[compiler directive]] that conveys information to the compiler to allow specific manipulation of compiled output.&lt;ref name="Ada '83 Language Reference Manual"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-02-08.html#2.8 |title=Ada 83 LRM, Sec 2.8: Pragmas |publisher=Archive.adaic.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain pragmas are built into the language&lt;ref name="Ada '83 Language Reference Manual AppendixB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-B.html |title=Ada 83 LRM, Appendix/Annex B: Predefined Language Pragmas |publisher=Archive.adaic.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206005541/http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/lrm-B.html |archivedate=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others are implementation-specific.

Examples of common usage of compiler pragmas would be to disable certain features, such as run-time type checking or array subscript boundary checking, or to instruct the compiler to insert object code in lieu of a function call (as C/C++ does with inline functions).

'''''Alag''''' ({{lang-en|Different}}) is a 2006 [[Bollywood]] film starring [[Akshay Kapoor]] and [[Dia Mirza]] and directed by [[Ashu Trikha]] and produced by Subi Samuel.

==Plot==
Widower Hemant Rastogi lives in scenic [[Mahabaleshwar]], seemingly alone. One night he has a heart attack and passes away. When the police search his residence they find Tejas, Hemant's only son, in the basement of the house. Tejas has spent his entire life in the basement and as a result of this is extremely sensitive to sunlight. The Police ask Purva Rana, head of P.R. Institute (an institute for the rehabilitation of young criminals) to look after Tejas, whose only experience of other people up until this point has been with his father and the books he provided for him. Tejas starts showing signs of [[Telekenesis]], and is shunned by the other boys in the institute, resulting in the near-fatal accident of a security guard and the death of a fellow student. Tejas redeems himself in the eyes of Purva's wealthy father, Pushkar, when he is able to wake his wife, Gayatri Rana, from a coma-like condition. It looks like Tejas has been accepted into the Rana household, but he is subsequently harassed by doctors and scientists wishing to perform experiments on him. When Tejas and Pushkar both refuse to be part of these experiments, Tejas is abducted and held in a glass chamber by Dr. Richard Dyer, who wants to control his mind for his own benefit. Purva realises that Tejas has been abducted, and is fatally injured by Dr. Dyer in a rescue attempt. At the sight of this, Tejas' anger causes his powers to surge, shattering the glass cage, killing Dr. Dyer and electrocuting Purva. Tejas brings her back to life by shocking her with his hands. Purva and Tejas driving away into the sunset.

'''Ammonium dinitramide''' ('''ADN''') is the [[ammonium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[dinitraminic acid]]. ADN decomposes under heat to leave only nitrogen, oxygen, and water. The ions are the ammonium ion NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the dinitramide N(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.

It makes an excellent [[solid rocket]] oxidizer with a slightly higher specific impulse than [[ammonium perchlorate]] and more importantly, does not leave [[hydrogen chloride]] fumes. This property is also of military interest because halogen free smoke is harder to detect. It decomposes into low molecular mass gases so it contributes to higher performance without creating excessive temperatures if used in gun or rocket propellants. The salt is prone to detonation under high temperatures and shock more so than the [[perchlorate]].

The EURENCO Bofors company produced LMP-103S as a 1-to-1 substitute for [[hydrazine]] by dissolving 65% ammonium dinitramide, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in 35% water solution of methanol and ammonia.  LMP-103S has 6% higher specific impulse and 30% higher impulse density than hydrazine monopropellant. Additionally, hydrazine is highly toxic and carcinogenic, while LMP-103S is only moderately toxic. LMP-103S is UN Class 1.4S allowing for transport on commercial aircraft, and was demonstrated on the Prisma satellite in 2010. Special handling is not required.  LMP-103S could replace hydrazine as the most commonly used [[monopropellant]].&lt;ref&gt;Swedish Space Corporation Group, ''Monopropellant LMP-103S'', 2011, www.ecap.se{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Ammonium dinitramid was invented in 1971 in Zelinskiy Institute of Organic Chemistry in the USSR. Initially all information related to this compound was classified because of its use as a rocket propellant, particularly in [[Topol-M]] intercontinental ballistic missiles. In 1989 ammonium dinitramid was independently discovered at [[SRI International]].&lt;ref name="sri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/psd/research/adn.html |title=Dinitramide Salts: ADN Plus Other Salts |publisher=[[SRI International]] |accessdate=2012-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526005446/http://www.sri.com/psd/research/adn.html |archivedate=2012-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SRI obtained US and international patents for ADN in the mid-1990s, at which time scientists from the former Soviet Union revealed they had discovered ADN 18 years earlier.&lt;ref name="sri"/&gt;

== Preparation  ==
In laboratory ammonium dinitramid can be prepared by nitration of [[sulfaminic acid]] or its salt under low temperatures.  The process is performed under red light, since the compound is decomposed by higher energy photons. The details of the synthesis remain classified.
Other sources{{who|date=August 2018}} report ammonium synthesis from [[ammonium nitrate]], anhydrous [[nitric acid]], and fuming [[sulfuric acid]] containing 20% free [[sulfur trioxide]]. A base other than ammonia must be added before the acid dinitramide decomposes. The final product is obtained by fractional crystallization.

'''BancNet''' (also spelled '''Bancnet''') is a Philippine-based [[interbank network]] connecting the [[Automatic teller machine|ATM]] networks of local and offshore banks, and the largest interbank network in the Philippines in terms of the number of member banks and annual transactions.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

BancNet is also the exclusive gateway of China's [[UnionPay]], allowing access to the nearly 1 billion ATM cardholders from [[China]]. BancNet is allied with global payment brand [[JCB Co., Ltd.|JCB International]]. Through this alliance, JCB cardholders can now do cash advances at participating BancNet member ATMs nationwide.
Bancnet interconnects with international card networks Diners Club, Discover Card, KFTC, MasterCard, and VISA
 
BancNet serves more than 41 million ATM cardholders of its 114 members and affiliates with over 12,000 ATMs and more than 5,000 POS terminals.

In 2008, [[Expressnet]] outsourced its ATM operations to BancNet. On January 30, 2015, BancNet and [[MegaLink]] announced their merger and will retain itself as its brand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/banking/2015/02/03/1419457/bancnet-megalink-merger-marks-new-beginning-e-payments&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
BancNet was founded on July 17, 1990 as the Philippines' second ATM consortium when the ATMs of eight banks, PCI Bank (later [[Equitable PCI Bank]], now [[BDO Unibank|Banco de Oro]]), [[Security Bank]], [[Chinabank]], [[Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation|RCBC]], [[Allied Banking Corporation|Allied Bank]](now part of [[Philippine National Bank| PNB]]), [[Metrobank (Philippines)|Metrobank]], International Exchange Bank (now part of [[Union Bank of the Philippines|UnionBank]]) and CityTrust Banking Corp. (now part of [[Bank of the Philippine Islands|BPI]]) formed BancNet. Other members have since joined.

In 1994, BancNet introduced the a point-of-sale system to serve the retail payment requirements of cardholders. In 1997, BancNet started offering website hosting, email and surfing services to member banks at affordable rates.

In 2002, BancNet started its online banking and payment gateway system.

It was during the anniversary business forum of 2002 that BancNet introduced Interbank Funds Transfer, reportedly the first consortium-run automated transfer facility in the region. The product allows real-time, online transfer of money among the members of BancNet using either the payment gateway, the ATM or a cardholder's [[cellular phone]].

A partnership with [[Globe Telecom]], the second largest telecoms company in the Philippines, in 2006 allowed BancNet to expand ATM-like functions to the mobile phones of cardholders. This was followed by a similar agreement in early 2007 with [[Smart Communications]], the dominant telecoms company, for mobile banking.

A Memorandum of Agreement was signed in 2007 with [[Nationlink (interbank network)|Nationlink]], admitting the latter as the first network alliance member of BancNet.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.visayandailystar.com/archives.visayandailystar.com/2007/June/09/businessnews3.htm |title=BancNet, Nationlink sign pact for interconnection |publisher=[[Visayan Daily Star|Daily Star]] |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows all the rural bank members of Nationlink to enjoy the convenience of electronic banking on 8,000 ATMs and more than 10,000 [[Point-of-Sale]] terminals nationwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16813">[[File:Blickensderfer No. 5 , 1902.jpg|thumb|Fine example of an early Blickensderfer No.5 typewriter, dated 1902]]    
The '''Blickensderfer Typewriter''' was invented by George Canfield Blickensderfer (1850–1917) and patented on August 4, 1891. Two models were initially unveiled to the public at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, the Model 1 and the Model 5. His machines were originally intended to compete with larger [[Remington Typewriter Company|Remington]], Hammond and Yost [[typewriters]], and were the first truly portable, full-keyboard typewriters. The design also enabled the typist to see the typed work at a time when most typewriters were understrike machines that concealed the writing. When Blickensderfer unveiled his small Model 5 at the 1893 World's Fair, a stripped-down version of his larger more complex Model 1 machine, these revolutionary features attracted huge crowds and a full order book – many of them from Britain, Germany and  France, whose business machine markets were more highly developed than the United States. 
 
The Blickensderfer typewriters were initially manufactured in a rented factory on Garden Street in Stamford, Connecticut. By 1896, due to strong foreign  demand in particular for his machines, Blickensderfer opened a new and modern factory on Atlantic Street in Stamford. According to an article published by the Stamford Historical Society " Blickensderfer's typewriter...became the world's best seller, and the company became one of the world's largest typewriter manufacturers". The factory employed about 200 people and produced about 10,000 typewriters per year at its peak (1903-1907) until the factory closed in 1919. The first commercially successful model was the No. 5, which sold for $35, compared to the benchmark machines of the day which cost $100 or more. Each new model 5 came in a simple wooden carrying case with an extra typewheel, a dozen ink rolls and a tool kit.

George Blickensderfer's invention dramatically reduced the complexity of the typewriter design. A typical Blick contained only 250 parts, compared to the 2,500 parts of a standard typewriter. It was much smaller, lighter and cheaper than others. Some of the first [[aluminum]] typewriters, marketed as the Blickensderfer 6 and the Blick Featherweight, were made by Blickensderfer, as was the world's first fully [[Typewriter#Electric designs|electric typewriter]], the Blickensderfer Electric.

Instead of the common mechanism with letters on the end of individual type bars connected to the keys, the first Blickensderfer prototype used a cylindrical typewheel with four rows of characters; lower case, upper case, italics and short words embossed on it. It was later modified to three rows of characters: lower case, upper case and a row of numbers and symbols. Depressing a key caused the typewheel to turn so the correct letter was positioned over the paper. As the wheel turned it moved downward, contacting an ink roller prior to striking the paper. This allowed for greater speed in typing as there were no keys to become jammed or stuck together. The interchangeable typewheel principle is very similar to the [[IBM Selectric typewriter|IBM Selectric]] design introduced almost 70 years later in 1961. Like the Selectric, one could easily change the [[typeface]] or  the font style on a Blickensderfer simply by changing the typewheel.

Blickensderfers were also notable for their unique [[keyboard layout]] developed by George Blickensderfer after careful analysis of the English language. The home, or lowest row of keys, contained the [[ETAOIN SHRDLU|most commonly used letters]]. Blickensderfer determined that 70% of the most commonly used letters and 85% of words contained the letters '''DHIATENSOR'''. This positioning allowed the typist to keep his hands on the home row as much as possible, minimizing extraneous hand movement and increasing efficiency. The QWERTY keyboard introduced on the Sholes &amp; Glidden typewriter in 1874 was designed for purely mechanical reasons and the chances of the keys striking each other and jamming was more limited with this configuration. Because the Blickensderfer used the typewheel, the "scientific" keyboard layout could be used for maximum typing efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Instructions for Using the Blickensderfer Typewriter| url = http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/eaa_A0562/| format = | accessdate =  2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blickensderfer typewriters were sold in France under the Dactyle name. The machines were sold in Canada by the Creelman Brothers Company of Georgetown, Ontario. They were also sold and marketed in Great Britain, Germany, New Zealand and Russia. The keyboards and type wheels were available in numerous languages, including French, Spanish, German and Polish. Some machines, called the Oriental, were adapted so the carriage moved from left to right which accommodated Hebrew and Arabic languages. 
  
The company saw much of their European business decline with the onset of World War I, and production and sales were particularly hard hit when the United States joined the war in 1917. As part of the war effort Blickensderfer converted much of his factory to produce munitions for the war, including a machine gun belt feed for the French government and 50 caliber machine gun mounts for aircraft. In the same year a fatal blow was delivered to the company when George Blickensderfer died on August 15, 1917, after a short illness. With the brilliant chief engineer and designer gone, the company could not continue, and the heirs sold the company in 1919. After several unsuccessful years under different ownership, the Remington Typewriter Company acquired the assets, including tools, parts, drawings and intellectual rights from the bankrupt L.R. Roberts Company in 1926. Remington attempted to introduce a modified Blick 5 called the Rem-Blick to the market, but by the end of 1928 the model was discontinued.

==Blickensderfer Typewriter Models==

===Model 5===
[[File:Blickensderfer No. 5 , early model, 1894.jpg|thumb|Very early example of a Blickensderfer No. 5 typewriter dated 1894]]

The first widely successful production model was the Blickensderfer 5, introduced at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago were. Production of the model 5 did not seriously get underway until 1895-1896. The 5 was the first portable, full keyboard, typewriter and came with the DHIATENSOR keyboard as standard or with a QWERTY keyboard available on request. Some of the earliest Blick 5's were sold in [[France]] as the  Dactyle . The Blick 5 was the simplest of all Blickensderfer models and more were produced than any other Blickensderfer machine. About 74,000 or 37% of the 200,000 Blick typewriters produced, were No. 5's and their production continued until 1913, when other models became more popular.

===Model 6 and  Featherweight===
[[File:Blickensderfer Featherweight , 1915.jpg|thumb|Blickensderfer Featherweight typewriter, 1915]]
  
In 1910 George Blickensderfer introduced the Blickensderfer 6, which was cast in aluminum and was essentially a lighter version of the Blickensderfer 5 which used cast iron. The aluminum version also appeared as the Blick Featherweight, which was an improved Model 6 with a backspace mechanism and the ink arm support was modified to an attractive curved folding design. These typewriters weighed only 5 pounds and were widely marketed as the Five-Pound Secretary.

===Model 7===
[[File:Blickensderfer model 7, 1909.jpg|thumb|Blickensderfer model 7, 1909]]

The Model 7, first introduced in 1897, became the deluxe version of the basic No. 5 and was designed to please a greater cross section of the market. The biggest and most obvious difference was the wraparound space bar, which gave the machine a more solid and distinctive look. Blickensderfer also improved the paper scale, added black composite carriage knobs at both ends of the palten, added adjustable margin stops and a bell mechanism designed to be struck by a clapper attached to the inker arm indicating when the carriage was approaching the end of the typed line. The Blick 7 was also mounted on an oak base fitted with an attractive bentwood laminated oak case. About 63,000 Blick No. 7's were produced from 1897 until 1916.

===Blickensderfer Electric===

The Blick Electric was a revolutionary machine and was far ahead of its time when it was first introduced at the Pan-American Exhibition in Buffalo in 1901 following its patent in August 1900 (patent no.656,085). It had all the familiar characteristics of the manual models, plus a QWERTY or a DHIATENSOR keyboard and all the advantages of later electric typewriters, including a light key touch, even typing, and automatic carriage return and line spacing. The machine was powered by an [[Emerson Electric Company|Emerson]] electric motor mounted on the rear and switched on by turning a [[Pin tumbler lock|Yale key]] on the side.[http://www.typewritermuseum.org/collection/index.php3?machine=blickel&amp;cat=ks] The motor ran on 104 Volt 60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC electric current,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamfordhistory.org/bl_elec.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; which was not yet widely standard at the time. (See [[War of Currents]])

It is believed that the Blick Electric was produced from 1901 to 1919. Although a technological and engineering success, it was a commercial failure as at the time many homes and businesses were not wired for electricity. Electricity was primarily used for lighting and therefore not widely available during the daytime.
 
The Blick Electrics were advertised and marketed in both France and Britain, although it is not known how many machines were ultimately sold. 
Very few machines are known to exist today, and they are found with both straight fronts and QWERTY keyboards or curved fronts and DHIATENSOR keyboards.

===Model 8===
 
[[File:Blickensderfer model 8, 1909.jpg|thumb|Blickensderfer model 8, 1909]]

The Blickensderfer 8 introduced in 1908 was the first Blick to boast a tabulator system (see [[Tab stop]]), even though tabulators had been around for some time. This model was a considerable success and more were sold in 1908 than any other model. This machine was more massive and sturdier looking than the 7 with a two-piece typehead casting and a popular backspace mechanism. The tabulator used large nickel-plated levers placed on top of the machine, making it easy to operate. 
Production peaked in 1910 and declined until production ended in 1917. About 20,000 Blick 8's were produced, accounting for about 10% of all Blick models sold.

===Model 9===

The Model 9, believed to be introduced in mid-1910, was similar in appearance to the Model 8, but lacked the nickel plated tabulator keys and also featured a folding ink roller arm support similar to the Blick Featherweight. Only about 10,000 machines were produced, ending in 1919.

==Innovation and Technology==
On August 4, 1891, after several prototypes, Blickensderfer patented The Blickensderfer Type Writing Machine. The central component was the use of the cylindrical shaped interchangeable type element which he initially patented on July 15, 1890. An earlier variation to Blickensderfer's typewheel was introduced on the [http://www.antiquetypewriters.com/collection/typewriter.asp?Crandall%201#.WA6uezKZOCc Crandall 1 typewriter] in 1883 but Blickensderfer's genius was in the use of the typewheel combined with the simplicity and the small size of his machine. This invention was unlike anything else on the market and was considered a mechanical marvel that took typewriter engineering to a new level. Striking a key turned the wheel to the appropriate orientation while inking the typeface as it tipped downward past the ink roller to strike the paper. Holding the Cap or Fig keys shifted the typewheel along its axis to use either the middle row, for capital letters, or the lower row, for special characters and numbers.

Industrial production in the 1890s was not highly automated and assembly was done completely by hand. This allowed for easy design changes and improvements to the production process. Blickensderfer continued to improve his machines and a number of new patents were filed for the Blick 5 up to June 1, 1897, when the machine largely remained the same for the balance of its production life. Blickensderfer continued to invent new machines until his death, including the Blick Electric and various standard machines with the Blick 9 being his last major new model.

The typewheel, like the later typeball of the [[IBM Selectric typewriter]], was the central component of all the Blick machines. It could be easily removed, allowing users to select a large variety of fonts and typeface. Later in the companies production history the basic machines keyboards could easily be adapted to other languages at the Blickensderfer factory simply by changing the removable keytop covers and adding the corresponding language typewheel.

==The Scientific Keyboard==

[[File:Blickensderfer "scientific" keyboard.jpg|thumb|Blickensderfer "scientific" keyboard]]

One unique feature of the Blickensderfer typewriter was the scientific or DHIATENSOR keyboard. The DHIATENSOR layout is shown below (with alphanumeric characters only): Blickensderfer analyzed the English language and proposed a unique and more efficient keyboard based on his research. He determined that the ten most frequently used letter were A,D,E,H,I,N,O,R,S and T and were used in about 70% of written text and in about 85% of all words. The middle row contained letters that occurred 24% of the time and the top row about 6%. Blickensderfer offered the scientific keyboard in the hopes that his more efficient system would replace the clumsy but widely used QWERTY or universal keyboard developed by Sholes and Glidden in 1874. Unfortunately for Blickensderfer, no other typewriter manufacturer adopted the scientific keyboard and Blickensderfer had no choice but to offer the universal keyboard on all his machines as an option. Toward the end of the company's existence, most machines were sold with the universal keyboard. There were modifications to the layout made for [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Polish language|Polish]].

::[[File:KB Blickensderfer.svg|470px|DHIATENSOR layout (showing alphanumeric characters only)]]

In 1936 Prof August Dvorak proposed a similar keyboard layout with a more logical design to the QWERTY keyboard. His theory was similar to Blickensderfer's as he tried to minimize the distance then typists fingers travelled. He proposed the same common letters as Blickensderfer in the ''middle row'' of his keyboard  with the exception of the R which he replaced with a punctuation key. The [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]] keyboard continues to have a small but loyal following to this day and is available on most major operating systems.

A '''burrowing vehicle''' is a (manned or unmanned) vehicle that would travel through the earth/rock as it moves, while underground. The [[Afeka College of Engineering]] is testing &lt;ref&gt;http://www.military.com/video/logistics-and-supplies/military-equipment/israel-creates-unmanned-burrowing-vehicle/3967206812001&lt;/ref&gt; an autonomous drone vehicle which could burrow underground and destroy hidden bunkers or underground areas/dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am_pQG5zWRg&lt;/ref&gt;

== Robotic Underground Munition ==
In 2010, the Weapons and Capabilities Division (RD-CXW) of the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] (DTRA) submitted a [[request for information]] (RFI) regarding technologies suitable for use in the Robotic Underground Munition (RUM).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1021a87dd2c2cfcef17d34e4258ae0cd&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0|title=Request for Information (RFI) for Robotic Underground Munitiion (RUM) Technology - Federal Business Opportunities: Opportunities|website=www.fbo.gov|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the RFI, "the RUM would be a one-time use, air-delivered, highly mobile vehicle having certain characteristics similar to an unmanned ground vehicle." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The design is to be able to "avoid, traverse, neutralize or defeat natural and man-made obstacles",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/15/mole_missile/&lt;/ref&gt; all of which would be encountered in an attempt to break fortified structures. According to ''Popular Science'', "One of DTRA's missions is keeping weapons of mass destruction in check, so it's probably safe to assume the main objective here is to be able to locate and, if necessary, destroy underground weapons caches or development sites." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-03/autonomous-bot-burrows-underground-deliver-deadly-payloads&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2383">The '''Business Software Association of Australia''' (BSAA, founded in 1989&lt;ref name="bsaahistory" /&gt;) was{{clarify|date=January 2016|post-text= - Is it still known under this name, even though it's now a BSAA branch?}} an industry association in [[Australia]] of commercial software producers and corporations that advocated software copyright compliancy and assisted the litigation of copyright infringement through support and funding.  The BSAA typically retained the law firm Mallesons Stephen Jacques (a particularly notable Australian law firm&lt;ref&gt;Law500{{clarify|date=January 2016|post-text= - Not enough data for a reference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to investigate and litigate its interests.

The association published a range of auditing tools and provided information on software copyright  and license compliancy.

The association had been particularly more active in the defense of copyright infringement since January 2006 when Australian Copyright law was changed to make the running of an enterprise with infringing software a criminal offense.

As of January 2007, the BSAA is now the Australian branch of the [[Business Software Alliance]].&lt;ref name="bsaahistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsaaustralia.com.au/bsaaweb/main/index.php?ch_table=link1&amp;PID=14&amp;SID=CHmWmJBOiJdokvur&amp;loc=1|title=Business Software Association of Australia - History|publisher=Business Software Alliance|accessdate=2009-06-05}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The full members of the BSAA were [[Adobe Systems]], [[Microsoft]], [[Computer Associates]], [[Symantec]], [[Autodesk]] and [[Apple Computer]].

== Criticisms ==

Like most industry associations that support litigation of copyright matters, the BSAA was occasionally mentioned as being draconian, although it is considerably more measured in action it takes than its counterparts in the UK and United States.  

Associations such as the BSAA are also sometimes considered as an example of a 'good hand, bad hand' tactic as its members can actively pursue their interests through the association and draw criticism to the association rather than themselves as members.

'''Chicken eyeglasses''', also known as '''chickens specs''', '''chicken goggles''', generically as '''pick guards''' and under other names,&lt;ref name="Ask"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Indiana Gazette|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=112048981|date=January 22, 1999|title=Ask Anne &amp; Nan: Eyeglasses For Chickens|page=9|format=Fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; were small eyeglasses made for [[chicken]]s intended to prevent [[feather pecking]] and [[Cannibalism in poultry|cannibalism]]. They differ from [[Blinders (poultry)|blinders]] as they allowed the bird to see forward whereas blinders do not.  One variety used [[Rose (color)|rose-colored]] lenses as the coloring was thought to prevent a chicken wearing them from recognizing blood on other chickens which may increase the tendency for [[Abnormal behaviour of birds in captivity|abnormal injurious behavior]]. They were [[Mass production|mass-produced]] and sold throughout the United States as early as the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune1986"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-07-18/entertainment/8602220060_1_loyl-stromberg-barnyard-chicken-chicken-related|title=Blinders Make A Spectacle For Chicken-hearted Collectors|date=July 18, 1986|last=Gold|first=Anita}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~haefner/glasses/ |title=Lee's Summit Historical Society Museum Glasses for Chickens Unity Village |publisher=Freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and purpose==
Chicken eyeglasses were often made from celluloid or aluminum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Charleston Gazette|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=40326100|date=August 11, 1944|title=Ask the Gazette|page=6|format=Fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and typically consisted of "two oval panels that fit over the upper beak of the chicken. A pin is put through the nostril to-hold the oval pieces in place."&lt;ref name="Ask" /&gt; Different designs were produced that attached to the chicken's head in different ways. Some were held in place by a strap,&lt;ref name="chicagotribune1986"/&gt; some by small hooks into the [[nares]] (nostrils) and some by piercing the bone [[nasal septum|septum]] between the nostrils with a [[Split pin|cotter pin]].&lt;ref name="Company History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalband.com/nbtcohis.htm |title=Company History |publisher=Nationalband.com |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the piercing of tissue, this last type of design is illegal in some countries.{{Cref2|fn. 1}} 

Some versions of the devices had lenses that were semi- or fully transparent whereas others were tinted, often red- or rose-colored.  Other designs were [[Blinders (poultry)|blinders]] which are opaque and completely prevent forward vision.&lt;ref name="Ask" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Altoona"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Altoona Mirror|last=Helsel|first=Marge|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=70228088|date=December 17, 1980|title=Old Chicks Learn New Tricks|page=8|format=Fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intended purposes of chicken eyeglasses were to prevent aggressive pecking, [[Cannibalism (poultry)|cannibalism]] and [[feather pecking]].

Chicken eyeglasses are an alternative to [[debeaking|beak trimming]], which is the removal of approximately one-third of the beak by a cold or heated blade, or an infrared beam, usually when chicks are 1-day old.  This is often effective in reducing pecking injuries, but causes pain and has significant effects on chicken welfare.&lt;ref name="Altoona" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gentle|first=M.J. |author2=Hughes, B.O. |author3=Hubrecht, R.C.|year=1982|title=The effect of beak-trimming on food-intake, feeding behaviour and body weight in adult hens|journal=Applied Animal Ethology|volume=8|pages=147–157|doi=10.1016/0304-3762(82)90140-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=I.J.H. |author2=Slee, G.S. |author3=Seawright, E. |author4=Breward, J.|year=1989|title=Behavioural consequences of partial beak amputation (beak trimming) in poultry|journal=British Poultry Science|volume=30|pages=479–488|doi=10.1080/00071668908417172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gentle|first=M.J. |author2=Hunter, L.N. |author3=Waddington, D.|year=1991|title=The onset of pain related behaviours following partial beak amputation in the chicken|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=128|pages=113–116|doi=10.1016/0304-3940(91)90772-l}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gentle|first=M.J. |author2=Hughes, B.O. |author3=Fox, A. |author4=Waddington, D.|year=1997|title=Behavioural and anatomical consequences of two beak trimming methods in 1- and 10-d-old domestic chicks|journal=British Poultry Science|volume=38|pages=453–463|doi=10.1080/00071669708418022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red-tinted lenses===
Red-tinted lenses were considered to be effective in reducing internecine pecking because they disguise the color of blood.&lt;ref name="Altoona" /&gt; As summed up in a 1953 article in Indiana's ''National Road Traveler'' newspaper, "The deep rose-colored plastic lenses make it impossible for the cannibal [chicken] to see blood on the other chickens, although permitting it to see the grain on the ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=National Road Traveler|last=Nussbaum|first=Lowel|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=97319185|date=June 25, 1953|title=Sunglasses for Chicken Purchased Here|page=5|format=Fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmer Haas of the National Band &amp; Tag Company, a major producer of rose-colored chicken eyeglasses, whose grandfather had "devised wire frames for chickens in 1902",&lt;ref name="Fireplug"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Journal News|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=71978502|date=May 15, 1977|title=Fireplug Dog Tags Hit Dust|page=A-2|format=Fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that he believed the purported blood-masking effect of the rose coloring was a myth: "the firm added the rose colored glasses because it indulged the chicken owners&amp;nbsp;... [c]hickens are color blind".&lt;ref name="Fireplug" /&gt; (In fact, chickens, like other birds, have good [[Bird vision|color vision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|date=October 13, 1999|author=D. Osorio,*, M. Vorobyev and C. D. Jones|title=Colour vision of domestic chicks|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/202/21/2951.full.pdf|page=2951}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  The firm had added the rose-colored feature to its glasses in 1939 under the brand name "Anti-Pix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalband.com/nbtcohis.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63JLFaZgj?url=http://www.nationalband.com/nbtcohis.htm |accessdate=December 13, 2011 |title=Advertisement: Glasses for Chickens? |publisher=National Band &amp; Tag Company |archivedate=November 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This variety of eyeglasses was more complicated than others because the red lenses were fixed to a hinge at the top of the frame. This meant that as the hen lowered its head to feed, the lens swung out giving the hen an unobstructed view of the ground.  When the hen raised her head, as she would during aggression, the lens would swing down giving the hen a red tinted perception of the environment.&lt;ref name="Anti-pix"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenaturalpoultryfarmingguide.org/2013/04/23/like-glasses-for-chickens/|title=Like glasses for chickens|publisher=The Natural Poultry Farming Guide|accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rose-colored [[contact lenses]], rather than eyeglasses, have also been proposed to reduce cannibalism in chickens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=He sees fortune in chicken contact lens|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1989/11/23/page/211/article/he-sees-fortune-in-chicken-contact-lens|date=November 23, 1989|author=Levine, S.|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Patent detail-Eye protector for chickens.png|200px|thumb|Detail from a 1903 patent filed by Andrew Jackson Jr.]]
A form of chicken eyeglasses was first patented in 1903 by Andrew Jackson Jr. of [[Munich, Tennessee|Munich]], [[Tennessee]], as an "Eye-protector for chickens".&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|730,918}}, Application: December 10, 1902; issued: June 16, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the U.S. they were available through the mail order company [[Sears-Roebuck]], or through chicken feed stores for a few cents.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AWUkcqCHwVAC Fun with science: 46 entertaining demonstrations]'', George Barr, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; The eyeglasses are no longer produced by the National Band &amp; Tag Company, but are sought as [[Collectable|collector's items]].&lt;ref name="Company History"/&gt; 

Using chicken eyeglasses was still practiced in 1973, evident by a report in Illinois' ''The Hawk-Eye'' newspaper that a farmer had 8,000 chickens fitted with the rose-colored variety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Hawk-Eye|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=137058413|date=November 21, 1973|title=Chicken Specs Prevent Pecks|page=24|format=Fee required}}{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/glassesoffers |title=Glasses offers}}&lt;/ref&gt; One inventor of a form of the glasses proposed legislation in [[Kansas]] to require ''all'' chickens in the state to be fitted with glasses, but his campaign was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Br5XAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FPQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6665,1205816|page=20|newspaper=The Spokane Chronicle|title=Invents Goat That Bucks|date=June 22, 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
On January 16, 1955, Sam Nadler of the National Farm Equipment Company of Brooklyn appeared on [[CBS]]' popular primetime television show, ''[[What's My Line?]]''&lt;ref name="WML"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of What's My Line? episode #241 |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/whats-my-line/episode-241-95198/ |publisher=tv.com (CBS Interactive) |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63JQ3vJZA?url=http://www.tv.com/shows/whats-my-line/episode-241-95198/ |archivedate=November 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was in the format of a [[guessing game]], in which a panel attempted to determine the line (occupation) of contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Masterman|first=Len|title=Television Mythologies: Stars, Shows and Signs|publisher=Routledge|year=1987|page=21|isbn=978-0-203-99443-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6RMykjK_lMC&amp;pg=PA21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Show officials listed Mr. Nadler's occupation for the audience as "sells 'eyeglasses' for chickens". After the panel was  unsuccessful in guessing his occupation,  Mr. Nadler's identity was revealed and he stated that his company sold 2–3 million pairs of chicken eyeglasses per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|series=What's My Line?|network=CBS|airdate=January 16, 1955|season=6|episode=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''What's My Line?''{{'}}s director, Frank Heller, said in 1958 that the show's "most unusual occupation" over its then eight-season run was "...the gentleman who makes eye glasses for chickens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Big Spring Daily Herald|last=Mercer|first=Charles|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=96219086|date=March 16, 1958|title=TV Panel Bares Gamut of Jobs|page=5-D|format=Fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohn]], is a series of purification steps with the purpose of extracting [[human serum albumin|albumin]] from [[blood plasma]]. The process is based on the differential [[solubility]] of albumin and other plasma proteins based on [[pH]], [[ethanol]] concentration, temperature, ionic strength, and protein concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Kirk -Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th edition, vol 11, 990-1021|last=Foster|first=Peter|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=990-1021}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="CohnStrong1946"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohn|first1=E.

This makes it the final product to be precipitated, or separated from its solution in a solid form. Albumin was an excellent substitute for human plasma in World War Two. When administered to wounded soldiers or other patients with blood loss, it helped expand the volume of blood and led to speedier recovery. Cohn's method was gentle enough that isolated albumin protein retained its biological activity.&lt;ref name="Surgenor"&gt;Surgenor, Douglas. Edwin J. Cohn and the Development of Protein Chemistry. Center for Blood Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process details ==
During the operations, the  ethanol concentration change from zero initially to 40%. The pH decreases from neutral at 7 to more acidic at 4.8 over the course of the fractionation. The temperature starts at room temperature and decreases to &amp;minus;5 degrees Celsius. Initially, the blood is frozen. There are five major fractions. Each fraction ends with a specific precipitate. These precipitates are the separate fractions.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, James R. Blood Separation and Plasma Fractionation. Wiley-Liss. 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractions I, II, and III are precipitated out at earlier stages. The conditions of the earlier stages are 8% ethanol, pH 7.2, &amp;minus;3&amp;nbsp;°C, and 5.1% protein for Fraction I; 25% ethanol, pH of 6.9, &amp;minus;5&amp;nbsp;°C, and 3% protein. The albumin remains in the supernatant fraction during the solid/liquid extraction under these conditions. Fraction IV has several unwanted proteins that need to be removed. In order to do this, the conditions are varied in order to precipitate the proteins out. The conditions to precipitate these proteins are raising the ethanol concentration from 18 to 40% and raising the pH from 5.2 to 5.8. Finally, albumin is located in fraction V. The precipitation of albumin is done by reducing the pH to 4.8, which is near the pI of the protein, and maintaining the ethanol concentration to be 40%, with a protein concentration of 1%. Thus, only 1% of the original plasma remains in the fifth fraction.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

However, albumin is lost at each process stage, with roughly 20% of the albumin   lost through [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] stages before fraction V. In order to purify the albumin, there is an extraction with water, and adjustment to 10% ethanol, pH of 4.5 at &amp;minus;3&amp;nbsp;°C. Any precipitate formed here is done so by filtration and is an impurity. These precipitates are discarded. Reprecipitation, or repetition of the precipitation step in order to improve purity, is done so by raising ethanol concentration back to 40% from the extraction stage. The pH is 5.2 and it is conducted at &amp;minus;5&amp;nbsp;°C. Several variations of Cohn fraction were created to account for lower cost and higher yield. Generally, if the yield is high, the purity is lowered, to roughly 85-90%.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Slide3.gif|right]] --&gt;

== Products other than albumin==
Cohn was able to start the Plasma Fractionation Laboratory after he was given massive funding from the government agencies and the private pharmaceutical companies. This led to the fractionation of human plasma. Human plasma proved to have several useful components other than albumin. Human [[blood plasma fractionation]] yielded [[human serum albumin]], Serum Gamma [[Globulin]], [[Fibrinogen]], [[Thrombin]], and Blood Group Globulins.&lt;ref name="Birnie"&gt;Birnie, G.D. Subcellular components: Preparation and Fractionation. Butterworth. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  The fibrinogen and thrombin fractions were further combined during the War  into additional products, including liquid [[Fibrin Sealant]],&lt;ref name="Cohn"&gt;Cohn, E.J. The history of plasma fractionation. In Advances in Military Medicine, Andrus et al. Eds. Little, Brown &amp; Co, 1948.,&lt;/ref&gt; solid [[Fibrin]] Foam and a [[Fibrin]] Film.&lt;ref name="MacPhee"&gt;MacPhee, M.J. et al. Tissue Sealants available today. In Tissue Glues in Cosmetic Surgery, Saltz &amp; Toriumi Eds., Quality Medical Publishing, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
Gamma Globulins are found in Fractions II and III and proved to be essential in treating measles for soldiers. Gamma globulin also was useful in treatment for polio, but did not have much effect in treating mumps or scarlet fever. Most importantly, the gamma globulins were useful in modifying and preventing infectious hepatitis during the Second World War. It eventually became a treatment for children exposed to this type of hepatitis.&lt;ref name="Birnie"/&gt;

Liquid fibrin sealant was used in treating burn victims, including some from the attack at Pearl Harbor, to attach skin grafts with an increased success rate.&lt;ref name="Cohn"/&gt; It was also found  helpful at re-connecting or anastomosing severed nerves.&lt;ref name="Cohn"/&gt;  Fibrin foam and thrombin were used to control blood vessel oozing especially in liver injuries and near tumors. It also minimized bleeding from large veins as well as dealing with blood vessel malformations within the brain. Fibrin film was used to stop bleeding in various surgical applications, including neurosurgery.&lt;ref name="Cohn"/&gt; However, it was not useful in controlling arterial bleeding.&lt;ref name="Birnie"/&gt;  The first fibrinogen/fibrin based product capable of stopping arterial hemorrhage  was the "Fibrin Sealant Bandage" or "Hemostatic Dressing (HD)" invented by [[Martin MacPhee]] at the American Red Cross in the early 1990s, and tested in collaboration with the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name="pmid9291993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holcomb JB, Pusateri AE, Hess JR, Hetz SP, Harris RA, Tock BB, Drohan WN, MacPhee MJ | title = Implications of new dry fibrin sealant technology for trauma surgery | journal = Surg.

== Process variations==
The Gerlough method, developed in 1955 improved process economics by reducing the consumption of ethanol. Instead of 40% in certain steps, Gerlough used 20% ethanol for precipitation. This is especially used for Fractions II and III. In addition, Gerlough combined the two fractions with IV into one step to reduce the number of fractionations required. While this method proved less expensive, it was not adopted by industry because of this combination of fractions II, III, and IV, for fear of mixing and high impurities.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Graham, J.M., Rickwood, D.  Subcellular Fractionation, a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hink method developed in 1957. This method gave higher yields through recovery of some of the plasma proteins discarded in the Fractions of IV. The improved yields, however, balanced by the  lower purities obtained,  within the 85% range.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;

The Mulford method, akin to the Hink, used the fractions II and III supernatant as the last step before finishing and heat treatment. The method combined fractions IV and V, but in this case, the albumin would not be as pure, although the yields may be higher.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;

Another variation was developed by Kistler and Nitschmann, to provide a purer form of albumin, even though   offset by lower yields. Similar to Gerlough, the Precipitate A, which is equivalent to Cohn’s Fraction II and III, was done at a lower ethanol concentration of 19%, but the pH, in this case, was also lower to 5.85. Also similar to Gerlough and Mulford, the fraction IV was combined and precipitated at conditions of 40% ethanol, pH of 5.85, and temperature of &amp;minus;8 degrees C. The albumin, which is recovered in fraction V, is recovered in Precipitate C at a pH adjustment to 4.8. Similar to the Cohn Process, the albumin is purified by extraction into water followed by precipitation of the impurities at 10% ethanol, pH 4.6, and &amp;minus;3 degrees C. Akin to the Cohn Process, the precipitate formed here is filtered out and discarded. Then Precipitate C (fraction V) is reprecipitated at pH 5.2 and stored as a paste at &amp;minus;40 degrees C.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt; This process has been more widely accepted because it separates the fractions and makes each stage independent of each other.

Another variation involved a heat ethanol fractionation. It was originally developed to inactivate the hepatitis virus. In this process, recovery of high yield, high purity albumin is the most important goal, while the other plasma proteins are neglected. In order to make sure the albumin does not denature in the heat, there are stabilizers such as sodium octanoate, which allow the albumin to tolerate higher temperatures for long periods. In heat ethanol, the plasma is heat treated at 68 degrees C with sodium octanoate with 9% ethanol at pH of 6.5. This results in improved albumin recovery with yields of 90%, and purities of 100%. It is not nearly as expensive as cold ethanol procedures such as the Cohn Process. One drawback is the presences of new antigens due to possible heat denaturation of the albumin. In addition, the other plasma proteins have practical uses and to neglect them would not be worth it. Finally, the expensive heat treatment vessels offset the lower cost compared to the cold ethanol format that do not need it. For these reasons, several companies haven not adopted this method even though it has the most impressive results. However, one prominent organization that uses it is the German Red Cross.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;

The latest variation was developed by Hao in 1979. This method is significantly simplified compared to the Cohn Process. Its goal is to create high albumin yields as long as albumin is the sole product. Through a two-stage process, impurities are precipitated directly from fractions II and III supernatant at 42% ethanol, pH 5.8, temperature &amp;minus;5 degrees C, 1.2% protein, and 0.09 ionic strength. Fraction V is precipitated at pH 4.8. Fractions I, II, III, and IV are [[coprecipitation|coprecipitated]] at 40% ethanol, with pH of 5.4 to 7.0, and temperature &amp;minus;3 to &amp;minus;7 degrees C. Fraction V is then precipitated at pH 4.8 and &amp;minus;10 degrees C. The high yields are due to a combination of a simplified process, with lower losses due to coprecipitation, and use of filtration. Higher purities were also achieved at 98% because of the higher ethanol levels, but the yields were lowered with the high purity.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;

More recent methods involve the use of [[Chromatography in Blood Processing|chromatography]].&lt;ref name="TanakaShigueoka1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tanaka|first1=K.|last2=Shigueoka|first2=E.M.|last3=Sawatani|first3=E.|last4=Dias|first4=G.A.|last5=Arashiro|first5=F.|last6=Campos|first6=T.C.X.B.|last7=Nakao|first7=H.C.|title=Purification of human albumin by the combination of the method of Cohn with liquid chromatography|journal=Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research|volume=31|issue=11|year=1998|pages=1383–1388|issn=1678-4510|doi=10.1590/S0100-879X1998001100003|pmid=9921272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences of Cohn process==
The Cohn process was a major development in the field of blood fractionation. It has several practical uses in treating diseases such as hepatitis and polio. It was most useful during the Second World War where soldiers recovered at a faster rate because of the transfusions with albumin. The Cohn Process has been modified over the years as seen above. In addition, it has influenced other processes with the blood fractionation industry. This has led to new forms of fractionation such as chromatographic plasma fractionation in ion exchange and albumin finishing processes. In general, the Cohn Process and its variations have given a huge boost to and serve as a foundation for the fractionation industry to this day.&lt;ref name="Petz"&gt;Petz, L.D, Swisher S. Clinical Practice of Transfusion Medicine. Churchill-Livingstone. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the process has not been studied well because it is archaic. Most importantly, it has never been modernized by manufacturing companies. In addition, the conventional process can be environmentally unfriendly because ethanol is a highly flammable substance. It is unsanitary because of the open vessels and tanks; thus, the possibility of contamination is high. The cold ethanol format may be too gentle to kill off certain viruses that require heat inactivation. Since this process remains unchanged for so long, several built-in inefficiencies and inconsistencies affect the economics of the process for pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies.&lt;ref name="Petz"/&gt;  One exception to this was the application in Scotland of continuous-flow processing instead of batch processing. This process was devised at the Protein Fractionation Centre (PFC), the plasma fractionation facility of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS). This process involved in-line monitoring and control of pH and temperature, with flow control of plasma and ethanol streams using precision gear pumps, all under computerised feedback control . As a result, Cohn Fractions I+II+III, IV and V were produced in a few hours, rather than over many days. The continuous-flow preparation of cryoprecipitate was subsequently integrated into the process upstream of Cohn Fractionation.&lt;ref name="pmid26610795"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foster PR | title = The manufacture of blood plasma products in Scotland: a brief history | journal = Scott Med J | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–41 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26610795 | doi = 10.1177/0036933015619311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, this process still serves as a major foundation for the blood industry in general and its influence can be seen as it is referred to in the development of newer methods. Although it has its drawbacks depending on the variation, the Cohn Process’ main advantage is its practical uses and its utility within pharmacological and medical industries.

In electrical [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signalling]] an analog '''current loop''' is used where a device must be monitored or controlled remotely over a pair of conductors. Only one current level can be present at any time.

A major application of current loops is the industry [[de facto standard]] 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA current loop for [[process control]] applications, where they are extensively used to carry signals from process [[instrumentation]] to [[PID controller]]s, [[SCADA]] systems, and [[programmable logic controllers]] (PLCs). They are also used to transmit controller outputs to the modulating field devices such as [[control valves]]. These loops have the advantages of simplicity and noise immunity, and have a large international user and equipment supplier base. Some 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA field devices can be powered by the current loop itself, removing the need for separate power supplies, and the "smart" [[Highway Addressable Remote Transducer Protocol|HART protocol]] uses the loop for communications between field devices and controllers. Various [[List of automation protocols|automation protocols]] may replace analog current loops, but 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA is still a principal industrial standard.

==Process control 4–20 mA loops==
[[File:Analogue control loop evolution.png|thumb|Showing the evolution of analogue control loop signalling from the pneumatic era to the electronic era.]]
[[File:Smart current loop positioner.png|thumb|Example of current loops used for sensing and control transmission. Specific example of a smart valve positioner is shown.]]
In industrial [[process control]], [[analog signal|analog]] 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA current loops are commonly used for electronic signalling, with the two values of 4 &amp; 20&amp;nbsp;mA representing 0–100% of the range of measurement or control.  These loops are used both for carrying sensor information from field instrumentation, and carrying control signals to the process modulating devices, such as a valve.

The key advantages of the current loop are:

* The loop can often power the remote device, with power supplied by the controller, thus removing need for power cabling. Many instrumentation manufacturers produce 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA sensors which are "loop powered".
* The "live" or "elevated" zero of 4&amp;nbsp;mA allows powering of the device even with no process signal output from the field transmitter. 
* The accuracy of the signal is not affected by voltage drop in the interconnecting wiring.
* It has high noise immunity as it is low impedance circuit usually through twisted pair conductors.
* It is self-monitoring; currents less than 3.8&amp;nbsp;mA or more than 20.5&amp;nbsp;mA are taken to indicate a fault.&lt;ref&gt;NAMUR standard NE 043 "Standardisation of the Signal Level for the Failure Information of Digital Transmitters"&lt;/ref&gt;
* It can be carried over long cables up to the limit of the resistance for the voltage used.
* In line displays can be inserted and powered by the loop, as long as total allowable loop resistance is not exceeded.
* Easy conversion to voltage using a resistor.
* Loop powered "I to P" (current to pressure) converters can convert the 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA signal to a 3–15&amp;nbsp;psi pneumatic output for control valves, allowing easy integration of 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA signals into existing pneumatic plant.

Field instrumentation measurements are such as [[pressure]], [[temperature]], level, [[Volumetric flow rate|flow]], [[pH]] or other process variables. A current loop can also be used to control a valve positioner or other output [[actuator]]. Since input terminals of instruments may have one side of the current loop input tied to the chassis ground (earth), analog isolators may be required when connecting several instruments in series.

The relationship between current value and process variable measurement is set by calibration, which assigns different ranges of engineering units to the span between 4 and 20&amp;nbsp;mA. The mapping between engineering units and current can be inverted, so that 4&amp;nbsp;mA represents the maximum and 20&amp;nbsp;mA the minimum.

===Active and passive devices===
Depending on the source of current for the loop, devices may be classified as ''active'' (supplying or "sourcing" power) or ''passive'' (relying on or "sinking" loop power). For example, a [[chart recorder]] may provide loop power to a pressure transmitter. The pressure transmitter modulates the current on the loop to send the signal to the strip chart recorder, but does not in itself supply power to the loop and so is passive.  Another loop may contain two passive chart recorders, a passive pressure transmitter, and a 24 V battery. (The battery is the active device). Note that a ''4-wire'' instrument has a power supply input separate from the current loop.

Panel mount displays and chart recorders are commonly termed 'indicator devices' or 'process monitors'. Several passive indicator devices may be connected in series, but a loop must have only one transmitter device and only one power source (active device).

===Evolution of analogue control signals===
[[Image:Pl control valve.jpg|thumb|right|Control valve with pneumatic diaphragm actuator and "smart" 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA positioner which will also feed back the actual valve position and status over the current loop.]]

The 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA convention was born in the 1950s out of the earlier highly successful 3–15&amp;nbsp;psi pneumatic control signal standard, when electronics became cheap and reliable enough to emulate the older standard  electrically. The 3–15&amp;nbsp;psi standard had the same features of being able to power some remote devices, and have a "live" zero. However the 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA standard was better suited to the electronic controllers then being developed.

The transition was gradual and has extended into the 21st century, due to the huge installed base of 3–15&amp;nbsp;psi devices. As the operation of pneumatic valves over motorised valves has many cost and reliability advantages, pneumatic actuation is still an industry standard. To allow the construction of hybrid systems, where the 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA is generated by the controller, but allows the use of pneumatic valves, a range of current to pressure (I to P) converters are available from manufacturers. These are usually local to the control valve and convert 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA to 3–15&amp;nbsp;psi (or 0.2–1.0&amp;nbsp;bar). This signal is then fed to the valve actuator or more commonly, a pneumatic positioner. The positioner is a dedicated controller which has a mechanical linkage to the actuator movement. This ensures that problems of friction are overcome and the valve control element moves to the desired position. It also allows the use of higher air pressures for valve actuation.

With the development of cheap industrial micro-processors, "smart" valve positioners have become available since the mid-1980s and are very popular for new installations. These include an I to P converter, plus valve position and condition monitoring. These latter are fed back over the current loop to the controller, using such as the [[Highway Addressable Remote Transducer Protocol|HART]] protocol.

==Long circuits==
Analog current loops were historically occasionally carried between buildings by [[dry pair]]s in telephone cables leased from the local telephone company. 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA loops were more common in the days of analog telephony. These circuits require end-to-end direct current (DC) continuity, and unless a dedicated wire pair was hardwired, their use ceased with the introduction of semiconductor switching. DC continuity is not available over a microwave radio, optical fibre, or a multiplexed telephone circuit connection. 
Basic DC circuit theory shows that the current is the same all along the line. It was common to see 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA circuits that had loop lengths in miles or circuits working over telephone cable pairs that were longer than ten thousand feet end-to-end. There are still legacy systems in place using this technology. In [[Bell System]] circuits, voltages up to 125&amp;nbsp;VDC were employed.

==Discrete control==
Discrete control functions can be represented by discrete levels of current sent over a loop. This would allow multiple control functions to be operated over a single pair of wires. Currents required for a specific function vary from one application or manufacturer to another. There is no specific current that is tied to a single meaning. It is almost universal that 0&amp;nbsp;mA indicates the circuit has failed. In the case of a fire alarm, 6&amp;nbsp;mA could be normal, 15&amp;nbsp;mA could mean a fire has been detected, and 0&amp;nbsp;mA would produce a trouble indication, telling the monitoring site the alarm circuit had failed.  Some devices, such as [[two-way radio]] remote control consoles, can reverse the polarity of currents and can multiplex audio onto a DC current.

These devices can be employed for any remote control need a designer might imagine. For example, a current loop could actuate an evacuation [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]] or command synchronized [[traffic signals]].

===Two-way radio use===
[[Image:T1380 remote.png|thumb|right|230px|A [[Motorola]] T-1300 series [[remote control]] is built in a [[telephone]] housing. The dial is replaced with a [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] and volume control. This remote control uses a two-wire circuit to control a [[base station]].]]Current loop circuits are one possible way used to control radio [[base station]]s at distant sites. The two-way radio industry calls this type of remote control '''DC remote'''. This name comes from the need for DC circuit continuity between the control point and the radio [[base station]]. A current loop remote control saves the cost of extra pairs of wires between the operating point and the radio transceiver.  Some equipment, such as the Motorola MSF-5000 base station, uses currents below 4&amp;nbsp;mA for some functions. An alternative type, the [[tone remote]], is more complex but requires only an audio path between control point and base station.&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|6950653|"Scanning tone remote adapter for land-mobile radio dispatch for use with dispersed dispatch stations"}} (The patent does not describe this tone remote but confirms the use of the phrase to describe this system of signaling.)&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a [[Taxicab|taxi]] [[Dispatcher|dispatch]] base station might be physically located on the rooftop of an eight-story building. The taxi company office might be in the basement of a different building nearby. The office would have a remote control unit that would operate the taxi company base station over a current loop circuit. The circuit would normally be over a telephone line or similar wiring. Control function currents come from the remote control console at the dispatch office end of a circuit. In two-way radio use, an idle circuit would normally have no current present.

In [[two-way radio]] use, radio manufacturers use different currents for specific functions. Polarities are changed to get more possible functions over a single circuit. For example, imagine one possible scheme where the presence of these currents cause the base station to change state:

* no current means ''receive on channel 1'', (the default).
* +6 mA might mean ''transmit on channel 1'' 
* −6 mA might mean ''stay in receive mode but switch to channel 2''. So long as the −6&amp;nbsp;mA current were present, the remote base station would continue to receive on channel 2. 
* −12 mA might command the base station to ''transmit on channel 2''.

This circuit is polarity-sensitive. If a telephone company cable splicer accidentally reversed the conductors, selecting channel 2 would lock the transmitter on.

Each current level could close a set of contacts, or operate solid-state logic, at the other end of the circuit. That contact closure caused a change of state on the controlled device. Some remote control equipment could have options set to allow compatibility between manufacturers. That is, a base station that was configured to transmit with a +18&amp;nbsp;mA current could have options changed to (instead) make it transmit when +6&amp;nbsp;mA was present.

In two-way radio use, AC signals were also present on the circuit pair. If the base station were idle, receive audio would be sent over the line from the base station to the dispatch office. In the presence of a transmit command current, the remote control console would send audio to be transmitted. The voice of the user in the dispatch office would be modulated and superimposed over the DC current that caused the transmitter to operate.

'''Data cleansing''' or '''data cleaning''' is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate [[Storage record|records]] from a record set, [[Table (database)|table]], or [[database]] and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the [[dirty data|dirty]] or coarse data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 2013 |last1=Wu |first1 = S. |title= A review on coarse warranty data and analysis | journal = Reliability Engineering and System |volume = 114 |pages=1–11 |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832013000100 |doi=10.1016/j.ress.2012.12.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data cleansing may be performed [[interactively]] with [[data wrangling]] tools, or as [[batch processing]] through [[script (computing)|script]]ing.

After cleansing, a [[data set]] should be consistent with other similar data sets in the system. The inconsistencies detected or removed may have been originally caused by user entry errors, by corruption in transmission or storage, or by different [[data dictionary]] definitions of similar entities in different stores. Data cleaning differs from [[data validation]] in that validation almost invariably means data is rejected from the system at entry and is performed at the time of entry, rather than on batches of data.
;
The actual process of data cleansing may involve removing [[typographical error]]s or validating and correcting values against a known list of entities. The validation may be strict (such as rejecting any address that does not have a valid [[postal code]]) or [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy]] (such as correcting records that partially match existing, known records). Some data cleansing solutions will clean data by cross checking with a validated data set. A common data cleansing practice is data enhancement, where data is made more complete by adding related information. For example, appending addresses with any phone numbers related to that address. Data cleansing may also involve activities like, harmonization of data, and standardization of data. For example, harmonization of short codes (st, rd, etc.) to actual words (street, road, etcetera). Standardization of data is a means of changing a reference data set to a new standard, ex, use of standard codes.

== Motivation ==
Administratively, incorrect or inconsistent data can lead to false conclusions and misdirected [[investment]]s on both public and private scales. For instance, the [[government]] may want to analyze population census figures to decide which regions require further spending and investment on [[infrastructure]] and services. In this case, it will be important to have access to reliable data to avoid erroneous fiscal decisions. In the business world, incorrect data can be costly. Many companies use customer information [[database]]s that record data like contact information, addresses, and preferences. For instance, if the addresses are inconsistent, the company will suffer the cost of resending mail or even losing customers. The profession of forensic accounting and fraud investigating uses data cleansing in preparing its data and is typically done before data is sent to a data warehouse for further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Nigrini, M. Forensic Analytics: Methods and Techniques for Forensic Accounting Investigations, Wiley. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There are packages available so you can cleanse/wash address data while you enter it into your system. This is normally done via an [[application programming interface]] (API).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171204114529/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/importance-data-cleansing-user-generated-content The importance of data cleansing user-generated-content] Published by spotlessdata.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data quality ==
High-quality data needs to pass a set of quality criteria. Those include:

* '''Validity''': The degree to which the measures conform to defined business rules or constraints (see also [[Validity (statistics)]]). When modern database technology is used to design data-capture systems, validity is fairly easy to ensure: invalid data arises mainly in legacy contexts (where constraints were not implemented in software) or where inappropriate data-capture technology was used (e.g., spreadsheets, where it is very hard to limit what a user chooses to enter into a cell, if cell validation is not used). Data constraints fall into the following categories:
** ''Data-Type Constraints'' – e.g., values in a particular column must be of a particular datatype, e.g., Boolean, numeric (integer or real), date, etc.
** ''Range Constraints:'' typically, numbers or dates should fall within a certain range. That is, they have minimum and/or maximum permissible values.
** ''Mandatory Constraints:'' Certain columns cannot be empty.
** ''Unique Constraints:'' A field, or a combination of fields, must be unique across a dataset. For example, no two persons can have the same social security number.
** ''Set-Membership constraints'': The values for a column come from a set of discrete values or codes. For example, a person's gender may be Female, Male or Unknown (not recorded).
** ''Foreign-key constraints'': This is the more general case of set membership. The set of values in a column is defined in a column of another table that contains unique values. For example, in a US taxpayer database, the "state" column is required to belong to one of the US's defined states or territories: the set of permissible states/territories is recorded in a separate States table. The term [[foreign key]] is borrowed from relational database terminology.
** Regular expression patterns: Occasionally, text fields will have to be validated this way. For example, phone numbers may be required to have the pattern (999) 999-9999.
** Cross-field validation: Certain conditions that utilize multiple fields must hold. For example, in laboratory medicine, the sum of the components of the differential white blood cell count must be equal to 100 (since they are all percentages). In a hospital database, a patient's date of discharge from hospital cannot be earlier than the date of admission.
* '''Accuracy''': The degree of conformity of a measure to a standard or a true value - see also [[Accuracy and precision]]. Accuracy is very hard to achieve through data-cleansing in the general case, because it requires accessing an external source of data that contains the true value: such "gold standard" data is often unavailable. Accuracy has been achieved in some cleansing contexts, notably customer contact data, by using external databases that match up zip codes to geographical locations (city and state), and also help verify that street addresses within these zip codes actually exist.
* '''Completeness''': The degree to which all required measures are known. Incompleteness is almost impossible to fix with data cleansing methodology: one cannot infer facts that were not captured when the data in question was initially recorded. (In some contexts, e.g., interview data, it may be possible to fix incompleteness by going back to the original source of data, i,e., re-interviewing the subject, but even this does not guarantee success because of problems of recall - e.g., in an interview to gather data on food consumption, no one is likely to remember exactly what one ate six months ago. In the case of systems that insist certain columns should not be empty, one may work around the problem by designating a value that indicates "unknown" or "missing", but supplying of default values does not imply that the data has been made complete.
* '''Consistency''': The degree to which a set of measures are equivalent in across systems (see also [[Consistency]]). Inconsistency occurs when two data items in the data set contradict each other: e.g., a customer is recorded in two different systems as having two different current addresses, and only one of them can be correct. Fixing inconsistency is not always possible: it requires a variety of strategies - e.g., deciding which data were recorded more recently, which data source is likely to be most reliable (the latter knowledge may be specific to a given organization), or simply trying to find the truth by testing both data items (e.g., calling up the customer).
* '''Uniformity''': The degree to which a set data measures are specified using the same units of measure in all systems ( see also [[Units of measurement|Unit of measure]]). In datasets pooled from different locales, weight may be recorded either in pounds or kilos, and must be converted to a single measure using an arithmetic transformation.

The term '''integrity''' encompasses accuracy, consistency and some aspects of validation (see also [[data integrity]]) but is rarely used by itself in data-cleansing contexts because it is insufficiently specific. (For example, "[[referential integrity]]" is a term used to refer to the enforcement of foreign-key constraints above.)

== Process ==
* '''Data auditing''': The data is audited with the use of [[statistical]] and database methods to detect anomalies and contradictions: this eventually gives an indication of the characteristics of the anomalies and their locations. Several commercial software packages will let you specify constraints of various kinds (using a grammar that conforms to that of a standard programming language, e.g., JavaScript or Visual Basic) and then generate code that checks the data for violation of these constraints. This process is referred to below in the bullets "workflow specification" and "workflow execution." For users who lack access to high-end cleansing software, Microcomputer database packages such as Microsoft Access or File Maker Pro will also let you perform such checks, on a constraint-by-constraint basis, interactively with little or no programming required in many cases.
* '''Workflow specification''': The detection and removal of anomalies is performed by a sequence of operations on the data known as the workflow. It is specified after the process of auditing the data and is crucial in achieving the end product of high-quality data. In order to achieve a proper workflow, the causes of the anomalies and errors in the data have to be closely considered.
* '''Workflow execution''': In this stage, the workflow is executed after its specification is complete and its correctness is verified. The implementation of the workflow should be efficient, even on large sets of data, which inevitably poses a trade-off because the execution of a data-cleansing operation can be computationally expensive.
* '''Post-processing and controlling''': After executing the cleansing workflow, the results are inspected to verify correctness. Data that could not be corrected during execution of the workflow is manually corrected, if possible. The result is a new cycle in the data-cleansing process where the data is audited again to allow the specification of an additional workflow to further cleanse the data by automatic processing.

Good quality source data has to do with “Data Quality Culture” and must be initiated at the top of the organization. It is not just a matter of implementing strong validation checks on input screens, because almost no matter how strong these checks are, they can often still be circumvented by the users. There is a nine-step guide for organizations that wish to improve data quality:&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, R., Ross, M., Thornthwaite, W., Mundy, J., Becker, B. ''The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit'', Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-470-14977-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, J. E. ''Data Quality: The Accuracy Dimension", [[Morgan Kaufmann]], 2002. {{ISBN|1-55860-891-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Declare a high level commitment to a [[data quality]] culture
* Drive process reengineering at the executive level
* Spend money to improve the data entry environment
* Spend money to improve application integration
* Spend money to change how processes work
* Promote end-to-end team awareness
* Promote interdepartmental cooperation
* Publicly celebrate data quality excellence
* Continuously measure and improve data quality

Others include:
* '''Parsing''':  for the detection of syntax errors. A parser decides whether a string of data is acceptable within the allowed data specification. This is similar to the way a parser works with [[grammars]] and [[languages]].
* '''Data transformation''': Data transformation allows the mapping of the data from its given format into the format expected by the appropriate application. This includes value conversions or translation functions, as well as normalizing numeric values to conform to minimum and maximum values.
* '''Duplicate elimination''': Duplicate detection requires an [[algorithm]] for determining whether data contains duplicate representations of the same entity. Usually, data is sorted by a key that would bring duplicate entries closer together for faster identification.
* '''Statistical methods''': By analyzing the data using the values of [[mean]], [[standard deviation]], [[range (statistics)|range]], or [[cluster analysis|clustering]] algorithms, it is possible for an expert to find values that are unexpected and thus erroneous. Although the correction of such data is difficult since the true value is not known, it can be resolved by setting the values to an average or other statistical value. Statistical methods can also be used to handle missing values which can be replaced by one or more plausible values, which are usually obtained by extensive data augmentation algorithms.

==System==
The essential job of this system is to find a suitable balance between fixing [[dirty data]] and maintaining the data as close as possible to the original data from the source production system. This is a challenge for the [[Extract, transform, load]] architect. The system should offer an architecture that can cleanse data, record quality events and measure/control quality of data in the [[data warehouse]]. A good start is to perform a thorough [[data profiling]] analysis that will help define to the required complexity of the data cleansing system and also give an idea of the current data quality in the source system(s).

== Tools ==
There are lots of data cleansing tools like [[Trifacta]], [[OpenRefine]], [[Paxata]], [[Alteryx]], and others. It's also common to use libraries like [[Pandas (software)]] for [[Python (programming language)]], or [http://dplyr.tidyverse.org Dplyr] for [[R (programming language)]]. 

One example of a data cleansing for distributed systems under [[Apache Spark]] is called [https://hioptimus.com Optimus], an [[Open-source model|OpenSource]] framework for laptop or cluster allowing pre-processing, cleansing, and exploratory data analysis.  It includes several data wrangling tools.

==Quality screens==
Part of the data cleansing system is a set of diagnostic filters known as quality screens. They each implement a test in the data flow that, if it fails records an error in the Error Event Schema. Quality screens are divided into three categories:
* Column screens. Testing the individual column, e.g. for unexpected values like [[Null character|NULL]] values; non-numeric values that should be numeric; out of range values; etc.
* Structure screens. These are used to test for the integrity of different relationships between columns (typically foreign/primary keys) in the same or different tables. They are also used for testing that a group of columns is valid according to some structural definition to which it should adhere.
* Business rule screens. The most complex of the three tests. They test to see if data, maybe across multiple tables, follow specific business rules. An example could be, that if a customer is marked as a certain type of customer, the business rules that define this kind of customer should be adhered to.

When a quality screen records an error, it can either stop the dataflow process, send the faulty data somewhere else than the target system or tag the data.
The latter option is considered the best solution because the first option requires, that someone has to manually deal with the issue each time it occurs and the second implies that data are missing from the target system ([[integrity]]) and it is often unclear what should happen to these data.

==Criticism of existing tools and processes==
Most data cleansing tools have limitations in usability:
* '''Project costs''': costs typically in the hundreds of thousands of dollars
* '''Time''': mastering large-scale data-cleansing software is time-consuming
* '''Security''': cross-validation requires sharing information, giving an application access across systems, including sensitive legacy systems

==Error event schema==
The Error Event schema holds records of all error events thrown by the quality screens. It consists of an Error Event [[Fact table]] with [[foreign key]]s to three dimension tables that represent date (when), [[batch job]] (where) and screen (who produced error). It also holds information about exactly when the error occurred and the severity of the error. In addition there is an Error Event Detail [[Fact table]] with a [[foreign key]] to the main table that contains detailed information about in which table, record and field the error occurred and the error condition.

== Challenges and problems ==
* '''Error correction and loss of information''': The most challenging problem within data cleansing remains the correction of values to remove [[data redundancy|duplicate]]s and invalid entries. In many cases, the available information on such anomalies is limited and insufficient to determine the necessary transformations or corrections, leaving the deletion of such entries as a primary solution. The deletion of data, though, leads to [[Data loss|loss of information]]; this loss can be particularly costly if there is a large amount of deleted data.
* '''Maintenance of cleansed data''': Data cleansing is an expensive and time-consuming process. So after having performed data cleansing and achieving a data collection free of errors, one would want to avoid the re-cleansing of data in its entirety after some values in data collection change. The process should only be repeated on values that have changed; this means that a cleansing lineage would need to be kept, which would require efficient data collection and management techniques.
* '''Data cleansing in virtually integrated environments''': In virtually integrated sources like [[IBM]]’s DiscoveryLink, the cleansing of data has to be performed every time the data is accessed, which considerably increases the response time and lowers efficiency.
* '''Data-cleansing framework''': In many cases, it will not be possible to derive a complete data-cleansing graph to guide the process in advance. This makes data cleansing an [[iterative]] process involving significant exploration and interaction, which may require a framework in the form of a collection of methods for error detection and elimination in addition to data auditing. This can be integrated with other data-processing stages like integration and maintenance.

[[Image:Electromagnetic shielding inside mobile phone.jpg|thumb|Electromagnetic shielding cages inside a disassembled [[mobile phone]].]]{{About|shielding materials|atomic effect|Shielding effect}}  

'''Electromagnetic shielding''' is the practice of reducing the [[electromagnetic field]] in a space by blocking the field with barriers made of [[electrical conductor|conductive]] or magnetic materials. Shielding is typically applied to enclosures to isolate electrical devices from their surroundings, and to cables to isolate wires from the environment through which the cable runs. Electromagnetic shielding that blocks [[radio frequency]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] is also known as '''RF shielding'''.

The shielding can reduce the [[Coupling (electronics)|coupling]] of [[Radio frequency|radio waves]], electromagnetic fields and [[electrostatic field]]s. A conductive enclosure used to block electrostatic fields is also known as a [[Faraday cage]]. The amount of reduction depends very much upon the material used, its thickness, the size of the shielded volume and the frequency of the fields of interest and the size, shape and orientation of apertures in a shield to an incident electromagnetic field.

==Materials used==
Typical materials used for electromagnetic shielding include [[sheet metal]], metal screen, and [[metal foam]]. Any holes in the shield or mesh must be significantly smaller than the [[wavelength]] of the radiation that is being kept out, or the enclosure will not effectively approximate an unbroken conducting surface.

Another commonly used shielding method, especially with electronic goods housed in plastic enclosures, is to coat the inside of the enclosure with a metallic ink or similar material.  The ink consists of a carrier material loaded with a suitable metal, typically [[copper]] or [[nickel]], in the form of very small particulates.  It is sprayed on to the enclosure and, once dry, produces a continuous conductive layer of metal, which can be electrically connected to the [[chassis ground]] of the equipment, thus providing effective shielding.

Electromagnetic shielding is the process of lowering the electromagnetic field in an area by barricading it with conductive or magnetic material. [[Copper in architecture#Radio frequency shielding|Copper is used for radio frequency (RF) shielding]] because it absorbs [[radio wave|radio]] and [[electromagnetic wave]]s. Properly designed and constructed [[Copper in architecture#Radio frequency shielding|copper RF shielding]] enclosures satisfy most RF shielding needs, from computer and electrical switching rooms to hospital [[CAT-scan]] and [[MRI]] facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Seale, Wayne (2007). The role of copper, brass, and bronze in architecture and design; ‘‘Metal Architecture,’’ May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radio frequency shielding, Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, Copper Development Association Inc., http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/fundamentals/radio_shielding.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example applications==
[[Image:Coaxial cable cutaway.svg|thumb|right|Cross-section through a coaxial cable showing shielding and other layers]]
One example is a [[shielded cable]], which has electromagnetic shielding in the form of a wire mesh surrounding an inner core conductor.  The shielding impedes the escape of any signal from the core conductor, and also prevents signals from being added to the core conductor.
Some cables have two separate [[coaxial]] screens, one connected at both ends, the other at one end only, to maximize shielding of both electromagnetic and electrostatic fields.

The door of a [[microwave oven]] has a screen built into the window. From the perspective of microwaves (with wavelengths of 12&amp;nbsp;cm) this screen finishes a [[Faraday cage]] formed by the oven's metal housing.  Visible light, with wavelengths ranging between 400&amp;nbsp;nm and 700&amp;nbsp;nm, passes easily through the screen holes.

RF shielding is also used to prevent access to data stored on [[RFID]] chips embedded in various devices, such as [[biometric passports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8227-metal-shields-and-encryption-for-us-passports.html |title=Metal shields and encryption for US passports |publisher=Newscientist.com |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NATO]] specifies electromagnetic shielding for computers and keyboards to prevent passive monitoring of keyboard emissions that would allow passwords to be captured; consumer keyboards do not offer this protection primarily because of the prohibitive cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://lasecwww.epfl.ch/keyboard/|title=Compromising Electromagnetic Emanations of Wired and Wireless Keyboards|date=2009-06-01|author=Martin Vuagnoux and Sylvain Pasini|publisher=Security and Cryptography Laboratory (LASEC)|location=[[Lausanne]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RF shielding is also used to protect medical and laboratory equipment to provide protection against interfering signals, including AM, FM, TV, emergency services, dispatch, pagers, ESMR, cellular, and PCS.  It can also be used to protect the equipment at the AM, FM or TV broadcast facilities.

== How it works ==
Electromagnetic radiation consists of coupled [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields.  The electric field produces [[force]]s on the [[electric charge|charge]] carriers (i.e., [[electron]]s) within the conductor.  As soon as an electric field is applied to the surface of an ideal conductor, it induces a [[current (electricity)|current]] that causes displacement of charge inside the conductor that cancels the applied field inside, at which point the current stops.

Similarly, ''varying'' [[magnetic field]]s generate [[eddy current]]s that act to cancel the applied magnetic field.  (The conductor does not respond to static magnetic fields unless the conductor is moving relative to the magnetic field.)  The result is that [[electromagnetic radiation]] is reflected from the surface of the conductor: internal fields stay inside, and external fields stay outside.

Several factors serve to limit the shielding capability of real RF shields. One is that, due to the [[electrical resistance]] of the conductor, the excited field does not completely cancel the incident field.  Also, most conductors exhibit a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] response to low-frequency magnetic fields, so that such fields are not fully attenuated by the conductor.  Any holes in the shield force current to flow around them, so that fields passing through the holes do not excite opposing electromagnetic fields.  These effects reduce the field-reflecting capability of the shield.

In the case of high-[[frequency]] electromagnetic radiation, the above-mentioned adjustments take a non-negligible amount of time, yet any such radiation energy, as far as it is not reflected, is absorbed by the skin (unless it is extremely thin), so in this case there is no electromagnetic field inside either. This is one aspect of a greater phenomenon called the [[skin effect]]. A measure of the depth to which radiation can penetrate the shield is the so-called [[skin depth]].

== Magnetic shielding ==
Equipment sometimes requires isolation from external magnetic fields.  For static or slowly varying magnetic fields (below about 100&amp;nbsp;kHz) the Faraday shielding described above is ineffective.  In these cases shields made of high [[magnetic permeability]] metal [[alloy]]s can be used, such as sheets of [[permalloy]] and [[mu-metal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magnetic-shield.com/literature/pdf/mu-2.pdf |title=MuMETAL |id=Catalog MU-2 |publisher=Magnetic Shield Corp. |date=2012 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=73410422&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch|title=Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval|website=tsdr.uspto.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; or with nanocrystalline grain structure ferromagnetic metal coatings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/item/emcdirectory-design_2009/index.php#/134 |title=Interference Technology Magazine Whitepaper on Ferromagnetic Nanocrystalline Metal Magnetic Shield Coatings |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315010701/http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/item/emcdirectory-design_2009/index.php#/134 |archivedate=March 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These materials don't block the magnetic field, as with electric shielding, but rather draw the field into themselves, providing a path for the [[magnetic field lines]] around the shielded volume.  The best shape for magnetic shields is thus a closed container surrounding the shielded volume.  The effectiveness of this type of shielding depends on the material's permeability, which generally drops off at both very low magnetic field strengths and at high field strengths where the material becomes [[magnetic saturation|saturated]].  So to achieve low residual fields, magnetic shields often consist of several enclosures one inside the other, each of which successively reduces the field inside it.

Because of the above limitations of passive shielding, an alternative used with static or low-frequency fields is active shielding; using a field created by [[electromagnet]]s to cancel the ambient field within a volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acornnmr.com/appnotes/shielding.htm |title=NMR Magnet Shielding: The seat of the pants guide to understanding the problems of shielding NMR magnets |publisher=Acorn NMR |date=22 January 2003 |accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Solenoid]]s and [[Helmholtz coil]]s are types of coils that can be used for this purpose.

Additionally, [[superconductivity|superconducting]] materials can expel magnetic fields via the [[Meissner effect]].

==Mathematical model==

Suppose that we have a spherical shell of a (linear and isotropic) diamagnetic material with permeability &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, with inner radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and outer radius &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. We then put this object in a constant magnetic field:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{H}_{0}=H_{0}\hat{z}=H_{0}\cos\theta \hat{r} - H_{0}\sin\theta \hat{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;
Since there are no currents in this problem except for possible bound currents on the boundaries of the diamagnetic material, then we can define a magnetic scalar potential that satisfies Laplace's equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{H}=-\nabla \Phi_{M}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^{2}\Phi_{M}=0&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{B}=\mu \vec{H} &lt;/math&gt;
In this particular problem there is azimuthal symmetry so we can write down that the solution to Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates is:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{M}=\sum_{l=0}^\infty \left( A_{l}r^{l}+\frac{B_{l}}{r^{l+1}}\right)P_{l}(\cos\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
After matching the boundary conditions
:&lt;math&gt;(\vec{H}_{2}-\vec{H}_{1})\times \hat{n}=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\vec{B}_{2}-\vec{B}_{1})\cdot \hat{n}=0&lt;/math&gt;
at the boundaries (where &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector that is normal to the surface pointing from side 1 to side 2), then we find that the magnetic field inside the cavity in the spherical shell is:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{H}_{in}=\eta \vec{H}_{0}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is an attenuation coefficient that depends on the thickness of the diamagnetic material and the magnetic permeability of the material:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{9\mu}{(2\mu+1)(\mu+2)-2\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{3}(\mu-1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
This coefficient describes the effectiveness of this material in shielding the external magnetic field from the cavity that it surrounds. Notice that this coefficient appropriately goes to 1 (no shielding) in the limit that &lt;math&gt;\mu \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;. In the limit that &lt;math&gt;\mu \rightarrow 0, \infty &lt;/math&gt; this coefficient goes to 0 (perfect shielding), then the attenuation coefficient takes on the simpler form:
:&lt;math&gt; \eta=\frac{9}{2} \frac{1}{(1-\frac{a^{3}}{b^{3}}) \mu} &lt;/math&gt; 
which shows that the magnetic field decreases like &lt;math&gt; \mu^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John David |last=Jackson |title=Classical Electrodynamics |edition=third |at=Section 5.12 |date=10 August 1998 |isbn=978-0471309321 &lt;!-- hardcover --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NOTE: In the above relations, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is relative permeability ''µ''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the ratio of the permeability of a specific medium to the permeability of free space ''µ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_r = \frac{\mu}{\mu_0},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''µ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 4''π''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;N&amp;nbsp;A&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Fairmat''' is a free-of-charge multi-platform software that allows to model financial contracts (e.g. a [[derivative contract]]) or projects with many contingencies (e.g. a [[Real options analysis|Real Options]] model) by decomposing it into basic parts. Complex structures and dependencies are modelled using a graphical interface. Virtually any pay-off function and asset class( from [[interest rate derivative]]s to [[equity-linked note]]s) can be described using a simple algebraic language.

Fairmat is available for [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]][https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/fairmat-academic/].

== Features ==
* Fairmat provides a high level abstraction and allows users to price and perform analysis for new derivative contracts or project by modelling it with a bottom-up procedure, with no knowledge of programming languages. The generated models can then be solved by using [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|Monte Carlo simulation]], [[Binomial options pricing model|binomial trees]] or closed form procedures (e.g. the [[black model]]).
* The information about the structure of every project model is contained in an xml file and can be exchanged with third parties.
* Fairmat capabilities can be extended and specialized by plug-ins using the [http://www.mono-project.com/Mono.Addins Mono.addins] extensibility model. Available plug-ins can be found on [http://www.fairmat.com/plugins], and while few of the plug-ins are [[closed source software]], many of them are [[Open-source software|open source]] and their development can be followed on the Fairmat [https://github.com/fairmat github page].

'''Game Boy Advance Video''' is a format for putting full color, full-motion videos onto [[Game Boy Advance]] [[ROM cartridge]]s. These videos are playable using the Game Boy Advance system's [[Display device|screen]] and sound hardware. These video cartridges were manufactured by [[Majesco Entertainment]], except for the ''Pokémon'' Game Boy Advance Video cartridges, which were published by [[Nintendo]]. The cartridges themselves were developed by [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment's]] subsidiary 4Kids Technology, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/docs/news/2003-0513.pdf|title=Cartoons Come To Nintendo’s Game Boy Advance As 4Kids Entertainment Lauches GBA-TV|publisher=4kidsentertainment.com|date=May 13, 2003|accessdate=August 24, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614222659/http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/docs/news/2003-0513.pdf|archivedate=June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video cartridges are colored white for easy identification and are sold as ''Game Boy Advance Video Paks''. The Game Boy Advance Video game paks offer the same 240×160 [[display resolution|resolution]] as standard Game Boy Advance games.&lt;ref name="nintendowr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/newsArt.cfm?artid=9528|title=Hip Interactive Brings GBA Video to Canada|first=Michael|last=Cole|publisher=Nintendo World Report|date=2004-04-28|accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{toclimit|limit=2}}

==History==
Game Boy Advance Video Paks first became available in [[North America]] in May 2004. In June 2004, Majesco had expanded its Game Boy Advance Video licenses into other categories. In November 2004, Majesco started to sell GBA Video Paks featuring several [[Disney Channel]] animated series, including ''[[Brandy &amp; Mr. Whiskers]]'', ''[[Kim Possible]]'', ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series]]'', and ''[[The Proud Family]]''. In November 2005, Majesco began to sell GBA Video Paks featuring full-length animated movies like ''[[Shrek 2]]'' and ''[[Shark Tale]]''. A special GBA Video Pak containing the movies ''[[Shrek]]'' and ''Shark Tale'' combined into one cartridge was released later, costing approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]29.99 MSRP as of April 2007. As of April 2007, the retail price of original GBA Video Paks was lowered to US$9.95.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Copy protection==
Game Boy Advance Video Paks are viewable only on [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Game Boy Advance SP]], [[Game Boy Micro]], [[Nintendo DS]], and [[Nintendo DS Lite]] systems, as the owners of copyright in the television shows requested that Majesco prevent people from using the [[GameCube]]'s [[Game Boy Player]] accessory to play and record the shows onto [[VHS]] tapes or [[DVD]]s. However, the low resolution and mono sound would result in a low-quality video output on a TV regardless. Unlike [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox]] video game consoles, the Nintendo GameCube cannot output [[Macrovision]] gain-control copy distortion signals.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The GBA Video Paks perform a check when inserted into the Game Boy Player, using the same logo authentication method used by Game Boy Advance games that support controller rumble, and will freeze with the message "Not designed for Game Boy Player" if they detect the Game Boy Player in use.

==Disadvantages==
Because of the low capacity of Game Boy Advance cartridges (ranging from 4 to 32 [[Megabyte|MB]]) and the length of the video content (generally feature-length movies and episodes), GBA Video Paks are heavily compressed, with visual artifacts marring nearly every frame. The image quality has a similar appearance to early [[Cinepak]] compression, and the "quilting" and color bleeding effect found in other compressed video formats is also present. Also, in cases where certain videos are available both as a 45-minute two-part episodes or a 22-minute edited version, the 22-minute version is used.

==Additional information==
Game Boy Advance Video Paks were the feature prize in Vol. 183 of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' Magazine, as part of its players poll sweepstakes, in which five grand prize winners would receive a Game Boy Advance SP and twenty GBA Video Paks. Most GBA Video Paks cost US$9.95 and feature 40 to 45 minutes of video content. GBA Video Movie Paks cost US$19.99 and feature up to a 90-minute movie.

Some GBA Video Movie Paks came packaged with headphones.

'''Georg Sigl''' (13 January 1811, [[Breitenfurt bei Wien]] - 9 May 1887, [[Vienna]]) was an Austrian [[mechanical engineer]] and entrepreneur.

== Life ==
Sigl studied to be a [[locksmith]], but later moved to Berlin where, in 1844, he established a small factory for the construction of printing presses. In 1846, he founded a second factory in Vienna.

In 1851, he moved the company to [[Währinger Straße]] (then on the outskirts of the city), where he manufactured [[steam locomotive]]s. In the early 1870s, he produced the first compaction-free, [[Two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] locomotive engines, designed by automotive pioneer [[Siegfried Marcus]]. In 1861, he leased the [[Wiener Neustädter Lokomotivfabrik]] from the [[Creditanstalt]] and, by 1867, was its owner. It became the largest factory of its kind in the Empire and, by 1870, had produced its 1000th locomotive.

In addition to the locomotive trade, his factories also produced [[oil press]]es, marine engines, architectural support structures and equipment for amusement park rides. In 1872, he introduced the "Straßenlokomotive" (road locomotive), that looked like a steam roller and was put to use as a [[tow truck]].

During the [[Panic of 1873]], Sigl lost all of his holdings except his original Vienna factory. The Wiener Neustädter Lokomotivfabrik became a [[Government-owned corporation|public company]].

== Honors ==

* On 11 February 1870, he became an [[List of Honorary Citizens of Vienna|Honorary Citizen of Vienna]]. 
* In 1888, a street in [[Alsergrund]] was renamed the ''Georg-Sigl-Gasse''.
* In 2011, the [[Österreichische Post]] issued a [[commemorative stamp]] for his 200th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahn-austria.at/k_diesdas_00_marken.htm Personalisierte Briefmarken] auf Bahn-Austria; retrieved, 28 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hai Karate''' was a budget [[aftershave]] sold in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] from the 1960s through to the 1980s. It was reintroduced in the [[United Kingdom]] under official licence in late 2014 by Healthpoint Ltd.

==History==
The [[fragrance]] was originally developed by the Leeming division of [[Pfizer]] and launched in 1967. As well as the original Hai Karate fragrance, versions named Oriental Lime and Oriental Spice were soon introduced. It competed successfully with such other brands as [[Aqua Velva]], [[Old Spice]], Jaguar, English Leather, British Sterling, Dante, and [[Brut (cologne)|Brut]] before fading away in the 1980s.

==Present==
Brought back in 2014, Hai Karate has been re-produced according to the original formulation, although in a different bottle and re-worked packaging. Available for sale in the UK and online.

==Marketing==
Hai Karate is best remembered today for its [[television advertisement|television adverts]] and its [[marketing]] plan, with a small self-defence instruction booklet sold with each bottle to help wearers fend off women. In the UK spots, a stereotypical [[nerd]] covers himself in Hai Karate and is promptly seduced by a female passer-by played by British starlet [[Valerie Leon]]; similar ads ran in the US as well. All of the spots contained the [[catch phrase]] "Be careful how you use it".

[[Image:HomodyneDetection2.png|thumb|200px|Optical homodyne detection.]]
'''Homodyne detection''' is a method of extracting information encoded as [[modulation]] of the [[Phase modulation|phase]] and/or [[frequency modulation|frequency]] of an oscillating signal, by comparing that signal with a standard oscillation that would be identical to the signal if it carried null information.  "Homodyne" signifies a single frequency, in contrast to the dual frequencies employed in [[heterodyne detection]].

When applied to processing of the reflected signal in [[remote sensing]] for [[topography]], homodyne detection lacks the ability of heterodyne detection to determine the size of a static discontinuity in elevation between two locations.  (If there is a path between the two locations with smoothly changing elevation, then homodyne detection may in principle be able to track the signal phase along the path if sampling is dense enough.) Homodyne detection is more readily applicable to [[velocity]] sensing.

==In optics==
In optical [[interferometry]], '''homodyne''' signifies that ''the reference radiation'' (i.e. the [[local oscillator]]) ''is derived from the same source as the signal before the modulating process''. For example, in a [[laser]] scattering measurement, the laser beam is split into two parts. One is the local oscillator and the other is sent to the system to be probed. The scattered light is then mixed with the local oscillator on the detector. This arrangement has the advantage of being insensitive to fluctuations in the frequency of the laser. Usually the scattered beam will be weak, in which case the (nearly) steady component of the detector output is a good measure of the instantaneous local oscillator intensity and therefore can be used to compensate for any fluctuations in the intensity of the laser.&lt;ref name=Renishaw&gt;{{cite web| url=http://resources.renishaw.com/en/download/white-paper-homodyne-and-heterodyne-interferometry--5653 |title=Heterodyne and homodyne interferometry |last=Chapman |first=Mark |publisher=Renishaw plc (UK) | date=2002 |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Xu&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Xu|first1=Qing|title=Optical Homodyne Detections and Applications in Quantum Cryptography|date=2009|publisher=[[Télécom ParisTech]]|location=Paris|url=https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00005580/file/ThesisFull_V2.pdf|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=Too brief for nonexperts.|date=October 2016}}

==Radio technology==
In [[radio]] technology, the distinction is not the source of the local oscillator, but the frequency used. In heterodyne detection, the local oscillator is frequency-shifted, while in homodyne detection it has the same frequency as the radiation to be detected. See [[direct conversion receiver]].

==Applications==
[[Lock-in amplifier]]s are homodyne detectors integrated into measurement equipment or packaged as stand-alone laboratory equipment for sensitive detection and highly selective filtering of weak or noisy signals. Homodyne/lock-in detection has been one of the most commonly used signal processing methods across a wide range of experimental disciplines for decades.

Homodyne and heterodyne techniques are commonly used in [[Time-domain thermoreflectance|thermoreflectance]] techniques.

In the processing of signals in some applications of [[magnetic resonance imaging]], homodyne detection can offer advantages over magnitude detection. The homodyne technique can suppress excessive noise and undesired quadrature components (90° out-of-phase), and provide stable access to information that may be encoded into the [[Phase (waves)|phase or polarity]] of images.&lt;ref name="NollNishimura1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noll|first1=D.C.|last2=Nishimura|first2=D.G.|last3=Macovski|first3=A.|title=Homodyne detection in magnetic resonance imaging|journal=IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging|volume=10|issue=2|year=1991|pages=154–163|issn=0278-0062|doi=10.1109/42.79473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Encryption|encrypted]] [[secure communication]] system can be based on [[quantum key distribution]] (QKD). An efficient receiver scheme for implementing QKD is balanced homodyne detection (BHD) using a positive-intrinsic-negative ([[PIN diode|PIN]]) diode.&lt;ref name=Xu/&gt;

Homodyne detection was one of the key techniques in demonstrating [[Quantum Entanglement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|work=Nature Communications|title=Experimental proof of nonlocal wavefunction collapse for a single particle using homodyne measurements|author1=Maria Fuwa |author2=Shuntaro Takeda |author3=Marcin Zwierz |author4=Howard M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1210">The '''Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration''', signed in 2002, was the result of the first [[Japan]]-[[North Korea]] [[summit meeting]]. It was an attempt to resolve the uneasy diplomatic relationship  that existed between the two nations, provided for economic assistance to North Korea (including [[humanitarian aid]]), low-interest long-term loans, and discussed the future of nuclear missile development.

North Korea agreed to extend its moratorium on missile tests, in place since 1999. However, this may have been breached. (See [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction]]).

'''Jongla''' is a Finnish start-up company, specialising [[Instant messaging|mobile messaging]] apps. In June 2016, Jongla announced that it wants to bridge the gap between [[social networking service]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and messaging apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arcticstartup.com/article/jongla-social-messenger/|title=Arctic Startup - Jongla Social Messenger|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jongla is targeting especially [[emerging markets]] like [[Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South America]], where they are seeing the best traction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pulse.ng/tech/jongla-instant-messaging-app-announces-entry-into-african-market-id4939155.html|title=Pulse.ng|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goodnewsfinland.com/feature/jongla-merger-social-networks-instant-messaging/|title=Good News From Finland|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisoncoleman/2016/01/17/disrupting-the-instant-messaging-app-space-jongla-style/#7ca72e1d63ef|title=Disrupting The Instant Messaging App Space, Jongla-style|last=Coleman|first=Alison|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jongla app is available on [[Android (operating system)|Android]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.apache.android.xmpp|title=Google Play|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[iOS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/app/jongla-sosiaalinen-pikaviestisovellus/id564199158?l=fi&amp;mt=8|title=App Store|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows Phone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/jongla/9wzdncrfhwr7|title=Windows Phone Store|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computing platform|platforms]].

== Messaging app ==
In June, 2016 Jongla introduced their 3rd generation app, the Jongla - Social Messenger, which introduced feature updates, brand upgrade and a new app UI. In Social Messenger, Jongla introduced the community of nearby Jongla users and an added ability to engage with user profiles with a choice of reaction like thumbs-up, smile or heart.

Jongla claims to be the world’s lightest [[instant messaging]] [[Mobile app|app]]. The company backs up their claim with app package size comparisons. In June 2016, their [[Android application package|APK]] (Android Application Package) size was 3.5MB, being one tenth of that compared to their competitor apps like Whatsapp, Messenger and Viber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160622005803/en/Jongla-Social-Messenger-bridges-gap-instant-messaging|title=Business Wire|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jongla has the basic messaging functions like private and group chats and sharing text, stickers, images, locations and videos.

The '''Louis XIII style''' or '''''Louis Treize''''' was a fashion in [[France|French]] [[art]] and [[architecture]], especially affecting the [[visual arts|visual]] and [[decorative arts]]. Its distinctness as a period in the history of French art has much to do with the [[Regent|regency]] under which [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] began his reign (1610&amp;ndash;1643). His mother and regent, [[Marie de' Medici]], imported [[mannerism]] from her homeland of [[Italy]] and the influence of Italian art was to be strongly felt for several decades. 

Louis XIII-style painting was influenced from the north, through [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Baroque]], and from the south, through Italian mannerism and early Baroque. Schools developed around [[Caravaggio]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. Among the French painters who blended Italian mannerism with a love of [[genre scenes]] were [[Georges de La Tour]], [[Simon Vouet]], and the [[Le Nain|Le Nain brothers]]. The influence of the painters on subsequent generations, however, was minimised by the rise of [[French Baroque and Classicism|classicism]] under [[Nicolas Poussin]] and his followers. 

Louis XIII architecture was equally influenced by Italian styles. The greatest French architect of the era, [[Salomon de Brosse]], designed the [[Palais du Luxembourg]] for Marie de' Medici. De Brosse began a tradition of classicism in architecture that was continued by [[Jacques Lemercier]], who completed the Palais and whose own most famous work of the Louis XIII period is the chapel of the [[Sorbonne]] (1635). Under the next generation of architects, French Baroque would take an even greater classical shift. 

Furniture of the period was typically large and austere.

[[File:Amphenol 16pin male front.jpg|200px|right|thumb|MIL-DTL-5015 16-pin circular connector manufactured by Amphenol]]

'''MIL-DTL-5015''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-SPECS/MIL-SPECS-MIL-DTL/MIL-DTL-5015H_18627/ |title=''MIL-DTL-5015H, Connectors, Electrical, Circular Threaded, AN Type, General Specification For'' |publisher=Department of Defense |date=18 May 2000 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[military specification]], covers  electrical [[circular connector]]s with solder or removable [[Crimp (joining)|crimp contacts]] (both front and rear release). These connectors are for use in electronic, electrical power, and control circuits and are used in large numbers for defense, civil, and industrial applications due to their versatility, reliability, and ease of supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qscomp.cz/Pdf/AE100A_2-3.pdf |title=''Data Sheet: Rear Release Circular Connectors'' |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and evolution ==

In the early 1930s, Cannon (now [[ITT Interconnect Solutions]]) was contracted by [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] to develop electrical [[circular connector]]s for use on the [[DC-1]] and on the subsequent [[DC-2]] and [[DC-3]] aircraft platforms. During the late 1930s—with [[World War II]] on the horizon—Cannon began volume production of multi-contact circular connectors that were used by virtually every aircraft builder in the [[United States]]. Cannon's Type "AN" [[Joint Electronics Type Designation System|(Army-Navy)]] series set the standard for modern circular connectors procured under MIL-C-5015—now MIL-DTL-5015—[[military specification]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-SPECS/MIL-SPECS-MIL-C/MIL-C-5015G_22874/ |title=''MIL-C-5015,  Military Specification: Connectors, Electrical, Circular Threaded, AN Type, General Specification For — Superseded By MIL-DTL-5015H''  |date=23 March 1976|accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittcannon.com/uploadedFiles/Product_PDFs/History.pdf |title=''History Brochure: Cannon, VEAM, BIW — A Historical Achievement of Technology Leadership'' |publisher=ITT Interconnect Solutions |date=October 2008 |accessdate=2012-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309015738/http://www.ittcannon.com/uploadedFiles/Product_PDFs/History.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[military specification]] MIL-DTL-5015 was superseded by SAE-AS50151&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standards.sae.org/as50151/ |title=''SAE-AS50151, Connectors, Electrical, Circular Threaded, AN Type, General Specification For'' |publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers |date=24 June 2004 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-SPECS/MIL-SPECS-MIL-DTL/MIL-DTL-5015H_NOTICE-1_22856/ |title=''MIL-DTL-5015H (Notice-1), Connectors, Electrical, Circular Threaded, AN Type, General Specification For'' |publisher=Department of Defense |date=23 December 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  pursuant to the general [[United States Department of Defense]] goal to reduce the number of [[United States Military Standard|military standards]] in favor of industry [[technical standard]]s supported by  [[Standards organization|Standards Developing Organizations]] (SDO) such as the [[ISO 9000]] series for [[quality assurance]] and the [[SAE International|SAE]] for technical specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=32397 |title=''Memorandum, Specifications and Standards — A New Way of Doing Business'' |publisher=Secretary of Defense |date=29 June 1994 |accessdate=2012-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021123641/https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=32397 |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Form factor and selection criteria==
MIL-DTL-5015 [[circular connectors]] are used primarily for their ease of engagement and disengagement, ability to house different types of contacts, a wide range of allowable contact voltages and currents, and their rugged mechanical performance under a variety of environmental conditions. Their primary disadvantage is loss of panel space when used in arrays when compared to rectangular connector housings.

There are 19 shell sizes—from size-8 to size-40—with about 160 approved insert arrangements incorporating 1-to-85 contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittcannon.com/uploadedFiles/Product_PDFs/History.pdf |title=''MIL-STD-1651A — Insert Arrangements For Mil-C-5015, Mil-C-22992 (Classes C, J, and R), and Mil-C-83723 (Series II) Electrical Connector'' |publisher=Department of Defense |date=3 April 1992 |accessdate=2012-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309015738/http://www.ittcannon.com/uploadedFiles/Product_PDFs/History.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[circular connectors]] are available with a choice of wall mount, box mount, cable connecting and jam-nut receptacles, as well as standard or self-locking plugs.

Similar connectors with different contact arrangements and [[Bayonet mount|bayonet]] coupling rings are also available to military specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-SPECS/MIL+SPECS+(MIL-C)/MIL-C-26482G_30155/ |title=MIL-C-26482H — ''Connectors, Electrical, (Circular, Miniature, Quick Disconnect, Environment Resisting), Receptacles And Plugs, General Specification For' |publisher=Department of Defense  |date=20 February 2007 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supplemental [[military specification]]s (e.g., MS Drawings, Detail Specifications, and Performance Specifications) are available to assist users with the proper selection of connectors and related components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-SPECS/MIL+SPECS+(MIL-DTL)/MIL-DTL-5015H_SUPPLEMENT-1_18628/ |title=''MIL-DTL-5015H (Supplement 1), Connectors, Electrical, Circular Threaded, AN Type, General Specification For'' |publisher=Department of Defense|date= 18 May 2000 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/categories/AN-connectors// |title=''Supplemental MIL-DTL-5015 &amp; MIL-C-5015 Documents - An On-Line Collection of the Controlling Military Specifications and related MS Drawings for MIL-DTL-5015 and MIL-C-5015 Connectors'' |publisher= |date=  |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial alternative connectors ==

Commercial Off-The-Shelf [[Commercial off-the-shelf|(COTS)]] derivative circular connectors exist that intermate with the military versions designed to MIL-C-5015/MIL-DTL-5015. Both COTS and military-style connectors are sometimes called "Type AN" connectors, "MS connectors" "Cannon connectors", or "[[Amphenol connector]]s". [[Amphenol Corporation]], Glenair Inc.,  and [[ITT Interconnect Solutions]] (Cannon) are notable manufacturers of this type of connectors. [[Amphenol Corporation]] (Industrial Global Operations) provides a "5015 series". 5015 series connectors are medium to heavy weight cylindrical connectors with 5 shell styles, 19 shell sizes and 5 service classes. The 5015 offers 305 contact arrangements from 1-to-104 circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amphenol-industrial.com/index.php/mil-5015 |title=''MIL 5015 Product Description: Cost effective circular, metal, multi-pin, threaded coupling  signal or power connector for benign or harsh environments.

Debye]] (1926) and [[William Giauque|W. Giauque]] (1927).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zemansky | first = Mark W. | title = Temperatures very low and very high | publisher = Dover | date = 1981 | location = New York | page = 50 | isbn = 978-0-486-24072-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first working magnetic refrigerators were constructed by several groups beginning in 1933.  Magnetic refrigeration was the first method developed for cooling below about 0.3K (a temperature attainable by [[Helium-3|{{chem|3|He}}]] refrigeration, that is pumping on the {{chem|3|He}} vapors).

== The magnetocaloric effect ==

The magnetocaloric effect (MCE, from ''[[magnet]]'' and ''[[calorie]]'') is a magneto-[[thermodynamic]] phenomenon in which a temperature change of a suitable material is caused by exposing the material to a changing magnetic field. This is also known by low temperature physicists as ''[[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] demagnetization''. In that part of the refrigeration process, a decrease in the strength of an externally applied magnetic field allows the magnetic domains of a magnetocaloric material to become disoriented from the magnetic field by the agitating action of the thermal energy ([[phonon]]s) present in the material.  If the material is isolated so that no energy is allowed to (re)migrate into the material during this time, (i.e., an adiabatic process) the temperature drops as the domains absorb the thermal energy to perform their reorientation.  The randomization of the domains occurs in a similar fashion to the randomization at the [[curie temperature]] of a [[ferromagnetic]] material, except that [[magnetic dipole]]s overcome a decreasing external magnetic field while energy remains constant, instead of magnetic domains being disrupted from internal [[ferromagnetism]] as energy is added.

One of the most notable examples of the magnetocaloric effect is in the chemical element [[gadolinium]] and some of its [[alloys]]. Gadolinium's temperature increases when it enters certain magnetic fields. When it leaves the magnetic field, the temperature drops. The effect is considerably stronger for the gadolinium [[alloy]] ({{chem|Gd|5|Si|2|Ge|2}}).&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite web|author=Karl Gschneidner, Jr. |author2=Kerry Gibson |last-author-amp=yes |title=Magnetic Refrigerator Successfully Tested |website=Ames Laboratory News Release |publisher=Ames Laboratory |date=December 7, 2001 |url=http://www.external.ameslab.gov/news/release/01magneticrefrig.htm |accessdate=2006-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323011159/http://www.external.ameslab.gov/news/release/01magneticrefrig.htm |archivedate=March 23, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Praseodymium]] alloyed with [[nickel]] ({{chem|Pr|Ni|5}}) has such a strong magnetocaloric effect that it has allowed scientists to approach to within one milliKelvin, one thousandth of a degree of [[absolute zero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Emsley | first = John| title = Nature's Building Blocks | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] |date= 2001 | page = 342 | isbn = 978-0-19-850341-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equation ===

The magnetocaloric effect can be quantified with the equation below:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta T_{ad}=-\int_{H_0}^{H_1}\Bigg(\frac {T}{C(T,H)}\Bigg)_H{\Bigg(\frac {\partial M(T,H)}{\partial T}\Bigg)}_H dH&lt;/math&gt;

where T is the temperature, H is the applied magnetic field, C is the heat capacity of the working magnet (refrigerant) and M is the magnetization of the refrigerant.

From the equation we can see that magnetocaloric effect can be enhanced by:

* applying a large field
* using a magnet with a small heat capacity
* using a magnet with a large change in magnetization vs. temperature, at a constant magnetic field

=== Thermodynamic cycle ===

[[Image:MCE.gif|right|thumb|400px|Analogy between magnetic refrigeration and vapor cycle or conventional refrigeration. ''H'' = externally applied magnetic field; ''Q'' = heat quantity; ''P'' = pressure; Δ''T''&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt; = adiabatic temperature variation]]

The cycle is performed as a [[refrigeration cycle]] that is analogous to the [[Carnot cycle|Carnot refrigeration cycle]], but with increases and decreases in magnetic field strength instead of increases and decreases in pressure.  It can be described at a starting point whereby the chosen working substance is introduced into a [[magnetic field]], i.e., the magnetic flux density is increased.  The working material is the refrigerant, and starts in thermal equilibrium with the refrigerated environment.

*''Adiabatic magnetization:'' A magnetocaloric substance is placed in an insulated environment.  The increasing external magnetic field (+''H'') causes the magnetic dipoles of the atoms to align, thereby decreasing the material's magnetic [[entropy]] and [[heat capacity]]. Since overall energy is not lost (yet) and therefore total entropy is not reduced (according to thermodynamic laws), the net result is that the substance is heated (''T'' + Δ''T''&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;).
*''Isomagnetic enthalpic transfer:'' This added heat can then be removed (-''Q'') by a fluid or gas—gaseous or liquid [[helium]], for example.  The magnetic field is held constant to prevent the dipoles from reabsorbing the heat.  Once sufficiently cooled, the magnetocaloric substance and the coolant are separated.
* ''Adiabatic demagnetization:''  The substance is returned to another adiabatic (insulated) condition so the total entropy remains constant.  However, this time the magnetic field is decreased (''H'' = 0), the thermal energy causes the magnetic moments to overcome the field, and thus the sample cools, i.e., an adiabatic temperature change.  Energy (and entropy) transfers from thermal entropy to magnetic entropy, measuring the disorder of the magnetic dipoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Statistical Physics |edition=illustrated |first1=João Paulo |last1=Casquilho |first2=Paulo Ivo Cortez |last2=Teixeira |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-05378-6 |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hp-TBQAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hp-TBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 Extract of page 99]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Isomagnetic entropic transfer:''  The magnetic field is held constant to prevent the material from reheating. The material is placed in thermal contact with the environment to be refrigerated. Because the working material is cooler than the refrigerated environment (by design), heat energy migrates into the working material (+''Q'').

Once the refrigerant and refrigerated environment are in thermal equilibrium, the cycle can restart.

=== Applied technique ===

The basic operating principle of an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) is the use of a strong magnetic field to control the entropy of a sample of material, often called the "refrigerant". Magnetic field constrains the orientation of magnetic dipoles in the refrigerant. The stronger the magnetic field, the more aligned the dipoles are,  corresponding to lower entropy and [[specific heat capacity|heat capacity]] because the material has (effectively) lost some of its internal [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. If the refrigerant is kept at a constant temperature through thermal contact with a [[heat]] sink (usually [[liquid helium]]) while the magnetic field is switched on, the refrigerant must lose some energy because it is [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrated]] with the heat sink. When the magnetic field is subsequently switched off, the heat capacity of the refrigerant rises again because the degrees of freedom associated with orientation of the dipoles are once again liberated, pulling their share of [[equipartition of energy|equipartitioned]] energy from the [[kinetic energy|motion]] of the [[molecule]]s, thereby lowering the overall temperature of a [[system]] with decreased energy. Since the system is now [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] when the magnetic field is switched off, the process is adiabatic, i.e., the system can no longer exchange energy with its surroundings (the heat sink), and its temperature decreases below its initial value, that of the heat sink.

The operation of a standard ADR proceeds roughly as follows.  First, a strong magnetic field is applied to the refrigerant, forcing its various magnetic dipoles to align and putting these degrees of freedom of the refrigerant into a state of lowered entropy. The heat sink then absorbs the heat released by the refrigerant due to its loss of entropy. Thermal contact with the heat sink is then broken so that the system is insulated, and the magnetic field is switched off, increasing the heat capacity of the refrigerant, thus decreasing its temperature below the temperature of the heat sink. In practice, the magnetic field is decreased slowly in order to provide continuous cooling and keep the sample at an approximately constant low temperature. Once the field falls to zero or to some low limiting value determined by the properties of the refrigerant, the cooling power of the ADR vanishes, and heat leaks will cause the refrigerant to warm up.

== Working materials ==

The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is an intrinsic property of a magnetic solid. This thermal response of a solid to the application or removal of magnetic fields is maximized when the solid is near its magnetic ordering temperature. Thus, the materials considered for magnetic refrigeration devices should be magnetic materials with a magnetic phase transition temperature near the temperature region of interest.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/aenm.201200167"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/aenm.201200167| title = Materials Challenges for High Performance Magnetocaloric Refrigeration Devices| journal = Advanced Energy Materials| volume = 2| issue = 11| pages = 1288| year = 2012| last1 = Smith | first1 = A. | last2 = Bahl | first2 = C.

K. | last6 = Pryds | first6 = N. }}&lt;/ref&gt; For refrigerators that could be used in the home, this temperature is room temperature. The temperature change can be further increased when the order-parameter of the phase transition changes strongly within the temperature range of interest.&lt;ref name="doi10.1088/0022-327/38/23/R01"/&gt;

The magnitudes of the magnetic entropy and the adiabatic temperature changes are strongly dependent upon the magnetic ordering process. The magnitude is generally small in [[antiferromagnet]]s, [[ferrimagnet]]s and [[spin glass]] systems but can be much larger for ferromagnets that undergo a magnetic phase transition. First order phase transitions are characterized by a discontinuity in the magnetization changes with temperature, resulting in a latent heat.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/aenm.201200167"/&gt; Second order phase transitions do not have this latent heat associated with the phase transition.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/aenm.201200167"/&gt;

In the late 1990s Pecharksy and Gschneidner reported a magnetic entropy change in {{chem|Gd|5|(Si|2|Ge|2|)}} that was about 50% larger than that reported for Gd metal, which had the largest known magnetic entropy change at the time.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.4494| title = Giant Magnetocaloric Effect in Gd_{5}(Si_{2}Ge_{2})| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 78| issue = 23| pages = 4494| year = 1997| last1 = Pecharsky | first1 = V.

Current research has been used to describe alloys with a significant magnetocaloric effect in terms of a thermodynamic system. Literature says that Gd5(Si2Ge2) for example may be described as a thermodynamic system provided it satisfies the condition of being “a quantity of matter or region in space chosen for study”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cengel, Yunus A. |author2= Michael A.

{{chem|Ni|2|Mn-X}} (X = Ga, Co, In, Al, Sb) Heusler alloys are also promising candidates for magnetic cooling applications because they have Curie temperatures near room temperature and, depending on composition, can have martensitic phase transformations near room temperature.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; These materials exhibit the [[magnetic shape memory]] effect and can also be used as actuators, energy harvesting devices, and sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/adma.201002753| pmid = 20957766| title = Size Effects on Magnetic Actuation in Ni-Mn-Ga Shape-Memory Alloys| journal = Advanced Materials| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 216–32| year = 2011| last1 = Dunand | first1 = D.

The development of this technology is very material-dependent and will likely not replace vapor-compression refrigeration without significantly improved materials that are cheap, abundant, and exhibit much larger magnetocaloric effects over a larger range of temperatures. Such materials need to show significant temperature changes under a field of two tesla or less, so that permanent magnets can be used for the production of the magnetic field.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0034-4885/68/6/R04| title = Recent developments in magnetocaloric materials| journal = Reports on Progress in Physics| volume = 68| issue = 6| pages = 1479| year = 2005| last1 = Gschneidnerjr | first1 = K.

=== Paramagnetic salts ===

The original proposed refrigerant was a [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[salt]], such as [[cerium]] [[magnesium]] [[nitrate]].  The active magnetic dipoles in this case are those of the [[electron shell]]s of the paramagnetic atoms.

In a paramagnetic salt ADR, the heat sink is usually provided by a pumped {{chem|4|He}} (about 1.2&amp;nbsp;K) or {{chem|3|He}} (about 0.3&amp;nbsp;K) [[cryostat]].  An easily attainable 1&amp;nbsp;T magnetic field is generally required for initial magnetization. The minimum temperature attainable is determined by the self-magnetization tendencies of the refrigerant salt, but temperatures from 1 to 100 mK are accessible.  [[Dilution refrigerator]]s had for many years supplanted paramagnetic salt ADRs, but interest in space-based and simple to use lab-ADRs has remained, due to the complexity and unreliability of the dilution refrigerator

Eventually paramagnetic salts become either [[diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] or ferromagnetic, limiting the lowest temperature that can be reached using this method.

=== Nuclear demagnetization ===

One variant of adiabatic demagnetization that continues to find substantial research application is nuclear demagnetization refrigeration (NDR).  NDR follows the same principles, but in this case the cooling power arises from the [[spin (physics)#Spin and magnetic moment|magnetic dipoles of the nuclei]] of the refrigerant atoms, rather than their electron configurations.  Since these dipoles are of much smaller magnitude, they are less prone to self-alignment and have lower intrinsic minimum fields.  This allows NDR to cool the nuclear spin system to very low temperatures, often 1 µK or below. Unfortunately, the small magnitudes of nuclear magnetic dipoles also makes them less inclined to align to external fields.  Magnetic fields of 3 teslas or greater are often needed for the initial magnetization step of NDR.

In NDR systems, the initial heat sink must sit at very low temperatures (10–100 mK).  This precooling is often provided by the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator or a paramagnetic salt.

== Commercial development ==

Research and a demonstration proof of concept device in 2001 succeeded in applying commercial-grade materials and permanent magnets at room temperatures to construct a magnetocaloric refrigerator&lt;ref name="Ames Lab-2001"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ameslab.gov/news/ins01-11Magnetic.htm | last = Gibson | first = Kerry | work = INSIDER Newsletter for employees of Ames Laboratory | title = Magnetic Refrigerator Successfully Tested: Ames Laboratory developments help push boundaries of new refrigeration technology | date = November 2001 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527140630/http://www.ameslab.gov/news/ins01-11Magnetic.htm | archivedate = 2010-05-27 | df =  }}(Vol. 112, No.10 )&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 2007, the [[Risø National Laboratory]] (Denmark) at the [[Technical University of Denmark]], claimed to have reached a milestone in their magnetic cooling research when they reported a temperature span of 8.7 K.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.risoe.dk/News_archives/News/2007/0820_magnetisk_koeling.aspx Milestone in magnetic cooling, Risø News, August 20, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905023927/http://www.risoe.dk/News_archives/News/2007/0820_magnetisk_koeling.aspx |date=September 5, 2007 }}. Retrieved August 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They hoped to introduce the first commercial applications of the technology by 2010.

As of 2013 this technology had proven commercially viable only for ultra-low temperature [[cryogenic]] applications available for decades. Magnetocaloric refrigeration systems are composed of pumps, motors, secondary fluids, heat exchangers of different types, magnets and magnetic materials. These processes are greatly affected by irreversibilities and should be adequately considered.
At year-end, Cooltech Applications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooltech-applications.com |title=Cooltech Applications |publisher=Cooltech Applications |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced that its first commercial refrigeration equipment would enter the market in 2014. Cooltech Applications launched their first commercially available magnetic refrigeration system on 20 June 2016.
At the 2015 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in Las Vegas, a consortium of [[Haier]], [[Astronautics Corporation of America]] and [[BASF]] presented the first cooling appliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premiere of cutting-edge magnetocaloric cooling appliance|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnl9m0rSE7U|publisher=BASF|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; BASF claim of their technology a 35% improvement over using compressors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basf-new-business.com/en/projects/e-power-management/solid-state-cooling/|title=BASF New Business GmbH|author=|date=|website=basf-new-business.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current and future uses ===

Thermal and magnetic [[hysteresis]] problems remain to be solved for first-order phase transition materials that exhibit the GMCE.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

One potential application is in [[spacecraft]].

[[Vapor-compression refrigeration]] units typically achieve performance coefficients of 60% of that of a theoretical ideal Carnot cycle, much higher than current MR technology. Small domestic refrigerators are however much less efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/40784-UgOxYh/webviewable/40784.pdf |title=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information - Sponsored by OSTI |publisher=Osti.gov |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 giant anisotropic behaviour of the magnetocaloric effect was found in {{chem|HoMn|2|O|5}} at 10 K. The anisotropy of the
magnetic entropy change gives rise to a large rotating MCE offering the possibility to build simplified, compact, and efficient magnetic cooling systems by rotating it in a constant magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Balli|first=M. |last2=Jandl |first2=S. |last3=Fournier   |first3=P.  |last4=Gospodinov |first4=M.

In 2015 Aprea ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Aprea, C., Greco, A., Maiorino, A. GeoThermag: A geothermal magnetic refrigerator (2015) International Journal of Refrigeration, 59, pp. 75-83.&lt;/ref&gt; presented a new refrigeration concept, GeoThermag, which is a combination of magnetic refrigeration technology with that of low-temperature geothermal energy. To demonstrate the applicability of the GeoThermag technology, they developed a pilot system that consists of a 100-m deep geothermal probe; inside the probe, water flows and is used directly as a regenerating fluid for a magnetic refrigerator operating with gadolinium. The GeoThermag system showed the ability to produce cold water even at 281.8 K in the presence of a heat load of 60 W. In addition, the system has shown the existence of an optimal frequency f AMR, 0.26&amp;nbsp;Hz, for which it was possible to produce cold water at 287.9 K with a thermal load equal to 190 W with a COP of 2.20. Observing the temperature of the cold water that was obtained in the tests, the GeoThermag system showed a good ability to feed the cooling radiant floors and a reduced capacity for feeding the fan coil systems.

== History ==

The effect was discovered first observed by a German physicist  Warburg (1881)&lt;ref name="WARBURG, E. G p. 141-164"/&gt; Subsequently by French physicist [[Pierre Weiss|P. Weiss]] and Swiss physicist [[Auguste Piccard|A. Piccard]] in 1917.&lt;ref name="Weiss 103–109"/&gt;

Major advances first appeared in the late 1920s when cooling via adiabatic demagnetization was independently proposed by chemistry [[Nobel Laureates]] [[Peter Debye]] in 1926 and  [[William F. Giauque]]  in 1927.

It was first demonstrated experimentally by Giauque and his colleague D. P. MacDougall in 1933 for cryogenic purposes when they reached 0.25&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giauque |first=W. F. |last2=MacDougall |first2=D.

In 1997, the first near room-temperature [[proof of concept]] magnetic refrigerator was demonstrated by Karl A. Gschneidner, Jr. by the [[Iowa State University]] at [[Ames Laboratory]]. This event attracted interest from scientists and companies worldwide who started developing new kinds of room temperature materials and magnetic refrigerator designs.&lt;ref name="Ames"/&gt;

A major breakthrough came 2002 when a group at the University of Amsterdam demonstrated the giant magnetocaloric effect in MnFe(P,As) alloys that are based on abundant materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tegus |first=O. |last2=Brück |first2=E. |last3=de Boer |first3=F.

Refrigerators based on the magnetocaloric effect have been demonstrated in laboratories, using magnetic fields starting at 0.6&amp;nbsp;T up to 10&amp;nbsp;T. Magnetic fields above 2&amp;nbsp;T are difficult to produce with permanent magnets and are produced by a [[superconducting magnet]] (1&amp;nbsp;T is about 20,000 times the [[Earth's magnetic field]]).

In one example, Prof. Karl A. Gschneidner, Jr. unveiled a [[proof of concept]] magnetic refrigerator near room temperature on February 20, 1997. He also announced the discovery of the GMCE in {{chem|Gd|5|Si|2|Ge|2}} on June 9, 1997.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  Since then, hundreds of peer-reviewed articles have been written describing materials exhibiting magnetocaloric effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3945">A '''mechanical rectifier''' is a device for converting [[alternating current]] (AC) to [[direct current]] (DC) by means of mechanically operated switches.  The best-known type is the [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]], which is an integral part of a DC [[dynamo]], but before [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] devices became available, independent mechanical rectifiers were used for certain applications. Before the invention of [[semiconductor]]s, rectification at high currents involved serious losses.

There were various vacuum/gas devices, such as the [[mercury arc rectifier]]s, [[thyratron]]s, [[ignitron]]s, and [[vacuum diode]]s. Solid-state technology was in its infancy, represented by [[Metal rectifier|copper oxide]] and [[selenium rectifier]]s. All of these gave excessive forward voltage drop at high currents. One answer was mechanically opening and closing contacts, if this could be done quickly and cleanly enough.

==Vibrator type==

This was the reverse of a [[Vibrator (electronic)|vibrator]] [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]].  An [[electromagnet]], powered by DC through contacts it operated (like a buzzer) (or fed with AC), caused a spring to vibrate and the spring operated change-over contacts which converted the AC to DC.  This arrangement was only suitable for low-power applications, e.g. auto [[radio]]s and was also found in some motorcycle electrical systems, where it was combined with a [[voltage regulator]].

==Motor-driven type==

This operated on the same principle as the vibrator type but the change-over contacts were operated by a [[synchronous motor]].  It was suitable for high-power applications, e.g. [[electrolysis]] cells and [[electrostatic precipitator]]s.

===Still rectifier===
A mechanical rectifier was patented in 1895 (US patent 547043)&lt;ref&gt;http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&amp;NR=547043A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=18951001&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&lt;/ref&gt; by [[William Joseph Still]].  The details are obscure but it appears from the diagram to be similar to a [[third-brush dynamo]].

===BTH rectifier===
The machine shown in the reference &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Mechanical Rectifiers
  |author=Douglas Self 
  |authorlink=Douglas Self 
  |url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/POWER/mechrect/mechrect.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt; was designed by Read and Gimson et al., at [[British Thomson-Houston]] (BTH) [[Rugby, Warwickshire]], [[England]], in the early 1950s. It is a [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] mechanical rectifier working at 220 [[volt]]s and 15,000 [[ampere]]s, and its application was the powering of huge banks of [[Electrolytic cell|electrolysis cells]].

The central shaft was rotated by [[synchronous motor]], driving an [[Eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] with a throw of about 2mm. (0.077 inch) Push-rods from this operated the contacts. The timing was critical, and was adjusted by rotating the position of the eccentric on its shaft, and by sliding wedges between the eccentric and push-rods.

Crucial to this system were the ''commutating reactors'', [[inductor]]s that ensured the contacts closed when the voltage across them was small, and opened when the current was small. Without these, contact wear would have been intolerably heavy. These were series inductors that operated for most of the cycle with saturated cores. When the current decreased below that for saturation, their inductances reduced the current considerably. Contact switching was timed to occur while their cores were un-saturated.

In the USA, similar rectifiers were made by the I-T-E circuit breaker company.

This machinery was undoubtedly successful; its efficiency was determined to be 97.25%. Contact life was never fully determined but considerably exceeded 2000 hours. However, the rapid development of the [[silicon diode]] made it ultimately redundant.

[[File:Reflex klystrons and microwave cavities.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Two microwave cavities ''(left)'' from 1955, each attached by [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] to a [[reflex klystron]] ''(right)'' a [[vacuum tube]] used to generate microwaves. The cavities serve as [[resonator]]s ([[tank circuit]]s) to determine the [[frequency]] of the oscillators]]
 
A '''microwave cavity''' or ''[[radio frequency]] (RF) cavity'' is a special type of [[resonator]], consisting of a closed (or largely closed) metal structure that confines [[electromagnetic fields]] in the [[microwave]] region of the spectrum. The structure is either hollow or filled with [[dielectric]] material.  The microwaves bounce back and forth between the walls of the cavity.  At the cavity's [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]] they reinforce to form [[standing wave]]s in the cavity.    Therefore, the cavity functions similarly to an organ pipe or [[sound box]] in a musical instrument, oscillating preferentially at a series of frequencies, its [[resonant frequency|resonant frequencies]].   Thus it can act as a [[bandpass filter]], allowing microwaves of a particular frequency to pass while blocking microwaves at nearby frequencies.  

A microwave cavity acts similarly to a [[resonant circuit]] with extremely low loss at its [[frequency]] of operation, resulting in [[quality factor]]s (Q factors) up to the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, compared to 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for circuits made with separate [[inductors]] and [[capacitors]] at the same frequency.  They are used in place of resonant circuits at microwave frequencies, since at these frequencies discrete resonant circuits cannot be built because the values of inductance and capacitance needed are too low.  They are used in [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]s and [[transmitter]]s to create microwave signals, and as [[electronic filter|filter]]s to separate a signal at a given frequency from other signals, in equipment such as [[radar]] equipment, [[microwave relay]] stations, satellite communications, and [[microwave oven]]s.

RF cavities can also manipulate [[charged particle]]s passing through them by application of [[acceleration voltage]] and are thus used in [[particle accelerator]]s and microwave [[vacuum tube]]s such as [[klystron]]s and [[magnetron]]s.

== Theory of operation ==
[[File:Topfkrk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The inside of a cavity from a Russian military [[radar]] [[transmitter]], with the cover removed. The cavity serves as the [[resonant circuit]] of an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] using the [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] inside.  Parts:&lt;br/&gt;(1) A setscrew [[trimmer capacitor]] used to adjust the [[frequency]]&lt;br/&gt;(2) The top of the GS13-1 [[triode]] which generates the microwaves&lt;br/&gt;(3) A wire coupling loop from which the output power is taken]]

Most resonant cavities are made from closed (or short-circuited) sections of [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] or high-[[permittivity]] [[dielectric]] material (see [[dielectric resonator]]). Electric and magnetic energy is stored in the cavity and the only losses are due to finite [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] of cavity walls and [[Loss tangent|dielectric losses]] of material filling the cavity. Every cavity has numerous resonant frequencies that correspond to electromagnetic field modes satisfying necessary boundary conditions on the walls of the cavity. Because of these boundary conditions that must be satisfied at resonance (tangential electric fields must be zero at cavity walls), it follows that cavity length must be an integer multiple of half-wavelength at resonance.&lt;ref name="pozar"&gt;David Pozar, Microwave Engineering, 2nd edition, Wiley, New York, NY, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, a resonant cavity can be thought of as a waveguide equivalent of short circuited half-wavelength [[transmission line]] resonator.&lt;ref name="pozar" /&gt; [[Q factor]] of a resonant cavity can be calculated using [[Cavity Perturbation Theory|cavity perturbation theory]] and expressions for stored electric and magnetic energy.

The electromagnetic fields in the cavity are excited via external coupling. An external power source is usually coupled to the cavity by a small [[aperture]], a small wire probe or a loop.&lt;ref name="collin"&gt;R. E. Collin, Foundations for Microwave Engineering, 2nd edition, IEEE Press, New York, NY, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; External coupling structure has an effect on cavity performance and needs to be considered in the overall analysis.&lt;ref name="montgomery"&gt;Montgomery, C. G. &amp; Dicke, Robert H. &amp; Edward M. Purcell, Principles of microwave circuits / edited by C.G. Montgomery, R.H. Dicke, E.M. Purcell,  Peter Peregrinus on behalf of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, London, U.K., 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;




=== Resonant frequencies ===
The resonant frequencies of a cavity can be calculated from its dimensions.

==== Rectangular cavity ====
[[File:Rectangular cavity.JPG|thumb|Rectangular cavity]]

Resonance frequencies of a rectangular microwave cavity for any [[Transverse mode|&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle TE_{mnl}&lt;/math&gt;]] or [[Transverse mode|&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle TM_{mnl}&lt;/math&gt;]] resonant mode can be found by imposing boundary conditions on electromagnetic field expressions. This frequency is given by&lt;ref name="pozar" /&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  f_{mnl} &amp;= \frac{c}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu_r\epsilon_r}}\cdot k_{mnl}\\
          &amp;= \frac{c}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu_r\epsilon_r}}\sqrt{\left(\frac{m\pi}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{n\pi}{b}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{l\pi}{d}\right)^2}\\
          &amp;= \frac{c}{2\sqrt{\mu_r\epsilon_r}}\sqrt{\left( \frac{m}{a}\right) ^2+\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) ^2 + \left(\frac{l}{d}\right) ^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle k_{mnl}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavenumber]], with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle l&lt;/math&gt; being the mode numbers and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle d&lt;/math&gt; being the corresponding dimensions; c is the speed of light in vacuum; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mu_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \epsilon_r&lt;/math&gt; are relative [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and [[permittivity]] of the cavity filling respectively.
{{breakafterimages}}

==== Cylindrical cavity ====
[[File:Cylindrical cavity.svg|thumb|Cylindrical cavity]]

The field solutions of a cylindrical cavity of length &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle L&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt; follow from the solutions of a cylindrical [[waveguide]] with additional electric boundary conditions at the position of the enclosing plates. The resonance frequencies are different for TE and TM modes.

;TM modes:&lt;ref name="wangler"&gt;T. Wangler, ''RF linear accelerators'', Wiley (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;f_{mnp}=\frac{c}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu_r\epsilon_r}} \sqrt{\left(\frac{X_{mn}}{R}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{p \pi}{L}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

;TE modes:&lt;ref name="wangler" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;f_{mnp}=\frac{c}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu_r\epsilon_r}} \sqrt{\left(\frac{X'_{mn}}{R}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{p \pi}{L}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-th zero of the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m&lt;/math&gt;-th [[Bessel function]], and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X'_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n&lt;/math&gt;-th zero of the ''derivative'' of the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m&lt;/math&gt;-th Bessel function.

=== Quality factor ===
The [[quality factor]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Q&lt;/math&gt; of a cavity can be decomposed into three parts, representing different power loss mechanisms.

*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Q_c&lt;/math&gt;, resulting from the power loss in the walls which have finite conductivity{{clarify|What is l?|date=October 2012}}
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;Q_c = \frac{(kad)^3b\eta}{2\pi^2R_s} \cdot \frac{1}{l^2a^3\left(2b + d\right) + \left(2b + a\right)d^3}\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Q_d&lt;/math&gt;, resulting from the power loss in the lossy [[dielectric]] material filling the cavity. 
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;Q_d = \frac{1}{\tan \delta}\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
*&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Q_{ext}&lt;/math&gt;, resulting from power loss through unclosed surfaces (holes) of the cavity geometry.

Total Q factor of the cavity can be found as&lt;ref name="pozar" /&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;Q = \left( \frac{1}{Q_c}+\frac{1}{Q_d}\right) ^{-1}\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where k is the [[wavenumber]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \eta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Wave impedance|intrinsic impedance]] of the dielectric, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_s&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|surface resistivity]] of the cavity walls, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mu_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \epsilon_r&lt;/math&gt; are relative [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and [[permittivity]] respectively and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tan \delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[loss tangent]] of the dielectric.

== Comparison to LC circuits ==

[[File:LC cavity.JPG|thumb|LC cavity|LC circuit equivalent for microwave resonant cavity]]

Microwave resonant cavities can be represented and thought of as simple [[LC circuit]]s.&lt;ref name="montgomery" /&gt; For a microwave cavity, the stored electric energy is equal to the stored magnetic energy at resonance as is the case for a resonant [[LC circuit]]. In terms of inductance and capacitance, the resonant frequency for a given &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle mnl&lt;/math&gt; mode can be written as&lt;ref name="montgomery" /&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;L_{mnl} = \mu k_{mnl}^2V\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;C_{mnl} = \frac{\epsilon}{k_{mnl}^4V}\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  f_{mnl} &amp;= \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{L_{mnl}C_{mnl}}}\\
          &amp;= \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\frac{1}{k_{mnl}^2} \mu\epsilon}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

where V is the cavity volume, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle k_{mnl}&lt;/math&gt; is the mode wavenumber and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mu&lt;/math&gt; are permittivity and permeability respectively.

To better understand the utility of resonant cavities at microwave frequencies, it is useful to note that the losses of conventional inductors and capacitors start to increase with frequency in the [[VHF]] range. Similarly, for frequencies above one [[gigahertz]], Q factor values for transmission-line resonators start to decrease with frequency.&lt;ref name="collin" /&gt; Because of their low losses and high Q factors, cavity resonators are preferred over conventional LC and transmission-line resonators at high frequencies.

=== Losses in LC resonant circuits ===
[[File:Ondamtr.JPG|thumb|An absorption [[wavemeter]].  It consists of an adjustable cavity calibrated in frequency.  When the resonant frequency of the cavity reaches the frequency of the applied microwaves it absorbs energy, causing a dip in the output power.  Then the frequency can be read off the scale.  ]]

Conventional inductors are usually wound from wire in the shape of a [[helix]] with no core.  [[Skin effect]] causes the high frequency resistance of inductors to be many times their [[direct current]] resistance.  In addition, capacitance between turns causes [[dielectric]] losses in the [[Insulator (electrical)|insulation]] which coats the wires.  These effects make the high frequency resistance greater and decrease the Q factor.

Conventional capacitors use [[air]], [[mica]], [[ceramic]] or perhaps [[teflon]] for a dielectric.  Even with a low loss dielectric, capacitors are also subject to skin effect losses in their [[lead (electronics)|leads]] and [[plate (electronics)|plates]].  Both effects increase their [[equivalent series resistance]] and reduce their Q.

Even if the Q factor of VHF inductors and capacitors is high enough to be useful, their [[Parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic]] properties can significantly affect their performance in this frequency range.  The shunt capacitance of an inductor may be more significant than its desirable series inductance. The series inductance of a capacitor may be more significant than its desirable shunt capacitance.  As a result, in the VHF or microwave regions, a capacitor may appear to be an inductor and an inductor may appear to be a capacitor. These phenomena are better known as [[Parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic inductance]] and [[parasitic capacitance]].

=== Losses in cavity resonators ===

Dielectric loss of air is extremely low for high-frequency electric or magnetic fields.  Air-filled microwave cavities confine electric and magnetic fields to the air spaces between their walls.  Electric losses in such cavities are almost exclusively due to currents flowing in cavity walls. While losses from wall currents are small, cavities are frequently [[plated]] with [[silver]] to increase their [[electrical conductivity]] and reduce these losses even further.  [[Copper]] cavities frequently [[oxidize]], which increases their loss.  Silver or [[gold]] plating prevents oxidation and reduces electrical losses in cavity walls.  Even though gold is not quite as good a conductor as copper, it still prevents oxidation and the resulting deterioration of Q factor over time.  However, because of its high cost, it is used only in the most demanding applications.

Some satellite resonators are silver-plated and covered with a [[gold flash]] layer. The current then mostly flows in the high-conductivity silver layer, while the gold flash layer protects the silver layer from oxidizing.

'''Nuclear power in space''' is the use of [[nuclear power]] in [[outer space]], typically either small fission systems or radioactive decay for electricity or heat. Another use is for scientific observation, as in a [[Mössbauer spectrometer]]. One common type is a [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]], which has been used on many space probes and on manned lunar missions, and another is small fission reactors for Earth observation satellites such as the [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hyder | first = Anthony K. | authorlink = |author2=R.

Examples of nuclear power for space propulsion systems include [[nuclear electric rocket]] (nuclear electric propulsion), [[radioisotope rocket]], and radioisotope electric propulsion (REP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/mcnuttstaif06.pdf |format=PDF |title=Radioisotope Electric Propulsion : Enabling the Decadal Survey Science Goals for Primitive Bodies |website=Lpi.usra.edu |accessdate=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more explored is the [[nuclear thermal rocket]], which was tested in the [[NERVA]] program.

While [[solar power]] is much more commonly used, nuclear power offers great advantages in many areas. Solar cells, although efficient, can only supply energy to spacecraft in orbits where the solar flux is sufficiently high, such as low Earth orbit and interplanetary destinations close enough to the Sun. Unlike solar cells, nuclear power systems function independently of sunlight, which is necessary for [[deep space exploration]]. Nuclear reactors are especially beneficial in space because of their lower weight-to-capacity ratio than solar cells. Therefore, nuclear power systems take up much less space than solar power systems. Compact spacecraft are easier to orient and direct in space when precision is needed. Estimates of nuclear power, which can power both life support and propulsion systems, suggest that use of these systems can effectively reduce both cost and flight time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zaitsev|first=Yury|title=Nuclear Power In Space|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Nuclear_Power_In_Space_999.html|work=Spacedaily|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radioisotope systems===
[[File:SNAP-27 on the Moon.jpg|thumb|SNAP-27 on the Moon]]
For more than fifty years, [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s (RTGs) have been the United States’ main nuclear power source in space. RTGs offer many benefits; they are relatively safe and maintenance-free, are resilient under harsh conditions, and can operate for decades. RTGs are particularly desirable for use in parts of space where solar power is not a viable power source. Dozens of RTGs have been implemented to power 25 different US spacecraft, some of which have been operating for more than 20 years. Over 40 [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s have been used globally (principally US and USSR) on space missions.&lt;ref name="nasa/doe2010"&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Mason|first1=Lee |author2=Sterling Bailey|author3=Ryan Bechtel|author4=John Elliott|author16=Jean-Pierre Fleurial|author5=Mike Houts|author6=Rick Kapernick|author7=Ron Lipinski|author8=Duncan MacPherson|author9=Tom Moreno|author10=Bill Nesmith|author11=Dave Poston|author12=Lou Qualls|author13=Ross Radel|author14=Abraham Weitzberg|author15=Jim Werner |title=Small Fission Power System Feasibility Study — Final Report |url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=32899.0;attach=543853 |accessdate=3 October 2015 |agency=[[NASA]]/[[US DOE|DOE]] |date=18 November 2010 |quote=''Space Nuclear Power: Since 1961 the U.S. has flown more than 40 Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) with an essentially perfect operational record. The specifics of these RTGs and the missions they have powered have been thoroughly reviewed in the open literature. The U.S. has flown only one reactor, which is described below. The Soviet Union has flown only 2 RTGs and had shown a preference to use small fission power systems instead of RTGs. The USSR had a more aggressive space fission power program than the U.S. and flew more than 30 reactors. Although these were designed for short lifetime, the program demonstrated the successful use of common designs and technology.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[advanced Stirling radioisotope generator]] (ASRG, a model of [[Stirling radioisotope generator]] (SRG)) produces roughly four times the electric power of an RTG per unit of nuclear fuel, but it is not yet ready to be implemented on an actual mission. NASA plans to utilize two ASRGs to explore [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] in the distant future.

[[File:ASRG Labeled Cutaway (English).jpg|thumb|Cutaway diagram of the advanced Stirling radioisotope generator.]]

Radioisotope power generators include:
*SNAP-19, SNAP-27 ([[Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power]])
*[[MHW-RTG]]
*[[GPHS-RTG]]
*[[MMRTG]]
*[[Advanced Stirling radioisotope generator|ASRG]] (Advanced Stirling radioisotope generator)

[[Radioisotope heater unit]]s (RHUs) are also used on spacecraft to warm scientific instruments to the proper temperature so they operate efficiently.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} A larger model of RHU called the [[General Purpose Heat Source]] (GPHS) is used  to power RTGs and the ASRG.

Extremely slow-decaying radioisotopes have been proposed for use on realistic interstellar probes with multi-decade lifetimes.&lt;ref name="Ref_t"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interstellarexplorer.jhuapl.edu/index.php |title=Innovative Interstellar Probe |publisher=[[Applied Physics Laboratory|JHU/APL]] |accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another direction for development is an RTG assisted by subcritical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arias|first=F. J.|date=2011|title=Advanced Subcritical Assistance Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator: An Imperative Solution for the Future of NASA Exploration|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2011.64.314|journal=[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|JBIS]]|volume=64|pages=314–318|bibcode=2011JBIS...64..314A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fission systems===
Fission power systems may be utilized to power a spacecraft’s heating or propulsion systems.

In terms of heating requirements, when spacecraft require more than 100&amp;nbsp;kW for power, fission systems are much more cost effective than RTGs. Over the past few decades, several fission reactors have been proposed, but these fission systems haven’t been utilized in US space projects as prominently as radioisotope systems have. The Soviet Union, however, launched 31 [[BES-5]] low power fission reactors in their [[US-A|RORSAT]] satellites utilizing thermoelectric converters between 1967 and 1988. Shortly after, the Soviet Union developed [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor|TOPAZ reactors]], which utilize thermionic converters instead. 
In 2008, NASA announced plans to utilize a small fission power system to be used on the surface of the moon and Mars, and began testing "key" technologies for it to come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sservi.nasa.gov/articles/a-lunar-nuclear-reactor/ |title=A Lunar Nuclear Reactor &amp;#124; Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute |website=Sservi.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear thermal propulsion systems (NTR) are based on the heating power of a fission reactor, offering a more efficient propulsion system for thrust in launches and landings than one powered by chemical reactions. Current research focuses more on nuclear electric systems as the power source for providing thrust to propel spacecraft that are already in space. 
[[File:SAFE-30 Reactor.png|thumb|[[Safe Affordable Fission Engine|SAFE-30]] small experimental reactor circa 2002]]
Other space fission reactors for powering space vehicles include the [[Safe affordable fission engine|SAFE-400]] reactor and the HOMER-15. In 2020, Roscosmos (the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]]) plans to launch a spacecraft utilizing nuclear-powered propulsion systems (developed at the [[Keldysh Research Center]]), which includes a small gas-cooled fission reactor with 1 MWe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/05/russia_nasa_nuclear_spacecraft/|title=Russia, NASA to hold talks on nuclear-powered spacecraft Muscovites have the balls but not the money|last=Page|first=Lewis|date=5 April 2011|publisher=[[The Register]]|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/10/25/breakthrough_in_quest_for_nuclear-powered_spacecraft_18625.html|title=Breakthrough in quest for nuclear-powered spacecraft|date=October 25, 2012|publisher=Rossiiskaya Gazeta|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2010}}, more than 30 small fission power system nuclear reactors have been sent into space in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[RORSAT]] satellites, with only one—[[SNAP-10A]]—by the [[Federal government of the United States|US]].

Proposed fission power system spacecraft and exploration systems have included [[SP-100]], [[JIMO nuclear electric propulsion]], and [[Fission Surface Power]].&lt;ref name="nasa/doe2010"/&gt;

===Project Prometheus===

In 2002, NASA announced an initiative towards developing nuclear systems, which later came to be known as [[Project Prometheus]]. A major part of the Prometheus Project was to develop the Stirling Radioisotope Generator and the Multi-Mission Thermoelectric Generator, both types of RTGs. The project also aimed to produce a safe and long-lasting space fission reactor system for a spacecraft’s power and propulsion, replacing the long-used RTGs. Budget constraints resulted in the effective halting of the project, but Project Prometheus has had success in testing new systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Reactors for Space|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Non-Power-Nuclear-Applications/Transport/Nuclear-Reactors-for-Space/#.UT1x3VpRgz1|publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]]|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After its creation, scientists successfully tested a [[High Power Electric Propulsion]] (HiPEP) ion engine, which offered substantial advantages in fuel efficiency, thruster lifetime, and thruster efficiency over other power sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Successfully Tests Ion Engine|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/11/031121072826.htm|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="678">The '''PT Mi-Ba-II''' is a large [[Bakerlite]] cased [[Czechoslovakia]]n [[anti-tank mine|anti-tank blast mine]]. The mine is unusual in that it has two plunger fuses instead of a pressure plate. The plunger fuses give the mine resistance to overpressure, also the plastic body makes it difficult to detect. 

The mine is no longer produced, and it is found in Africa.

==Specifications==
* Length: 395 mm
* Height: 135 mm
* Width: 230 mm

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2971">The '''power loss factor''' β describes the loss of electrical power in [[cogeneration|CHP]] systems with a variable power-to-heat ratio when an increasing heat flow is extracted from the main [[thermodynamic]] [[electricity]] generating process in order to provide useful [[heat]]. Usually, the power loss factor refers to extraction [[steam turbine]]s in [[thermal power station]]s, which conduct a part of the steam in a heating condenser for the production of useful heat, instead of the low pressure part of the steam turbine where is could perform mechanical work.

[[File:CHP principle and T-s-diagram.png|thumb|Power loss within an extraction steam turbine: CHP plant section (left) and T-s-diagram (right)]]

&lt;math&gt; \beta = \frac{\Delta P_\text{el}}{\dot Q_\text{utile}} &lt;/math&gt;

The picture on the right shows in the left part the principle of steam extraction. After the intermediate-pressure section of the turbine, i.e. before the low-pressure section, steam is diverted and flows into the heating condenser, where it transfers heat to the heating circuit (temperature level T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; about 100&amp;nbsp;°C) and liquefies. The remaining steam works in the low-pressure section of the turbine and is then liquefied in the condenser at approx. 30&amp;nbsp;°C. Then it is fed via the condensate pump to the feedwater circuit. The partial steam flow, which goes into the heating condenser at high temperature can no longer work in the low-pressure section and is responsible for the loss of power.

The right-hand side of the picture shows the associated [[T-s diagram]] (see [[Rankine cycle]]) for an operating state in which half of the waste heat is used for heating purposes. To the left of the red sqare, the white area below the red line corresponds to the waste heat (q&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;), which is released via the condenser to the environment (ambient temperature level T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;). The entire red area corresponds to the useful heat (q&lt;sub&gt;heat&lt;/sub&gt;), the upper hatched part of this area corresponds to the power loss in the low pressure stage.

Modern cogeneration plants have power loss ratios of about 1/5 to 1/9 when delivering heat in the range of 80&amp;nbsp;°C-120&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Danny Harvey: [https://www.decentralized-energy.com/articles/print/volume-7/issue-5/features/clean-building-contribution-from-cogeneration-trigeneration-and-district-energy.html Clean building - contribution from cogeneration, trigeneration and district energy], Cogeneration and On-Site Power Production, september–october 2006, pp. 107-115 (Fig. 1)&lt;/ref&gt; That means in exchange of one kWh of electrical energy ca. 5 up to 9 kWh of useful heat are obtained.

Based on the [[Equivalence number method|equivalence]] of power loss and gain of heat, the power loss method assigns CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and primary energy from the fuel to the useful heat and the electrical energy.

A '''Product fit analysis''' (PFA) is a form of [[requirements analysis]] of the gap between an IT product's functionality and required functions.

It is a document which consists of all the business requirements which are mapped to the product or application.

Requirements are specifically mentioned and the application is designed accordingly.

PFA document is designed covering all the functionality required by the business and how it is addressed in the application.
It covers all the data inputs, data processing and data outputs.

The '''SDEP''' ('''Street events Data Exchange Protocol''') comprises an [[XML schema|XML data schema]] and web service [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] for exchanging information about streetworks, roadworks, and street events between systems.

Elgin was funded by the UK NeSDS Government e-Standards Programme to conduct a consultation and convene meetings to define the requirements of a common data exchange protocol for streetworks registers and other systems handling street events data. SDEP was developed to allow the open exchange of such data between back office systems used by [[local authorities]] to manage their highway networks in order to enable [[EGovernment|e-Government]] and streetworks co-ordination.

The SDEP consultation group comprised ELGIN (Chair), Mayrise Ltd., Symology Ltd., [[Pitney Bowes|Pitney Bowes Inc.]], [[Bentley Systems|Exor Corporation (Bentley Systems)]], &lt;!-- [[Northamptonshire|Northamptonshire County Council]] (representing the --&gt;[[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]]&lt;!--)--&gt; and [[Transport for London]], with the [[Highways Agency|National Traffic Control Centre]] in an observing capacity.

In the study of [[complex systems]] and [[hierarchy theory]], the concept of scale refers to the combination of (1) the level of analysis (for example, analyzing the whole or a specific component of the system); and (2) the level of observation (for example, observing a system as an external viewer or as an internal participant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ahl |first1=Valerie |last2=Allen |first2=Timothy F.

For example, on at the scale of analysis of a given population of zebras, the number of predators (e.g. lions) determines the number of preys that survives after hunting, while at the scale of analysis of the ecosystem, the availability of preys determines how many predators can survive in a given area. The semantic categories of "prey" and "predator" are not given, but are defined by the observer.

The '''Scottish Union of Bakers and Allied Workers''' was a [[trade union]] representing bakers and confectioners in [[Scotland]].

The union was founded in 1888, when it was known as the '''Operative Bakers' National Federal Union of Scotland'''.  By the following year, it had more than 3,000 members, but a decision to undertake a national strike led many new members to resign.  Membership fell below 2,000 before gradually increasing, rising above 5,000 by 1910, and to around 7,500 by 1923.&lt;ref name="marsh"&gt;Arthur Marsh and John B. Smethurst, ''Historical Directory of Trade Unions'', vol.5, pp.184-185&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], the union changed its name to the '''Operative Bakers and Confectioners of Scotland National Federal Union''', then to the '''Scottish Union of Bakers and Confectioners''' in 1923, and to the '''Scottish Union of Bakers, Confectioners and Bakery Workers''' in 1927.  From 1926, the union accepted women as members, and sought to become an [[industrial union]], including unskilled workers in the industry.&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;

In 1949, the union again changed its name, to the lengthy '''Scottish Union of Bakers, Confectioners, Biscuit Bakers and Bakery Workers''', shortening this in 1955 to the "Scottish Union of Bakers and Allied Workers".&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;

Membership of the union peaked in 1971 at 11,713, but fell below 9,000 as the decade progressed.  As a result, it decided to merge into the [[Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;

==Election results==
The union sponsored Norman Hogg, its national organiser, as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate in a Parliamentary election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=List of Parliamentary Labour candidates and election results, February 23rd, 1950 |journal=Annual Report of the Labour Party |date=1950 |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Webster |first1=Jack |title=Jack Webster's Aberdeen |date=2007 |publisher=Birlinn |isbn=1841584789 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sowing machine Nordsten.jpg|thumb|300px|A sowing machine which uses the seed drill concept]]

A '''seed drill''' is a device that [[sowing|sows]] the [[seed]]s for [[crop]]s by metering out the individual seeds, positioning them in the [[soil]], and covering them to a certain average depth. This makes sure the seed will be placed evenly.

The seed drill sows the seeds at equal distances and proper depth, ensuring that the seeds get covered with soil and are saved from being eaten by birds and being blown by the wind. This allows plants to get sufficient sunlight, nutrients, and water from the soil. Before the introduction of the seed drill, a common practice was to plant seeds by hand. Besides being wasteful, planting was usually imprecise and led to a poor distribution of [[seeds]], leading to low productivity. The use of a seed drill can improve the ratio of crop yield (seeds harvested per seed planted) by as much as nine times. 

Some machines for metering out seeds for planting are called [[planter (farm implement)|planters]]. The concepts evolved from ancient Chinese practice and later evolved into mechanisms that pick up seeds from a bin and deposit them down a tube. 

Seed drills of earlier centuries included single-tube seed drills in [[Sumer]] and multi-tube seed drills in [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  and later a seed drill by [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] that was influential in the growth of farming technology in recent centuries. Even for a century after Tull, hand sowing of grain remained common.

== Design ==
In older methods of planting, a field is initially prepared with a [[plow]] to a series of linear cuts known as ''furrows''. The field is then seeded by throwing the seeds over the field, a method known as ''manual broadcasting''. The seeds may not be sown to the right depth nor the proper distance from one another. Seeds that land in the furrows have better protection from the elements, and natural erosion or manual raking will cover them while leaving some exposed. The result is a field planted roughly in rows, but having a large number of plants outside the furrow lanes.

There are several downsides to this approach. The most obvious is that seeds that land outside the furrows will not have the growth shown by the plants sown in the furrow since they are too shallow on the soil. Because of this, they are lost to the elements. Many of the seeds remain on the surface where they are vulnerable to being eaten by birds or carried away on the wind. Surface seeds commonly never germinate at all or germinate prematurely, only to be killed by frost.

Since the furrows represent only a portion of the field's area, and broadcasting distributes seeds fairly evenly, this results in considerable wastage of seeds. Less obvious are the effects of overseeding; all crops grow best at a certain density, which varies depending on the soil and weather conditions. Additional seeding above this limit will actually reduce crop yields, in spite of more plants being sown, as there will be competition among the plants for the minerals, water, and the soil available. Another reason is that the mineral resources of the soil will also deplete at a much faster rate, thereby directly affecting the growth of the plants.

The invention of the seed drill dramatically improved germination. The seed drill employed a series of runners spaced at the same distance as the plowed furrows. These runners, or drills, opened the furrow to a uniform depth before the seed was dropped. Behind the drills were a series of presses, metal discs which cut down the sides of the trench into which the seeds had been planted, covering them over.

This innovation permitted farmers to have precise control over the depth at which seeds were planted. This greater measure of control meant that fewer seeds germinated early or late and that seeds were able to take optimum advantage of available soil moisture in a prepared seedbed. The result was that farmers were able to use less seed and at the same time experience larger yields than under the broadcast methods.

==History==
[[Image:ChineseSeedDrill1637.jpg|thumb|[[China|Chinese]] double-tube seed drill, published by [[Song Yingxing]] in the ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' [[encyclopedia]] of 1637.]]
While the Babylonians used primitive seed drills around 1400 BCE, the invention never reached Europe. Multi-tube iron seed drills were invented by the Chinese in the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;History Channel, ''Where Did It Come From?''

The first known European seed drill was attributed to Camillo Torello and patented by the Venetian Senate in 1566. A seed drill was described in detail by Tadeo Cavalina of [[Bologna]] in 1602.&lt;ref name="temple" /&gt; In [[England]], the seed drill was further refined by [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] in 1701 in the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]]. However, seed drills of this and successive types were both expensive and unreliable, as well as fragile. Seed drills would not come into widespread use in Europe until the mid to late 19th century, when manufacturing advances such as [[machine tool]]s, die forging and metal stamping allowed large scale precision manufacturing of metal parts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early drills were small enough to be pulled by a single horse, and many of these remained in use into the 1930s. The availability of steam, and later gasoline tractors, however, saw the development of larger and more efficient drills that allowed farmers to seed ever larger tracts in a single day.

Recent improvements to drills allow seed-drilling without prior tilling. This means that soils subject to erosion or moisture loss are protected until the seed germinates and grows enough to keep the soil in place. This also helps prevent [[soil loss]] by avoiding erosion after tilling. The development of the press drill was one of the major innovations in pre-1900 farming technology.

[[File:1902 Monitor seed drill detail.jpg|thumb|1902 model 12-run seed drill produced by [[Monitor Manufacturing Company]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]].]]
''Drilling'' is the term used for the mechanized [[sowing]] of an agricultural crop. Traditionally, a seed drill used to consist of a hopper filled with seeds arranged above a series of tubes that can be set at selected distances from each other to allow optimum growth of the resulting plants. Seeds are spaced out using fluted paddles which rotate using a geared drive from one of the drill's land wheels—seed rate is altered by changing gear ratios. Most modern drills use air to convey seed in plastic tubes from the seed hopper to the coulters—it is an arrangement which allows seed drills to be much wider than the seed hopper—as much as 12 m wide in some cases. The seed is metered mechanically into an air stream created by a hydraulically powered onboard fan and conveyed initially to a distribution head which sub-divides the seed into the pipes taking the seed to the individual colters.

The seed drill allows farmers to sow seeds in well-spaced rows at specific depths at a specific seed rate; each tube creates a hole of a specific depth, drops in one or more seeds, and covers it over. This invention gives farmers much greater control over the depth that the seed is planted and the ability to cover the seeds without back-tracking. The result is an increased rate of germination, and a much-improved [[crop yield]] (up to eight times&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_VPNPPGN The story of wheat | Ears of plenty | Economist.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] Paid subscription required&lt;/ref&gt;).

The use of a seed drill also facilitates weed control. Broadcast seeding results in a random array of growing crops, making it difficult to control [[weed]]s using any method other than hand weeding. A field planted using a seed drill is much more uniform, typically in rows, allowing weeding with the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] during the growing season. Weeding by hand is laborious and inefficient. Poor weeding reduces crop yield, so this benefit is extremely significant.

The ground would have to be plowed and harrowed. The plow would dig up the earth and the harrow would smooth the soil and break up any clumps. The drill would be set for the size of the seed used. Then the grain would be put in the hopper on top and then follow along behind it while the seed drill spaced and planted the seed. This system is still used today but it has been modified and updated so a farmer can plant many rows of seed at the same time.

A seed drill can be pulled across the field using bullocks or a tractor. Seeds sown using a seed drill are distributed evenly and placed at the correct depth in the soil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7942">In photography, '''shutter lag''' is the delay between triggering the shutter and when the [[photograph]] is actually recorded.  This is a common problem in the [[photography]] of fast-moving objects or people in motion. The term narrowly refers only to shutter effects, but more broadly refers to all lag between when the [[shutter button]] is pressed and when the photo is taken, including metering and focus lag.

== Film cameras ==
In [[film camera]]s, the delay is caused by the mechanism inside the camera that opens the [[shutter (photography)|shutter]], exposing the film.  Because the process is mechanical, however, and relatively brief, shutter lag in film cameras is often only noticeable (and of any concern) to professionals. [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]]s have slightly longer shutter lag than rangefinders, because of the need to lift the mirror.  [[Point-and-shoot camera|Point and shoot]] film cameras often have significant shutter lag.

== Digital cameras ==
Shutter lag is much more of a problem with [[digital camera]]s.  Here, the delay results from the charging of the [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] and relatively slow transmission of its capture data to the circuitry of the camera for processing and storage.  Recent improvements in technology, however, such as the speed, [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and power consumption of processor chips and memory, as well as [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] technology, have made shutter lag less of a problem.  As of 2007, the greatest advancements have been limited mostly to professional, "[[prosumer]]," and high-end consumer-grade digital cameras.  Inexpensive (most "point-and-shoot") digital cameras, however, have even reduced the average shutter lag to half seconds, and higher-end "point-and-shoot" cameras have reduced this down to a quarter second or less.

== AE &amp; AF lag ==
However, what many people consider shutter lag is in fact the time the camera takes to meter (set the [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]]) and auto-focus, which is lag of a different cause but similar effect.

These causes of lag can be eliminated by pre-setting the exposure and focus, by either manually setting the exposure and focus, or by pre-exposing and pre-focusing. Pre-exposing and pre-focusing mean "using [[automatic exposure]] and autofocus, then fixing the settings so they do not change"; this can often be done by holding the shutter release halfway down, or by using a separate "AE / AF lock" button (useful if taking multiple photographs that are not in a burst), and means the subsequent photographs will be taken faster. These techniques can be combined – one can manually set the exposure and then use AF lock or conversely.

He joined IBM in 1982 as a World Trade Post-doctoral Fellow, becoming a permanent member of the staff the following year. In 1999 he was named an IBM Fellow, IBM's highest technical honour.&lt;ref name="humboldt-foundation"/&gt;

==Research and career==
In 2007 Parkin was named a Distinguished Visiting Professor at the [[National University of Singapore]], a Visiting Chair Professor at the [[National Taiwan University]], and an Honorary Visiting Professor at [[University College London]], The United Kingdom.  In 2008, he was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=04292008 Election to U.S. National Academy of Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt; The Materials Research Network Dresden granted him the Dresden Barkhausen Award in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfd-dresden.com/en/events/barkhausen-award/awardees.html|title=List of the Barkhausen Awardees|publisher=Materials Research Network Dresden|accessdate=9 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124839/http://www.mfd-dresden.com/en/events/barkhausen-award/awardees.html|archivedate=13 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parkin has been awarded honorary doctorates by the [[RWTH Aachen|University of Aachen]], Germany and the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], The Netherlands.&lt;ref name="humboldt-foundation"/&gt;

In 1989 Stuart Parkin discovered the phenomenon of oscillatory interlayer coupling in magnetic multilayers, by which magnetic layers are magnetically coupled via an intervening non-magnetic metallic spacer layer.  Parkin found that the sign of the exchange coupling oscillates from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic with an oscillation period of just a few atomic layers. Remarkably, Parkin discovered this phenomenon in thin film magnetic heterostructures that he prepared in a simple home-made sputtering system. Parkin, moreover, showed that this phenomenon is displayed by almost all metalllic transition elements. In what is often referred to as "Parkin's Periodic Table", Parkin showed that the strength of this oscillatory interlayer exchange interaction varied systematically across the Periodic Table of the elements.  Parkin made numerous other fundamental discoveries which continued the development of the field of "spintronics" of which he is recognised as a prolific scientist.  

Later Parkin improved magnetic tunnelling junctions, a device invented in the 1970s by julliere, and revolutionized by Jagadeesh Moodera of MIT. This element can create a high performance magnetic random access memory in 1995.&lt;ref name="wired-millennium"/&gt; MRAM promises unique attributes of high speed, high density and non-volatility. The development by Parkin in 2001 of giant tunnelling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions using highly textured MgO tunnel barriers has made MRAM even more promising. IBM developed the first MRAM prototype in 1999 and is currently developing a 16 Mbit chip.

Most recently, Parkin has proposed and is working on a novel storage class memory device, The Magnetic [[Racetrack memory]], which could replace both hard disk drives and many forms of conventional solid state memory.&lt;ref name="ibm-research-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-millennium"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26929250|title=Hard disk pioneer Stuart Parkin wins Millennium Prize|publisher=BBC News|date=9 April 2014|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research interests also include spin transistors and spin-logic devices that may enable a new generation of low-power electronics.

Parkin's research interests include organic superconductors, high-temperature superconductors, and, most recently, magnetic thin film structures and spintronic materials and devices for advanced sensor, memory, and logic applications. He is a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], the [[American Physical Society]], the Materials Research Society, the Institute of Physics (London), the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], and the Gutenberg Research College (GRC).

Parkin has authored approximately 400 papers and has around 90 issued patents.&lt;ref name="ibm-research-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-stuart.parkin|title=Stuart S.P. Parkin|publisher=IBM Research|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the chief editor of Spin, one of [[World Scientific]]'s newest journals, which publishes articles in spin electronics.&lt;ref name="SPIN-chief-editor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/page/spin/editorial-board|title=Stuart Parkin, Chief Editor of Spin|publisher=World Scientific|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Parkin is the recipient of numerous honours, including the Gutenberg Research Award (2008), a [[Humboldt Prize|Humboldt Research Award]] (2004), the 1999–2000 [[American Institute of Physics]] Prize for Industrial Applications of Physics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/industry/prize/parkin|title=Stuart Parkin|publisher=American Institute of Physics|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Physical Society]]'s [[Europhysics Prize]] (1997), the American Physical Society's International New Materials Prize (1994), the MRS Outstanding Young Investigator Award (1991) and the Charles Vernon Boys Prize from the Institute of Physics, London (1991). In 2001, he was named the first "Innovator of the Year" by ''R&amp;D Magazine'' and in October 2007 was received the "No Boundaries" Award for Innovation from ''[[The Economist]]''.

In April 2014, Parkin was awarded the [[Millennium Technology Prize]] for his work on spintronic materials, "leading to a prodigious growth in the capacity to store digital information".&lt;ref name="MTPrize_TAF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MTPrize_theguardian"/&gt;

In March 2016, Parkin was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], Scotland's national academy of science and letters.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/1200_2016ElectedFellows.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2805">'''Undulation of the geoid''' is the height of the [[geoid]] relative to a given [[ellipsoid of reference]]. In maps and common use the height over the mean sea level (such as [[orthometric height]]) is used to indicate the height of elevations while the [[ellipsoidal height]] results from the [[GPS]] system. 

The process of the undulation is not standardised, as different countries use different mean sea levels as reference but most commonly refers to the [[EGM96]] geoid. Calculating the undulation factor is mathematically challenging. This is why many handheld GPS receivers have built-in undulation [[lookup table]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wormley|first1=Sam|title=GPS Orthometric Height|url=http://www.edu-observatory.org/gps/height.html|website=www.edu-observatory.org|accessdate=15 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620102914/http://www.edu-observatory.org/gps/height.html|archivedate=20 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the height above sea level.

The deviation &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; between the [[ellipsoidal height]] &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and the [[orthometric height]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by

:&lt;math&gt;N=h-H&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the deviation &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; between the ellipsoidal height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and the [[normal height]] &lt;math&gt;H_N&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta=h-H_N&lt;/math&gt;
Geoid undulations display uncertainties which can be estimated by using several methods, i.e. [[Least squares|least-squares]] collocation (LSC), [[fuzzy logic]], [[Artificial neural network|artificial neutral networks]], [[Radial basis function|radial basis functions]] (RBF), and [[Geostatistics|geostatistical]] techniques. Geostatistical approach has been defined as the most improved technique in prediction of geoid undulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chicaiza|first=E.G.|last2=Leiva|first2=C.A.|last3=Arranz|first3=J.J.|last4=Buenańo|first4=X.E.|date=2017-06-14|title=Spatial uncertainty of a geoid undulation model in Guayaquil, Ecuador|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/geo-2017-0021/geo-2017-0021.xml?format=INT|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=255-265|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0021|issn=2391-5447|via=|bibcode=2017OGeo....9...21C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wells turbine''' is a low-pressure [[Wind turbine|air turbine]] that rotates continuously in one direction independent of the direction of the air flow. Its blades feature a symmetrical [[airfoil]] with its plane of symmetry in the [[plane of rotation]] and perpendicular to the air stream.

It was developed for use in [[Oscillating Water Column]] [[wave power]] plants, in which a rising and falling water surface moving in an air compression chamber produces an oscillating air current.  The use of this bidirectional turbine avoids the need to rectify the air stream by delicate and expensive [[check valve]] systems.

Its efficiency is lower than that of a turbine with constant air stream direction and asymmetric airfoil. One reason for the lower efficiency is that symmetric airfoils have a higher [[drag coefficient]] than asymmetric ones, even under optimal conditions. Also, in the Wells turbine, the symmetric airfoil runs partly under high [[angle of attack]] (i.e., low blade speed / air speed ratio), which occurs during the air velocity maxima of the oscillating flow. A high angle of attack causes a condition known as "[[Stall (flight)|stall]]" in which the airfoil loses lift. The efficiency of the Wells turbine in oscillating flow reaches values between 0.4 and 0.7.

This simple but ingenious device was developed by Prof. [[Alan Arthur Wells]] of [[Queen's University Belfast]] in the late 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7077">'''William Heick''' (October 6, 1916 – September 13, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/marinij/obituary.aspx?pid=160781899#fbLoggedOut&lt;/ref&gt; was a San Francisco-based photographer and filmmaker. He is best known for his ethnographic photographs and documentary films of North American Indian cultures. W.R. Heick served as producer-director and chief cinematographer for the [http://ls.berkeley.edu/dept/anth/dept.html Anthropology Department] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] on their National Science Foundation supported American Indian Film Project. His photographs capture the life and culture of Native Americans from the [[Kwakiutl]], Kashaya [[Pomo people|Pomo]], [[Hupa]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Blackfoot]] and [[Sioux]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/10/30/EB86274.DTL&amp;type=printable&lt;/ref&gt; He filmed a number of award winning films in this series along with the documentaries ''Pomo Shaman'' and ''Sucking Doctor'', a Pomo doctoring ceremony considered by anthropologists to be one of the most complete and outstanding films of an aboriginal ceremony made to date.

== Art Photography ==

His fine art photography has been exhibited at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], the [[California Palace of the Legion of Honor]], the DeYoung Museum, the Seattle Museum of Art, the Henry Gallery (University of Washington), the [http://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu/ Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology], and the University Art Gallery (Cal State at Chico) among others. His photographs have been selected for the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the High Museum of Art, Atlanta, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, and the Monterey Peninsula Museum of Art.

In a published "Art Scene" review Monterey landscape artist and art critic Rick Deregon wrote: "The special qualities of W.R. Heicks's images come from the simple relationship between the photographer and subject. With no agenda other than to capture the decisive inspirational moment and to illustrate the human parade Mr. Heick's work transcends straight journalism and aspires to an art of nobility and compassion."

== Career ==

William Heick's career in photography began as a naval intelligence photographer during World War Two in the Pacific. After the war he studied photography at California School of Fine Arts (now the [[San Francisco Art Institute]]) under such notable teachers as [[Ansel Adams]] and [[Minor White]]. He became lifelong friends with [[Imogen Cunningham]] and [[Dorothea Lange]] and regards these two photographers as the primary influences on his photographic work.

William Heick filmed two documentaries about Pacific Northwest Indian tribes, ''[[Blunden Harbour]]'' (1951) and ''[[Dances of the Kwakiutl]]'' (1951).

W.R. Heick worked through most of the 1950s and 1960s as producer-director, assistant historian and cinematographer for the worldwide engineering firm of [[Bechtel]] Corporation. While with Bechtel he wrote and filmed documentaries of their major projects with special emphasis on ethnic and social consideration in remote areas of the Arctic, South America, Africa, Greenland, Europe, The Middle East, Australia, Indonesia and the islands of New Guinea and Bougainville. From 1956 to 1964 Heick was involved with [[C. Cameron Macauley]] in the [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/10/30/EB86274.DTL&amp;type=printable American Indian Film Project], a project to document [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American culture]]s through film and sound recordings, working closely with [[Alfred Kroeber]] and [[Samuel Barrett]].

William Heick produced two documentaries for the [[Quakers]]. ''Beauty for Ashes'' documents the Quaker's project to rebuild 40 churches that had been burned by nightriders during Mississippi's racial strife in the turbulent 1960s. ''Voyage of the Phoenix'' documents the controversial voyage of the yacht ''[[Phoenix of Hiroshima|Phoenix]],'' which sailed through the American battle fleet during the [[Vietnam War]] to deliver medical supplies to North Vietnam when the bombing of that beleaguered country was at its peak.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s W.R. Heick served as cinematographer on three feature films, all for the director/artist [[Fredric Hobbs]]: ''Troika'' (1969, co-directed by Gordon Mueller), ''Alabama's Ghost'' (1973), and ''The Godmonster of Indian Flat'' (1973).

During the mid-1970s, working as an independent producer with Gordon Mueller, W.R. Heick produced the ''Indonesian Dance Series.'' This series, funded with grants from Caltex Pacific Indonesia and [[Pertamina]], documents fourteen traditional dance performances from the islands of [[Java]], [[Bali]], [[Sumatra]] and [[Kalimantan]].

W.R. Heick's later films include ''The Other China'', a four-part mini-series filmed on location in [[Taiwan]] in 1988 documenting the social and cultural fabric of Taiwan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4846">The '''Xputer''' is a design for a [[Reconfigurable computing|reconfigurable computer]], proposed by computer scientist Reiner Hartenstein. Hartenstein uses various terms to describe the various innovations in the design, including config-ware, flow-ware, morph-ware, and "anti-machine".

The Xputer represents a move away from the traditional [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] computer architecture, to a coarse-grained "soft [[Arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU)" architecture.&lt;ref name="b1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=692qqDaB1UwC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=rDPA+reconfigurable+datapath+array&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d1L75vdLZ6&amp;sig=6l1pGDN9QC8aBIk0-HLJrEkVe6s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=rDPA%20reconfigurable%20datapath%20array&amp;f=false Field-Programmable Logic: Architectures, Synthesis and Applications], Reiner W.

==Architecture ==
The Xputer architecture is data-stream-based, and is the counterpart of the [[Instruction set|instruction]]-based von Neumann computer architecture.

The Xputer architecture was one of the first coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures,&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt; and consists of a reconfigurable datapath array (rDPA) organized as a two-dimensional array of ALUs (rDPU).&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt; The bus-width between ALU's were 32-bit in the first version of the Xputer.&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt;

The ALUs (also known as rDPUs) are used for computing a single mathematical operation, such as addition, subtraction or multiplication, and can also be used purely for routing.&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt;

ALUs are mesh-connected via three types of connections, and data-flow along these connections are managed by an address generation unit.&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt;
*Nearest neighbour (connections between neighbouring ALUs)
*Row/column back-buses
*Global bus (a single global bus for interconnection between further ALUs)

Programs for the Xputer are written in the [[C (programming language)|C]] language, and compiled for usage on the Xputer using the CoDeX compiler written by the author.&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt; The CoDeX compiler maps suitable portions of the C program onto the Xputer's rDPA fabric.&lt;ref name="b2"/&gt; The remainder of the program is executed on the host system, such as a [[personal computer]].

==rDPA==
A '''reconfigurable datapath array''' (rDPA) is a [[semiconductor]] device containing reconfigurable data path units and programmable interconnects, first proposed by Rainer Kress in 1993, at the [[University of Kaiserslautern]].

Instead of [[FPGA]]s ([[field-programmable gate array]]s) having single bit configurable logic blocks (CLBs), rDPAs have multiple bits wide (for instance, 32 bit path width) reconfigurable datapath units (rDPUs).

Each rDPU can be configured to perform an individual function. These rDPUs and interconnects can be programmed after the manufacturing process by the customer/designer (hence the term "reconfigurable") so that the rDPA can perform whatever complex computation is needed. Because rDPUs are multiple bits wide (for instance, 32 bits), we talk about coarse-grained reconfigurability - in contrast to [[FPGA]]s with single-bit wide configurable logic blocks, called fine-gained reconfigurable.

rDPAs are structurally programmed from "config-ware" [[source code]], compiled into pipe-networks to be mapped onto the rDPA. rDPAs are not instruction-stream-driven and have no instruction fetch at run time. rDPUs do not have a program counter.&lt;ref name="b3"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DK5Z1j8SpAgC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=rDPA+reconfigurable+datapath+array&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JRpKhpR5_8&amp;sig=ICJU9NZRxVKFhbldpcrPHGh3tvU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=rDPA%20reconfigurable%20datapath%20array&amp;f=false Reconfigurable System Design and Verification], CRC Press, 17-Feb-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
