'''[[Albanians]]''' ({{lang-bg|албанци}}, ''albantsi'') are a minority [[ethnic group]] '''in [[Bulgaria]]''' ({{lang-sq|Bullgaria}}). Although according to the 2001 census they only numbered 278,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccedi.government.bg/save_pdf.php?id=247 |title=Етнически малцинствени общности |publisher=Национален съвет за сътрудничество по етническите и демографските въпроси |accessdate=2007-02-18 |language=Bulgarian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322131240/http://www.nccedi.government.bg/save_pdf.php?id=247 |archivedate=2013-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; their number in the Bulgarian lands was much larger in the past. Between the 15th and 17th century, groups of Albanians (both [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] by confession) settled in many parts of modern [[northern Bulgaria]], with a less numerous group of settlers in southern [[Thrace]].

==History==

===Catholic settlers===
Some of the earliest Albanian settlers in modern Bulgaria were the Roman Catholic ore miners in [[Kopilovtsi, Montana Province]], a village in the vicinity of the larger mining centre [[Chiprovtsi]]. Kopilovtsi was settled between the 15th and the 17th century; a Catholic church was built in the early 17th century. Unlike the Catholic population in other villages of the region, Kopilovtsi's residents were of Albanian origin. In 1626, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Archbishop of Bar]] [[Pjetër Mazreku]] claims that part of the Bulgarian Catholics are Albanians (''Albanesi''), [[Saxons]] and [[Paulicians]]. According to Bulgarian bishop [[Petar Bogdan]], Kopilovtsi had 1,200 Catholics of Albanian origin who were still speaking the [[Albanian language]] in 1640. In another report from 1647, Petar Bogdan also lists 1,200 Albanian Catholics in Kopilovtsi, but notes that they have started using [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] instead. By 1658, Petar Bogdan notes that the over 1,500 Albanians in Kopilovtsi spoke Bulgarian and only retained some traces of their original language. Kopilovtsi, along with Chiprovtsi, was depopulated with the crushing of the [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] in 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Гюзелев, pp. 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodox settlers===
Albanian settlement in northern Bulgaria was not limited to Catholics—in a 1595 letter to the [[Prince of Transylvania]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] merchant Pavel Đorđić notes that "in Bulgaria there are many villages inhabited by Albanians, from where 7,000 brave and well-trained men can be rallied". In the same letter, Đorđić claims that 1,500 of those Albanians lived near [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]].&lt;ref&gt;Гюзелев, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, the [[toponym]] [[Arbanasi, Bulgaria|Arbanasi]], a village near the city of Tarnovo, is a hint at Albanian settlement in the region. Arbanasi was populated (or repopulated) in the late 15th century and as an administratively autonomous village in the [[Ottoman Empire]] attracted many settlers. It is theorized that the first settlers were around 100–200 Albanians who were brought there during [[Bayezid II]]'s campaigns in Albania. These settlers were gradually Hellenized and Bulgarianized in the following centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Гюзелев, pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other places in northern Bulgaria where an Albanian presence has been strongly suggested are [[Chervena Voda]] near [[Rousse]], [[Poroishte]] near [[Razgrad]], [[Dobrina]] near [[Provadia]] and [[Devnya]] near [[Varna]].&lt;ref&gt;Гюзелев, pp. 57–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Albanians have been registered in the modern Bulgarian capital [[Sofia]] since the early 17th century; other possible colonies south of the [[Balkan Mountains]] included [[Gorno Arbanasi]] and [[Dolno Arbanasi]] near [[Asenovgrad]].&lt;ref&gt;Гюзелев, pp. 97–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable Albanian village in [[Upper Thracian Plain|Bulgarian Thrace]] is [[Mandritsa]] near [[Ivaylovgrad]], which was settled in the first half of the 17th century by settlers from near [[Korçë]]. A church was built in 1718.&lt;ref&gt;Гюзелев, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; The village reached its demographic peak before the [[Balkan Wars]]; in 1912, it was inhabited by 1,879 people.&lt;ref&gt;Милетич, Л. Разорението на тракийските българи през 1913 г. София, 1918, с. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Liberation activities===
After the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule in 1878, many Albanians arrived to the country as political immigrants. A patriotic organization of Albanians in Bulgaria, ''Longing'', was established on 1 January 1893 in Sofia and initially had 53 members. An Albanian-language printing press was founded shortly thereafter; besides calendars and newspapers, the printing house published important patriotic works of the [[National Renaissance of Albania]], including publications by brothers [[Naim Frashëri]] and [[Sami Frashëri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promacedonia.org/bugarash/albvbg.html|title=Албанците в България|last=Бобев|first=Боби|author2=Тома Кацори|year=1998|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2009-05-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090524182740/http://promacedonia.org/bugarash/albvbg.html| archivedate= 24 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the text of the Albanian [[national anthem]], [[Aleksander Stavre Drenova]]'s ''[[Himni i Flamurit|Hymn to the Flag]]'', was first published in Sofia by the ''Freedom of Albania'' newspaper.

==Notable People==

===Politics===
*[[Rıza Tevfik Bölükbaşı]]  –  Turkish philosopher, poet, politician of liberal signature and a community leader
* [[Vasile Lupu]]  -  Voivode of Moldavia between 1634 and 1653.

'''Khan Bahadur Allah Bakhsh Gabol''' ({{lang-ur|''' خان بهادرالله بخش گبول '''}}) (15 August 1895 – December 1972) was a political leader of the 20th century and an exponent of the [[Pakistan]] Movement from [[Sindh]] [http://www.dawn.com/2007/08/27/fea.htm]. He owned a considerable portion of land in Karachi, including the area of Lea Market and the stretch of land where Safoora Goth, Abdullah Gabol Goth, Chutta Khan Goth and Gadap now exist. He also possessed the land where [[Gabol Town]] and [[Jinnah International Airport]] are now located. Allah Bakhsh Gabol was the son of a landlord Khudadad Khan Gabol, and the grandfather of [[Nabil Gabol]][https://web.archive.org/web/20080322231430/http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=40902].

== Political life ==
Gabol was the first Deputy Speaker of the [[Sindh Assembly]], after the imposition of Government of [[India]] Act 1935 [https://web.archive.org/web/20080430182140/http://www.pap.gov.pk/pro-ass/sindh.htm]. He defeated Haji Sir Abdullah Haroon in 1937 in the first election after [[Sindh]] was separated from Bombay. He was also twice elected the Mayor of the then [[Karachi]] Municipal Corporation in 1953 and 1962. It is now the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation. [http://www.dawn.com/2006/07/24/top10.htm]. Due to his outstanding status, he was awarded the title of Khan Bahadur by the [[British Empire]] and after the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, he was awarded the Sitara i Imtiaz by President Ayub Khan in 1966. Thus he was considered to be an influential politician of Karachi of his times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sindhudesh.com/gmsyed/case/saeen-book1-part1.htm |title=The Case of Sindh – G.M.

==Baloch League==
Karachi is not only the cradle of the modern [[Baloch people|Balochi]] literary movement, but also the centre to uphold the modern Baloch political trends. Simultaneous with formation of the [[Anjuman Khudam-ul-Quran|Anjuman]], the Baloch literary class in Karachi formed a nationalist organisation, called the Baloch League. Gholam Mohammad Noor ud-Din, educated from [[Bombay]], was appointed as its president. The other members of its leadership were: Waja Omar Bakhsh Sabera, a famous merchant, Maolavi Mohammad Osman, Mehrab Khan, Issa Khan, Maolavi Abdul Samad Sarbazi, Khan Sahib Osman, Pir Bakhsh Shahdad and Gabol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balochistaninfo.com/200604/BalochNationalismitsOriginandDevelopment.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008130816/http://www.balochistaninfo.com/200604/BalochNationalismitsOriginandDevelopment.pdf |archivedate=8 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its annual conference in 1930 the League condemned Magasi's imprisonment and openly demanded his immediate release from the British authorities. In the late 1930s, after his graduation from Aligarh University, the nationalist leader, [[Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo]] also joined the League.

[[Image:VeganSociety.jpg|right|frame|The logo of the [[Vegan Society]] (UK), which associated international groups of such (similar) societies based on veganism.]]

The '''American Vegan Society''' ('''AVS''') is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]] that promotes [[veganism]] in the [[United States]].

AVS was founded by 1960 by [[H. Jay Dinshah]].  The date of the earlier [[The Vegan Society|The Vegan Society (UK)]]'s founding, November 1, is now celebrated annually as [[World Vegan Day]].

== Activities ==
* Operation of a website
* Publishes '''''American Vegan''''' quarterly magazine, which is sent to members of the society (earlier issues are published on the website) 
* Bookstore (hundreds of new and classic [[vegan]] books for sale)
* Book publishing explaining and supporting veganism (since 1964)
* Video production; YouTube channels: "Powerful Vegan Messages" and "American Vegan Society"
* AVS Speakers Bureau (18 popular vegan speakers from throughout the United States)
* Vegan conferences (the first annual event was held in 1960; bylaws require an annual vegan conference)
* Cooking classes (conducting vegan cooking classes directly; resource and consultant for others to conduct their own vegan cooking classes for adults, youth, and young children)
* Gourmet vegan dinners by culinary students, encouraging culinary students to learn vegan cooking by hosting events with only vegan food.  
** American Vegan Society consults with the chef-educators, markets the event, and provides the diners for the event.  Currently this is four AVS-coordinated and hosted events each year; the template for these events is used increasingly throughout America.
* Outreach at public events (vegan books, vegan literature, and speaking about veganism)
* Other support for direct inquiries, consulting for vegan community outreach
* Collects, aggregates, and publishes a comprehensive list of vegan-oriented VegFests around the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanvegan.org/vegfests.htm VegFests in the USA]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other events

Prior to broad and widely-accessible search capabilities of the Internet, the American Vegan Society published networking and business resources which supported vegan lifestyle.

==History==
[[H. Jay Dinshah]] founded the American Vegan Society  early in 1960 and later that year (August) married the English-born Freya Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|journal=American Vegan|date=Fall 2013|volume=13|issue=3|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freya, whose parents were active in [[The Vegan Society]] (of England), contributed to the early growth of the American Vegan Society and is president of the American Vegan Society today. The American Vegan Society is headquartered at Malaga, New Jersey, on a parcel of land which is called "SunCrest", or "the SunCrest Educreational Center." During Dinshah's life, the American Vegan Society was characterized by vegan publishing and outreach, annual vegan conferences, vegan archiving, spiritual inspiration, providing people with an experience of vegan living, vegan food-preparation demonstrations, maintenance of a small veganic garden, and extensive networking.  Dinshah served the American Vegan Society as its president and as editor of its publication, Ahimsa magazine (1960–2000).
 
Ahimsa was a quarterly publication that explored compassionate living ("Ahimsa" meaning "dynamic harmlessness") as a philosophy, practical aspects of vegan living, and personal and cultural resources for vegans. Ahimsa included vegan menus and recipes, and news about food. The American Vegan Society continues to publish a quarterly periodical, now titled American Vegan, with the motto "Ahimsa lights the way." The American Vegan Society is now led and managed by its president, Freya Dinshah and advised by the AVS Council of Trustees, all of whom are vegans, and operated by a team of staff and volunteers.
 
The American Vegan Society "promotes, supports, and explores a compassionate, healthful, and sustainable lifestyle. The diet is plant-sourced, varied, and abundant. For ethical, health, environmental, and other reasons, (vegans) reject all animal products in food, clothing, and commodities, and the exploitation of animals for sport or entertainment. AVS is guided by the doctrines of Ahimsa (non-slaughter, non-violence) and Reverence for Life, and provides community and friendship to those following and learning about this way of living."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|journal=American Vegan|date=Fall 2013|volume=13|issue=3|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--moved from [[H. Jay Dinshah]]--&gt;Donald Watson in England (and possibly others) coined the term 'vegan' in 1944; it referred to an entirely plant-based diet (with or without spiritual or philosophical or ethical underpinnings).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2005/12/08/17887541.php Obituary of Donald Watson, who died at 95, by Karen Dawn, Thursday Dec 8th, 2005 6:50 PM]&lt;/ref&gt; American Vegan Society used the term vegan to mean dynamic harmlessness and successfully developed a broad social base of practicing vegans who  committed themselves to that meaning and practice.

Catherine Nimmo and Rubin Abramowitz formed a vegan society in California (1948 to 1960), and they both joined the American Vegan Society when Dinshah founded it in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanvegan.org/history.htm |title=History of American Vegan Society |access-date=2014-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827105211/http://www.americanvegan.org/history.htm |archive-date=2014-08-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1965 - the American Vegan Society organized and carried out North Atlantic Lecture Tour (Iceland, Britain, Europe).

==American Vegan Society conventions==
Annual Conferences were held since 1960.

Alternate conferences and conventions were held, largely in the northeastern US (New Jersey and New York) but also earlier in California, then later in California (Arcata), Colorado (Denver), Oregon (Portland), and Washington (Olympia), often sharing logistical responsibilities with local and regional vegetarian societies. For a number of years, beginning in 1989, convention proceedings were videotaped.

The Dinshahs conducted weekend workshops, cooking classes, and other educational programs at SunCrest in Malaga, as early as 1969, when their first building (headquarters) was donated.

In 1995, the AVS cohosted the 8th International Vegan Festival in San Diego California, with VUNA (Vegetarian Union of North America) and Vegans International (VI).

'''Bancorex''' was the largest bank in Romania during the 1990s, accounting for more than a fourth of the banking market share when it was closed down in 1999.&lt;ref name="sherif87"&gt;Sherif, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; The bank failed due to [[non-performing loan]]s that were related to political corruption, especially behind-the-scenes political dealings.&lt;ref name="sherif87"/&gt; The bank was [[bailout|bailed out]] by the Romanian state, its good assets being then merged with the more solvent [[Banca Comercială Română]].

It was founded as the ''Banca Română de Comerț Exterior'' ("Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade") in 1968 and for decades it was the bank through which much of Romania's foreign trade was conducted.

==Bailout and merger==

Toward the end of 1997, Bancorex received a sum of $600 million from the government, representing 2% of Romania's GDP. The [[recapitalization]] was followed by a management change in April 1998, but not by a restructuring, and the situation of the bank further deteriorated.&lt;ref name="sherif87"/&gt; It was only in late 1998, when a crisis hit Bancorex again, that the government considered restructuring the bank, eyeing a [[privatization]] procedure.&lt;ref name="sherif87"/&gt;

By 1999, it became clear that a recapitalization of the bank would require [[United States dollar|$]]2 billion (almost 6% of Romania's GDP), which couldn't have been afforded by the government.&lt;ref name="sherif87"/&gt; A February 1999 estimate said that $1.7 billion (or 85-90% of its loan portfolio), much of it in foreign currency, was non-performing.&lt;ref name="sherif87"/&gt; This sum represented 5% of Romania's GDP at the time.&lt;ref name="sherif87"/&gt;

In April 1999, Bancorex collapsed as depositors lined up to get their savings out of the bank.&lt;ref name="sherif88"&gt;Sherif, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent further [[bank run]]s, the Romanian authorities decided upon a fast [[liquidation]], transferring bad assets to a newly created Asset Recovery Agency, while deposits and most of the structure of Bancorex were absorbed by another state-owned bank, Banca Comercială Română.&lt;ref name="sherif88"/&gt; The banking license was withdrawn on July 31, 1999, effective August 2, 1999.&lt;ref name="sherif88"/&gt; The Romanian government compensated Banca Comercială Română for the liabilities transferred from Bancorex and it gave the right to refuse any assets of Bancorex.&lt;ref name="sherif88"/&gt;

==Cost of the bailout==

In 1999, the government took into [[public debt]] from Bancorex a sum of $1.5 billion, or 4.5% of GDP, in addition to the 1997 recapitalization of $600 million and the assumption of some [[off-balance-sheet]] items and [[Legal liability|legal liabilities]] that have not been disclosed.&lt;ref name="sherif88"/&gt;

'''Business''' is the activity of making one's living or making [[money]] by producing or buying and selling [[Product (business)|products]] (such as [[goods and services]]).&lt;ref&gt; Compare: [https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=business American Heritage Dictionary] "business [:] 1. The activity of buying and selling [[commodity | commodities]], products, or services".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Longman Business English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/business Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English] "business [:] 1 [...] the activity of making money by producing or buying and selling goods, or providing services".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/business Oxford Living Dictionaries] "business [:] 2 The practice of making one's living by engaging in [[commerce]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, it is "any activity or enterprise entered into for profit. It does not mean it is a company, a corporation, partnership, or have any such formal organization, but it can range from a street peddler to General Motors."&lt;ref&gt;''Burton's Legal Thesaurus'', 4E. S.v. "business." Retrieved April 1, 2018 from https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/business&lt;/ref&gt; 

Having a [[business name]] does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business.  If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions.  A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.

The term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a [[company]]. A company, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for [[limited liability]], as well as [[corporate tax]] rates.  A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.

== Forms ==
{{Main|List of business entities}}

Forms of business ownership vary by [[jurisdiction]], but several common entities exist:

* '''Sole proprietorship:''' A [[sole proprietorship]], also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire [[employees]]. A sole proprietor has unlimited [[legal liability|liability]] for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from [[operating cost]]s or [[judgment]]s against the business. All [[asset]]s of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, computer infrastructure, any [[inventory]], [[manufacturing]] equipment, or [[retail]] [[Fixture (property law)|fixtures]], as well as any [[real property]] owned by the sole proprietor.
* '''Partnership:'''  A [[partnership]] is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are [[general partnership]]s, [[limited partnership]]s, and [[limited liability partnership]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Journal|doi=10.5465/amj.2013.0581 |title=Friends and Profits Don't Mix: The Performance Implications of Repeated Partnerships |journal=Academy of Management Journal |volume=59 |issue=2 |page=460 |year=2014 |last1=Holloway |first1=S. S. |last2=Parmigiani |first2=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Corporation:'''  The owners of a [[corporation]] have [[limited liability]] and the business has a separate [[legal personality]] from its owners.  Corporations can be either [[State-owned enterprise|government-owned]] or privately owned, and they can organize either for profit or as [[nonprofit organization]]s. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its [[shareholder]]s, who elect a [[board of directors]] to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff.  A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either [[privately held company|privately held]] by a small group of individuals, or [[public company|publicly held]], with publicly traded [[Share (finance)|shares]] listed on a [[stock exchange]].
* '''Cooperative:''' Often referred to as a "co-op", a [[cooperative]] is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either [[Consumers' co-operative|consumer cooperatives]] or [[worker cooperative]]s. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of [[economic democracy]].
* [[Limited liability company|Limited liability companies (LLC)]], limited liability partnerships, and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from [[business failure]] by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/choose-your-business-structure US Small Business Administration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://smallbusinesschamberofcommerce.blogspot.com/ Small Business Chamber of Commerce, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Franchises:''' A [[franchising|franchise]] is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smallbusiness.chron.com/definition-franchise-business-4467.html Definition of a Franchise Business]&lt;/ref&gt;  Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse.  One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.&lt;ref&gt;h{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/1046669X.2011.533109|title=A Comparison of Retail Franchises, Independent Businesses, and Purchased Existing Independent Business Startups: Lessons from the Kauffman Firm Survey|journal=Journal of Marketing Channels|volume=18|page=3|year=2011|last1=Welsh|first1=Dianne H. B.|last2=Desplaces|first2=David E.|last3=Davis|first3=fAmy E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''A [[Private company limited by guarantee|company limited by guarantee]]:'''  Commonly used where companies are formed for noncommercial purposes, such as clubs or charities.  The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into [[Liquidation|insolvent liquidation]], but otherwise, they have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of company is common in [[England]]. A company limited by guarantee may be with or without having [[share capital]].
* '''A [[Private company limited by shares|company limited by shares]]:'''  The most common form of the company used for business ventures. Specifically, a limited company is a "company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested" with corporations being "the most common example of a limited company."&lt;ref name="Black's"&gt;Black's Law and lee Dictionary. Second Pocket Edition. Bryan A. Garner, editor. West. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of company is common in [[England]] and many English-speaking countries. A company limited by shares may be a
** [[Public company|publicly traded company]] or a
** [[privately held company]]
* '''A company limited by guarantee with a share capital:'''  A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for noncommercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return.  This type of company may no longer be formed in the UK, although provisions still exist in law for them to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Act 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''A [[limited liability company]]:''' "A company—statutorily authorized in certain states—that is characterized by limited liability, management by members or managers, and limitations on ownership transfer", i.e., L.L.C.&lt;ref name="Black's" /&gt; LLC structure has been called "hybrid" in that it "combines the characteristics of a corporation and of a partnership or sole proprietorship". Like a corporation, it has limited liability for members of the company, and like a partnership it has "flow-through taxation to the members" and must be "dissolved upon the death or bankruptcy of a member".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp#ixzz2CEzgE239|title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) Definition - Investopedia|author=root|work=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''An [[unlimited company]] with or without a share capital:''' A hybrid entity, a company where the liability of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited. In this case doctrine of a veil of incorporation does not apply.
''Less common types of companies are:''
* '''Companies formed by letters patent:'''  Most corporations by letters patent are ''[[Corporation sole|corporations sole]]'' and not companies as the term is commonly understood today.
* '''[[Royal charter|Charter corporations]]:'''  Before the passing of modern companies legislation, these were the only types of companies.  Now they are relatively rare, except for very old companies that still survive (of which there are still many, particularly many British banks), or modern societies that fulfill a quasi-regulatory function (for example, the [[Bank of England]] is a corporation formed by a modern charter).
* '''Statutory companies:'''  Relatively rare today, certain companies have been formed by a private statute passed in the relevant jurisdiction.
Note that "Ltd after the company's name signifies limited company, and PLC ([[public limited company]]) indicates that its shares are widely held."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plc.asp|title=Investopedia - Public Limited Company|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the "members". In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the [[shareholder]]s. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some [[Offshore financial center|offshore jurisdictions]] have created special forms of [[offshore company]] in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include "[[Segregated portfolio company|segregated portfolio companies]]" and restricted purpose companies.

There are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.

Companies are also sometimes distinguished for legal and regulatory purposes between '''[[Public limited company|public companies]]''' and '''[[Privately held company|private companies]]'''. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a [[stock exchange]] which imposes [[Listing (finance)|listing requirements]]/[[Listing Rules]] as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of an exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.

A [[parent company]] is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company. The definition of a parent company differs by jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.

== Activities ==
=== Accounting ===
{{Main|Accounting}}
Accounting is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about [[economic entity|economic entities]]&lt;ref name = "NP 2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Needles |first1=Belverd E. |last2=Powers |first2=Marian |year=2013 |title=Principles of Financial Accounting |publisher=Cengage Learning |edition=12 |series=Financial Accounting Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=November 1940 |title=Accounting Research Bulletins No. 7 Reports of Committee on Terminology |url=http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/deloitte/id/9342 |publisher=Committee on Accounting Procedure, American Institute of Accountants |accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as businesses and [[corporation]]s. The modern field was established by the [[Italians|Italian]] mathematician [[Luca Pacioli]] in 1494.&lt;ref name=jkdiwan&gt;{{cite book|last=DIWAN|first=Jaswith|title=ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS &amp; THEORIES|publisher=MORRE|location=LONDON|id=id# 94452|pages=001–002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accounting, which has been called the "language of business",&lt;ref name="wharton-language"&gt;{{Citation | url =http://kwhs.wharton.upenn.edu/2013/09/peggy-bishop-lane-on-why-accounting-is-the-language-of-business/ | title =Peggy Bishop Lane on Why Accounting Is the Language of Business | publisher =Knowledge @ Wharton High School | date =September 23, 2013 | accessdate =25 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including [[investor]]s, [[creditor]]s, [[management]], and [[Regulatory agency|regulators]].&lt;ref name = "UW Dept"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foster.washington.edu/academic/departments/accounting/Pages/accounting.aspx |title=Department of Accounting |year=2013 |website=Foster School of Business |publisher=Foster School of Business |accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners of accounting are known as [[accountant]]s. The terms "accounting" and "financial reporting" are often used as synonyms.

=== Finance ===
{{Main|Finance}}
Finance is a field that deals with the study of [[investments]]. It includes the dynamics of [[asset]]s and [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected [[rate of return]]. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: [[public finance]], [[corporate finance]] and [[personal finance]].

=== Manufacturing ===
{{Main|Manufacturing}}
[[Manufacturing]] is the production of [[merchandise]] for use or sale using labour and [[machine]]s, [[tool]]s, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from [[handicraft]] to [[High tech manufacturing|high tech]], but is most commonly applied to [[Industry|industrial]] production, in which [[raw material]]s are transformed into [[finished good]]s on a large scale.

=== Marketing ===
{{Main|Marketing}}
Marketing is defined by the [[American Marketing Association]] as ''"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."''&lt;ref&gt;Marketing definition approved in October 2007 by the [[American Marketing Association]]: [http://www.marketingpower.com/AboutAMA/Pages/DefinitionofMarketing.aspx].&lt;/ref&gt; The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services.  Marketing tactics include [[advertising]] as well as determining product [[pricing]].

With the rise in technology, marketing is further divided into a class called [[digital marketing]]. It is marketing products and services using digital technologies.

=== Research and development ===
{{Main|Research and development}}
Research and development refer to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitute the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage since the defining feature of the research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

=== Safety ===
{{Main|Safety}}
Safety is a key business concept that is defined by [[Merriam-Webster]] as “the condition of being safe from undergoing or causing hurt, injury, or loss”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/safety Definition of "safety"], [[Merriam-Webster]], updated February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Injuries cost businesses billions of dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, J. (2011). Economic Burden of Occupational Injury and Illness in the United States. Milbank Quarterly, 89(4), 728-772. DOI: 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2011.00648.x&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown how company acceptance and implementation of comprehensive safety and health management systems reduces incidents, insurance costs and workers’ compensation claims.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Kelly P. (2007). OSHA and small businesses: A winning combination: When small businesses tap into OSHA's many resources, everyone benefits. Occupational Hazards, 69(3), 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  New technologies, like wearable safety devices&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, S. (2016). Business Technical: Wearable Devices at Work. Business Insurance, 50(2), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and available online safety training, continue to be developed to encourage employers to invest in protection beyond the "[[:wikt:canary in a coal mine|canary in the coalmine]]" and reduce the cost to businesses of protecting their employees.

=== Sales ===
{{Main|Sales}}
Sales are activity related to selling or the amount of goods or services sold in a given time period. Sales are often integrated with all lines of business and are key to a companies' success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How To Organize Your Marketing Department In The Digital Age |url=https://www.cmo.com/features/articles/2015/2/12/organizing-for-digital-cwtk.html#gs.ZPr_RZ8 |accessdate=October 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
{{Main|Management}}
{{See also|Outline of business management}}
The efficient and effective [[Business operations|operation of a business]], and study of this subject, is called [[management]]. The major branches of management are [[finance|financial management]], [[marketing]] management, [[organizational studies|human resource management]], [[strategic management]], [[manufacturing|production management]], [[operations management]], [[service management]], and [[information technology management]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Owners may manage their businesses themselves, or employ managers to do so for them. Whether they are owners or employees, managers administer three primary components of the business' value: financial resources, capital (tangible resources), and human resources.  These resources are administered in at least six functional areas: legal contracting, manufacturing or service production, marketing, accounting, financing, and human resources.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Restructuring state enterprises ===
In recent decades, states modeled some of their [[asset]]s and enterprises after business enterprises. In 2003, for example, the [[People's Republic of China]] modeled 80% of its [[state-owned enterprise]]s on a company-type management system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/data/China_in_brief/Economy/Major%20Industries.html Major Industries]. People.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets.

Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of clients. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can, therefore, be described as a "process optimization process". It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, effective and capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach.{{who|date=October 2013}} &lt;!-- also what does this have to do with state enterprises? --&gt;

== Organization and regulation ==
{{See also|Theory of the firm}}
Most legal [[jurisdiction]]s specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of [[commercial law]] for each type.

The major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:

* '''The size and scope of the business firm''' and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the [[theory of the firm]]. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a [[stock market]] or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.
* '''The sector and country.''' Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.
* '''[[Tax advantage]]s.''' Different structures are treated differently in tax law and may have advantages for this reason.
* '''Disclosure and compliance requirements'''. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities) and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.

Many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of [[shareholder]]s, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from [[Legal liability|personal liability]] for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate "person". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.

Where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a ''sole proprietor'', whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.

A few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:

# General partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.
# Generally, corporations are required to pay tax just like "real" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called [[double taxation]], because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.
# In most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.
# "Going public" through a process known as an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public [[Limited liability company|LLC's]] that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, [[real estate investment trust]]s in the USA, and [[unit trust]]s in the UK. A general partnership cannot "go public".

=== Commercial law ===
{{Main|Corporate law}}
[[File:Downtownplazala.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Office]]s in the [[Los Angeles]] Downtown Financial District]]
A very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The [[Code of Hammurabi]] dates back to about 1772 BC for example, and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to [[Freight transport|shipping]] costs and dealings between merchants and [[broker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/assyria/hammurabi.html|title=Law Code of Hammurabi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "corporation" derives from the Latin ''corpus'', meaning body, and the [[Maurya Empire]] in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/cbl/Khanna_Ancient_India_informal.pdf |title=The Economic History of the Corporate Form in Ancient India |author=Vikramaditya S. Khanna |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019095432/http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/cbl/Khanna_Ancient_India_informal.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern treatment of labour and employee relations, [[Health and Safety Executive|worker protection and safety]], discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage,  as well as [[Trade union|unions]], worker compensation, and working hours and leave.

Some specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.

Some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, [[Public utility|public utilities]], investment securities, banking, insurance, [[broadcasting]], [[aviation]], and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.

=== Capital ===
[[File:Bolsa Mexicana de Valores.png|thumb|left|[[Mexican Stock Exchange]] in [[Paseo de la Reforma]], Mexico City]] When businesses need to raise money (called [[Capital (economics)|capital]]), they sometimes offer [[Security (finance)|securities]] for sale.

Capital may be raised through private means, by an [[initial public offering]] or IPO on a [[stock exchange]], or in other ways.

Major stock exchanges include the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]], [[Singapore Exchange]], [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]], [[New York Stock Exchange]] and [[NASDAQ]] (the USA), the [[London Stock Exchange]] (UK), the [[Tokyo Stock Exchange]] (Japan), and [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.

Businesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulatory authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).

The proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.

Other types of capital sourcing include crowdsourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.

=== Intellectual property ===
{{Main|Intellectual property}}
Businesses often have important "[[intellectual property]]" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, [[trademark]]s, or preservation of [[trade secret]]s. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international [[treaty|treaties]] concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign noncompete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.

=== Trade union ===
{{Main|Trade union}}
A trade union (or labor union) is an [[Political organisation#Labour unions|organization of workers]] who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better [[working conditions]]. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members ([[wikt: rank and file|rank and file]] members) and negotiates [[Labour and employment law|labor contracts]] ([[collective bargaining]]) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is "maintaining or improving the conditions of their [[employment]]".&lt;ref name="Webb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Webb |first=Sidney |last2=Webb|first2= Beatrice |title=History of Trade Unionism |publisher=Longmans and Co. London |year=1920}} ch. I&lt;/ref&gt; This may include the negotiation of [[wage]]s, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing, and promotion of workers, benefits, [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] and policies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23918">The '''[[crown land]]s''', '''crown estate''', '''royal domain''' or (in [[French language|French]]) '''''domaine royal''''' (from [[demesne]]) of France refers to the lands, [[fief]]s and rights directly possessed by the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Hallam, 79 and 247.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the term eventually came to refer to a territorial unit, the royal domain originally referred to the network of "castles, villages and estates, forests, towns, religious houses and bishoprics, and the rights of justice, tolls and taxes" effectively held by the king or under his domination.&lt;ref&gt;Hallam, 80-82.&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of territory, before the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], the ''domaine royal'' did not encompass the entirety of the [[Territorial formation of France|territory of the kingdom of France]] and for much of the Middle Ages significant portions of the kingdom were the direct possessions of other feudal lords.

In the tenth and eleventh centuries, the first Capetians—while being the kings of France—were among the least powerful of the great feudal lords of France in terms of territory possessed.  Patiently, through the use of feudal law (and, in particular, the confiscation of fiefs from rebellious [[vassal]]s), conquest, annexation, skillful marriages with heiresses of large fiefs, and even by purchase, the kings of France were able to increase the royal domain.  By the time of [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], the meaning of "royal domain" began to shift from a mere collection of lands and rights to a fixed territorial unit,&lt;ref&gt;Hallam, 247.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the sixteenth century the "royal domain" began to coincide with the entire kingdom.  However, the medieval system of [[appanage]] (a concession of a fief with its land rights by the sovereign to his younger sons, which reverts to the crown upon the extinction of the male line of the original holder) alienated large territories from the royal domain and sometimes created dangerous rivals (especially the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] from the 14th to the 15th centuries).

During the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], the alienation of lands and fiefs from the royal domain was frequently criticized.  The [[Edict of Moulins]] (1566) declared that the royal domain (defined in the second article as all the land controlled by the crown for more than ten years) could not be alienated, except in two cases: by interlocking, in the case of financial emergency, with a perpetual option to repurchase the land; and to form an appanage, which must return to the crown in its original state on the extinction of the male line.

Traditionally, the king was expected to survive from the revenues generated from the royal domain, but fiscal necessity, especially in times of war, led the kings to enact "exceptional" taxes, like the ''[[taille]]'', upon the whole of the kingdom (the ''taille'' became permanent in 1439).

==Chronology of the formation of the royal domain==
[[File:Capetian France.jpg|thumb|250x250px|The Kingdom of France at the time of Hugh Capet. French royal domain in blue.]]

These lands were largely the inheritance of the [[Robertians]], the direct ancestors of the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetians]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3275">'''Dramyin Cham''' ([[Dzongkha]]: '''Dramnyen Cham''') is a form of [[Cham dance]] - a masked and costumed dance performed in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] ceremonies in [[Bhutan]], [[Sikkim]], Himalayan [[West Bengal]] and [[Tibet]] (where they have been outlawed). They are a focal point of the Bhutanese festivals of [[Tsechu]]. The ''Dramyin Cham'' is notable among Cham dances as the lead dancer keeps time with a [[dramyin]] - a Himalayan [[folk music]] [[lute]], and not a traditional percussion instrument like the [[cymbal]]s. This is among the few instances of monastic music in the [[Himalayas]] where the use of a [[stringed instrument]] has been observed.&lt;ref name="dr"&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/culture/fr/file_download.php/93012f1857c2e04571e63ffeeaf409d2dobson.pdf Dancing on the demon's back: the dramnyen dance and song of Bhutan]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, by Elaine Dobson, John Blacking Symposium: Music
Culture and Society, Callaway Centre, University of Western Australia, July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depicted themes==

In the 13th century, monks from southern [[Tibet]] established the [[Drukpa Lineage]] of the [[Kagyu]] school of [[Vajrayana]] in [[Bhutan]]. This is celebrated in the Dramyin Cham as well as in the religious song "Dramyin Choeshay". Specifically, the dance celebrates an incident in Tibetan Buddhist mythology - the victory of the saint [[Tsangpa Gyare]] (1161-1211) over a demon which was obstructing a pilgrimage path to Tsari, Tibet at the mouth of a valley. The saint apparently subjugated the demon by performing a dramyin cham and it offered its services to him and became the guardian deity of the valley.&lt;ref name = "dr"/&gt;

==Costumes==
All participants in the Dramyin Cham are male, similar to the conventions pertaining to other Cham dances. The costumes of the dancers reflect the costume of armed [[lama]]s who acted as bodyguards to the Drukpa high lamas. The basic costume consists of elaborate, heavy, woolen clothes, a long, black Tibetan robe ([[chuba]]) lined with red, and long, colorful felt boots. Below the chuba, they typically wear a striped shirt with [[brocade]]d collars and cuffs of red, green and white. The leaders of the dance also wear a brown, folded jacket. One of the leaders carries the dramyin, with which he keeps time. All the dancers wear traditional armoury, weaponry, and ornaments.&lt;ref name ="dr"/&gt;

==Accompaniment and choreography==

The 17th century legislator [[Ngawang Namgyal]], the [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]] (1594 - 1651), under whom the [[Drukpa Lineage]] flourished, composed the lyrics and music for most of the present day [[Cham dance]]s (including the ''Dramyin Cham''), and authored the seminal work Gar-Thig-Yang Sum. The book indicates how most dances (including the ''Dramyin Cham'') should be choreographed and rendered. With the exception of the introduction and the coda, the dance can and usually is performed in simple [[time signature|two-time]]. The dance includes symbolic references to stamping and subjugating the demon.&lt;ref name = "dr"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3446">The '''East Baltic race''' is one of the subcategories of the Europid ([[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]) race into which it was divided by [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] and [[Scientific racism|scientific racists]] in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Maxwell [https://www.amazon.com/Picture-Imperfect-Photography-Eugenics-1870-1940/dp/1845194152 Picture Imperfect: Photography and Eugenics, 1870–1940] Brighton, Publication Date: April 1, 2010, {{ISBN|1845194152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such racial typologies have been rejected by modern anthropology for several reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Farber |first=Paul Lawrence |date=2010 |title=Mixing Races.

The term East Baltic race was coined by the anthropologist Rolf Nordenstreng, but was popularised by the race theorist [[Hans F. K. Günther]]. This race was living in Finland, Estonia and northern and central [[European Russia]]. It was characterized as "short-headed, broad-faced, with heavy, massive under-jaw, chin not prominent, flat, rather broad, short nose with low bridge; stiff, light ([[blond|ash-blond]]) hair; light ([[eye color#Gray|grey]] or [[eye color#Blue|whitish blue]]) eyes, standing out; light skin with a greyish undertone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schmitz-Berning|first= Cornelia|date= 2000|title=Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5r7Vrz3UgIC&amp;pg=PA455 |language=de |publisher=de Gruyter |isbn= |subscription=|page=455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunther also considered Poles to be predominantly of the "East Baltic" race, which he deemed inferior to the Nordic race,
saying: "However, owing to contra-selection among the Nordic warrior ruling classes, the conquest through the birth-rate by the East Baltic race among the north and west Slavs, must have had its beginning, and soon have become definitive."&lt;Ref&gt;Ibid, Chapter 10, paragraph 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[American Eugenics Society]] described East Baltic people as being [[Mongoloid|Mongolized]].&lt;ref&gt;American Eugenics Society, Eugenics Research Association.

Eugenics Record Office, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. Pp. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi philologist [[Josef Nadler]] declared the East Baltic race to be the main source of [[German Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Josef Nadler, Rassenkunde, Volkskunde, Stammeskunde. Dichtung und Volkstum 35 (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josef Nadler, Die Berliner Romantik 1810-1814. Berlin, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in the Third Reich the philologist [[Julius Petersen (philologist)|Julius Petersen]] wrote that [[Ludwig Tieck]]'s Romanticism might have been promoted by his possible Slavic heritage, referring to the American biographer [[Edwin H. Zeydel]]'s theory, that Tieck's grandmother was Russian.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Petersen, Die Wissenschaft von der Dichtung, 2nd posthumous and supplemented edition, Berlin, 1944. p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''El Molo''', also known as '''Elmolo''', '''Dehes''', '''Fura-Pawa''' and '''Ldes''', are an ethnic group mainly inhabiting the northern [[Eastern Province (Kenya)|Eastern Province]] of [[Kenya]]. They historically spoke the [[El Molo language]] as a mother tongue, an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch, and now most El Molo speak [[Samburu language|Samburu]].

==History==
The El Molo are believed to have originally migrated down into the [[Turkana Basin]] around 1000 BC from [[Ethiopia]] in the more northerly [[Horn of Africa|Horn]] region. Owing to the arid environment in which they entered, they are held to have then abandoned agricultural activities in favor of lakeside fishing.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=James L.|title=The Peopling of Africa: A Geographic Interpretation|year=1997|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300072805|page=166|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=pDjlC1ws158C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the El Molo erected tomb structures in which they placed their dead. A 1962 archaeological survey in the [[Northern Frontier District]] led by S. Brodribb Pughe observed [[hieroglyphics]] on a number of these constructions. They were mainly found near springs or wells of water.&lt;ref name="Pughe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pughe|first=S. Brodribb|title=A Preliminary Report Concerning Problems on the Origins and Ages of Certain of the Man-made Structures in the Northern Frontier District of Kenya and Certain Regions of the Eastern Horn of Africa|page=24|url=http://google.com/books?id=updtAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
The El Molo today primarily inhabit the northern [[Eastern Province (Kenya)|Eastern Province]] of Kenya. They are concentrated in [[Marsabit District]] on the southeast shore of [[Lake Turkana]], between [[El Molo]] bay and [[Mount Kulal]].&lt;ref name="Ethnelo"&gt;{{cite web|title=El Molo|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/elo|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, they also dwelled in other parts of the Northern Frontier District.&lt;ref name="Pughe"/&gt;

According to the 2009 Kenya census, there were 2,840 El Molo residents.&lt;ref name="Ethnelo"/&gt; However, historians have noted that there are few "pure" El Molo left. Most group members are today admixed with adjacent [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] populations, primarily [[Samburu people|Samburu]], with only a handful of unmixed El Molo believed to exist. Many El Molo speakers have also adopted cultural customs from these communities.&lt;ref name="Svf"&gt;{{cite book|title=Safari, Volume 4|year=1973|publisher=News Publications|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5H4wAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, there were reportedly only eight unmixed El Molo remaining.&lt;ref name="Ethnelo"/&gt;

==Language==
The El Molo historically spoke the [[El Molo language]] as a native language. It belongs to the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family.&lt;ref name="Ethnelo"/&gt;

According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', among other sources, the El Molo language is nearly extinct and there may already be no remaining speakers of the idiom. Most group members have now adopted the [[Nilo-Saharan languages]] of their neighbours.&lt;ref name="Ethnelo"/&gt;

The El Molo language has no known dialects. It is most similar to [[Daasanach language|Daasanach]].&lt;ref name="Ethnelo"/&gt;

==Genetics==
Recent advances in genetic analyses have helped shed some light on the [[ethnogenesis]] of the El Molo people. [[Genetic genealogy]], although a novel tool that uses the genes of modern populations to trace their ethnic and geographic origins, has also helped clarify the possible background of the modern El Molo.

===mtDNA===
According to an [[mtDNA]] study by Castri et al. (2008), the maternal ancestry of the contemporary El Molo consists of a mixture of Afro-Asiatic-associated lineages and Sub-Saharan haplogroups, reflecting substantial female gene flow from neighboring Sub-Saharan populations. A little over 30% of the El Molo belonged to the West Eurasian haplogroups [[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)|I]] (23%) and [[Haplogroup HV (mtDNA)|HV1]] (8%). Their frequencies of the rare I clade, which is believed to have originated in the Middle East, constitute a world high. The remaining El Molo samples carried various Sub-Saharan [[Macro-haplogroup L (mtDNA)|macro-haplogroup L]] sub-clades, mainly consisting of [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3*]] (26%), [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0a2]] (17%) and [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0f]] (17%).&lt;ref name="Castrí"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kenyan crossroads: migration and gene flow in six ethnic groups from Eastern Africa.|year= 2008|last=Castrí|pmid=19934476|url=http://www.isita-org.com/jass/Contents/2008%20vol86/12_Castri.pdf|volume=86|pages=189–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autosomal DNA===
The El Molo's [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[DNA]] has been examined in a comprehensive study by Tishkoff et al. (2009) on the genetic affiliations of various populations in Africa. According to the researchers, the El Molo showed significant Afro-Asiatic affinities. They also shared some ties with neighboring Nilo-Saharan and Bantu speakers in eastern Africa due to considerable genetic exchanges with these communities over the past 5000 or so years.&lt;ref name="Tishkoff2009"&gt;{{Citation | last = Tishkoff | title = The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans | journal = the American Association for the Advancement of Science | pages = 17| year = 2009 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1172257 |display-authors=etal}}; Also see [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/1172257/DC1 Supplementary Data]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Many El Molo practice a traditional religion centered on the worship of [[Waaq]]/Wakh.&lt;ref name="Ethnelo"/&gt; In the related Oromo culture, ''Waaq'' denotes the single god of the early pre-[[Abraham]]ic, [[Monotheism|montheistic]] faith believed to have been adhered to by Cushitic groups.&lt;ref name="Abdullahi"&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', (Greenwood Publishing Group: 2001), p.65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some El Molo have also adopted [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Ethnelo"/&gt;

The '''Federation of Workers Councils and Unions in Iraq''' (FWCUI) is the second largest [[union federation]] in [[Iraq]].

The federation was formed by members of the [[Union of the Unemployed of Iraq]], which is connected to the [[Worker Communist Party of Iraq]] as a [[left-wing]] alternative to the [[Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions]]. The latter is currently the only legally recognized union federation in Iraq; it is closely connected to the [[Iraqi Communist Party]], an organization which opposed the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 but decided to work with the new political institutions established after the occupation.

* This "legal recognition" of one union federation over another is a violation of the International Labour Organisation's Convention 87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise, to which Iraq and all the occupying powers are signatory.([http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040113043852/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/convdisp1.htm], look for Convention 87; [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948]].)

The FWCUI opposes both the U.S.-led [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]] and the [[Islamist]] elements of the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]], and it is often repressed by both the foreign and Islamist forces. Many [[anti-war]] movements around the world have provided venues for FWCUI speaker tours.  A third labor formation known as the [[Federation of Oil Unions in Iraq]] also exists.

The FWCUI's members have led a number of [[Strike action|strike]]s, and are particularly strong around the [[Basra]] region.

'''Filipinos in Singapore''' consists of citizens from the [[Philippines]] residing in [[Singapore]].

==Demographics==
In 2004 most Filipinos in Singapore were domestic workers.&lt;ref name=AFPGoogle&gt;"[http://phys.org/news/2014-06-google-singapore-blog-filipinos.html Google removes Singapore hate blog against Filipinos]" ( {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6QV4MwEHV?url=http://phys.org/news/2014-06-google-singapore-blog-filipinos.html |date=2014-06-21 }}). [[Agence France Presse]]. June 20, 2014. Retrieved on June 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, there were 163,090 citizens of the Philippines living in Singapore.&lt;ref name="POEA"/&gt; Between 2010 and 2012, about 45,450 Filipinos were newly hired into Singapore.&lt;ref name="POEA"/&gt;

==Controversies==

===Philippines Independence Day 2014 incident===
In May 2014, plans to hold celebrations for the Philippines Independence Day were cancelled due to online criticism of holding it in [[Orchard Road]], Singapore's main shopping district.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-28953147|title=Unease in Singapore over Filipino workers|publisher=BBC News|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/filipino-group-cancels-plans-hold-independence-day-celeb|title=Filipino group cancels plans to hold Independence Day celebration|publisher=The Straits Times|date=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indonesiarealtime/2014/04/22/filipino-group-awakens-anti-foreign-anger-in-singapore/|title=Filipino Group Awakens Anti-Foreign Anger in Singapore|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tan Tock Seng nurse incident/Edz Ello incident===
In January 2015, Ello Ed Mundsel Bello (also known as Edz Ello), a Filipino nurse working for [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital]] was sacked. He was then charged for posting anti-Singaporean remarks on his social media accounts in April in the same year.

His comments immediately went viral, leading to "netizens" lodging police reports against him. Right after his comments went viral, his employer [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital]], conducted internal investigations. He was also required to assist in police investigations. However, he only admitted to posting some of the offensive comments to both the hospital investigation team and the police force, he then claimed that his social media accounts were "hacked", with the "hackers" posting the offensive comments using his social media accounts.

Police investigations showed that all the comments were made by Edz Ello, and his account wasn't hacked as what he had told the police previously. Netizens also proved that this was not the first time that he had made such a post before this incident.

On April 7, 2015, Ello Ed Mundsel Bello was arrested and charged for 3 counts of subsequently lying to the police, and 2 counts of publishing seditious statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/01/12/1412123/filipino-nurse-sacked-anti-singapore-comments|publisher=PhilStar|date=January 12, 2015|title=Filipino nurse sacked for anti-Singapore comments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/more-singapore-stories/story/philippine-embassy-reminds-tan-tock-seng-nurse-watch-his|title=Philippine embassy reminds Tan Tock Seng nurse to watch his social media usage|publisher=The Straits Times|date=Jan 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in an online petition on Facebook to deport the nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/why-filipino-nurse-had-be-sacked|title=Why Filipino nurse had to be sacked|publisher=AsiaOne|date=Jan 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 Sept 2015, Bello was sentenced to 4 months' jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/edz-ello-jailed-four-months-disparaging-remarks-against-singaporeans|date=September 22, 2015|title='Edz Ello' gets 4 months' jail for seditious posts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since June 2017 unexplained '''hair chopping''' or '''braid chopping incidents''' have been reported in India and Nepal. The first widely reported incident was on June 23, 2017: [[ABP News]] reported a woman from [[Bikaner district|Bikaner]], [[Rajasthan]], had her hair chopped by a 'witch' as she slept. Similar incidents were increasingly reported throughout India, particularly in the northern states of [[Delhi]], [[Bihar]], [[Haryana]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], and [[Indian Administered Kashmir|Indian-administered Kashmir]].

==India==
===Rajasthan===
On June 23, 2017 [[ABP News]] reported a woman from [[Bikaner district|Bikaner]], [[Rajasthan]] had her hair chopped by a 'witch' as she slept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abpnews.abplive.in/videos/viral-sach-is-there-a-witch-who-chops-off-people-s-hair-while-they-are-asleep-642035|title=रात में लोगों की बाल काटने वाली 'चुड़ैल' का वायरल सच|date=2017-06-23|work=ABP News|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional hair-chopping incidents followed, and fears of an epidemic{{snd}}particularly in Rajasthan{{snd}}soared. Incidents occurred not only at night but also during the day.

Three days before the June 23 event, a similar incident was reported in [[Piparcity|Pipad City]], [[Jodhpur]], where a girl's hair had been found cut when she awoke in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.bhaskar.com/news/RAJ-JOD-HMU-MAT-latest-jodhpur-news-043016-2841137-NOR.html|title=रात में बाल काटने की अफवाह या सच्चाई, पुलिस के लिए पहेली|date=2017-06-20|work=dainikbhaskar|access-date=2017-08-23|language=hi}}&lt;/ref&gt; This news was first reported by [[Dainik Bhaskar]]. Along with the missing hair, the girl displayed injuries on other parts of her body.&lt;sup&gt;[which parts?]&lt;/sup&gt; When police investigated, they found that the girl's hair had been cut by a blade. However, they were unable to find the culprit.

On July 6, 2017 the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' reported that two girls from Rajasthan, aged 13 and 14 years old, and both unknown to each other, were victims of additional hair incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-s-scissorhands-panic-in-villages-after-ghost-chops-off-women-s-hair/story-bQ0ZHij1WVQGOeHTPzybaI.html|title=Rajasthan’s scissorhands? Panic in villages after ‘ghost’ chops off women’s hair| date=2017-07-06|work=hindustantimes.com/|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2017 the [[BBC]] reported that many western municipalities including [[Bikaner]], [[Nagaur]], [[Jaisalmer]], [[Barmer, Rajasthan|Barmer]], [[Jodhpur]], and [[Jalore]] had been affected by these incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/hindi/india-40542956|title=अफ़वाहों से परेशान हैं राजस्थान की महिलाएं|last=राठौड़|first=सुमेर सिंह|date=2017-07-08|work=BBC हिंदी|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uttar Pradesh===
In early August 2017, two cases were reported from [[Aligarh]] and [[Moradabad]]. Four cases were reported in [[Bulandshahr]]. But later [[Uttar Pradesh]] (UP) police and [[Delhi Police]] clarified that the incidents were only rumours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fresh-cases-of-mysterious-hair-chopping-surface-in-aligarh-moradabad-and-bulandshahr-uttar-pradesh-delhi-4783182/|title=Fresh cases of mysterious hair-chopping surface in Aligarh, Moradabad and Bulandshahr|date=2017-08-05|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Indian Express]] news channel, around thirty cases were filed all over north India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/fresh-cases-of-mysterious-hair-chopping-surface-in-aligarh-moradabad-and-bulandshahr-uttar-pradesh-delhi-4783182/|title=Fresh cases of mysterious hair-chopping surface in Aligarh, Moradabad and Bulandshahr|date=2017-08-05|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2, a 62-year-old woman was killed by angry villagers in [[Agra]] for being accused as a "witch" who cut the braids of girls. [[NDTV India]] reported this news on August 3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.ndtv.com/india-news/woman-branded-witch-killed-in-uttar-pradesh-amid-braid-cutting-scare-1733038|title=Woman Branded Witch, Killed In UP Amid 'Braid Cutting' Scare|website=m.ndtv.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; UP police filed murder cases on two suspects who fled the city and were neighbors of the victim.

===Delhi===
On August 1, 2017 three women, unknown to each other and aged between 50 and 60, from [[Kangan Heri]] complained about being the victims of hair-chopping incidents on the same day. None of the women had seen their perpetrator, but when they fell unconscious and later woke up, they found their hair chopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1046374/a-mysterious-braid-chopper-is-cutting-off-womens-hair-in-northern-india/|title=A mysterious "braid-chopper" is cutting off women’s hair in northern India|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haryana===
Fifteen cases were reported in Haryana state. The women who were victims of these types of incidents said that they had witnessed "god-men", "witches" and "cat-like creatures". The police rejected these claims.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

One such incident happened in [[Gurgaon]] on July 28, when a 60-year-old woman found her braid chopped when she awoke on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/07/31/mysterious-incidents-of-womens-braids-being-chopped-off-spreads_a_23057298/|title=Mysterious Incidents Of Women's Braids Being Chopped Off Spreads Panic In Haryana Villages|date=2017-07-31|website=Huffington Post India|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made claims that a thin man came to her doorsteps with a trident in his hand. She claims she asked him to leave, but he reappeared, which led her to fall unconscious. The police filed the case and entered it in the Daily Diary.{{Explain|date=January 2018}}

===Jammu and Kashmir===
In this occupied region of India, there have been more than 200 incidents of women being attacked and often knocked unconscious by men in balaclavas, who then chop off their traditional hair braids. Officers had no solid leads or suspects, and [[Kashmir|Kashmiri]] police had to respond to a surge of revenge attacks by vigilantes armed with knives, [[Cricket bat|cricket bats]], and iron rods.

The initial police response to the braid attacks, which mainly occurred inside people's homes, was to suggest the victims were suffering from hallucinations. This drew criticism from the government-run Women's Commission, and they began serious investigations but no arrests have been made.{{when|date=May 2018|need a citation and an as-of to date it.}}

Tasleema Bilal, a 40-year-old woman whose hair was recently{{when|date=May 2018}} cut off while she was in her home in [[Srinagar]], the region's main city, said that she tried to remove the attacker's mask before escaping, leaving her hair behind. Other women have said that they were knocked unconscious with a mysterious chemical spray that authorities have yet to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/mysterious-braid-chopping-bandits-have-kashmiris-in-panic-1.3646003|title=Mysterious braid-chopping bandits have Kashmiris in panic|last=Hussain|first=Aijaz|date=2017-10-24|work=CTVNews|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-5013827/Armed-vigilantes-Kashmir-fight-hair-chopping-bandits.html|title=Armed vigilantes in Kashmir fight hair-chopping bandits|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/892d2948287b4a3fb230f9597c654d1f|title=Mystery attacks chopping women's hair raise panic in Kashmir|work=AP News|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kashmiris have alleged the attacks are the "handiwork of Indian agencies" trying to intimidate the portion of Kashmir's population that opposes Indian rule.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Residents are also suspicious of the Indian authorities, and some have accused soldiers and police of staging the attacks or protecting those responsible. In many incidents, the police and army appeared to aid the braid choppers in escaping by taking and saving them from public vigilantes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/24/women-living-fear-braid-chopping-bandits/&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2017, [[Arab News]], a Saudi Arabian news agency, reported that around 100 women in [[Kashmir]] have been victims of hair-chopping incidents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/1181506/world|title=Mystery ‘braid-chopping’ cases add panic to trauma in Kashmir|date=2017-10-22|work=Arab News|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Religious responses==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018|the cultural importance of a woman's hair (and the act of removing it) in these regions.}}

===Hinduism===
In the June 23 case, the victim's legs and hands had a ''[[Trishula]]'' mark,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abpnews.abplive.in/videos/viral-sach-is-there-a-witch-who-chops-off-people-s-hair-while-they-are-asleep-642035|title=रात में लोगों की बाल काटने वाली 'चुड़ैल' का वायरल सच|date=2017-06-23|work=ABP News|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; linking the incident to Hinduism. However, no Hindu religious leaders have responded to this detail.

===Islam===
Some [[Indian Muslims]] have also been victims of these types of incidents. Some Islamic scholars stated that these incidents are being executed by mischievous elements in society.

==Change in the rumor==
On August 19, a report from [[Dainik Bhaskar]] changed the discussion surrounding these events. The report clearly proved that there was no such evidence of a witch or a ghost being responsible. In this report, a man from [[Gwalior]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]  caught an insect which was later suspected to be a [[dermestidae]], [[drugstore beetle]], [[rain beetle]] or [[varied carpet beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.bhaskar.com/news/c-6-scarce-insect-found-claimed-to-be-the-hair-scrapping-beetle-gw0197-NOR.html|title=चोटी काटने वाला समझ पकड़ ली ये अजीब चीज, फिर ये सच्चाई आई सामने|date=2017-08-16|work=dainikbhaskar|access-date=2017-08-22|language=hi}}&lt;/ref&gt; This insect is believed to feed on keratin found in hair and nails.{{explain|date=May 2018|How does finding a beetle prove anything?}}

A similar case occurred on August 9, when a man killed a [[Badger|honey badger]] accused of eating or chopping women's hair, but due to lack of evidence, this report faced negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hindi.oneindia.com/news/uttar-pradesh/women-suspect-an-animal-as-hair-cutter-418241.html|title=VIDEO: बाल काटने की अफवाह में भेंट चढ़ा 'बिज्जू'|work=hindi.oneindia.com|access-date=2017-08-23|language=hi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, a report from [[Manpur, Bhopal|Manpur]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] had several eyewitnesses. The incident happened around 4&amp;nbsp;pm as the victim was sitting outside her house. She suddenly felt that her hair was being cut off. Her screaming brought the attention of her grandmother, who saw that her hair was being cut off, but she did not see anyone do it. Her grandmother quickly caught her fallen hair and the cutting stopped. Later the grandmother discovered an unusual detail. She noticed that as she picked up and held the hair, the rest of her granddaughter's hair was sheared, except for the exact number of hairs she held.{{Explanation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.firstwall.com/news/top-news/newstrack/e83d867fea5d37b504c196dd57bf44cb?ref=fw-sim|title=चोटी काटने के मामले में नया मोड़, जितने बाल हाथ में आए बच गए बाकि गिर गए नीचे|work=firstwall|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugh Mason''' (30&amp;nbsp;January 1817 &amp;ndash; 2&amp;nbsp;February 1886) was an English [[cotton mill|mill]] owner, [[social reformer]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician. He was born in [[Stalybridge]] and brought up in Stalybridge and [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] until he entered the family [[Textile industry|cotton business]] in 1838 after a seven-year period working in a bank. Having originally opposed trade unions, Mason became a paternalistic mill owner, creating a colony for his workers with associated facilities and ensuring that they experienced good conditions. During the [[Lancashire Cotton Famine]] of the 1860s he refused to cut workers' wages although it was common practice.

Mason became the first Liberal to be elected councillor for Ashton-under-Lyne in 1856. He was mayor of the council from 1857 to 1860 and retired from local politics in 1874 due to conflict with his own party. Mason returned to the Liberals in 1878 when he stood for election as Member of Parliament for [[Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashton-under-Lyne]]. He was voted in and supported progressive policies, which included [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]], making him unpopular within his own party. He was MP from 1880 to 1885. When he died in 1886, aged 69, Hugh Mason had amassed £290,933 (now about £17&amp;nbsp;million).

==Early life and business career==
Hugh Mason was born in [[Stalybridge]], Cheshire, on 11&amp;nbsp;May 1817&lt;ref&gt;Nevell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt; and christened there. He was the youngest of four children of Thomas Mason, a former textile manager, and Mary, the daughter of John Holden, Esq.&lt;ref name="Nevell 43"&gt;Nevell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt; The family had moved to Stalybridge from [[Derbyshire]] in 1776.&lt;ref name="Tameside"&gt;{{cite web |title=Township Information - Ashton |url=http://www.tameside.gov.uk/ashton/history |publisher=Tameside.gov.uk}} Retrieved on 12&amp;nbsp;September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After working as the manager of a mill in Ashton-under-Lyne, Thomas established his own business in 1815 in partnership with James Booth and Edward Hulton at Currier Slacks Mill in the town. Rapid growth in their enterprise saw them expand into the Bank Mill and Royal George Mills in the 1820s and Albion Mill in the 1830s. At the age of 10, Hugh was working in the mill,&lt;ref name="Tameside"/&gt; and his education consisted of attending [[Methodist]] [[Sunday school]]s in Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge and spending three years at a private school in Ashton-under-Lyne.&lt;ref name="Nevell 43"/&gt;

After leaving school at the age of 14, Mason got a job with the district bank while he attended night school in his spare time. He worked there until 1838, when he left at the age of 21 to join the family's cotton business. He became the driving force behind the business.&lt;ref name="Nevell 43"/&gt; The business thrived: by the early 1850s the Mason family had built two state-of-the-art cotton mills in the [[Ryecroft, Greater Manchester|Ryecroft]] area of Ashton-under-Lyne, known as the Oxford Mills. He was able to purchase Groby Hall, in Ashton, the ancestral seat of the former Lord Greys of Groby.&lt;ref&gt;British Parliamentary Members, vol.2 of 4, p.263&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, to house the workers for the mills, Mason began construction of a "workers' colony". The colony not only provided 150 terrace houses{{#tag:ref|Some of these houses still survive, including Hamilton Street, Gibson Terrace and "The Twelve Apostles" in Trafalgar Square.|group=notes}} (housing an estimated 691 people in 1872) but also leisure facilities such as a library, a swimming pool, a gymnasium, and a reading room.&lt;ref&gt;Nevell (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;44&amp;ndash;45.&lt;/ref&gt; Mason built up what he saw as a model industrial community,&lt;ref name="Tameside"/&gt; and according to Mason himself, the annual death rate was significantly lower than in the rest of Ashton-under-Lyne.&lt;ref&gt;Nevell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;44.&lt;/ref&gt; Residents were expected to adhere to his strict moral code and he discouraged the use of [[public house]]s.&lt;ref name="Tameside"/&gt; He estimated that establishing the settlement cost him around £10,000 and a further £1,000 per year to maintain (about £600,000 today and a further £60,000 to maintain).&lt;ref name="Nevell 45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="currency"/&gt;

Under Hugh Mason's leadership, the company prospered. The number of [[Spinning mule|mule spindles]] in use at the mills increased from 20,000 in 1846 to 75,000 in 1887. His two brothers, Henry and Booth, also worked in the company until retired in 1848&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=20909|page=3856|date=27&amp;nbsp;October 1848}} Retrieved on 2&amp;nbsp;October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1853 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21461|page=2067|date=26&amp;nbsp;July 1853}} Retrieved on 2&amp;nbsp;October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Their father remained active in the company until 1860 when he retired, leaving Hugh as the sole owner.&lt;ref name="Nevell 43"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22376|page=1456|date=13&amp;nbsp;April 1860}} Retrieved on 2&amp;nbsp;October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Manchester Cotton Company'' was set up in 1860 and Mason's success in the cotton industry led him to become its chairman from the beginning until its winding up, which began in 1864,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22896|page=4587|date=23&amp;nbsp;September 1864}} Retrieved on 2&amp;nbsp;October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but was not concluded until 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=23339|page=10|date=3&amp;nbsp;January 1868}} Retrieved on 2&amp;nbsp;October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the company was to increase the number of producers of cotton; this was important as the American market was closed off during the [[American Civil War]], causing the [[Lancashire Cotton Famine]].&lt;ref&gt;Logan (1958), p.&amp;nbsp;472.&lt;/ref&gt; Mason served as President of the [[Manchester]] [[Chamber of Commerce]] from 1871 to 1874, and came to hold interests in the [[Bridgewater Canal]] Navigation Company, the [[Midland Railway Company]], the [[Mersey Docks and Harbour Company|Mersey Dock Board]], and various other coal and iron companies.&lt;ref name="Nevell 43"/&gt;
 
Having initially opposed trade unions and factory legislation, Mason changed his mind around the 1850s regarding how workers should be treated, believing that the welfare of the employees impacted on the welfare of the employer.&lt;ref name="Nevell 45"/&gt; He became popular among workers for such things as becoming the first local employer to give his workers Saturday afternoons off.&lt;ref name="Tameside"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nevell 45"/&gt; During the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861&amp;ndash;1865 he refused to cut workers' wages as was common during the period. He stated: {{quote|I will keep my work people employed, and if there is no work, lend them money from my own pocket rather than have them apply for relief. The poor rate is only 1''[[Shilling (British coin)|s]]'' 6''[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]]'' in the pound. I will pay as high a poor rate as the Poor Law Guardians deem necessary.&lt;ref name="Nevell 45"/&gt;}}

As well as this, he contributed £500 (about the equivalent of £30,000 today) to the Ashton borough cotton famine relief.&lt;ref name="Nevell 45"/&gt; During the tumultuous 1870s and 1880s, Mason kept his workforce fully employed and continued to invest in his mills. By 1884, wages in his mills were 25% higher than they had been in 1870 even though his employees were working fewer hours. The ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' noted:

{{quote|Hugh Mason is one of the first amongst those wealthy manufacturers of Lancashire who devote the hours which are not occupied by business to the service of their fellow men. He has been accustomed to take a leading part in the various public improvements, and he has long been a political chief. At Ashton he is unpopular: the ruggedness which mars his virtues, and the self assertion which stamps his conduct, do not invite the affection of his fellow. Although he has done more than any other millowner on securing the physical and social well-being of his employees, he is not highly esteemed. He has built for his workpeople admirable cottages, swimming baths, gymnasiums and lecture halls, but beneficent acts do not suffice to secure popularity unless there is a suavity of manner and sympathy of nature in the benefactor, and these are qualities which Mr Mason lacks. Mr Mason is a staunch liberal, and is reckoned to be one of the oracles of the local party. His figure is a familiar one at free trade meetings where the citizens of Manchester never fail to receive him with the utmost enthusiasm. The working men hail his appearance with tempestuous applause, and invariable reward his rhetorical efforts with frequent and deafening cheers.&lt;ref name="Nevell 45"/&gt;}}

==Political career==

===Local===
Hugh Mason was influenced by his father's Liberal politics and strongly opposed to injustice and prejudice. Thomas Mason was a supporter of political representation for Ashton-under-Lyne and supported the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]].&lt;ref name="Nevell 43"/&gt; In the early 19th century, the area was poorly represented in Parliament. The major urban centres of [[Manchester]], [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]], [[Bolton]], [[Blackburn]], [[Rochdale]], Ashton-under-Lyne, [[Oldham]] and [[Stockport]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; with a combined population of almost one million&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; were represented by either the two county MPs for Lancashire (or the two for [[Cheshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Cheshire]] in the case of Stockport). By comparison, more than half of all MPs were elected by a total of just 154&amp;nbsp;voters.&lt;ref&gt;Reid (1989), p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt; These inequalities in political representation led to calls for reform and eventually the [[Peterloo Massacre]] in 1819. Hugh said of his father that "To his life of honest industry, to his example of commercial probity, to his high Christian character, to his training, of me in my early years, to his wise consuls, I owe under God my position in society."&lt;ref name="Nevell 43"/&gt;

Although he claimed he was reluctant to enter politics, Hugh Mason became the first [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] elected councillor for Ashton-under-Lyne in November 1856. He represented the Portland Place [[Wards of the United Kingdom|ward]] from 1856 until his retirement from politics in 1874. Mason quickly made an impression and was elected mayor for three consecutive years between 1857 and 1860, which had never happened before.&lt;ref name="Nevell 45"&gt;Nevell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported progressive measures such as opening a public park, providing public libraries, and addressing unsanitary conditions in parts of Ashton-under-Lyne.&lt;ref name="Nevell 45"/&gt;

Mason's policies led him to come into constant clashes with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] members of the council. He was not always popular within his own party either and he even financed his own newspaper, the ''Ashton-under-Lyne News'', to convey his views and provide competition for the pro-Liberal ''Ashton Reporter''. Conflict with the Liberals drove Mason into early retirement from local politics in 1874 at the age of 57.&lt;ref name="Nevell 46"&gt;Nevell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as being a councillor, Mason was also elected a local magistrate for Ashton-under-Lyne in 1857. During his time in office he had to deal with the bread riots of 21&amp;ndash;22&amp;nbsp;March 1863 (caused by the cotton famine) and the Murphy Riots in May 1868.&lt;ref name="Nevell 46"/&gt; The Murphy Riots were anti-Catholic demonstrations, fueled by [[Fenian]]ism (an Irish nationalist organisation), across Lancashire led by William Murphy.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd (2008), p.&amp;nbsp;174.&lt;/ref&gt; He personally went to one mob during the Murphy Riots to read them the [[riot act]] face-to-face.&lt;ref name="Nevell 46"/&gt;  He was appointed a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of the [[County Palatine of Lancaster]] on 21 June 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22535|page=3534|date=15&amp;nbsp;July 1862}} Retrieved on 2&amp;nbsp;October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such was his significance in Manchester he was appointed President of the Chamber of Commerce for two years from 1871.  At the same time he was a Governor of Owen's College in the city.  Mason was appointed a member of the Board of the Mersey Docks and Harbour.

===National===
[[File:81 King St.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Manchester Reform Club building. Mason was a founder member of the club.]]
Mason, along with a group of other Advanced Liberals supporting John Morley, the gladstonian, was one of the founding members of the [[Former Reform Club, Manchester|Reform Club]] in Manchester, a political club founded in 1867 for Liberals and their supporters.&lt;ref name="Nevell 46"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Catalogue of Papers of the Manchester Reform Club |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=133-mrc&amp;cid=0|work=Access to Archives |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|format=Papers held by [[John Rylands Library]], [[University of Manchester]]}} Retrieved on 16&amp;nbsp;October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite retiring from local politics because of conflict with the Liberals, by 1878 he was back in favour and Liberal councillors were encouraging Mason to stand for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]]ary election.&lt;ref name="Nevell 46"/&gt; Although he was a popular candidate, he was initially reluctant to put himself forward. However, he stood for Parliament in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 General Elections]]. His campaign in March and April 1880 involved vitriolic attacks on the local Conservative Party and on 3&amp;nbsp;April 1880 he was elected [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] for [[Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashton-under-Lyne]], beating his opponent, John Ross Coulthart, by 2,966 votes to 2,586.&lt;ref&gt;Nevell (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;46&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24830|page=2390|date=6&amp;nbsp;April 1880}} Retrieved on 2&amp;nbsp;October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an MP he lived at 33 Onslow Square, Kensington, and was a member of the Reform Club.&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who of British Parliamentary Members, 4 vols, London, vol.2, p.263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mason supported many reformist bills and became a spokesman of the Women's Suffrage Association in 1881.  He proposed motions for women's suffrage in 1881 and again in 1883 but was defeated on both occasions.&lt;ref name="Nevell 47"/&gt; He led the women's suffrage movement until 1883 when illness forced him to retreat from public life temporarily. His defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 General Elections]] was ascribed to his support of [[William Ewart Gladstone]] over the issue of [[Irish Home Rule bills|Irish Home Rule]] and to his illness.  He lost to the Conservative [[John Edmund Wentworth Addison|John Wentworth Addison]] by 3,152 votes to 3,104.  Mason demanded a recount, but this increased the majority by one vote; he succumbed to illness and died before the result was announced.&lt;ref name="Nevell 47"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1846 Hugh Mason married Sarah Buckley, the daughter of Abel Buckley, Esq, who was also the father of [[Abel Buckley]] Businessman and MP, another cotton mill owner who went on to be a millionaire businessman and landowner.  They had one child, Arnold, who was born in 1851. Sarah died in 1852 at the age of 29. Mason next married Sarah's sister, Betsy, though it was illegal to marry one's sister-in-law in England at the time. To overcome this problem they married in [[Denmark]] on 7&amp;nbsp;June 1854. Their marriage was approved by special licence from the King of Denmark and was held at the Evangellic Reform Church, [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] in the [[Duchy of Holstein]]. They had four&amp;nbsp;children: Bertha, born in 1855, Edith in 1857, Rupert in 1859 and Sydney in 1861. Betsy died after the birth of Sydney and Mason then married for a third time Annie, daughter of George Ashworth, Esq, of Rochdale in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|newspaper=[[Manchester Times]] |date=15 June 1854}}&lt;br /&gt;·{{citation|newspaper=[[The Morning Chronicle]] |date=16 June 1854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh Mason died three days after his 69th birthday on 2&amp;nbsp;February 1886&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25610|page=3589|date=23&amp;nbsp;July 1886}} Retrieved on 2&amp;nbsp;October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; at his home, Groby Hall. At his death, he had amassed a fortune worth £290,933 (now worth about £17M).&lt;ref name="currency"&gt;{{cite web |title=Currency converter |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]}} Retrieved on 12&amp;nbsp;September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nevell 47"&gt;Nevell (1994), p.&amp;nbsp;47.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first person to have a statue (now protected as a Grade II [[listed building]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hugh Mason memorial statue |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=212658 |publisher=Images of England}} Retrieved on 12&amp;nbsp;September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; erected in his honour in [[Tameside]]; it was financed by public subscription immediately after Mason's death.&lt;ref name="Nevell 47"/&gt;

'''Indigenous peoples of Mexico''' ({{lang-es|pueblos indígenas de México}}), '''Native Mexicans''' ({{lang-es|nativos mexicanos}}), or '''Mexican Native Americans''' ({{lang-es|Mexicanos nativo americanos}}), are those who are part of communities that trace their roots back to populations and communities that existed in what is now [[Mexico]] prior to the arrival of Europeans.

According to the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples]] (''Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas'', or CDI in Spanish) and the [[INEGI]] (official census institute), in 2015, 25,694,928 people in Mexico self-identify as being indigenous&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the 2010 census "indigenous" people were defined as persons who live in a household where an indigenous language is spoken by one of the adult family members, and or people who self identified as indigenous ("Criteria del hogar: De esta manera, se establece, que los hogares indígenas son aquellos en donde el jefe y/o el cónyuge y/o padre o madre del jefe y/o suegro o suegra del jefe hablan una lengua indígena y también aquellos que declararon pertenecer a un grupo indígena|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=272&amp;Itemid=58|website=Cdi.gob.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Persons who speak an indigenous language but who do not live in such a household (Por lo antes mencionado, la Comisión Nacional Para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas de México (CDI) considera población indígena (PI) a todas las personas que forman parte de un hogar indígena, donde el jefe(a) del hogar, su cónyuge y/o alguno de los ascendientes (madre o padre, madrastra o padrastro, abuelo(a), bisabuelo(a), tatarabuelo(a), suegro(a)) declaro ser hablante de lengua indígena.

== Definition ==
In the second article of its [[constitution of Mexico|Constitution]], Mexico is defined as a "pluricultural" nation in recognition of the diverse ethnic groups that constitute it and where the [[indigenous peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;"Indigenous peoples" is the preferred term in Mexico to refer to the Amerindian ethnic groups in North America&lt;/ref&gt; are the original foundation.&lt;ref name="cons"&gt;[http://constitucion.gob.mx/index.php?idseccion=11&amp;ruta=1 Constitución Política de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331171639/http://constitucion.gob.mx/index.php?idseccion=11&amp;ruta=1 |date=2009-03-31 }} Art. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of indigenous Mexicans is judged using the political criteria found in the 2nd article of the Mexican constitution. The Mexican census does not report racial-ethnicity but only the cultural-ethnicity of indigenous communities that preserve their indigenous languages, traditions, beliefs and cultures.&lt;ref name="CDI"&gt;[http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=62&amp;Itemid=24]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023172638/http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=62&amp;Itemid=24 |date=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of ''indigena'' (indigenous) can be defined narrowly according to linguistic criteria including only persons that speak one of [[Languages of Mexico|Mexico's 89 indigenous languages]], this is the categorization used by the National Mexican Institute of Statistics. It can also be defined broadly to include all persons who self identify as having an indigenous cultural background, whether or not they speak the language of the indigenous group they identify with. This means that the percentage of the Mexican population defined as "indigenous" varies according to the definition applied; cultural activists have referred to the usage of the narrow definition of the term for census purposes as "statistical genocide".&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:73-74)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé (1996:3-4)&lt;/ref&gt;

The indigenous peoples in Mexico have the right of free determination under the second article of the constitution. According to this article the indigenous peoples are granted:
* the right to decide the internal forms of social, economic, political, and cultural organization;
* the right to apply their own normative systems of regulation as long as human rights and gender equality are respected;
* the right to preserve and enrich their languages and cultures;

==History of the Indigenous Peoples==

===Pre-Columbian civilizations===
{{See also|Mesoamerican chronology}}
[[File:Mesoamerica english.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Mesoamerica and its cultural areas]]
[[File:Ancient Cultures2.svg|thumb|right|350px|Map of major prehispanic archaeological sites in Northwest Mexico and the US Southwest]]
The [[pre-Columbian|prehispanic]] civilizations of what now is known as Mexico are usually divided in two regions: [[Mesoamerica]], in reference to the cultural area where several complex civilizations developed before the arrival of the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] in the sixteenth century, and [[Aridoamerica]] (or simply "The North")&lt;ref name="Hamnett"&gt;Hamnett, Brian (1999), ''A Concise History of Mexico'', Cambridge University Press; Cambridge, UK&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the arid region north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]] where few civilizations developed and was mostly inhabited by nomadic or semi-nomadic groups.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Despite the conditions however, it is argued that the [[Mogollon culture]] and Peoples successfully established population centers at [[Casas Grandes]] and [[Cuarenta Casas]] in a vast territory that encompassed northern Chihuahua state and parts of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] in the United States. 

Mesoamerica was densely populated by diverse indigenous ethnic groups&lt;ref name="Hamnett"/&gt;{{pn|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref name="aguilar"&gt;Manuel Aguilar-Moreno (2004) ''A Handbook to Life in the Aztec World'' Facts of Life, Inc., USA&lt;/ref&gt; which, although sharing common cultural characteristics, spoke different languages and developed unique civilizations.

One of the most influential civilizations that developed in Mesoamerica was the [[Olmec]] civilization, sometimes referred to as the "Mother Culture of Mesoamerica".&lt;ref name="aguilar"/&gt; The later civilization in [[Teotihuacán]] reached its peak around 600 AD, when the city became the sixth largest city in the world,&lt;ref name="aguilar"/&gt; whose cultural and theological systems influenced the [[Toltec]] and [[Aztec]] civilizations in later centuries. Evidence has been found on the existence of multiracial communities or neighborhoods in Teotihuacan (and other large urban areas like [[Tenochtitlan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frogreview.com/quest-aztlan/|title=Contact Us - Frog Review|website=Frogreview.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/mexico/ |title=New Tomb at Teotihuacan |publisher=Archaeology.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maya civilization]], though also influenced by other Mesoamerican civilizations, developed a vast cultural region in south-east Mexico and northern Central America, while the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] and [[Mixtec]] culture dominated the [[valley of Oaxaca]], and the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] in western Mexico.

===Trade===
There is common academic agreement that significant systems of trading existed between the cultures of [[Mesoamerica]], [[Aridoamerica]] and the [[American Southwest]], and the architectural remains and artifacts share a commonality of knowledge attributed to this trade network.  The routes stretched far into Mesoamerica and reached as far north to ancient communities that included such population centers in the United States such as at [[Snaketown]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://westerndigs.org/mesoamerican-fools-gold-mirrors-found-in-arizona-reveal-ties-to-ancient-mexico/|title=Mesoamerican ‘Fool’s Gold’ Mirrors Found in Arizona Reveal Ties to Ancient Mexico|work=Western Digs|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaco Canyon]], and Ridge Ruin near [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] (considered some of the finest artifacts ever located).

===Colonial era===
{{Main|New Spain}}
[[Image:Malinche Tlaxcala.jpg|thumb|300px|A 16th-century manuscript illustrating [[La Malinche]] and the contact of Spaniards and [[Aztecs]].]]

By the time of the arrival of the Spanish in central Mexico, many of the diverse ethnic civilizations (with the notable exception of the [[Tlaxcaltec]]s and the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] Kingdom of [[Michoacán]]) were loosely joined under the [[Aztec Empire]], the last [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] civilization to flourish in Central Mexico. The capital of the empire, [[Tenochtitlan]], became one of the largest urban centers in the world, with an estimated population of 350,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Hamnett"/&gt;{{pn|date=February 2018}}

During the [[conquest of the Aztec Empire]], the Spanish conquistadors, vastly outnumbered by indigenous peoples, used the ethnic diversity of the country and exploited the discontentment of the subjugated groups, making important alliances with rivals of the Aztecs.&lt;ref name="Hamnett"/&gt;{{pn|date=February 2018}} While the alliances were decisive to the Europeans' victory, the indigenous peoples were soon subjugated by an equally impressive empire.  However, as the Spanish consolidated their rule in what became the [[viceroyalty of New Spain]], the crown recognized the indigenous nobility in [[Mesoamerica]] as nobles and kept the existing basic structure of indigenous city-states. Indigenous communities were incorporated as communities under Spanish rule and with the indigenous power structure largely intact.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519-1810'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Spanish incorporation of indigenous into the colonial system, the friars taught indigenous scribes to write their languages in Latin letters so that there are huge corpus of colonial-era documentation in the [[Nahuatl]] language, [[Mixtec]], [[Zapotec languages|Zapotec]], and Yucatec [[Mayan languages|Maya]] as well as others. Such a written tradition likely took hold because there was an existing tradition of pictorial writing found in many indigenous [[codices]]. Scholars have utilized the colonial-era alphabetic documentation in what is currently called the [[New Philology]] to illuminate the colonial experience of Mesoamerican peoples from their own viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Mesoamerican peoples had an existing requirement of labor duty and tribute in the pre-conquest era, Spaniards who were awarded the labor and tribute of particular communities in [[encomienda]] could benefit financially.  Indigenous officials in their communities were involved in maintaining this system.  There was a precipitous decline in indigenous populations due to the spread of European diseases previously unknown in the New World. Pandemics wrought havoc, but indigenous communities recovered with fewer members.&lt;ref name="Hamnett"/&gt;{{pn|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Gibson, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Lockhart, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

With contact between Europeans, the black slaves that they brought, and indigenous populations, there was intermingling of the groups, with mixed-race [[castas]], particularly [[mestizo]]s, becoming a component of Spanish cities and to a lesser extent indigenous communities.  The Spanish legal structure formally separated what they called the ''república de indios'' (the republic of Indians) from the ''república de españoles'' (republic of Spaniards), the latter of which encompassed all those in the Hispanic sphere: Europeans, Africans, and mixed-race castas. Although in many ways indigenous peoples were marginalized in the colonial system,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odiseo.com.mx/2004/07/03lopezflores_colonialismo.htm Colonialismo y modernidad: la enseñanza del español en la Nueva España], "...El racismo y la estratificación de la población de la Nueva España fueron las características de la organización social del Virreinato..."&lt;/ref&gt;  the paternalistic structure of colonial rule supported the continued existence and structure of indigenous communities.  The Spanish crown recognized the existing ruling group, gave protection to the land holdings of indigenous communities, and communities' and individuals had access to the Spanish legal system.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Borah, ''Justice by Insurance: The General Indian Court of Colonial Mexico and the Legal Aides of the Half-Real'', Berkeley: University of California Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice in central Mexico this meant that until the nineteenth-century liberal reform that eliminated the corporate status of indigenous communities, indigenous communities had a protected status.

Although the crown recognized the political structures and the ruling elites in the civil sphere, in the religious sphere indigenous men were banned from the Christian priesthood, following an early Franciscan experiment that included fray [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] at the Colegio de Santa Cruz Tlatelolco to train such a group. Mendicants of the [[Franciscan]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], and Augustinian orders initially evangelized indigenous in their own communities in what is often called the "spiritual conquest".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ricard, ''The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico'', translated by Lesley Byrd Simpson. Berkeley: University of California Press 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later on the northern frontiers where nomadic indigenous groups had no fixed settlements, the Spanish created missions and settled indigenous populations in these complexes. The [[Jesuits]] were prominent in this enterprise until their expulsion from Spanish America in 1767. Catholicism with particular local aspects was the only permissible religion in the colonial era.

===Independence to the Mexican Revolution===
[[File:Flag_of_Mexico_(1823-1864,_1867-1893).svg|thumb|left|Flag of the Mexican republic]]
[[File:Mexico_1832,_Region_Comanche.PNG|thumb|Comanchería in the 19th century]]
The insurgency against the [[Spanish Empire]] was a decade-long struggle ending in 1821, in which indigenous peoples participated for their own motivations.&lt;ref&gt;Van Young, Eric. ''The Other Rebellion: Popular Violence, Ideology, and the Mexican Struggle for Independence''. Stanford University Press 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; When New Spain became independent, the new country was named after its capital city, [[Mexico City]]. The new flag of the country had at its center a symbol of the Aztecs, an eagle perched on a nopal cactus. Mexico declared the abolition of black slavery in 1829 and the equality of all citizens under the law. Indigenous communities continued to have rights as corporations to maintain land holdings until the liberal [[La Reforma|Reforma]].  Some indigenous individuals integrated into the Mexican society, like [[Benito Juárez]] of [[Zapotec people|Zapotec]] ethnicity, the first indigenous president of a country in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=2013 |title=Seminario sobre Participación y políticas públicas para pueblos indígenas |publisher=Cdi.gob.mx |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a political liberal, however, Juárez supported the removal of protections of indigenous community corporate land holding. 

In the arid North of Mexico, indigenous peoples, such as the [[Comanche]] and [[Apache]], who had acquired the horse, were able to wage [[Comanche–Mexico Wars|successful warfare]] against the Mexican state. The Comanche controlled considerable territory, called the [[Comancheria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hämäläinen |first= Pekka |title= The Comanche Empire |year= 2008 |publisher= Yale University Press |isbn= 978-0-300-12654-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yaqui]] also had a long tradition of [[Yaqui Wars|resistance]], with the late nineteenth-century leader [[Cajemé]] being prominent. The [[Mayo people|Mayo]] joined their Yaqui neighbors in rebellion after 1867.

In Yucatan, Mayas waged a protracted war against local Mexican control in the [[Caste War of Yucatán]], which was most intensely fought in 1847, but lasted until 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Rugeley, ''Yucatan's Maya Peasantry and the Origins of the Caste War'' (San Antonio, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===

The greatest change came about as a result of the [[Mexican Revolution]], a violent social and cultural movement that defined 20th century Mexico. The Revolution produced a national sentiment that the indigenous peoples were the foundation of Mexican society. Several prominent artists promoted the "Indigenous Sentiment" (''sentimiento indigenista'') of the country, including [[Frida Kahlo]], and [[Diego Rivera]]. Throughout the twentieth century, the government established bilingual education in certain indigenous communities and published free bilingual textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=177 |title=Programa Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas 2001–2006 |publisher=Cdi.gob.mx |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states of the federation appropriated an indigenous inheritance in order to reinforce their identity.&lt;ref&gt;Hamnett, Brian (1999) ''A Concise History of Mexico'', Cambridge University Press, UK, p. 3, "... the Maya inheritance has been appropriated by the national states to reinforce their historical identity and legitimacy."&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the official recognition of the indigenous peoples, the economic underdevelopment of the communities, accentuated by the crises of the 1980s and 1990s, has not allowed for the social and cultural development of most indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/public/spanish/bureau/inst/papers/1997/dp92/index.htm Pobreza y patrones de exclusión social en México] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403132402/http://www.ilo.org/public/spanish/bureau/inst/papers/1997/dp92/index.htm |date=April 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of indigenous Mexicans have emigrated to urban centers in Mexico as well as in the United States. In Los Angeles, for example, the Mexican government has established electronic access to some of the consular services provided in Spanish as well as [[Zapotec language|Zapotec]] and [[Mixe language|Mixe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicadigital.com.mx/IMG/pdf/PD_11.pdf Oaxaca se moderniza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202004919/http://www.politicadigital.com.mx/IMG/pdf/PD_11.pdf |date=2007-02-02 }}, p. 56, "Se trata de una terminal de cómputo, parecida a un cajero automático, que en español, mixe y zapoteco ofrece el servicio de..."&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Maya peoples of [[Chiapas]] have revolted, demanding better social and economic opportunities, requests voiced by the [[EZLN]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

The [[Chiapas conflict]] of 1994 led to collaboration between the Mexican government and the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]], an indigenous political group.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt; This large movement generated international media attention and united many indigenous groups.&lt;ref name=Stavenhagen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stavenhagen|first1=R|title=Politics, Identity, and Mexico's Indigenous Rights Movements|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|date=November 2011|volume=33|issue=4|pages=1169–1176|doi=10.1353/hrq.2011.0063}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the [[San Andrés Accords|San Andrés Larráinzar Accords]] were negotiated between the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Mexican government.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt; The San Andres accords were the first time that indigenous rights were acknowledged by the Mexican government.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt;

The government has made certain legislative changes to promote the development of the rural and indigenous communities and the preservation and promotion of their languages. The second article of the Constitution was modified to grant them the right of self-determination and requires state governments to promote and ensure the economic development of the indigenous communities as well as the preservation of their languages and traditions.

==Rights of indigenous peoples==

===List of rights===
The Spanish crown had legal protections of indigenous as individuals as well as their communities, including establishing a separate General Indian Court.&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Borah, ''Justice by Insurance: The General Indian court of Colonial Mexico and the Legal Aides of the Half-Real''. Berkeley: University of California Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-nineteenth century liberal reform removed those, so that there was equality of individuals before Mexican law.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Mexican Liberalism in the Age of Mora''&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation of a national identity not linked to racial or ethnic identity was an aim of Mexican liberalism.

In the late twentieth century there has been a push for indigenous rights and a recognition of indigenous cultural identity. 
According to the constitutional reform of 2001, the following rights of indigenous peoples are recognized:&lt;ref name="cdi faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=272&amp;Itemid=58|title=Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas - México|website=Cdi.gob.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* acknowledgement as indigenous communities, right to self-ascription, and the application of their own regulatory systems
* preservation of their cultural identity, land, consultation and participation
* access to the jurisdiction to the state and to development
* recognition of indigenous peoples and communities as subject of public law
* self-determination and self-autonomy
* [[remunicipalization]] for the advancement of indigenous communities 
* administer own forms of communication and media

===Land rights===

During the early colonial era in central Mexico, Spaniards were more interested in having access to indigenous labor than in ownership of land. The institution of the [[encomienda]], a crown grant of the labor of particular indigenous communities to individuals was a key element of the imposition of Spanish rule, with the land tenure of indigenous communities continuing largely in its preconquest form.   The Spanish crown initially kept intact the indigenous sociopolitical system of local rulers and land tenure, with the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] eliminating the superstructure of rule, replacing it with Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The crown had several concerns about the encomienda.  First was that the holders of encomiendas, called ''encomenderos'' were becoming too powerful, essentially a seigneurial group that might challenge crown power (as shown in the conspiracy by conqueror [[Hernán Cortés]]'s legitimate son and heir). Second was that the encomenderos were monopolizing indigenous labor to the exclusion of newly arriving Spaniards. And third, the crown was concerned about the damage to the indigenous vassals of the crown and their communities by the institution. Through the New Laws of 1542, the crown sought to phase out the encomienda and replace it with another crown mechanism of forced indigenous labor, known as the [[repartimiento]]. Indigenous labor was no longer monopolized by a small group of privileged encomienda holders, but rather labor was apportioned to a larger group of Spaniards. Natives performed low-paid or underpaid labor for a certain number of weeks or months on Spanish enterprises.&lt;ref name=Cuello&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuello|first1=J|title=The Persistence of Indian Slavery and Encomienda in the Northeast of Colonial Mexico, 1577-1723|journal=Journal of Social History|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land of indigenous peoples is used for material reasons as well as spiritual reasons. Religious, cultural, social, spiritual, and other events relating to their identity are also tied to the land.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaona Pando|first1=Georgina|title=EL DERECHO A LA TIERRA Y PROTECCIÓN DEL MEDIO AMBIENTE POR LOS PUEBLOS INDÍGENAS|journal=Nueva Antropología: Revista de Ciencias Sociales|date=June 2013|volume=26|issue=78|pages=141–161|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous people use collective property so that the aforementioned services that the land provides are available to the entire community and future generations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This was a stark contrast to the viewpoints of colonists that saw the land purely in an economic way where land could be transferred between individuals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Once the land of the indigenous people and therefore their livelihood was taken from them, they became dependent on those that had land and power.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Additionally, the spiritual services that the land provided were no longer available and caused a deterioration of indigenous groups and cultures.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Colonial-era racial categories and post-independence===
The Spanish legal system divided racial groups into two basic categories, the ''República de Españoles'', consisting of all non-indigenous but initially white Spaniards and black Africans, and the ''República de Indios''. As there was greater intermixture and resulting offspring, a more formal [[casta]] system came into place, with specific terms for different racial mixtures. This system gave more political and social power to Spaniards so that Indigenous people and blacks could be kept in lower positions.&lt;ref name=Bustamante&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bustamante|first1=A|title=The Matter Was Never Resolved: The 'casta' system in colonial New Mexico|journal=New Mexico Historical Review|date=1991|volume=66|issue=2|pages=143–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ethnic origins of the person were not known, phenotypic characteristics were relied upon to determine the status of the individual.&lt;ref name="Bustamante"/&gt; Those that were in lower statuses had to pay more to the crown.&lt;ref name="Bustamante"/&gt;

When Mexico gained independence in 1821, the casta system was eliminated as a legal structure, but racial divides remained.  
White Mexican argued about what the solution was to the ''Indian Problem'', that is indigenous who continued to live in communities and were not integrated politically or socially as citizens of the new republic.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Hale, ''Mexican Liberalism in the Age of Mora, 1821-1853''. New Haven: Yale University Press 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mexican constitution of 1824 has several articles pertaining to indigenous peoples.  The second article of the [[constitution of Mexico]] recognizes and enforces the right of indigenous peoples and communities to self-determination and therefore their autonomy to:

V. Preserve and improve their habitat as well as preserve the integrity of their lands in accordance with this constitution.
VI. Be entitled to the estate and land property modalities established by this constitution and its derived legislation, to all private property rights and communal property rights as well as to use and enjoy in a preferential way all the natural resources located at the places which the communities live in, except those defined as strategic areas according to the constitution. The communities shall be authorized to associate with each other in order to achieve such goals.&lt;ref name="juridicas.unam.mx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/infjur/leg/constmex/pdf/consting.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218091702/http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/infjur/leg/constmex/pdf/consting.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 February 2015|title=Wayback Machine|date=18 February 2015|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Mexican government, some indigenous people had land rights under [[ejido]] and agrarian communities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Derek|title=The Certification and Privatization of Indigenous Lands in Mexico|journal=Journal of Latin American Geography|date=2009|volume=8|issue=2|pages=175–207|doi=10.1353/lag.0.0060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under ejidos, indigenous communities have usufruct rights of the land. Indigenous communities choose to do this when they do not have the legal evidence to claim the land. In 1992, shifts were made to the economic structure and ejidos could now be partitioned and sold. For this to happen, the PROCEDE program was established. The PROCEDE program surveyed, mapped, and verified the ejido lands. This privatization of land undermined the economic base of the indigenous communities much like the taking of their land during colonization.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Linguistic rights===
The history of [[linguistic rights]] in Mexico began when Spanish first made contact with Indigenous Languages during the colonial period.&lt;ref name="Hidalgo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hidalgo|first1=ed. by Margarita|editor1-last=Hidalgo|editor1-first=Margarita|title=Mexican indigenous languages at the dawn of the twenty-first century|date=2006|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=3110185970}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early sixteenth century [[mestizaje]], mixing of races of culture, led to mixing of languages as well.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt;
The [[Spanish Crown]] proclaimed Spanish to be the language of the empire; however, indigenous languages were used during conversion of individuals to Catholicism.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt; Because of this, indigenous languages were more widespread than Spanish from 1523-1581.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt; During the late sixteenth century, the status of Spanish language increased.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt;

By the seventeenth century, the elite minority were Spanish speakers.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt;
After independence in 1821 there was a shift to Spanish to legitimize the Mexican Spanish created by the Mexican criollos.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt; Since then, indigenous tongues were discriminated against and seen as not modern.&lt;ref name="Canuto Castillo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Canuto Castillo|first1=Felipe|title=LAS LENGUAS INDÍGENAS EN EL MéXICO DE HOY: POLÍTICA Y REALIDAD LINGÜÍSTICAS|journal=Lenguas Modernas|date=June 2013|volume=42|pages=31–45|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The nineteenth century brought with it programs to provide [[bilingual education]] at [[Primary School|primary levels]] where they would eventually transition to Spanish only education.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt; Linguistic uniformity was sought out to strengthen national identity; however, this left indigenous languages out of power structures.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt;

[[File:Zapatista sign.jpg|thumb|Sign indicating the entrance of Zapatista rebel territory. "You are in Zapatista territory in rebellion. Here the people command and the government obeys".]]

The [[Chiapas conflict]] of 1994 led to collaboration between the Mexican government and the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]], an indigenous political group.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt; In 1996 the [[San Andrés Accords|San Andrés Larráinzar Accords]] were negotiated between the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Mexican government.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt; The San Andres accords were the first time that indigenous rights were acknowledged by the Mexican government.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt; The San Andres Accords did not explicitly state language but language was involved in matters involving culture and education.&lt;ref name=Hidalgo /&gt;

In 2001, the [[constitution of Mexico]] was changed to acknowledge indigenous peoples and grant them protection. The second article of the constitution of Mexico recognizes and enforces the right of indigenous peoples and communities to self-determination and therefore their autonomy to:

* Preserve and enrich their language, knowledge, and every part of their culture and identity.&lt;ref name="juridicas.unam.mx"/&gt;

In 2003, the [[Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas|General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples]] explicitly stated the protection of individual and collective linguistic rights of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Ley General 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=220917|language=Spanish|title= Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final section also sanctioned the creation of a [[Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas|National Institute for Indigenous Languages (INALI)]] whose purpose is to promote the growth of indigenous languages in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Ley General 2003" /&gt;

However, there has been a lack of enforcement of the law. For example, the General Law on Linguistic Rights of Indigenous People guarantees the right to a trial in the language of indigenous peoples with someone who understands their culture.&lt;ref name="Ley General 2003" /&gt; According to the [[National Human Rights Commission (Mexico)]], Mexico has not abided by this law.&lt;ref name="Canuto Castillo" /&gt; Examples of this include [[Santiago Mexquititlán raid|Jacinta Francisca Marcial]], an indigenous woman who was imprisoned for kidnapping in 2006.&lt;ref name="Canuto Castillo" /&gt; After three years and the assistance of [[Amnesty International]] she was released for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name="Canuto Castillo" /&gt;

Additionally, the General Law on Linguistics also guarantees bilingual and intercultural education.&lt;ref name="Ley General 2003" /&gt; However, it is a common complaint that teachers do not know the indigenous language or do not prioritize teaching the indigenous language.&lt;ref name="Canuto Castillo" /&gt; In fact, some studies argue that formal education has decreased the prevalence of indigenous languages.&lt;ref name="Canuto Castillo" /&gt;

Some parents do not teach their children their indigenous language and some children refuse to learn their indigenous language for fear that they will be discriminated against. Scholars argue that there needs to be a social change to elevate the status of indigenous languages in order for the law to be withheld so that indigenous languages are protected.&lt;ref name="Canuto Castillo" /&gt;

===Rights of indigenous women===
Indigenous women are often taken advantage of because they are women, indigenous, and often poor.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Cami|title=The Struggle for Women's Rights|journal=DePaul Journal for Social Science|volume=5|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous culture has been used as a pretext for Mexican government to enact laws that deny human rights to women such as the right to own land.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; Additionally, violence against women has been regarded by the Mexican government as a cultural practice.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt;  The government has enforced impunity of the exploitation of indigenous women by its own government{{clarify|date=December 2015}} including by the military.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt;

The [[EZLN]] accepted a Revolutionary Law for Women on March 8, 1993.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; The law is not fully enforced but shows solidarity between the indigenous movement and women.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt;  The Mexican government has increased militarization of indigenous areas which makes women more susceptible to harassment through military abuses.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt;

Indigenous women are forming many organizations to support each other, improve their position in society, and gain financial independence.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; Indigenous women use national and international legislation to support their claims that go against cultural norms such as domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Gonzales Montes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzales Montes|first1=Soledad|title=Violencia contra las mujeres, derechos y ciudadanía en contextos rurales e indígenas de México|journal=Convergencia: Revista de Ciencias Sociales|date=May 2009|volume=17|issue=50|pages=165–185|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive justice is an important issue to indigenous communities because there is a lack of development in these areas and is less access to maternal care. [[Conditional cash transfer]] programs such as [[Oportunidades]] have been used to encourage indigenous women to seek formal health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sosa-Rubi|first1=Sandra|title=Learning effect of a conditional cash transfer programme on poor rural women’s selection of delivery care in Mexico|journal=Health and Policy Planning|date=Nov 2011|volume=26|issue=6|pages=496–507|doi=10.1093/heapol/czq085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Demographics of Mexico}}
[[File:Guelaguetza01.JPG|thumb|300px|Indigenous people from all parts of Mexican state of Oaxaca, participate wearing traditional clothes and artifacts, in a celebration known as [[Guelaguetza]].]]

===Definition===
The number of indigenous Mexicans is judged using the political criteria found in the 2nd article of the Mexican constitution. The Mexican census does not report racial-ethnicity but only the cultural-ethnicity of indigenous communities that preserve their indigenous languages, traditions, beliefs, and cultures.&lt;ref name="CDI"/&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main article|Languages of Mexico}}

The Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Languages recognizes 62 [[languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]] as "national languages" which have the same validity as Spanish in all territories where they are spoken.&lt;ref name="diputados.gob.mx"/&gt; According to the [[National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Data Processing]] (INEGI), approximately 6.7% of the population speaks an indigenous language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/poblacion/lindigena.aspx?tema=P|title=Población. Hablantes de lengua indígena|website=Cuentame.inegi.org.mx|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, less than half of those identified as indigenous.&lt;ref name="somosprimos.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somosprimos.com/schmal/schmal.htm|title=John P. Schmal|website=Somosprimos.com|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6,695,228 people 5 years or older were tallied as indigenous-language speakers in the 2010 census, an increase of about 650,000 from the 2000 census. In 2000, 6,044,547 people 5 years or older spoke an indigenous language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inee.edu.mx/bie/mapa_indica/2005/PanoramaEducativoDeMexico/CS/CS04/2005_CS04__.pdf|format=PDF|title= PORCENTAJE DE POBLACION INDÍGENA, PORCENTAJE DE POBLACION HABLANTE DE LENGUA INDÍGENA Y PORCENTAJE DE MONOLINGÜES|website=Inee.edu.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In previous censuses, information on the indigenous speaking population five years of age and older was obtained from the Mexican people. However, in the 2010 census, this approach was changed and the Government also began to collect data on people 3 years and older because from the age of 3, children are able to communicate verbally. With this new approach, it was determined that there were 6,913,362 people 3 years of age or more who spoke an indigenous language (218,000 children 3 and 4 four years of age fell into this category), accounting for 6.6% of the total population.  The population of children aged 0 to 2 years in homes where the head of household or a spouse spoke an indigenous language was 678 954. The indigenous language speaking population has been increasing in absolute numbers for decades, but have nonetheless been falling in proportion to the national population.&lt;ref name="somosprimos.com"/&gt;

The recognition of indigenous languages and the protection of indigenous cultures is granted not only to the ethnic groups indigenous to modern-day Mexican territory, but also to other North American indigenous groups that migrated to Mexico from the United States&lt;ref name="Kikapú"/&gt; in the nineteenth century and those who immigrated from [[Guatemala]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inegi.org.mx1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdi.gob.mx"/&gt;

==== States ====
{{Further information|List of Mexican states by indigenous-speaking population}}

The five states with the largest indigenous-language-speaking populations are:
* [[Oaxaca]], with 1,165,186 indigenous language speakers, accounting for 34.2% of the state's population.
* [[Chiapas]], with 1,141,499 indigenous language speakers, accounting for 27.2% of the state's population.
* [[Veracruz]], with 644,559 indigenous language speakers, accounting for 9.4% the state's population. 
* [[Puebla]], with 601,680 indigenous language speakers, accounting for 11.7% of the state's population. 
* [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], with 537,516 indigenous language speakers, accounting for 30.3% of the state's population.

These five states accounted for 61.1% of all indigenous language speakers in Mexico. Most indigenous Mexicans do not speak their own languages and speak only Spanish. This is reflected in these five states' populations. Although Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz, Puebla, and Yucatán have 34.2%, 27.2%, 9.4%, 11.7%, and 30.3% of their populations speaking an indigenous language, these states' indigenous populations are 65.73%, 36.15%, 29.25%, 35.28%, 65.4% respectively.&lt;ref name="somosprimos.com"/&gt;

According to the [[National Commission for the Development of the Indigenous Peoples]] (CDI), there were 25,694,928 indigenous people reported in Mexico in 2015,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inegi.org.mx1"/&gt; which constitutes 21.5% of the population of Mexico. This is a significant increase from the 2010 census, in which indigenous Mexicans accounted for 14.9% of the population, and numbered 15,700,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conapo.gob.mx/work/models/CONAPO/indigenas_2010/Proyindigenas.pdf |title=Preliminares.p65 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most indigenous communities have a degree of financial, political autonomy under the legislation of "[[usos y costumbres]]", which allows them to regulate internal issues under [[customary law]].

The indigenous population of Mexico has in recent decades increased both in absolute numbers as-well as a percentage of the population. This is largely due to increased self-identification as indigenous, as-well as indigenous women having higher birth rates as compared to the Mexican average.&lt;ref name="inegi.org.mx1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inegi1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/03/30/inegi-cada-vez-mas-mexicanos-hablan-una-lengua-indigena |title=INEGI: Cada vez más mexicanos hablan una lengua indígena - Nacional - CNNMéxico.com |publisher=Mexico.cnn.com |date=2011-03-30 |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206133901/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/03/30/inegi-cada-vez-mas-mexicanos-hablan-una-lengua-indigena |archivedate=2011-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=62&amp;Itemid=24 |title=National Commission for the Development of the Indigenous Peoples |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous peoples are more likely to live in more rural areas, than the Mexican average, but many do reside in urban or suburban areas, particularly, in the central states of [[Mexico State|Mexico]], [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], [[Tlaxcala]], the [[Mexico City|Federal District]] and the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].

===Population genetics===
{{further information| Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
In 2011 a large scale mitochondrial sequencing in Mexican Americans revealed 85 to 90% of  maternal mtDNA lineages are of Native American origin, with the remainder having European (5-7%) or African ancestry (3-5%). Thus the observed frequency of Native American mtDNA in Mexican/Mexican Americans is higher than was expected on the basis of autosomal estimates of Native American admixture for these populations i.e. ~ 30-46%&lt;ref name="http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2148-11-293.pdf"&gt;http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2148-11-293.pdf
“For mtDNA variation, some studies have measured Native American, European and African contributions to Mexican and Mexican American populations, revealing 85 to 90% of mtDNA lineages are of Native American origin, with the remainder having European (5-7%) or African ancestry (3-5%). Thus the observed frequency of Native American mtDNA in Mexican/Mexican Americans is higher than was expected on the basis of autosomal estimates of Native American admixture for these populations i.e. ~ 30-46%. The difference is indicative of directional mating involving preferentially immigrant men and Native American women. This type of genetic asymmetry has been observed in other populations, including Brazilian individuals of African ancestry, as the analysis of sex specific and autosomal markers has revealed evidence for substantial European admixture that was mediated mostly through men. In our 384 completely sequenced Mexican American mitochondrial genomes, 12 (3.1%) are of African ancestry belonging to haplogroups L0a1a’3’, L2a1, L3b, L3d and U6a7; 52 (13.6%) belong to European haplogroups HV, JT, U1, U4, U5; and K and the majority (320, 83.3%) are of Native American ancestry.” [http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2148-11-293.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, indigenous Mexicans live more poorly than non-indigenous Mexicans however, social development varies between states, different indigenous ethnicities and between rural and urban areas. In all states indigenous people have higher [[infant mortality]], in some states almost double of the non-indigenous populations.&lt;ref name="inegi.org.mx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/poblacion_indigena/Pob_ind_Mex.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009152736/http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/poblacion_indigena/Pob_ind_Mex.pdf |archivedate=October 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some indigenous groups, particularly the Yucatec Maya in the Yucatán peninsula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/cedulas/2010/YUCA/yuca2010.pdf|format=PDF|title=Indicadores sociodemográficos de la población total y la población indígena, 2010 :  Yucatan|website=Cdi.gob.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/cedulas/2010/QUIN/quin2010.pdf|format=PDF|title=Indicadores sociodemográficos de la población total y la población indígena, 2010  : Quintana Roo|website=Cdi.gob.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some of the Nahua and Otomi peoples in central states have maintained higher levels of development while indigenous peoples in states such as the [[Guerrero]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/cedulas/2010/GUER/guer2010.pdf|format=PDF|title=Indicadores sociodemográficos de la población total y la población indígena, 2010 :  Guerrero|website=Cdi.gob.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Michoacán]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/cedulas/2010/MICH/mich2010.pdf|format=PDF|title=Indicadores sociodemográficos de la población total y la población indígena, 2010 : Michoacán|website=Cdi.gob.mx|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are ranked drastically lower than the average Mexican citizen in these fields. Despite certain indigenous groups such as the Maya or Nahua retaining high levels of development, the general indigenous population lives at a lower level of development than the general population.

Literacy rates are much lower for the indigenous, particularly in the southwestern states of Guerrero and Oaxaca due lack of access to education and a lack of the educational literature available in indigenous languages. Literacy rates are also much lower, with 27% of indigenous children between 6 and 14 being illiterate compared to a national average of 12%.&lt;ref name="inegi.org.mx"/&gt;  The Mexican government is obligated to provide education in indigenous languages, but many times fails to provide schooling in languages other than Spanish. As a result, many indigenous groups have resorted to creating their own small community educational institutions.

The indigenous population participate in the workforce longer than the national average, starting earlier and continuing longer. A major reason for this is that significant number of the indigenous practice economically under productive agriculture and receive no regular salaries. Indigenous people also have less access to health care.&lt;ref name="inegi.org.mx"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11041">In 1967, [[Iran]] adopted a set of progressive family laws, the '''Family Protection Act''', which granted women family rights ; these were expanded in the Family Protection Law of 1975. The act was annulled in 1979 after the [[Islamic Revolution]] when [[Sharia]] law was re-introduced, but it stands out for having been ahead of their time, particularly in a Muslim-majority country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Hinchcliffe|first=Doreen| title=Legal Reforms in the Shi'i World:Recent Legislation in Iran and Iraq in ''Malaya Law Review'' 10/2| year=1968|pages=292–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, parts of the acts have been reintroduced in Iran, while others are under consideration. For instance the 1967 bill set up Special Courts for family matter. They were dissolved after the revolution, but Special Civil Courts were re-established in 1979 to adjudicate over matter relating to family law, succession and ''[[awqaf]]''. Similarly, some legislative changes have moved family matters in a more progressive direction in the areas of minimum age of marriage, child custody and the grounds on which women can request divorce.

==History==

===Before 1975===
In 1906, the first constitution was promulgated in Iran. A series of laws were enacted in the following years, including in family law.

In the 1930s, There were twelve shi'ite laws of marriage, divorce, legitimacy, and custody of children that were incorporated in the civil code (Qānūn-e madanī). These twelve laws were enacted and revised in the 1930s. Marriages and divorces had to be registered in state registries following passage of the Marriage Act of 1931 (Article 1041).&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/divorce#pt4|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Iranian law regarded women as being in the same class as minors, criminals, and the insane: they could not vote nor stand for public office, were not allowed the guardianship of their own children, could not work nor marry without permission of their male “benefactors,” could be divorced at any moment (with or without their prior knowledge, through the utterance of a simple sentence by the husband), and could be faced with the presence of a second, third, or fourth wife in their home at any moment-with no legal, financial, or emotional recourse. They could not become guardians of their children even after the father’s death. They could not transfer their citizenship to their children; indeed their citizenship was in jeopardy if they married a non-Iranian. They inherited from a father’s estate only half of what their brothers received and from a husband’s estate only one-fourth when there were no children and one-eighth if there were children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hinchcliffe|first=Doreen|title=The Iranian Family Protection Act in ''International and Comparative Law Quarterly'' 17|year=1968|pages=516–521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bagley|first=F.R.C.|title=The Iranian Family Protection Law of 1967: A Milestone in the Advance of Women's Rights in ''Iran and Islam'' C.E. Bosworth (Ed.)|location=Edinburgh|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1971|pages=47–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, two family protection bills were proposed. [[Majles]] representatives, including [[Mehrangiz Dowlatshahi]], presented the bill which would later become law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fis-iran.org/en/oralhistory/Dowlatshahi-Mehrangiz |title=Oral History interview of Mehrangiz Dowlatshahi |work=[http://fis-iran.org/en Foundation for Iranian Studies] |location=Bethesda, MD, USA |publisher=[[Foundation for Iranian Studies]] |accessdate=2010-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324015457/http://www.fis-iran.org/en/oralhistory/Dowlatshahi-Mehrangiz |archivedate=2010-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Female Senator Manhouchehrian presented a more progressive bill which was signed by 15 senators.&lt;ref name="The Feminist School"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://feministschool.org/english/spip.php?article158| title=Reform and Regression: The Fate of the Family Protection Law| publisher=The Feminist School| accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when some of the media presented an exaggerated take on the progressive bill, Manhouchehrian had to leave Tehran until the publicity died down, and possible threats to her safety subsided. As a consequence, the family law articles on polygamy and child custody were not addressed until 1975. Nonetheless the Family Protection Law abolished extrajudicial divorce, greatly limited [[polygyny]], and established special Family Courts for dealing with matters relating to the new personal status legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=An-Na'im|first=Abdullahi A.|title=Islamic family law in a changing world: a global resource book|publisher=Zed Books|year=2002|ISBN=978-1-84277-093-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative clergy were vehemently opposed to the Family Protection Act and its goals. The Act removed a whole set of juridical issues in family interaction from clerical jurisdiction and handed it to family courts to decide. The clergy therefore lost much power and authority.

The law curtailed men's unilateral prerogatives regarding divorce and polygamy. Husbands would have to apply to a court for a non-reconciliation certificate first, and then the court would negotiate between the two parties.&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"/&gt;

===After 1979===
The Family Protection Act was abrogated right after the 1979 revolution. 

Marriage age reverted to 9 for girls. Restrictions on polygamy and temporary marriages were repealed. The [[mehrieh]] (marriage portion payable to the wife) was taxed above the level considered customary by the government. 
In September 1979, a modified version of the Family Protection Law's divorce provisions were introduced and adopted on the 23rd of that month. It creating special civil courts that went into effect in November of that year. It allowed divorce only after a judge attempted to reconcile a marriage between both parties, then the court would schedule to hear the case and make a decision. If both mutually consent to divorce, then they go to an Office of Marriage and Divorce Registration and register their divorce before 2 witnesses.&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"/&gt;

Also, The minimum age of marriage was moved from 9 to the onset of puberty. Child custody, no longer an inalienable right of fathers, is now up to the decision of Special Civil Courts. A 1992 law amended regulations on divorce, extending a wife’s access to divorce  granting women more grounds for requesting a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.emory.edu/ifl/legal/iran.htm|title=Legal Profile of Iran|publisher=Emory Law|accessdate=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
The family protection law of 1967 increased the minimum age of marriage to 15 for women and to 18 for men. The family protection law of 1975 then raised the minimum age of marriage to 18 for women and to 20 for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gabrielsawma.blogspot.com/2015/01/divorce-under-family-protection-law.html|title=International Law: Divorce under Family Protection Law 1967 of Iran|last=Sawma|first=Gabriel|date=2015-01-23|website=International Law|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Source is a blog. Do not remove until you find a better source.|date=October 2016}}

===Divorce===
The right of divorce had initially belonged solely to the husband, but with the Family Protection Law, both men and women can ask the courts for divorce under specific circumstances.

There were seven circumstances in which either spouse could ask for divorce. One involves the refusal of the provision of ''tamkin'', the duty, in Islam, to submit to a spouse's will. Traditionally, this has been applied to women, but Islam states that it must be reciprocated by both parties.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Feminism and Islam: Legal and Literary Perspectives|author1=Yamani, M.|author2=Allen, A.|date=1996|publisher=Ithaca Press|isbn=9780863722158|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kk8AmQeC3zMC|page=294|accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other circumstances include:&lt;ref name="iranhrdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranhrdc.org/english/publications/legal-commentary/1000000261-gender-inequality-and-discrimination-the-case-of-iranian-women.html#19|title=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center - Gender Inequality and Discrimination: The Case of Iranian Women|publisher=iranhrdc.org|accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mistreatment on part of the husband or the wife;
* Lack of provision of “maintenance”{{clarify|date=February 2015}} to the wife as well the lack of ability to satisfy other needs of the wife;
* An incurable disease (mental and physical) of either husband or wife;
* Any addiction that makes the continuation of marital life impossible;
* More than five years' imprisonment of either person;
* Infertility of either person.

===Child custody and alimony===
The courts determined whether it would be more beneficial for the child to live with the father or the mother.

The father was responsible for providing support unless he was deemed financially incapable of doing so in which case the mother would be held responsible. The father was responsible for managing the finances of the child. However, after the father’s death, or in case of his inability to carry out his duties, the courts could appoint either the mother or the paternal grandfather as the child’s guardian.

===Polygamy===
Prior to the ratification of the 1975 Family Protection Law, a man could marry four wives and have a large number of temporary marriages. As a result of this law (1975), a man could marry a second wife only by permission of the courts (with a valid reason to obtain this permission) and after obtaining the express consent of his first wife. Concurrently, the wife was given the right to obtain a divorce from her husband in case he took a second wife.

'''Kabiye''' ({{IPA-all|kàbɪjɛ̀|}}; also rendered ''Kabiyé'', ''Kabiyè'', ''Kabye'', ''Kabyé'', ''Kabyè'', ''Cabrais'') is an Eastern [[Gurunsi]] [[Gur language]] spoken primarily in northern [[Togo]]. Throughout the 20th century, there was extensive emigration to the centre and south of [[Togo]] and also to [[Ghana]] and [[Benin]]. According to the Lomé statistics office, Kabiye speakers made up over 23% of the Togolese population in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Lébikaza, Kézié Koyenzi (1999). Grammaire kabiyè: une analyse systématique - phonologie, tonologie et morphosyntaxe, p.33. Cologne: Rüdiger Köppe.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
Kabiye is one of two [[national language]]s of [[Togo]] (along with [[Ewe language|Ewe]]). In the [[Togolese]] context, "[[national language]]" currently means that the language is promoted in national media and, in the formal education sector, as an optional exam subject in grades 9 and 10.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, David (2011).

==Linguistic research==
The missionary-linguist Jacques Delord published the first descriptive grammar of Kabiye in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Delord, Jacques (1976). Le kabiyè. Lomé: lnstitut national de la recherche scientifique.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by Keziye Lébikaza's descriptive grammar in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;Lébikaza, Kézié Koyenzi (1999). Grammaire kabiyè: une analyse systématique - phonologie, tonologie et morphosyntaxe. Cologne: Rüdiger Köppe.&lt;/ref&gt; which remains the key reference work in Kabiye linguistics.

The long back [[Roundedness|unrounded]] [[vowels]] only occur at [[morpheme]] boundaries.

===Tones===
Kabiye is a [[tonal language]], meaning that pitch differences are used to distinguish one word from another. These contrasts may be [[Lexical form|lexical]] (e.g. ''ɖálʋ́'' "elder brother" ~ ''ɖálʋ̀'' "intestinal worm") or [[grammatical]] (e.g. ''ɛɛkɔŋ́'' "he isn't coming" ~ ''ɛɛ́kɔŋ'' "(when) he comes" ~ ''ɛ́ɛkɔ́ŋ'' "if he doesn't come).

There are two [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s, high (H) and low (L). Six [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] contours are possible on mono- and disyllabic [[nouns]] (H, L, HL, LH, HLH, LHL) and three on the [[imperative mood|imperative]] form of the [[verb]] (H, L, HL).

Kabiye also has [[automatic downstep]], where a H following a L is always pronounced on a lower [[pitch (music)|pitch]] than the preceding H within the same [[phonological phrase]]. Numerous [[tonal processes]] occur once words are placed in context.

The contour HLH always surfaces as HꜜHH ~ HHꜜH (depending on the [[Syllable|consonant–vowel structure]] that it associates to). This is a [[postlexical process]] that occurs wherever the context permits, within [[word]]s and across [[word boundaries]].

There is [[Lexical form|lexical]] L [[tone spreading]] in the [[verb phrase]] and the [[associative noun phrase]].

===Vowel harmony===
Kabiye has [[vowel harmony]], meaning that the quality of the [[vowel]] in an [[affix]] is determined by that of the [[root]] [[vowel]]. There are two kinds:

# [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] [[vowel harmony]], in which words contain either the −[[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] [[vowel]]s {{IPA|/ɪ ɛ ʊ ɔ/}} (e.g. ''ɛ-ñɩmɩ́-yɛ'' "his key") or the +[[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] [[vowel]]s {{IPA|/i e u o/}} (''e-kalími-yé'' "his chicken"). The vowel {{IPA|/a/}} is unspecified for ATR and can occur in either set.

# [[Roundedness|Lip rounding]] [[vowel harmony]], in which some affixes contains either [[unrounded]] [[vowel]]s {{IPA|/i ɪ e ɛ/}} or [[Roundedness|rounded]] [[vowel]]s {{IPA|/u ʊ o ɔ/}}. This process is much more limited, occurring in some [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] [[suffix]]es (e.g. ''è-kpéz-íɣ́'' "he coughs" / ''è-ɖóz-ùù'' "he dreams") and some [[adjective|adjectival]] [[prefix]]es (e.g. ''kɩ́-kpɛ̀d-ʋ̀ʋ́'' "black", ''kʋ́-hʋ̀lʋ̀m-ʋ́ʋ̀'' "white"). Again, the vowel {{IPA|/a/}} is unspecified for ATR and can occur in either set.

A limited number of [[prefixes]] undergo both [[vowel harmony]] processes, e.g. the first [[Person (grammar)|person]] [[plural]] [[subject pronoun]]: ''pà-kpàzá-à'' "they coughed", ''pɛ̀-wɛ̀ɛ́tà-à'' "they whispered", ''pè-wèlìsàá'' "they listened", ''pɔ̀-cɔ́nà-à'' "they looked", ''pò-ɖòzà-á'' "they dreamt".

==Orthography==
Kabiye was first written in the 1930s,&lt;ref name="Brungard_1932_Taakayã"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brungard_1937_Dictionnaire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brungard_1937_Takayo"/&gt; but it was in the early 1980s that the ''Comité de Langue Nationale Kabiyè'' (now the ''Académie Kabiyè''), an organ of the Togolese Ministry of Education, standardized the orthography. Kabiye is written in modified [[Roman script]] based on the character inventory of the [[African reference alphabet]]. An alternative [[orthography]], devised and promoted by R.P. Adjola Raphaël, is widely used among [[Catholics]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, David (2008). The Two Kabiye Orthographies: A Sociolinguistic and Linguistic Comparison. Written Language &amp; Literacy 11:1.49-72.&lt;/ref&gt; The following tables show the grapheme-phoneme correspondences in the Standard orthography.

The [[orthography]] contains a significant amount of overspecification, since the 5 [[voice]]d [[obstruent]] [[graphemes]] ''b'', ''g'', ''gb'', ''v'', ''j'' are superfluous from a strictly [[phonemic]] point of view.

The [[grapheme]] {{angbr|r}} is reserved for [[loanwords]].

===Tones===
The standard [[orthography]] of Kabiye does not generally mark [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. The single exception is the spelling of two [[subject pronoun]]s that are [[tonal minimal pairs]]:

{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="wikitable"

| align="center"| ''ɩ'' ~ ''i''

|}

===Punctuation===
The [[hyphen]] is used in the standard [[orthography]] in order to distinguish [[homophone]]s. It appear between the [[possessive pronoun]] and the [[noun]] in the [[associative noun phrase]], and between the [[verb root]] and the [[object pronoun]] in the [[verb phrase]], e.g.:&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, David (2013). Parlons kabiyè. pp 47-48. Paris: Harmattan.&lt;/ref&gt;
:{|
|ɛsaŋ     ||{{IPA|[ɛzáŋ]}}     ||''he praises''
|-
|ɛ-saŋ    ||{{IPA|[ɛzáŋ]}}     ||''his showers''
|-
|ɛsa-ŋ    ||{{IPA|[ɛzáŋ]}}     ||''he scratched you''
|}

==Grammar==
Kabiye is an [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]] language. The [[possessive]] precedes the [[head noun]]. [[Adjective]]s, [[numeral (linguistics)|numerals]], [[demonstratives]], [[Locative adverb|locatives]] and [[relative clause]]s follow the [[head noun]].

===Noun classes===
Kabiye has ten [[noun class]]es. The first eight are grouped in pairs of [[singular number|singular]]s and [[plural]]s that are sometimes referred to as [[gender]]s. Some limited cross-pairing occurs. [[noun class|Class]] 9 contains [[uncountable]]s (leaves, dust, mosquitos...), while [[noun class|class]] 10 contains liquids (milk, blood, oil...). There are certain other [[semantic]] tendencies (e.g., humans in [[noun class|class]]es 1 and 2, tools in [[noun class|class]]es 3 and 4), but these are by no means systematic. The [[noun class|class]] of any [[noun]] is identifiable by its [[noun class|class]] [[suffix]] and by the [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] of other potential elements in the [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] with it, such as [[pronouns]], [[demonstratives]], [[interrogatives]], [[adjectives]], [[determiners]] and the [[numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] one to five. The following table gives an example of a [[noun]]–[[determiner]] construction from each [[noun class|class]]. In each case, the [[noun class|class]] [[suffix]] is separated from the [[root]] with a [[hyphen]]:

|-

|}

===Verb conjugations===
The [[verb phrase]] is composed of an obligatory [[root]] and [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] ([[Grammatical tense|tense]]–[[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]–[[Grammatical mood|mood]]) [[suffix]]. The [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] [[suffix]] may indicate [[Imperative mood|imperative]] (''hàzɩ̀'' "sweep!"), [[aorist]] (''ɛ́házɩ̀'' "and he swept"), [[perfective]] (''ɛ̀hàzàá'' "he swept"), [[imperfective]] [[present]] (''ɛ̀házɩ̀ɣ̀'' "he is sweeping"), [[imperfective]] [[past]] (''ɛ̀hàzàɣ́'' "he was sweeping") or [[infinitive]] (''hàzʋ́ʋ̀'' "to sweep").

Kabiye is unusual in also having two designated paradigms for expressing [[comparative]]s in a [[subordinate clause]]: an [[imperfective]] form (''ɛ̀zɩ́ ɛ̀hàzʋ̀ʋ̀ʋ́ yɔ́'' "as he sweeps") and a [[perfective]] form (''ɛ̀zɩ́ ɛ̀hàzʋ́ʋ̀ yɔ́'' "as he swept").

The [[perfective]] has two forms: unbound (not followed by a [[complement (linguistics)|complement]]: ''ɛ̀hàzàá'' "he swept") and bound (followed by a [[complement (linguistics)|complement]]: ''ɛ̀hàzá ɖèdè'' "he swept yesterday").

The [[verb phrase]] may also optionally include modal [[prefix]]es that add nuances of meaning: [[Adversative conjunction|adversative]] (''ɛ̀tɩ́ɩ̀hàzɩ̀ɣ́'' "he swept in spite of it"), [[habitual]] (''ɛ̀tɩ́ɩ́házɩ̀ɣ̀'' "he usually sweeps"), [[expectative]] (''ɛ̀tɩ́ɩ́házɩ́ɣ́'' "he sweeps in the meantime"), [[immediative]] (''ɛ̀tɩ̀hàzàá'' "he swept straightaway"), [[pluperfect]] (''ɛ̀ɛ̀hàzàá'' "he had swept"), [[future]] (''ɛ̀ɛ́hàzɩ̀ɣ̀ lɛ́'' "when he will sweep") and [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] (''ɛ̀tàhàzɩ́'' "he didn't sweep"). Some of these modal [[prefix]]es may also appear in combination with each other so that, for example, [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] + [[Adversative conjunction|adversative]] indicates a [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] categorical meaning (''ɛ̀tàtɩ́ɩ̀hàzɩ́'' "he didn't sweep at all").

The [[verb phrase]] may optionally add a [[subject pronoun]] [[prefix]] (written joined to the [[root]] or the modal [[prefix]] as in the examples above) and/or an [[object pronoun]] [[suffix]] (written joined to the [[root]] with a [[hyphen]]: ''ɛ̀hàzá-kɛ́'' "he swept it").

There is one modal [[suffix]]. It is used in conjunction with a [[Affirmative and negative|negative]] modal [[prefix]] to indicate a Provisional meaning. It is written joined to the [[verb]] [[root]] (ɛ̀tàhàzɩ̀tá "he has not swept yet").

The [[verb phrase]] can also be extended by means of the [[suffix]] ''-náʋ̀'' to indicate instrumentality, accompaniment, manner, simultaneity or conformity (''ɛ̀hàzɩ́nàà'' "he swept with").

All [[verb]] [[root]]s can be [[Nominalization|nominalised]] as [[Agent noun|agentive]] (''házɩ́yʋ́'' "sweeper") or as locatives (''ɖɩ̀hàzɩ̀yɛ́'' "the place where one sweeps").

It is because of this inexhaustible weightiness that we cannot let go of you. From where does this impenetrable character come? We can reply straight away to this question. Your character is unique, because ever since you came into being, you have never suffered any outside influences which could turn you into something else.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18059">The [[Karelian language]] is spoken in [[Russia]], mostly in the [[Republic of Karelia|Karelian Republic]] and in a small region just north of [[Tver]], though most residents there were expelled in 1939. Karelian has seen numerous proposed and adopted alphabets over the centuries, both [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. In 2007, the current standardized '''Karelian alphabet''' was introduced and is used to write all varieties of Karelian, with the exception of Tver Karelian.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Birch-bark letter 292.gif|thumb|Text of Birch bark letter no. 292]]
The oldest known document in Karelian, or in any Finnic language, is the  [[Birch bark letter no. 292]], found in 1957 and believed to be either an invocation against lightning, or an oath. Until the 19th century it is believed that Karelian was only written down by individuals; it was not taught in schools.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
[[File:Matthew Karelian 1820.jpg|thumb|300px|Translation of Matthew into Karelian, 1820]]
In the 19th century a few books were published in Karelian using [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], the first known one was ''A Translation of some Prayers and a Shortened Catechism'' into North Karelian and Olonets (Aunus) dialects in 1804. Karelian literature in 19th century Russia remained limited to a few primers, songbooks and leaflets.&lt;ref name=taagepera&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QGqWcZu42hUC&amp;lpg=PA111 Rein Taagepera, ''The Finno-Ugric republics and the Russian state'', p.111]&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters used to transcribe Karelian sounds varied. For example, in the gospel of St. Matthew ([http://fulr.karelia.ru/cgi-bin/flib/evangele.cgi Герранъ мія̈нъ. Шондю-руохтынанъ святой і᷍ованг̧ели матвѣйста, Карьяланъ кїӗлѣлля]) in South Karelian Tver dialect, in 1820, they used vowels with breves, circumflexes, and г with a cedilla: [[File:Karelian 1820 g cedille.jpg]]

In the [http://docs.tverlib.ru/kraevedenie/rodnoe_karelskoe/ Карельско-Русскій Букварь] (Karelian-Russian ABC-Book), 1887:
* Г̄ was used for the sound /ɡ/ (Modern Karelian/Finnish "g")
* Г without a bar represented /h/ (Modern Karelian/Finnish "h")
* Е was used for /e/
* both І and И were used for Modern Karelian/Finnish "i"
* ІЙ was used for Modern Karelian/Finnish "ii"
* Ы was used for the sound /y/ (Modern Karelian/Finnish "y")
* Ю̈ was used for the sound /jy/ (Modern Karelian/Finnish "jy")
* Ѣ was used for Modern Karelian/Finnish ä
* Ъ was used at the end of all words that did not end in a vowel or soft sign, as in the [[Russian language]] before the Revolution

Another example: in the [http://fulr.karelia.ru/cgi-bin/flib/karelslovar.cgi Русско-Корельскій Словарь] (Russian-Karelian Dictionary), 1908, 
* А̄ was used for modern Karelian/Finnish ä (instead of Ѣ)
* Г҅ was used for /h/
* У҅ was used for /y/
* Ӯ was used
* Э was used for /e/ instead of Ѣ in the 1887 text

[http://university.tversu.ru/en/ Tver State University] Finno-Ugricist [http://university.tversu.ru/person/882/ Lyudmila Georgievna Gromova] points out in one great difficulty in these early Karelian Cyrillic alphabets, was the inconsistency in rendering the sounds a, ä, ja, jä, ö, jö, y, and jy. For example, in the 1820 translation of Matthew, "я" might represent the sound ä, ja, or jä.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tverinkarielat.ru/catalogue/id/83 ''Тверские печатные памятники карельской письменности 19 столетия'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet period===
[[File:Karelian tver latin 1930 alphabet.gif|thumb|Tver Karelian 1930 alphabet]]
In 1921, the first all-Karelian congress under the Soviet regime debated between Finnish and Karelian should be the official language (next to Russian of course) of the new "Karelian Labour Commune", which two years later would become the [[Karelian ASSR]]. In the end they chose Finnish over Karelian.

Nonetheless, some publishing continued in Cyrillic. The research into Karelian folklore of Maria Mikhailovskaya Bezhetsky, a teacher from the Vozdvizhenskaya school district, was published in 1925. In August–December 1929, the newspaper ''Tverskaya Derevnya'' (Tver Village), printed in Cyrillic, became the first newspaper ever published in the Karelian language.&lt;ref name=tverlib&gt;[http://www.tverlib.ru/karel/language.htm "Развитие Карельского Языка и Письменности" (Development of the Karelian Language and Writing Systems"), Тверская Областьная Библиотека (Tver Oblast Library)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin alphabet for Tver Karelian (1930)===
In 1930-31, a Karelian literary language using the Latin alphabet was standardized for the Tver Karelian community, south of the Karelian ASSR and north of Tver, with the following alphabet:&lt;ref&gt;[http://reocities.com/athens/4280/tver.htm Neuvostoliiton kansallisuus- ja kielipolitiikka Tverin Karjalassa 1930-luvulla&lt;!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;div class="Unicode"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:140%;"&gt;
Aa Ää Bb Cc Çç Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Öö Pp Rr Ss Şş Tt Yy Uu Vv Zz Ƶƶ з ь ȷ&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Note the additional letters borrowed from Cyrillic: з (/dž/) and ь, as well as the unusual Latin [[Z with stroke|ƶ]] and ȷ (j without dot).

===Unified Cyrillic Karelian alphabet (1937–40)===
[[File:Djadja Rimusan Suarnat.jpg|thumb|[http://fulr.karelia.ru/cgi-bin/flib/rimus.cgi ''Дядя Римусан Суарнат'' (Djadja Rimusan Suarnat)], ''Tales of Uncle Remus'' in Karelian Cyrillic alphabet, 1939]]
In 1937 the government wished to replace the use of Finnish (in the Karelian ASSR) and Karelian written in Latin (in the [[Tver Region]]), with a single standard Karelian language written in Cyrillic. Two proposals were sourced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oocities.org/esaanttikoski/lisuri8.html#8.2&lt;/ref&gt;

*One proposal was published in October 1937 by the Karelian educational affairs people's commissariat, which included the following letters with [[Trema (diacritic)|diaereses]]: А, Е, О, У, Ю, Я
*Another proposal was published by Karjalaisen piirikunnan alphabetization project (''Karjalaisen piirikunnan aakkosprojekti''), and included the following letters with [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s (bars): А Е О У, and also included Ӡ (for the "dzh" sound) and [[Dotted I (Cyrillic)|І]]. Е̄ (Е with macron) replaced Russian Ё. Some of the equivalents to Latin letters were as follows:
{| class="wikitable" 
! Cyrillic letter(s) !! Latin equivalent
|-
| А̄ || ä
|-
| Е || e (''not'' "je")
|-
| О̄ (О with macron) || ö
|-
| Ӯ || y
|- 
| Я || ja
|- 
| ІА̄ || jä
|- 
| Е̄ (Е with macron) || jo
|- 
| ІŌ (І + О with macron) || jö
|- 
| Ю || ju
|- 
| ІӮ || jü
|- 
| Ӡ || dž
|}

However, in the end a proposal was adopted with fewer non-standard Cyrillic letters: it included the entire Russian alphabet plus the letters [[A with diaeresis (Cyrillic)|Ӓ]], [[O with diaeresis (Cyrillic)|Ӧ]], and [[U with diaeresis (Cyrillic)|Ӱ]].

On September 8, 1937, at the proposal of its chairman, M.I. Kalinin, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee discussed the Cyrillization of the Karelian language. The final orthography was approved by the Karelian Regional Committee on February 10, 1938 and published in the newspaper "Karel'skaya Pravda". On February 14, the [[RSFSR]] People's Commissariat issued decree no. 214, introducing the single Karelian language in the Cyrillic alphabet.&lt;ref name=tverlib/&gt;

From 1937-39 the Soviet government used the new Karelian standard language written in Cyrillic in both the Karelian SSR and Tver Region.&lt;ref name=taagepera/&gt;

During this period [[Karjalan Sanomat|Sovetskoi Karelija]] was written in Karelian using Cyrillic, rather than in Finnish.

The effort was dropped in 1940 and Finnish (written as always in the Latin alphabet) once again became an official language of the Karelian SSR, while in the Tver region most Karelians were expelled in 1939 and Karelian was banned there.&lt;ref name=taagepera/&gt; The reason for abandoning Cyrillic, and the Karelian language itself, as the national language of the republic may have two explanations:

* Difficulty of implementation:
**insufficient variety of literature available in Karelian
**difficulty of finding enough teachers qualified to teach in the language
**unfamiliarity with the new standardized language to speakers of the existing dialects which were very different from one another
* Political reasons: On March 31, 1940 the Karelian ASSR became a full-fledged SSR, the [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelo-Finnish SSR]], expanded with territory won from Finland in the Winter War. Some later historians explained this as a "convenient means for facilitating the possible incorporation of additional Finnish territory" (or, possibly, the whole of Finland) into the USSR.&lt;ref name=taagepera2&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m-bF5dKgML4C|title=The Finno-Ugric Republics and the Russian State|first=Rein |last=Taagepera|publisher= by C.

Edited by  Sergeĭ Khrushchev. Published by Penn State Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-271-02332-5}}. Page 871 (biographic note on O. Kuusinen). [https://books.google.com/books?id=SaIkK868enQC On Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Under this theory, Finnish (with far more speakers and a far more established literary tradition) would logically become the national language of the expanded republic, so it made no sense to continue with Karelian.

===Olonets Karelian alphabet (1989–2007)===
Olonets Karelian alphabet was approved in 1989 and it was used to write [[Olonets Karelian]]. It was replaced by the unified Karelian alphabet in 2007.&lt;ref name=krl2/&gt; The alphabet consisted of twenty-nine characters, and it was very similar to the modern alphabet:&lt;ref&gt;Bogdanova, Leena; Ščerbakova, Tamara. ''Karjalan kielen harjoituskogomus III–IV luokku Livvin murdehel''. Petroskoi «Periodika», 2004, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

:A B Č D [[Ǯ]] E F G H I J K L M N O P R S Š Z Ž T U V [[Ü]] Ä Ö '

In the Olonets Karelian alphabet, the letter Ǯ was used instead of the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''Dž'' to mark the voiced affricate. For example, the word ''mandžoi'' (strawberry) was written ''manǯoi''. For the computers used in those days, the letter ǯ was problematic, and in many cases it had to be inserted manually afterwards.&lt;ref name=krl2/&gt; The letter Ü represented the same vowel sound as the letter Y used in the modern alphabet.

==Current Karelian alphabet (2007–)==
The modern unified Karelian alphabet is a used to write all variants of the [[Karelian language]] except Tver Karelian. It consists of a total of twenty-eight characters: twenty-two are from the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]], five are derived from basic Latin letters by the addition of [[diacritical marks]], and the final character is the apostrophe, which signifies [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of the preceding sound. The entire range of sounds of native Karelian words is intended to be represented by this set of characters.

|}
&lt;/center&gt;
This unified alphabet was approved in 2007 as a replacement for the separate [[Olonets Karelian language|Olonets Karelian]] and Karelian Proper alphabets.&lt;ref name=krl2&gt;{{cite web|title=Government of Karelia approved uniform Karelian language alphabet|url=http://gov.karelia.ru/News/2007/04/0417_06_e.html|accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters Ä and Ö are vowels which, unlike the German umlauts, are considered to be distinct and are alphabetized separately from the corresponding vowels without the umlauts.&lt;ref name=krl1&gt;{{cite web |title=Kirjaimet |work=Karjalan kielioppi |language=Finnish |url=http://www.opastajat.net/opastus/grammar/lessons/urokku002.html |accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[postalveolar]] consonants Č, Š and Ž can be replaced by the digraphs ''Ch'', ''Sh'' and ''Zh'' when writing the [[caron]] is impossible or inconvenient—for example ''ruočči'' (Swedish) may be written as ''ruochchi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiedotehniekkua jogahizele|url=http://opastajat.net/opastus/tiedotehniekku/tiekar/intro.html|accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 2014, the letter C was added to the unified alphabet. The letter may be used in Ludic Karelian native words and is allowed for use in loanwords in Livvi Karelian and in Karelian proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Внесены изменения в единый алфавит карельского языка|language=ru|url=http://nationalkom.karelia.ru/novosti/vneseny-izmenenija-v-edinyj-alfavit-karel-skogo-jazyka/|accessdate=2014-08-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820112214/http://nationalkom.karelia.ru/novosti/vneseny-izmenenija-v-edinyj-alfavit-karel-skogo-jazyka/|archivedate=2014-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also a nonresident Fellow at the [[Center on Global Energy Policy]] at Columbia University and a regular contributor to the Wall Street Journal as one of the paper's “Energy Experts".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.paulsoninstitute.org/about/about-our-people/|title=Our People|date=2015-03-18|work=Paulson Institute|access-date=2017-09-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She currently serves on the non-profit boards of Vote Solar, Center for Carbon Removal, and the American Jobs Project and writes a regular newsletter on clean energy and climate called "Kate's Cliffnotes"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gordon is a nationally recognized expert on the intersection of clean energy and economic development. Before joining the Paulson Institute, she was the Founding Director of the "Risky Business Project]", co-chaired by NYC Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Paulson|Hank Paulson]], and business leader and philanthropist [[Tom Steyer]], and focused on the economic risks the U.S. faces from unmitigated climate change. The project was founded in October 2013, when the three co-chairs founded a new initiative to assess and publicize the economic risks to the U.S. associated with climate change. The project grew out of concerns by the co-chairs that the U.S. was not developing sound risk assessments to respond to the impacts of a changing climate. In their development of this initiative, the three founders recruited additional members to forge the Project's Risk Committee, which expended to include corporate executives and senior government officials. Gordon took on this project in her role as Senior Vice President for Climate and Energy at Next Generation, a non-partisan think tank based in San Francisco, where she worked on California policy development as well as large-scale national communications and research projects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Earlier in her career, Gordon served as Vice President of Energy and Environment at the Washington D.C.-based Center for American Progress, where she helped develop and author policy recommendations and Congressional testimony related to the cap-and-trade negotiations, Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and American Reinvestment and Recovery Act implementation. Prior to CAP, Gordon was a senior associate at the [[Center on Wisconsin Strategy]] (COWS),&lt;ref name="amp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/about/staff/gordon-kate/bio/|title=Kate Gordon|year=2013|publisher=[[Center for American Progress]]|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-director of the national [[Apollo Alliance]] (currently part of the Blue Green Alliance).

Gordon received an undergraduate degree from [[Wesleyan University]]. Gordon earned a J.D. and master's degree in [[city planning]] from the [[University of California-Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="amp" /&gt;

== Notable Public Appearances ==
* ''[[Campaigns and Elections]]'' magazine named Gordon one of the top fifty "Influencers to watch ahead of the 2014 election cycle."&lt;ref name="next" /&gt;
* Gordon testified before [[US Congress|Congress]] on October 28, 2009 regarding an energy and jobs bill.&lt;ref name="congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Testimony-Gordon-FC-ACES-2009-4-22.pdf|title=Kate Gordon, Senior Advisor, Apollo Alliance, Remarks to U.S. Senate, Committee on Environment and Public Works, Wednesday, October 28, 2009|year=2013|publisher=[[Committee on Energy and Commerce]]|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;
* Gordon appeared on ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show]]'' in 2010 regarding the [[2010 United States deepwater drilling moratorium|moratorium on deepwater drilling]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="maddow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/37974309/#.UpqOIeKVU80|title=The Rachel Maddow Show|year=2010|publisher=NBC|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gordon debated [[Andrew Morriss]], one of the co-authors of ''[[The False Promise of Green Energy]]'', at the [[Cato Institute]] on April 21, 2011.&lt;ref name="cato"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/events/false-promise-green-energy|title=The False Promise of Green Energy|year=2011|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Morriss argued that having top-down governmental programs manage green energy and green jobs was a flawed concept, driven by misguided economic thinking and bad data.  Gordon countered Morriss' assertions with arguments that the data actually shows otherwise: that government programs (versus free market, competitive forces) have generated new jobs and transformed existing jobs and economic forces.&lt;ref name="cato" /&gt;
* Gordon participated in an Intelligence Squared debate on March 8, 2016. Gordon and her partner [[Michael Lind]], Co-Founder of the [[New America (organization)|New America Foundation]], debated [[Jack Abramoff]], former lobbyist and author of Capitol Punishment, and [[Zephyr Teachout]] associate professor at Fordham Law and author of "Corruption in America". The resolution under debate was:  "Eliminate Corporate Subsidies." Gordon and Lind won the debate by a large margin.

'''Katembri–Taruma''' is a [[language family]] proposed by [[Terrence Kaufman|Kaufman]] (1990) that links two extinct or critically endangered languages of South America, Katembrí also known as Mirandela of [[Bahia|Bahia State]], Brazil&lt;ref&gt;Métraux, A. (1951). Une nouvelle langue Tapuya de la région de Bahia, (Brésil). Journal de la Société de Americanistes. 40: 51-58 &lt;/ref&gt;, and Taruma also known as Taruamá of Brazil and Guyana. The proposal is not repeated in Campbell &amp; Grondona (2012).

[[File:Kolty Nizovka.jpg|thumb|Kolts found in Nizovka, [[Chernihiv Oblast]]. 12th century.]]

'''Kolt''' or '''kolty''' was a part of a female [[headgear]], hanging on a [[ryasna]] at both [[Temple (anatomy)|temples]] as a sign of family's wealth, common in 11th-13th centuries in Old [[Rus' (region)|Rus']]. It comprised a pair of metal pieces, joined to form a hollow [[medallion]] or star that, presumably, contained a piece of [[cloth]], impregnated with [[fragrance oil|fragrances]].

== Origin ==
The origin of the word “kolt” is obscure. As a term, it was introduced in the late 19th century in the course of [[Ethnography|ethnographic surveys]]. According to a version it derived from the {{lang-uk|ковтки }} meaning ([[earrings]]),&lt;ref&gt;Б. Д. Гринченко. Словарь украинского языка, К., 1908, т. 2, с. 262 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; also in West-Ukrainian dialects “колток”.&lt;ref name="AAZ"&gt;А. А. Зализняк. Древненовгородский диалект. М., 2004, с. 268 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; In a Novgorod dialect the word “колтки” means pendants of earrings, it was also mentioned in [[birch bark document]] No. 644, found in [[Novgorod]], dating back to [[Novgorod Republic]].

[[File:Brooklyn Museum 00.74a-b Large Round Basket with Cover.jpg|thumbnail|Large round basket with cover, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
In the [[Kongo Kingdom]], the woven arts were emblematic of kingship and nobility. The coarse filament stripped from the fronds of the [[raffia]] palm tree served as the foundation of the Kongo weaving arts. This material imposed constraints that were overcome to produce varied and ingenious [[textile]] formats and structures.

==Chief of nobleman's cap, ''Mpu'' or ''Ngunda''==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1610 Hat Mpu.jpg|thumbnail|Mpu, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1627 Basketry Cap Mpu.jpg|thumbnail|Mpu, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
The ''mpu'' was a supple knotted cap of golden raffia or pineapple fiber and a vital component of the chief's regalia, which also included a ''kinzembe'' mesh tunic, a woven chest bag, a charm bag (''[[nkisi]]''), a reliquary basket, the double bell, and a stool.&lt;ref name="Moraga 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moraga|first=Vanessa Drake|title=Weaving abstraction : Kuba textiles and the woven art of Central Africa|year=2011|publisher=Textile Museum|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780874050363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Kongo people|Kongo]], [[Vili people|Vili]], [[Yombe people|Yombe]], [[Mbundu people|Mbundu]], and related peoples in northern [[Angola]] and the region formerly known as the [[Bas-Congo|Lower Congo]], the ''mpu'' signified the authority invested in a person elected to an office of sacred leadership.&lt;ref name="Moraga 2011" /&gt; Moraga writes that "it was also a potent cosmological symbol connecting the chief (''mfumu''), the kin group, and the village to a mythic place of origin as well as a specific territorial domain (''nsi'')."&lt;ref name="Moraga 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Volavka 1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Volavka|first=Zdenka|title=Crown and Ritual: The Royal Insignia of Ngoyo|year=1988|publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|location=Toronto|editor=Wendy A. Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types of ''mpu'' hats. The ''ngunda'' (from the root ''ngu'', meaning mother) is an unstructured domed style decorated with high-relief patterns that was bestowed on new chiefs during investiture rites. The ''ngola'' is a taller, conical cap worn by the paramount leaders of the Kongo realm.

Nearly all caps are constructed in spiral form, working from the center of the crown to the edge of the hat border.&lt;ref name="Arnoldi and Kreamer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Crowning achievements : African arts of dressing the head|year=2002|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle, Wash.|isbn=0930741439|editor=Mary Jo Arnoldi and Christine Mullen Kreamer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mpu were designed to cover the spiritually vulnerable top of the head. The Congolese used to the term ''nzita'' to express their belief that hair grew in a circular pattern in this spot. According to Moraga, "The crows of caps are typically worked with a spiraling lattice or openwork pattern that differs from the interlacing geometric designs on the sides- as if to mimic the whorls of the hair while accentuating the extraordinary protection afforded by the headwear."&lt;ref name="Moraga 2011" /&gt;

==Chief's ''Kinzembe''==
The ''Kinzemba'' is an openwork tunic made of raffia fiber. The ''Kinzembe'' is unique among Central African ceremonial garments for having a traceable chronology that spans several hundred years and for the fact that it can be linked with a specific historical figure. Ne Vunde was a Kongo ambassador to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] who died in 1608, shortly after arriving in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="Schaedler 1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaedler|first=Karl-Ferdinand|title=Weaving in Africa south of the Sahara|year=1987|publisher=Panterra|location=München|isbn=3767902702}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is represented wearing a ''Kinzembe'' in a memorial bust commissioned by the Pope after Ne Vunde's death.&lt;ref name="Moraga 2011" /&gt; In 1688 in Angola, [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] priest Girolamo Merolla recorded the following description of a ''Kinzembe'': "The gentry have a kind of straw garment on their sholders, which reaches down to their wastes, curiously wrought, wit their arms coming out at two slits, and ends in two tassels which hang down on the right side. About their wastes they have a cloth girth, which on one side hangs down to the ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cited in Gibson|first=Gordon|author2=Cecilia McGurk |title=High Status Caps of the Kongo and Mbundu Peoples|journal=The Textile Museum Journal|year=1977|volume=IV|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baskets==
Kongo baskets were displays of prestige and wealth. They were given as gifts to notables and foreigners as well as used by the wealthy and elite. These baskets often held prestige goods of great status that were given to the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert Farris|title=The four moments of the sun : Kongo art in two worlds. National Gallery of Art, Washington|year=1981|publisher=The Gallery|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=089468003X|author2=Cornet, Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special baskets also featured prominently in the ritual practice and belief of Kongo peoples.

Kongo baskets were fabricated with twill-patterned raffia fiber sides over a solid inner structure of wood or bark. The baskets' dynamic configurations of zig zags, diamonds, and chevrons arise naturally from a twill or plaiting technique using died or natural raffia fibers. They evolved into culturally significant patterns, which were translated into other media, such as funerary terracottas.&lt;ref name="Moraga 2011" /&gt;

==Parallels with Kuba textiles==
Although separated by time and geography, there are many parallels between the Kongo and [[Kuba textiles|Kuba textile]] traditions. Both Kongo and Kuba art flourished within a hierarchical, courtly structure, and each society accorded high value to the arts of ceremony, personal adornment, and display. They also had in common the use of raffia palm fiber as the foundation of their weaving arts. Kongo and Kuba also share many geometric motifs, sacred signs, symbolic insignia, and types of textiles and prestige regalia, as well as techniques of fabrication.&lt;ref name="Moraga 2011" /&gt;

'''Kuso''' is the term used in [[East Asia]] for the [[internet culture]] that generally includes all types of [[camp (style)|camp]] and [[parody]]. In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], {{Nihongo|kuso|糞,くそ}} means "crap" or "[[shit]]" and "bullshit", and is often uttered as an interjection. It is also used to describe outrageous matters and objects of poor quality. This definition of kuso was brought into Taiwan around 2000 by young people who frequently visited Japanese websites and quickly became an [[internet phenomenon]], spreading to [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]] and subsequently to the rest of [[China]]. 

==Etymology==
In Chinese kuso is called "e'gao" (S: 恶搞, T: 惡搞, P: ''ègǎo''), with the first character meaning "evil" or "gross" and the second meaning "to make fun of [someone/something]." In 2007 the word was so new that it was not listed in Chinese dictionaries.{{update inline|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref name="egao"&gt;Wu, Jiao. "[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-01/22/content_788600.htm E'gao: Art criticism or evil?]" ''[[China Daily]]''. January 22, 2007. Retrieved on January 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Christopher Rea, "E’gao, the main buzzword associated with online Chinese parody, literally means “evil doings” or “malicious manipulation”"; he notes that e'gao's "semantic associations [to kuso] can be misleading, however, since e’gao is not fundamentally scatological—or even, as the Chinese term might suggest, malicious. In its broad usage, it may be applied to parody of any stripe, from fan tribute-mimicry to withering mockery. In a more restricted sense, it refers the practice of digitally manipulating mass culture products to comic effect and circulating them via the internet. The term e’gao may thus be interpreted in multiple senses, as it denotes variously a genre, a mode, a practice, an ethos and a culture."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rea, “Spoofing (e’gao) Culture on the Chinese Internet.”In Humour in Chinese Life and Culture: Resistance and Control in Modern Times. Jessica Milner Davis and Jocelyn Chey, eds. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2013, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The root of Taiwanese "kuso" was ''kuso-ge'' from [[Japan]]. The word ''[[kusoge]]'' is a [[clipped compound]] of ''kuso'' and ''gēmu'' (ゲーム, game), which means, quite literally, "crappy (video) games." The introduction of such a category originally was to teach gamers how to appreciate and enjoy a game of poor quality—such as appreciating the games' outrageous flaws instead of becoming frustrated by them. This philosophy soon spread to Taiwan, where people would share the games and often satirical comments on [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]es. Games generally branded as kuso in Taiwan include ''[[Hong Kong 97 (video game)|Hong Kong 97]]'' and the ''[[Death Crimson]]'' series.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Because ''kuso-ge''s were often unintentionally funny, soon the definition of kuso in Taiwan shifted to "anything hilarious," and people started to brand anything outrageous and funny as kuso. Parodies, such as the Chinese [[robot]] [[Xianxingzhe]] ridiculed by a Japanese website, were marked as kuso. [[Mo lei tau]] films by [[Stephen Chow]] are often said to be kuso as well. The [[Cultural Revolution]] is often a subject of parody too, with songs such as ''[[I Love Beijing Tiananmen]]'' spread around the internet for laughs.

Some, however, limit the definition of kuso to "humour limited to those about [[Hong Kong comics]] or Japanese [[anime]], [[manga]], and games." Kuso by such definitions are primarily [[doujin]] or [[fanfiction]]. [[Fictional crossover]]s are common media for kuso, such as redrawing certain [[bishōjo]] anime in the style of ''[[Fist of the North Star]]'', or blending elements of two different items together. (For example, in ''[[Densha de D]]'', both ''[[Initial D]]'' and ''[[Densha de Go!]]'' are parodied, as [[Initial D characters and teams|Takumi]] races trains and [[Drifting (motorsport)|drift]]s his railcar across multiple railway tracks.)

In [[China]], earlier ''e gao'' works consisted of images edited in [[Adobe Photoshop]]. An example of this would be the [[Little Fatty]] internet meme.&lt;ref&gt;Meng 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Leon Josephson was born on June 17, 1898, one of six children: Ethel, David, Louis, Lillie, Leon, and [[Barney Josephson|Barney]]. His Jewish parents had immigrated from [[Liepāja|Libau]], [[Latvia]] in 1900. His father, a cobbler, died shortly after the birth of Barney, the only child born in the States.  His mother Bertha Hirschfield was a seamstress.  Leon attended Trenton High School and graduated from [[New York University Law School]] in 1919.&lt;ref name=WrongRight /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;

==Career==

Josephson and his brother Louis became lawyers.  In 1921, Josephson was admitted to the New Jersey state bar.  In 1923, he traveled to the Soviet Union.  In 1927, he went to Berlin.  He practiced law in Trenton from 1926 to 1934.&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;

In 1926, Josephson joined the Communist Party (then the [[Workers Party of America]]).&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HaynesKlehr&gt;

In 1929, Josephson was a lawyer for [[International Labor Defense]] (ILD). In 1929, he served on the defense team (along with [[Arthur Garfield Hays]] of the [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] case and Dr. [[John Randolph Neal]] of the [[Scopes Trial]]) for strikers in [[Loray Mill strike]] in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]].  He traveled to Europe for ILD in 1929, 1930, and 1931. In 1932, he traveled to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=WrongRight /&gt;&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HaynesKlehr /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In 1932, Josephson was an employee of the Soviet trading agency [[Amtorg]].&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HaynesKlehr /&gt;

===Espionage===
At some point, Josephson joined the Soviet underground. One of his codenames or covers was "Bernard A. Hirschfield."&lt;ref name=UKarchives&gt;

In 1932, Josephson was "involved in providing support for the Russian illegal (either Comintern or Military Intelligence) ''LYND'', then visiting India."&lt;ref name=UKarchives /&gt;

On August 31, 1934 (according to a 1947 HUAC report–see below), Josephson signed his name "Bernard A. Hirschfield," witnessed by [[Harry Kwiet]] (with whom he had associated in 1929 during the Gastonia trial), on a passport application for one "Samuel Liptzen" with a photo of [[Gerhart Eisler]] (identified in 1946 by former Communist and ''[[Daily Worker]]'' editor [[Louis F. Budenz]] as a "mastermind" Soviet spy).&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;
[[File:My Father(2).jpg|right|thumb|[[Alexander Ulanovsky]] ran Josephson as part of his Soviet spy ring in Copenhagen]]
By 1935, Josephson was reporting to [[Alexander Ulanovsky]], recently ''[[Resident spy|rezident]]'' or Soviet station chief in New York and whose network members included [[Whittaker Chambers]]). Ulanovsky had resurfaced in [[Copenhagen]] to head Soviet espionage ring that collected military information on [[Nazi Germany]].  The Danish police arrested Ulanovsky and two Americans, Leon Josephson and [[George Mink]], following a search of their hotel room which turned up codes, money, and multiple passports.&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Romerstein&gt;

Ulanovsky claimed they were Jewish anti-fascists acting on their own, but the police produced information, possibly obtained from the [[Gestapo]], that proved they were working for Soviet intelligence. The Danes held a secret trial and convicted Ulanovsky of spying and sentenced him to  eighteen months in prison. He was later deported to the Soviet Union. Josephson returned to America.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  Mink had four fake passports on him.  Danish investigators got help from American counterparts, who learned that Mink's passport for "Harry Kaplan" had been stolen by Leon Josephson's brother, Barney Josephson.  Joseph spent four months in jail, awaiting trial.  A Danish court found the evidence insufficient, and Josephson returned to the States.  Later, State Department handwriting experts determined that the signature for another of the four passports ("Al Gottlieb") was Josephson's.&lt;ref name=HaynesKlehr /&gt;  A third American with them was "Nicholas Sherman," really [[Robert Gordon Switz]] (previously arrested in Paris in 1933 in what Chambers later called the "Switz Affair"&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Witness&gt;

Around 1938, Josephson helped steal the papers of communist defector [[Jay Lovestone]], according to Lovestone himself during testimony to the [[Dies Committee]].&lt;ref name=Romerstein /&gt;

===Café Society===
[[File:Billie Holiday 0001 original.jpg|thumb|right|[[Billie Holiday]] (circa 1947) at the [[List of jazz venues in the United States#New York|Downbeat]] club, New York (February 1947) debuted "[[Strange Fruit]]" at [[Café Society]] in 1939]]
In December 1938, Leon borrowed $6,000 so his brother Barney could open [[Café Society]] in a basement room on Sheridan Square, [[West Village]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=WrongRight /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;  Billie Holiday sang in Café Society's opening show in 1938 and performed there for the next nine months. Josephson set down certain rules around the performance of Strange Fruit at the club: it would close Holiday's set; the waiters would stop serving just before it; the room would be in darkness except for a spotlight on Holiday's face; and there would be no encore.&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAobit /&gt;

Barney Josephson later said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wanted a club where blacks and whites worked together behind the footlights and sat together out front ... There wasn't, so far as I know, a place like it in New York or in the whole country.&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Few nightclubs permitted blacks and whites to mix in the audience. Even the famous Cotton Club in Harlem was segregated, admitting only occasional black celebrities to sit at obscure tables and limiting black customers to the back of the room behind the pillars and partitions. Clubs south of Harlem, like the Kit Kat Club, did not let African-Americans in at all. Segregation in the States was relentless:  as Josephson told Reuters in 1984, "The only way they'd let [[Duke Ellington]]'s mother in was if she was playing in the band."&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAobit /&gt;

Leon Josephson represented Socialist clients of the [[Café Society]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===HUAC===

====HUAC 1: no-show====
[[File:Fischer-Ruth-1924-Bain.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ruth Fischer]], sister of [[Gerhart Eisler]] (1924)]]
On February 2, 1947, Josephson failed to appear under subpoena. He would have appeared with [[Gerhart Eisler]], [[Ruth Fischer]] (Eisler's sister), Wiliam Nowell, [[Louis F. Budenz]], and others.  On that date, HUAC produced evidence that Josephson had forged his name as "Bernard A. Hirshfield" for a "Samuel Liptzen" on a passport application dated August 31, 1934, which bore a photo of Gerhart Eisler. On February 5, Josephson sent a telegram to HUAC chairman U.S. Rep. [[J. Parnell Thomas]] that advised, "Unable appear before your committee February 6th, due inadequate notice of less than 48 hours. Counsel advises me such short notice unreasonable and that
I am entitled to reasonable notice. Willing appear at later date fixed by you if reasonable notice given me."&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;

====Nixon's maiden speech to Congress====
[[File:Nixonflyer1946.jpg|thumb|right|[[Richard Nixon]] congressional campaign flyer (1946)]]
On February 18, 1947, freshman U.S. Representative [[Richard M. Nixon]] mentioned Josephson's name often in his maiden speech to Congress:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Speaker, on February 6, when the Committee on Un-American Activities opened its session at 10 o'clock, it had by previous investigation, tied together the loose end of one chapter of a foreign-directed conspiracy whose aim and purpose was to undermine and destroy the government of the United States. The principal character of this conspiracy was [[Gerhart Eisler|Gerbert Eisler]], alias Berger, alias Brown, alias Gerhart, alias Edwards, alias Liptzin, alias Eisman, a seasoned agent of the Communist International ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two other conspirators and comrades of Eisler, Leon Josephson and Samuel Liptzin, who were subpenaed to appear, did not appear; Josephson contended by telegram that two days was not sufficient notice for him to come from New York to Washington ... It is no wonder that Eisler refused to talk and Josephson and Liptzin did not respond to the subpenaes ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I think I am safe I announcing to the House that the committee will deal with Mr. Josephson and Mr. Liptzin at a very early date ... Now the handwriting on this application, according to the questioned documents experts of the Treasury Department, is that of Leo Josephson; the name on this application is that of Samuel Liptzin the picture on this application is that of Gerhart Eisler; the signature of the identifying witness, Bernard A. Hirschfield, is also in the handwriting of Leon Josephson ...&lt;ref name=Nixon /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====HUAC 2: contempt of Congress====
On March 5, 1947, several witnesses appeared before HUAC.  First came the real '''Samuel Liptzen''', accompanied by labor lawyer Edward Kuntz as counsel: both were sworn in.  Liptzen was born on March 13, 1893, in [[Lipsk]], Russia (now Liepinė, Lithuania). In April 1909. he emigrated to the United States. On March 13, 1917, he became an American citizen. In 1920 or 1921, Liptzen joined the Party member.  He had been a tailor and a member of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]].  Then he worked in the fur industry until he became sick from dye. Between 1926 and 1928, he traveled twice to Canada (and again in the summer of 1945).  In 1928 or 1929, he ran for the New York City Assembly.  In 1935, he lived in Los Angeles (while ill). For two or three years, he had worked in the offices of the ''Morning Freiheit'' (''[[Morgen Freiheit]]'', a [[Yiddish language]] newspaper affiliated with the [[Communist Party USA]] and with offices in the same building as the ''[[Daily Worker]]'', founded by [[Moissaye Olgin]] in 1922). (Liptzen called it a "left-wing" and "progressive" newspaper.)  He claimed he had been unable to appear on February 6, 1947, as required by subpoena because of the illness of "the missus with whom I have the rooms," named Mrs. Annie Halland (Holland). He also stated that he had never applied for a passport – despite a passport application in his name dated August 31, 1934. Liptzen swore on the spot, "It isn't my signature ... absolutely not," nor his photo, nor a photo of anyone he knew. Liptzen could not produce his naturalization papers, nor when he lost them due to robbery, nor exactly where he lived when his home was robbed. Liptzen also denied ever "loaning" anyone his naturalization papers or knowing Josephson or Eisler (including any of his aliases or codenames).&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;

Attorney '''Edward Kuntz''' was representing both Liptzen and the ''Morning Freiheit''; until a few years before, he had already represented the ''Daily Worker''. Kuntz described building occupants at 35 [[List of numbered streets in Manhattan|East 12th Street]] in New York City: CPUSA national committee on top ninth floor, ''Daily Worker'' editorial offices on eighth, F. &amp; D. Printing Co. on seventh, ''Morning Freiheit'' sixth, CPUSA state on fifth, ''Daily Worker'' business offices on second, and F. &amp; D. Printing Co. presses in the basement.  Kuntz explained that he had changed the legal status of the ''Freiheit'' from business to membership corporation and that there were some communists who were corporate members and contributing journalists.

Nixon resumed questioning of Liptzen thereafter, asking him how he had managed not to see Eisler in that building; Liptzen simply denied knowing him or having seen him.  HUAC member U.S. Rep. [[Herbert Covington Bonner|Bonner]] resumed questioning of Kuntz to ask him more about the ''Freiheit'' and the owners of the building and corporation therein. Kuntz could tell him little other than the current head of the ''Freiheit'':  "Lechovitzky."  HUAC member U.S. Rep. [[Richard B. Vail|Vail]] resume questioning of Liptzen regarding his alleged telegram to decline appearance.  Liptzen confirmed that he wrote humorous pieces for the ''Freiheit'' and had written the book ''In Spite of Tears''. (Vail exclaimed, "You arrived at the age of 17 and you still write in Jewish (Yiddish)?"  Vail and Stripling resumed questioning of Kuntz, who admitted that for some years up to the early 1940s he had headed the staff of [[International Labor Defense]] (which had a peak of 250–300 volunteer labor lawyers) and was chairman of the legal committee when ILD dissolved but denied knowing Josephson there. (In 1946 the ILD merged with the [[National Federation for Constitutional Liberties]] or NFCL and [[National Negro Congress]] or NNC to form the [[Civil Rights Congress]]  or CRC).)  When asked by Stripling whether he was sympathetic to communism, Kuntz answered, "Most of it" but denied being a communist. Kuntz, who denied knowing Eisler but admitted he knew Josephson because "I used to be a habitue of Cafe Society."  Their joint testimony ended with HUAC's informing Liptzen that he remained under subpoena and was "not excused" but rather subject to recall.  (Stripling managed to work in mention that U.S. Rep. [[Vito Marcantonio]] was ILD president.)&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

That day, '''Josephson''' also appeared under subpoena before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]].  He refused to be sworn in due to the "unconstitutionality of this committee" and refused to answer questions.  [[Samuel A.

====HUAC 3: evidence====
[[File:Walter Winchell 1960.JPG|thumb|right|[[Walter Winchell]] was one of Josephson's public critics]]
On March 21, 1947, HUAC held further hearings with witnesses about Eisler and Josephson.

HUAC investigator (and former FBI agent) [[Louis J. Russell]] provided an overview of his life, from birth in Latvia, espionage in the States and Denmark with [[George Mink]] during the 1930s, and efforts to make the false application for Gerhart Eisler's passport in 1934.  Russell noted that penniless brother [[Barney Josephson]] had made trips to Europe in the mid-1930s before opening [[Café Society]] in 1938.  He also noted that in 1946 Barney was a sponsor of "Spanish Refugee Appeal," a branch of the [[Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee]] (which had paid Eisler funds in 1941 under another false name).  Russell then presented 1938 [[Dies Committee]] testimony from [[John P. Frey]], former president of the metal trades department of the [[American Federal of Labor|AFL]] that claimed that Mink had been involved in the Soviet assassination of [[Leon Trotsky]] and proceeded to insert four pages of transcripts into the record that included 1938 testimony by [[Earl Browder]], [[Benjamin Gitlow]], and [[Jay Lovestone]] among others, all about Mink.  Russell documented Josephson's Party membership and loyalty to the Soviet Union with quotes from his own writings, e.g., "The new Soviet constitution and electoral law are the most democratic in the world" and his dream of a "Soviet America."  HUAC chief investigator [[Robert E. Stripling]] concluded "Mr. Eisler and Mr. Josephson ... are in the higher echelons of the [[Communist International]]."  Russell then showed Josephson's connection to two current Federal employees, [[Sol Rabkin]] and [[Milton Fischer]], both of whom had affiliations with known "communist fronts" including the [[National Lawyers Guild]] (Rabkin).  Stripling complained that [[Martin Popper]] had called as Josephson's lawyer to ask for extension on appearance in the subpoena, only to later deny he was representing Josephson.  (Stripling noted that Popper was long-time executive secretary of the National Lawyers Guild.)  Russell then proceeded to provide his report on the real Samual Liptzen.  Liptzen had failed to report trips to Mexico and Canada to the FBI.  He had failed to report the robbery of his naturalization papers for two years.  Finally, Russell found an article in the ''[[The Forward|Jewish Daily Forward]]'' (Yiddish ''Forverts'') dated March 8, 1947, that stated that Liptzen and Josephson are friends and that Liptzen had a long history in the Soviet underground, for which he was expelled from unions and wound up at the ''Freiheit''.&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NewElectoral&gt;

Alwyn Cole, Treasury examiner, reported that his examination of handwriting on the 1934 passport application revealed that the handwriting of the signature "Bernard A. Hirschfield" belonged to Leon Josephson.  Cole did not find the signature "Samuel Liptzen" as confidently belonging to Gerhart Eisler, though he was confident that the real Samuel Liptzen had not signed.&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;

Fred Erwin Beal, indicted during the [[Loray Mill strike]] of 1929, testified next.  Josephson (with Clarence Miller of the [[National Textile Workers Union]] and [[Juliet Stuart Poyntz]] of the [[International Labor Defense]]) had helped arrange false passports for many of those indicted, including himself, and helped them flee to the Soviet Union.  Beal saw Josephson in Moscow several times and knew him to be a [[GPU]] agent.  After some years, Beal returned to the States, although he faced possible re-arrest and imprisonment, rather than stay in the USSR. Josephson, [[William Z. Foster]], and other high-level communists persuaded Beal to return to Moscow.  He saw [[George Mink]] there several times.  Again he left:  in 1940, he was serving four years in the [[Raleigh Penitentiary]], where the FBI visited him several times.&lt;ref name=HUAC1947 /&gt;

Columnists like [[Dorothy Kilgallen]], [[Lee Mortimer]], [[Westbrook Pegler]], and [[Walter Winchell]] attacked. Within weeks of these attacks, business at Café Society fell away, and his brother Barney had to sell.&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=LAobit /&gt;

[[File:David Greenglass mugshot.png|thumb|right|Josephson helped steal papers of [[David Greenglass]] (here in mugshot), whose testimony against his sister Ethel Greenglass Rosenberg led to the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenberg Case]].]]
According to the 2007 book ''Spies'', Josephson and [[John L. Spivak]] "burglarized" the offices of labor lawyer [[O. John Rogge]], attorney for [[David Greenglass]], and stole papers later published by the Communist Party to discredit Greenglass in his testimony in the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenberg Case]].&lt;ref name=Romerstein /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Majang people''', or '''''Majangir''''', live in southwestern [[Ethiopia]] and speak [[Majang language|a Nilo-Saharan language]] of the [[Surmic]] cluster. The 1998 census gave the total of the Majangir population as 15,341, but since they live scattered in the hills in dispersed settlements (Stauder 1971), their actual total number is undoubtedly much higher. They live around cities of [[Tepi]], Mett'i, and scattered southwest of [[Mizan Teferi]] and towards [[Gambela (city)|Gambela]].
[[File:Toom instrument.jpg|thumb|Traditional ''toom'' instrument]]
== Culture ==
They traditionally lived in small groups, farming for 3 to 5 years, then moving on as the fertility of the soil diminished (Stauder 1971). They were active [[bee]] keepers, collecting honey from hives consisting of hollowed logs placed in trees. They did some hunting and snaring of game and trapping of fish.  They raised the bulk of their own food by farming, animals providing only a small part of their diet.  

Food production has changed since Stauder's time. The single most obvious change is that people are now living in permanent settlements. Livestock was not traditionally raised, but many Majangir have begun small scale livestock raising since about 1980. In addition, they have begun planting fruit and [[coffee]] trees, plants that take a number of years to produce a crop. 

The Majangir traditionally had a very egalitarian society, with no standing political leaders (Stauder 1971, 1972). The only people in official positions were people in the role of "tapad" (final implosive d), who served as ritual leaders.  These were from the Meelanir clan, a group has links with similar-named privileged clans in other Surmic groups (Unseth and Abbink 1998). 

In case of a serious disagreement, one party would simply move away.  There was no standard social reconciliation mechanism as is found in highland Ethiopian cultures.

The Majangir have over 70 clans, with clan identity passed down through the male line. A person cannot marry a person from the same clan ([[exogamy]]), nor should they marry a person from their mother's clan (Stauder 1971, Unseth 1998a).
[[File:Majang NT title page.png|right|200px|Title page of the New Testament in the Majang language, 2018]]
The Majangir traditionally made two kinds of alcoholic drink: one from grain "tááján" (cf. [[tella]]) and one from honey "ògòòl" (cf. [[tej]]; Teramoto et al., 2005).

The Majangir have traditionally used a number of musical instruments, sometimes to accompany singing and sometimes played without.  Their instruments include a five-string [[lyre]], [[thumb piano]], drum, rattles, [[panflute]]. In addition, they play a vertically suspended marimba with as few as three wooden bars, but this is seen as a way of passing time, especially when guarding fields, rather than an instrument for music.

Their vocal music includes singing of both harmonies and antiphonal parts.  Often, this results in two parts being sung by women and two parts by men. 

Changes are happening rapidly to their traditional way of life. Since about 1971, many Majangir have become Christians (Hoekstra 2003 and Sato 2002). Further, since the end of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] in 1991, with its subsequent remapping of Ethiopia by ethnic lines, the Majangir have felt very marginalized politically, their territory now divided among three [[Regions of Ethiopia|''kalil'']] or administrative Regions (Sato 2000 and 2002). This frustration has led to some armed fighting with the government (Vaughan 2003:268).

== Language ==
The [[Majang language|Majangir language ]] is part of the [[Surmic]] cluster, however it is the most isolated language in that cluster ([[Harold C. Fleming]] 1983).  A [[language survey]] has shown that dialect variation from north to south is minor and does not seriously impede communication

The language has [[implosive consonant]]s (bilabial and retroflex), but no [[ejective consonant]]s (Bender 1983).  There are seven vowels, and length of duration of the vowel is also distinctive, such as ''goopan'' 'punishment' and ''gopan'' 'road'. In addition, two tones also distinguish meaning, on both the word level and the grammatical level: ''táŋ'' (higher tone) 'cow', ''tàŋ'' (lower tone) 'abscess'.

"'''Marche Henri IV'''", alternatively "'''Vive Henri IV'''" or "'''Vive le roi Henri'''", is a popular French song celebrating King [[Henry IV of France]] (also known as ''Le Bon Roi Henri'', "Good King Henry"). The melody comes from [[Thoinot Arbeau]]'s work ''Orchesographie''; it is the Branle Couppé "Cassandre", while the lyrics were written for a comedy opera in 1770.&lt;ref&gt;"Vive Henri IV!", accessed 2017-12-10, http://www.henri-iv.culture.fr/medias/en/pdf/0/756_10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At later dates, more lyrics were added to the song.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h5M78YVN8M&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the first [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] King of France, [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (Henry III of Navarre), who had ended the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] and restored peace to France (hence his sobriquet). Additional lyrics supporting either the Revolutionary or Restorationist causes were sung during the course of the [[French Revolution]].

==In other works==
*''Marche Henri IV'' was a common ''[[leitmotif]]'' for French royalty in several 19th-century works, such as in [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s opera ''[[Il viaggio a Reims]]'' (in the finale, when [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] is crowned) and in the final march in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' (and the same march is recalled in the final scene of [[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]] by [[Walt Disney]], since it includes arrangements and adaptations from the ballet).
*It was set for piano solo by [[Franz Liszt]] in c. 1870-80 (S. 239).
*It is mentioned as one of the tunes played in Russia after the defeat of [[Napoleon]] in "[[The Blizzard]]" by [[Alexander Pushkin]].
*The anthem is also mentioned in [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[War and Peace]]'', and actually performed by French prisoners in the [[War and Peace (film series)|Russian film production]] of the same name.
*In ''[[Les Misérables]]'', [[Victor Hugo]] has the character of Grantaire sing alternate Dionysian lyrics to the tune to rile his fellow [[Friends of the ABC|student insurrectionists]].
*It is used in the soundtrack for the television series ''[[Turn: Washington's Spies]]'', when introducing a scene involving French military forces.

== Native title mediation ==

[[Native title in Australia]] has frequently given rise to mediation. If a [[mediation|mediator]] lacks [[cultural literacy]] across different cultures or awareness of parties having difficulties during the mediation due to differences in culture, then the mediator’s lack of understanding or misunderstanding could cause a breakdown in the [[negotiation]]-process.  [[Cultural awareness]] ensures that mediators can adapt their skills and techniques to ensure that they can maintain their [[standard of care]] throughout the mediation process.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book| last = Boulle | first = Laurence | title = Mediation: Principles, Process and Practice |publisher = LexisNexisButterworths, Australia | year = 2005 | page = 81 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- AGAIN, COMMENTING FOR LACK OF IDEAS HOW THIS FITS AUSTRALIA
The concept of mediation itself, in some cultures, has differing meanings.  For example, one culture could favour contractually-based mediation whilst another culture could prefer a less contractual approach.  These culture-differences can provide particular challenges to mediators in relation to coming to an [[agreement]] — given the confusion that could occur over the meaning of words, phrases, technical terms and phrases, not to mention non-verbal communication such as interruptions, silences and [[body language]].  For instance, some cultures regard silence as acceptable, whereas others consider it [[evasive]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book| last = Boulle | first = Laurence | title = Mediation: Principles, Process and Practice |publisher = LexisNexisButterworths, Australia | date = 2005 | page = 80 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

Native-title mediation differs from regular mediation in that, rather than the [[parties]] referring a dispute to mediation, the [[Federal Court of Australia]] can also determine whether the [[National Native Title Tribunal]] should mediate a matter.  Other distinctive features occur: often native-title mediations can involve up to one hundred participants; [[lawyers]] play a minimal role; and rather than making technical [[legal]] points the [[spokesperson|speaker]]s for the [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islands]] people often talk about their family [[genealogies]], [[traditions]], [[Dreaming (story)|dreaming]] and stories to support their claims.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite document | last1 = Baldwin | first = Heather | last2 = Robson | title = Native Title Mediation - A Court's Perspective | publisher = Federal Court of Australia, QLD | pages = 6 | url = http://www.leadr.com.au/ROBSON.PDF | format = [[PDF]] | first2 = David | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928163824/http://www.leadr.com.au/ROBSON.PDF | archivedate = 2007-09-28 | df =  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[National Native Title Tribunal]] does not decide whether native title exists over land in question: rather it has the role of mediating contested applications and applications for [[Damages|compensation]] which originated in the [[Federal Court of Australia]].  More importantly, the parties must [[wikt:mandatory|mandatorily]] attend a native-title mediation unless the [[court]] has  granted leave.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | last = Sourdin | first = Tania | title = Alternative Dispute Resolution 
| year = 2001
| publisher =  Lawbook Co | location = Pyrmont, NSW | isbn = 0-455-21820-X | page = 92
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the parties can apply for the termination of the mediation at any time later than three months after the commencement of the mediation.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | title = Native Title Act | year = 1993 | pages = ss 86B(1) and (2), 86C(2) | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}
&lt;/ref&gt;   

Due to the large number of applicants in native-title applications, the process of mediation differs somewhat from that of other mediations. The National Native Title Tribunal takes a more "outcome-focused" approach.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal | title = National Native Title Tribunal, Annual Report | date =1 July 1996| pages = 50 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In the course of a number of pre-mediation meetings the mediator obtains information from the parties in relation to the claim itself and tries to obtain information from the parties regarding their interests in the claim and any other matters which may have relevance to the mediation.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book| last = Sourdin | first =  Tania | title = Alternative Dispute Resolution | publisher = Lawbook Co | location = Pyrmont, NSW | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-455-21820-X | page = 93
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mediation-clauses and the mediation-process ==

Mediation-clauses aim to ensure that if a conflict arises the parties will [[Settlement (litigation)|settle]] it amicably and fairly by triggering the requirement for the parties to use the [[mediation]] process (as opposed to the [[court system]]).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book| last = Boulle | first = Laurence | title = Mediation: Principles, Process and Practice |publisher = LexisNexisButterworths, Australia | year = 2005 | page = 418 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
As more [[Australia]]n [[company|companies]] realise the benefits of [[Settlement (litigation)|settling]] [[Commerce|commercial]] disputes out-of-court, many companies {{As of|2008|alt= now}} include compulsory mediation-clauses in their [[contracts]].   Such benefits include avoiding negative [[publicity]] that can often entail following a [[trial]], reduced [[legal fees]] and less time spent by [[management]] with [[lawyers]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last = Priest | first = M |author2=Scott S | title = Case Closed: Disputes Head Out of Court | journal = [[The Australian Financial Review]] | date = 22 July 2005 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Contracts]] which could include [[mediation]]-[[clauses]] include [[franchising|franchise]]-agreements, commercial contracts, [[building]] and [[construction]] agreements, [[finance]] and [[lease]] agreements and [[joint ventures]].  Standard mediation-clauses appear on the [[websites]] of [[professional associations]] and of mediation-agencies; however mediators may draft some clauses to suit specific circumstances, for example if the parties [[home|reside]] in different [[countries]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book| last = Boulle | first = Laurence | title = Mediation: Principles, Process and Practice |publisher = LexisNexisButterworths, Australia | year = 2005 | page = 419 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  

Standard mediation-clauses generally provide — in the event of a dispute — for the referral of the matter to a mediator, and make it subject to the [[rules of mediation]].  Further, standard clauses will often specify an alternative if the parties fail to reach agreement within a specified time.  Most importantly, such clauses allow for the [[continuation]] of the contract notwithstanding the current dispute.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book| last = Boulle | first = Laurence | title = Mediation: Principles, Process and Practice |publisher = LexisNexisButterworths, Australia | year = 2005 | page = 420 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;    

Note that the Australian [[court]]s, in {{As of|2008|alt= recent}} times, have declared a number of mediation-clauses [[Void (law)|void]] due to poor [[wikt:Draft|drafting]].  The reasons the courts have [[citation|cite]]d for declaring the mediation clauses void include, for example:

* whether the clause survives the termination of the agreement
* a sufficiently certain clause
* whether the parties agreed to mediate in [[good faith]]
* in complete mediation

Mediators may therefore obtain [[legal advice]] when drafting such clauses to ensure their [[Enforcement|enforceability]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | last = Spencer | first = David |author2=Altobelli, Tom | title = Dispute Resolution in Australia: Cases, Commentary and Materials, Thomson | publisher = Lawbook Co, Sydney | year = 2005 | pages = 293–317}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, once parties have decided to participate in a mediation, the [[majority]] of mediators will require them to sign a document commonly known as an "agreement to mediate".  Agreements to mediate represent an important step in the mediation-process because parties participating in mediation often have different views and expectations in relation to the mediation-process, the mediator’s role and the parties’ role.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book| last = Boulle | first = Laurence | title = Mediation: Principles, Process and Practice |publisher = LexisNexisButterworths, Australia | year = 2005 | page = 448 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

"Agreements to mediate" include clauses in relation to:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | last = Charlton | first = Ruth |author2=Dewdney, Micheline | title = The Mediator's Handbook: Skills and Strategies for Practitioners | publisher = The Law Book Company Limited, Sydney | year = 2003 | page = 338}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* the appointment of the mediator
* the mediator’s [[role]]
* the scope and [[Behavior|conduct]] of the mediation
* [[conflicts of interest]]
* the roles of the parties
* [[confidentiality]] and [[Privilege (evidence)|privilege]]
* the mediator’s [[fees]]
* [[legal liability|liability]] and [[indemnity]]
* [[authority]] to [[Settlement (litigation)|settle]]
* termination of the mediation
* settlement of the dispute
* [[enforcement]] of any settlement-agreement reached

Importantly, agreements to mediate provide both the mediator and the parties to the mediation with a [[contract]] which, if breached, will give rise to remedies for [[breach of contract]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Angyal | first = Robert | date = 1998 | title = Legal Issues in the Mediation Process | journal = ADR Bulletin | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Australian [[government]] agencies, professional and industry-bodies and mediation-agencies provide ''[[pro-forma]]'' agreements to mediate on their web-sites.  The mediator should ensure that the parties understand the terms of the agreement before [[Execution (legal term)|executing]] it.  Mediators should also give the parties an opportunity to ask questions and suggest changes.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | last = Charlton | first = Ruth |author2=Dewdney, Micheline | title = The Mediator's Handbook: Skills and Strategies for Practitioners | publisher = The Law Book Company Limited, Sydney | year = 2003 |page = 178}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Once the parties express themselves content with the agreement to mediate, the mediator should arrange for its signing and dating prior to the commencement of the mediation.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14248">'''Natasha Anne Ryan''' (born 1984) is an Australian woman who went missing in 1998 as a young teenage girl from [[Rockhampton|Rockhampton, Queensland]]. Police assumed she had been murdered by a local [[serial killer]]. Ryan was discovered alive in 2003 during the trial of the man accused of her murder, almost five years after she went missing.

==Background==
Natasha Ryan disappeared on 31 August 1998 after her mother dropped her off at school, and was subsequently reported as missing.  An extensive and exhaustive search was undertaken by police and local [[State Emergency Service]] volunteers.  Hopes of finding Ryan alive soon diminished and police concluded she had been murdered by Rockhampton serial killer [[Leonard Fraser]], who was subsequently charged with Ryan's murder.

In the month before she went missing, Ryan had already run away from home once, aided by her boyfriend Scott Black.  In that incident, she was found after just two days. Black faced Rockhampton Magistrates Court in November 1999, where he pleaded guilty to wilful obstruction of police after he had told officers that he didn't know Ryan's whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/11/1049567877250.html Hiding in fear: a girl returns from the dead], Greg Roberts, ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 12 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

But after she could not be located when she went missing the second time, Ryan's family eventually accepted that she was dead.  Ryan's family held a memorial service in [[Bundaberg, Queensland]] on Ryan's 17th birthday in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/11/1049567848758.html She had everyone fooled], ''The Age'', 11 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leonard Fraser==
[[Leonard Fraser|Leonard John Fraser]], already serving a life sentence for the murder of 9-year-old Keyra Steinhardt in April 1999, confessed to five murders, including that of Natasha Ryan, in an apparent deal with police to avoid the general population in jail.  After being charged with the murders of Natasha Ryan, Sylvia Benedetti, Beverly Leggo and the manslaughter of Julie Turner, Fraser stood trial in the [[Supreme Court of Queensland]] in [[Brisbane, Queensland]]. He has since died in prison.

==Murder trial==
On 11 April 2003, during Fraser's murder trial in Brisbane, police prosecutor Paul Rutledge announced that he was pleased to inform the court that Fraser was not guilty of the murder of Natasha Ryan. Ryan's father Robert said he almost collapsed when Rutledge made the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/12/1050069122488.html Runaway lived only 4 kilometres from her family], Matthew Benns and Miranda Wood, ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 13 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Police had raided a house in North Rockhampton on the night of 10 April 2003 and had found Natasha Ryan alive, and hiding in a [[cupboard]]. It was discovered that Ryan had been living with her boyfriend Scott Black since disappearing on 31 August 1998.  It was reported that for most of that time, Ryan had shared a house in [[Yeppoon, Queensland]], but had moved back to Rockhampton after Black received a transfer with his milk delivery job.  Ryan had been living in the Rockhampton house for six months prior to being found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/17/1050172705212.html A haven became a prison], ''The Age'', 19 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite becoming known as 'the girl in the cupboard' and the media leading people to believe that Ryan had spent most of her time in a cupboard, it was soon learned she only used a cupboard to hide if visitors called around to visit her boyfriend.  The remainder of the time, Ryan freely walked around the house but always with the curtains drawn. It was also reported that she had ventured outside a number of times, but always under the cover of darkness, which included a midnight visit to the beach.
  
Despite the discovery that Natasha Ryan was still alive and the doubt it cast on the evidence which led to Fraser being charged with Ryan's murder, Fraser's defence counsel did not lodge an appeal for a mistrial, and the trial forged ahead. Ryan attended what had essentially been her own murder trial on 30 April 2003 to answer questions. Ryan told the court she had never met Leonard Fraser and did not know the witness who stated that she had been seen in the presence of Fraser before she went missing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/30/1051381997373.html Ryan breaks down as she denies witnesses' claims], Greg Robert, ''Sydney Morning Herald, 1 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

A jury eventually found Fraser guilty of the murders of Beverly Leggo and Sylvia Benedetti and guilty of the manslaughter of Julie Turner. Fraser was sentenced to three indefinite prison terms on 13 June 2003. He died from natural causes on 1 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/secrets-taken-to-grave/story-e6freoof-1111112765812 Secrets taken to grave], Paula Doneman, ''The Courier Mail'', 31 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-01-01/qld-serial-killer-dies-in-hospital/2163974 Qld serial killer dies in hospital], ''ABC News'', ABC online, 1 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
The story of Natasha Ryan being found alive during the murder trial attracted international attention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/12/world/world-briefing-south-pacific-australia-girl-reappears-as-alleged-killer-is-tried.html Girl Reappears As Alleged Killer Is Tried], AAP, ''New York Times'', 12 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2941641.stm Australian 'murder victim' alive], Phil Mercer, ''BBC News'', 12 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/australian-trial-rocked-as-girl-found-alive/article1011934 Australian trial rocked as girl found alive], Belinda Goldsmith, Reuters News Agency, ''The Globe and Mail'', 12 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/11/australia Alleged murder victim found alive], ''The Guardian'', 11 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2003/s830480.htm Alleged murder victim found to be alive], Peter McCutcheon, ''The World Today'', ABC Radio, 11 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her re-appearance, controversial Australian publicist [[Max Markson]] was quick to sign Ryan up as a client, and negotiated potential deals with several media organisations. Markson eventually secured a media deal with [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited]], which was the parent company of [[ACP Magazines]] and the [[Nine Network]]. The deal guaranteed Ryan would do exclusive interviews with ACP's ''[[Woman's Day (Australian magazine)|Woman's Day]]'' and ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]''.

''60 Minutes'' sent reporter [[Tara Brown]] to Rockhampton to do the story with Ryan. Assuming Ryan's story was going to hand them a ratings-winning program, ''60 Minutes'' held Ryan's story until 20 April 2003 in an attempt to take viewers away from [[Network Ten]]'s premiere of the third season of their ratings winner, ''[[Big Brother Australia]]''. The strategy failed to work and ''Big Brother Australia'' won the battle with an average capital city audience of 2.2 million viewers, compared to the 1.7 million viewers 60 Minutes managed to attract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s847494.htm Kerry's losers], ''Media Watch'', ABC Television, 5 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

There were reports that PBL deal that Max Markson negotiated would bring in more than $200,000 for Natasha Ryan, prompting a discussion about the ethics of Ryan accepting the money when so much time, effort and money was spent on the search for her, and the police investigation.  Rockhampton [[State Emergency Service|SES]] volunteer Lyle Dobbs expressed his view that any profit Ryan gained from her interviews should go back to Queensland taxpayers who funded the search which came at significant cost to police and a lot of effort from SES volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2003-04-16/ses-says-natasha-ryan-should-repay-taxpayers/1837338 SES says Natasha Ryan should repay taxpayers], ''ABC News'', ABC online, 16 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The PBL contract was eventually produced in court proceedings in 2006, which finally confirmed the figure of what PBL paid for the interviews at $120,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/apn-ryan-sold-tale-for/65283 Ryan sold tale for $120,000], ''The Morning Bulletin'', 1 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Natasha Ryan and Scott Black were married in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/cupboard-girl-natasha-weds/story-e6freoof-1111117607865 Cupboard girl Natasha Ryan marries the man who hid her], Hannah Davies, ''The Courier Mail'', 29 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  It's believed that prior to their wedding, they signed another media deal with ''Woman's Day'' for exclusivity to the stories that were published before and after their wedding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womansday.com.au/real-life/true-life-stories/girl-in-the-cupboard-were-getting-married-8264 Girl in the cupboard: We're getting married], ''Woman's Day'', Angela Mollard, 8 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womansday.com.au/celebrity/australian-celebrities/girl-in-the-cupboard-natasha-i-married-the-man-who-hid-me-3676 Girl-in-the-cupboard: I married the man who hid me], Angela Mollard, ''Woman's Day'', 13 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During the wedding at [[Byfield, Queensland]], there was strict security, with guests screened and strictly forbidden from taking any photos during the ceremony and reception. It was reported the wedding story deal with ''Woman's Day'' was worth $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/apn-natasha-ryans-200000/60967/ Natasha Ryan's $200,000 wedding], ''The Morning Bulletin'', 30 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishment==
Soon after being discovered alive, it became apparent that Ryan and her boyfriend would likely face criminal charges for their role in the false investigation into her murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2945323.stm 'Murder victim' could face charges], Phil Mercer, ''BBC News'', 14 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Rockhampton District Court judge Grant Britton punished Ryan's boyfriend Scott Black for perjury. Black received a three-year jail sentence which was suspended after twelve months after he pleaded guilty for telling investigating police officers that he didn't know the whereabout of his girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/natasha-ryans-accomplice-jailed-for-perjury/2005/08/12/1123353478207.html Natasha Ryan's accomplice jailed for perjury], AAP, ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 12 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-08-12/natasha-ryans-boyfriend-jailed-for-perjury/2079512 Natasha Ryan's boyfriend jailed for perjury], ''ABC News'', ABC online, 12 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Natasha Ryan was found guilty of causing a false police investigation and was fined $1000. Police prosecutor Terry Gardiner produced the $120,000 contract Ryan had signed with PBL as evidence of Ryan having means to pay back at least some of the $151,000 police investigation into her murder.  However, Magistrate Annette Hennessy ruled that Ryan did not have the means to pay the costs of the investigation.  However, in the same court proceedings, Ryan's boyfriend, Scott Black was further punished by being convicted, being fined $3000 and being ordered to pay $16,000 towards investigation costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/apn-ryan-sold-tale-for/65283 Ryan sold tale for $120,000], ''The Morning Bulletin'', 1 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unrelated court appearance==
In 2011, Natasha Ryan's husband, Scott Black, pleaded guilty in Rockhampton Magistrates Court for refusing a [[breath test]].  In that incident, police were called to their home on 26 March 2011 after the couple were heard arguing about moving a vehicle into a garage.  Black refused to take a breath test and was arrested.  He was taken back to a police station when he again refused to take a breath test. Black's defence lawyer argued that Black had been drinking heavily and his judgement had been affected, and was frustrated because he had lost his job as a delivery driver because his licence was suspended. Magistrate Cameron Press fined Black $800 and disqualified him from driving for nine months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/wardrobe-girls-man-faces-court/1086551 Wardrobe girl's man faces court], Emma McBryde, ''The Morning Bulletin'', 31 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nepalis in Poland''' are migrants from [[Nepal]] to [[Poland]], mainly [[expatriate]] workers and [[international student]]s.

==Migration History==
The first Nepali to settle in Poland arrived in 1965. Immigration from Nepal grew in the 1990s' as few Nepalis came for a jobs as chefs in Indian Restaurants and as workers in Indian Textile Companies. A few of them came with families. Nepalis have been coming to the country for further studies, mostly in the medical field. In 2007, there are about 40 Nepalese students studying in Poland though many of them came with hope to get entry to other highly paid countries in Europe and work there. 

Today, Nepalis, along with other Asian groups, usually work in industry, building, services and finance sectors. Most find employment in the central region of [[Mazovia]], the northern region of [[Pomerania]] and southern region of [[Lesser Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.pl/business/artykul127078_asian-workforce-growing-in-poland.html : Asian workforce growing in Poland]&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in foreign investment, especially in the finance sector, IT outsourcing and building industry have brought skilled, but cheap, labor to Poland. About 121 workers from Nepal had managed to get jobs in Poland through individual channel in 2008 and 2009, in 2015 and 2016 more than 3500 nepalese had gone poland through individual and through recruitment agencies according to the Department of Foreign Employment (DoFE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=19424 : Republica - Polish farms await Nepali workers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a nepali student, Tek Prasad Adhikari &lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/tekuadhikari/ : Tek Prasad Adhikari homepage] &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.camk.edu.pl/en/staff/tek/]&lt;/ref&gt; doing PhD in Astronomy at the Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.camk.edu.pl/en/ : Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center] &lt;/ref&gt; was awarded the Young Scientist prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gorkhapatraonline.com/epaper/showimage?img=uploads%2Fepaper%2F2016-12-23%2Fdd84b8a937ac457374b5906ecad23ebb.jpg : युवा बैज्ञानिक अधिकारी सम्मानित ]&lt;/ref&gt; After this, there is an 
increased inflow of the Nepalese students in Poland.

'''Northern Sotho''' (''Sesotho sa Leboa''), also known by the name of its standardised dialect version '''Sepedi''' (or '''Pedi''') is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] spoken primarily in South Africa, where it is one of the [[official languages of South Africa|11 official languages]]. According to the [[South African National Census of 2011|2011 census]] it was the [[first language]] of 4,618,576 people in South Africa, principally in the provinces of [[Limpopo]], [[Gauteng]] and [[Mpumalanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Census 2011: Census in brief |url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf |publisher=Statistics South Africa |location=Pretoria |year=2012 |isbn=9780621413885 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513171240/http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf |archive-date=13 May 2015 |dead-url=no |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Northern Sotho is one of the [[Sotho languages]] of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] family. Northern Sotho is thus most closely related to Southern Sotho (mostly referred to as just [[Sotho language|Sesotho]]), [[Tswana language|Setswana]], [[sheKgalagari]] and [[Lozi language|siLozi]]. It is a standardized dialect, amalgamating several distinct varieties or dialects.

Until recently, ''Lobedu'' (also ''Khilovedu'' or ''Khelobedu'') used to exist only in an unwritten form, and the standard Northern Sotho language and orthography was usually used for teaching and writing by this language community. As of 2018, a Khilovedu dictionary is being compiled in addition to proper Khilovedu orthography which is also in the process of being developed. The monarch associated with this language community is Queen [[Modjadji]] (also known as the [[Rain Queen]]). Lobedu is spoken by a majority of people in the Greater Tzaneen, Greater Letaba, and BaPhalaborwa municipalities, and a minority in Greater Giyani municipality, as well as in the [[Limpopo]] Province and [[Tembisa]] township in [[Gauteng]]. Its speakers are known as the [[Balobedu]]''.
''

Sepulana (also sePulane) exists in unwritten form and forms part of the standard Northern Sotho. Sepulana is spoken in [[Bushbuckridge]] area by the [[MaPulana]] people.

==Confusion of nomenclature with Sepedi==
Northern Sotho is often equated with the dialect it is primarily based on,{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Sepedi, and continued to be known as ''Pedi'' or ''Sepedi'' for some years after the new [[Constitution of South Africa|South African constitution]] appeared. However, the [[PanSALB|Pan South African Language Board]] and the Northern Sotho National Lexicography Unit now specifically endorse the names ''Northern Sotho'' or ''Sesotho sa Leboa''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The original confusion arose from the fact that the (now official) Northern Sotho written language was based largely on the Sepedi dialect (from which missionaries first developed the orthography{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}), but has subsequently provided a common writing system for 20 or more varieties of the Sotho-Tswana languages spoken in the former Transvaal. The name "Sepedi" thus refers specifically to the language of the [[Pedi people]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} while "Northern Sotho" refers to the official language of that name and to all the speech varieties it has been taken to cover.

The English version of the Constitution of South Africa refers to the language as "Sepedi".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/chapter-1-founding-provisions#5|title=Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 - Chapter 1: Founding Provisions {{!}} South African Government|website=www.gov.za|language=en|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its official translation into the language refers to it as "Sesotho sa Leboa" in the article about languages, but as "Sepedi" on the front page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MOLAOTHEO wa Repabliki ya Afrika Borwa wa, 1996|last=|first=|publisher=[[Department of Justice and Correctional Services]]|year=2014|isbn=978-0-621-39063-6|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other varieties of Northern Sotho==
Apart from the Sepedi dialect itself, other languages or dialects covered by the term "Northern Sotho" appear to be a diverse grouping of communal speech-forms within the Sotho-Tswana group. They are apparently united by the fact that they are classifiable neither as Southern Sotho nor as Tswana.&lt;ref&gt;See Doke, Clement M. (1954). ''The Southern Bantu Languages. Handbook of African Languages''. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Very little published information is available on these other dialects of Northern Sotho, but these have been reported:

* [[Lobedu dialect|kheLobedu]] (khiLobedu or seLobedu)
* seTlokwa
* seBirwa
* sePulana
* seKhutswe
* seTswapo
* SePai (transitional between Sotho-Tswana and Zulu/Swati)
* Sebididi(Sotho/Tswana) spoken in Setateng
* Phahladira
* Ga-Monyeki
* Abbortspoort
* Thabo Mbeki villages and surrounding farms north-east of the coal mining town Lephalale (formerly Ellisras)

The morphological and possible lexical variation among these dialects has led to the above assertion that 'Northern Sotho' is no more than a holding category for otherwise unclassified Sotho-Tswana varieties spoken in northeastern South Africa. Maho (2002) leaves SePhalaborwa and the "East Sotho" varieties of SeKutswe, SePai, and SePulana unclassified within Sotho–Tswana. Their precise classification would appear to be a matter for further research.

== Writing system ==
Northern Sotho is written in the Latin alphabet. The letter š is used to represent the sound [{{IPA|ʃ}}] ("sh" is used in the trigraph "tsh" to represent an aspirated "ts" sound). [[Circumflex|Circumflex accent]] can be added to the letters e and o to distinguish their different sounds, but it is mostly used in language reference books. Some word prefixes, especially in verbs, are written separately from the stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/259741811|title=Pukuntšu ya polelopedi ya sekolo: Sesotho sa Leboa le Seisimane: e gatišitšwe ke Oxford = Oxford bilingual school dictionary: Northern Sotho and English|last=|first=|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press Southern Africa|others=De Schryver, Gilles-Maurice.|year=|isbn=9780195765557|location=Cape Town|pages=S24–S26|oclc=259741811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within nasal consonant compounds, the first nasal consonant sound is recognized as syllabic. Words such as ''nthuša'' "help me", are pronounced as {{IPA|[n̩tʰuʃa]}}. /n/ can also be pronounced as {{IPA|/ŋ/}} following a velar consonant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Northern Sotho|last=Louwrens, Kosch, Kotzé|first=Louis J., Ingeborg M., Albert E.|publisher=München: Lincom|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=4–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban varieties of Northern Sotho, such as [[Pretoria Sotho]] (actually a derivative of [[Tswana language|Tswana]]), have acquired [[click consonant|clicks]] in an ongoing process of such sounds spreading from [[Nguni languages]].&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.ethnologue.com/15/show_country.asp?name=ZA&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pitch book''' (also '''pitch deck''') is a [[marketing]] presentation (information layout) used by [[investment bank]]s around the world. It consists of a careful arrangement and analysis of the investment considerations of a potential or current client, and/or a reference for comparison for an employee in an investment or commercial bank. Its purpose is to secure a deal for the investment bank with the potential client.

When an investment bank seeks new business, the starting point is the initial [[sales pitch|pitch or sales introduction]]. Investment banking traditionally adopts a highly formalised approach to making [[sales]] and will follow a tailored and highly effective [[sales]] strategy. If the bank is planning to be a participant and managing member of a share offering then it will make making agreeing to [[firm commitment underwriting]], if the investment bank is planning to act as a lesser participant, involving less commitment, then it is agreeing to either a [[best efforts underwriting]] or "standby" commitment.

Full-service investment banking conglomerates (a.k.a. "Bulge Bracket" banks), will compete to win the business of an established client as either the lead or co-manager of a syndicate. If a firm is less established, the firm, and not the investment bank, will make the pitch to secure the relationship. The founders and management of the business can do this through marketing a business plan or structured private placement. (See [[Regulation D (SEC)|Regulation D]]) of the United States ''Securities Act'' of 1933

The pitch book is indigenous to the investment bank marketing itself to its clients. It represents valuable and detailed marketing material and provides the bank with a chance to show and prove why that investment bank should be considered amongst the wide variety of financing and other sources of capital and considerations in the financial marketplace (and a pitch book will typically go beyond simple comparisons of debt and equity costs and structures).

The pitch book is not to be confused with a public information book ("PIB"), which is an internal resource for the investment bankers to glean transactional and historic information of the intended industry a particular target firm may be in or may be heading towards. The PIB is an easy to access research source, which is usually maintained in the library of an investment bank.

The pitch book may employ a [[SWOT analysis]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats). "Comps", or Comparable Company Analysis may also be presented. In a ''comp'', an investment bank will present industry specific details, trends, macro- and microeconomic and company specific analysis, which will not only support the investment bank's vision but also support reasoning for a particular future valuation discussion for the potential client.

There are many contributors to an investment bank's pitch book. It starts with the analyst to the associate to the vice-president and senior vice-president (relationship managers) to the lead of the team, the managing director. As an example, a table of contents or outline will open the pitch book for discussion. Name, title, and department present a management description of the deal team and other contributors within the firm’s internal wealth of resources. An "overview", "financing requirements (such as satisfying capital expenditures "CAPEX" and capital budgeting)", and finally as mentioned a description of the company's universe, the "[[comparable company analysis]]" are all essential elements to an investment banking pitch book.

'''''Playboy''''' is an American men's [[Lifestyle magazine|lifestyle]] and entertainment magazine.

==Publication history==

===1950s===
[[File:1953 Playboy centerfold.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Centerfold]] of [[Marilyn Monroe]] from the first issue of ''Playboy'', December 1953.]]

By spring 1953, Hugh Hefner—a 1949 [[University of Illinois]] psychology graduate who had worked in Chicago for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine writing promotional copy; Publisher's Development Corporation in sales and marketing; and ''Children's Activities'' magazine as circulation promotions manager&lt;ref name=sumner134 /&gt;—had planned out the elements of his own magazine, that he would call ''Stag Party''.&lt;ref name=watts62&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5b_eM3twmEC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=stag%20magazine&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q=stag%20magazine&amp;f=false |title=Mr Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream |author=Steven Watts |page=24 |website=Books.google.com |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formed HMH Publishing Corporation, and recruited his friend Eldon Sellers to find investors.&lt;ref name=watts62 /&gt; Hefner eventually raised just over $8,000, including from his brother and mother.&lt;ref name=watts63&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5b_eM3twmEC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=stag%20magazine&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q=stag%20magazine&amp;f=false |title=Mr Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream |author=Steven Watts |page=24 |website=Books.google.com |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the publisher of an unrelated [[men's adventure]] magazine, ''[[Stag (magazine)|Stag]],'' contacted Hefner and informed him it would file suit to protect their trademark if he were to launch his magazine with that name.&lt;ref name=sumner134&gt;{{cite book|title=The Magazine Century: American Magazines Since 1900|first=David E. |last=Sumner|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year= 2010|isbn=978-1-4331-0493-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J7g9PgL_No0C&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=stag+magazine#v=onepage&amp;q=stag%20magazine&amp;f=false|page=134|website=Books.google.com|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=watts64&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m5b_eM3twmEC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=stag+magazine&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NZjNTuCxJojL0QGO0cT5Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=stag%20magazine&amp;f=false |title=Mr Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American Dream |author=Steven Watts |page=64 |website=Books.google.com |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hefner, his wife Millie, and Sellers met to seek a new name, considering "Top Hat", "Gentleman", "Sir'", "Satyr", "Pan" and "Bachelor" before Sellers suggested "Playboy".&lt;ref name=watts64 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golden Dreams The Birth of Playboy by Hugh M. Hefner, page 265, ''Playboy'', January 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue, in December 1953, was undated, as Hefner was unsure there would be a second. He produced it in his [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] kitchen. The first centerfold was [[Marilyn Monroe]], although the picture used originally was taken for a calendar rather than for ''Playboy''.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Hefner chose what he deemed the "sexiest" image, a previously unused [[nude study]] of Marilyn stretched with an upraised arm on a red velvet background with closed eyes and mouth open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=rvwH7euUccIC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=marilyn%20playboy&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=playboy&amp;f=false|page = 75|author = Les Harding|title = They Knew Marilyn Monroe: Famous Persons in the Life of the Hollywood Icon|isbn = 9780786490141|date = August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy promotion centered around Marilyn's nudity on the already-famous calendar, together with the teasers in marketing, made the new Playboy magazine a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=xL0cGu1ISVEC&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=marilyn+playboy&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q=marilyn%20playboy&amp;f=false |page = 16 |author =  Susan Gunelius |title = Building Brand Value the Playboy Way|isbn = 9780230239586 |date = September 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=7SUqJZXVWLsC&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=marilyn+playboy&amp;pg=PA157 |page = 157 |author = Gordon Jensen |title = Marilyn: A Great Woman's Struggles: Who Killed Her and Why |isbn = 9781477141502 |date = July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first issue sold out in weeks. Known circulation was 53,991.&lt;ref&gt;''Playboy Collector's Association Playboy Magazine Price Guide''&lt;/ref&gt; The cover price was 50¢. Copies of the first issue in mint to near mint condition sold for over $5,000 in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The novel ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', by [[Ray Bradbury]], was published in 1953 and [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] in the March, April and May 1954 issues of ''Playboy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/10/13/yes-people-did-buy-playboy-articles/73890020/|title=Yes, people DID buy 'Playboy' for the articles|work=USA TODAY|access-date=September 12, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[urban legend]] started about Hefner and the [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate of the Month]] because of markings on the front covers of the magazine. From 1955 to 1979 (except for a six-month gap in 1976), the "P" in ''Playboy'' had stars printed in or around the letter. The legend stated that this was either a rating that Hefner gave to the Playmate according to how attractive she was, the number of times that Hefner had slept with her, or how good she was in bed. The stars, between zero and 12, actually indicated the domestic or international advertising region for that printing.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/risque/celebrities/hefner.asp |title=Stars Upon Thars |publisher=Snopes.com |date=June 22, 2006 |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1966 to 1976, [[Robie Macauley]] was the Fiction Editor at ''Playboy''. During this period the magazine published fiction by [[Saul Bellow]], [[Seán Ó Faoláin]], [[John Updike]], [[James Dickey]], [[John Cheever]], [[Doris Lessing]], [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Michael Crichton]], [[John le Carré]], [[Irwin Shaw]], [[Jean Shepherd]], [[Arthur Koestler]], [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], [[Bernard Malamud]], [[John Irving]], [[Anne Sexton]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]] and [[J.

In 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a "Freedom Trash Can." These included copies of ''Playboy'' and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazines.&lt;ref name=Greenfieldboyce&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenfieldboyce|first=Nell|title=Pageant Protest Sparked Bra-Burning Myth|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94240375&amp;from=mobile|publisher=NPR|accessdate=February 6, 2012|date=September 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key pamphlets produced by the protesters was "No More Miss America!", by [[Robin Morgan]] which listed ten characteristics of the Miss America pageant that the authors believed degraded women;&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/No-More-Ms-America.html |title=No More Miss America! |publisher=The Feminist eZine |accessdate=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it compared the pageant to ''Playboy'''s centerfold as sisters under the skin, describing this as "The Unbeatable [[Madonna-whore complex|Madonna-Whore]] Combination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redstockings.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=65&amp;Itemid=103 |title=No More Miss America! |publisher=Redstockings.org |date=August 22, 1968 |accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macauley contributed all of the popular ''Ribald Classics'' series published between January 1978 and March 1984.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Since reaching its peak in the 1970s, ''Playboy'' saw a decline in circulation and cultural relevance due to competition in the field it founded—first from ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]],'' then ''[[Oui (magazine)|Oui]]'' (which was published as a spin-off of ''Playboy'') and ''[[Gallery (magazine)|Gallery]]'' in the 1970s; later from pornographic [[Videotape|videos]]; and more recently from [[lad mags]] such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]],'' ''[[FHM]],'' and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]].'' In response, ''Playboy'' has attempted to re-assert its hold on the 18–35 male demographic through slight changes to content and focusing on issues and personalities more appropriate to its audience—such as hip-hop artists being featured in the "''Playboy'' Interview".{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Christie Hefner]], daughter of the founder Hugh Hefner, joined Playboy in 1975 and became head of the company in 1988. She announced in December 2008 that she would be stepping down from leading the company, effective in January 2009, and said that the election of Barack Obama as the next President had inspired her to give more time to charitable work, and that the decision to step down was her own. "Just as this country is embracing change in the form of new leadership, I have decided that now is the time to make changes in my own life as well," she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article5310203.ece|title=Hefner's daughter Christie walks away from Playboy Enterprises |work=The Times | location=London | first=Christine | last=Seib | date=December 9, 2008 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post–2000===
The magazine celebrated its 50th anniversary with the January 2004 issue. Celebrations were held at [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Los Angeles, New York, and Moscow during the year to commemorate this event. Playboy also launched  limited-edition products designed by a number of  notable fashion-houses such as [[Versace]], [[Vivienne Westwood]] and [[Sean John]]. As a hommage to the magazine 50th anniversary, [[MAC Cosmetics]] released two limited-edition products, namely a lipstick and a glitter cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/10/15/news/companies/playboy_50/|title=Playboy: 50 years and going - Oct. 15, 2003|last=Writer|first=By Parija Bhatnagar, CNN/Money Staff|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine runs several annual features and ratings. One of the most popular is its annual ranking of the top "party schools" among all U.S. universities and colleges. In 2009, the magazine used five criteria: bikini, brains, campus, sex and sports in the development of its list. The top ranked party school by ''Playboy'' for 2009 was the [[University of Miami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/party-schools-2009-the-stats/index.html|title="Top Party Schools 2009," ''Playboy'' magazine, May 2009.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509091054/http://www.playboy.com/articles/party-schools-2009-the-stats/index.html|archivedate=May 9, 2009|accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, the magazine reduced its publication schedule to 11 issues per year, with a combined July/August issue. On August 11, 2009, London's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper reported that Hugh Hefner had sold his English Manor house (next door to the famous [[Playboy Mansion]]) for $18&amp;nbsp;m ($10&amp;nbsp;m less than the reported asking price) to another American, Daren Metropoulos the President and co-owner of [[Pabst Blue Ribbon]] and that due to significant losses in the company's value (down from $1 billion in 2000 to $84 million in 2009), the Playboy publishing empire is up for sale for $300 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/recession/6007514/Hugh-Hefner-sells-LA-property-as-financial-crisis-hits-Playboy.html|title=Hugh Hefner sells LA property as financial crisis hits Playboy.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | date=August 11, 2009 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, they further reduced the publication schedule to 10 issues per year, with a combined January/February issue.

On July 12, 2010, Playboy Enterprises Inc. announced Hefner's $5.50 per share offer ($122.5 million based on shares outstanding on April 30 and the closing price on July 9) to buy the portion of the company he did not already own and take the company private with the help of Rizvi Traverse Management LLC. The company derives much of its income from licensing rather than the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/12/bunny-bid-hefner-offers-to-buy-rest-of-playboy/?page=all|title=Bunny bid: Hefner offers to buy rest of Playboy|last1=Vancore|first1=Andrew|last2=Heher|first2=Ashley|work=The Washington Times|agency=Associated Press|date=July 12, 2010|accessdate=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 15, ''Penthouse'' owner FriendFinder Networks Inc. offered $210 million (the company is valued at $185 million), though Hefner, who already owned 70 percent of voting stock, did not want to sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/07/16/1588452/penthouse-bids-for-playboy.html |title=Penthouse bids for Playboy |last=Vancore |first=Andrew |work=[[The Sun News]] |agency=Associated Press |date=July 16, 2010 |accessdate=July 16, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=Jennica |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2011, the publisher of ''Playboy'' magazine agreed to an offer by Hefner to take the company private for $6.15 per share, an 18 percent premium over the price of the last previous day of trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/10/business/la-fi-playboy-20110110 |work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Playboy agrees to Hefner buyout offer|accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The buyout was completed in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hefner Completes $208M Playboy Buyout|url=http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/Article/2782377/Hefner-Completes-208M-Playboy-Buyout.html|agency=Institutional Investor|date=March 8, 2011|accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016{{ndash}}2018 changes and brief ending of frontal nudity====

}}

In October 2015, Playboy announced that starting with their March 2016 issue, the magazine would no longer feature full frontal nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Samaiya|first1=Ravi|title=Playboy says it will no longer print images of nude women|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2015/10/12/playboy-says-will-longer-print-images-nude-women/7pxX8hCPsNNLkS9Jgh8uBP/story.html|website=Boston Globe|accessdate=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Playboy'' CEO [[Scott Flanders]] acknowledged the magazine's inability to compete with freely available [[Internet pornography]] and nudity; according to him, "You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just passé at this juncture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/business/media/nudes-are-old-news-at-playboy.html |title=Nudes Are Old News at Playboy |work=The New York Times| date=October 12, 2015| accessdate =October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hefner agreed with the decision.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/13/playboy-magazine-to-stop-publishing-pictures-of-naked-women|title=Playboy magazine to stop publishing pictures of naked women |work=The Guardian| accessdate =October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redesigned ''Playboy'', however, would still feature a [[Playmate of the Month]] and pictures of women, but they would be rated as not appropriate for children under 13.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The move would not affect PlayboyPlus.com (which features nudity at a paid subscription).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/10/13/9523879/playboy-nudity-no |title=The fascinating economics behind Playboy's decision to drop nudes from its magazine |website=Vox.com |date= |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Horwitz of [[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] argued that the motivation for the decision to remove nudity from the magazine was to give [[PB Lifestyle|Playboy Licensing]] a less inappropriate image in India and China, where the brand is a popular item on apparel and thus generates significant revenue.&lt;ref name="quartz"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://qz.com/522672/china-not-online-porn-is-why-playboy-is-dumping-nude-photographs/|title=China—not online porn—is why Playboy is dumping nude photographs |work=Quartz| accessdate =October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other changes to the magazine included ending the popular jokes section and the various cartoons that appeared throughout the magazine. The redesign eliminated the use of jump copy (articles continuing on non-consecutive pages), which in turn eliminated most of the space for cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Karlin |first1=Susan |title=The Playboy Revamp Continues: How The Magazine Is Redrawing Its Cartoon Lines, Too |url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3057521/the-playboy-revamp-continues-how-the-magazine-is-redrawing-its-cartoon-lines-too |website=Co.Create |publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |accessdate=March 12, 2016 |date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hefner, himself a former cartoonist, reportedly resisted dropping the cartoons more than the nudity, but ultimately obliged. ''Playboy''{{'}}s plans were to market itself as a competitor to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' as opposed to more traditional competitors ''[[GQ]]'' and ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''.&lt;ref name="nonnude"&gt;[http://www.wtae.com/money/playboy-enters-nonnude-era-sexy-but-safe-for-work/37812748 Playboy enters non-nude era: Sexy but 'safe for work'] [[WTAE-TV]], via [[CNN Money]] (February 24, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Playboy announced in February 2017, however, that the dropping of nudity had been a mistake, and furthermore for its March/April issue reestablished some of its franchises, including The Playboy Philosophy and Party Jokes, but dropped the subtitle "Entertainment for Men" inasmuch as gender roles have evolved. The announcement was made by the company's chief creative officer on [[Twitter]] with the [[hashtag]] #NakedIsNormal.&lt;ref name="Playboy Reinstates Nudity"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38963007 |title=Playboy brings back nudity, claiming #NakedIsNormal |date=February 13, 2017 |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the magazine announced it would become a bi-monthly publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kelly |first1=Keith |title=Hefner’s son offers Playboy promotions after cuts |url=https://nypost.com/2017/03/30/hefners-son-offers-playboy-promotions-after-cuts/ |website=New York Post |publisher=NYP Holdings Inc. |accessdate=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2018, and according to Jim Puzzanghera of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''Playboy'' was reportedly "considering killing the print magazine," as the publication "has lost as much as $7 million annually in recent years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Puzzanghera|first1=Jim|title=Playboy is considering ending its print magazine, report says|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-playboy-magazine-20180102-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the July/August 2018 issue a reader asked if the print magazine would discontinue, and Playboy responded that it was not going anywhere.

In September of 2018 the magazine announced it would move to publishing quarterly beginning in 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kelly |first1=Keith |title=Playboy stripping down to 4 issues per year in 2019 |url=https://nypost.com/2018/09/11/playboy-stripping-down-to-4-issues-per-year-in-2019/ |website=New York Post |publisher=NYP Holdings Inc. |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Circulation}}Circulation history and statistics===
The best-selling ''Playboy'' edition was the November 1972 edition, which sold 7,161,561 copies. One-quarter of all American college men were buying or subscribing to the magazine every month.&lt;ref name="nextdoor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/03/20/060320crbo_books|title=The Girls Next Door: The New Yorker|accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the cover was model Pam Rawlings, photographed by [[Rowland Scherman]].

Perhaps coincidentally, a cropped image of the issue's centerfold (which featured [[Lena Söderberg]]) became a de facto [[standard test image|standard image]] for testing image processing algorithms. It is known simply as the "[[Lenna (test image)|Lenna]]" (also "Lena") image in that field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/lenna.shtml |title=The Rest of the Lenna Story |publisher=2.cs.cmu.edu |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, ''Playboy'' became the first gentleman's magazine to be printed in [[braille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/29/us/blind-win-ruling-on-braille-playboy.html|title=BLIND WIN RULING ON BRAILLE PLAYBOY|work=The New York Times|date=August 29, 1986|accessdate=October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the few magazines whose [[microfilm]] format was in color, not black and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/archives-archivists/msg12465.html |title=Re: Nicholson Baker and NEH |website=Ibiblio.org |date=April 16, 2001 |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features and format==

===Rabbit logo===
[[File:Playboy lighter.jpg|thumb|upright|A Playboy cigarette lighter with the distinctive rabbit [[logo]] ]]

Playboy's iconic and enduring mascot, a stylized [[silhouette]] of a [[rabbit]] wearing a [[Black tie|tuxedo bow tie]], was created by ''Playboy'' [[art director]] [[Art Paul]] for the second issue as an [[Note (typography)|endnote]], but was adopted as the official [[logo]] and has appeared ever since.&lt;ref name = Faye&gt;{{cite web|last=Faye |first=Marcia |url=http://www.iit.edu/magazine/spring_2009/article_2.shtml |title=Art Paul: The art of designing Playboy |publisher= '&amp;#39;iitmagazine'&amp;#39; |date= Spring 2009|accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Heller&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h9PZI10IuIoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=Art+Paul |title=Heller, Steven and Vienne, Véronique, '&amp;#39;The Education of an Art Director'&amp;#39; Allworth Communications, Inc., (2005)ISBN 1581154356, ISBN 978-1-58115-435-1 pp. 174–180 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=December 7, 2011|isbn=9781581154351 |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A running joke in the magazine involves hiding the logo somewhere in the cover art or photograph. Hefner said he chose the rabbit for its "humorous [[Human sexual behavior|sexual]] connotation", and because the image was "frisky and playful".
[[File:VX-4 Evaluators (insignia).jpg|thumb|upright|[[VX-4]] [[Military aircraft insignia|insignia]] ]]

In an interview Hefner explained his choice of a rabbit as ''Playboy's'' logo to the Italian journalist [[Oriana Fallaci]]:

{{quote| The rabbit, the bunny, in America has a sexual meaning; and I chose it because it's a fresh animal, shy, vivacious, jumping - sexy. First it smells you then it escapes, then it comes back, and you feel like caressing it, playing with it. A girl resembles a bunny. Joyful, joking. Consider the girl we made popular: the [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate of the Month.]] She is never sophisticated, a girl you cannot really have. She is a young, healthy, simple girl - the girl next door . . . we are not interested in the mysterious, difficult woman, the [[femme fatale]], who wears elegant underwear, with lace, and she is sad, and somehow mentally filthy. The ''Playboy'' girl has no lace, no underwear, she is naked, well washed with soap and water, and she is happy.|''"Hugh Hefner: 'I am in the center of the world,'"'' by Oriana Fallaci, ''LOOK Magazine'', January 10, 1967}}

The jaunty rabbit was quickly a popular symbol of extroverted male culture, becoming a [[Playboy Enterprises, Inc.#Playboy Licensing|lucrative source]] of [[Merchandizing#Licensing|merchandizing]] revenue for Playboy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.wired.com/2015/10/playboys-logo-is-what-mattersit-earns-more-than-nudes-do/|title = Playboy's Logo is What Matters &amp;mdash; It Earns More Than Nudes Do|last = Rhodes|first = Margaret|date = October 13, 2015|work = WIRED|access-date = October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, it was adopted as [[military aircraft insignia]] for the [[VX-4|Navy's VX-4]] fighter-evaluation squadron.

===The ''Playboy'' Interview===
Besides its centerfold, a major part of ''Playboy'' for much of its existence has been the ''Playboy'' Interview, an extensive (usually several thousand-word) discussion between a notable individual and an interviewer (historian [[Alex Haley]], for example, served as a ''Playboy'' interviewer on a few occasions; one of his interviews was with [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]; he also interviewed [[Malcolm X]] and American Nazi Party founder [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] in the April 1966 issue,&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; then coauthored Malcolm X's autobiography). One of the magazine's most notable interviews was a discussion with then-presidential candidate [[Jimmy Carter]] in the November 1976 issue, in which he stated "I've committed [[adultery]] in my heart many times."&lt;ref&gt;Playboy Interview with Jimmy Carter, ''Playboy'', November 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.mcgill.ca/history/faculty/TROYWEB/Courseweb/JimmyCarterThePlayboyInterview.htm|title=McGill University website excerpt}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Sheff]]'s interview with [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] appeared in the January 1981 issue, which was on newsstands at the time of Lennon's murder; the interview was later published in book format.

Another interview type section, entitled "20Q" (a play on the game of [[Twenty Questions]]), was added in October 1978. [[Cheryl Tiegs]] was the first interviewee for the section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/worldofplayboy/faq/trivia.html#5|title=playboy.com / world of playboy / events|accessdate=December 16, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607094500/http://www.playboy.com/worldofplayboy/faq/trivia.html#5|archivedate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rock the Rabbit===
"Rock the Rabbit" was an annual music news and pictorial feature published in the March edition.&lt;ref name="stolz"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stolz|first1=Kim|title=Duran Duran And Playboy Team Up To 'Rock The Rabbit,' Celebrate Band's 13th LP|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1574295/duran-duran-and-playboy-team-up-to-rock-the-rabbit-celebrate-bands-13th-lp/|website=mtv.com|publisher=MTV|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pictorial featured images of [[rock bands]] photographed by music photographer [[Mick Rock]]. Fashion designers participated in the Rock the Rabbit event by designing T-shirts inspired by Playboy's rabbit head logo for each band. The shirts were sold at Playboy's retailers and auctioned off to raise money for AIDS at LIFEbeat: The Music Industry Fights AIDS.&lt;ref name="stolz"/&gt; Notable bands who were featured include: [[MGMT]], [[Daft Punk]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Flaming Lips]], [[Snow Patrol]], and [[The Killers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cawein|first1=Elizabeth|title=MGMT Poses For Playboy In Rock The Rabbit Campaign|url=http://www.thefader.com/2009/02/11/mgmt-poses-for-playboy-in-rock-the-rabbit-campaign|website=thefader.com|publisher=The Fader, Inc.|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Playboy Special Editions''===
{{Main|Playboy Special Edition}}

The success of ''Playboy'' magazine has led PEI to market other versions of the magazine, the [[Playboy Special Edition|Special Editions]] (formerly called ''Newsstand Specials''), such as ''[[Playboy's College Girls]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where the Babes are |url=http://www.playboy.com/on-campus/features/topten/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507174950/http://www.playboy.com/on-campus/features/topten/index.html |archivedate=May 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Playboy's Book of Lingerie]]'', as well as the [[List of Playboy videos|''Playboy'' video]] collection.

===Braille===
The [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]] (NLS) has published a [[Braille]] edition of ''Playboy'' since 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/nls/reference/circulars/magazines.html |title=NLS Reference Circular: Magazine Program (2007) |publisher=Loc.gov |date=August 25, 2010 |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Braille version includes all the written words in the non-Braille magazine, but no pictorial representations. Congress cut off funding for the Braille magazine translation in 1985, but U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan reversed the decision on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acb.org/magazine/2000/bf062000.html#bf16 |title=The Braille Forum, June 2000 |archivedate=May 10, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510080522/http://www.acb.org/magazine/2000/bf062000.html#bf16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online===
The growth of the Internet prompted the magazine to develop an official web presence called ''Playboy'' Online or Playboy.com, which is the official website for [[Playboy Enterprises]], and an online companion to ''Playboy'' magazine. The site has been available online since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.playboy.com/ |title=Playboy Web Space&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19961220001705/http://www1.playboy.com/ |archivedate = December 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the online presence, Playboy developed a pay web site called the ''Playboy Cyber Club'' in 1995 which features online chats, additional pictorials, videos of [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]]s and Playboy Cyber Girls that are not featured in the magazine. Archives of past ''Playboy'' articles and interviews are also included. In September 2005, Playboy launched the online edition of the magazine ''Playboy Digital''.

In 2010, Playboy introduced "The Smoking Jacket", a [[safe for work|safe-for-work]] website designed to appeal to young men, while avoiding nude images or key words that would cause the site to be filtered or otherwise prohibited in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/07/21/DDR21EH4ED.DTL |title=Playboy busts out of mold on the Smoking Jacket |author=Don Babwin |date=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Playboy introduced i.playboy.com, a complete, uncensored version of its near 700 issue archive, targeting the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPad]].  By launching the archive as a [[web app]], Playboy was able to circumvent both Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] content restrictions and their 30% subscription fee.

==Litigation and legal issues==
{{Further|Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp.}}

On January 14, 2004, the [[Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals]] ruled that Playboy Enterprises Inc.'s trademark terms "Playboy" and "Playmate" should be protected in the situation where a user typing "Playboy" or "Playmate" in a [[Web browser|browser]] search was instead shown advertisements of companies that competed with PEI. This decision reversed an earlier district court ruling. The suit started on April 15, 1999, when Playboy sued [[Excite|Excite Inc.]] and [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] for trademark infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1024-5146502.html |title=Netscape, Playboy settle search trademark case - CNET News.com |publisher=News.cnet.com |accessdate=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Bans on the sale of ''Playboy''}}Censorship===
Many in the American religious community opposed the publication of ''Playboy''. The [[Louisiana]] pastor and author L. L. Clover wrote in his 1974 treatise ''Evil Spirits Intellectualism and Logic'' that ''Playboy'' encouraged young men to view themselves as "pleasure-seeking individuals for whom sex is fun and women are play things."&lt;ref&gt;L. L. Clover, ''Evil Spirits, Intellectualism and Logic'' ([[Minden, Louisiana]]: Louisiana Missionary Baptist Institute and Seminary, 1974), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many parts of Asia, including India, [[mainland China]], [[Myanmar]], Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Brunei, sale and distribution of ''Playboy'' is banned. In addition, sale and distribution is banned in most Muslim countries (except Lebanon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2003-03-30/entertainment/18232125_1_arabic-version-arab-world-al-jazeera-satellite-channel | location=New York | work=Daily News | title= Foreign Web sites offer alternate perspectives on the conflict in Iraq| first=Michelle | last=Megna | date=March 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albawaba.com/news/index.php3?sid=244050&amp;lang=e&amp;dir=news |title=Middle East and Arab World Headline News |publisher=Al Bawaba |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=December 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618163752/http://www.albawaba.com/news/index.php3?sid=244050&amp;lang=e&amp;dir=news |archivedate=June 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Turkey) in Asia and Africa, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. Despite the ban on the magazine in these countries, the official ''Playboy'' brand itself can still appear on various merchandise such as perfume and deodorants.

While banned in mainland China, the magazine is sold in Hong Kong. In Japan, where [[Censorship of pornography in Japan|genitals of models cannot be shown]], a separate edition was published under license by [[Shueisha]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} An Indonesian edition was launched in April 2006, but controversy started before the first issue hit the stands. Though the publisher said the content of the Indonesian edition will be different from the original edition, the government tried to ban it by using anti-pornography rules.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} A Muslim organization, the [[Islamic Defenders Front]] (IDF), opposed ''Playboy'' on the grounds of pornography. On April 12, about 150 IDF members clashed with police and stoned the editorial offices. Despite this, the edition quickly sold out. On April 6, 2007, the chief judge of the case dismissed the charges because they had been incorrectly filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Playboy' charges thrown out of court|author=Thompson, G.|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-04-05/playboy-charges-thrown-out-of-court/2235604|newspaper=ABC News|date=April 5, 2007|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the American convenience store chain [[7-Eleven]] removed the magazine. The store returned ''Playboy'' to its shelves in late 2003. 7-Eleven had also been selling ''Penthouse'' and other similar magazines before the ban.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 1995, ''Playboy'' was returned to shelves in the Republic of Ireland after a 36-year ban, despite staunch opposition from many women's groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JN0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B2sFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=playboy%20ireland&amp;pg=2550%2C4757731] {{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Playboy'' was not sold in the state of [[Queensland, Australia]] during 2004 and 2005 but returned as of 2006. Due to declining sales, the last Australia-wide edition of ''Playboy'' was the January 2000 issue.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 2013, ''Playboy'' was cleared by the [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]] of violating its rule against selling sexually explicit material on military property, but the base exchanges stopped selling it anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/military-green-lights-playboy-and-penthouse-before-banning-them/ |title=Military Green Lights Playboy and Penthouse Before Banning Them |website=Outsidethebeltway.com |date=August 1, 2013 |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Playboy announced they would be deactivating their [[Facebook]] accounts due to the "sexually repressive" nature of the social media platform and their [[Criticism of Facebook#Application privacy breach|mismanagement of user data]] resulting from the [[Cambridge Analytica]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |first=Writer |url=http://adage.com/article/digital/playboy-deletes-facebook-account-citing-values/312901/ |title=Now Playboy Deletes Its Facebook Account, Citing Values |work=[[Advertising Age]] |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=March 28, 2018 |accessdate=March 29, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Population Control: Real Costs, Illusory Benefits'''''  is a nonfiction book by [[Steven W. Mosher]], first published in 2008.
''Population Control'' is a detailed exposition on the global effort to combat [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], arguing that not only population control is immoral in many cases, but that overpopulation is a myth.&lt;ref name="washingtontimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=D´Agostino |first=Joseph A. |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jul/27/taking-on-the-overpopulation-myth/?page=all |title=Taking on the overpopulation myth |publisher=[[Washington Times]] |date=2008-07-27 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosher was first exposed to population control policies when he visited China as an undergraduate sociologist in 1979 to conduct anthropological research. While there, he documented the implementation of China’s [[one child policy]] with [[forced abortion]]s firsthand.&lt;ref name="washingtontimes" /&gt;

The author who leads the [[Population Research Institute]] opposes the standard [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]]ian idea that overpopulation is a threat to human prosperity and future.&lt;ref name="FoFF"&gt;{{cite web|last=[[George Leef|Leef, George]] |first= |url=https://www.fff.org/explore-freedom/article/crusade-population/?page=all |title=The Crusade Against Population |publisher=The Future of Freedom Foundation |date=2008-12-01 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bangladesh]], it is against the law to watch, produce,  distribute, or possess [[pornography]], since the Pornography Control Act has been passed since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-porn law has 7 years in jail|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2012/01/29/anti-porn-law-has-7-years-in-jail|website=bdnews24.com|accessdate=15 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220130356/http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2012/01/29/anti-porn-law-has-7-years-in-jail|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 a report found increase in production of child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Studies show rise in child pornography|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-102309|website=thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=15 December 2016|date=20 August 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220125601/http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-102309|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 a study found that over 30 million Taka worth of pornography is downloaded per month in Cyber Cafes in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The report also found 77 percent of pornography viewers were underage.&lt;ref name="wxv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Let’s talk about porn|url=http://archive.dhakatribune.com/long-form/2013/oct/28/let%E2%80%99s-talk-about-porn|website=archive.dhakatribune.com|publisher=Dhaka Tribune|accessdate=15 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220154255/http://archive.dhakatribune.com/long-form/2013/oct/28/let%E2%80%99s-talk-about-porn|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the High Court of Bangladesh asked the government to stop pornographic material in social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop pornography in social media: HC|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/stop-pornography-social-media-hc-81524|website=thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=15 December 2016|date=10 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220130358/http://www.thedailystar.net/country/stop-pornography-social-media-hc-81524|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Bangladesh Government Minister, [[Tarana Halim]], has announced plans to block internet porn sites in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tarana vows to block porn sites|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/132519/Tarana-vows-to-block-porn-sites|website=en.prothom-alo.com|publisher=Prothom Alo|accessdate=15 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161214233515/http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/132519/Tarana-vows-to-block-porn-sites|archivedate=14 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
The [[Pornography Control act of 2012]] criminalized pornography. The possession, distribution, production, and using of pornographic material was made illegal.

==Socio-cultural attitudes==
The criminalization of pornography has raised questions of freedom of speech and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh Pornography Ban Raises Issue of Online Privacy|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/bangladesh-pornography-ban-raises-issue-of-online-privacy-66249/|website=christianpost.com|accessdate=15 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20161212132418/http://www.christianpost.com/news/bangladesh-pornography-ban-raises-issue-of-online-privacy-66249/|archivedate=12 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Press Secretary to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Abul Kalam Azad, said "pornography has spread like a disease in Bangladesh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh Seeks Law to Criminalize Pornography|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/bangladesh-seeks-law-criminalize-pornography-389844|website=ibtimes.com|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=15 December 2016|date=2 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220172143/http://www.ibtimes.com/bangladesh-seeks-law-criminalize-pornography-389844|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pornography is viewed negatively and is blamed for making children "perverts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=77pc schoolchildren watch pornography|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/123431/77pc-schoolchildren-watch-pornography|website=en.prothom-alo.com|publisher=Prothom Alo|accessdate=15 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218001920/http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/123431/77pc-schoolchildren-watch-pornography|archivedate=18 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tradition==
Swami Prakashanand Saraswati was of the lineage of the great Vashnavite sage of West Bengal [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (1486–1534).&lt;ref name="encylopedia-of-american-religions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hindu_encyclopedia" /&gt; Followers of [[Vaishnavism]], as well as other schools of [[Hinduism]], believe that a great [[Guru]] can teach disciples even after the guru is no longer in a physical body.&lt;ref name="hindu_encyclopedia" /&gt; Communication between the visible and invisible is taken for granted and is an essential factor in many types of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="hindu_encyclopedia" /&gt; Chaitanya is assumed to be in charge of his lineage even today.&lt;ref name="hindu_encyclopedia" /&gt; Swami Prakashanand Saraswati described:&lt;ref name="Palaniswami" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our tradition of ''raganuga bhakti'' is eternal. It comes from the Vedas. Around 3,102 BC Krishna Himself descended on the earth planet in His Divine form and Ved Vyas re-established the same knowledge through the Bhagwatam which continues until today. Five hundred years ago, the descension of Radha in the form of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu further revealed, rejuvenated and established this form of devotion which became the guideline for the devotees of today. This tradition is called ''achintya bhedabhed vad''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Apart from a life oriented on either sense gratification or the practice of ''yogic'' and psychic disciplines (considered to be merely the exploration of the inner world of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''), Swami Prakashanand Saraswati taught the path of God's love and the development of an affinity toward, and personal feeling of love for Godhead Personality.&lt;ref name="encylopedia-of-american-religions" /&gt; This devotional approach is explained in the [[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]], [[Bhagavad Gita]], and the [[Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref name="encylopedia-of-american-religions" /&gt; It is centred upon the remembrance of Krishna and chanting his name while devotionally offering one's emotional feeling to Him.&lt;ref name="encylopedia-of-american-religions" /&gt;

==History==
Swami Prakashanand Saraswati was born in a respectable ''[[brahmin]]'' family in 1929&lt;ref name="Palaniswami" /&gt; in [[Ayodhya]],&lt;ref name="encylopedia-of-american-religions"&gt;Melton, J.G. 1993. ''[[Encyclopedia of American Religions]]''. [[Gale Research]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palaniswami" /&gt; India. His early life was fraught with intense religious feelings, and as a youth he became a reclusive mystic so that he might find God.&lt;ref name="hindu_encyclopedia" /&gt; He completed his studies and at age of 21, renounced the world and took the order of ''[[sanya]]s''.&lt;ref name="hindu_encyclopedia"&gt;Jones, C.A. &amp; James, J.D. 2007. ''Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', pg. 200–201. [[Infobase Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palaniswami"&gt;Palaniswami, P. (3 September 1995). ''a Dham Blooms in Texas''. ''[[Hinduism Today]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, he was offered to become the [[Shankaracharya|Jagadguru Shankaracharya]] of Jyotirmath but he declined,&lt;ref name="Srinivasan"&gt;Srinivasan, T.M. 2000. ''The True History and the Religion of India: A Concise Encyclopedia of Authentic Hinduism. (A Review)''. ''International Journal of Humanities and Peace'', 16(1): 105.

He spent the next 20 years&lt;ref name="encylopedia-of-american-religions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hindu_encyclopedia" /&gt; as a wandering ascetic in the Himalayas and in the forests of central India, ending in [[Braj]].&lt;ref name="hindu_encyclopedia" /&gt; Following the strict discipline of sannyas, he first lived in the Himalayas (Joshimath, Badrinath, Rishikesh, Haridwar, etc.), forests of Amarkantak, near the Narbada River, Allahabad and Kashi for about four years. Later, he went to Vrindaban and then to Barsana where he spent over 18 years in the deep woodlands of Braj.&lt;ref name="Palaniswami" /&gt; In 1975, he emerged from his solitary life he began his mission of teaching the path of ''raganuga bhakti''.&lt;ref name="Ludwig"&gt;Ludwig, M. 9 March 2002. ''Houses of worship''. ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' (Texas)&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the International Society of Divine Love in India in 1975. The society was established in New Zealand in 1978. Later on he travelled to America and founded an ashram for his devotees and disciples. By 1981 Swami Prakashanand Saraswati, who had begun to be thought of as a distinguished sage and a saint,&lt;ref name="hindu_encyclopedia" /&gt; conceived of creating a global mission,&lt;ref name="hindu_encyclopedia" /&gt; establishing religious centres in India, England, Ireland, Singapore, New Zealand, and Australia.&lt;ref name="hindu_encyclopedia" /&gt;

==Writings and awards==
Swami Prakashanand Saraswati has written over nine books on various aspects of Hindu ethics, scriptures and practices.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan" /&gt; He has represented the Hindu religion at the Millennium World Peace Summit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.millenniumpeacesummit.org/news000905.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 he wrote ''The True History and the Religion of India: A Concise Encyclopedia of Authentic Hinduis'', a "monumental dissertation" on the history of Indian civilization and religion.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan" /&gt; The eight-hundred-page tome is entitled ''The True History and the Religion of India''.&lt;ref name="Kurien" /&gt; It is a comprehensive history of religion in Indian culture.&lt;ref name=Nithyananda /&gt; The book has received laudatory comments from prominent Hindu academics and leaders in the United States and India.&lt;ref name="Kurien" /&gt; It was released by [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|The Minister of State for Information &amp; Broadcasting]] Shri [[Ramesh Bais]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/archieve/phtgalry/pgyr2001/pg082001/pg03aug2001/030820018.html Photo archive of Press Information Bureau, Government of India].&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopaedia won an award at the World Religious Parliament in New Delhi in 1999.&lt;ref name="Kurien" /&gt; In 2001, the book was published by [[Motilal Banarsidass]]. It has subsequently been published by [[Macmillan Publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://macmillanindia.com/book-details.asp?from=gr&amp;category=General+%26+Reference&amp;bookid=3057&amp;broadid=47&amp;broadsubjectname=General MacMillan India]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplified and abridged version of the book for college students, entitled Amazing Facts about Hinduism, was released at the Global Dharma Conference in 2003.&lt;ref name="Kurien" /&gt; He was awarded the title of "Dharm Chakravarti"&lt;ref name="dharm-Chakravarti" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siṃhadeba, J.P. 2006.

==Research with Maxwell Cade==
Swami Prakashanand Saraswati's state of "conscious ecstasy", and the effects of his Divine Love Meditation, was studied by Dr. Maxwell Cade in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Palaniswami" /&gt;&lt;ref name=morris&gt;Morris, J. 2013. ''Acorns: Windows High-Tide Foghat:, Volume 1''. I Universe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peake&gt;Peake, A. 2013. ''Infinite Mindfield: A Quest to Find the Gateway to Higher Consciousness''. Mmm Baird Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Maxwell Cade, a leading physicist of London,&lt;ref name="Palaniswami" /&gt; and [[Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;Coxhead, N. 1976. ''Mindpower: the emerging pattern of current research''. [[St. Martin's Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; had been doing psycho-biological research during the 1970s on meditation and the altered states of the consciousness of the mind.&lt;ref name="hill"&gt;Hill, A. 1979. ''A Visual encyclopedia of unconventional medicine''. [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Publishers]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1421560/Geoffrey-Blundell.html ''Geoffrey Blundell'']. 10 February 2003. [[The Daily Telegraph]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inglis"&gt;Inglis, B. &amp; West, R. 1983. ''The alternative health guide''. Knopf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cade-1989"&gt;Cade, C. M. &amp; Coxhead, N. 1989. ''The awakened mind: biofeedback and the development of higher states of awareness''. Element Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell Cade co-developed the "Mind Mirror", a portable [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] machine that could monitor the [[Alpha wave|alpha]], [[Beta wave|beta]], [[Delta wave|delta]] and [[Theta rhythm|theta]] rhythms from each brain hemisphere simultaneously.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; In the 1970s, a number of eastern religious teachers expressed an interest in participating in Maxwell Cade's research, and agreed to have their brain rhythms measured.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; In 1976 when he was touring England, Swami Prakashanand Saraswati requested to participate in Dr. Maxwell Cade's research.&lt;ref name="Palaniswami" /&gt; Dr. Maxwell Cade and his team found patterns they had not seen before.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; Maxwell Cade concluded that the Swamis' spiritual training conferred unusual powers of healing and perception.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

Dr. Cade spent two weeks with Prakashanand Saraswati to measure his brainwaves, and he always seemed to be in this "Awakened Mind" pattern.&lt;ref name="awakened_mind_1979"&gt;Cade, M. 1977. ''The Awakened Mind, Biofeedback and the Development of Higher States of Awareness''. [[Dell Publishing|Delacorte Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he measured brainwave patterns, only previously measured in a few rare individuals, that Maxwell Cade characterizes as the "State beyond the Awakened Mind".&lt;ref name="cade-1989" /&gt; Cade commented: ". . . he has attained to that level of consciousness at which he is in the higher reaches of meditation and in everyday waking consciousness at the same time".&lt;ref name="EEG"&gt;[http://www.mindmirroreeg.com/w/maxCade/McHealing.htm "Chapter 7: The healing response – a new direction"] Retrieved 8 Nov&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, Maxwell Cade says that Saraswati "produced the most beautiful fifth-state pattern on the Mind Mirror for more than an hour while engaging in an intense debate with Professor [[John Hasted]], a noted physicist".&lt;ref name="cade-1989" /&gt; Saraswati wanted to test out the effects of his new form of meditation called the "Divine Love Meditation." He had Maxwell Cade test subjects while listening to a tape consisting of chanting and they measured the effects. According to Cade, both experienced and non-meditators were able to produce a form of "Awakened Mind" pattern while listening to these tapes.&lt;ref name="awakened_mind_1979" /&gt;

He writes, "Those who have close contact with His Divinity know that he remains continually in his Divine-Love transcendence. This corresponds to what [[Carl Jung]] termed 'the Transcendent Function.'" Further, Cade writes that he "had not seen anyone who could equal Swamiji's feat of touching a number of subjects on the head and immediately raising their pattern of consciousness by two levels, from the ordinary waking state into the advanced fifth state. In at least one of these subjects, the higher state persisted for three days and was an unforgettable experience."&lt;ref name="Palaniswami" /&gt; Cade's wife reportedly had an "unforgettable experience" from meeting Swami Prakashanand Saraswati and participating in the study.&lt;ref name="sanctified-body" /&gt; Maxwell Cade characterised it as "an experience of great impact".&lt;ref name="EEG" /&gt; It was, he wrote later:  ". . . a perfect opportunity to study his remarkable EEG patterns under varying circumstances, to discuss the application of scientific methods to the study of meditation, and to learn about Divine Love Meditation at the feet of this great Master".&lt;ref name="EEG" /&gt; 
 
Cade published his research in his "landmark book",&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. 2008. ''Measuring the Immeasurable: The Scientific Case for Spirituality''. ''[[Sounds True]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Awakened Mind''.&lt;ref name="awakened_mind_1979" /&gt; Cade's research with Swami Prakashanand Saraswati has also been discussed in several other publications including by Hill (1979),&lt;ref name="hill" /&gt; Inglis &amp; West (1983),&lt;ref name="inglis" /&gt; Treece (1989)&lt;ref name="sanctified-body"&gt;Treece, P. 1979. ''The sanctified body''. [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Peake (2013).&lt;ref name=peake /&gt;

Cade showed evidence for temporary and in some cases long-term elevation of state even after twenty minutes of Divine Love Meditation.&lt;ref name=morris /&gt;&lt;ref name=peake /&gt;

==Trial, conviction and disappearance==
In 2007, three former residents of Barsana Dham (Radha Madhav Dham), aged between 27 and 30 years old,&lt;ref&gt;Swamy convicted of molestation in
US. Rediff News&lt;/ref&gt; told [[Hays County, Texas]] police that they had been abused at the ashram by Saraswati, who was then arrested on 25 April 2008.

A 12-person jury declared Saraswati guilty of 20 counts of child molestation, after 50 minutes deliberation, on Friday 4 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/indians-abroad/Hindu-guru-convicted-of-molesting-girls-in-US/articleshow/7644917.cms Hindu guru convicted of molesting girls in US – The Times of India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After being convicted, he was released on a $10 million bond provided by TV infomercial entrepreneur Peter Spiegel.&lt;ref name=watchdog /&gt;&lt;ref name=kxan /&gt; As part of the bond condition, Saraswati was barred from entering the Barsana Dham.

In April, following the disappearance of its founder the ashram changed its name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smmercury.com/19233/with-guru-on-the-lam-ashram-changes-name/ "With guru on the lam, ashram changes name"], by Sean Kimmons, ''San Marcos Mercury'', 22 April 2011, accessed 16 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Programa Nacional de Población''''' was a program conducted in Peru in the early 1990s to reduce population growth as a way of meeting international demographic standards. [[Compulsory sterilization]], which is a method that forces individuals to partake in sterilization operations, was the main method employed by the Peruvian government to decrease population.  While the motives and practices for such sterilizations vary, Compulsory Sterilization in the case of Peru under President [[Alberto Fujimori]] was a program strictly intended to lower national population growth by decreasing the fertility rate among women.&lt;ref name="Boesten"&gt;Boesten, Jelke. "Free Choice or Poverty Alleviation? Population Politics in Peru under Alberto Fujimori." ''European Review of Latin American and Caribbean Studies / Revista Europea de Estudios Latinoamericanos y del Caribe'', No. 82 (April 2007), pp. 3-20&lt;/ref&gt; The program, titled ''Programa Nacional de Población'' (National Population Program), was directed at Peru's impoverished, indigenous, and marginalized communities and therefore implied the government's intention to diminish the rural population in order to enhance future economic growth.&lt;ref name="Boesten"/&gt;

==Political and Economic Background==
The social and political climate of Peru in the 1990s at the time of the aforementioned sterilization program was the result of decades of class struggle and institutionalized inequality.  Peru is a country that has long been subordinate to [[oligarchy]] in its society and as a result the class divide between a handful of "powerful individuals" and the remaining "poor and impotent majority" is significant.&lt;ref name="Gorman"&gt;Gorman, Stephen M. "The Economic and Social Foundations of Elite Power in Peru: A Review of the Literature." Social and Economic Studies , Vol. 29, No. 2/3 (June/September 1980), pp. 292-319&lt;/ref&gt;

This issue of class - in addition to Peru's political instability and dependency on capitalist order from international governments - left the country in a vulnerable political, social, and economic position.  In positions such as these, the poor are left inevitably to suffer from the failed policies of the upper class. This vulnerable state proved to be detrimental to Peru's constitutional government and civil society when the military overthrew President [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] in 1968 and remained in occupation of the government for an entire decade. Within this decade-long military regime under appointed President [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], Peruvian government made significant leftist reforms and intended to give justice to the poor.  However, these reforms were unsuccessful and the poor and indigenous suffered as the country plummeted further into debt. It was not until 1979, under General [[Francisco Morales Bermúdez]] that Peru adopted a new national constitution and focused on regaining economic strength within the country.&lt;ref name="Coe"&gt;Coe, Anna-Britt. "From Anti-Natalist to Ultra-Conservative: Restricting Reproductive Choice in Peru" Reproductive Health Matters , Vol. 12, No. 24, Power, Money and Autonomy in National Policies and Programmes (Nov., 2004), pp. 56-69&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this new constitution, population growth and families' rights to fertility were topics of political concern.&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;  As a result of this new focus, the Ministry of Health began to offer public services towards family planning in 1983.&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt; In 1985, the National Population Policy Law was passed and shortly thereafter the National Population Program was established.&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;

The population policy law, which continues to be in effect, intends to promote "a balanced relationship between population size, structure and distribution, and socio-economic development." &lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt; The law also specifically catered to the enhancement and protection of the human rights of Peruvian citizens with its promise to ensure voluntary and informed consent in issues regarding contraception and health services.  However, Peru's government was still in the midst of internal conflict. Due to a lack of political support, there was not enough funding for the programs needed to carry out the National Population Policy Law.  As a result, implementation of the law remained stagnant until the presidency of Alberto Fujimori in 1990.  In 1991, a new National Population Program was developed, known as ''Programa Nacional de Población''.&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;  Although Fujimori was an avid public supporter of family planning, the new National Population Program and its specific goals and strategies seemingly counteracted the law's initial purpose of preserving individual human rights.

==Demographics==
As of 1992, Peru was ranked as having the fifth highest population in the Latin American region with an estimated number of 22,767,543 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Congress"&gt;United States Library of Congress. ''Peru: Environment and Population''. Washington: US Library of Congress, 1992. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The country is generally split into three geographic regions: the coastal region, the highlands, and the selva (Amazon region).  As of 1990, the demographics for these areas were as follows: 53% of the nation's population in the coastal region, 36% percent in the highlands, and 11% in the selva.&lt;ref name="Congress"/&gt;  The National Population Program under Fujimori focused heavily on highland population, as it was the region inhabited by the largest amount of the country's indigenous peoples.

The chart below portrays the demographic evolution of Peru since the year 1520.  The green colored points on the chart mark the population at the time of the Inca Empire prior to Spanish conquest.  The yellow marks the population during Spanish colonization.  The red signifies population during the independent republic of what Peru is today, and the blue is the projected population by the National Institute of Statistics and Information Technology (''Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática'') up until the year 2050.

==Population Issues==
The issue of population growth in Peru is directly connected with the social, political and economic inequality within the country.  The average number of childbirths for Peruvian women is higher than that of Latin America's general average and also higher than the average of women in the United States.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;Schmidt, Bria. "Forced Sterilization in Peru." Political Environments #6, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; As for the comparison of birth rates within the country, 1.7 is the average number of children per woman with a university or college education while the average is 6.2 children per woman for those who have little or no education.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; Women living in rural areas, mostly of indigenous descent, have the highest average birth rate at 7.1 children per woman.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

In the Andean countryside, the maternal mortality ratio is "very high for the region" at 185 deaths per 100,000 live births.&lt;ref name="Boesten"/&gt;  In addition, there are 66 abortions for every 100 live births, even though abortion is illegal in Peru and therefore is most likely conducted with high risk.&lt;ref name="Boesten"/&gt;

The issues that arise from this discrepancy in birth rates are troubling.  When looking solely at statistics, it can be said that the high birth rate among the lower classes of society continues the [[cycle of poverty]]. However, it must also be noted that the reason for such high birth rates is linked to factors such as the lack of access to education and income disparity.

==The National Population Program (1991-Present Day)==

===Goals===

With the newly drafted version of the National Population Program (''Programa Nacional de Población'') under Fujimori, goals were specified in the context of demographics. The Peruvian Ministry of Health's program manager stated that impoverished indigenous women are "poor and producing more poor people.  The President is aware that the government cannot fight poverty without reducing the poor people's fertility.  Thus, demographic goals are a combination of the population's right to access family planning and the government's anti-poverty strategy."&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;  The program was targeted towards poor women who had "little or no formal education".&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt; Thus, the program intended to:

*reduce population growth rate from 2.1% to 2%
*reduce the total fertility rate from 3.5% to 3.3%
*reduce maternal and child mortality rates
*foster "equitable socio-economic opportunities" between men and women&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;

===Strategies===

The National Population program called on both public and private sectors to assist in its strategic implementation.  Furthermore, seven strategies were laid out as guidelines to reach the intended demographic goals:

*reproductive health and family planning
*communication and information dissemination
*decentralization of population policy
*education
*production of research and statistics
*advancement of women and youth
*environmental protection&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;

===Setbacks===

Because these strategies required the cooperation of various institutions, the program failed to be carried out with ease yet again due to the lack of coherence within the involved political sectors and agencies.  Many agencies "lacked sufficient power to carry out [its] functions" and others were either "not interested" or opposed to working in agreement "due to inter-institutional rivalries".&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;  Peru's internal conflict from decades past continued to work against the overall productivity of the institution and its ability to sufficiently serve constituents.

Funding was also a crucial issue that proved to be an additional setback to the National Population Program.  In Peruvian government, as with many Latin American countries, the Catholic Church held significant power over issues both public and private.  Essentially, the moral support of the distinguished members of the Church would result in financial support. However the Catholic community looked down upon the National Population Program due to its promise to provide modern contraceptives.&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;  Knowing fully well that his program would not be a success without the Catholic Church's approval, President Fujimori "toned down" the program's focus on contraception.&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;

===Foreign Donors===

Without full support from the Catholic Church, outside funding was required for the program's success.  International pressure to meet population standards became evident when the [[International Monetary Fund]] suggested that the Peruvian government cut funding for social services to allow for more spending in areas called for by the program.&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;  In addition, [[USAID]] (United States Agency for International Development) contributed US$85 million between 1994 and 1998. Because the financial support from foreign donors brought economic and political pressure upon Fujimori to meet international standards, the plan to decrease population growth consequently became more focused on quotas than individual rights and health issues.

===Implementation===

After the goals were defined and the funding for the National Population Program was in place, the number of annual sterilizations in Peru rose drastically.  Prior to the program, there were less than 15,000 sterilizations performed per year and women could only have the operation performed "if they had a health risk, four or more children, or were above a certain age".&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt; However, after 1995 when sterilizations began to be performed, there were no pre-existing conditions necessary for sterilizations other than that women had to be considered part of Peru's poor and disenfranchised community. In addition, the number of annual sterilization procedures rose after the program's implementation from 15,000 to 67,000 in 1996 and 115,000 in 1997.&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;

The program's implementation also brought up several issues in terms of the quality and care of the procedures.  Most of the personnel hired to perform sterilizations were not properly trained and much of the equipment used was outdated and lacking in quality. The counseling services provided to patients were also backed by poorly trained staff and many women were not given "quality information prior to procedures".&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt; When sterilizations were given, they were done so in a hurriedly manner.  "Teams were dispatchd one day at a time to perform procedures" and therefore attempted to cover large masses of women in rural areas in very minimal amounts of time.&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;  As a result, patients were denied sufficient and proper treatment and rarely received follow-up care.

Bribery, threats, and deception were methods used in the implementation of such procedures by medical personnel.  A large number of the indigenous Peruvian population speaks [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and are unable to read, write, and sometimes even communicate in Spanish.  Many women were deceived by personnel and told that the procedures were operations other than sterilization.  There were also instances of men being told they would be fined or jailed if they did not order their wives to have the operation. A former physician for the Ministry of Health confirms these practices:

''"We were required to perform a certain number of sterilizations each month.  This was obligatory and if we did not comply, we were fired.  Many providers did not inform women that they were going to be sterilized - they told them that the procedure was something else.  But I felt this was wrong.  I preferred to offer women a bag of rice to convince them to accept the procedure and explained to them beforehand what was going to happen."''&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;

==Public reaction==
Because the procedures of the National Population Program went against Peru's constitutional law and violated human rights law, foreign donors threatened to suspend support for any aspects of the program that were sterilization related.  Many public organizations, such as ''Centro de la Mujer Peruana Flora Tristán'' and the ''Comité de América Latina y el Caribe para la Defensa de los Derechos de la Mujer'' ([[CLADEM]]), began to voice their concerns for the program and attempt to obtain evidence against the Ministry of Health and the Peruvian government for their covert actions.&lt;ref name= "Coe"/&gt;  In 1997, the newspaper ''La República'' reported on the human rights violations of the National Population Program and sparked a nationwide debate that brought the government's actions to the forefront of Peruvian media.&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;

==Program Reform==
In 1998, the Peruvian government and the Ministry of Health agreed to reform the controversial aspects of the National Population Program.&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt; The elimination of numeric goals was arguably the most important change to the program as demographic goals and quotas were no longer needed.  While sterilization was not eliminated entirely, the reforms for the implementation of the procedure included:
*new counseling guidelines
*new consent forms
*two counseling sessions for patients
*72-hour waiting period between second counseling session and sterilization
*24-hour hospitalization after the procedure
*certifications for health facilities and physicians&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;

Finally, the language of the National Population Program was also changed.  Rather than a target of 2.5 births per woman as it was written in the original law in 1991, the reformed program intended to "reach a total fertility rate compatible with the individual reproductive intentions".&lt;ref name="Coe"/&gt;

'''Rational emotive behavior therapy''' ('''REBT'''), previously called '''rational therapy''' and '''rational emotive therapy''', is an active-directive, [[philosophy|philosophically]] and [[empirical]]ly based [[psychotherapy]], the aim of which is to resolve [[emotion]]al and [[behavior]]al problems and disturbances and to help people to lead happier and more fulfilling lives.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A.

New York, NY: Citadel Press&lt;/ref&gt; REBT was created and developed by the [[United States|American]] [[psychotherapist]] and [[psychologist]] [[Albert Ellis]], who was inspired by many of the teachings of [[Asia]]n, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and modern philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A.

Sarasota, FL: Professional Resource Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis became synonymous with the highly influential therapy. [[Psychology Today]] noted, "No individual — not even Freud himself — has had a greater impact on modern psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, R. (2001). "The Prince of Reason". Psychology Today.&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) is both a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] system of theory and practices and a school of thought established by [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]]. Ellis first presented his ideas at a conference of the American Psychological Association in 1956&lt;ref&gt;[ELLIS, A. Rational Psychotherapy. Paper read at Amer. Psychol. Ass. Chicago, August, 1956. Also J. gen. Psychol., in press]&lt;/ref&gt; then published a seminal article in 1957 entitled "Rational psychotherapy and individual psychology", in which he set the foundation for what he was calling Rational Therapy (RT) and carefully responded to questions from [[Rudolf Dreikurs]] and others about the similarities and differences with [[Alfred Adler]]'s [[Individual psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-about-psychology.com/rational-psychotherapy.html Rational Psychotherapy and Individual Psychology.] Ellis, Albert. 1957.  Journal of Individual Psychology 13: 38-44.&lt;/ref&gt; This was around a decade before psychiatrist [[Aaron Beck]] first set forth his "[[cognitive therapy]]", after Ellis had contacted him in the mid 1960s. Ellis' own approach was renamed to ''Rational Emotive Therapy'' in 1959, then to the current term in 1992.

Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy have been identified in ancient philosophical traditions, particularly [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Robertson, D | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first major book on rational therapy, Ellis wrote that the central principle of his approach, that people are rarely emotionally affected by external events but rather by their thinking about such events, "was originally discovered and stated by the ancient Stoic philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Ellis, A. | title=Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy| year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis illustrates this with a quote from the [[Enchiridion of Epictetus|''Enchiridion'']] of [[Epictetus]]: "Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them."  Ellis noted that [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] expressed a similar thought in ''[[Hamlet]]'': "There's nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert  (1962) Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis also acknowledges early 20th century therapists, particularly [[Paul Charles Dubois]], though he only read his work several years after developing his therapy.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Theoretical assumptions &lt;!--This section is linked from [[Cognitive therapy]]: do not rename without including an anchor to previous name ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt; ==
{{See also|Cognitive therapy#Cognitive model}}
A fundamental premise of REBT is humans do not get emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others.&lt;ref name="ellis1"&gt;Ellis, Albert (2001). Overcoming Destructive Beliefs, Feelings, and Behaviors: New Directions for Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. [[Prometheus Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been attributed as far back as the Roman philosopher [[Epictetus]], who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/epictetus.htm|title=Quotes for Therapy|author=|date=|website=www.getselfhelp.co.uk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the ''A-B-C''-''D-E-F'' model of [[psychological]] disturbance and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an ''A'', ''a''dversity (or ''a''ctivating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral ''C''s, ''c''onsequences, but also what people ''B'', irrationally ''b''elieve about the ''A'', ''a''dversity. ''A'', ''a''dversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.&lt;ref name="dryden1"&gt;Dryden W., &amp; Neenan M. (2003). Essential Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the following letters represent the following meanings in this model

A-	The adversity

B-	The developed belief in the person of the A Adversity

C-	The consequences but the consequences of that person's Beliefs ie B

D-	The person's disputes of A B and C. In latter thought.

E-	The effective new philosophy or belief that develops in that person through the occurrence of D in their minds of A and B

F-	The developed feelings of ones self either at point and after point C or at point after point E.


The ''B''s, irrational beliefs that are most important in the ''A-B-C'' model are explicit and implicit philosophical meanings and assumptions about events, personal desires, and preferences. The ''B''s, ''b''eliefs that are most significant are highly evaluative and consist of interrelated and integrated cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects and dimensions. According to REBT, if a person's evaluative ''B'', ''b''elief about the ''A'', ''a''ctivating event is rigid, absolutistic, fictional and dysfunctional, the ''C'', the emotional and behavioral ''c''onsequence, is likely to be self-defeating and destructive. Alternatively, if a person's belief is preferential, flexible and constructive, the ''C'', the emotional and behavioral ''c''onsequence is likely to be self-helping and constructive.

Through REBT, by understanding the role of their mediating, evaluative and philosophically based illogical, unrealistic and self-defeating meanings, interpretations and assumptions in disturbance, individuals can learn to identify them, then go to ''D'', ''d''isputing and questioning the evidence for them. At ''E, e''ffective new philosophy, they can recognize and reinforce the notion no evidence exists for any psychopathological ''must'', ''ought'' or ''should'' and distinguish them from healthy constructs, and subscribe to more constructive and self-helping philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert. (1994). Reason and Emotion In Psychotherapy, Revised and Updated. Secaucus, NJ: Carol Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt; This new reasonable perspective leads to ''F'', new ''f''eelings and behaviors appropriate to the ''A'' they are addressing in the exercise.

The REBT framework assumes that humans have both innate rational (meaning self-helping, socially helping, and constructive) and irrational (meaning self-defeating, socially defeating, and unhelpful) tendencies and leanings. REBT claims that people to a large degree consciously and unconsciously construct emotional difficulties such as [[self-blame]], [[self-pity]], clinical anger, hurt, guilt, shame, [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[anxiety]], and behaviors and behavior tendencies like [[procrastination]], compulsiveness, avoidance, [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and [[Social withdrawal|withdrawal]] by the means of their irrational and self-defeating thinking, [[emotion|emoting]] and behaving.&lt;ref name="ellis3"&gt;Ellis, A. (2001). Feeling better, getting better, staying better. Impact Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; REBT is then applied as an [[education]]al process in which the therapist often active-directively teaches the client how to identify irrational and self-defeating beliefs and philosophies which in nature are rigid, extreme, unrealistic, illogical and absolutist, and then to forcefully and actively question and dispute them and replace them with more rational and self-helping ones. By using different cognitive, emotive and behavioral [[Methodology|methods]] and activities, the client, together with help from the therapist and in [[Homework in psychotherapy|homework]] exercises, can gain a more rational, self-helping and constructive rational way of thinking, emoting and behaving. One of the main [[Goal|objective]]s in REBT is to show the client that whenever unpleasant and unfortunate activating events occur in people's lives, they have a [[choice]] of making themselves feel healthily and self-helpingly sorry, disappointed, frustrated, and annoyed, or making themselves feel unhealthily and self-defeatingly horrified, terrified, panicked, depressed, self-hating and self-pitying.&lt;ref name="ellis2"&gt;Ellis, Albert (2003). Early theories and practices of rational emotive behavior theory and how they have been augmented and revised during the last three decades. Journal of Rational-Emotive &amp; Cognitive-Behavior Therapy, 21(3/4)&lt;/ref&gt; By attaining and ingraining a more rational and self-constructive philosophy of themselves, others and the world, people often are more likely to behave and [[emotion|emote]] in more life-serving and adaptive ways.

Albert Ellis&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt; posits three major insights of REBT:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Insight 1''' – People seeing and accepting the reality that their emotional disturbances at point C are only partially caused by the activating events or adversities at point A that precede C. Although A contributes to C, and although disturbed Cs (such as feelings of [[panic]] and [[clinical depression|depression]]) are much more likely to follow strong negative As (such as being assaulted or raped), than they are to follow weak As (such as being disliked by a stranger), the main or more direct cores of extreme and dysfunctional emotional disturbances (Cs) are people’s irrational beliefs — the "absolutistic" (inflexible) "musts" and their accompanying inferences and attributions that people strongly believe about the activating event.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Insight 2''' – No matter how, when, and why people acquire self-defeating or irrational beliefs (i.e. beliefs that are the main cause of their dysfunctional emotional-behavioral consequences), if they are disturbed in the present, they tend to keep holding these irrational beliefs and continue upsetting themselves with these thoughts. They do so not because they held them in the past, but because they still actively hold them in the present (often unconsciously), while continuing to reaffirm their beliefs and act as if they are still valid. In their minds and hearts, the troubled people still follow the core "musturbatory" philosophies they adopted or invented long ago, or ones they recently accepted or constructed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Insight 3''' – No matter how well they have gained insights 1 and 2, insight alone rarely enables people to undo their emotional disturbances. They may feel better when they know, or think they know, how they became disturbed, because insights can feel useful and curative. But it is unlikely that people will actually get better and stay better unless they have and apply insight 3, which is that ''there is usually no way to get better and stay better except by continual work and practice in looking for and finding one’s core irrational beliefs''; actively, energetically, and scientifically disputing them; replacing one’s absolute "musts" (rigid requirements about how things should be) with more flexible ''preferences''; changing one's unhealthy feelings to healthy, self-helping emotions; and firmly acting against one’s dysfunctional [[fears]] and [[compulsive behavior|compulsions]]. Only by a combined cognitive, emotive, and behavioral, as well as a quite persistent and forceful attack on one's serious emotional problems, is one likely to significantly ameliorate or remove them, and keep them removed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Insight 4 – That in order for point D to occur in ones life often circumstances need to occur or transpire in order for the dispute in ones self and ones own emotions to happen. This way the dispute is reinforced by actions taken by the self if the action is strong enough. However if this is not executed by others with the person in affect not aware of what is going on the situation could become dangerous or life threatening by the person being treated.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding cognitive-affective-behavioral [[cognitive processes|process]]es in mental functioning and dysfunctioning, originator Albert Ellis explains:&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"REBT assumes that human thinking, emotion, and action are not really separate or disparate processes, but that they all significantly overlap and are rarely experienced in a pure state. Much of what we call emotion is nothing more nor less than a certain kind — a biased, prejudiced, or strongly evaluative kind — of thought. But emotions and behaviors significantly influence and affect thinking, just as thinking influences emotions and behaviors. Evaluating is a fundamental characteristic of human [[organisms]] and seems to work in a kind of closed [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] with a [[feedback mechanism]]: First, [[perception]] [[bias]]es response, and then response tends to bias subsequent perception. Also, prior perceptions appear to bias subsequent [[perception]]s, and prior responses appear to bias subsequent responses. What we call feelings almost always have a pronounced evaluating or appraisal element."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

REBT then generally proposes that many of these self-defeating cognitive, emotive and behavioral tendencies are both innately [[biology|biological]] and [[indoctrination|indoctrinated]] early in and during life, and further grow stronger as a person continually revisits, clings and acts on them. Ellis alludes to similarities between REBT and the [[general semantics]] when explaining the role of irrational beliefs in self-defeating tendencies, citing [[Alfred Korzybski]] as a significant modern influence on this thinking.&lt;ref&gt;"REBT particularly follows Korzybski in this respect..." Albert Ellis in ''The Albert Ellis reader: A guide to well-being using rational emotive behavior therapy'', p. 306. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LorJYkPSQOwC&amp;vq Google Books preview] retrieved August 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

REBT differs from other clinical approaches like [[psychoanalysis]] in that it places little emphasis on exploring the past, but instead focuses on changing the current evaluations and philosophical thinking-emoting and behaving in relation to themselves, others and the conditions under which people live.

== Psychological dysfunction ==
One of the main pillars of REBT is that irrational and dysfunctional ways and patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving are contributing to much, though hardly all, human disturbance and emotional and behavioral self-defeatism and social defeatism. REBT generally teaches that when people turn flexible preferences, desires and wishes into grandiose, absolutistic and fatalistic dictates, this tends to contribute to disturbance and upset. These dysfunctional patterns are examples of [[cognitive distortions]].

===Core beliefs that disturb humans===
Albert Ellis has suggested three core beliefs or philosophies that humans tend to disturb themselves through:&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ''"I absolutely MUST, under practically all conditions and at all times, perform well (or outstandingly well) and win the approval (or complete love) of significant others. If I fail in these important—and sacred—respects, that is awful and I am a bad, incompetent, unworthy person, who will probably always fail and deserves to suffer."''
| ''"Other people with whom I relate or associate, absolutely MUST, under practically all conditions and at all times, treat me nicely, considerately and fairly. Otherwise, it is terrible and they are rotten, bad, unworthy people who will always treat me badly and do not deserve a good life and should be severely punished for acting so abominably to me."''
| ''"The conditions under which I live absolutely MUST, at practically all times, be favorable, safe, hassle-free, and quickly and easily enjoyable, and if they are not that way it's awful and horrible and I can't bear it. I can't ever enjoy myself at all. My life is impossible and hardly worth living."''
|-
| Holding this belief when faced with adversity tends to contribute to feelings of [[anxiety]], [[panic]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], and worthlessness.
| Holding this belief when faced with adversity tends to contribute to feelings of anger, rage, fury, and vindictiveness.
| Holding this belief when faced with adversity tends to contribute to [[frustration]] and discomfort, [[Toleration|intolerance]], self-pity, [[anger]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and to behaviors such as [[procrastination]], [[avoidance coping|avoidance]], addictive behaviors and inaction.
|}

===Rigid demands that humans make===
REBT commonly posits that at the core of irrational beliefs there often are explicit or implicit rigid demands and commands, and that extreme [[derivative]]s like awfulizing, frustration [[Toleration|intolerance]], people [[deprecation]] and over-generalizations are accompanied by these.&lt;ref name="dryden1"/&gt; According to REBT the core dysfunctional philosophies in a person's evaluative emotional and behavioral belief system, are also very likely to contribute to unrealistic, arbitrary and crooked inferences and distortions in thinking. REBT therefore first teaches that when people in an insensible and devout way overuse absolutistic, [[dogma]]tic and rigid "shoulds", "musts", and "oughts", they tend to disturb and upset themselves.

===Over-generalization===
Further REBT generally posits that disturbed evaluations to a large degree occur through over-generalization, wherein people exaggerate and globalize events or traits, usually unwanted events or traits or behavior, out of context, while almost always ignoring the positive events or traits or behaviors. For example, awfulizing is partly [[mind|mental]] [[magnification]] of the importance of an unwanted situation to a [[Disaster|catastrophe]] or [[Horror and terror|horror]], elevating the rating of something from bad to worse than it should be, to beyond totally bad, worse than bad to the intolerable and to a "[[holocaust]]". The same exaggeration and overgeneralizing occurs with human rating, wherein humans come to be arbitrarily and [[axiom]]atically [[definition|defined]] by their [[perceive]]d flaws or misdeeds. Frustration intolerance then occurs when a person perceives something to be too difficult, painful or tedious, and by doing so exaggerates these qualities beyond one's ability to cope with them.

===Secondary disturbances===
Essential to REBT theory is also the concept of secondary disturbances which people sometimes construct on top of their primary disturbance. As Ellis emphasizes:&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Because of their self-consciousness and their ability to think about their thinking, they can very easily disturb themselves about their disturbances and can also disturb themselves about their ineffective attempts to overcome their emotional disturbances.''"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Mental wellness ==
As would be expected, REBT argues that [[mind|mental]] wellness and [[mental health]] to a large degree results from an adequate amount of self-helping, flexible, logico-empirical ways of thinking, emoting and behaving.&lt;ref name="ellis3"/&gt; When a perceived undesired and stressful activating event occurs, and the individual is interpreting, evaluating and reacting to the situation rationally and self-helpingly, then the resulting consequence is, according to REBT, likely to be more healthy, constructive and functional. This does not by any means mean that a relatively un-disturbed person never experiences negative feelings, but REBT does hope to keep debilitating and un-healthy emotions and subsequent self-defeating behavior to a minimum. To do this, REBT generally promotes a flexible, un-dogmatic, self-helping and efficient belief system and constructive life philosophy about adversities and human desires and preferences.

REBT clearly acknowledges that people, in addition to disturbing themselves, also are innately [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivists]]. Because they largely upset themselves with their beliefs, emotions and behaviors, they can be helped to, in a [[multimodal therapy|multimodal]] manner, dispute and question these and develop a more workable, more self-helping set of constructs.

REBT generally teaches and promotes:
* That the concepts and philosophies of life of unconditional self-acceptance, other-acceptance, and life-acceptance are effective philosophies of life in achieving mental wellness and [[mental health]].
* That human beings are inherently fallible and imperfect and that they are better served by accepting their and other human being's totality and humanity, while at the same time they may not like some of their behaviors and characteristics. That they are better off not measuring their entire self or their "being" and give up the narrow, grandiose and ultimately destructive notion to give themselves any global rating or report card. This is partly because all humans are continually evolving and are far too complex to accurately rate; all humans do both self-defeating / socially defeating and self-helping / socially helping deeds, and have both beneficial and un-beneficial attributes and traits at certain times and in certain conditions. REBT holds that [[idea]]s and feelings about self-worth are largely definitional and are not empirically confirmable or [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]].
* That people had better accept life with its hassles and difficulties not always in accordance with their wants, while trying to change what they can change and live as elegantly as possible with what they cannot change.

==REBT intervention==
As explained, REBT is a therapeutic system of both theory and practice; generally one of the goals of REBT is to help clients see the ways in which they have learned how they often needlessly upset themselves, teach them how to "un-upset" themselves and then how to [[empowerment|empower]] themselves to lead happier and more fulfilling lives.&lt;ref name="ellis1"/&gt; The emphasis in therapy is generally to establish a successful collaborative therapeutic working alliance based on the REBT educational model. Although REBT teaches that the therapist or counsellor is better served by demonstrating unconditional other-acceptance or unconditional positive regard, the therapist is not necessarily always encouraged to build a warm and caring relationship with the client. The tasks of the therapist or counselor include understanding the client’s concerns from his point of reference and work as a facilitator, teacher and encourager.

In traditional REBT, the client together with the therapist, in a structured active-directive manner, often work through a set of target problems and establish a set of therapeutic goals. In these target problems, situational dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and beliefs are [[Psychological assessment|assessed]] in regards to the client's [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[goal]]s. After working through these problems, the client learns to generalize insights to other relevant situations. In many cases after going through a client's different target problems, the therapist is interested in examining possible core beliefs and more deep rooted philosophical evaluations and schemas that might account for a wider array of problematic emotions and behaviors.&lt;ref name="dryden1"/&gt; Although REBT much of the time is used as a brief therapy, in deeper and more complex problems, longer therapy is promoted.

In therapy, the first step often is that the client acknowledges the problems, accepts emotional responsibility for these and has willingness and determination to change. This normally requires a considerable amount of insight, but as originator [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]]&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt; explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Humans, unlike just about all the other animals on earth, create fairly sophisticated [[languages]] which not only enable them to think about their feeling, their actions, and the results they get from doing and not doing certain things, but they also are able to think about their thinking and even [[metacognition|think about thinking about their thinking]]."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Through the therapeutic process, REBT employs a wide array of forceful and active, meaning [[multimodal therapy|multimodal]] and disputing, [[methodology|methodologies]]. Central through these methods and techniques is the intent to help the client challenge, dispute and question their destructive and self-defeating cognitions, emotions and behaviors. The methods and techniques incorporate cognitive-philosophic, emotive-evocative-dramatic, and behavioral methods for disputation of the client's irrational and self-defeating constructs and helps the client come up with more rational and self-constructive ones. REBT seeks to acknowledge that understanding and insight are not enough; in order for clients to significantly change, they need to pinpoint their irrational and self-defeating [[Philosophy of artificial intelligence|constructs]] and work forcefully and actively at changing them to more functional and self-helping ones.

REBT posits that the client must work hard to get better, and in therapy this normally includes a wide array of homework exercises in day-to-day life assigned by the therapist. The [[assignment (education)|assignment]]s may for example include [[desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]] tasks, i.e., by having the client confront the very thing he or she is afraid of. By doing so, the client is actively acting against the belief that often is contributing significantly to the disturbance.

Another factor contributing to the brevity of REBT is that the therapist seeks to empower the client to help himself through future adversities. REBT only promotes temporary solutions if more fundamental solutions are not found. An ideal successful [[collaboration]] between the REBT therapist and a client results in changes to the client's philosophical way of evaluating himself or herself, others, and his or her life, which will likely yield effective results. The client then moves toward unconditional self-acceptance, other-acceptance and life-acceptance while striving to live a more self-fulfilling and happier life.

== Efficacy ==
REBT and CBT in general have a substantial and strong [[research]] base to verify and support both their psychotherapeutic efficiency and their theoretical underpinnings. A great quantity of scientific empirical studies has proven REBT to be an effective and efficient treatment for many kinds of psychopathology, conditions and problems.&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, L. C., &amp; Woods, P. J. (1991). The efficacy of rational-emotive therapy: A quantitative review of the outcome research. Clinical Psychology Review, 11, 357–369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="feltham"&gt;Colin Feltham (ed) (1997). Which Psychotherapy?: Leading Exponents Explain Their Differences. SAGE, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper M. (2008). Essential Research Findings in Counselling and Psychotherapy. Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; A vast amount of outcome and experimental studies support the effectiveness of REBT and CBT.&lt;ref&gt;Philosophy in Psychotherapy: [http://www.intuition.org/txt/ellis.htm Albert Ellis interview by Jeffrey Mishlove]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Psychotherapy.net: [http://www.psychotherapy.net/interview/Albert_Ellis Albert Ellis Behavioral Therapy Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225020622/http://www.psychotherapy.net/interview/Albert_Ellis |date=2008-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, REBT randomized clinical trials have offered a positive view on the efficacy of REBT.&lt;ref name="david"&gt;David D. et al. (2005). A synopsis of rational-emotive behavior therapy: Fundamental and applied research. Journal of rational-emotive and cognitive-behavior therapy 2005, vol. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In general REBT is arguably one of the most investigated [[theory|theories]] in the field of psychotherapy and a large amount of clinical experience and a substantial body of modern psychological research have validated and substantiated many of REBTs theoretical assumptions on [[Personality psychology|personality]] and psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="feltham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"&gt;Ellis A., Abrams M. &amp; Abrams L. (2008). Theories of Personality. Sage Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and critique ==
{{See also|Cognitive behavioral therapy#Criticisms|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
The clinical research on REBT has been criticized both from within and by others. For instance, originator [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] has on occasions emphasized the difficulty and complexity of measuring psychotherapeutic effectiveness, because many studies only tend to [[Psychometrics|measure]] whether clients merely feel better after therapy instead of them getting better and staying better.&lt;ref name="ellis3"/&gt; Ellis has also criticized studies for having limited focus primarily to [[cognitive restructuring]] aspects, as opposed to the combination of cognitive, emotive and behavioral aspects of REBT.&lt;ref name="feltham"/&gt; As REBT has been subject to criticisms during its existence, especially in its early years, REBT theorists have a long history of publishing and addressing those concerns. It has also been argued by Ellis and by other clinicians that REBT theory on numerous occasions has been misunderstood and misconstrued both in research and in general.&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;

Some have criticized REBT for being harsh, formulaic and failing to address deep underlying problems.&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; REBT theorists have argued in reply that a careful study of REBT shows that it is both philosophically deep, humanistic and individualized collaboratively working on the basis of the client’s point of reference.&lt;ref name="ellis1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; They have further argued that REBT utilizes an integrated and interrelated methodology of cognitive, emotive-experiential and behavioral interventions.&lt;ref name="ellis1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="feltham"/&gt; Others have questioned REBTs view of rationality, both radical constructivists who have claimed that reason and logic are subjective properties and those who believe that reason can be objectively determined.&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; REBT theorists have argued in reply that REBT raises objections to clients' irrational choices and conclusions as a working hypothesis and through collaborative efforts demonstrate the irrationality on practical, functional and social consensual grounds.&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; In 1998 when asked what the main criticism on REBT was, Albert Ellis replied that it was the claim that it was too rational and not dealing sufficiently enough with emotions. He repudiated the claim by saying that REBT on the contrary emphasizes that thinking, feeling, and behaving are interrelated and integrated, and that it includes a vast amount of both emotional and behavioural methods in addition to cognitive ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ask Dr. Ellis Achieve (1996–2001). Albert Ellis Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis has himself in very direct terms criticized opposing approaches such as [[psychoanalysis]], [[transpersonal psychology]] and abreactive psychotherapies in addition to on several occasions questioning some of the [[doctrine]]s in certain religious systems, [[spiritualism]] and [[mysticism]]. Many, including REBT practitioners, have warned against [[dogma]]tizing and sanctifying REBT as a supposedly perfect psychological [[panacea]]. Prominent REBTers have promoted the importance of high quality and programmatic research, including originator Ellis, a self-proclaimed "passionate skeptic". He has on many occasions been open to challenges and acknowledged errors and inefficiencies in his approach and concurrently revised his theories and practices.&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; In general, with regard to cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies' [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]]s, others have pointed out that as about 30–40% of people are still unresponsive to interventions, that REBT could be a platform of reinvigorating empirical studies on the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral models of psychopathology and human functioning.&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;

REBT has been developed, revised and augmented through the years as understanding and knowledge of psychology and psychotherapy have progressed. This includes its theoretical concepts, practices and methodology. The teaching of scientific thinking, reasonableness and [[Dogma|un-dogmatism]] has been inherent in REBT as an approach, and these ways of thinking are an inextricable part of REBT's [[empiricism|empirical]] and [[skepticism|skeptical]] nature.

==Applications and interfaces==
Applications and interfaces of REBT are used with a broad range of clinical problems in traditional psychotherapeutic settings such as individual-, [[Group psychotherapy|group]]- and [[family therapy]]. It is used as a general treatment for a vast number of different conditions and psychological problems normally associated with [[psychotherapy]].

In addition, REBT is used with non-clinical problems and problems of living through [[counselling]], consultation and coaching settings dealing with problems including relationships, social skills, career changes, [[stress management]], assertiveness training, grief, problems with aging, money, weight control etc.

REBT also has many interfaces and applications through self-help resources, phone and internet counseling, workshops &amp; seminars, workplace and educational programmes, etc. This includes Rational Emotive Education (REE) where REBT is applied in education settings, Rational Effectiveness Training in business and work-settings and [[SMART Recovery]] (Self Management And Recovery Training) in supporting those in addiction recovery, in addition to a wide variety of specialized treatment strategies and applications.

The '''Sansi language''', ''Sansiboli'', or '''Bhilki''', is a highly [[endangered language|endangered]] [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] of the [[List of Central Indo-Aryan languages|Central]] group. The language is spoken by the nomadic [[Sansi (nomadic)|Sansi]] people.

''[[Ethnologue]]'' sees it as a [[Hindustani language]] ([[Western Hindi]]).&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; Some sources also mention it as a dialect of the [[Rajasthani language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languageinindia.com/dec2002/sansi.html Language in India: Endangered Language: A Case Study of Sansiboli]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Glottolog'' links it to [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. Kabutra, spoken by a thousand people in Pakistan, is mutually intelligible.

It is spoken by about sixty thousand speakers mainly in Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, and Delhi states of India.  As a language, Sansiboli is not confined to any particular [[geographical boundary]]. It has benefitted from various sources, absorbed regional colors, and imbibed influence from neighboring languages and dialects. Thus, it has numerous phonological and morphological [[borrowings]] from Punjabi, Hindi, and Marwari.

Sansiboli is not effectively being passed on to the next generation and is on the verge of extinction. Very few people below the age of forty are fully competent in the language, and probably none of them will become active speakers. Many of the Sansis are likely to mix Hindi, Punjabi, or Marwari elements in their speech depending on their geographical location.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6749">'''Scouting on the Isle of Man''' is represented by [[the Scout Association]] of the [[United Kingdom]].  The Scout Association's Island Headquarters are at Cunningham House in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]]. The association has its own campsite, Mullin ny Carty. Some of the Groups also have their own bunkhouses or campsites, in addition to their own headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manxscouts.com Scout Association - Isle of Man]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scout Association's Patron is the [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Paul Haddacks|Sir Paul Haddacks]], and its President is a former [[Chief Minister of the Isle of Man|Chief Minister]], [[Miles Walker|Sir Miles Walker]].

==History==
The 1st Malew Group were the first Scout Group on the Isle of Man. Originally called 1st Isle of Man, they renamed the group because other contingents had become active. The Scouts' scarf and name tag are in red and white reflecting the close relations to the [[Air Scouts]] that they were originally.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Close ties with Ireland==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
The Isle of Man has attracted [[Scouting Ireland|Irish Scouts]]. This was particularly the case under the patronage of Sir [[Charles Kerruish]] who facilitated the use of his own lands for Scout camping. Many groups fostered personal friendships with the [[Speaker of the House of Keys]]. In fact in 1979, as part of the island's celebration of the 1,000th anniversary of [[Tynwald]], Sir Charles invited Irish Scouts to form part of the [[guard of honour]] for the arrival of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. All uniformed personnel present, including the Irish guests received a specially minted medal from the Queen. It was seen a great honour that, on arguably the largest celebration ever on the island, the close link with Irish Scouting was emphasised, as they stood side by side with Manx Scouts and the large military presence who were there to honour both the island itself and the [[Lord of Mann]].

==World Scout Jamboree contingents==

In 2007 ten Manx Scouts and a Leader attended the [[21st World Scout Jamboree]] as part of the Cumbria and Isle of Man Unit.&lt;ref name="Manx Jamb"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.manxscouts.com/21st-world-scout-jamboree/ | title = 21st World Scout Jamboree Essex 2007 | work = Details of the members of Isle of Man Scouting who represented the island at the celebration of Scouting's centenary in 2007 | publisher = www.manxscouts.com | accessdate = 2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 nine Manx Scout and a Leader attended the [[22nd World Scout Jamboree]] as part of the contingent with Scouts from Cheshire.&lt;ref name="Manx Sweden"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.manxscouts.com/sweden-2011/ | title = 22nd World Scout Jamboree Sweden 2011 | work = Details of the members of the Jamboree and Isle of Man Scouting who represented the island in Sweden | publisher = www.manxscouts.com | accessdate = 2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 three Scouts and one Leader attended the [[23rd World Scout Jamboree]] in Japan as part of an Isle of Man/Merseyside contingent.&lt;ref name="Manx Japan"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.manxscouts.com/23rd-world-scout-jamboree/ | title = 23rd World Scout Jamboree Japan 2015 | work = Details of the members of the Jamboree and Isle of Man Scouting who represented the island in Japan | publisher = www.manxscouts.com | accessdate = 2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019 the World Scout Jamboree will be hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico.

==Three Legs Challenge==
The Three Legs Challenge is a hiking challenge open to all Scouts and [[Scout Network]] members. Those who undertake the challenge must walk 3 of the island's long distance walkways within 12 months. Its name is derived from the [[Isle of Man#The Triskelion|Triskelion]] that is the island's national symbol. The routes are:

* '''Leg One - The Heritage Way'''
Beginning at the Quarterbridge in Douglas and follow the [[Heritage Way]] along the disused Railway Line to [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]]. Finish is at the Peel Heritage Centre. &lt;br /&gt;
''Distance 10.5 miles.''

* '''Leg Two - Bayr ny Skeddan (Way of the Herring)'''
Start at Castle Rushen in Castletown and follow the [[Bayr ny Skeddan]] to Peel. Finish at [[Peel Castle]]. &lt;br /&gt;
''Distance 15 miles.''

* '''Leg Three - Millennium Way'''
Start at the bottom of Sky Hill, near [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] and follow the [[Millennium Way]] to Castletown. Finish at Castle Rushen. This hike can be completed in either one day or two consecutive days, camping overnight. &lt;br /&gt;
''Distance 26 miles.''

Hikes may be completed in any order, but all must be completed in the twelve-month period. It is possible to complete the hikes either way i.e. hike from [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]] to Sky Hill to complete the Millennium Way.

'''Shatt''' is an ethnic group in [[Sudan]] located in the northern Shatt Hills southwest of [[Kadugli]] in [[South Kordofan]] State (Shatt Daman, Shatt Safia, Shatt Tebeldia) and in the Abu Hashim and Abu Sinam areas.  They refer to themselves as the Caning people. They are one of seven distinct ethnicities comprising the [[Daju people]]. They speak [[Shatt language|Shatt]], a Nilo-Saharan language. Most members of this ethnic group are Muslims. The population of the Shatt exceeds 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=shj Ethnologue: Shatt people] retrieved May 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3339">'''Sigma Terra Corps''', '''Sigma TC''', is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[science fiction]] [[Club (organization)|club]], founded 5 December 1976 in [[Saltsjöbaden]] by [[Wolf von Witting]], Jörg Litschke and Johan Richter.

==History==
It was in the beginning one of many fan-clubs devoted to the German [[space opera]]-series [[Perry Rhodan]], but this changed early on to a more general interest in [[speculative fiction]]. The club peaked in 1982 with more than 220 members, in Germany and Sweden. Its German branch withered away by the end of the 1980s.

[[Ralph Lundsten]] became a member in 1979 and hosted several gatherings in his studio and home, Villa Frankenburg. He also composed the [[jingle]] for Sigma TC's radio show, which was broadcast on [[Stockholm]]'s local radio in 1982.

In 1980 the club initiated a sequence of local [[science fiction conventions]], NasaCon, running for 11 consecutive years. The name of the convention was an abbreviation of [[Nacka]] [[Saltsjöbaden]]s [[Fan convention|convention]]. [[Ralph Lundsten]] was "Guest of Honour" at the first event in 1980. NasaCon also featured the journalist Anders Palm in 1981, Lars-Olov Strandberg in 1984, Per Insulander in 1985, the author Jörgen Peterzén in 1986, [[Hans Arnold]] in 1987 and Norwegian author Oyvind Myhre in 1988. The main production behind the convention was done by [[Wolf von Witting]], George Bobjörk (both from 1980) and [[Ahrvid Engholm]] (from 1981 on).

NasaCon 11 was hosted in [[Nacka]] Conference Center on July 6-8th in 1990. Guests of Honour were [[Brian Aldiss]], [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] and [[Sam J Lundwall]]. During the years 1992-1996 all activities of the club were officially suspended, but many former members kept meeting simply out of common interests. This led to a re-launch of activities in 1997.

7-9 July 2000, NasaCon was also [[Swecon]], the national Swedish convention. Guests of Honour were [[Brian Stableford]] and [[John-Henri Holmberg]]. The convention was run in a joint operation with Stockholm [[Trekker (Star Trek)|Trekkers]]. The event received considerable attention in media, with covering reports on TV, radio and major newspapers.

Members of Sigma TC also collaborated on SWECON'83, SWECON'85, Junicon'99, Fantastika 2001 and Stocon 2002. After 2008 the activities in the club again went into decline.

==Special events==
* An exhibition about science fiction, in January 1987 at the library in [[Fisksätra]], with lectures among others by Swedish author Sten Andersson and [[Ahrvid Engholm]].

[[File:Earth's City Lights by DMSP, 1994-1995 (large).jpg|thumb|This photo shows a satellite image of [[light pollution]] and how much electricity is being used overnight around the earth.]]
Climate change has worsened at the hands of human activity for centuries, and many scientific efforts have been made since the first political acknowledgment. In order to avoid the ongoing and potential impacts of climate change, mitigation technologies have been developed in order to adapt to the issue, each invention belonging to one of four specific groups of effort. These groups include [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] improvements, [[renewable energy]] (RE), [[Nuclear power|nuclear power/energy]] (NE), and [[Carbon capture and storage|carbon capture storage]] (CCS).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/science/article/pii/S2214629617300397|title=Corporatization of the Climate? Innovation, Intellectual Property Rights, and Patents for Climate Change Mitigation|last=Raiser, Naims &amp; Bruhn|first=|date=January 30, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, concerns regarding mitigating and adapting to climate change commonly have a priority focus on the groups of carbon capture storage and renewable energy efforts.

Traditionally, areas of western civilization around the world have the resources and finances to successfully develop and maintain technological mitigators to climate change. The research and development of these technologies require funding and incur high costs. There is a global inconsistency in producing these inventions, leaving [[Developing country|developing countries]] without the means to defend themselves against the issue of climate change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ironically, some of these areas are powerless enough while being the most inflicted by climate change in the world.

Climate change was mentioned as early as 1896 by Swedish chemist, [[Svante Arrhenius]]. The topic did not emerge as a political issue until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_Arrhenius|title=Svante Arrhenius|last=Wikipedia|first=|date=February 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=February 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public policy]] is its own actor in the business of climate innovations through its control over the activity of emitting and reducing pollution inventions. Predominantly, [[legislature]] works to control the innovations particularly through placing restrictions on the amount of pollution that can be produced, and time crunches on when certain changes by companies using polluting inventions need to be completed by.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is up to the state that is implementing policy and the pollution-contributing businesses to work towards the implemented legal requirements in order to reach environmental goals by a set date.

== Political Influence ==

The beginning of the era to protect the environment started with [[common law]], founded in the law of [[Nuisance in English law|nuisance]]. This introduction solely allowed for the action of private work to improve land when harmed (including removing the smell from [[pig sty]]s, fixing broken dams, and enforcing [[strict liability]]). Any other enforcement was stringent to only deal with any major environmental threats, only being able to adequately protect the common resources. Profound regulation to protect the environment was first seen from England law, triggered by environmentally damaging events. Catastrophes such as the "[[Great Stink]]" (the dumping of sewage in a River Thames by parliament) ignited a movement in protective legislature to establish the [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wikipedia|title=Environmental law|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_law|website=Wikipedia|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the "[[Great Smog]]" (a massive buildup of air pollution) promoted the development of England’s [[Clean Air Act 1956]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The environmental regulations imposed limitations on the amount of emissions from household and business establishments that can be produced, and inspectorate forces to ensure compliance. “Environmental law” only became a distinct and separate body of legislature in all developed and many developing nations in the 1960s, upon the recognition that the [[natural environment]] is in desperate need of aid to sustain itself, being so fragile.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While state regulations are in place to reduce emissions in effort to protect the environment’s air quality, international initiatives have worked towards addressing the broader issues. For instance, the many chemicals that harm the [[ozone layer]] have been globally restricted to emit through the development of programs that focus on the trading of emissions (a focus reducing acid rain or adapting to climate change).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The programs also collaborate to identify and categorize air pollutants and state the acceptable level of emissions and necessary mitigation technologies.

Water quality is also a prominent topic with the concern of improving the environment, as the factor has a direct and immediate impact on the life around it. State regulations per nation implement policies regarding [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment and disposal]], as well as managing all [[Agricultural wastewater treatment|agricultural]] and [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial]] wastewater.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Legislatures also work to control the level of [[surface runoff]] that comes from construction sites in predominantly urban environments. Additionally, international efforts also look to identify and categorize water pollutants and state the acceptable concentration levels in water resources.

Moreover, policies are able to manage [[municipal solid waste]], [[hazardous waste]], and [[Radioactive waste|nuclear waste]], among [[List of waste types|many other types]] through governance of its transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In terms of containment clearance (of [[sediment]], [[soil]], [[Surface water|surface]], and [[ground water]]), there are policies that work as a protective, rather than preventative measure. They are administered through response actions that are vital to repairing damaged media of the environment. Not only are policies needed for improvements, but as well the effort by people to undertake responsibility or pay for it. Governed actions include emergency response services, liability allocation, assessing the site, remedial investigation and action, feasibility studies, site reuse, and post-remedial monitoring.

Finally, laws that govern man-made chemical safety from modern industrial application include the management of human activities. These policies strictly work to ban some chemical pollutants (particularly in consumer products, such as [[Bisphenol A]] material in plastic bottles) and regulate [[pesticides]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Scientific Background ==

Technological change and scientific processes play an important role through research, inspiring the creation, distribution and exploitation of knowledge. These scientific advances improve technological innovation for climate change mitigation. They are vital to use in strategizing methods to adaptation, being necessary while climate change threatens the world. Presently national technology systems focus on growth in jobs and output, instead of reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Adaptation strategies are meant to reduce any vulnerability of available technologies and the need for adaptation at all with scientific technologies including [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] improvements, and production of [[renewable energy]] (RE), [[Nuclear power|nuclear power/energy]] (NE), and [[Carbon capture and storage|carbon capture storage]] (CCS).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Energy Efficiency Improvements ===

[[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] is a concept used to define the focus of tackling climate change by creating energy efficient technologies and products (they are meant to use less energy to provide the same service). Energy efficiency is an important tool for climate adaptation because it preserves and extends resources in the long-run. It also minimizes the costs for the state in adapting the energy sector for climate change. The least costly way to meet the increased demand for energy is by saving energy. However, developing countries struggle with the trade-off between energy efficiency and economic performance in keeping up with their expanding economies, since they require large increases in [[Energy development|energy]] production and consumption.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Improving energy efficiency does not only include the effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It varies and depends on the energy being supplied for the particular technology, such as fossil fuels from a [[coal]]-fired plant that produces [[gasoline]] for cars. Improved efficiency will cut emissions for fossil fueled technologies compared to [[Low-carbon power|low carbon]] sources, such as [[electricity]] which is produced from renewable energy. Nonetheless, improving energy efficiency is a key tool for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and most low carbon sources (which includes renewable energy and carbon capture storage).

=== Renewable Energy (RE) ===

[[Renewable energy]] is generated from [[natural resource]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt;, such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], and [[rain]]. Renewable technologies function from resources that vary from [[solar power]], [[wind power]], to [[hydroelectricity]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and are constantly renewed. Renewable energy technologies have an advantage over conventional energy systems, as they have a much lower impact on the environment and are considered a clean source of energy. A disadvantage to using renewable energy includes the source’s unstable market, with uncertain profitability from the competition of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The energy source therefore is not in a likely position to gain much support from the state and [[private sector]]. Renewable sources are being encouraged to address the issues and challenges that arise from greenhouse gas inflictions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most renewable energy technologies are generated from sunlight, which creates solar energy (power). This solar energy is the most efficient renewable resource on the planet, predominantly generating electricity but also sourcing power for the purposes of heating and water purification.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Solar energy is conducted using heat from the sun, which is absorbed by wind turbines, in capturing wind that generates wind power. The use of solar renewable technologies plays a large roll in emission reduction for mitigating climate change, reducing air pollution and addressing concerns with energy security.

=== Nuclear Energy (NE) ===

[[Nuclear power]] is conducted by the released nuclear energy from nuclear reactions. The power is ignited heat from reactions, which is most commonly used in the powering of electricity-producing steam turbines, located in nuclear [[power plant]]s&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power|title=Nuclear Power|last=Wikipedia|first=|date=March 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;. [[Nuclear fission]] is a type of nuclear reaction that is a leading form of [[low carbon power generation]]. The commercialization of entire power stations was first introduced in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Entire [[power stations]] that are run by fission-electricity are known to have emission values that are lower than that of renewable energy stations in terms of a greenhouse gas emissions per cycle (of a generated unit of energy). The median value of all commercial sources for [[baseload]] energy is lowest for this method and second to lowest for all technologies of commercial electricity. The first establishments of these plants prevented 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, emitted by the thermal power stations that burn fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Nuclear power is acclaimed by the [[World Nuclear Association]] and [[Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy]] to be the safe and sustainable energy source in reducing carbon emissions. Retrospectively, the corporations of [[Greenpeace International]] and [[Nuclear Information and Resource Service|NIRS]] are known to be opposed to nuclear power, arguing that it threatens the environment more than anything.

=== Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) ===

[[Carbon dioxide]] is a major greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, and its levels have increased from human activity, promoting incidents such as fossil fuel [[combustion]]. One of the main technologies meant for reducing carbon dioxide emissions is [[Carbon capture and storage|carbon capture storage]] (CCS). This involves the absorption of carbon dioxide to prevent it from entering the [[atmosphere]] from emitting sources, such as [[natural gas]] processing plants or [[power plant]]s&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;. Carbon capture storage is a technology that can capture up to 90 percent of carbon dioxide emissions that result from the use of fossil fuels in [[Electricity generation|generating electricity]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;or industrial processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fossil fuels impact the environment when combusted in quantities that restrict the ability to stabilize safe levels of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Carbon capture storage involves a three-step process of acquiring the carbon dioxide, transporting it, and securely storing it away. First, the technology separates the carbon dioxide from the gases produced in the [[electricity generation]] or industrial processes in methods of  pre-combustion captures, [[post combustion capture]], or [[oxy-fuel combustion]]. Then, the separated carbon dioxide is transported for safe storage via either pipeline or ship. The carbon dioxide is stored carefully in depleted [[natural gas field]]s or selected [[Geologic formation|geologic rock formations]] underground, that are usually located a few kilometres underneath the earth’s surface. The further development of advances in carbon capture technologies means for more success in future capture processes. The main barrier is the cost and efficiency issues of capturing carbon dioxide from power generation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Economic Factors ===
Economic factors need to be taken into account when determining the current and expected future improvements of technologies for climate change adaptation. The economic factors, which are described through the [[supply and demand]] chain, are important for understanding the rate and direction of the progresses of technological change. The state determines the supply, based on the relevant scientific and technological knowledge and opportunity. As well, the state assesses the costs and availability of resources, such as the trained technicians and experienced workers that are involved in the research processes to create and improve climate change adaptation technologies.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Whereas, the demand for innovation depends on the amount of cost reduction from the particular technology being used, as well as the consumer and producer benefit from a new or improved technology for existing goods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Technologies for climate change mitigation are meant to create energy efficient products and services that result in economic benefits to its consumers and to the environment. The state can track energy efficiency improvements through the policies that regulate prices in markets.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In an economic perspective, greenhouse gas emissions are considered ‘externalities’ that are not fully traded and priced in markets, lacking credible [[market value]]. Addressing climate change becomes an issue for society and cannot be achieved simply from the progresses of private markets, consumers and producers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Issues such as, directly regulating personal choices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will require the government to outlaw large cars, raise carbon or [[fossil fuel]] taxes, and even increase public transit spending. Furthermore, subsidising production and [[diffusion]] throughout society is politically less challenging because technological innovation is substantial to economic growth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Energy efficiency improvements directly affect the consumers (i.e. in 2016, the Canadian government helped citizens’ save $12 billion in energy costs in 2013, accumulating an average savings of $869 per household).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

For technological innovation to achieve economic sustainability, an economy would have to ensure responsible and limited use of natural resources that are non-renewable or not harmful to the environment, such as fossil fuels or [[uranium]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A sustainable economy uses various strategies for engaging optimal resources, to achieve a beneficial balance in the long term. Presently, there is technology already existing that can effectively reduce and even stabilize greenhouse gas levels within the next few decades. However, the issue is that it is economically and politically difficult to initiate and install energy efficient products, using renewable energy sources (i.e. [[wind power]]). Social and political barriers limit the progress of implementing technologies and meeting the demands of effective climate change mitigation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Release==

Both volumes of ''Governance of China'' were formally presented to western audiences at the [[London Book Fair]] upon their releases,&lt;ref name="timeslit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gcd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dialogue.global-china.org/cms.php?artid=1041&amp;catid=701 |title=Helping with the book launch of ''The Governance of China by Xi Jinping'' |website=Global China Dialogue |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both volumes have been translated into other major languages apart from Chinese, including English, Arabic, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/world/china-watch/culture/xi-jinpings-book-on-policy/ |title=Influence of Xi Jinping book spreads with editions in more languages |date=24 May 2017 |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]; [[China Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gbtimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gbtimes.com/second-volume-of-xi-jinpings-book-launched-in-eight-foreign-languages |title=Second volume of Xi Jinping's book launched in eight foreign languages |last=Jessup |first=Catherine |date=11 April 2018 |website=gbtimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital versions of volume I in Chinese and English are available on digital trade platforms including [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[OverDrive, Inc.|OverDrive]], CNPeReading and iReader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-07/06/c_137306646.htm|title=Chinese, English editions of Xi's book on governance of country go digital|website=[[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]]|date=2018-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Reviews of ''Governance of China'' have been mixed, including positive reception from Chinese officials,&lt;ref name="ciic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/2017-12/22/content_50120289.htm |title=Wang Huning stresses importance of Xi's second book on governance |date=22 December 2017 |website=''china.org.cn''}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured praise from non-Chinese leaders,&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/china/2018/04/26/xi-jinpings-new-blockbuster-is-getting-a-hard-sell |title=Xi Jinping's new blockbuster is getting a hard sell |date=26 April 2018 |website=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and negative reviews in Western media, where the work is sometimes regarded as propaganda.&lt;ref name="foreign"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/05/we-read-xi-jinpings-book-so-you-dont-have-to/ |title=We Read Xi Jinping's Book So You Don't Have To |last=Allen-Ebrahimian |first=Bethany |date=5 February 2015 |website=[[Foreign Policy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techaeris"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techaeris.com/2014/12/08/mark-zuckerberg-reportedly-buying-governance-china-employees/ |title=Mark Zuckerberg Reportedly Buying 'The Governance of China' For Employees |last=Hernandez |first=Alex |date=8 December 2014 |website=Techaeris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] is reported to have read the book, and to have ordered copies for the company's employees.  Zuckerberg's interest in the book has been interpreted as a [[Vested interest (communication theory)|vested interest]]; Facebook is [[Internet censorship in China|blocked in China]], and if the block were lifted, the potential result would be a dramatic increase in Facebook's userbase.&lt;ref name="techaeris" /&gt;

Although Chinese media have reported global circulation numbers for the book's volumes on the order of several million copies,&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt; Western media have also reported very low sales numbers for the work in Western countries.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3827869/china-president-xi-jinping-book-bestseller/ |title=Is Chinese President Xi Jinping's Book of Speeches Really a Best Seller? |last=Beech |first=Hannah |date=20 April 2015 |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"There may not be very many readers outside China. The publisher claims the second volume has a global circulation of 13m. But, according to Scott Morton of Nielsen Bookscan, a data provider, fewer than 100 copies of the English-language version of the second volume have actually been sold in Britain since it was published in November. Sales are slightly higher in Australia, at 124. The first volume has not performed much better: 588 copies in Britain and 430 in Australia. It is likely that freebies of both volumes hugely exceed the number of copies sold to individuals. Finding foreigners who have actually read Xi’s magnum opus is about as easy as finding thigh-slapping jokes in it."&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;}}

'''Wakhi''' is an [[Indo-European language]] in the [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]] branch of the language family spoken today in [[Wakhan District]], [[Afghanistan]] and also in Northern [[Pakistan]], China, and Tajikistan.

==Classification and distribution==
Wakhi is one of several languages that belong to the [[Language area|areal]] [[Pamir languages|Pamir]] language group. Its relationship to the other Iranian languages is not clear; in certain features Wakhi shows affinity to the extinct [[Saka language]] in particular.

The [[Wakhi people]] are occasionally called [[Pamiri people|Pamiris]] and Guhjali. The origin of this language is [[Wakhan]] and it is, according to many sources,{{which|date=December 2013}} more than four thousand years old. It is spoken by the inhabitants of the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan, parts of [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] (the former NAs) of Pakistan, Gorno-Badkhshan (mountainous-Badakhshan, in Russian) region of Tajakistan, and Xinjiang in western [[China]]. The Wakhi use the self-appellation ‘X̌ik’ (ethnic) and suffix it with ‘wor’/’war’ to denote their language as ‘X̌ik-wor’ themselves. The noun ‘X̌ik’ comes from ''*waxša-ī̆ka-'' (an inhabitant of ''*Waxša-'' ‘Oxus’, for Wakhan, in Wakhi ‘Wux̌’. There are other equivalents for the name Wakhi (Anglicised) or Wakhani (Arabic and Persian), Vakhantsy (Russian), Gojali/Gojo (Dingrik-wor/Shina), Guyits/Guicho (Borushaski), Wakhigi/Wakhik-war (Kivi-wor/Khow-wor) and Cert (Turki). The language belongs, as yet to be confirmed according to studies and sources, to the southern group of the Pamir languages, in the Iranian group of the Indo-European family (450) of languages, where the different Ishkashmi, Shighni/…nani and Wakhi languages are included. A very rough estimate of the population of Wakhis is 58,000 worldwide. The Wakhi live in six different countries. In the Gilgit–Baltistan region of [[Pakistan]], the Wakhi people mainly live in [[Gojal]], [[Ishkoman]], [[Darkut]] and in Chitral District's [[Broghol]]. They also live in some parts of [[Wakhan]] in [[Afghanistan]], [[Gorno-Badakhshan]] in [[Tajikistan]], [[Xinjiang]] in [[China]], [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]]

===In Afghanistan===
In the [[Wakhan Corridor]] of Afghanistan, Wakhi is spoken from [[Putur, Afghanistan|Putur]], near [[Ishkashim, Afghanistan|Ishkashim]], to the upper reaches of the [[Wakhan River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Payne | first=John |editor-first=Rüdiger | editor-last=Schmitt |title=Compendium Linguarum Iranicum |publisher=Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag |year=1989 |location=Wiesbaden |pages=419 |chapter=Pamir Languages |isbn=3-88226-413-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Tajikistan===
In Tajikistan the Wakhi and other communities that speak one of the [[Pamir languages]] refer to themselves as [[Pamiri people|Pamiri]] or [[Pamiri people|Badakhshani]] and there has been a movement to separate their identity from that of the majority [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking [[Tājik people|Tajiks]]. [[Linguistics|Linguists]] universally refer to Wakhi as an [[Eastern Iranian languages|East Iranian language]] independent of Tajik Persian, but many Tajik [[nationalists]] insist that Wakhi and other Pamir languages are actually dialects of Tajik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Viires |first=Ants |author2=Lauri Vahtre |title=The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire |publisher=NGO Red Book |year=2001 |location=Tallinn
|url=http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/index1.shtml |isbn=9985-9369-2-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Pakistan ===
In [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] Wakhi is spoken in the sparsely populated upper portions of five of the northernmost valleys: [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]] (many ethnic Wakhi of this valley now speak [[Burushaski]]), [[Gojal]] that including the valleys of [[Chipursan]] and [[Shingshal]], (Upper-Hunza—mostly intact), [[Ishkoman]] (many ethnic Wakhi speak, now, Shina), Yasin (many ethnic Wakhi of this valley speak, now, Khow-wor or Burushaski/Virchik-wor), [[Gupis]] (many ethnic Wakhi speak, now, Shina) and Yarkhun (many ethnic Wakhi of this valley now speak Khow-wor). Yarkhun is located in the [[Chitral]] district of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], while others are in the [[Gilgit–Baltistan]]. Gojal, in the Hunza valley, has the largest Wakhi population of any of the above five areas. The Wakhis of Ishkoman live primarily in the Karambar valley, in the town of Imit and beyond. In [[Yasin]], they live mostly in the vicinity of Darkot, and in Yarhkun, they are found in Baroghil and in a few other small villages in the high, upper portion of valley.

In Pakistan, the central organization of the Wakhi is the [[Wakhi Cultural Association]] Pakistan (WCA), an organization that is registered with the [[Government of Pakistan]] and which works with the collaboration of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and [[Lok Virsa Pakistan]]. The Association is working for the preservation of the Wakhi language and culture, as well as documenting their [[poetry]] and [[music]].

[[Radio Pakistan]] [[Gilgit]] relays the Wakhi radio programme "[[Sadoyah Boomy Dunyo]]", the voice of the roof of the world. The [[Wakhi Cultural Association]] has arranged more than twenty programmes since 1984, which includes cultural shows, musical nights, and large-scale musical festivals with the collaboration of Lok Virsa Pakistan, the [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture|Aga Khan Cultural Service Pakistan (AKCSP)]], and [[Pakistan Television Corporation|Pakistan television]]. In 2000, the WCA won a "Best Programme" organizer award in the [[Silk Road]] [[Festival]] from the [[President of Pakistan]], [[Pervez Musharraf]]. A computerized codification of the Wakhi script has been released, which will help to promote the language development programme and documentation of Wakhi poetry, literature, and [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wakhi Tajik Cultural Association report 1991–2001 |publisher=Wakhi Cultural Association |location=Pakistan |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In China===
{{see also|Tajiks of Xinjiang}}
Wakhi is also spoken in the [[Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County]], in Xinjiang of China.

===In Russia===
There are approximately 6,000 Wakhi in [[Russia]], Most of them have migrated from [[Tajikistan]] and [[Afghanistan]].

===In Turkey===
There are some Wakhi villages in [[Turkey]] in the eastern regions, where they have migrated from Afghanistan in 1979 during the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghan and Russian war]].&lt;ref&gt;See the book online{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} "The Kirghiz and Wakhi of Afghanistan in Turkey"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
Traditionally Wakhi was not a written language. Writing systems have been developed for the language using [[Arabic script|Arabic]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Latin script|Latin]] scripts.

===Arabic script===
This Arabic alphabet is mainly used in Afghanistan:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pamirian.ru/Wakhi_language_transition.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yaaku''' (also known as Mukogodo, Mogogodo, Mukoquodo, Siegu, Yaakua, Ndorobo) is an endangered [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language spoken in [[Kenya]]. It is [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]], but its position within that family is unclear. Speakers are all older adults.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

==Language situation==
The [[Yaaku people]] are former [[hunter-gatherer]]s and [[bee-keeping|bee-keepers]].  They adopted the [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] culture of the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] in the first half of the twentieth century, although some still keep bees. As a result, the Yaaku almost completely gave up their language for the [[Maasai language|Maa]] language of the dominant Maasai tribe (including the [[Samburu people|Samburu]]) between 1925 and 1936. The variety of Maa they speak is called ''Mukogodo-Maasai''. Old Yaaku words are still found in bee-keeping vocabulary, for example:
*{{IPA-xx|sɪka|}} &amp;mdash; 'honey' (cf. Maasai ''en-aisho o lotorrok'')
*{{IPA|[íno]}} &amp;mdash; '[[greater honeyguide]] (''Indicator indicator'')' (compare Maasai ''n-cɛshɔrɔ-î'')
*{{IPA|[kantála]}} &amp;mdash; 'wooden honey container (about 60&amp;nbsp;cm)'

A language-revival movement has started among the Yaaku in recent years, aiming to strengthen the Yaaku identity. In early 2005, Maarten Mous, Hans Stoks and Matthijs Blonk visited [[Doldol]] on the invitation of a special Yaaku committee, to determine whether there is enough knowledge of Yaaku left among the people to revive the language. This visit has shown there are few truly fluent Yaaku speakers left, all very old: two women called Roteti and Yaponay, respectively, and a man called Legunai. The latter two are both of the ''Terito'' [[age set]], which means that they must be around a hundred years old. Knowledge of vocabulary is much wider spread in the community. Full language revival is improbable because of the scarcity of fluent speakers, but one of the possibilities for a partial revival is to use Yaaku vocabulary in the framework of Maa grammar, a strategy that is analogous to the making of [[Mbugu language|Mbugu]], a mixed language of the Usambara mountains in [[Tanzania]].
