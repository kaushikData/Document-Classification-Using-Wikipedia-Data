      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11154">In [[model theory]], a discipline within [[mathematical logic]], an '''abstract elementary class''', or '''AEC''' for short, is a class of models  with a partial order similar to  the relation of an [[elementary substructure]] of an [[elementary class]] in [[first-order logic|first-order]] model theory. They were introduced by [[Saharon Shelah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shelah|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
&lt;math&gt;\langle K, \prec_K\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; a class of structures in some language &lt;math&gt;L = L(K)&lt;/math&gt;, is an AEC if it has the following properties:
* &lt;math&gt;\prec_K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partial order]] on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;M\prec_K N&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a substructure of &lt;math&gt; N&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Isomorphisms''': &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is closed under [[isomorphism]]s, and  if &lt;math&gt;M,N,M',N'\in K,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;f\colon M\simeq M',&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;g\colon N\simeq N',&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;f\subseteq g,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M\prec_K N,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;M'\prec_K N'.&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Coherence''': If &lt;math&gt;M_1\prec_K M_3,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;M_2\prec_K M_3,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_1\subseteq M_2,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;M_1\prec_K M_2.&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Tarski–Vaught [[Total order|chain]] axioms''': If &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an [[ordinal number|ordinal]] and &lt;math&gt;\{\,M_\alpha\mid \alpha&lt;\gamma\,\}\subseteq K&lt;/math&gt; is a chain (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\beta&lt;\gamma\implies M_\alpha\prec_K M_\beta&lt;/math&gt;), then:
**  &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\gamma} M_\alpha\in K&lt;/math&gt;
** If &lt;math&gt;M_\alpha\prec_K N&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\gamma} M_\alpha\prec_K N&lt;/math&gt;
* '''[[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem|Löwenheim–Skolem]] axiom''': There exists a [[cardinal number|cardinal]] &lt;math&gt;\mu \ge |L(K)| + \aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, such that if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the universe of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, then there is &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; whose universe contains &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\|N\|\leq |A|+\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N\prec_K M&lt;/math&gt;. We let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{LS}(K)&lt;/math&gt; denote the least such &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and call it the '''Löwenheim–Skolem number''' of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that we usually do not care about the models of size less than the Löwenheim–Skolem number and often assume that there are none (we will adopt this convention in this article). This is justified since we can always remove all such models from an AEC without influencing its structure above the Löwenheim–Skolem number.

A &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-embedding is a map &lt;math&gt;f: M \rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;M, N \in K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f[M] \prec_K N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;f[M]&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is clear from context, we omit it.

== Examples ==

The following are examples of abstract elementary classes:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|2002}}, Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

* An [[Elementary class]] is the most basic example of an AEC: If ''T'' is a first-order theory, then the class &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(T)&lt;/math&gt; of models of ''T'' together with [[elementary substructure]] forms an AEC with Löwenheim–Skolem number ''|T|''.
* If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a sentence in the [[infinitary logic]] &lt;math&gt;L_{\omega_1, \omega}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a countable [[fragment (logic)|fragment]] containing &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; \langle \operatorname{Mod}(T), \prec_{\mathcal{F}} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is an AEC with Löwenheim–Skolem number &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. This can be generalized to other logics, like &lt;math&gt;L_{\kappa, \omega}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;L_{\omega_1, \omega}(Q)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; expresses "there exists uncountably many".
* If ''T'' is a first-order countable [[superstable]] theory, the set of &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;-saturated models of ''T'', together with elementary substructure, is an AEC with Löwenheim–Skolem number &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Schanuel's conjecture#Zilber's pseudo-exponentiation|Zilber's pseudo-exponential fields]] form an AEC.

== Common assumptions ==

AECs are very general objects and one usually make some of the assumptions below when studying them:

* An AEC has ''joint embedding'' if any two model can be embedded inside a common model. 
* An AEC has ''no maximal model'' if any model has a proper extension.
* An AEC &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; has ''amalgamation'' if for any triple &lt;math&gt;M_0, M_1, M_2 \in K&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;M_0 \prec_K M_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_0 \prec_K M_2&lt;/math&gt;, there is &lt;math&gt;N \in K&lt;/math&gt; and embeddings of &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; inside &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; that fix &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; pointwise.

Note that in elementary classes, joint embedding holds whenever the theory is [[complete theory|complete]], while amalgamation and no maximal models are well-known consequences of the [[compactness theorem]]. These three assumptions allow us to build a universal model-homogeneous monster model &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{C}&lt;/math&gt;, exactly as in the elementary case.

Another assumption that one can make is [[Tame abstract elementary class|tameness]].

== Shelah's categoricity conjecture ==

Shelah introduced AECs to provide a uniform framework in which to generalize first-order [[Stable theory|classification theory]]. Classification theory started with [[Morley's categoricity theorem]], so it is natural to ask whether a similar result holds in AECs. This is '''Shelah's eventual categoricity conjecture'''. It states that there should be a Hanf number for categoricity:

For every AEC ''K'' there should be a cardinal &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; depending only on &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{LS}(K)&lt;/math&gt; such that if ''K'' is categorical in ''some'' &lt;math&gt;\lambda \geq \mu&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. ''K'' has exactly one (up to isomorphism) model of size &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;), then ''K'' is categorical in &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; for ''all'' &lt;math&gt;\theta \ge \mu&lt;/math&gt;.

Shelah also has several stronger conjectures: The threshold cardinal for categoricity is the Hanf number of psedo elemtary classes in a language of cardinality LS(K).  More specifically when the class is in a countable language and axiomaziable by an &lt;math&gt;L_{\omega_1,\omega}&lt;/math&gt; sentence the threshold number for categoricity is &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\omega_1}&lt;/math&gt;.  This conjecture dates back to 1976.

Several approximations have been published (see for example the results section below), assuming [[set theory|set-theoretic]] assumptions (such as the existence of [[large cardinals]] or variations of the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]]), or model-theoretic assumptions (such as amalgamation or tameness). As of 2014, the original conjecture remains open.

== Results ==
The following are some important results about AECs. Except for the last, all results are due to Shelah.

* '''Shelah's Presentation Theorem''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|2002}}, Theorem 3.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Any AEC &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PC}_{2^{\operatorname{LS}(K)}}&lt;/math&gt;: it is a reduct of a class of models of a first-order theory omitting at most &lt;math&gt;2^{\operatorname{LS}(K)}&lt;/math&gt; [[type (model theory)|types]].
* '''Hanf number for existence''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|2002}}, Corollary 3.5. Note that there is a typo there and that &lt;math&gt;2^{2^{\operatorname{LS}(K)}}&lt;/math&gt; should be replaced by &lt;math&gt;2^{\operatorname{LS}(K)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Any AEC &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; which has a model of size &lt;math&gt;\beth_{(2^{\operatorname{LS}(K)})^+}&lt;/math&gt; has models of arbitrarily large sizes.
* '''Amalgamation from categoricity''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|2002}}, Theorem 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt; If ''K'' is an AEC categorical in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2^\lambda &lt; 2^{\lambda^+}&lt;/math&gt;, then ''K'' has amalgamation for models of size &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
* '''Existence from categoricity''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossberg|2002}}, Theorem 5.1.&lt;/ref&gt; If ''K'' is a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PC}_{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; AEC with Löwenheim–Skolem number &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and ''K'' is categorical in &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, then ''K'' has a model of size &lt;math&gt;\aleph_2&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, no sentence of &lt;math&gt;L_{\omega_1, \omega}(Q)&lt;/math&gt; can have exactly one uncountable model.
* '''Approximations to Shelah's categoricity conjecture''': 
**'''Downward transfer from a successor''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shelah|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If ''K'' is an abstract elementary class with amalgamation that is categorical in a "high-enough" [[successor cardinal|successor]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, then ''K'' is categorical in all high-enough &lt;math&gt;\mu \le \lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
** '''Shelah's categoricity conjecture for a successor from large cardinals''':&lt;ref&gt;This is due to Will Boney, but combines results of many people, including Grossberg, Makkai, Shelah, and VanDieren. A proof appears in {{harvnb|Boney|2014}}, Theorem 7.5.&lt;/ref&gt; If there are class-many [[strongly compact cardinal]]s, then Shelah's categoricity conjecture holds when we start with categoricity at a successor.

'''Alistair Sinclair''' (born 1960) is a [[Great Britain|British]] computer scientist and [[computational theorist]].

Sinclair received his B.A. in Mathematics from [[St. John’s College, Cambridge]] in 1979, and his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1988 under the supervision of [[Mark Jerrum]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Sinclair, Alistair|date=1988|title=Randomised algorithms for counting and generating combinatorial structures|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1842/11392|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=Edinburgh Research Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;He is professor at the Computer Science division at [[UC Berkeley]] and has held faculty positions at University of Edinburgh and visiting positions at [[DIMACS]] and the [[International Computer Science Institute]] in Berkeley.

Sinclair’s research interests include the design and analysis of [[randomized algorithms]], computational applications of stochastic processes and nonlinear dynamical systems, [[Monte Carlo method]]s in [[Statistical Physics]],
and [[combinatorial optimization]]. With his advisor [[Mark Jerrum]], Sinclair investigated the mixing behaviour of [[Markov chain]]s to construct [[approximation algorithms]] for counting problems such as the [[computing the permanent]], with applications in diverse fields such as matching algorithms, geometric algorithms, mathematical programming, statistics, physics-inspired applications, and dynamical systems. This work has been highly influential in theoretical computer science and was recognised with the [[Gödel Prize]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigact.org/Prizes/Godel/1996.html 1996 Gödel Prize citation]&lt;/ref&gt; A refinement of these methods led to a fully polynomial time randomised approximation algorithm for computing the permanent, for which Sinclair and his co-authors received the [[Fulkerson Prize]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/200611/comm-fulkerson.pdf 2006 Fulkerson Prize citation], Notices of the AMS, December 2006, volume 53, number 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/08/fulkerson-prize.html "Fulkerson Prize"] ''Computational Complexity''.

[[File:Goldner-Harary graph.svg|thumb|The [[Goldner–Harary graph]], a non-Hamiltonian Apollonian network]]
In [[combinatorics|combinatorial mathematics]], an '''Apollonian network''' is an [[undirected graph]] formed by a process of recursively subdividing a triangle into three smaller triangles. Apollonian networks may equivalently be defined as the [[planar graph|planar]] [[k-tree|3-tree]]s, the maximal planar chordal graphs, the [[uniquely colorable graph|uniquely 4-colorable]] planar graphs, and the graphs of [[stacked polytope]]s. They are named after [[Apollonius of Perga]], who studied a related circle-packing construction.

==Definition==
An Apollonian network may be formed, starting from a single triangle [[graph embedding|embedded]] in the [[Euclidean plane]], by repeatedly selecting a triangular face of the embedding, adding a new vertex inside the face, and connecting the new vertex to each vertex of the face containing it. In this way, the triangle containing the new vertex is subdivided into three smaller triangles, which may in turn be subdivided in the same way.

==Examples==
The [[complete graph]]s on three and four vertices, {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, are both Apollonian networks. {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is formed by starting with a triangle and not performing any subdivisions, while {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} is formed by making a single subdivision before stopping.

The [[Goldner–Harary graph]] is an Apollonian network that forms the smallest [[Hamiltonian cycle|non-Hamiltonian]] maximal planar graph.&lt;ref&gt;This graph is named after the work of {{harvtxt|Goldner|Harary|1975}}; however, it appears earlier in the literature, for instance in {{harvtxt|Grünbaum|1967}}, p.&amp;nbsp;357.&lt;/ref&gt; Another more complicated Apollonian network was used by {{harvtxt|Nishizeki|1980}} to provide an example of a [[Graph toughness|1-tough]] non-Hamiltonian maximal planar graph.

==Graph-theoretic characterizations==
As well as being defined by recursive subdivision of triangles, the Apollonian networks have several other equivalent mathematical characterizations. They are the [[chordal graph|chordal]] maximal planar graphs, the chordal [[polyhedral graph]]s, and the planar [[k-tree|3-trees]]. They are the [[uniquely colorable graph|uniquely 4-colorable]] planar graphs, and the planar graphs with a unique [[Schnyder wood]] decomposition into three trees. They are the maximal planar graphs with treewidth three, a class of graphs that can be characterized by their [[forbidden graph characterization|forbidden minors]] or by their reducability under [[Y-Δ transform]]s. They are the maximal planar graphs with [[degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]] three. They are also the planar graphs on a given number of vertices that have the largest possible number of triangles, the largest possible number of tetrahedral subgraphs, the largest possible number of cliques, and the largest possible number of pieces after decomposing by separating triangles.

===Chordality===
Apollonian networks are examples of [[maximal element|maximal]] [[planar graph]]s, graphs to which no additional edges can be added without destroying planarity, or equivalently graphs that can be drawn in the plane so that every face (including the outer face) is a triangle. They are also [[chordal graph]]s, graphs in which every cycle of four or more vertices has a diagonal edge connecting two non-consecutive cycle vertices, and the order in which vertices are added in the subdivision process that forms an Apollonian network is an elimination ordering as a chordal graph. This forms an alternative characterization of the Apollonian networks: they are exactly the chordal maximal planar graphs or equivalently the chordal [[polyhedral graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The equivalence of planar 3-trees and chordal maximal planar graphs was stated without proof by {{harvtxt|Patil|1986}}. For a proof, see {{harvtxt|Markenzon|Justel|Paciornik|2006}}. For a more general characterization of chordal planar graphs, and an efficient recognition algorithm for these graphs, see {{harvtxt|Kumar|Madhavan|1989}}. The observation that every chordal polyhedral graph is maximal planar was stated explicitly by {{harvtxt|Gerlach|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an Apollonian network, every [[maximal clique]] is a complete graph on four vertices, formed by choosing any vertex and its three earlier neighbors. Every minimal [[clique-sum|clique separator]] (a clique that partitions the graph into two disconnected subgraphs) is one of the subdivided triangles. A chordal graph in which all maximal cliques and all minimal clique separators have the same size is a [[k-tree|{{math|''k''}}-tree]], and Apollonian networks are examples of 3-trees. Not every 3-tree is planar, but the planar 3-trees are exactly the Apollonian networks.

===Unique colorability===
Every Apollonian network is also a [[uniquely colorable graph|uniquely 4-colorable graph]]. Because it is a planar graph, the [[four color theorem]] implies that it has a [[graph coloring]] with only four colors, but once the three colors of the initial triangle are selected, there is only one possible choice for the color of each successive vertex, so up to permutation of the set of colors it has exactly one 4-coloring. It is more difficult to prove, but also true, that every uniquely 4-colorable planar graph is an Apollonian network. Therefore, Apollonian networks may also be characterized as the uniquely 4-colorable planar graphs.{{sfnp|Fowler|1998}} Apollonian networks also provide examples of planar graphs having as few {{math|''k''}}-colorings as possible for {{math|''k'' &gt; 4}}.&lt;ref&gt;The fact that Apollonian networks minimize the number of colorings with more than four of colors was shown in a dual form for colorings of maps by {{harvtxt|Birkhoff|1930}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apollonian networks are also exactly the maximal planar graphs that (once an exterior face is fixed) have a unique [[Schnyder wood]], a partition of the edges of the graph into three interleaved trees rooted at the three vertices of the exterior face.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Felsner|Zickfeld|2008}}; {{harvtxt|Bernardi|Bonichon|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treewidth===
The Apollonian networks do not form a family of graphs that is closed under the operation of taking [[graph minor]]s, as removing edges but not vertices from an Apollonian network produces a graph that is not an Apollonian network. However, the planar [[partial k-tree|partial 3-trees]], subgraphs of Apollonian networks, are minor-closed. Therefore, according to the [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]], they can be characterized by a finite number of [[forbidden graph characterization|forbidden minors]]. The minimal forbidden minors for the planar partial 3-trees are the four minimal graphs among the forbidden minors for the planar graphs and the partial 3-trees: the [[complete graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the [[complete bipartite graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the graph of the [[octahedron]], and the graph of the [[pentagonal prism]]. The Apollonian graphs are the maximal graphs that do not have any of these four graphs as a minor.&lt;ref&gt;The two forbidden minors for planar graphs are given by [[Wagner's theorem]]. For the forbidden minors for partial 3-trees (which include also the nonplanar [[Wagner graph]]) see {{harvtxt|Arnborg|Proskurowski|Corniel|1986}} and {{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1998}}. For direct proofs that the octahedral graph and the pentagonal-prism graph are the only two planar forbidden minors, see {{harvtxt|Dai|Sato|1990}} and {{harvtxt|El-Mallah|Colbourn|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Y-Δ transform]], an operation that replaces a degree-three vertex in a graph by a triangle connecting its neighbors, is sufficient (together with the removal of parallel edges) to reduce any Apollonian network to a single triangle, and more generally the planar graphs that can be reduced to a single edge by Y-Δ transforms, removal of parallel edges, removal of degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices are exactly the planar partial 3-trees. The dual graphs of the planar partial 3-trees form another minor-closed graph family and are exactly the planar graphs that can be reduced to a single edge by Δ-Y transforms, removal of parallel edges, removal of degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Politof|1983}} introduced the Δ-Y reducible planar graphs and characterized them in terms of forbidden homeomorphic subgraphs. The duality between the Δ-Y and Y-Δ reducible graphs, the forbidden minor characterizations of both classes, and the connection to planar partial 3-trees are all from {{harvtxt|El-Mallah|Colbourn|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degeneracy===
In every subgraph of an Apollonian network, the most recently added vertex has [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] at most three, so Apollonian networks have [[Degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]] three. The order in which the vertices are added to create the network is therefore a degeneracy ordering, and the Apollonian networks coincide with the 3-degenerate maximal planar graphs.

===Extremality===
Another characterization of the Apollonian networks involves their [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]]. Any maximal planar graph may be decomposed into 4-vertex-connected maximal planar subgraphs by splitting it along its separating triangles (triangles that are not faces of the graph): given any non-facial triangle: one can form two smaller maximal planar graphs, one consisting of the part inside the triangle and the other consisting of the part outside the triangle. The maximal planar graphs without separating triangles that may be formed by repeated splits of this type are sometimes called blocks, although that name has also been used for the [[biconnected component]]s of a graph that is not itself biconnected. An Apollonian network is a maximal planar graph in which all of the blocks are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the complete graph&amp;nbsp;{{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

In [[extremal graph theory]], Apollonian networks are also exactly the {{math|''n''}}-vertex planar graphs in which the number of blocks achieves its maximum, {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 3}}, and the planar graphs in which the number of triangles achieves its maximum, {{math|3''n'' &amp;minus; 8}}. Since each {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} subgraph of a planar graph must be a block, these are also the planar graphs in which the number of {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} subgraphs achieves its maximum, {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 3}}, and the graphs in which the number of [[clique (graph theory)|cliques]] of any type achieves its maximum, {{math|8''n'' &amp;minus; 16}}.&lt;ref&gt;For the characterization in terms of the maximum number of triangles in a planar graph, see {{harvtxt|Hakimi|Schmeichel|1979}}. {{harvtxt|Alon|Caro|1984}} quote this result and provide the characterizations in terms of the isomorphism classes of blocks and numbers of blocks. The bound on the total number of cliques follows easily from the bounds on triangles and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; subgraphs, and is also stated explicitly by {{harvtxt|Wood|2007}}, who provides an Apollonian network as an example showing that this bound is tight. For generalizations of these bounds to nonplanar surfaces, see {{harvtxt|Dujmović|Fijavž|Joret|Wood|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric realizations==

===Construction from circle packings===
[[File:Apollonian gasket.svg|thumb|An example of an Apollonian gasket]]
[[File:Circle packing theorem K5 minus edge example.svg|thumb|left|Construction of an Apollonian network from a circle packing]]
Apollonian networks are named after [[Apollonius of Perga]], who studied the [[Problem of Apollonius]] of constructing a circle tangent to three other circles. One method of constructing Apollonian networks is to start with three mutually-tangent circles and then repeatedly inscribe another circle within the gap formed by three previously-drawn circles. The fractal collection of circles produced in this way is called an [[Apollonian gasket]].

If the process of producing an Apollonian gasket is stopped early, with only a finite set of circles, then the graph that has one vertex for each circle and one edge for each pair of tangent circles is an Apollonian network.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrade|Herrmann|Andrade|da Silva|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of a set of tangent circles whose tangencies represent a given Apollonian network forms a simple instance of the [[Circle packing theorem|Koebe–Andreev–Thurston circle-packing theorem]], which states that any planar graph can be represented by tangent circles in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Thurston|1978–1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polyhedra===
[[File:Triakistetrahedron.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[triakis tetrahedron]], a polyhedral realization of an 8-vertex Apollonian network]]
Apollonian networks are planar [[vertex connectivity|3-connected graphs]] and therefore, by [[Steinitz's theorem]], can always be represented as the graphs of convex [[polyhedron|polyhedra]]. The convex polyhedron representing an Apollonian network is a 3-dimensional [[stacked polytope]]. Such a polytope can be obtained from a tetrahedron by repeatedly gluing additional tetrahedra one at a time onto its triangular faces. Therefore, Apollonian networks may also be defined as the graphs of stacked 3d polytopes.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{harvtxt|Below|De Loera|Richter-Gebert|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to find a representation of any Apollonian network as convex 3d polyhedron in which all of the coordinates are integers of polynomial size, better than what is known for other planar graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Demaine|Schulz|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triangle meshes===
The recursive subdivision of triangles into three smaller triangles was investigated as an [[Segmentation (image processing)|image segmentation]] technique in [[computer vision]] by {{harvtxt|Elcock|Gargantini|Walsh|1987}}; in this context, they called it the '''ternary scalene triangle decomposition'''. They observed that, by placing each new vertex at the [[centroid]] of its enclosing triangle, the triangulation could be chosen in such a way that all triangles have equal areas, although they do not all have the same shape. More generally,
Apollonian networks may be drawn in the plane with any prescribed area in each face; if the areas are [[rational number]]s, so are all of the vertex coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Biedl|Ruiz Velázquez|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to carry out the process of subdividing a triangle to form an Apollonian network in such a way that, at every step, the edge lengths are rational numbers; it is an open problem whether every planar graph has a drawing with this property.&lt;ref&gt;For subdividing a triangle with rational side lengths so that the smaller triangles also have rational side lengths, see {{harvtxt|Almering|1963}}. For progress on the general problem of finding planar drawings with rational edge lengths, see {{harvtxt|Geelen|Guo|McKinnon|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible in [[polynomial time]] to find a drawing of a planar 3-tree with integer coordinates minimizing the area of the [[bounding box]] of the drawing, and to test whether a given planar 3-tree may be drawn with its vertices on a given set of points.&lt;ref&gt;For the drawings with integer coordinates, see {{harvtxt|Mondal|Nishat|Rahman|Alam|2010}}, and for the drawings on a given vertex set, see {{harvtxt|Nishat|Mondal|Rahman|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and applications==

===Matching-free graphs===
{{harvtxt|Plummer|1992}} used Apollonian networks to construct an infinite family of maximal planar graphs with an even number of vertices but with no [[perfect matching]]. Plummer's graphs are formed in two stages. In the first stage, starting from a triangle {{math|''abc''}}, one repeatedly subdivides the triangular face of the subdivision that contains edge {{math|''bc''}}: the result is a graph consisting of a path from {{math|''a''}} to the final subdivision vertex together with an edge from each path vertex to each of {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}}. In the second stage, each of the triangular faces of the resulting planar graph is subdivided one more time. If the path from {{math|''a''}} to the final subdivision vertex of the first stage has even length, then the number of vertices in the overall graph is also even. However, approximately 2/3 of the vertices are the ones inserted in the second stage; these form an [[independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], and cannot be matched to each other, nor are there enough vertices outside the independent set to find matches for all of them.

Although Apollonian networks themselves may not have perfect matchings, the [[planar dual]] graphs of Apollonian networks are [[cubic graph|3-regular graphs]] with no [[Bridge (graph theory)|cut edges]], so by a theorem of {{harvtxt|Petersen|1891}} they are guaranteed to have at least one perfect matching. However, in this case more is known: the duals of Apollonian networks always have an exponential number of perfect matchings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jiménez|Kiwi|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[László Lovász]] and [[Michael D. Plummer]] conjectured that a similar exponential lower bound holds more generally for every 3-regular graph without cut edges, a result that was later proven.

===Power law graphs===
{{harvtxt|Andrade|Herrmann|Andrade|da Silva|2005}} studied [[power law]]s in the [[degree (graph theory)|degree sequences]] of a special case of networks of this type, formed by subdividing all triangles the same number of times. They used these networks to model packings of space by particles of varying sizes. Based on their work, other authors introduced random Apollonian networks, formed by repeatedly choosing a random face to subdivide, and they showed that these also obey power laws in their degree distribution &lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Tsourakakis|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and have small average distances.&lt;ref name="ran"&gt;{{harvtxt|Zhou|Yan|Zhou|Fu|2004}}; {{harvtxt|Zhou|Yan|Wang|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan M. Frieze]] and Charalampos E. Tsourakakis analyzed the highest degrees and the eigenvalues of random Apollonian networks .&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Frieze|Tsourakakis|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrade et al. also observed that their networks satisfy the [[small world effect]], that all vertices are within a small distance of each other. Based on numerical evidence they estimated the average distance between randomly selected pairs of vertices in an {{math|''n''}}-vertex network of this type to be proportional to {{math|(log ''n'')&lt;sup&gt;3/4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, but later researchers showed that the average distance is actually proportional to {{math|log ''n''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Albenque|Marckert|2008}};{{harvtxt|Zhang|Chen|Zhou|Fang|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Angle distribution===
{{harvtxt|Butler|Graham|2010}} observed that if each new vertex is placed at the [[incenter]] of its triangle, so that the edges to the new vertex [[Bisection#Angle bisector|bisect the angles]] of the triangle, then the set of triples of angles of triangles in the subdivision, when reinterpreted as triples of [[barycentric coordinate system (mathematics)|barycentric coordinate]]s of points in an [[equilateral triangle]], converges in shape to the [[Sierpinski triangle]] as the number of levels of subdivision grows.

===Hamiltonicity===
{{harvtxt|Takeo|1960}} claimed erroneously that all Apollonian networks have [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s; however, the [[Goldner–Harary graph]] provides a counterexample. If an Apollonian network has [[graph toughness|toughness]] greater than one (meaning that removing any set of vertices from the graph leaves a smaller number of connected components than the number of removed vertices) then it necessarily has a Hamiltonian cycle, but there exist non-Hamiltonian Apollonian networks whose toughness is equal to one.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Nishizeki|1980}} for a 1-tough non-Hamiltonian example, {{harvtxt|Böhme|Harant|Tkáč|1999}} for the proof that Apollonian networks with greater toughness are Hamiltonian, and {{harvtxt|Gerlach|2004}} for an extension of this result to a wider class of planar graphs.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enumeration===
The [[combinatorial enumeration]] problem of counting Apollonian triangulations was studied by {{harvtxt|Takeo|1960}}, who showed that they have the simple [[generating function]] {{math|''f''(''x'')}} described by the equation {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 1 + ''x''(''f''(''x''))&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
In this generating function, the term of degree {{mvar|n}} counts the number of Apollonian networks with a fixed outer triangle and {{math|''n'' + 3}} vertices.
Thus, the numbers of Apollonian networks (with a fixed outer triangle) on 3, 4, 5, ... vertices are:
:1, 1, 3, 12, 55, 273, 1428, 7752, 43263, 246675, ... {{OEIS|A001764}},
a sequence that also counts [[ternary tree]]s and dissections of convex polygons into odd-sided polygons.
For instance, there are 12 6-vertex Apollonian networks: three formed by subdividing the outer triangle once and then subdividing two of the resulting triangles,
and nine formed by subdividing the outer triangle once, subdividing one of its triangles, and then subdividing one of the resulting smaller triangles.

==History==
{{harvtxt|Birkhoff|1930}} is an early paper that uses a dual form of Apollonian networks, the planar maps formed by repeatedly placing new regions at the vertices of simpler maps,  as a class of examples of planar maps with few colorings.

Geometric structures closely related to Apollonian networks have been studied in [[polyhedral combinatorics]] since at least the early 1960s, when they were used by {{harvtxt|Grünbaum|1963}} to describe graphs that can be realized as the graph of a polytope in only one way, without dimensional or combinatorial ambiguities, and by {{harvtxt|Moon|Moser|1963}} to find [[simplicial polytope]]s with no long paths. In [[graph theory]], the close connection between planarity and treewidth goes back to {{harvtxt|Robertson|Seymour|1984}}, who showed that every minor-closed family of graphs either has bounded treewidth or contains all of the planar graphs. Planar 3-trees, as a class of graphs, were explicitly considered by {{harvtxt|Hakimi|Schmeichel|1979}}, {{harvtxt|Alon|Caro|1984}}, {{harvtxt|Patil|1986}}, and many authors since them.

The name "Apollonian network" was given by {{harvtxt|Andrade|Herrmann|Andrade|da Silva|2005}} to the networks they studied in which the level of subdivision of triangles is uniform across the network; these networks correspond geometrically to a type of stacked polyhedron called a [[Kleetope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|1963}}; {{harvtxt|Grünbaum|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors applied the same name more broadly to planar 3-trees in their work generalizing the model of Andrade et al. to random Apollonian networks.&lt;ref name="ran"/&gt; The triangulations generated in this way have also been named "stacked triangulations"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Alon|Caro|1984}}; {{harvtxt|Zickfeld|Ziegler|2006}}; {{harvtxt|Badent|Binucci|Di Giacomo|Didimo|2007}}; {{harvtxt|Felsner|Zickfeld|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or "stack-triangulations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Albenque|Marckert|2008}}; {{harvtxt|Bernardi|Bonichon|2009}}; {{harvtxt|Jiménez|Kiwi|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum chromodynamics]] (and also ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 [[Super QCD|superquantum chromodynamics]]) with massless [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavors]], if the number of flavors, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;, is sufficiently small (i.e. small enough to guarantee [[asymptotic freedom]], depending on the number of [[color charge|colors]]), the theory can flow to an interacting conformal [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the [[renormalization group]]. If the value of the coupling at that point is less than one (''i.e.'' one can perform [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] in weak coupling), then the fixed point is called a '''Banks–Zaks fixed point'''.  The existence of the fixed point was first reported by William E. Caswell in 1974, and later used by Banks and Zaks in their analysis of the phase structure of vector-like gauge theories with massless fermions. For this reason one also justifiably finds references to  a '''Caswell-Banks–Zaks fixed point'''.

More specifically, suppose that we find that the beta function of a theory up to two loops has the form

: &lt;math&gt;\beta(g) = -b_0 g^3 + b_1 g^5 + \mathcal{O}(g^7) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;b_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; are positive constants. Then there exists a value &lt;math&gt;g=g_\ast&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\beta(g_\ast) =0&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;g_\ast^2 = \frac{b_0}{b_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

If we can arrange &lt;math&gt;b_0&lt;/math&gt; to be smaller than &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt;, then we have &lt;math&gt;g^2_\ast &lt;1&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that when the theory flows to the IR it is a conformal, weakly coupled theory with coupling &lt;math&gt;g_\ast&lt;/math&gt;.

For the case of a [[Yang-Mills Theory|non-Abelian gauge theory]] with gauge group [[special unitary group|&lt;math&gt;SU(N_c)&lt;/math&gt;]] and [[Dirac fermion]]s in the fundamental representation of the gauge group for the flavored particles we have 

:&lt;math&gt;b_0 = \frac{1}{16\pi^2}\frac{1}{3}(11N_c-2N_f) \;\;\;\; \text{      and       }\;\;\;\; b_1 = -\frac{1}{(16\pi^2)^2}\left(\frac{34}{3}N_c^2 - \frac{1}{2}N_f\left(2 \frac{N_c^2 -1}{N_c} + \frac{20}{3}N_c \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_c&lt;/math&gt; is the number of colors and &lt;math&gt;N_f&lt;/math&gt; the number of flavors. Then &lt;math&gt;N_f&lt;/math&gt; should lie just below &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{11}{2}N_c&lt;/math&gt; in order for the Banks–Zaks fixed point to appear. Note that this fixed point only occurs if, in addition to the previous requirement on &lt;math&gt;N_f&lt;/math&gt; (which guarantees asymptotic freedom), 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{11}{2}N_c&gt;N_f&gt;\frac{34N_c^3}{(13N_c^2-3)}&lt;/math&gt; 
where the lower bound comes from requiring &lt;math&gt;b_1&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. This way &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; remains positive while &lt;math&gt;-b_0&lt;/math&gt; is still negative (see first equation in article) and one can solve &lt;math&gt;\beta (g) = 0&lt;/math&gt; with real solutions for &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], a '''bifundamental''' representation is a [[representation theory|representation]] obtained as a [[tensor product]] of two [[fundamental representation | fundamental]] or [[antifundamental representation | antifundamental]] representations.

For example, the ''MN''-dimensional representation (''M'',''N'') of the group 
:&lt;math&gt;SU(M) \times SU(N)&lt;/math&gt; 

is a bifundamental representation. 

These representations occur in [[quiver diagram]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13391">In [[graph theory]], a '''bipolar orientation''' or '''''st''-orientation''' of an [[undirected graph]] is an assignment of a direction to each edge (an [[Orientation (graph theory)|orientation]]) that causes the graph to become a [[directed acyclic graph]] with a single source ''s'' and a single sink ''t'', and an '''''st''-numbering''' of the graph is a [[topological ordering]] of the resulting directed acyclic graph.&lt;ref name="rt86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmt95"/&gt;

==Definitions and existence==
Let ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',''E'') be an undirected graph with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''V''| vertices. An [[Orientation (graph theory)|orientation]] of ''G'' is an assignment of a direction to each edge of ''G'', making it into a [[directed graph]]. It is an [[acyclic orientation]] if the resulting directed graph has no [[directed cycle]]s. Every acyclically oriented graph has at least one ''source'' (a vertex with no incoming edges) and at least one ''sink'' (a vertex with no outgoing edges); it is a bipolar orientation if it has exactly one source and exactly one sink. In some situations, ''G'' may be given together with two designated vertices ''s'' and ''t''; in this case, a bipolar orientation for ''s'' and ''t'' must have ''s'' as its unique source and ''t'' as its unique sink.&lt;ref name="rt86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmt95"/&gt;

An ''st''-numbering of ''G'' (again, with two designated vertices ''s'' and ''t'') is an assignment of the integers from 1 to ''n'' to the vertices of ''G'', such that
*each vertex is assigned a distinct number,
*''s'' is assigned the number 1,
*''t'' is assigned the number ''n'', and
*if a vertex ''v'' is assigned the number ''i'' with 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n'', then at least one neighbor of ''v'' is assigned a smaller number than ''i'' and at least one neighbor of ''v'' is assigned a larger number than ''i''.&lt;ref name="rt86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmt95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lec66"/&gt;

A graph has a bipolar orientation if and only if it has an ''st''-numbering. For, if it has a bipolar orientation, then an ''st''-numbering may be constructed by finding a [[topological ordering]] of the directed acyclic graph given by the orientation, and numbering each vertex by its position in the ordering. In the other direction, every ''st''-numbering gives rise to a topological ordering, in which each edge of ''G'' is oriented from its lower-numbered endpoint to its higher-numbered endpoint.&lt;ref name="rt86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmt95"/&gt; In a graph containing edge ''st'', an orientation is bipolar if and only if it is acyclic and the orientation formed by reversing edge ''st'' is [[Strong orientation|totally cyclic]].&lt;ref name="fmt95"/&gt;

A connected graph ''G'', with designated vertices ''s'' and ''t'', has a bipolar orientation and an ''st''-numbering if and only if the graph formed from ''G'' by adding an edge from ''s'' to ''t'' is [[Biconnected graph|2-vertex-connected]].&lt;ref name="lec66"/&gt; In one direction, if this graph is 2-vertex-connected, then a bipolar orientation may be obtained by consistently orienting each ear in an [[ear decomposition]] of the graph.&lt;ref name="msv86"/&gt; In the other direction, if the graph is not 2-vertex-connected, then it has an articulation vertex ''v'' separating some biconnected component of ''G'' from ''s'' and ''t''. If this component contains a vertex with a lower number than ''v'', then the lowest-numbered vertex in the component cannot have a lower-numbered neighbor, and symmetrically if it contains a vertex with a higher number than ''v'' then the highest-numbered vertex in the component cannot have a higher-numbered neighbor.

==Applications to planarity==
{{harvtxt|Lempel|Even|Cederbaum|1967}} formulated ''st''-numberings as part of a [[planarity testing]] [[algorithm]],&lt;ref name="lec66"/&gt; and {{harvtxt|Rosenstiehl|Tarjan|1986}} formulated bipolar orientations as part of an algorithm for constructing [[tessellation representation]]s of [[planar graph]]s.&lt;ref name="rt86"/&gt;

A bipolar orientation of a planar graph results in an [[st-planar graph|''st''-planar graph]], a directed acyclic planar graph with one source and one sink. These graphs are of some importance in [[Lattice (order)|lattice theory]] as well as in [[graph drawing]]: the [[Hasse diagram]] of a [[order dimension|two-dimensional]] lattice is necessarily ''st''-planar, and every [[transitive reduction|transitively reduced]] ''st''-planar graph represents a two-dimensional lattice in this way.&lt;ref name="platt76"/&gt; A directed acyclic graph ''G'' has an [[upward planar drawing]] if and only if ''G'' is a subgraph of an ''st''-planar graph.&lt;ref name="dbt88"/&gt;

==Algorithms==
It is possible to find an ''st''-numbering, and a bipolar orientation, of a given graph with designated vertices ''s'' and ''t'', in [[linear time]] using [[depth-first search]].&lt;ref name="ebert83"/&gt;&lt;ref name="et76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="t86"/&gt; The algorithm of {{harvtxt|Tarjan|1986}} uses a depth-first search that starts at vertex ''s'' and first traverses edge ''st''. As in the depth-first-search based algorithm for testing whether a graph is biconnected, this algorithm defines pre(''v''), for a vertex ''v'', to be the [[preorder]] number of ''v'' in the depth-first traversal, and low(''v'') to be the smallest preorder number that can be reached by following a single edge from a descendant of ''v'' in the depth-first search tree. Both of these numbers may be computed in [[linear time]] as part of the depth-first search. The given graph will be biconnected (and will have a bipolar orientation) if and only if ''t'' is the only child of ''s'' in the depth-first search tree and low(''v'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;pre(''v'') for all vertices ''v'' other than&amp;nbsp;''s''. Once these numbers have been computed, Tarjan's algorithm performs a second traversal of the depth-first search tree, maintaining a number sign(''v'') for each vertex ''v'' and a [[linked list]] of vertices that will eventually list all vertices of the graph in the order given by an ''st''-numbering. Initially, the list contains ''s'' and ''t'', and sign(''s'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1. When each vertex ''v'' is first encountered by this second traversal, ''v'' is inserted into the list, either before or after its parent p(''v'') in the depth-first search tree according to whether sign(low(''v'')) is negative or positive respectively; then sign(p(''v'')) is set to &amp;minus;sign(low(''v'')). As Tarjan shows, the vertex ordering resulting from this procedure gives an ''st''-numbering of the given graph.&lt;ref name="t86"/&gt;

Alternatively, efficient sequential and parallel algorithms may be based on [[ear decomposition]].&lt;ref name="msv86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="g91"/&gt; An open ear decomposition of a given graph, with designated vertices ''s'' and ''t'', may be defined as a partition of the edges of the graph into a sequence of paths called "ears", in which the endpoints of the first ear are ''s'' and ''t'', the endpoints of each subsequent ear appear in previous ears in the sequence, and each vertex in the interior of one of the ears appears for the first time in that ear. An open ear decomposition exists if and only if the graph formed from the given graph by adding an edge ''st'' is biconnected (the same condition as the existence of a bipolar orientation), and it can be found in linear time. An ''st''-orientation may be obtained by directing each ear in a consistent direction, taking care that if there already exists a directed path connecting the same two endpoints among the edges of previous ears then the new ear must be oriented in the same direction. However, testing this directly by a [[reachability]] computation would be slow. {{harvtxt|Maon|Schieber|Vishkin|1986}} provide a complicated but localized search procedure for determining an appropriate orientation for each ear that (unlike the approach using depth-first search) is suitable for parallel computation.&lt;ref name="msv86"/&gt;

{{harvtxt|Papamanthou|Tollis|2006}} report on algorithms for controlling the lengths of the directed paths in a bipolar orientation of a given graph, which in turn leads to some control over the width and height of certain types of [[graph drawing]].&lt;ref name="pt05"/&gt;

==The space of all orientations==
For 3-vertex-connected graphs, with designated vertices ''s'' and ''t'', any two bipolar orientations may be connected to each other by a sequence of operations that reverse one edge at a time, at each step maintaining a bipolar orientation.&lt;ref name="fmt95"/&gt; More strongly, for [[polyhedral graph|planar 3-connected graph]]s, the set of bipolar orientations can be given the structure of a [[finite distributive lattice]], with the edge-reversal operation corresponding to the [[covering relation]] of the lattice.&lt;ref name="fmt95"/&gt; For any graph with designated source and sink, the set of all bipolar orientations may be listed in polynomial time per orientation.&lt;ref name="fmt95"/&gt;

'''Box counting''' is a method of gathering [[#data|data]] for analyzing [[complex systems|complex patterns]] by breaking a [[Data set|dataset]], object, image, etc. into smaller and smaller pieces, typically "box"-shaped, and analyzing the pieces at each smaller scale. The essence of the process has been compared to zooming in or out using optical or computer based methods to examine how observations of detail change with scale. In box counting, however, rather than changing the magnification or resolution of a lens, the investigator changes the [[#boxsize|size of the element]] used to inspect the object or pattern (see [[#32seg|Figure 1]]). Computer based box counting algorithms have been applied to patterns in 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Jing Z. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Lu D. | last3 = Yue | first3 = Guang H. | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(03)74817-6 | title = Fractal Dimension in Human Cerebellum Measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 85 | issue = 6 | pages = 4041–4046 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14645092 | pmc = 1303704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = T.

The technique arose out of and is used in [[fractal analysis]]. It also has application in related fields such as [[lacunarity]] and [[multifractal]] analysis.&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot|year=1983|title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature |isbn=978-0-7167-1186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fil"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fractal Geometry in Biological Systems|author=Iannaccone, Khokha| isbn=978-0-8493-7636-8|pages=143|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The method ==
Theoretically, the intent of box counting is to quantify [[fractal]] scaling, but from a practical perspective this would require that the scaling be known ahead of time. This can be seen in [[#32seg|Figure 1]] where choosing boxes of the right relative sizes readily shows how the pattern repeats itself at smaller scales. In fractal analysis, however, the scaling factor is not always known ahead of time, so box counting algorithms attempt to find an optimized way of cutting a pattern up that will reveal the scaling factor. The fundamental method for doing this starts with a [[#box size|set of measuring elements]]—''boxes''—consisting of an arbitrary number, called &lt;math&gt;\Epsilon&lt;/math&gt; here for convenience, of sizes or calibres, which we will call the set of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;s. Then these &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-sized boxes are applied to the pattern and counted. To do this, for each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, a measuring element that is typically a 2-dimensional square or 3-dimensional box with side length corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is used to scan a pattern or data set (e.g., an image or object) according to a predetermined [[#scan|scanning plan]] to cover the relevant part of the data set, recording, i.e.,''counting'', for each step in the scan [[#data|relevant features]] captured within the measuring element.&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "fil"/&gt;

{{anchor|data}}

=== The data ===
The relevant features gathered during box counting depend on the subject being investigated and the type of analysis being done. Two well-studied subjects of box counting, for instance, are binary (meaning having only two colours, usually black and white)&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; and gray-scale&lt;ref name="gray"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = J. | last2 = Du | first2 = Q. | last3 = Sun | first3 = C. | doi = 10.1016/j.patcog.2009.03.001 | title = An improved box-counting method for image fractal dimension estimation | journal = Pattern Recognition | volume = 42 | issue = 11 | pages = 2460–2469 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital image]]s (i.e., jpgs, tiffs, etc.). Box counting is generally done on patterns [[#extracting patterns|extracted]] from such still images in which case the raw information recorded is typically based on features of pixels such as a predetermined colour value or range of colours or intensities. When box counting is done to determine a [[fractal dimension]] known as the [[box counting dimension]], the information recorded is usually either yes or no as to whether or not the box contained any pixels of the predetermined colour or range (i.e., the number of boxes containing relevant pixels at each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is counted). For other types of analysis, the data sought may be the number of pixels that fall within the measuring box,&lt;ref name="fil"/&gt; the range or average values of colours or intensities, the spatial arrangement amongst pixels within each box, or properties such as average speed (e.g., from particle flow).&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Scan types ===
{{anchor|scan}}Every box counting algorithm has a scanning plan that describes how the data will be gathered, in essence, how the box will be moved over the space containing the pattern. A variety of scanning strategies has been used in box counting algorithms, where a few basic approaches have been modified in order to address issues such as sampling, analysis methods, etc.

{{Anchor|scanimages}}[[Image:Fixedstack.gif|thumb|left|400px|Figure 2a. Boxes laid over an image as a fixed grid.

The difference is attributable to the position of the grid, illustrating the importance of grid placement in box counting.]]

====Fixed grid scans====
The traditional approach is to scan in a non-overlapping regular grid or lattice pattern.&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fil"/&gt; To illustrate, [[#scanimages|Figure 2]]a shows the typical pattern used in software that calculates box counting dimensions from patterns extracted into binary digital images of contours such as the fractal contour illustrated in [[#32seg|Figure 1]] or the classic example of the coastline of Britain often used to explain the method of finding a [[box counting dimension]]. The strategy simulates repeatedly laying a square box as though it were part of a grid overlaid on the image, such that the box for each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; never overlaps where it has previously been (see [[#grids|Figure 4]]). This is done until the entire area of interest has been scanned using each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and the [[#section The Data|relevant information]] has been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Popescu | first1 = D.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = R. D. | last2 = George | first2 = A. T. | last3 = Jeon | first3 = T. | last4 = Hynan | first4 = L. S. | last5 = Youn | first5 = T.

==== Sliding box scans ====
Another approach that has been used is a sliding box algorithm, in which each box is slid over the image overlapping the previous placement. [[#scanimages|Figure 2]]b illustrates the basic pattern of scanning using a sliding box. The fixed grid approach can be seen as a sliding box algorithm with the increments horizontally and vertically equal to &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Sliding box algorithms are often used for analyzing textures in [[lacunarity]] analysis and have also been applied to [[multifractal analysis]]&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mf"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cheng | first1 = Qiuming | authorlink = Qiuming Cheng| title = Multifractal Modeling and Lacunarity Analysis | journal = Mathematical Geology | volume = 29 | issue = 7 | pages = 919–932 | doi = 10.1023/A:1022355723781 | year = 1997 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Subsampling and local dimensions ====
Box counting may also be used to determine local variation as opposed to global measures describing an entire pattern. Local variation can be assessed after the data have been gathered and analyzed (e.g., some software colour codes areas according to the fractal dimension for each subsample), but a third approach to box counting is to move the box according to some feature related to the pixels of interest.  In [[local connected dimension]] box counting algorithms, for instance, the box for each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is centred on each pixel of interest, as illustrated in [[#scanimages|Figure 2]]c.&lt;ref name="landini"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodological considerations ==
The implementation of any box counting algorithm has to specify certain details such as how to determine the actual values in &lt;math&gt;\Epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, including the minimum and maximum sizes to use and the method of incrementing between sizes. Many such details reflect practical matters such as the size of a digital image but also technical issues related to the specific analysis that will be performed on the data. {{anchor| optimal covering}}Another issue that has received considerable attention is how to approximate the so-called "optimal covering" for determining [[box counting dimension]]s and assessing [[multifractal analysis|multifractal scaling]].&lt;ref name="gray"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gorski | first1 = A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Edge effects ===
One known issue in this respect is deciding what constitutes the edge of the useful information in a digital image, as the limits employed in the box counting strategy can affect the data gathered.

=== Scaling box size ===
The algorithm has to specify the type of increment to use between box sizes (e.g., linear vs exponential), which can have a profound effect on the results of a scan.

=== Grid orientation ===
As [[#grids|Figure 4]] illustrates, the overall positioning of the boxes also influences the results of a box count. One approach in this respect is to scan from multiple orientations and use averaged or optimized data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karperien|title=Defining Microglial Morphology: Form, Function, and Fractal Dimension|year=2004| publisher=Charles Sturt University, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schulze | first1 = M.

To address various methodological considerations, some software is written so users can specify many such details, and some includes methods such as smoothing the data after the fact to be more amenable to the type of analysis being done.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Karperien| title=Box Counting| year=2002| url=http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/fraclac/FLHelp/BoxCounting.htm#sampling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Soap film]] attached to twin circular rings will take the shape of a catenoid.&lt;ref name=Gullberg/&gt; Because they are members of the same [[associate family]] of surfaces, a catenoid can be bent into a portion of a [[helicoid]], and vice versa.

==Geometry==
The catenoid was the first non-trivial minimal [[surface (topology)|surface]] in 3-dimensional Euclidean space to be discovered apart from the [[plane (geometry)|plane]]. The catenoid is obtained by rotating a catenary about its [[Directrix (conic section)|directrix]].&lt;ref name=Gullberg/&gt; It was found and proved to be minimal by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helveticae|first1=Euler, Leonhard |editor= Carathëodory Constantin |title=Methodus inveniendi lineas curvas: maximi minimive proprietate gaudentes sive solutio problematis isoperimetrici latissimo sensu accepti |date=1952 |orig-year=reprint of 1744 edition |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media  |isbn=3-76431-424-9 |language=Latin |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Methodus_inveniendi_lineas_curvas_maximi.html?id=zNDdVFZalSAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Colding06&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colding|first1=T.

The catenoid may be defined by the following parametric equations:

:&lt;math&gt;x=c \cosh \frac{v}{c} \cos u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=c \cosh \frac{v}{c} \sin u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z=v&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;u \in [-\pi, \pi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a non-zero real constant.

In cylindrical coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho =c \cosh \frac{z}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a real constant.

A physical model of a catenoid can be formed by dipping two [[circle|circular]] rings into a soap solution and slowly drawing the circles apart.

The catenoid may be also defined approximately by the [[Stretched grid method]] as a facet 3D model.

== Helicoid transformation ==

[[Image:helicatenoid.gif|thumb|right|256px|alt=Continuous animation showing a helicoid deforming into a catenoid and back to a helicoid|Deformation of a [[helicoid]] into a catenoid]]

Because they are members of the same [[associate family]] of surfaces, one can bend a catenoid into a portion of a [[helicoid]] without stretching.  In other words, one can make a (mostly) [[continuous function|continuous]] and [[Isometry|isometric]] deformation of a catenoid to a portion of the [[helicoid]] such that every member of the deformation family is [[Minimal surface|minimal]] (having a [[mean curvature]] of zero).  A [[Parametric equation|parametrization]] of such a deformation is given by the system

:&lt;math&gt;x(u,v) = \cos \theta \,\sinh v \,\sin u + \sin \theta \,\cosh v \,\cos u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y(u,v) = -\cos \theta \,\sinh v \,\cos u + \sin \theta \,\cosh v \,\sin u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z(u,v) = u \cos \theta + v \sin \theta &lt;/math&gt;

:for &lt;math&gt;(u,v) \in (-\pi, \pi] \times (-\infty, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;, with deformation parameter &lt;math&gt;-\pi &lt; \theta \le \pi&lt;/math&gt;,

where 
&lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a right-handed helicoid, 
&lt;math&gt;\theta = \pm \pi / 2&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a catenoid, and
&lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a left-handed helicoid.

In [[programming language theory]] and [[proof theory]], the '''Curry–Howard correspondence''' (also known as the '''Curry–Howard isomorphism''' or '''equivalence''', or the '''proofs-as-programs''' and '''propositions-''' or '''formulae-as-types interpretation''') is the direct relationship between [[computer program]]s and [[mathematical proof]]s. 

It is a generalization of a syntactic [[analogy]] between systems of formal logic and computational calculi that was first discovered by the American [[mathematician]] [[Haskell Curry]] and [[logician]] [[William Alvin Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;The correspondence was first made explicit in {{harvnb|Howard |1980}}. See, for example section 4.6, p.53 [http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/courses/sem-ws07/notes/0.pdf Gert Smolka and Jan Schwinghammer (2007-8), Lecture Notes in Semantics]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the link between logic and computation that is usually attributed to Curry and Howard, although the idea is related to the operational interpretation of [[intuitionistic logic]] given in various formulations by  [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], [[Arend Heyting]] and [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] (see [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]])&lt;ref&gt;The Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation  is also called the 'proof interpretation': p. 161 of Juliette Kennedy, Roman Kossak, eds. 2011.

The relationship has been extended to include [[category theory]] as the three-way '''Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence'''.

The beginnings of the '''Curry–Howard correspondence''' lie in several observations:
# In 1934 [[Haskell Curry|Curry]] observes that the [[typed lambda calculus|type]]s of the combinators could be seen as [[axiom-scheme]]s for [[intuitionism|intuitionistic]] implicational logic.{{sfn|Curry|1934}}
# In 1958 he observes that a certain kind of [[proof calculus|proof system]], referred to as [[Hilbert-style deduction system]]s, coincides on some fragment to the typed fragment of a standard [[model of computation]] known as [[combinatory logic]].{{sfn|Curry|Feys|1958}}
# In 1969 [[William Alvin Howard|Howard]] observes that another, more "high-level" [[proof calculus|proof system]], referred to as [[natural deduction]], can be directly interpreted in its [[intuitionistic]] version as a typed variant of the [[model of computation]] known as [[lambda calculus]].{{sfn|Howard|1980}}

In other words, the Curry–Howard correspondence is the observation that two families of seemingly unrelated formalisms—namely, the proof systems on one hand, and the models of computation on the other—are in fact the same kind of mathematical objects.

If one abstracts on the peculiarities of either formalism, the following generalization arises: ''a proof is a program, and the formula it proves is the type for the program''.  More informally, this can be seen as an [[analogy]] that states that the [[return type]] of a function (i.e., the type of values returned by a function) is analogous to a logical theorem, subject to hypotheses corresponding to the types of the argument values passed to the function; and that the program to compute that function is analogous to a proof of that theorem.  This sets a form of [[logic programming]] on a rigorous foundation: ''proofs can be represented as programs, and especially as lambda terms'', or ''proofs can be '''run'''''.

The correspondence has been the starting point of a large spectrum of new research after its discovery, leading in particular to a new class of [[formal system]]s designed to act both as a [[proof calculus|proof system]] and as a typed [[functional programming language]]. This includes [[Martin-Löf]]'s [[intuitionistic type theory]] and [[Thierry Coquand|Coquand]]'s [[Calculus of Constructions]], two calculi in which proofs are regular objects of the discourse and in which one can state properties of proofs the same way as of any program. This field of research is usually referred to as modern [[type theory]].

Such [[typed lambda calculus|typed lambda calculi]] derived from the Curry–Howard paradigm led to software like [[Coq]] in which proofs seen as programs can be formalized, checked, and run.

A converse direction is to ''use a program to extract a proof'', given its [[program correctness|correctness]]—an area of research closely related to [[proof-carrying code]].  This is only feasible if the [[programming language]] the program is written for is very richly typed:  the development of such type systems has been partly motivated by the wish to make the Curry–Howard correspondence practically relevant.

The Curry–Howard correspondence also raised new questions regarding the computational content of proof concepts that were not covered by the original works of Curry and Howard. In particular, [[classical logic]] has been shown to correspond to the ability to manipulate the [[continuation]] of programs and the symmetry of [[sequent calculus]] to express the duality between the two [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]] known as call-by-name and call-by-value.

Speculatively, the Curry–Howard correspondence might be expected to lead to a substantial [[unifying theories in mathematics|unification]] between mathematical logic and foundational computer science:

Hilbert-style logic and natural deduction are but two kinds of proof systems among a large family of formalisms. Alternative syntaxes include [[sequent calculus]], [[proof net]]s, [[calculus of structures]], etc. If one admits the Curry–Howard correspondence as the general principle that any proof system hides a model of computation, a theory of the underlying untyped computational structure of these kinds of proof system should be possible. Then, a natural question is whether something mathematically interesting can be said about these underlying computational calculi.

Conversely, [[combinatory logic]] and [[simply typed lambda calculus]] are not the only [[models of computation]], either.  Girard's [[linear logic]] was developed from the fine analysis of the use of resources in some models of lambda calculus; is there typed version of [[Turing machine|Turing's machine]] that would behave as a proof system? [[Typed assembly language]]s are such an instance of "low-level" models of computation that carry types.

Because of the possibility of writing non-terminating programs, [[Turing-complete]] models of computation (such as languages with arbitrary [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]]) must be interpreted with care, as naive application of the correspondence leads to an inconsistent logic.  The best way of dealing with arbitrary computation from a logical point of view is still an actively debated research question, but one popular approach is based on using [[Monad (functional programming)|monads]] to segregate provably terminating from potentially non-terminating code (an approach that also generalizes to much richer models of computation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Eugenio|last=Moggi|year=1991|title=Notions of Computation and Monads|journal=Information and Computation|volume=93|issue=1|url=http://www.disi.unige.it/person/MoggiE/ftp/ic91.pdf|doi=10.1016/0890-5401(91)90052-4|pages=55–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is itself related to modal logic by a natural extension of the Curry–Howard isomorphism&lt;ref name=PfenningDaviesJudgmental group=ext/&gt;).  A more radical approach, advocated by [[total functional programming]], is to eliminate unrestricted recursion (and forgo [[Turing completeness]], although still retaining high computational complexity), using more controlled [[corecursion]] wherever non-terminating behavior is actually desired.

==General formulation==
In its more general formulation, the Curry–Howard correspondence is a correspondence between formal [[proof calculus|proof calculi]] and [[type systems]] for [[model of computation|models of computation]]. In particular, it splits into two correspondences. One at the level of [[formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] and [[data type|types]] that is independent of which particular proof system or model of computation is considered, and one at the level of [[mathematical proof|proofs]] and [[computer program|programs]] which, this time, is specific to the particular choice of proof system and model of computation considered.

At the level of formulas and types, the correspondence says that implication behaves the same as a function type, conjunction as a "product" type (this may be called a tuple, a struct, a list, or some other term depending on the language), disjunction as a sum type (this type may be called a union), the false formula as the empty type and the true formula as the singleton type (whose sole member is the null object). Quantifiers correspond to [[dependent type|dependent]] function space or products (as appropriate). 
&lt;!-- If quantification comes in two flavors, it is because there are two ways to think about the Curry–Howard correspondence. If one considers that every single proof step has to be computational, then [[universal quantification]] is interpreted as dependent product and [[existential quantification]] as a dependent sum (this corresponds to interpreting a proof as a term typed  [[simply typed lambda calculus|à la Church]]). If otherwise one considers that some trivial computational step can be omitted, then universal quantification is interpreted as a dependent [[Type_system#Intersection_types|intersection type]] and existential quantification as a dependent [[Type_system#Union_types|union type]] (this corresponds to interpreting a proof as a term typed [[simply typed lambda calculus|à la Curry]], which was actually the approach taken by Howard). --&gt; 
This is summarized in the following table:

! style="width:300px" | Programming side
|-

|- 
| [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] || [[sum type]]
|-

|-

|-
|}

At the level of proof systems and models of computations, the correspondence mainly shows the identity of structure, first, between some particular formulations of systems known as [[Hilbert-style deduction system]] and [[combinatory logic]], and, secondly, between some particular formulations of systems known as [[natural deduction]] and [[lambda calculus]].

== Corresponding systems ==

===Hilbert-style deduction systems and combinatory logic===
It was at the beginning a simple remark in Curry and Feys's 1958 book on combinatory logic: the simplest types for the basic combinators K and S of [[combinatory logic]] surprisingly corresponded to the respective [[axiom scheme]]s α → (β → α) and (α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ)) used in [[Hilbert-style deduction system]]s. For this reason, these schemes are now often called axioms K and S. Examples of programs seen as proofs in a Hilbert-style logic are given [[#Examples|below]].

If one restricts to the implicational intuitionistic fragment, a simple way to formalize logic in Hilbert's style is as follows. Let Γ be a finite collection of formulas, considered as hypotheses. Then δ is ''derivable'' from Γ, denoted Γ ⊢ δ, in the following cases:

* δ is an hypothesis, i.e. it is a formula of Γ,
* δ is an instance of an axiom scheme; i.e., under the most common axiom system:
** δ has the form α → (β → α), or
** δ has the form (α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ)),
* δ follows by deduction, i.e., for some α, both α → δ and α are already derivable from Γ (this is the rule of [[modus ponens]])

This can be formalized using [[inference rules]], as in the left column of the following table.

Typed combinatory logic can be formulated using a similar syntax: let Γ be a finite collection of variables, annotated with their types. A term T (also annotated with its type) will depend on these variables [Γ ⊢ T:δ] when:

* T is one of the variables in Γ,
* T is a basic combinator; i.e., under the most common combinator basis:
** T is K:α → (β → α) [where α and β denote the types of its arguments], or
** T is S:(α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ)),
* T is the composition of two subterms which depend on the variables in Γ.

The generation rules defined here are given in the right-column below. Curry's remark simply states that both columns are in one-to-one correspondence. The restriction of the correspondence to [[intuitionistic logic]] means that some [[Classical logic|classical]] [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], such as [[Peirce's law]] ((α → β) → α) → α, are excluded from the correspondence.

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma \vdash E_1:\alpha \rightarrow \beta \qquad \Gamma \vdash E_2:\alpha}{\Gamma \vdash E_1\;E_2:\beta} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Seen at a more abstract level, the correspondence can be restated as shown in the following table. Especially, the [[deduction theorem]] specific to Hilbert-style logic matches the process of [[Combinatory logic#Conversion of a lambda term to an equivalent combinatorial term|abstraction elimination]] of combinatory logic.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"

|- 
| axioms || combinators
|- 
| modus ponens || application
|- 
| [[deduction theorem]]  || [[Combinatory logic#Conversion of a lambda term to an equivalent combinatorial term|abstraction elimination]]
|}

Thanks to the correspondence, results from combinatory logic can be transferred to Hilbert-style logic and vice versa. For instance, the notion of [[combinatory logic#Reduction in combinatory logic|reduction]] of terms in combinatory logic can be transferred to Hilbert-style logic and it provides a way to canonically transform proofs into other proofs of the same statement. One can also transfer the notion of normal terms to a notion of normal proofs, expressing that the hypotheses of the axioms never need to be all detached (since otherwise a simplification can happen).

Conversely, the non provability in intuitionistic logic of [[Peirce's law]] can be transferred back to combinatory logic: there is no typed term of combinatory logic that is typable with type ((α → β) → α) → α.

Results on the completeness of some sets of combinators or axioms can also be transferred. For instance, the fact that the combinator '''X''' constitutes a [[Combinatory logic#One-point basis|one-point basis]] of (extensional) combinatory logic implies that the single axiom scheme
:(((α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ))) → ((δ → (ε → δ)) → ζ)) → ζ,
which is the [[principal type]] of '''X''', is an adequate replacement to the combination of the axiom schemes 
:α → (β → α) and
:(α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ)).

===Natural deduction and lambda calculus===
After [[Haskell Curry|Curry]] emphasized the syntactic correspondence between [[Hilbert-style deduction system|Hilbert-style deduction]] and [[combinatory logic]], [[William Alvin Howard|Howard]] made explicit in 1969 a syntactic analogy between the programs of [[simply typed lambda calculus]] and the proofs of [[natural deduction]]. Below, the left-hand side formalizes intuitionistic implicational natural deduction as a calculus of [[sequent]]s (the use of sequents is standard in discussions of the Curry–Howard isomorphism as it allows the deduction rules to be stated more cleanly) with implicit weakening and the right-hand side shows the typing rules of [[lambda calculus]]. In the left-hand side, Γ, Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; denote ordered sequences of formulas while in the right-hand side, they denote sequences of named (i.e., typed) formulas with all names different.

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma \vdash t:\alpha \rightarrow \beta \qquad \Gamma \vdash u:\alpha}{\Gamma \vdash t\;u:\beta} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

To paraphrase the correspondence, proving Γ ⊢ α means having a program that, given values with the types listed in Γ, manufactures an object of type α. An axiom corresponds to the introduction of a new variable with a new, unconstrained type, the →&amp;nbsp;I rule corresponds to function abstraction and the →&amp;nbsp;E rule corresponds to function application. Observe that the correspondence is not exact if the context Γ is taken to be a set of formulas as, e.g., the λ-terms λx.λy.x and λx.λy.y of type α → α → α would not be distinguished in the correspondence. Examples are given [[#Examples|below]].

Howard showed that the correspondence extends to other connectives of the logic and other constructions of simply typed lambda calculus. Seen at an abstract level, the correspondence can then be summarized as shown in the following table. Especially, it also shows that the notion of normal forms in [[lambda calculus]] matches [[Dag Prawitz|Prawitz]]'s notion of normal deduction in [[natural deduction]], from which it follows that the algorithms for the [[type inhabitation problem]] can be turned into algorithms for deciding [[intuitionistic]] provability.

Howard's correspondence naturally extends to other extensions of [[natural deduction]] and [[simply typed lambda calculus]]. Here is a non-exhaustive list:

The "lax" modality referred to is from {{Citation|last=Benton|last2=Bierman|last3=de Paiva|title=Computational types from a logical perspective|journal=Journal of Functional Programming|volume=8|pages=177–193|year=1998|doi=10.1017/s0956796898002998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical logic and control operators===
At the time of Curry, and also at the time of Howard, the proofs-as-programs correspondence concerned only [[intuitionistic logic]], i.e. a logic in which, in particular, [[Peirce's law]] was ''not'' deducible. The extension of the correspondence to Peirce's law and hence to [[classical logic]] became clear from the work of Griffin on typing operators that capture the evaluation context of a given program execution so that this evaluation context can be later on reinstalled. The basic Curry–Howard-style correspondence for classical logic is given below. Note the correspondence between the [[double-negation translation]] used to map classical proofs to intuitionistic logic and the [[continuation-passing style|continuation-passing-style]] translation used to map lambda terms involving control to pure lambda terms. More particularly, call-by-name continuation-passing-style translations relates to [[Kolmogorov]]'s double negation translation and call-by-value continuation-passing-style translations relates to a kind of double-negation translation due to Kuroda.

|}

A finer Curry–Howard correspondence exists for classical logic if one defines classical logic not by adding an axiom such as [[Peirce's law]], but by allowing several conclusions in sequents. In the case of classical natural deduction, there exists a proofs-as-programs correspondence with the typed programs of Parigot's [[lambda-mu calculus|λμ-calculus]].

===Sequent calculus===
A proofs-as-programs correspondence can be settled for the formalism known as [[Gentzen]]'s [[sequent calculus]] but it is not a correspondence with a well-defined pre-existing model of computation as it was for Hilbert-style and natural deductions.

Sequent calculus is characterized by the presence of left introduction rules, right introduction rule and a cut rule that can be eliminated. The structure of sequent calculus relates to a calculus whose structure is close to the one of some [[abstract machine]]s. The informal correspondence is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"
! style="width:200px" | Logic side
! style="width:200px" | Programming side
|- 
| cut elimination || reduction in a form of abstract machine 
|- 
| right introduction rules || constructors of code
|- 
| left introduction rules  || constructors of evaluation stacks
|- 
| priority to right-hand side in cut-elimination
| [[call-by-name]] reduction
|- 
| priority to left-hand side in cut-elimination
| [[call-by-value]] reduction
|}

==Related proofs-as-programs correspondences==

===The role of de Bruijn===

[[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|N. G. de Bruijn]] used the lambda notation for representing proofs of the theorem checker [[Automath]], and represented propositions as "categories" of their proofs.  It was in the late 1960s at the same period of time Howard wrote his manuscript; de Bruijn was likely unaware of Howard's work, and stated the correspondence independently (Sørensen &amp; Urzyczyn [1998] 2006, pp 98–99).  Some researchers tend to use the term Curry–Howard–de Bruijn correspondence in place of Curry–Howard correspondence.

===BHK interpretation===

The [[BHK interpretation]] interprets intuitionistic proofs as functions but it does not specify the class of functions relevant for the interpretation. If one takes lambda calculus for this class of function, then the [[BHK interpretation]] tells the same as Howard's correspondence between natural deduction and lambda calculus.

===Realizability===

[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]'s recursive [[realizability]] splits proofs of intuitionistic arithmetic into the pair of a recursive function and of
a proof of a formula expressing that the recursive function "realizes", i.e. correctly instantiates the disjunctions and existential quantifiers of the initial formula so that the formula gets true.

[[Georg Kreisel|Kreisel]]'s modified realizability applies to intuitionistic higher-order predicate logic and shows that the [[simply typed lambda calculus|simply typed lambda term]] inductively extracted from the proof realizes the initial formula. In the case of propositional logic, it coincides with Howard's statement: the extracted lambda term is the proof itself (seen as an untyped lambda term) and the realizability statement is a paraphrase of the fact that the extracted lambda term has the type that the formula means (seen as a type).

[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]'s [[dialectica interpretation]] realizes (an extension of) intuitionistic arithmetic with computable functions. The connection with lambda calculus is unclear, even in the case of natural deduction.

===Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence===
[[Joachim Lambek]] showed in the early 1970s that the proofs of intuitionistic propositional logic and the combinators of typed [[combinatory logic]] share a common equational theory which is the one of [[cartesian closed categories]]. The expression Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence is now used by some people to refer to the three way isomorphism between intuitionistic logic, typed lambda calculus and cartesian closed categories, with objects being interpreted as types or propositions and morphisms as terms or proofs. The correspondence works at the equational level and is not the expression of a syntactic identity of structures as it is the case for each of Curry's and Howard's correspondences: i.e. the structure of a well-defined morphism in a cartesian-closed category is not comparable to the structure of a proof of the corresponding judgment in either Hilbert-style logic or natural deduction.  To clarify this distinction, the underlying syntactic structure of cartesian closed categories is rephrased below.

Objects (types) are defined by
* &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; is an object
* if &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are objects then &lt;math&gt;\alpha \times \beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \rightarrow \beta&lt;/math&gt; are objects.

Morphisms (terms) are defined by
* &lt;math&gt;id&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{eval}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\pi_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2&lt;/math&gt; are morphisms
* if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism,  &lt;math&gt;\lambda t&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism
* if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; are morphisms, &lt;math&gt;(t, u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u \circ t&lt;/math&gt; are morphisms.

Well-defined morphisms (typed terms) are defined by the following [[type rule|typing rules]] (in which the usual categorical morphism notation &lt;math&gt;f : \alpha \to \beta&lt;/math&gt; is replaced with [[sequent calculus]] notation &lt;math&gt;f :\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta&lt;/math&gt;).

Identity:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{id:\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Composition:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t:\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta\qquad u:\!\!-~~ \beta ~\vdash~ \gamma}{u \circ t:\!\!- ~\alpha ~\vdash~ \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Unit type]] ([[terminal object]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{\star:\!\!-~~\alpha ~\vdash~ \top}&lt;/math&gt;

Cartesian product:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t:\!\!-~~\alpha ~\vdash~ \beta\qquad u:\!\!-~~\alpha ~\vdash~ \gamma}{(t,u):\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta \times \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

Left and right projection:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{\pi_1:\!\!-~~ \alpha \times \beta ~\vdash~ \alpha}\qquad\frac{}{\pi_2:\!\!-~~ \alpha \times \beta ~\vdash~ \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Currying]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t:\!\!-~~ \alpha \times \beta ~\vdash~ \gamma}{\lambda t:\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta \rightarrow \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Apply|Application]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{eval:\!\!-~~ (\alpha \rightarrow \beta) \times \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the equations of the category are
* &lt;math&gt;id \circ t = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;t \circ id = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(v \circ u) \circ t = v \circ (u \circ t)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\star = id&lt;/math&gt;  (if well-typed)
* &lt;math&gt;\star \circ u = \star&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\pi_1 \circ (t, u) = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\pi_2 \circ (t,u) = u&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(\pi_1, \pi_2) = id&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(t_1, t_2) \circ u = (t_1 \circ u, t_2 \circ u) &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;eval \circ (\lambda t \circ \pi_1, \pi_2) = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda eval = id&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda t \circ u  = \lambda (t \circ (u \circ \pi_1, \pi_2))&lt;/math&gt;

These equations imply the following &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;-laws:
* &lt;math&gt;(\pi_1 \circ t, \pi_2 \circ t) = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda (eval \circ (t \circ \pi_1, \pi_2)) = t&lt;/math&gt;

Now, there exists &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;t:\!\!-~ \alpha_1 \times \ldots \times \alpha_n \vdash \beta&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \vdash \beta &lt;/math&gt; is provable in implicational intuitionistic logic,.

==Examples==
Thanks to the Curry–Howard correspondence, a typed expression whose type corresponds to a logical formula is analogous to a proof of that formula. Here are examples.

===The identity combinator seen as a proof of &lt;tt&gt;α → α&lt;/tt&gt; in Hilbert-style logic===
As an example, consider a proof of the theorem &lt;tt&gt;α → α&lt;/tt&gt;. In [[lambda calculus]], this is the type of the identity function '''I''' = λ''x''.''x'' and in combinatory logic, the identity function is obtained by applying '''S''' = λ''fgx''.''fx(gx)'' twice to '''K''' = λ''xy''.''x''.  That is, '''I''' = (('''S''' '''K''') '''K'''). As a description of a proof, this says that the following steps can be used to prove &lt;tt&gt;α → α&lt;/tt&gt;:

* instantiate the second axiom scheme with the formulas &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;β → α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt;, so that to obtain a proof of &lt;tt&gt;(α → ((β → α) → α)) → ((α → (β → α)) → (α → α))&lt;/tt&gt;,
* instantiate the first axiom scheme once with &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;β → α&lt;/tt&gt;, so that to obtain a proof of &lt;tt&gt;α → ((β → α) → α)&lt;/tt&gt;,
* instantiate the first axiom scheme a second time with &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt;, so that to obtain a proof of &lt;tt&gt;α → (β → α)&lt;/tt&gt;,
* apply modus ponens twice so that to obtain a proof of &lt;tt&gt;α → α&lt;/tt&gt;

In general, the procedure is that whenever the program contains an application of the form (''P'' ''Q''), these steps should be followed:
# First prove theorems corresponding to the types of ''P'' and ''Q''. 
# Since ''P'' is being applied to ''Q'', the type of ''P'' must have the form α → β and the type of ''Q'' must have the form α for some &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt;. Therefore, it is possible to detach the conclusion, &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt;, via the modus ponens rule.

===The composition combinator seen as a proof of &lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt; in Hilbert-style logic===
As a more complicated example, let's look at the theorem that corresponds to the '''B''' function. The type of '''B''' is (β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α. '''B''' is equivalent to ('''S''' ('''K''' '''S''') '''K'''). This is our roadmap for the proof of the theorem (β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α.

The first step is to construct ('''K''' '''S'''). To make the antecedent of the '''K''' axiom look like the '''S''' axiom, set α equal to &lt;tt&gt;(α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt; equal to &lt;tt&gt;δ&lt;/tt&gt; (to avoid variable collisions):

:&lt;tt&gt;'''K''' : α → β → α&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;'''K'''[α = (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ, β=δ] : ((α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ) → δ → (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

Since the antecedent here is just '''S''', the consequent can be detached using Modus Ponens:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''K S''' : δ → (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

This is the theorem that corresponds to the type of ('''K''' '''S'''). Now apply '''S''' to this expression. Taking '''S''' as follows

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S''' : (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;,

put &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;δ&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;α → β → γ&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;γ&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;(α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;, yielding

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S'''[α = δ, β = α → β → γ, γ = (α → β) → α → γ] : (δ → (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ) → (δ → (α → β → γ)) → δ → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

and then detach the consequent:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S (K S)''' : (δ → α → β → γ) → δ → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

This is the formula for the type of ('''S''' ('''K''' '''S''')). A special case of this theorem has &lt;tt&gt;δ&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;(β → γ)&lt;/tt&gt;:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S (K S)'''[δ = β → γ] : ((β → γ) → α → β → γ) → (β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

This last formula must be applied to '''K'''. Specialize '''K''' again, this time by replacing &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;(β → γ)&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt;:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''K''' : α → β → α&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;'''K'''[α = β → γ, β = α] : (β → γ) → α → (β → γ)&lt;/tt&gt;

This is the same as the antecedent of the prior formula so, detaching the consequent:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S (K S) K''' : (β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

Switching the names of the variables &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;γ&lt;/tt&gt; gives us

:&lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt;

which was what remained to prove.

===The normal proof of &lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt; in natural deduction seen as a λ-term===
The diagram below gives proof of &lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt; in natural deduction and shows how it can be interpreted as the λ-expression λ ''a''. λ''b''. λ ''g''.(''a'' (''b'' ''g'')) of type &lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt;.

                                      a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ b : γ → β    a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ g : γ
 ———————————————————————————————————  ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
 a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ a : β → α      a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ b g : β
 ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
                a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ a (b g) : α
                ————————————————————————————————————
                a:β → α, b:γ → β ⊢ λ g. a (b g) : γ → α
                ————————————————————————————————————————
                         a:β → α ⊢ λ b. λ g. a (b g) : (γ → β) -&gt; γ → α
                         ————————————————————————————————————
                                 ⊢ λ a. λ b. λ g. a (b g) : (β → α) -&gt; (γ → β) -&gt; γ → α

==Other applications==
Recently, the isomorphism has been proposed as a way to define search space partition in [[genetic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Binard and A. Felty, "Genetic programming with polymorphic types and higher-order functions." In ''Proceedings of the 10th annual conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation,'' pages 1187 1194, 2008.[http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~afelty/dist/gecco08.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt; The method indexes sets of genotypes (the program trees evolved by the GP system) by their Curry–Howard isomorphic proof (referred to as a species).

==Generalizations==
The correspondences listed here go much farther and deeper. For example, cartesian closed categories are generalized by [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal categories]]. The [[internal language]] of these categories is the [[linear type system]] (corresponding to [[linear logic]]), which generalizes simply-typed lambda calculus as the internal language of cartesian closed categories. Moreover, these can be shown to correspond to [[cobordism]]s,&lt;ref&gt;John c. Baez and Mike Stay, "[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta/rose3.pdf Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone]", (2009) [https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340/ ArXiv 0903.0340] in ''New Structures for Physics'', ed. Bob Coecke, ''Lecture Notes in Physics'' vol. '''813''', Springer, Berlin, 2011, pp. 95–174.&lt;/ref&gt; which play a vital role in [[string theory]].

An extended set of equivalences is also explored in [[homotopy type theory]], which became a very active area of research around 2013 and {{As of|2018|lc=y}} still is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%22homotopy%20type%20theory%22 |title=homotopy type theory - Google Trends |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=trends.google.com |access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, [[type theory]] is extended by the [[univalence axiom]] ("equivalence is equivalent to equality") which permits homotopy type theory to be used as a foundation for all of mathematics (including [[set theory]] and classical logic, providing new ways to discuss the [[axiom of choice]] and many other things). That is, the Curry–Howard correspondence that proofs are elements of inhabited types is generalized to the notion [[homotopy|homotopic equivalence]] of proofs (as paths in space, the [[identity type]] or [[Intuitionistic type theory#Connectives of type theory|equality type]] of type theory being interpreted as a path).&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/ ''Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics''].

The '''distance geometry problem''' is that of [[characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] and study of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of points based ''only'' on given values of the [[distance]]s between member pairs.&lt;ref name=positioning /&gt;&lt;ref name=siam /&gt;&lt;ref name=DGAbook /&gt;  Therefore distance geometry has immediate relevance where distance values are determined or considered, such as [[biology]],&lt;ref name=crippen /&gt; sensor network,&lt;ref name=sensors /&gt; [[surveying]], [[cartography]], and [[physics]].

==Applications==

The distance geometry problem (DGP) is that of finding the [[coordinates]] of a set of points by using the distances between some pairs of such points.&lt;ref name=DGAbook/&gt; There exists nowadays a large community that is actively working on this problem, because there are several real-life applications that can lead to the formulation of a DGP. As an example, an interesting application is that of locating sensors in telecommunication networks.&lt;ref name=sensors/&gt; In such a case, the positions of some sensors are known (which are called anchors) and some of the distances between sensors (which can be anchors or not) are also known: the problem is to identify the positions in space for all sensors.

An interesting application arises in biology.&lt;ref name=crippen/&gt;&lt;ref name=blumenthal/&gt; Experimental techniques are able to estimate distances between pairs of atoms of a given molecule, and the problem becomes the one of identifying the three-dimensional conformation of the molecule, i.e. the positions of all its atoms. In this field, the main interest is on [[protein]]s, because discovering their three-dimensional conformation allows us to get clues about the function they are able to perform. The implications in related fields, such as [[biomedicine]] and [[drug design]], are evident. When dealing with biological molecules, the DGP is generally referred to as molecular DGP (MDGP).

In the following, even if the article considers in general the DGP, the MDGP will be used as an example.

==Basic issues==

A [[line (geometry)|straight line]] is the shortest path between two points.  Therefore the distance from ''A'' to ''B'' is no bigger than the length of the straight-line path from ''A'' to ''C'' plus the length of the straight-line path from ''C'' to ''B''.  This fact is called the [[triangle inequality]].  If that sum happens to be ''equal'' to the distance from ''A'' to ''B'', then the three points  ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' lie on a straight line, with ''C'' between ''A'' and ''B''.

Similarly, suppose one knows

* the distance from ''A'' to ''B'';
* the distance from ''A'' to ''C'';
* the distance from ''A'' to ''D'';
* the distance from ''B'' to ''C'';
* the distance from ''B'' to ''D''; and
* the distance from ''C'' to ''D''.

Knowing only these six numbers, one would like to figure out

* whether ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'' lie on a common straight line;
* whether ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' lie on a common line but ''D'' is not on that line (and similarly for any of ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' in the role of the one exceptional point);
* whether all four points lie in a common [[plane (geometry)|plane]] (whether they are [[coplanarity|coplanar]]);
* if they lie in a common plane, whether one of them is in the interior of the [[triangle]] formed by the other three, and if so, which one.

Distance geometry includes the solution of such problems.

==Cayley–Menger determinants==
Of particular utility and importance are classifications by means of '''Cayley–Menger [[determinant]]s''', named after [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[Karl Menger]]:

* a set Λ (with at least three distinct elements) is called '''straight''' [[if and only if]], for any three elements ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' of Λ,

::&lt;math&gt; \det \begin{bmatrix} 
       0 &amp; d(AB)^2 &amp; d(AC)^2 &amp; 1 \\
 d(AB)^2 &amp;    0    &amp; d(BC)^2 &amp; 1 \\
 d(AC)^2 &amp; d(BC)^2 &amp;       0 &amp; 1 \\
       1 &amp;       1 &amp;       1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

* a set Π (with at least four distinct elements) is called '''plane''' if and only if, for any four elements ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' of Π,

::&lt;math&gt; \det \begin{bmatrix} 
       0 &amp; d(AB)^2 &amp; d(AC)^2 &amp; d(AD)^2 &amp; 1 \\
 d(AB)^2 &amp;    0    &amp; d(BC)^2 &amp; d(BD)^2 &amp; 1 \\
 d(AC)^2 &amp; d(BC)^2 &amp;       0 &amp; d(CD)^2 &amp; 1 \\
 d(AD)^2 &amp; d(BD)^2 &amp; d(CD)^2 &amp;       0 &amp; 1 \\
       1 &amp;       1 &amp;       1 &amp; 1       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} = 0, &lt;/math&gt;
: but not all triples of elements of &amp;Pi; are straight to each other;

* a set Φ (with at least five distinct elements) is called '''flat''' if and only if, for any five elements ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' and ''E'' of Φ,

::&lt;math&gt; \det \begin{bmatrix} 
       0 &amp; d(AB)^2 &amp; d(AC)^2 &amp; d(AD)^2 &amp; d(AE)^2 &amp; 1 \\
 d(AB)^2 &amp;    0    &amp; d(BC)^2 &amp; d(BD)^2 &amp; d(BE)^2 &amp; 1 \\
 d(AC)^2 &amp; d(BC)^2 &amp;       0 &amp; d(CD)^2 &amp; d(CE)^2 &amp; 1 \\
 d(AD)^2 &amp; d(BD)^2 &amp; d(CD)^2 &amp;       0 &amp; d(DE)^2 &amp; 1 \\
 d(AE)^2 &amp; d(BE)^2 &amp; d(CE)^2 &amp; d(DE)^2 &amp;       0 &amp; 1 \\
       1 &amp;       1 &amp;       1 &amp; 1       &amp;       1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} = 0, &lt;/math&gt;
: but not all quadruples of elements of &amp;Phi; are plane to each other; and so on.

==Discretization and orders==

The DGP is, by definition, a [[constraint satisfaction]] problem. It is however generally reformulated as an [[optimization]] problem in a continuous space, and its solution is then attempted by using techniques for global optimization (see for example &lt;ref name=morewu/&gt;).

Under certain assumptions, however, the problem can be discretized, in the sense that the search domain of the optimization problem can be reduced to a discrete domain. When all distances are supposed to be exact (no experimental errors), the search domain becomes a [[binary tree]], where the candidate positions for the same atom of the molecule are given on a common layer of the tree.&lt;ref name=llm/&gt;&lt;ref name=mucherino/&gt; The discretization allows us to enumerate the entire solution set (this is not possible in general when using global optimization methods).

The discretization assumptions&lt;ref name=siam/&gt; are strongly based on the [[Sequence|order]] in which the atoms of the molecule are considered. When considering the atoms of the molecule in their natural ordering, such assumptions are generally not satisfied. An interesting and fundamental pre-processing step for the discretization of DGPs is, therefore, the problem of identifying an order for the atoms that allows for the discretization. This problem can be solved in polynomial time, when all distances are supposed to be exact, as well as when some available distance is represented by a suitable interval.&lt;ref name=idvop/&gt;

==Software for distance geometry==
* [http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~more/dgsol/ DGSOL]. It is based on the idea of approximating the penalty function with a sequence of smoother functions converging to the original objective function. It is usually used for performing comparisons to other newly proposed techniques, whose code is often not released. DGSOL solves distance geometry problems where a lower and an upper bound on the distances are available.
* [http://www.antoniomucherino.it/en/mdjeep.php MD-jeep]. This software is based on the discretization of the distance geometry problem. A Branch &amp; Prune algorithm is implemented for the solution of the problem. 
* [http://nmr.cit.nih.gov/xplor-nih/ Xplor-NIH]. It has been particularly designed for solving instances of the problem in which the data come from NMR experiments, and it includes different functionalities. In particular, for the solution of the distance geometry problems, it makes use of heuristic methods (such as Simulated Annealing) and local search methods (such as Conjugate Gradient Minimization).
* [http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/ TINKER]. This is a package for molecular modeling and design. It includes many force fields for attempting the prediction of protein conformations from their chemical structure only. One of its functionalities, however, is to solve distance geometry problems.
* [https://sites.google.com/site/nathankrislock/software SNLSDPclique]. This is a MATLAB code for solving the Sensor Network Localization problem using the semidefinite facial reduction method.

==Books and conferences==

Crippen and Havel are two pioneers of DGP, and they co-authored the book "Distance Geometry and Molecular Conformation",&lt;ref name=crippen/&gt; 1988. Much more recently, an edited book, collecting the most recent efforts from the scientific community for solving the DGP, was published by Springer.&lt;ref name=DGAbook/&gt; See [http://www.antoniomucherino.it/en/DG_edbook.php this web page] for the list of contributions.

Various conferences and workshops are held every year, where the focus is on DGP-related topics. However, the very first workshop completely devoted to DGP and its applications was held in 2013 in Manaus, Brazil: [http://dga2013.icomp.ufam.edu.br/ DGA13].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3400">'''Early Algebra''' is an approach to early [[mathematics]] teaching and learning. It is about teaching traditional topics in more profound ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlyalgebra.terc.edu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408024955/http://www.earlyalgebra.terc.edu/ |archivedate=2009-04-08 |df= }} TERC&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an area of research in [[mathematics education]].

Traditionally, algebra instruction has been postponed until adolescence. However, data of early algebra researchers shows ways to teach algebraic thinking much earlier. The [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] (NCTM) integrates algebra into its Principles and Standards starting from Kindergarten. 

One of the major goals of early algebra is generalizing number and set ideas. It moves from particular numbers to patterns in numbers. This includes generalizing arithmetic operations as functions, as well as engaging children in noticing and beginning to formalize properties of numbers and operations such as the commutative property, identities, and inverses.

Students historically have had a very difficult time adjusting to algebra for a number of reasons. Researchers&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, T.P., Franke, M.L., and Levi, L. Thinking Mathematically. (Heinemann, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; have found that by working with students on such ideas as developing rules for the use of letters to stand in for numbers and the true meaning of the equals symbol (it is a balance point, and does not mean "put the answer next"), children are much better prepared for formal algebra instruction.

Teacher professional development in this area consists of presenting common student misconceptions and then developing lessons to move students out of faulty ways of thinking and into correct generalizations. The use of true, false, and open number sentences can go a long way toward getting students thinking about the properties of number and operations and the meaning of the equals sign.

Research areas in early algebra include use of representations, such as symbols, graphs and tables; cognitive development of students; viewing arithmetic as a part of algebraic conceptual fields &lt;ref&gt;Vergnaud, G. Long terme et court terme dans l’apprentissage de l’algebre. In C. Laborde
(Ed.), Actes du premier colloque franco-allemand de didactique des mathematiques et de
l’informatique (pp. 189–199). (La Pensée Sauvage, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6273">In [[financial economics]] and [[accounting]], the '''earnings response coefficient''', or ERC, is the estimated relationship between [[return on equity|equity returns]] and the unexpected portion of (i.e., new information in) companies' earnings announcements.

[[Arbitrage pricing theory]] describes the theoretical relationship between information that is known to market participants about a particular equity (e.g., a common stock share of a particular company) and the price of that equity.  Under the [[efficient market hypothesis]], equity prices are expected in the aggregate to reflect all relevant information at a given time.  Market participants with superior information are expected to exploit that information until share prices have effectively impounded the information.  Therefore, in the aggregate, a portion of changes in a company's share price is expected to result from changes in the relevant information available to the market.  The ERC is an estimate of the change in a company's stock price due to the information provided in a company's earnings announcement.

The ERC is expressed mathematically as follows:

&lt;math&gt;UR = a + b(\text{ern}-u) + e&lt;/math&gt;

:UR = the unexpected return
:a = benchmark rate
:b = earning response coefficient
:(ern-u) = (actual earnings less expected earnings) = unexpected earnings 
:e = random movement

Earnings response coefficient research attempts to identify and explain the differential market response to earnings information of different firms.  An Earnings response coefficient measures the extent of security’s abnormal market return in response to the unexpected component of reported earnings of the firm issuing that security.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, W. R. (2014). Financial accounting theory. Toronto: Pearson. 7th ed,
 p 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between stock returns to profit to determine the extent of the response that occurs to as the Earnings Response Coefficient (ERC). Some studies reveal there are four factors that affect Earnings Response Coefficient (ERC), namely : beta, capital structure, persistence and growth. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Reasons==
Reasons for differential market response:
#'''''Beta'':''' The more risk related to the firm's expected returns the lower will be the investor's reactions to a given amount of unexpected earnings.(Note: beta shows risk of a security so you can assume that a high beta means a high risk).
#'''''Capital structure'':''' ERC for a highly leveraged firm is lower than for a firm with little or no debt, Any good news passed on means that the debt holders get this benefit instead of the investors. (Thus it is important to disclose the nature &amp; magnitude of financial instruments including off-balance sheet).
#'''''Persistence'':''' Source of increase in current earnings affects the ERC: If earnings are expected to persist into the future this will result in a higher ERC. If the component in the earnings is non-persistent (i.e. unusual, non recurring items) this will result in lower ERC.
#'''''Accruals quality'':''' The manager has considerable control over the amounts and timing of accruals. If the manager uses this control over accruals to influence the amount of reported net income, they are called discretionary accruals.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, W. R. (2014). Financial accounting theory. Toronto: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''''Growth Oopportunities'':''' Suppose that current net income reveals unexpectedly high profitability for some of the firm's recent investment projects. This may indicate to the market that the firm will enjoy strong growth in the future, hence ERC will be high.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, W. R. (2014). Financial accounting theory. Toronto: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''''The informativeness of price'':''' Because ''prices lead earnings'', and market prices aggregates all publicly known information about the firm, much of which the accounting system recognizes with a lag. Consequently, the more informative price is, the less the information content of current accounting earnings will be, other things equal, hence the lower the ERC.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, W. R. (2014). Financial accounting theory. Toronto: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use &amp; Debate==

ERCs are used primarily in research in [[accounting]] and [[finance]]. In particular, ERCs have been used in research in [[positive accounting]], a branch of [[financial accounting]] research, as they theoretically describe how markets react to different information events. Research in Finance has used ERCs to study, among other things, how different investors react to information events.&lt;ref&gt;Hotchkiss, Edith S. and Deon Strickland, 2003. "Does Shareholder Composition Matter? Evidence from the Market Reaction to Corporate Earnings Announcements," ''Journal of Finance'', 58(4), pp.&amp;nbsp;1469-1498.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some debate concerning the true nature and strength of the ERC relationship. As demonstrated in the above model, the ERC is generally considered to be the slope coefficient of a [[linear equation]] between unexpected earnings and equity return. However, certain research results suggest that the relationship is [[nonlinear regression|nonlinear]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Robert and Senyo Tse, 1992. "A Nonlinear Model of Security Price Responses to Unexpected Earnings," ''Journal of Accounting Research'', Vol. 30 No. 2 (Autumn), pp.&amp;nbsp;185-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward John Routh''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|r|aʊ|θ}}; 20 January 1831 – 7 June 1907), was an English mathematician, noted as the outstanding coach of students preparing for the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Mathematical Tripos]] examination of the [[University of Cambridge]] in its heyday in the middle of the nineteenth century. He also did much to systematise the mathematical theory of [[mechanics]] and created several ideas critical to the development of modern [[control theory|control systems theory]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Routh was born of an English father and a French-Canadian mother in [[Quebec]], at that time the British colony of [[Lower Canada]]. His father's family could trace its history back to the [[Norman conquest]] when it acquired land at [[Routh, East Riding of Yorkshire|Routh]] near [[Beverley]], Yorkshire. His mother's family, the Taschereau family, was well-established in Quebec, tracing their ancestry back to the early days of the French colony.  His parents were Sir [[Randolph Isham Routh]] (1782–1858) and his second wife, Marie Louise Taschereau (1810–1891).&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; Sir Randolph was Commissary General of the British Army 1826, Chairman of the Irish Famine Relief Commission (1845–48) and Deputy Commissary General at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and Marie Louise was the daughter of Judge [[Jean-Thomas Taschereau (1778-1832)|Jean-Thomas Taschereau]] and the sister of Judge [[Jean-Thomas Taschereau (jurist)|Jean-Thomas]] and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Elzéar-Alexandre Taschereau]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/35850|title=Routh, Edward John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Routh came to England aged eleven and attended [[University College School]] and then entered [[University College, London]] in 1847, having won a scholarship. There he studied under [[Augustus De Morgan]], whose influence led to Routh to decide on a career in mathematics.&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt;

Routh obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] (1849) and [[Master of Arts|MA]] (1853) in London.&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt; He attended [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]], where he was taught by [[Isaac Todhunter]] and coached by "senior wrangler maker" [[William Hopkins]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; In 1854, Routh graduated just above [[James Clerk Maxwell]], as [[Senior Wrangler]], sharing the [[Smith's prize]] with him.&lt;ref name="acad" /&gt; Routh was elected [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellow]] of Peterhouse in 1856.&lt;ref name="acad"&gt;{{acad|id=RT850EJ|name=Routh, Edward John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics tutor===
On graduation, Routh took up work as a private mathematics tutor in Cambridge and took on the pupils of [[William John Steele]] during the latter's fatal illness, though insisting that Steele take the fees. Routh inherited Steele's pupils, going on to establish an unbeaten record as a coach. He coached over 600 pupils between 1855 and 1888, 28 of them making Senior Wrangler, as to Hopkins' 17 with 43 of his pupils winning the Smith Prize.&lt;ref name="acad" /&gt;

Routh worked conscientiously and systematically, taking rigidly timetabled classes of ten pupils during the day and spending the evenings preparing extra material for the ablest men.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; "His lectures were enlivened by mathematical jokes of a rather heavy kind."&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Routh was a staunch defender of the Cambridge competitive system and despaired when the university started to publish examination results in alphabetical order, observing "They will want to run [[the Derby]] alphabetically next".&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

===Private life===
[[Astronomer Royal]] [[George Biddell Airy]] sought to entice Routh to work at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]]. Though Airy did not succeed, at Greenwich Routh met Airy's eldest daughter Hilda (1840–1916) whom he married in 1864. At the time, the university had a celibacy requirement, forcing Routh to vacate his fellowship and move out of Peterhouse.&lt;ref name="Warwick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warwick|first1=Andrew|title=Masters of Theory: Cambridge and the Rise of Mathematical Physics|date=13 June 2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226873749|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the reformation of the college statutes, removing the celibacy requirement, Routh was the first person elected to an honorary fellowship by Peterhouse.&lt;ref name="Warwick" /&gt; The couple had five sons and a daughter. Routh was a "kindly man and a good conversationalist with friends, but with strangers he was shy and reserved."&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

===Honours===
*[[Fellow of the Royal Society]], (1872);&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;
*[[Adams Prize]], (1877).&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Work==
Routh collaborated with [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] on the ''Analytical View of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia'' (1855). He published a [[textbook]], ''Dynamics of a System of Rigid Bodies'' (1860, 6th ed. 1897) in which he did much to define and systematise the modern mathematical approach to [[mechanics]]. This influenced [[Felix Klein]] and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]]. In fact, Klein arranged the German translation.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; It also did much to influence [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] and [[Peter Guthrie Tait]]'s ''[[Treatise on Natural Philosophy]]'' (1867).&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt; The [[Routhian]], which can be obtained from the Lagrangian by the [[Legendre transform]], in classical mechanics is named in his honour.

===Stability and control===
In addition to his intensive work in teaching and writing, which had a persistent effect on the presentation of [[mathematical physics]], he also contributed original research such as the [[Routh-Hurwitz theorem]].

Central tenets of modern [[Control theory|control systems theory]] relied upon the [[Routh stability criterion]] (though nowadays due to modern computers it is not as important), an application of [[Sturm's Theorem]] to evaluate [[cauchy index|Cauchy indices]] through the use of the [[euclid's algorithm|Euclidean algorithm]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7288">'''Finsler's lemma''' is a mathematical result named after [[Paul Finsler]].  It states equivalent ways to express the [[Positive definite|positive definiteness]] of a quadratic form ''Q'' constrained by a linear form ''L''. 
Since it is equivalent to another lemmas used in optimization and control theory, such as [[S-lemma|Yakubovich's S-lemma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zi-Zong|first1=Yan|last2=Jin-Hai|first2=Guo|title=Some Equivalent Results with Yakubovich's S-Lemma|journal=SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization|date=2010|volume=48|issue=7|pages=4474–4480|doi=10.1137/080744219}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Finsler's lemma has been given many proofs and has been widely used, particularly in results related to [[robust optimization]] and [[Linear matrix inequality|linear matrix inequalities]]. 

== Statement of Finsler's lemma ==

Let {{math|''x'' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''Q'' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n x n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''L'' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n x n''&lt;/sup&gt; }} . The following statements are equivalent:&lt;ref name="Fin:36"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finsler|first1=Paul|title=Über das Vorkommen definiter und semidefiniter Formen in Scharen quadratischer Formen|journal=Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici|volume=9|issue=1|pages=188-192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x^{T}Lx=0 \text{ and } x \ne 0 \text{ implies } x^T Q x &lt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\exists \mu \in \mathbb{R} : Q - \mu L \prec 0. &lt;/math&gt;

== Variants ==
In the particular case that ''L'' is positive semi-definite, it is possible to decompose it as {{math|1=''L''  = ''B''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''B''|''L'' = }}. The following statements, which are also referred as Finsler's lemma in the literature, are equivalent:&lt;ref name="deOS:01"&gt;{{cite book|title=Perspectives in robust control|last1=de Oliveira|first1=Maurício C.|last2=Skelton|first2=Robert E.|date=2001|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-1-84628-576-9|editor1-last=Moheimani|editor1-first=S. O. Reza|location=London|pages=241-257|chapter=Stability tests for constrained linear systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt; x^T Q x &lt; 0 \text{ for all } x \in \ker(B)\smallsetminus\{0\} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; B^{\perp^T} Q B^\perp \prec 0 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \exists \mu \in \mathbb{R} : Q - \mu B^T B \prec 0 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \exists X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m} : Q + XB + B^T X^T \prec 0 &lt;/math&gt;

== Generalizations ==

=== Projection lemma ===

The following statement, known as Projection Lemma (or also as Elimination Lemma), is common on the literature of [[Linear matrix inequality|linear matrix inequalities]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611970777|title=Linear Matrix Inequalities in System and Control Theory|last=Boyd|first=S.|last2=El Ghaoui|first2=L.|last3=Feron|first3=E.|last4=Balakrishnan|first4=V.|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|isbn=9780898714852|series=Studies in Applied and Numerical Mathematics|doi=10.1137/1.9781611970777}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; B^{\perp^T} Q B^\perp \prec 0 \text{ and } C^{T \perp T} Q C^{T \perp} \prec 0 &lt;/math&gt; 
* &lt;math&gt; \exists X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m} : Q + CXB + B^T X^T C^T \prec 0 &lt;/math&gt;
This can be seen as a generalization of one of Finsler's lemma variants with the inclusion of an extra matrix and an extra constraint.

=== Robust version ===
Finsler's lemma also generalizes for matrices ''Q'' and ''B'' depending on a parameter ''s'' within a set ''S''. In this case, it is natural to ask if the same variable μ (respectively ''X'') can satisfy &lt;math&gt;Q(s)-\mu B^{T}(s)B(s) \prec 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;s\in S&lt;/math&gt; (respectively, &lt;math&gt;Q(s) + X(s)B(s)+B^T(s)X^T(s) \prec 0&lt;/math&gt;). If ''Q'' and ''B'' depends continuously on the parameter ''s'', and ''S'' is [[Compact car|compact]], then this is true. If ''S'' is not compact, but ''Q'' and ''B'' are still continuous matrix-valued functions, then μ and ''X'' can be guaranteed to be at least continuous functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ishihara|first=J.

== Applications ==

=== S-Variable approach to robust control of linear dynamical systems ===

=== Sufficient condition for universal stabilizability of non-linear systems ===
A non-linear system has the universal stabilizability property if every forward-complete solution of a system can be globally stabilized. By the use of Finsler's lemma, it is possible to derive a sufficient condition for universal stabilizability in terms of a differential linear matrix inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manchester|first=I.

'''''History of the Theory of Numbers''''' is a three-volume work by [[L. E. Dickson]]  summarizing work in [[number theory]] up to about 1920. The style is unusual in that Dickson mostly just lists results by various authors, with little further discussion. The central topic of [[quadratic reciprocity]] and higher [[reciprocity law]]s is barely mentioned; this was apparently going to be the topic of a fourth volume that was never written {{harv|Fenster|1999}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35542">[[File:Hott book cover.png|thumb|Cover of ''Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics''.]]
In [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]], '''homotopy type theory''' ('''HoTT''' {{IPAc-en|h|ɒ|t}}) is the [[Reification (knowledge representation)|reification]] turning the judgement that two terms of a given type are equal in [[intensional type theory]] into an actual identity type. More broadly, homotopy type theory refers to various lines of development of [[intensional type theory]], based on the interpretation of types as objects to which the intuition of (abstract) [[homotopy theory]] applies.
		 	
This includes, among other lines of work, the construction of homotopical and [[Higher category theory|higher-categorical]] [[Model (mathematical logic)|models]] for such type theories; the use of type theory as a logic (or [[internal language]]) for abstract homotopy theory and [[higher category theory]]; the development of mathematics within a type-theoretic [[foundation of mathematics|foundation]] (including both previously existing mathematics and new mathematics that homotopical types make possible); and the [[Formal proof|formalization]] of each of these in computer [[proof assistant]]s.

There is a large overlap between the work referred to as homotopy type theory, and as the [[univalent foundations]] project.  Although neither is precisely delineated, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, the choice of usage also sometimes corresponds to differences in viewpoint and emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Shulman|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Shulman (mathematician) |eprint=1601.05035v3|title=Homotopy Type Theory: A synthetic approach to higher equalities |date=2016-01-27}}, footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, this article may not represent the views of all researchers in the fields equally. This kind of variability is unavoidable when a field is in rapid flux.

== History ==

===Prehistory: the groupoid model===
At one time the idea that types in [[Intuitionistic type theory#Extensional versus intensional|intensional type theory]] with their identity types could be regarded as groupoids was [[mathematical folklore]]. It was first made precise semantically in the 1998 paper of Martin Hofmann and [[Thomas Streicher]] called "The groupoid interpretation of type theory", in which they showed that intensional type theory had a model in the category of [[groupoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Martin |last1=Hofmann |last2=Streicher |first2=Thomas |author2-link=Thomas Streicher| chapter=The groupoid interpretation of type theory |mr=1686862 |editor1-first=Giovanni |editor1-last=Sambin |editor2-first=Jan M. |editor2-last=Smith |title=Twenty Five Years of Constructive Type Theory |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLnKggT_In4C&amp;pg=PA83 |date=1998 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-158903-4 |pages=83–111 |series=Oxford Logic Guides |volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first truly "[[Homotopical algebra|homotopical]]" model of type theory, albeit only "1-[[dimension]]al" (the traditional models in the [[category of sets]] being homotopically 0-dimensional).

Their paper also foreshadowed several later developments in homotopy type theory. For instance, they noted that the groupoid model satisfies a rule they called "universe extensionality", which is none other than the restriction to 1-types of the ''univalence axiom'' that [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] proposed ten years later. (The axiom for 1-types is notably simpler to formulate, however, since a [[Coherence condition|coherence]] notion of "equivalence" is not required.)  They also defined "categories with isomorphism as equality" and conjectured that in a model using higher-dimensional groupoids, for such categories one would have "equivalence is equality"; this was later proven by Benedikt Ahrens, Krzysztof Kapulkin, and [[Michael Shulman (mathematician)|Michael Shulman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Benedikt |last=Ahrens |first2=Krzysztof |last2=Kapulkin |first3=Michael |last3=Shulman |author3-link=Michael Shulman (mathematician)|title=Univalent categories and the Rezk completion |journal=Mathematical Structures in Computer Science |volume=25 |year=2015|issue= 5|pages= 1010–1039|arxiv=1303.0584 |doi=10.1017/S0960129514000486|mr=3340533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history: model categories and higher groupoids===
The first higher-dimensional models of intensional type theory were constructed by Steve Awodey and his student Michael Warren in 2005 using [[Model category|Quillen model categories]]. These results were first presented in public at the conference FMCS 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~robin/FMCS/FMCS_06/FMCS06.html Foundational Methods in Computer Science, University of Calgary, June 7th - 9th, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; at which Warren gave a talk titled "Homotopy models of intensional type theory", which also served as his thesis prospectus (the dissertation committee present were Awodey, Nicola Gambino and Alex Simpson). A summary is contained in Warren's thesis prospectus abstract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mawarren.net/papers/prospectus.pdf Michael Warren, "Homotopy Models of Intensional Type Theory"]&lt;/ref&gt;

At a subsequent workshop about identity types at [[Uppsala University]] in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.math.uu.se/~palmgren/itt/ Identity Types - Topological and Categorical Structure, Workshop, Uppsala, November 13-14, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  there were two talks about the relation between intensional type theory and factorization systems: one by Richard Garner, "Factorisation systems for type theory",&lt;ref&gt;[http://comp.mq.edu.au/~rgarner/Papers/Uppsala.pdf Richard Garner, Factorisation axioms for type theory]&lt;/ref&gt; and one by Michael Warren, "Model categories and intensional identity types". Related ideas were discussed in the talks by [[Steve Awodey]], "Type theory of higher-dimensional categories", and [[Thomas Streicher]], "Identity types vs. weak omega-groupoids: some ideas, some problems". At the same conference Benno van den Berg gave a talk titled "Types as weak omega-categories" where he outlined the ideas that later became the subject of a joint paper with Richard Garner.

All early constructions of higher dimensional models had to deal with the problem of coherence typical of models of dependent type theory, and various solutions were developed. One such was given in 2009 by Voevodsky, another in 2010 by van den Berg and Garner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |first=Benno van den |last=Berg |first2=Richard |last2=Garner |title=Topological and simplicial models of identity types |date=27 July 2010 |arxiv=1007.4638}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general solution, building on Voevodsky's construction, was eventually given by Lumsdaine and Warren in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter LeFanu |last=Lumsdaine |first2=Michael A. |last2=Warren |title=The local universes model: an overlooked coherence construction for dependent type theories |date=6 November 2014 |arxiv=1411.1736 |doi=10.1145/2754931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the PSSL86 in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/psslHomeEN.html 86th edition of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic, Henri Poincaré University, September 8-9 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Awodey gave a talk titled "Homotopy type theory" (this was the first public usage of that term, which was coined by Awodey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/listPart.html Preliminary list of PSSL86 participants]&lt;/ref&gt;). Awodey and Warren summarized their results in the paper "Homotopy theoretic models of identity types", which was posted on the [[ArXiv]] preprint server in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steve |last=Awodey |first2=Michael A. |last2=Warren |title=Homotopy theoretic models of identity types |date=3 September 2007 |publisher=Cornell University Library |arxiv=0709.0248 |doi=10.1017/S0305004108001783 |volume=146 |journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |page=45|bibcode=2008MPCPS.146...45A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 2009; a more detailed version appeared in Warren's thesis "Homotopy theoretic aspects of constructive type theory" in 2008.

At about the same time, Vladimir Voevodsky was independently investigating type theory in the context of the search of a language for practical formalization of mathematics. In September 2006 he posted to the Types mailing list  "A very short note on homotopy [[lambda calculus]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/Voevodsky_note.ps ''A very short note on homotopy λ-calculus'', by Vladimir Voevodsky, September 27, 2006] PDF&lt;/ref&gt; which sketched the outlines of a type theory with dependent products, sums and universes and of a model of this type theory in Kan [[simplicial set]]s. It began by saying "The homotopy λ-calculus is a hypothetical (at the moment) type system" and ended with "At the moment much of what I said above is at the level of conjectures. Even the definition of the model of TS in the homotopy category is non-trivial" referring to the complex coherence issues that were not resolved until 2009. This note included a syntactic definition of "equality types" that were claimed to be interpreted in the model by path-spaces, but did not consider [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s rules for identity types. It also stratified the universes by homotopy dimension in addition to size, an idea that later was mostly discarded.

On the syntactic side, Benno van den Berg conjectured in 2006 that the tower of identity types of a type in intensional type theory should have the structure of an ω-category, and indeed a ω-groupoid, in the "globular, algebraic" sense of Michael Batanin. This was later proven independently by van den Berg and Garner in the paper "Types are weak omega-groupoids" (published 2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Benno |last=van den Berg |first2=Richard |last2=Garner |title=Types are weak omega-groupoids |date=1 December 2007 |publisher=Cornell University Library |arxiv=0812.0298 |doi=10.1112/plms/pdq026}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Peter Lumsdaine in the paper "Weak ω-Categories from Intensional Type Theory" (published 2009) and as part of his 2010 Ph.D. thesis "Higher Categories from Type Theories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Lumsdaine |title=Higher Categories from Type Theories |date=2010 |type=Ph.D. |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University |url=http://lib.rett.org.uk/~peterlefanulumsdaine/research/Lumsdaine-2010-Thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The univalence axiom, synthetic homotopy theory, and higher inductive types===
The concept of a univalent fibration was introduced by Voevodsky in early 2006&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/vladimirias/2006_Mar_Homotopy_lambda_calculus Notes on homotopy lambda calculus, March 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, because of the insistence of all presentations of the Martin-Löf type theory on the property that the identity types, in the empty context, may contain only reflexivity, Voevodsky did not recognize until 2009 that these identity types can be used in combination with the univalent universes. In particular, the idea that univalence can be introduced simply by adding an axiom to the existing Martin-Löf type theory appeared only in 2009.

Also in 2009, Voevodsky worked out more of the details of a model of type theory in [[Kan complex]]es, and observed that the existence of a universal [[Kan fibration]] could be used to resolve the coherence problems for categorical models of type theory. He also proved, using an idea of A. K. Bousfield,  that this universal fibration was univalent: the associated fibration of pairwise homotopy equivalences between the fibers is equivalent to the paths-space fibration of the base.

To formulate univalence as an axiom Voevodsky found a way  to define "equivalences" syntactically that had the important property that the type representing the statement "f is an equivalence" was (under the assumption of function extensionality) (-1)-truncated (i.e. contractible if inhabited). This enabled him to give a ''syntactic'' statement of univalence, generalizing Hofmann and Streicher's "universe extensionality" to higher dimensions. He was also able to use these definitions of equivalences and contractibility to start developing significant amounts of "synthetic homotopy theory" in the proof assistant [[Coq]]; this formed the basis of the library later called "Foundations" and eventually "UniMath".&lt;ref name=UniMath&gt;[https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath GitHub repository, Univalent Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unification of the various threads began in February 2010 with an informal meeting at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], where Voevodsky presented his model in Kan complexes and his Coq code to a group including Awodey, Warren, Lumsdaine, and [[Robert Harper (computer scientist)|Robert Harper]], Dan Licata, [[Michael Shulman (mathematician)|Michael Shulman]], and others. This meeting produced the outlines of a proof (by Warren, Lumsdaine, Licata, and Shulman) that every homotopy equivalence is an equivalence (in Voevodsky's good coherent sense), based on the idea from category theory of improving equivalences to adjoint equivalences. Soon afterwards, Voevodsky proved that the univalence axiom implies function extensionality.

The next pivotal event was a mini-workshop at the [[Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach]] in March 2011 organized by Steve Awodey, Richard Garner, Per Martin-Löf, and Vladimir Voevodsky, titled "The homotopy interpretation of constructive type theory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hottheory.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/report-11_2011.pdf Mini-Workshop: ''The Homotopy Interpretation of Constructive Type Theory'', Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach, February 27th – March 5th, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a Coq tutorial for this workshop, Andrej Bauer wrote a small Coq library.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/andrejbauer/Homotopy GitHub repository, Andrej Bauer, Homotopy theory in Coq]&lt;/ref&gt; based on Voevodsky's ideas (but not actually using any of his code); this eventually became the kernel of the first version of the "HoTT" Coq library&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/commit/1fb4ed9e5cdc5494f26ae6d13c4ebc851b81e1ba GitHub Basic homotopy type theory, Andrej Bauer &amp; Vladimir Voevodsky, Apr 29, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; (the first commit of the latter&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT GitHub repository, Homotopy type theory]&lt;/ref&gt; by Michael Shulman notes "Development based on Andrej Bauer's files, with many ideas taken from Vladimir Voevodsky's files"). One of the most important things to come out of the Oberwolfach meeting was the basic idea of higher inductive types, due to Lumsdaine, Shulman, Bauer, and Warren. The participants also formulated a list of important open questions, such as whether the univalence axiom satisfies canonicity (still open, although some special cases have been resolved positively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Shulman |title=Univalence for inverse diagrams and homotopy canonicity |date=15 March 2012 |publisher=Cornell University Library |arxiv=1203.3253 |doi=10.1017/S0960129514000565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~drl/pubs/lh112tt/lh112tt.pdf ''Canonicity for 2-Dimensional Type Theory'', by Daniel R. Licata and Robert Harper, Carnegie Mellon University, July 21, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;), whether the univalence axiom has nonstandard models (since answered positively by Shulman), and how to define (semi)simplicial types (still open in MLTT, although it can be done in Voevodsky's Homotopy Type System (HTS), a type theory with two equality types).

Soon after the Oberwolfach workshop, the ''Homotopy Type Theory website and blog''&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; was established, and the subject began to be popularized under that name. An idea of some of the important progress during this period can be obtained from the blog history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/blog Homotopy Type Theory blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Univalent foundations==
The phrase "univalent foundations" is agreed by all to be closely related to homotopy type theory, but not everyone uses it in the same way.  It was originally used by Vladimir Voevodsky to refer to his vision of a foundational system for mathematics in which the basic objects are homotopy types, based on a type theory satisfying the univalence axiom, and formalized in a computer proof assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/ Type Theory and Univalent Foundations]&lt;/ref&gt;

As Voevodsky's work became integrated with the community of other researchers working on homotopy type theory, "univalent foundations" was sometimes used interchangeably with "homotopy type theory",&lt;ref name=hott/&gt;  and other times to refer only to its use as a foundational system (excluding, for example, the study of model-categorical semantics or computational metatheory).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncatlab.org/homotopytypetheory/show/References Homotopy Type Theory: References]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the subject of the IAS special year was officially given as "univalent foundations", although a lot of the work done there focused on semantics and metatheory in addition to foundations.  The book produced by participants in the IAS program was titled "Homotopy type theory: Univalent foundations of mathematics"; although this could refer to either usage, since the book only discusses HoTT as a mathematical foundation.&lt;ref name=hott/&gt;

[[File:The making of HoTT book.webm|thumb|An animation showing development of the HoTT Book on the GitHub repository by the participants in the Univalent Foundations Special Year project.]]
In 2012–13 researchers at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] held "A Special Year on Univalent Foundations of Mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.math.ias.edu/sp/univalent IAS school of mathematics:  Special Year on The Univalent Foundations of Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;  The special year brought together researchers in [[topology]], [[computer science]], [[category theory]], and [[mathematical logic]]. The program was organized by [[Steve Awodey]],  [[Thierry Coquand]] and [[Vladimir Voevodsky]].

During the program  [[Peter Aczel]], who was one of the participants, initiated a working group which investigated how to do type theory informally but rigorously, in a style that is analogous to ordinary mathematicians doing set theory. After initial experiments it became clear that this was not only possible but highly beneficial, and that a book (the so-called '''HoTT Book''')&lt;ref name=hott&gt;{{cite book|author=Univalent Foundations Program|title=Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics|year=2013|publisher=Institute for Advanced Study|url=http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/2013/06/20/the-hott-book/ Official announcement of The HoTT Book, by Steve Awodey, 20 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; could and should be written. Many other participants of the project then joined the effort with technical support, writing, proof reading, and offering ideas. Unusually for a mathematics text, it was developed collaboratively and in the open on [[GitHub]], is released under a [[Creative Commons license]] that allows people to [[fork (software development)|fork]] their own version of the book, and is both purchasable in print and downloadable free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D |last=Monroe |title=A New Type of Mathematics? |journal=Comm ACM |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=13–15 |year=2014 |doi=10.1145/2557446 |url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2014/2/171675-a-new-type-of-mathematics/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/06/the_hott_book.html Announcement of The HoTT Book, by Mike Shulman at The n-Category Café, June 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.andrej.com/2013/06/20/the-hott-book/ Announcement of The HoTT Book, by Andrej Bauer, June 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the special year was a catalyst for the development of the entire subject; the HoTT Book was only one, albeit the most visible, result.

=== "Propositions as types" ===
HoTT uses a modified version of the "[[Propositions as types principle|propositions as types]]" interpretation of type theory, according to which types can also represent propositions and terms can then represent proofs.  In HoTT, however, unlike in standard "propositions as types", a special role is played by 'mere propositions' which, roughly speaking, are those types having at most one term, up to [[propositional equality]].  These are more like conventional logical propositions than are general types, in that they are proof-irrelevant.

=== Equality ===
The fundamental concept of homotopy type theory is the [[path (topology)|path]]. In HoTT, the type &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; is the type of all paths from the point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to the point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. (Therefore, a proof that a point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; equals a point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the same thing as a path from the point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to the point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.) For any point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a path of type &lt;math&gt;a = a&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the reflexive property of equality. A path of type &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; can be inverted, forming a path of type &lt;math&gt;b = a&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the symmetric property of equality. Two paths of type &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; resp. &lt;math&gt;b = c&lt;/math&gt; can be concatenated, forming a path of type &lt;math&gt;a = c&lt;/math&gt;; this corresponds to the transitive property of equality.

Most importantly, given a path &lt;math&gt;p:a=b&lt;/math&gt;, and a proof of some property &lt;math&gt;P(a)&lt;/math&gt;, the proof can be "transported" along the path &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to yield a proof of the property &lt;math&gt;P(b)&lt;/math&gt;. (Equivalently stated, an object of type &lt;math&gt;P(a)&lt;/math&gt; can be turned into an object of type &lt;math&gt;P(b)&lt;/math&gt;.) This corresponds to the substitution property of equality. Here, an important difference between HoTT and classical mathematics comes in. In classical mathematics, once the equality of two values &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; has been established, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; may be used interchangeably thereafter, with no regard to any distinction between them. In homotopy type theory, however, there may be multiple different paths &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;, and transporting an object along two different paths will yield two different results. Therefore, in homotopy type theory, when applying the substitution property, it is necessary to state which path is being used.

In general, a "proposition" can have multiple different proofs. (For example, the type of all natural numbers, when considered as a proposition, has every natural number as a proof.) Even if a proposition has only one proof &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, the space of paths &lt;math&gt;a = a&lt;/math&gt; may be non-trivial in some way. A "mere proposition" is any type which either is empty, or contains only one point with a trivial [[Path space (algebraic topology)|path space]].

Note that people write &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;Id_A(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, 
thereby leaving the type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; implicit. 
Do not confuse it with &lt;math&gt;id_A : A\to A&lt;/math&gt;, denoting the identity function on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Type equivalence ===
Two types &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; belonging to some universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; are defined as being ''equivalent'' if there exists an ''equivalence'' between them. An equivalence is a function 
:&lt;math&gt;f:A \to B&lt;/math&gt;
which has both a left inverse and a right inverse, in the sense that for suitably chosen &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, the following types are both inhabited:
:&lt;math&gt;Id_{B\rightarrow B}(f \circ g, id_B),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Id_{A \rarr A}(h \circ f, id_A).&lt;/math&gt; 
i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;f \circ g =_{B\rightarrow B} id_B,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h \circ f =_{A\rightarrow A} id_A.&lt;/math&gt; 
This expresses a general notion of "f has both a left inverse and right inverse", using equality types. Note that the invertibility conditions above are equality types in the function types &lt;math&gt;A\rarr A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\rarr B&lt;/math&gt;.  One generally assumes the function extensionality axiom, which ensures that these are equivalent to the following types that express invertibility using the equality on the domain and codomain &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_{y:B}.\ Id_B((f \circ g)(y), id_B(y)),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_{x:A}.\ Id_A((h \circ f)(x), id_A(x)).&lt;/math&gt; 
i.e. for all &lt;math&gt;x:A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y:B&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f(g(y)) =_B y,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h(f(x)) =_A x.&lt;/math&gt;

The functions of type
:&lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt;
together with a proof that they are equivalences are denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;A \simeq B&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The univalence axiom ===
Having defined functions that are equivalences as above, one can show that there is a canonical way to turn paths to equivalences.
In other words, there is a function of the type
:&lt;math&gt;(A = B) \to (A \simeq B),&lt;/math&gt;
which expresses that types &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; that are equal are, in particular, also equivalent.

The '''univalence axiom''' states that this function is itself an equivalence.&lt;ref name=hott /&gt;{{rp|115}}  Therefore, we have

: &lt;math&gt;(A = B) \simeq (A \simeq B)&lt;/math&gt;

"In other words, identity is equivalent to equivalence. In particular, one may say that 'equivalent
types are identical'."&lt;ref name=hott /&gt;{{rp|4}}

== Applications ==

=== Theorem proving ===
HoTT allows mathematical proofs to be translated into a [[computer programming language]] for computer [[proof assistant]]s much more easily than before. This approach offers the potential for computers to check difficult proofs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/09/new-foundation-mathematics?et_cid=4133336&amp;et_rid=677699018&amp;location=top|title = A new foundation for mathematics|date = 3 September 2014|accessdate = 6 September 2014|website = |publisher = R&amp;D Magazine|last = Meyer|first = Florian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One goal of mathematics is to formulate axioms from which virtually all mathematical theorems can be derived and proven unambiguously. Correct proofs in mathematics must follow the rules of logic. They must be derivable without error from [[axiom]]s and already-proven statements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

HoTT adds the univalence axiom, which relates the equality of logical-mathematical propositions to homotopy theory. An equation such as “a=b” is a mathematical proposition in which two different symbols have the same value. In homotopy type theory, this is taken to mean that the two shapes which represent the values of the symbols are topologically equivalent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These topological equivalence relationships, [[ETH Zürich]] Institute for Theoretical Studies director [[Giovanni Felder]] argues, can be better formulated in homotopy theory because it is more comprehensive: Homotopy theory explains not only why “a equals b” but also how to derive this. In set theory, this information would have to be defined additionally, which makes the translation of mathematical propositions into programming languages more difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Computer programming ===
{{section expand|date=December 2014}}
As of 2015, intense research work was underway to model and formally analyse the computational behavior of the univalence axiom in homotopy type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2676983|title = Higher Inductive Types as Homotopy-Initial Algebras|last = Sojakova|first = Kristina|date = 2015|conference = POPL 2015|doi = 10.1145/2676726.2676983|access-date = |arxiv = 1402.0761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cubical type theory'' is one attempt to give computational content to homotopy type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Cubical Type Theory: a constructive interpretation of the univalence axiom|url=https://hal-iogs.archives-ouvertes.fr/INRIA/hal-01378906v2|last1=Cohen|first1=Cyril|last2=Coquand|first2=Thierry|last3=Huber|first3=Simon|last4=Mörtberg |first4=Anders|conference=TYPES 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is believed that certain objects, such as semi-simplicial types, cannot be constructed without reference to some notion of exact equality. Therefore, various ''two-level type theories'' have been developed which partition their types into fibrant types, which respect paths, and non-fibrant types, which do not. Cartesian Cubical Computational Type Theory is the first two-level type theory which gives a full computational interpretation to homotopy type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Cartesian Cubical Computational Type Theory: Constructive Reasoning with Paths and Equalities| last1=Anguili|first1=Carlo|last2=Favonia|last3=Harper|first3=Robert|conference=Computer Science Logic 2018|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/papers/cartesian/paper.pdf|year=2018|accessdate=26 Aug 2018}} (to appear)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2488">In [[category theory]], a '''Lawvere theory''' (named after [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] [[William Lawvere]]) is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] which can be considered a categorical counterpart of the notion of an [[equational theory]].

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; be a [[skeleton (category_theory)|skeleton]] of the category '''[[FinSet]]''' of [[finite set]]s and [[function (mathematics)|function]]s. Formally, a '''Lawvere theory''' consists of a [[small category]] ''L'' with (strictly [[associativity|associative]]) finite [[product (category theory)|product]]s and a strict identity-on-objects [[functor (category theory)|functor]] &lt;math&gt;I:\aleph_0^\text{op}\rightarrow L&lt;/math&gt; preserving finite products.

A '''model''' of a Lawvere theory in a category ''C'' with finite products is a finite-product preserving functor {{nowrap|''M'' : ''L'' → ''C''}}.  A '''morphism of models'''  {{nowrap|''h'' : ''M'' → ''N''}}  where ''M'' and ''N'' are models of ''L'' is a [[natural transformation]] of functors.

==Category of Lawvere theories==

A '''map''' between Lawvere theories (''L'',''I'') and (''L''′,''I''′) is a finite-product preserving functor which commutes with ''I'' and ''I''′. Such a map is commonly seen as an interpretation of (''L'',''I'') in (''L''′,''I''′).

Lawvere theories together with maps between them form the category '''Law'''.

==Variations&lt;!--'Multisorted Lawvere theory', 'Multityped Lawvere theory', 'Infinitary Lawvere theory', 'Fermat theory', and 'Finite-product theory' redirect here; boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;==
Variations include '''multisorted''' (or '''multityped''') '''Lawvere theory''', '''infinitary Lawvere theory''', '''Fermat theory''' (named [[Fermat's difference quotient]]), and '''finite-product theory'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=Lawvere+theory|title=Lawvere theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1633">In the [[calculus of variations]] the '''Legendre–Clebsch condition''' is a second-order condition which a solution of the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] must satisfy in order to be a maximum (and not a minimum or another kind of extremal).

For the problem of maximizing

:&lt;math&gt;  \int_{a}^{b}  L(t,x,x')\, dt . \,&lt;/math&gt;

the condition is

:&lt;math&gt;0 \ge L_{x' x'}(t,x(t),x'(t)), \, \forall t \in[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalized Legendre-Clebsch==

In [[optimal control]], the situation is more complicated because of the possibility of a [[singular control|singular solution]]'''.  The generalized Legendre–Clebsch condition''',&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Robbins, A generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition for the singular cases of optimal control, IBM Journal of Research and Development, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; also known as convexity,&lt;ref name=Choset2005&gt;{{cite book

 | year = 2005
 | title = Principles of Robot Motion: Theory, Algorithms, and Implementation
 | publisher = The MIT Press
 | isbn = 0-262-03327-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a sufficient condition for local optimality such that when the linear sensitivity of the Hamiltonian to changes in u is zero, i.e.,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial H}{\partial u} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The Hessian of the Hamiltonian is positive definite along the trajectory of the solution:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 H}{\partial u^2} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

In words, the generalized LC condition guarantees that over a singular arc, the Hamiltonian is minimized.

Early [[Islamic law]] placed importance on formulating standards of argument, which gave rise to a "novel approach to [[logic]]"  ({{lang|ar|منطق}} ''manṭiq'' "speech, eloquence") in [[Kalam]] (Islamic scholasticism){{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
However, with the rise of the [[Mu'tazili]] philosophers, who highly valued [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Organon]]'', this approach was  displaced by the older ideas from  [[Hellenistic philosophy]],{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  
The works of [[al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[al-Ghazali]] and other Persian Muslim logicians who often criticized and corrected Aristotelian logic and introduced their own forms of logic, also played a central role in the subsequent development of European logic during the [[Renaissance]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
The use of Aristotelian logic in Islamic theology again began to decline from the 10th century, with the rise of [[Ashʿari theology]] to the intellectual mainstream, which rejects causal reasoning in favour of clerical authority.&lt;ref&gt;[[Muzaffar Iqbal]], ''Science and Islam'', pg. 120. From the Greenwood Guides to Science and Religion Series. [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]]: [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 2007. {{ISBN|9780313335761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]:
{{quote|"For the Islamic philosophers, logic included not only the study of formal patterns of [[inference]] and their validity but also elements of the philosophy of language and even of [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]]. Because of territorial disputes with the Arabic grammarians, Islamic philosophers were very interested in working out the relationship between logic and language, and they devoted much discussion to the question of the subject matter and aims of logic in relation to reasoning and speech. In the area of formal logical analysis, they elaborated upon the theory of [[terminology|terms]], [[Proposition (philosophy)|proposition]]s and [[syllogism]]s as formulated in Aristotle's Categories, De interpretatione and Prior Analytics. In the spirit of Aristotle, they considered the syllogism to be the form to which all rational argumentation could be reduced, and they regarded syllogistic theory as the focal point of logic. Even poetics was considered as a syllogistic art in some fashion by most of the major Islamic Aristotelians."}}

Important developments made by Muslim logicians included the development of "Avicennian logic" as a replacement of Aristotelian logic. [[Avicenna]]'s [[system of logic]] was responsible for the introduction of [[hypothetical syllogism]], [[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[modal logic]] and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]]. Other important developments in early Islamic philosophy include the development of a strict [[scientific citation|science of citation]], the [[isnad]] or "backing", and the development of a [[scientific method|scientific method of open inquiry]]{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} to disprove claims, the [[ijtihad]], which could be generally applied to many types of questions.

The works of Hellenistic-influenced Islamic philosophers were crucial in the [[Recovery of Aristotle|reception of Aristotelianism]] in medieval Europe,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  

==Islamic law and theology==

Early forms of [[Analogy|analogical reasoning]], [[inductive reasoning]] and categorical [[syllogism]] were introduced in [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence), [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) and [[Kalam]] (Islamic theology) from the 7th century with the process of ''[[Qiyas]]'', before the Arabic translations of Aristotle's works. Later during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], there was a logical debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term ''Qiyas'' refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that ''Qiyas'' refers to inductive reasoning, which [[Ibn Hazm]] (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that ''Qiyas'' does not refer to inductive reasoning, but refers to categorical syllogism in a [[Reality|real]] sense and analogical reasoning in a [[metaphor]]ical sense. On the other hand, [[al-Ghazali]] (1058–1111) (and in modern times, [[Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi]]) argued that ''Qiyas'' refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term ''Qiyas'' refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism in a real sense.&lt;ref&gt;Wael B. Hallaq (1993), ''Ibn Taymiyya Against the Greek Logicians'', p. 48. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-824043-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristotelian logic==

The first original Arabic writings on logic were produced by [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus) (805–873), who produced a summary on earlier logic up to his time. The first writings on logic with non-Aristotelian elements was produced by [[al-Farabi]] (Alfarabi) (873–950), who discussed the topics of future [[contingent]]s, the [[number]] and relation of the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]], the relation between [[logic]] and [[grammar]], and non-Aristotelian forms of [[inference]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also credited for categorizing logic into two separate groups, the first being "idea" and the second being "[[logical argument|proof]]".

[[Averroes]] (1126–98) was the last major logician from [[al-Andalus]], who wrote the most elaborate commentaries on Aristotelian logic.

==Avicennian logic==
[[File:Avicenna.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Avicenna from 1271]]

[[Avicenna]] (980-1037) developed his own system of logic known as "Avicennian logic" as an alternative to Aristotelian logic. By the 12th century, Avicennian logic had replaced Aristotelian logic as the dominant system of logic in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;I. M. Bochenski (1961), "On the history of the history of logic", ''A history of formal logic'', p. 4-10. Translated by I. Thomas, Notre Dame, [[Indiana University Press]]. ([[cf.]] [http://www.formalontology.it/islamic-philosophy.htm Ancient Islamic (Arabic and Persian) Logic and Ontology])&lt;/ref&gt;

The first criticisms of Aristotelian logic were written by [[Avicenna]], who produced independent treatises on logic rather than commentaries. He criticized the logical school of Baghdad for their devotion to Aristotle at the time. He investigated the theory of [[definition]] and [[Classification theorems|classification]] and the [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]] of the [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s of categorical [[Proposition (philosophy)|proposition]]s, and developed an original theory on "[[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[Modal logic|modal]]" syllogism. Its premises included [[Grammatical modifier|modifier]]s such as "at all times", "at most times", and "at some time".

While [[Avicenna]] often relied on [[deductive reasoning]] in philosophy, he used a different approach in medicine. Ibn Sina contributed inventively to the development of [[inductive reasoning|inductive logic]], which he used to pioneer the idea of a [[syndrome]]. In his medical writings, Avicenna was the first to describe the [[Mill's Methods|methods of agreement, difference and concomitant variation]] which are critical to inductive logic and the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Hazm]] (994-1064) wrote the ''Scope of Logic'', in which he stressed on the importance of [[sense]] [[perception]] as a source of knowledge.&lt;ref name=Herald&gt;[http://www.islamherald.com/asp/explore/science/science_muslim_scientists.asp Science and Muslim Scientists], Islam Herald.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel) (1058–1111) had an important influence on the use of logic in theology, making use of Avicennian logic in [[Kalam]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Despite the logical sophistication of [[al-Ghazali]], the rise of the [[Ash'ari]] school from the 12th century slowly suffocated original work on logic in much of the Islamic world, though logic continued to be studied in some Islamic regions such as [[History of Iran|Persia]] and the [[Levant]].

[[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (b. 1149) criticised Aristotle's "[[Syllogism|first figure]]" and developed a form of [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]], foreshadowing the system of inductive logic developed by [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873). Systematic refutations of Greek logic were written by the [[Illuminationist philosophy|Illuminationist school]], founded by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] (1155–1191), who developed the idea of "decisive [[Modal logic|necessity]]", an important innovation in the history of logical philosophical speculation.&lt;ref name=Herald/&gt; Another systematic refutation of Greek logic was written by [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (1263&amp;ndash;1328), the ''Ar-Radd 'ala al-Mantiqiyyin'' (''Refutation of Greek Logicians''), where he argued against the usefulness, though not the validity, of the [[syllogism]]&lt;ref&gt;See pp.&amp;nbsp;253&amp;ndash;254 of {{Citation | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-52069-0 | pages = 247&amp;ndash;265 | editors = Peter Adamson and Richard C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8058">'''MathChallengers''' is the former [[Mathcounts]]  in [[British Columbia]]. It is open to all grade 8 and 9 students from [[British Columbia]]. The major sponsors are the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of B.C. (APEGBC), the B.C. Association of Mathematics Teachers (BCAMT), BC Hydro, and IBM Canada.

==Rules==

The Competition consists of 4 stages. Stages 1 and 2 are individual competitions. Stage 3 is a Team competition. Stage 4 is a one-on-one competition between the top 10 individuals who participated in stages 1 and 2.   Math Challengers competitions may consist of the following rounds:

===Stage 1===
Stage 1 consists of one session on a variety of mathematical subjects. Participants will be allowed to work for 40 minutes on 26 questions written on four pages (each correct answer will count as one point). Thus, the maximum number of points available in this stage is: 26.

===Stage 2===
Stage 2 consists of three sessions on a certain mathematical subject. For each of the sessions, participants will be given 12 minutes to work on the 4 questions on that subject. The total number of questions in Stage 1 is 12 and each correct answer will count as two points. Thus, the maximum number of points available in this stage is: 24.

===Stage 3===
Stage 3 is a Team competition and it consists of three sessions on a variety of mathematical subjects. Participants will be allowed to work for 36 minutes on 15 questions written on one page (each correct answer will count as two points). Thus, the maximum number of points available in this stage is 30. Scientific calculators are allowed for this stage of the competition. Graphing calculators and programmable calculators are not allowed at all. Devices with wireless communication capabilities are absolutely not allowed.

===Stage 4===

Stage 4 is a one-to-one buzz-in verbal competition for the top scoring 10 individuals.

There will be a total of 9 match up rounds.

Participants should be provided with ample amounts of scratch paper and pencil for calculating answers.

For each questions the participants will be allowed to work for 45 seconds from the time it appears on the screen.

A participant who wishes to provide an answer must buzz. But, only the first person who buzzes will be called to provide an answer. Any answer without pressing the buzzer will be disqualified. Only ONE answer per participant per question is allowed and he/she must provide the answer in an acceptable format (i.e. simplified to lowest terms) and within 3 seconds after being called upon. The opponent may continue working while an answer is provided and if the answer of the first participant who buzzes is incorrect the opponent may use the remainder of the 45 seconds to buzz and be called to provide an answer. The participant who was called on and provides the correct answer will score one point in the round.

==Scoring and ranking==

===Individual Score===

The maximum possible individual score is 50.

===Team Score===

The maximum possible team score is 80. The team score is calculated in the following way: The average of the top 4 entries per team + the score of the team from the Co-op stage of the competition.

The final Team marks of each of the teams will be calculated by taking into account the marks of the best four individual participants out of the five marks of the individuals of that team.

If a team consists of less than 4 individuals, scores of 0 will be used for any individual missing and will be included in the calculation of the team's average (for example if a team has only 3 participants who scored 50, 40, and 30, and if they scored 18 in the Co-op stage, then their final team score will be (50+40+30+0) /4+18=48.

==Awards and Regionals and Provincial Finals==
The top 3 schools in each of the competitions (only if more than 3 schools participate) will be awarded trophies. The top 3 individuals in each of the competitions (Based on their score before the Face-Off stage) will be awarded trophies. The top 10 individuals (but no more than 5 individuals of the same grade from any one school), or the top 25% of participants, (whichever is less), in each of the competitions will advance to the Face-Off stage and will be awarded medals. All individual final standings are based on the performance in the Blitz and Bull's Eye stages.  All schools that were awarded trophies in any of the Regional pools will be invited to participate in the Provincial finals.

Additional awards or prizes will be awarded to the best performers of the Face-Off stage (Provincial only). The top 3 schools  participating in any of the Regional pools may be invited to participate in the Provincial finals subject to the rules. At the Provincial finals, the top schools and top individuals will be awarded trophies and/or medals. Some of the top individuals in the grade 8 (and grade 9) competition may be invited to participate in a post season competition or event.

Each one has a different user interface. This picture shows clockwise from top left: An [[Arithmometer]], a [[Comptometer]], a Dalton adding machine, a Sundstrand and an [[Odhner Arithmometer]]]]

A '''mechanical calculator''', or '''calculating machine''', is a mechanical device used to perform automatically the basic operations of [[arithmetic]]. Most mechanical calculators were comparable in size to small [[desktop computer]]s and have been rendered obsolete by the advent of the [[electronic calculator]].

Surviving notes from [[Wilhelm Schickard]] in 1623 reveal that he designed and had built the earliest of the modern attempts at mechanizing calculation. His machine was composed of two sets of technologies: first an abacus made of [[Napier's bones]], to simplify multiplications and divisions first described six years earlier in 1617, and for the mechanical part, it had a dialed pedometer to perform additions and subtractions.  A study of the surviving notes shows a machine that would have jammed after a few entries on the same dial,&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], History of Computing Technology, IEEE Computer Society, p. 122 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and that it could be damaged if a carry had to be propagated over a few digits (like adding 1 to 999).&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], History of Computing Technology, IEEE Computer Society, p. 124, 128 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Schickard abandoned his project in 1624 and never mentioned it again until his death 11 years later in 1635.

Two decades after Schickard's supposedly failed attempt, in 1642, [[Blaise Pascal]] decisively solved these particular problems with his invention of the mechanical calculator.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. René Cassin, Pascal tercentenary celebration, London, (1942), [[#NAT_MEP|Magazine Nature]]&lt;/ref&gt; Co-opted into his father's labour as [[tax collector]] in Rouen, Pascal designed the calculator to help in the large amount of tedious arithmetic required;&lt;ref name="INVENT"&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin (1994)]], p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; it was called [[Pascal's Calculator]] or Pascaline.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Pascal's calculator#Competing designs]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arithmometer|Thomas' arithmometer]], the first commercially successful machine, was manufactured two hundred years later in 1851; it was the first mechanical calculator strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. For forty years the arithmometer was the only type of mechanical calculator available for sale.&lt;ref&gt;Beside two arithmometer clone makers from Germany and England, the only other company to offer calculators for sale was Felt &amp; Tarrant from the USA which started selling their comptometer in 1887 but had only sold 100 machines by 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[comptometer]], introduced in 1887, was the first machine to use a keyboard which consisted of columns of nine keys (from 1 to 9) for each digit. The Dalton adding machine, manufactured from 1902, was the first to have a 10 key keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARTIN|Ernst Martin]] p. 133 (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electric motor]]s were used on some mechanical calculators from 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARTIN|Ernst Martin]] p. 23 (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, a comptometer type machine, the [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|Anita mk7]] from Sumlock comptometer Ltd., became the first desktop mechanical calculator to receive an all electronic calculator engine, creating the link in between these two industries and marking the beginning of its decline. The production of mechanical calculators came to a stop in the middle of the 1970s closing an industry that had lasted for 120 years.

[[Charles Babbage]] designed two new kinds of mechanical calculators, which were so big that they required the power of a [[steam engine]] to operate, and that were too sophisticated to be built in his lifetime.  The first one was an ''automatic'' mechanical calculator, his [[difference engine]], which could automatically compute and print mathematical tables. In 1855, [[Per Georg Scheutz|Georg Scheutz]] became the first of a handful of designers to succeed at building a smaller and simpler model of his difference engine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG,Jean Marguin]] p. 171, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The second one was a ''programmable'' mechanical calculator, his [[analytical engine]], which Babbage started to design in 1834; "in less than two years he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern [[computer]]. A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the [[Jacquard loom]]"&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Hyman, ''Charles Babbage, pioneer of the computer'', 1982&lt;/ref&gt; making it infinitely programmable.&lt;ref&gt;"The introduction of punched cards into the new engine was important not only as a more convenient form of control than the drums, or because programs could now be of unlimited extent, and could be stored and repeated without the danger of introducing errors in setting the machine by hand; it was important also because it served to crystallize Babbage's feeling that he had invented something really new, something much more than a sophisticated calculating machine." [[#COLLIER|Bruce Collier]], 1970&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1937, [[Howard Aiken]] convinced [[IBM]] to design and build the [[Harvard Mark I|ASCC/Mark I]], the first machine of its kind, based on the architecture of the analytical engine;&lt;ref&gt;[[#AIKEN|I. Bernard Cohen]], p. 66-67, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; when the machine was finished some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".&lt;ref&gt;[[#ORIGINS|Brian Randell]], p. 187, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient history==

[[Image:Abacus 6.png|thumb|right|A Chinese [[Suanpan]] (the number represented in the picture is 6,302,715,408)]]
{{further|Arithmetic|Abacus}}
{{quote | The desire to economize time and mental effort in arithmetical computations, and to eliminate [[human error|human liability to error]], is probably as old as the science of arithmetic itself. This desire has led to the design and construction of a variety of aids to calculation, beginning with groups of small objects, such as pebbles, first used loosely, later as counters on ruled boards, and later still as beads mounted on wires fixed in a frame, as in the abacus. This instrument was probably invented by the Semitic races and later adopted in India, whence it spread westward throughout Europe and eastward to China and Japan.&lt;br&gt;
After the development of the abacus, no further advances were made until John Napier devised his numbering rods, or [[Napier's Bones]], in 1617. Various forms of the Bones appeared, some approaching the beginning of mechanical computation, but it was not until 1642 that Blaise Pascal gave us the first mechanical calculating machine in the sense that the term is used today.|[[Howard Aiken]], Proposed automatic calculating machine, presented to IBM in 1937}}

{{further|Pascal's calculator#Precursors}}
A short list of other precursors to the mechanical calculator must include a group of mechanical [[analog computer]]s which, once set, are only modified by the continuous and repeated action of their actuators (crank handle, weight, wheel, water...).  Before [[common era]], there are [[odometer]]s and the [[Antikythera mechanism]], an out of place, unique, geared [[astronomical clock]], followed more than a millennium later by early mechanical [[clock]]s, geared [[astrolabes]] and followed in the 15th century by [[pedometer]]s. These machines were all made of [[toothed gear]]s linked by some sort of carry mechanisms.  These machines always produce identical results for identical initial settings unlike a mechanical calculator where all the wheels are independent but are also linked together by the rules of arithmetic.

==The 17th century==

===Overview===
The 17th century marked the beginning of the history of mechanical calculators, as it saw the invention of its first machines, including [[Pascal's calculator]], in 1642.&lt;ref name="INVENT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Please see [[Pascaline#Pascal versus Schickard]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blaise Pascal]] had invented a machine which he presented as being able to perform computations that were previously thought to be only humanly possible,&lt;ref&gt;"The arithmetical machine produces effects which approach nearer to thought than all the actions of animals. But it does nothing which would enable us to attribute will to it, as to the animals.", Pascal, Pensées [//www.bartleby.com/48/1/6.html Bartleby.com, Great Books online, Blaise Pasdcal, Thoughts]&lt;/ref&gt; but he wasn't successful in creating an industry.

{{quote |In a sense, Pascal's invention was premature, in that the mechanical arts in his time were not sufficiently advanced to enable his machine to be made at an economic price, with the accuracy and strength needed for reasonably long use. This difficulty was not overcome until well on into the nineteenth century, by which time also a renewed stimulus to invention was given by the need for many kinds of calculation more intricate than those considered by Pascal.|S. Chapman|Pascal tercentenary celebration, London, (1942)&lt;ref name="tercent"&gt;[[#NAT_CHAP|Magazine Nature]], (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 17th century also saw the invention of some very powerful tools to aid arithmetic calculations like [[Napier's bones]], [[Mathematical table#Tables of logarithms|logarithmic tables]] and the [[slide rule]] which, for their ease of use by scientists in multiplying and dividing, ruled over and impeded the use and development of mechanical calculators&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCRI|Scripta Mathematica]], p. 128 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; until the production release of the [[arithmometer]] in the mid 19th century.

===Invention of the mechanical calculator===
[[Blaise Pascal]] invented a mechanical calculator with a sophisticated carry mechanism in 1642. After three years of effort and 50 prototypes&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/La_Machine_d%E2%80%99arithm%C3%A9tique (fr) La Machine d’arithmétique, Blaise Pascal], Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; he introduced his calculator to the public. He built twenty of these machines in the following ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MOUR|Guy Mourlevat, p. 12 (1988)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This machine could add and subtract two numbers directly and multiply and divide by repetition. Since, unlike Schickard's machine, the Pascaline dials could only rotate in one direction zeroing it after each calculation required the operator to dial in all 9s and then ([[Pascal's calculator#Resetting the machine|method of {{nowrap|re-zeroing}}]]) propagate a carry right through the machine.&lt;ref name="CR_RESET"&gt;[[#COURRIER|Courrier du CIBP]], N°8, p. 9, (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that the carry mechanism would have proved itself in practice many times over. This is a testament to the quality of the Pascaline because none of the 17th and 18th century criticisms of the machine mentioned a problem with the carry mechanism and yet it was fully tested on all the machines, by their resets, all the time.&lt;ref name="NO_BLOC"&gt;"...''et si blocage il y avait, la machine était pratiquement inutilisable, ce qui ne fut jamais signalé dans les textes du XVIIIe siecle parmi ses défaults''" [[#MOUR|Guy Mourlevat]], p. 30 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote | Pascal's invention of the calculating machine, just three hundred years ago, was made while he was a youth of nineteen. He was spurred to it by seeing the burden of arithmetical labor involved in his father's official work as supervisor of taxes at Rouen. He conceived the idea of doing the work mechanically, and developed a design appropriate for this purpose; showing herein the same combination of pure science and mechanical genius that characterized his whole life. But it was one thing to conceive and design the machine, and another to get it made and put into use. Here were needed those practical gifts that he displayed later in his inventions...|S. Chapman|Pascal tercentenary celebration, London, (1942)&lt;ref name="tercent"/&gt;}}

In 1672, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] started working on adding direct multiplication to what he understood was the working of Pascal's calculator. However, it is doubtful that he had ever fully seen the mechanism and the method could not have worked because of the lack of reversible rotation in the mechanism. Accordingly,  he eventually designed an entirely new machine called the [[Stepped Reckoner]]; it used his [[Leibniz wheel]]s, was the first two-motion calculator, the first to use cursors (creating a memory of the first operand) and the first to have a movable carriage. Leibniz built two Stepped Reckoners, one in 1694 and one in 1706.&lt;ref name="LEIB"&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin, p. 64-65 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Only the machine built in 1694 is known to exist, it was rediscovered at the end of the 19th century having been forgotten in an attic in the [[University of Göttingen]].&lt;ref name="LEIB"/&gt;
{{quote |In 1893, the German calculating machine inventor Arthur Burkhardt was asked to put Leibniz machine in operating condition if possible. His report was favorable except for the sequence in the carry.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SCRI|Scripta Mathematica]], p. 149 (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Leibniz had invented his namesake wheel and the principle of a two motion calculator, but after forty years of development he wasn't able to produce a machine that was fully operational&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morar|first=Florin-Stefan|date=March 2015|title=Reinventing machines: the transmission history of the Leibniz calculator|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-for-the-history-of-science/article/reinventing-machines-the-transmission-history-of-the-leibniz-calculator/0EFE30C7B3975C7ADF10627D20CC3F07|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|volume=48|issue=1|pages=123–146|doi=10.1017/S0007087414000429|issn=0007-0874}}&lt;/ref&gt;; this makes Pascal's calculator the only working mechanical calculator in the 17th century. Leibniz was also the first person to describe a [[pinwheel calculator]].&lt;ref name="PINWHEEL"&gt;[[#SMITH|David Smith]], p. 173-181 (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; He once said "It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in {{harvnb|Smith|1929|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other calculating machines===
Schickard, Pascal and Leibniz were inevitably inspired by the role of clockwork which was highly celebrated in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.TheModernEpochAndTheEmergenceOfTheModernCalculator#schickard http://things-that-count.net]&lt;/ref&gt; However, simple minded application of interlinked gears was insufficient for any of their purposes.  Schickard introduced the use of a single toothed "mutilated gear" to enable the carry to take place.  Pascal improved on that with his famous weighted sautoir.  Leibniz went even further in relation to the ability to use a moveable carriage to perform multiplication more efficiently, albeit at the expense of a fully working carry mechanism.

{{quote|...I devised a third which works by springs and which has a very simple design. This is the one, as I have already stated, that I used many times, hidden in the plain sight of an infinity of persons and which is still in operating order. Nevertheless, while always improving on it, I found reasons to change its design...|Pascal|Advertisement Necessary to those who have curiosity to see the Arithmetic Machine, and to operate it (1645)&lt;ref&gt;Translated from "j'en composai une troisième qui va par ressorts et qui est très simple en sa construction. C'est celle de laquelle, comme j'ai déjà dit, je me suis servi plusieurs fois, au vu et su d'une infinité de personnes, et qui est encore en état de servir autant que jamais. Toutefois, en la perfectionnant toujours, je trouvai des raisons de la changer" [[s:fr:La Machine d’arithmétique#Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir|Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir]] Wikisource: La Machine d’arithmétique, Blaise Pascal&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|When, several years ago, I saw for the first time an instrument which, when carried, automatically records the numbers of steps by a pedestrian, it occurred to me at once that the entire arithmetic could be subjected to a similar kind of machinery so that not only counting but also addition and subtraction, multiplication and division could be accomplished by a suitably arranged machine easily, promptly, and with sure results|Leibniz|on his calculating machine (1685)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[#SMITH|David Smith]], p. 173, (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The principle of the clock (input wheels and display wheels added to a clock like mechanism) for a direct entry calculating machine couldn't be implemented to create a fully effective calculating machine without additional innovation with the technological capabilities of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p. 124, 128 (1997) for Schikard's machine and the fact that the machines built by Burattini, Morland and Grillet were calculating clocks without a completely effective carry mechanism.&lt;/ref&gt; because their gears would jam when a carry had to be moved several places along the accumulator. The only 17th century calculating clocks that have survived to this day do not have a machine wide carry mechanism and therefore cannot be called fully effective mechanical calculators. A much more successful calculating clock was built by the Italian [[Giovanni Poleni]] in the 18th century and was a two-motion calculating clock (the numbers are inscribed first and then they are processed).

* In 1623, [[Wilhelm Schickard]], a German professor of Hebrew and Astronomy, designed a calculating clock which he drew on two letters that he wrote to [[Johannes Kepler]]. The first machine to be built by a professional was destroyed during its construction and Schickard abandoned his project in 1624. These drawings had appeared in various publications over the centuries, starting in 1718 with a book of Kepler's letters by [[Michael Gottlieb Hansch|Michael Hansch]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://history-computer.com/MechanicalCalculators/Pioneers/Schickard.html History of computer] (retrieved on 01/02/2012)&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1957 it was presented for the first time as a long lost mechanical calculator by Dr. Franz Hammer. The building of the first replica in the 1960s showed that Schickard's machine had an unfinished design and therefore wheels and springs were added to make it work.&lt;ref name="UNFINISHED"&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p. 122 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these replicas showed that the single tooth wheel, when used within a calculating clock, was an inadequate carry mechanism.&lt;ref name=NOTDO&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p. 124, 128 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Pascal's Calculator#Pascal versus Schickard|see Pascal versus Schickard]]).  This did not mean that such a machine could not be used in practice, but the operator when faced with the mechanism resisting rotation, in the unusual circumstances of a carry being required beyond (say) 3 dials, would need to "help" the subsequent carry to propagate.
* Around 1643, a French clockmaker from Rouen, after hearing of Pascal's work, built what he claimed to be a calculating clock of his own design. Pascal fired all his employees and stopped developing his calculator as soon as he heard of the news.&lt;ref&gt;"The appearance of this small ''avorton'' disturbed me to the utmost and it dampened the enthusiasm with which I was developing my calculator so much that I immediately let go all of my employees..." translated from the French: "L'aspect de ce petit avorton me déplut au dernier point et refroidit tellement l'ardeur avec laquelle je faisais lors travailler à l'accomplissement de mon modèle qu'à l'instant même je donnai congé à tous les ouvriers..."&lt;/ref&gt;  It is only after being assured that his invention would be protected by a royal privilege that he restarted his activity.&lt;ref&gt;"But, later on, Lord Chancellor of France [...] granted me a royal privilege which is not usual, and which will suffocate before their birth all these illegitimate ''avortons'' which, by the way, could only be born of the legitimate and necessary alliance of theory and art." translated from the French: "Mais, quelque temps après, Monseigneur le Chancelier [...] par la grâce qu'il me fit de m'accorder un privilège qui n'est pas ordinaire, et qui étouffe avant leur naissance tous ces avortons illégitimes qui pourraient être engendrés d'ailleurs que de la légitime et nécessaire alliance de la théorie avec l'art"&lt;/ref&gt;  A careful examination of this calculating clock showed that it didn't work properly and Pascal called it an ''avorton'' (aborted fetus).&lt;ref&gt;"...a useless piece, perfectly clean, polished and well filed on the outside but so imperfect inside that it is of no use whatsoever." translated from the French: "...qu'une pièce inutile, propre véritablement, polie et très bien limée par le dehors, mais tellement imparfaite au dedans qu'elle n'est d'aucun usage"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All the quotes in this paragraph are found in (fr) [[s:fr:La Machine d’arithmétique#Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir|Wikisource: Avis nécessaire à ceux qui auront curiosité de voir la Machine d'Arithmétique et de s'en servir]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1659, the Italian [[Tito Livio Burattini]] built a machine with nine independent wheels, each one of these wheels was paired with a smaller carry wheel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/mediciscienze/emed.asp?c=35423 Picture of Burattini's machine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609022832/http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/mediciscienze/emed.asp?c=35423 |date=2010-06-09 }} Florence, Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza, inv. 3179 (accessed on January, 09 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of an operation the user had to either manually add each carry to the next digit or mentally add these numbers to create the final result.
* In 1666, [[Samuel Morland]] invented a machine designed to add sums of money,&lt;ref name="Chronicle, p. 12"&gt;[[#CHRONICLE|A calculator Chronicle, ''300 years of counting and reckoning tools'']], p. 12, IBM&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not a true adding machine since the carry was added to a small carry wheel situated above each digit and not directly to the next digit. It was very similar to Burattini's machine. Morland created also a multiplying machines with interchangeable disks based on Napier's bones.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WILLIAMS|Michael Williams]], p.140 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/mediciscienze/emed.asp?c=35418 Picture of Morland multiplying machine] Florence, Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza, inv. 679 (retrieved on January, 09 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  Taken together these two machines provided a capacity similar to that of the invention of Schickard, although it is doubtful that Morland ever encountered Schickard's calculating clock.
* In 1673, the French clockmaker [[René Grillet de Roven|René Grillet]] described in ''Curiositez mathématiques de l'invention du Sr Grillet, horlogeur à Paris'' a calculating machine that would be more compact than Pascal's calculator and reversible for subtraction. The only two Grillet machines known&lt;ref&gt;They belong to the [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]] in Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; have no carry mechanism, displaying three lines of nine independent dials they also have nine rotating napier's rod for multiplication and division. Contrary to Grillet's claim, it was not a mechanical calculator after all.&lt;ref&gt;"Grillet's machine doesn't even deserve the name of machine" translated from the French "La machine de Grillet ne mérite donc pas même le nom de machine", [[#MARG|Jean Marguin, p.76 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 18th century==

===Overview===
{{further|Pinwheel calculator|Leibniz wheel}}
The 18th century saw the first mechanical calculator that could perform a multiplication automatically; designed and built by [[Giovanni Poleni]] in 1709 and made of wood, it was the first successful calculating clock. For all the machines built in this century, division still required the operator to decide when to stop a repeated subtraction at each index, and therefore these machines were only providing a help in dividing, like an [[abacus]]. Both pinwheel calculators and Leibniz wheel calculators were built with a few unsuccessful attempts at their commercialization.

===Prototypes and limited runs===
* In 1709, the Italian [[Giovanni Poleni]] was the first to build a calculator that could multiply automatically.  It used a pinwheel design, was the first operational ''calculating clock'' and was made of wood;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museoscienza.org/approfondimenti/documenti/macchina_poleni/replica.asp Copy of Poleni's machine] (it) Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia Leonardo Da Vinci. Retrieved 2010-10-04&lt;/ref&gt; he destroyed it after hearing that Antonius Braun had received 10,000 [[Rhenish guilder|Gulden]]s for dedicating a pinwheel machine of his own design to the emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin, p. 93-94 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1725, the [[French Academy of Sciences]] certified a calculating machine derived from Pascal's calculator designed by Lépine, a French craftsman. The machine was a bridge in between Pascal's calculator and a calculating clock. The carry transmissions were performed simultaneously, like in a calculating clock, and therefore "the machine must have jammed beyond a few simultaneous carry transmissions".&lt;ref&gt;translated from the French: "De plus le report ne s'effectuant pas en cascade, la machine devait se bloquer au-delà de quelques reports simultanés", [[#MARG|Jean Marguin]], p.78 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1727, a German, [[Antonius Braun]], presented the first fully functional four operations machine to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] in [[Vienna]]. It was cylindrical in shape and was made of steel, silver and brass; it was finely decorated and looked like a renaissance table clock. His dedication to the emperor engraved on the top of the machine also reads "..to make easy to ignorant people, addition, subtraction, multiplication and even division".&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG|Jean Marguin, p.94-96 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1730, the French Academy of Sciences certified three machines designed by [[Hillerin de Boistissandeau]]. The first one used a single tooth carry mechanism which, according to Boistissandeau, wouldn't work properly if a carry had to be moved more than two places; the two other machines used springs that were gradually armed until they released their energy when a carry had to be moved forward. It was similar to Pascal's calculator but instead of using the energy of gravity Boistissandeau used the energy stored into the springs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARG, Jean Marguin]], pages 80-81 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1770, [[Philipp Matthäus Hahn]], a German pastor, built two circular calculating machines based on Leibniz' cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARGIN|Marguin, p.83 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/attic/attic_137.html Picture of Hahn's Calculator] IBM Collection of mechanical calculators&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. C. Schuster]], Hahn's brother in law, built a few machines of Hahn's design into the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#MARGIN|Jean Marguin, pages 84-86 (1994)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1775, [[Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] of the [[United Kingdom]] designed a pinwheel machine. It was set in a rectangular box with a handle on the side. He also designed a machine using [[Leibniz wheel]]s in 1777.&lt;ref&gt;[[#FELT|Door E. Felt, p.15-16 (1916)]]&lt;/ref&gt; "In 1777 Stanhope produced the ''Logic Demonstrator,'' a machine designed to solve problems in formal logic. This device marked the beginning of a new approach to the solution of logical problems by mechanical methods."&lt;ref name="Chronicle, p. 12"/&gt;
* In 1784, [[J. H. Müller|Johann-Helfrich Müller]] built a machine very similar to Hahn's machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnum.cnam.fr/CGI/fpage.cgi?8KU54-2.5/253/150/369/363/369|title=CNUM - 8KU54-2.5 : p.249 - im.253|website=cnum.cnam.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 19th century==

===Overview===
{{anchor|TotalMachinesBuilt}}
[[Luigi Torchi (inventor)| Luigi Torchi]] invented the first direct multiplication machine in [[1834]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-computer.com/MechanicalCalculators/19thCentury/Torchi.html|title=History of Computers and Computing, Mechanical calculators, 19th century, Luiggi Torchi|website=history-computer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the second key-driven machine in the world, following that of James White ([[1822]])&lt;ref name="Roegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7763737|title=IEEE Xplore Full-Text PDF:|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The mechanical calculator industry started in 1851  [[Thomas de Colmar]] released his simplified [[Arithmometer|Arithmomètre]] which was the first machine that could be used daily in an office environment.

For 40 years,&lt;ref&gt;This is one third of the 120 years that this industry lasted&lt;/ref&gt; the arithmometer was the only mechanical calculator available for sale and was sold all over the world. By then, in 1890, about 2,500 arithmometers had been sold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSeriePayen.html|title=www.arithmometre.org|website=www.arithmometre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus a few hundreds more from two licensed arithmometer clone makers (Burkhardt, Germany, 1878 and Layton, UK, 1883). Felt and Tarrant, the only other competitor in true commercial production, had sold 100 comptometers in three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Felt|first=Dorr E.|title=Mechanical arithmetic, or The history of the counting machine|publisher=Washington Institute|location=Chicago|page=4|year=1916|url=https://archive.org/details/mechanicalarithm00feltrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century also saw the designs of Charles Babbage calculating machines, first with his [[difference engine]], started in 1822, which was the first automatic calculator since it continuously used the results of the previous operation for the next one, and second with his [[analytical engine]], which was the first programmable calculator, using Jacquard's cards to read program and data, that he started in 1834, and which gave the blueprint of the [[mainframe computers]] built in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BABBAGE&gt;"The calculating engines of English mathematician Charles Babbage (1791-1871) are among the most celebrated icons in the prehistory of computing. Babbage’s Difference Engine No.1 was the first successful automatic calculator and remains one of the finest examples of precision engineering of the time. Babbage is sometimes referred to as "father of computing." The International Charles Babbage Society (later the Charles Babbage Institute) took his name to honor his intellectual contributions and their relation to modern computers."

===Desktop calculators produced===
[[Image:Close-up of the front panel of a Thomas Arithmometer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Front panel of a Thomas Arithmometer with its movable result carriage extended]]
* In 1851, [[Thomas de Colmar]] simplified his [[arithmometer]] by removing the one digit multiplier/divider. This made it a simple adding machine, but thanks to its moving carriage used as an indexed accumulator, it still allowed for easy multiplication and division under operator control. The arithmometer was now adapted to the manufacturing capabilities of the time; Thomas could therefore manufacture consistently a sturdy and reliable machine.&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah G., ''The Universal History of Numbers'', vol 3, page 127, The Harvill Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Manuals were printed and each machine was given a serial number. Its commercialization launched the mechanical calculator industry.&lt;ref name="Chase"&gt;Chase G.C.: ''History of Mechanical Computing Machinery'', Vol. 2, Number 3, July 1980, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;  Banks, insurance companies, government offices started to use the arithmometer in their day-to-day operations, slowly bringing mechanical desktop calculators into the office.
* In 1878 Burkhardt, of Germany, was the first to manufacture a clone of Thomas' arithmometer. Until then Thomas de Colmar had been the only manufacturer of desktop mechanical calculators in the world and he had manufactured about 1,500 machines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSerieEnglish.html Serial numbers and Years of manufacturing] www.arithmometre.org, Valéry Monnier&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually twenty European companies will manufacture clones of thomas' arithmometer until WWII.
* [[Dorr E. Felt]], in the U.S., patented the [[Comptometer]] in 1886. It was the first successful key-driven adding and calculating machine. ["Key-driven" refers to the fact that just pressing the keys causes the result to be calculated, no separate lever or crank has to be operated. Other machines are sometimes called "key-set".] In 1887, he joined with Robert Tarrant to form the Felt &amp; Tarrant Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref&gt;J.A.V. Turck, ''Origin of modern calculating machines'', The Western Society of Engineers, 1921, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;  The comptometer-type calculator was the first machine to receive an all-electronic calculator engine in 1961 (the [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA mark VII]] released by Sumlock comptometer of the UK).
* In 1890 [[Viligodt Teofil Odner|W. T. Odhner]] got the rights to manufacture his calculator back from ''Königsberger &amp; C'', which had held them since it was first patented in 1878, but had not really produced anything. Odhner used his [[Saint Petersburg]] workshop to manufacture his calculator and he built and sold 500 machines in 1890. This manufacturing operation shut down definitively in 1918 with 23,000 machines produced. The [[Odhner Arithmometer]] was a redesigned version of the Arithmometer of Thomas de Colmar with a pinwheel engine, which made it cheaper to manufacture and gave it a smaller footprint while keeping the advantage of having the same user interface.&lt;ref name="Trogemann"&gt;[[#TROG|G. Trogemann]], pages: 39-45&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1892 Odhner sold the Berlin branch of his factory, which he had opened a year earlier, to ''Grimme, Natalis &amp; Co.''. They moved the factory to Braunschweig and sold their machines under the brand name of Brunsviga (Brunsviga is the Latin name of the town of Braunschweig).&lt;ref&gt;David J. Shaw: ''The Cathedral Libraries Catalogue'', The British Library and the Bibliographical Society, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first of many companies which would sell and manufacture clones of Odhner's machine all over the world; eventually millions were sold well into the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Trogemann"/&gt;
* In 1892, [[William Seward Burroughs I|William S. Burroughs]] began commercial manufacture of his printing adding calculator&lt;ref&gt;J.A.V. Turck, ''Origin of modern calculating machines'', The Western Society of Engineers, 1921, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burroughs Corporation]] became one of the leading companies in the accounting machine and [[computer]] businesses.
* [[The Millionaire Calculator|The "Millionaire"]] calculator was introduced in 1893. It allowed direct multiplication by any digit - "one turn of the crank for each figure in the multiplier". It contained a mechanical product lookup table, providing units and tens digits by differing lengths of posts.  [http://www.johnwolff.id.au/calculators/Tech/Millionaire/Intro.htm] Another direct multiplier was part of the Moon-Hopkins billing machine; that company was acquired by Burroughs in the early 20th century.

* In 1822, [[Charles Babbage]] presented a small cogwheel assembly that demonstrated the operation of his [[difference engine]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#WEB|James Essinger]], p.76 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; a mechanical calculator which would be capable of holding and manipulating seven numbers of 31 decimal digits each. It was the first time that a calculating machine could work automatically using as input results from its previous operations.&lt;ref name=BABBAGE/&gt;  It was the first calculating machine to use a printer. The development of this machine, later called "Difference Engine No. 1," stopped around 1834.&lt;ref&gt;"The better part of my live has now been spent on that machine, and no progress whatever having been made since 1834...", Charles Babbage, quoted in [[#GENIUS|Irascible Genius]], 1964, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1847, Babbage began work on an improved difference engine design—his "Difference Engine No. 2."  None of these designs were completely built by Babbage. In 1991 the [[Science Museum (London)|London Science Museum]] followed Babbage's plans to build a working Difference Engine No. 2 using the technology and materials available in the 19th century.
* In 1855, [[Per Georg Scheutz]] completed a working difference engine based on Babbage's design. The machine was the size of a piano, and was demonstrated at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]] in [[Paris]] in 1855. It was used to create tables of [[logarithm]]s.
* In 1875, [[Martin Wiberg]] re-designed the Babbage/Scheutz difference engine and built a version that was the size of a sewing machine.

=== Programmable mechanical calculators ===
[[File:Analytical Engine (2290032530).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.6|Minimal but working demonstration part of the ''mill'' from the [[Analytical engine]], finished by Babbage's son around 1906]]
* In 1834, Babbage started to design his [[analytical engine]], which will become the undisputed ancestor of the modern [[mainframe computer]]&lt;ref&gt;"It is reasonable to inquire, therefore, whether it is possible to devise a machine which will do for mathematical computation what the [[automatic lathe]] has done for engineering. The first suggestion that such a machine could be made came more than a hundred years ago from the mathematician Charles Babbage. Babbage's ideas have only been properly appreciated in the last ten years, but we now realize that he understood clearly all the fundamental principles which are embodied in modern digital computers" [[#FASTER|B. V. Bowden]], 1953, pp. 6,7&lt;/ref&gt; with two separate input streams for data and program (a primitive [[Harvard architecture]]), printers for outputting results (three different kind), processing unit (mill), memory (store) and the first ever set of programming instructions. In the proposal that [[Howard Aiken]] gave [[IBM]] in 1937 while requesting funding for the [[Harvard Mark I]] which became IBM's entry machine in the computer industry, we can read: "Few calculating machines have been designed strictly for application to scientific investigations, the notable exceptions being those of Charles Babbage and others who followed him. In 1812 Babbage conceived the idea of a calculating machine of a higher type than those previously constructed to be used for calculating and printing tables of mathematical functions. ....After abandoning the ''difference engine'', Babbage devoted his energy to the design and construction of an ''analytical engine'' of far higher powers than the ''difference engine''..."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Aiken, 1937, reprinted in [[#ORIGINS|The origins of Digital computers, Selected Papers]], Edited by [[Brian Randell]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the analytical engine, [[Ada Lovelace]] wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the [[Bernoulli numbers]].  This is considered the first computer program.
* From 1872 until 1910, [[Henry Babbage]] worked intermittently on creating the mill, the "central processing unit" of his father's machine.  After a few setbacks, he gave in 1906 a successful demonstration of the mill which printed the first 44 multiples of pi with 29 places of figures.

=== Cash registers ===
{{further|Cash registers}}
The cash register, invented by the American saloonkeeper [[James Ritty]] in 1879, addressed the old problems of disorganization and dishonesty in business transactions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncr.org.uk/page106.html NCR Retrospective website] accessed October, 02 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a pure adding machine coupled with a [[printer (computing)|printer]], a bell and a two-sided display that showed the paying party and the store owner, if he wanted to, the amount of money exchanged for the current transaction.

The cash register was easy to use and, unlike genuine mechanical calculators, was needed and quickly adopted by a great number of businesses.  "Eighty four companies sold cash registers between 1888 and 1895, only three survived for any length of time".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cashregistersonline.com/history.asp History of the cash register] retrieved October, 05 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, 6 years after [[John Henry Patterson (NCR owner)|John Patterson]] started [[NCR Corporation]], 20,000 machines had been sold by his company alone against a total of roughly 3,500 for all genuine calculators combined.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TotalMachinesBuilt|See the number of machines built in 1890]] in this paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, NCR had built 200,000 cash registers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasscashregister.net/learn_more/articles/how_to_date_your_national_or_ncr_cash_register/ Dick and Joan's antique] accessed October, 02 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and there were more companies manufacturing them, compared to the "Thomas/Payen" arithmometer company that had just sold around 3,300&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSeriePayen.html List of serial numbers by dates] arithmometre.org retrieved October 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and Burroughs had only sold 1,400 machines.&lt;ref&gt;Before the computer, James W. Cortada, p.34 {{ISBN|0-691-04807-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prototypes and limited runs===
[[File:Arithmometer - Detail of Multiplier pre 1851.jpg|right|thumb|center|&lt;div align="center"&gt;The arithmometers built from 1820 to 1851 had a one digit multiplier/divider cursor (ivory top) is on the left. Only prototypes of these machines were built.&lt;/div&gt;]]
* In 1820, [[Thomas de Colmar]] patented the Arithmometer. It was a true four operation machine with a one digit multiplier/divider ([[The Millionaire Calculator|the millionaire calculator]] released 70 years later had a similar user interface&lt;ref&gt;A notable difference was that the Millionaire calculator used an internal mechanical product lookup table versus a repeated addition or subtraction ''until a counter was decreased down to zero and stopped the machine'' for the arithmometer&lt;/ref&gt;). He spent the next 30 years and 300,000 Francs developing his machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arithmometre.org/Bibliotheque/BibNumerique/AmiDesSciences1856/AmidesSciences1856.pdf L'ami des Sciences 1856, p. 301] www.arithmometre.org (page retrieved on 09/22/2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  This design was replaced in 1851 by the simplified arithmometer which was only an adding machine.
* From 1840, Didier Roth patented and built a few calculating machines, one of which was a direct descendant of [[Pascal's calculator]].
* In 1842, Timoleon Maurel invented the [[Arithmaurel]], based on the Arithmometer, which could multiply two numbers by simply entering their values into the machine.
* In 1845, [[Izrael Abraham Staffel]] first exhibited a machine that was able to add, subtract, divide, multiply and obtain a square root.
* Around 1854, [[Andre-Michel Guerry]] invented the Ordonnateur Statistique, a cylindrical device designed to aid in summarizing the relations among data on moral variables (crime, suicide, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Larousse, P. (1886), ''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIX siècle'', Paris, entry for A-M Guerry&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1872, [[Frank Stephen Baldwin|Frank S. Baldwin]] in the U.S. invented a [[pinwheel calculator]].
* In 1877 [[George B. Grant]] of Boston, MA, began producing the Grant mechanical calculating machine capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CYBERSPACE|Hook &amp; Norman]] p.252 (2001): "Grant developed two models of his calculating machine: a ''Barrel model'', which he exhibited at the Centennial Exposition along with his difference engine; and a ''Rack and Pinion'' model, of which he was able to sell 125 examples.  Although Grant never made much money from his calculating machines, his experiences in designing and constructing them led him to establish the highly successful ''Grant Gear Works'', which helped to pioneer the gear-cutting industry in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; The machine measured 13x5x7 inches and contained eighty working pieces made of brass and tempered steel. It was first introduced to the public at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;''"Improved Calculating Machine"'', "Scientific American" Vol. XXXVI, No. 19, May 12, 1877 p.294 New York: Munn &amp;Company (Publisher)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanical calculators reach their zenith ===
Two different classes of mechanisms had become established by this time, reciprocating and rotary. The former type of mechanism was operated typically by a limited-travel hand crank; some internal detailed operations took place on the pull, and others on the release part of a complete cycle. The illustrated 1914 machine is this type; the crank is vertical, on its right side. Later on, some of these mechanisms were operated by electric motors and reduction gearing that operated a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and [[connecting rod]] to convert rotary motion to reciprocating.

The latter, type, rotary, had at least one main shaft that made one [or more] continuous revolution[s], one addition or subtraction per turn. Numerous designs, notably European calculators, had handcranks, and locks to ensure that the cranks were returned to exact positions once a turn was complete.

[[Image:Mechanical-Calculator.png|thumb|right|Mechanical calculator from 1914]]
The first half of the 20th century saw the gradual development of the mechanical calculator mechanism.

The Dalton adding-listing [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Addizionatrice_Dalton.jpg machine] introduced in 1902 was the first of its type to use only ten keys, and became the first of many different models of "10-key add-listers" manufactured by many companies.
[[File:Modern Addiator.jpg|thumb|left|100px|An [[Addiator]] can be used for addition and subtraction.]]
In 1948 the cylindrical [[Curta]] calculator, which was compact enough to be held in one hand, was introduced after being developed by [[Curt Herzstark]] in 1938. This was an extreme development of the stepped-gear calculating mechanism. It subtracted by adding complements; between the teeth for addition were teeth for subtraction.

From the early 1900s through the 1960s, mechanical calculators dominated the desktop computing market. Major suppliers in the USA included [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]], [[Monroe Calculator Company|Monroe]], and [[Marchant Calculator|SCM/Marchant]]. These devices were motor-driven, and had movable carriages where results of calculations were displayed by dials. Nearly all keyboards were ''full'' — each digit that could be entered had its own column of nine keys, 1..9, plus a column-clear key, permitting entry of several digits at once. (See the illustration below of a Marchant Figurematic.) One could call this parallel entry, by way of contrast with ten-key serial entry that was commonplace in mechanical adding machines, and is now universal in electronic calculators. (Nearly all Friden calculators, as well as some rotary (German) Diehls had a ten-key auxiliary keyboard for entering the multiplier when doing multiplication.) Full keyboards generally had ten columns, although some lower-cost machines had eight. Most machines made by the three companies mentioned did not print their results, although other companies, such as [[Olivetti]], did make printing calculators.

In these machines, [[addition]] and [[subtraction]] were performed in a single operation, as on a conventional adding machine, but [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] were accomplished by repeated mechanical additions and subtractions. [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] made a calculator that also provided [[square root]]s, basically by doing division, but with added mechanism that automatically incremented the number in the keyboard in a systematic fashion. The last of the mechanical calculators were likely to have short-cut multiplication, and some ten-key, serial-entry types had decimal-point keys. However, decimal-point keys required significant internal added complexity, and were offered only in the last designs to be made. Handheld mechanical calculators such as the 1948 [[Curta]] continued to be used until they were displaced by electronic calculators in the 1970s.

Typical European four-operation machines use the Odhner mechanism, or variations of it. This kind of machine included the ''Original Odhner'', Brunsviga and several following imitators, starting from Triumphator, Thales, Walther, Facit up to Toshiba. Although most of these were operated by handcranks, there were motor-driven versions. Hamann calculators externally resembled pinwheel machines, but the setting lever positioned a cam that disengaged a drive pawl when the dial had moved far enough.

Although Dalton introduced in 1902 first ten-key printing ''adding'' (two operations, the other being subtraction) machine, these feature were not present in ''computing'' (four operations) machines for many decades. Facit-T (1932) was the first 10-key computing machine sold in large numbers. [[Olivetti]] Divisumma-14 (1948) was the first computing machine with both printer and a 10-key keyboard.

Full-keyboard machines, including motor-driven ones, were also built until the 1960s. Among the major manufacturers were Mercedes-Euklid, Archimedes, and MADAS in Europe; &lt;!--Need more makers! --&gt;in the USA, Friden, Marchant, and Monroe were the principal makers of rotary calculators with carriages. Reciprocating calculators (most of which were adding machines, many with integral printers) were made by Remington Rand and Burroughs, among others. All of these were key-set. Felt &amp; Tarrant made Comptometers, as well as Victor, which were key-driven.

The basic mechanism of the Friden and Monroe was a modified Leibniz wheel (better known, perhaps informally, in the USA as a "stepped drum" or "stepped reckoner"). The Friden had an elementary reversing drive between the body of the machine and the accumulator dials, so its main shaft always rotated in the same direction. The Swiss MADAS was similar. The Monroe, however, reversed direction of its main shaft to subtract.

The earliest Marchants were pinwheel machines, but most of them were remarkably-sophisticated rotary types. They ran at 1,300 addition cycles per minute if the [+] bar is held down. Others were limited to 600 cycles per minute, because their accumulator dials started and stopped for every cycle; Marchant dials moved at a steady and proportional speed for continuing cycles. Most Marchants had a row of nine keys on the extreme right, as shown in the photo of the Figurematic. These simply made the machine add for the number of cycles corresponding to the number on the key, and then shifted the carriage one place. Even nine add cycles took only a short time.

In a Marchant, near the beginning of a cycle, the accumulator dials moved downward "into the dip", away from the openings in the cover. They engaged drive gears in the body of the machine, which rotated them at speeds proportional to the digit being fed to them, with added movement (reduced 10:1) from carries created by dials to their right. At the completion of the cycle, the dials would be misaligned like the pointers in a traditional watt-hour meter. However, as they came up out of the dip, a constant-lead disc cam realigned them by way of a (limited-travel) spur-gear differential. As well, carries for lower orders were added in by another, planetary differential. (The machine shown has 39 differentials in its (20-digit) accumulator!)

In any mechanical calculator, in effect, a gear, sector, or some similar device moves the accumulator by the number of gear teeth that corresponds to the digit being added or subtracted – three teeth changes the position by a count of three. The great majority of basic calculator mechanisms move the accumulator by starting, then moving at a constant speed, and stopping. In particular, stopping is critical, because to obtain fast operation, the accumulator needs to move quickly. Variants of Geneva drives typically block overshoot (which, of course, would create wrong results).

However, two different basic mechanisms, the Mercedes-Euklid and the Marchant, move the dials at speeds corresponding to the digit being added or subtracted; a [1] moves the accumulator the slowest, and a [9], the fastest. In the Mercedes-Euklid, a long slotted lever, pivoted at one end, moves nine racks ("straight gears") endwise by distances proportional to their distance from the lever's pivot. Each rack has a drive pin that is moved by the slot. The rack for [1] is closest to the pivot, of course.
For each keyboard digit, a sliding selector gear, much like that in the Leibniz wheel, engages the rack that corresponds to the digit entered. Of course, the accumulator changes either on the forward or reverse stroke, but not both. This mechanism is notably simple and relatively easy to manufacture.

The Marchant, however, has, for every one of its ten columns of keys, a nine-ratio "preselector transmission" with its output spur gear at the top of the machine's body; that gear engages the accumulator gearing. When one tries to work out the numbers of teeth in such a transmission, a straightforward approach leads one to consider a mechanism like that in mechanical gasoline pump registers, used to indicate the total price. However, this mechanism is seriously bulky, and utterly impractical for a calculator; 90-tooth gears are likely to be found in the gas pump. Practical gears in the computing parts of a calculator cannot have 90 teeth. They would be either too big, or too delicate.

Given that nine ratios per column implies significant complexity, a Marchant contains a few hundred individual gears in all, many in its accumulator. Basically, the accumulator dial has to rotate 36 degrees (1/10 of a turn) for a [1], and 324 degrees (9/10 of a turn) for a [9], not allowing for incoming carries. At some point in the gearing, one tooth needs to pass for a [1], and nine teeth for a [9]. There is no way to develop the needed movement from a driveshaft that rotates one revolution per cycle with few gears having practical (relatively small) numbers of teeth.

The Marchant, therefore, has three driveshafts to feed the little transmissions. For one cycle, they rotate 1/2, 1/4, and 1/12 of a revolution. [http://www.johnwolff.id.au/calculators/Tech/MarchantDRX/Actuator.htm]. The 1/2-turn shaft carries (for each column) gears with 12, 14, 16, and 18 teeth, corresponding to digits 6, 7, 8, and 9. The 1/4-turn shaft carries (also, each column) gears with 12, 16, and 20 teeth, for 3, 4, and 5. Digits [1] and [2] are handled by 12 and 24-tooth gears on the 1/12-revolution shaft. Practical design places the 12th-rev. shaft more distant, so the 1/4-turn shaft carries freely-rotating 24 and 12-tooth idler gears. For subtraction, the driveshafts reversed direction.

In the early part of the cycle, one of five pendants moves off-center to engage the appropriate drive gear for the selected digit.

Some machines had as many as 20 columns in their full keyboards. The monster in this field was the ''Duodecillion'' made by [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]] for exhibit purposes.

For sterling currency, £/s/d (and even farthings), there were variations of the basic mechanisms, in particular with different numbers of gear teeth and accumulator dial positions. To accommodate shillings and pence, extra columns were added for the tens digit[s], 10 and 20 for shillings, and 10 for pence. Of course, these functioned as radix-20 and radix-12 mechanisms.

A variant of the Marchant, called the Binary-Octal Marchant, was a radix-8 (octal) machine. It was sold to check very early vacuum-tube (valve) binary computers for accuracy. (Back then, the mechanical calculator was much more reliable than a tube/valve computer.)

As well, there was a twin Marchant, comprising two pinwheel Marchants with a common drive crank and reversing gearbox.[http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/the_twin_marchant.html] Twin machines were relatively rare, and apparently were used for surveying calculations. At least one triple machine was made.

The Facit calculator, and one similar to it, are basically pinwheel machines, but the array of pinwheels moves sidewise, instead of the carriage. The pinwheels are biquinary; digits 1 through 4 cause the corresponding number of sliding pins to  extend from the surface; digits 5 through 9 also extend a five-tooth sector as well as the same pins for 6 through 9.

The keys operate cams that operate a swinging lever to first unlock the pin-positioning cam that is part of the pinwheel mechanism; further movement of the lever (by an amount determined by the key's cam) rotates the pin-positioning cam to extend the necessary number of pins.[http://www.johnwolff.id.au/calculators/Tech/FacitC1-13/C113.htm#Rotor]

Stylus-operated adders with circular slots for the stylus, and side-by -side wheels, as made by Sterling Plastics (USA), had an ingenious anti-overshoot mechanism to ensure accurate carries.

=== The end of an era ===
Mechanical calculators continued to be sold, though in rapidly decreasing numbers, into the early 1970s, with many of the manufacturers closing down or being taken over. [[Comptometer]] type calculators were often retained for much longer to be used for adding and listing duties, especially in accounting, since a trained and skilled operator could enter all the digits of a number in one movement of the hands on a [[Comptometer]] quicker than was possible serially with a 10-key electronic calculator. In fact, it was quicker to enter larger digits in two strokes using only the lower-numbered keys; for instance, a 9 would be entered as 4 followed by 5. Some key-driven calculators had keys for every column, but only 1 through 5; they were correspondingly compact. The spread of the computer rather than the simple electronic calculator put an end to the [[Comptometer]]. Also, by the end of the 1970s, the [[slide rule]] had become obsolete.

'''''Murderous Maths''''' is a [[book series|series]] of [[United Kingdom|British]] educational [[book]]s by author [[Kjartan Poskitt]]. Most of the books in the series are illustrated by illustrator and author [[Philip Reeve]], with the exception of "The Secret Life of Codes", which is illustrated by Ian Baker, "The Essential Arithmetricks: How to plus, minus, times and divide." illustrated by Daniel Postgate and Rob Davis, and "The Murderous Maths of Everything", also illustrated by Rob Davis.

The ''Murderous Maths'' books have been published in over 25 countries. The books, which are aimed at children aged 8 and above, teach [[maths]], spanning from basic arithmetic to relatively complex concepts such as the [[quadratic formula]] and [[trigonometry]]. The books are written in an informal similar style to the ''[[Horrible Histories]]'', ''[[Horrible Science]]'' and ''[[Horrible Geography]]'' series, involving evil geniuses, gangsters, and a generally comedic tone.

==Development==
The first two books of the series were originally part of "The Knowledge" (now "Totally") series ([http://www.kjartan.co.uk/books/books.htm]), itself a spin-off of Horrible Histories. However, these books were eventually redesigned and they, as well as the rest of the titles in the series, now use the Murderous Maths banner. According to Poskitt, "these books have even found their way into schools and proved to be a boost to GCSE studies". The books are also available in foreign editions, including: German, Spanish, Polish, Czech, Greek, Dutch, Norwegian, Turkish, Croatian, Italian, Lithuanian, Korean, Danish, Portuguese, Hungarian, Finnish, Thai and Portuguese (Latin America) [http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/books/books.htm]. In 2009, the books were redesigned again, changing the cover art style and the titles of most of the books in the series.

Poskitt's goal, according to the Murderous Maths website, is to write books that are "something funny to read", have "good amusing illustrations", include "tricks", and "explaining the maths involved as clearly as possible". He adds that although he doesn't "work to any government imposed curriculum or any stage achievement levels", he has "been delighted to receive many messages of support and thanks from parents and teachers in the UK, the United States and elsewhere".

==Reviews==
A recommendation of the series by ''[[Scientific American]]'' includes a quote from a Stanford engineer named Stacy F. Bennet, who described the series as "very humorous and engaging introductions to such topics as algebra, geometry and probability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuchment|first=Anna|title=Dear Santa: Please Send Owl Puke|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dear-santa-please-send-owl-puke/|journal=Scientific American|language=en|volume=303|issue=6|pages=29–29|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1210-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 November 1997, that same publication said of the series, "Have a look at ''Murderous Maths'' by Kjartan Poskitt. It is a truly addictive reading book, and was leapt on and devoured by my children. The book is full of awful jokes, fascinating facts, real murders and yes, the maths is good too. This is a brilliant book."

The ''[[Primary Times]]'' released a review of ''Professor Fiendish's Book of Diabolical Brain-benders'' on November 25, 2002, describing the title as "intriguing, fun to do, and not at all dry", and adding "I warn you, once you start, you'll be 'hooked'!". The ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'' also published a review on the book on December 6, 2002, describing the title as being "action-packed" and reasoning that "behind the non-stop fun, serious mathematical principles are being investigated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/books/BKMMDB.htm#dbrev|title=Professor Fiendish's DIABOLICAl BRAINBENDERS|website=www.murderousmaths.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kjartan did a presentation for 350 kids and 10 teachers at Wolfreton School, Hull in June 2004. Reporter Linda Blackbourne described it as a "stand-up maths routine [that] has children - and teachers - in fits of laughter". ''Carousel'' issue 16 (the guide to children's books) commented on the event: "...he possesses a prodigious gift of the (Yorkshire) gab, appears to be incapable of not enjoying himself, and plays his audience with the finesse of a maestro. Maths will never seem the same again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/tesrev.htm |title=The TIMES EDUCATIONAL SUPPLEMENT Friday 12/11/04 |publisher=Murderousmaths.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Times Educational Supplement'' described Murderous Maths as "A stand-up maths routine has children and teachers in fits of laughter... maths has never been so much fun". The ''Western Gazette'' said: "It is not often that you see a grown maths teacher cry with laughter...", while ''The'' ''[[Worthing]]'' ''Gazette'' said: "The kids went wild, they absolutely loved it...". The ''Stockton Evening Gazette'' said: "Headteacher Barry Winter said it was a stroke of genius inviting the quick-witted author to open the resource centre". The GCSE book in the ''Guardian'' said: "Those who have experienced Poskitt "live" will recognise his commitment to getting readers involved with the learning process" (Nov 6th 2001), and ''[[The Press (York)]]'' described it as "...charismatic..."&lt;ref name="kjartan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kjartan.co.uk/gigs/|title=Kjartan Poskitt  Author Appearances and Maths Shows|website=www.kjartan.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review by science writer [[Brian Clegg (writer)|Brian Clegg]] described his views on ''Murderous Maths: Desperate Measures'': {{quote|It's the usual clever mix of light historical context − mostly ancient from Israelites and Archimedes to the Romans − and real insights into fascinating aspects of something that sits nicely between maths and practical science. There's plenty to keep the reader and interested, and even adults perusing it will have one or two surprises along the way. Because it is very much applied maths, there is also a lot more opportunity to have fun with practical things to try out than has been the case with some of the ''Murderous Maths'' series. All in all this is a great addition to the fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularscience.co.uk/kreviews/rev86.htm|title=Popular Science Children's Review - Murderous Maths: Desperate Measures|website=www.popularscience.co.uk|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Nancy Ann Lynch''' (born January 19, 1948)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7yGvrf3-gskC&amp;q= ''Who's who of American women'']. Marquis Who's Who, 1973. p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt; is a mathematician, a theorist, and a professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. She is the NEC Professor of Software Science and Engineering in the [[Electrical Engineering and Computer Science|EECS]] department and heads the "Theory of Distributed Systems" research group at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

== Education and Early Life ==
Lynch was born in [[Brooklyn]], and her academic training was in mathematics. She attended [[Brooklyn College]] and MIT, where she received her [[Ph.D.]] in 1972 under the supervision of [[Albert R. Meyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|type=Ph.D.|first=Lynch|last=Nancy|title=Relativization of the theory of computational complexity|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|year=1972|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/12180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=81227}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Work ==
She served on the math and computer science faculty at several other universities, including [[Tufts University]], the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], prior to joining the MIT faculty in 1982. Since then, she has been working on applying mathematics to the tasks of understanding and constructing complex distributed systems.

Her 1985 work with [[Michael J. Fischer]] and [[Mike Paterson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fischer|Lynch|Paterson|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[consensus (computer science)|consensus problems]] received the [[PODC Influential-Paper Award]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="podc-award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.podc.org/influential/2001.html|title=PODC Influential Paper Award: 2001|accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work showed that in an asynchronous distributed system, consensus is impossible if there is one processor that crashes. On their contribution, [[Jennifer Welch]] wrote that “this result has had a monumental impact in distributed computing, both theory and practice. Systems designers were motivated to clarify their claims concerning under what circumstances the systems work.”&lt;ref name="podc-award" /&gt;

She is the author of numerous research articles about distributed algorithms and impossibility results, and about formal modeling and validation of distributed systems (see, e.g., [[input/output automaton]]). She is the author of the graduate textbook "Distributed Algorithms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Distributed Algorithms|last=Lynch|first=Nancy|publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann Publishers]]|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55860-348-6|location=San Francisco, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and an ACM Fellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://awards.acm.org/award_winners/lynch_2276129.cfm|title=Nancy A Lynch – Award Winner|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]]|accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5010">In [[convex geometry]], the '''projection body''' &lt;math&gt;\Pi K&lt;/math&gt; of a [[convex body]] &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; in ''n''-dimensional  [[Euclidean space]] is the convex body such that for any vector &lt;math&gt;u\in S^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[support function]] of &lt;math&gt;\Pi K&lt;/math&gt; in the direction ''u'' is the (''n''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional volume of the projection of ''K'' onto the [[hyperplane]] orthogonal to ''u''. 

Minkowski showed that the projection body of a convex body is convex. {{harvtxt|Petty|1967}} and {{harvtxt|Schneider|1967}} used projection bodies in their solution to [[Shephard's problem]].

For &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; a convex body, let &lt;math&gt;\Pi^\circ K&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[Polar set|polar body]] of its projection body. There are two remarkable affine isoperimetric inequality for this body. {{harvtxt|Petty|1971}} proved that for all convex bodies &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; V_n(K)^{n-1} V_n(\Pi^\circ K)\le V_n(B^n)^{n-1} V_n(\Pi^\circ B^n),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;B^n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''n''-dimensional unit ball and &lt;math&gt;V_n&lt;/math&gt; is ''n''-dimensional volume, and there is equality precisely for ellipsoids. {{harvtxt|Zhang|1991}} proved that for all convex bodies &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; V_n(K)^{n-1} V_n(\Pi^\circ K)\ge V_n(T^n)^{n-1} V_n(\Pi^\circ T^n),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt; denotes any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional simplex, and there is equality precisely for such simplices.

The '''intersection body''' ''IK'' of ''K'' is defined similarly, as the star body such that for any vector ''u'' the radial function of ''IK'' from the origin in direction ''u'' is the (''n''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional volume of the intersection of ''K'' with the hyperplane ''u''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/sup&gt;.
Equivalently, the radial function of the intersection body ''IK'' is the [[Funk transform]] of the radial function of ''K''.
Intersection bodies were introduced by {{harvtxt|Lutwak|1988}}.

{{harvtxt|Koldobsky|1998a}}  showed that a centrally symmetric star-shaped body is an intersection body if and only if the function 1/||''x''|| is a positive definite distribution, where ||''x''|| is the homogeneous function of degree 1 that is 1 on the boundary of the body, and {{harvtxt|Koldobsky|1998b}} used this to show that the unit balls l{{su|b=''n''|p = ''p''}}, 2&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;∞ in ''n''-dimensional space with the [[Lp norm|l&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm]] are intersection bodies for ''n''=4 but are not intersection bodies for&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;5.

In [[mathematics]], a '''quasisymmetric''' [[homeomorphism]] between metric spaces is a map that generalizes [[lipschitz function|bi-Lipschitz]] maps. While bi-Lipschitz maps shrink or expand the diameter of a set by no more than a multiplicative factor, quasisymmetric maps satisfy the weaker geometric property that they preserve the relative sizes of sets: if two sets ''A'' and ''B'' have diameters ''t'' and are no more than distance ''t'' apart, then the ratio of their sizes changes by no more than a multiplicative constant. These maps are also related to [[quasiconformal]] maps, since in many circumstances they are in fact equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Heinonen| first = Juha | title = Lectures on Analysis on Metric Spaces | series = Universitext | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | year = 2001 | pages = x+140 | ISBN = 0-387-95104-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''Y'',&amp;nbsp;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;) be two [[metric space]]s. A [[homeomorphism]] ''f'':''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is said to be '''η-quasisymmetric''' if there is an increasing function ''η''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;∞)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;∞) such that for any triple ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'' of distinct points in ''X'', we have

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d_Y(f(x),f(y))}{d_{Y}(f(x),f(z))} \leq \eta\left(\frac{d_X(x,y)}{d_X(x,z)}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

==Basic properties==

; Inverses are quasisymmetric : If ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is an invertible ''η''-quasisymmetric map as above, then its inverse map is &lt;math&gt;\eta'&lt;/math&gt;-quasisymmetric, where &lt;math&gt;\eta'&lt;/math&gt;(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''η''(1/''t'').
; Quasisymmetric maps preserve relative sizes of sets : If ''A'' and ''B'' are subsets of ''X'' and ''A'' is a subset of ''B'', then
:: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2\eta(\frac{\text{diam }A}{\text{diam }B})}\leq \frac{\text{diam }f(B)}{\text{diam }f(A)}\leq \eta\left(\frac{2\text{diam }B}{\text{diam }A}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

===Weakly quasisymmetric maps===

A map ''f:X→Y'' is said to be '''H-weakly-quasisymmetric''' for some ''H''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 if for all triples of distinct points ''x,y,z'' in ''X'', we have
:&lt;math&gt; |f(x)-f(y)|\leq H|f(x)-f(z)|\;\;\;\text{ whenever }\;\;\; |x-y|\leq |x-z|&lt;/math&gt;

Not all weakly quasisymmetric maps are quasisymmetric. However, if ''X'' is [[Connected space|connected]] and ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[doubling measures and metric spaces|doubling]], then all weakly quasisymmetric maps are quasisymmetric. The appeal of this result is that proving weak-quasisymmetry is much easier than proving quasisymmetry directly, and in many natural settings the two notions are equivalent.

===δ-monotone maps===

A [[Monotone map#Monotonicity in functional analysis|monotone map]] ''f'':''H''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''H'' on a [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' is '''δ-monotone''' if for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''H'',
:&lt;math&gt; \langle f(x)-f(y),x-y\rangle\geq \delta |f(x)-f(y)|\cdot|x-y|.&lt;/math&gt;

To grasp what this condition means geometrically, suppose ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and consider the above estimate when ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Then it implies that the angle between the vector ''x'' and its image ''f''(''x'') stays between 0 and arccos&amp;nbsp;''δ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''π''/2.

These maps are quasisymmetric, although they are a much narrower subclass of quasisymmetric maps. For example, while a general quasisymmetric map in the complex plane could map the real line to a set of [[Hausdorff dimension]] strictly greater than one, a ''δ''-monotone will always map the real line to a rotated [[Graph of a function|graph]] of a Lipschitz function ''L'':ℝ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;ℝ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kovalev | first = Leonid V. | title= Quasiconformal geometry of monotone mappings | journal = Journal of the London Mathematical Society | volume = 75 | year = 2007 | number = 2 | pages = 391–408 | doi=10.1112/jlms/jdm008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doubling measures==

===The real line===

Quasisymmetric homeomorphisms of the [[real line]] to itself can be characterized in terms of their derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Beurling | first = A. |author2=Ahlfors, L. |authorlink2=Lars Ahlfors  | title = The boundary correspondence under quasiconformal mappings | journal = Acta Math. | volume=  96 | year = 1956 | pages = 125–142| doi=10.1007/bf02392360}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing homeomorphism ''f'':ℝ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;ℝ is quasisymmetric if and only if there is a constant ''C''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and  a [[doubling measures and metric spaces|doubling measure]] ''μ'' on the real line such that

:&lt;math&gt; f(x)=C+\int_0^x \, d\mu(t).&lt;/math&gt;

===Euclidean space===

An analogous result holds in Euclidean space. Suppose ''C''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and we rewrite the above equation for ''f'' as 
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left(\frac{x-t}{|x-t|}+\frac{t}{|t|}\right)d\mu(t).&lt;/math&gt;

Writing it this way, we can attempt to define a map using this same integral, but instead integrate (what is now a vector valued integrand) over ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;: if ''μ'' is a doubling measure on ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt; \int_{|x|&gt;1}\frac{1}{|x|}\,d\mu(x)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;
then the map
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\left(\frac{x-y}{|x-y|}+\frac{y}{|y|}\right)\,d\mu(y)&lt;/math&gt;
is quasisymmetric (in fact, it is ''δ''-monotone for some ''δ'' depending on the measure ''μ'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kovalev | first = Leonid | last2 = Maldonado | first2 =  Diego | last3 = Wu | first3 = Jang-Mei | title = Doubling measures, monotonicity, and quasiconformality |journal= Math. Z. | volume = 257 | year = 2007 | number = 3 | pages = 525–545 | arxiv=math/0611110 | doi=10.1007/s00209-007-0132-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quasisymmetry and quasiconformality in Euclidean space==

Let ''Ω'' and ''Ω´'' be open subsets of ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. If ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;Ω´ is ''η''-quasisymmetric, then it is also ''K''-[[quasiconformal]], where ''K''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 is a constant depending on ''η''.

Conversely, if ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;Ω´ is ''K''-quasiconformal and ''B''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;2''r'') is contained in ''Ω'', then ''f'' is ''η''-quasisymmetric on ''B''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''r''), where ''η'' depends only on&amp;nbsp;''K''.

[[File:Two red dice 01.svg|thumb|[[Dice]] are an example of a mechanical hardware random number generator. When a cubical die is rolled, a random number between 1 and 6 is obtained.|alt=]]
A '''random number generator''' (RNG) is a device that generates a sequence of [[number]]s or symbols that cannot be reasonably predicted better than by a [[random]] chance. Random number generators can be true '''[[Hardware random number generator|hardware random-number generators]]''' (HRNG), which generate genuinely random numbers, or '''[[Pseudorandom number generator|pseudo-random number generators]]''' (PRNG) which generate numbers which look random, but are actually deterministic, and can be reproduced if the state of the PRNG is known.

Various [[applications of randomness]] have led to the development of several different methods for generating [[randomness|random]] data, of which some have existed since ancient times, among whose ranks are well-known "classic" examples, including the rolling of [[dice]], [[coin flipping]], the [[shuffling]] of [[playing card]]s, the use of [[yarrow]] stalks (for [[divination]]) in the [[I Ching]], as well as countless other techniques. Because of the mechanical nature of these techniques, generating large numbers of sufficiently random numbers (important in statistics) required a lot of work and/or time. Thus, results would sometimes be collected and distributed as [[random number table]]s.

Several computational methods for pseudo-random number generation exist. All fall short of the goal of true randomness, although they may meet, with varying success, some of the [[statistical randomness|statistical tests for randomness]] intended to measure how unpredictable their results are (that is, to what degree their patterns are discernible). This generally makes them unusable for applications such as [[cryptography]]. However, carefully designed [[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator|'''cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators''']] (CSPRNG) also exist, with special features specifically designed for use in cryptography.

== Practical applications and uses ==
{{Main|Applications of randomness}}

Random number generators have applications in [[gambling]], [[statistical sampling]], [[computer simulation]], [[cryptography]], [[completely randomized design]], and other areas where producing an unpredictable result is desirable.  Generally, in applications having unpredictability as the paramount, such as in security applications, [[Hardware random number generator|hardware generators]] are generally preferred over pseudo-random algorithms, where feasible.

Random number generators are very useful in developing  [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo-method]] simulations, as [[debugging]] is facilitated by the ability to run the same sequence of random numbers again by starting from the same ''[[random seed]]''. They are also used in [[cryptography]] – so long as the ''seed'' is secret. Sender and  receiver can generate the same set of numbers automatically to use as keys.

The generation of [[pseudo-random number]]s is an important and common task in computer programming. While cryptography and certain numerical algorithms require a very high degree of ''apparent'' randomness, many other operations only need a modest amount of unpredictability. Some simple examples might be presenting a user with a "Random Quote of the Day", or determining which way a computer-controlled adversary might move in a computer game. Weaker forms of ''randomness'' are used in [[hash algorithm]]s and in creating [[amortization|amortized]] [[search algorithm|searching]] and [[sorting algorithm]]s.

Some applications which appear at first sight to be suitable for randomization are in fact not quite so simple. For instance, a system that "randomly" selects music tracks for a background music system must only ''appear'' random, and may even have ways to control the selection of music: a true random system would have no restriction on the same item appearing two or three times in succession.

== "True" vs. pseudo-random numbers ==
{{Main|Pseudorandom number generator}}
{{See also|Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator}}

There are two principal methods used to generate random numbers. The first method measures some physical phenomenon that is expected to be random and then compensates for possible biases in the measurement process. Example sources include measuring [[atmospheric noise]], thermal noise, and other external electromagnetic and quantum phenomena. For example, cosmic background radiation or radioactive decay as measured over short timescales represent sources of natural [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].

The speed at which entropy can be harvested from natural sources is dependent on the underlying physical phenomena being measured. Thus, sources of naturally occurring "true" entropy are said to be [[blocking (computing)|blocking]]{{snd}} they are rate-limited until enough entropy is harvested to meet the demand. On some Unix-like systems, including most [[Linux distribution]]s, the pseudo device file {{Mono|[[/dev/random]]}} will block until sufficient entropy is harvested from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{man|4|random|Linux}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this blocking behavior, large bulk reads from {{Mono|[[/dev/random]]}}, such as filling a [[hard disk drive]] with random bits, can often be slow on systems that use this type of entropy source.

The second method uses computational [[algorithm]]s that can produce long sequences of apparently random results, which are in fact completely determined by a shorter initial value, known as a seed value or [[key (cryptography)|key]]. As a result, the entire seemingly random sequence can be reproduced if the seed value is known. This type of random number generator is often called a [[pseudorandom number generator]]. This type of generator typically does not rely on sources of naturally occurring entropy, though it may be periodically seeded by natural sources. This generator type is non-blocking, so they are not rate-limited by an external event, making large bulk reads a possibility.

Some systems take a hybrid approach, providing randomness harvested from natural sources when available, and falling back to periodically re-seeded software-based [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]]s (CSPRNGs). The fallback occurs when the desired read rate of randomness exceeds the ability of the natural harvesting approach to keep up with the demand. This approach avoids the rate-limited blocking behavior of random number generators based on slower and purely environmental methods.

While a pseudorandom number generator based solely on deterministic logic can never be regarded as a "true" random number source in the purest sense of the word, in practice they are generally sufficient even for demanding security-critical applications. Indeed, carefully designed and implemented pseudo-random number generators can be certified for security-critical cryptographic purposes, as is the case with the [[yarrow algorithm]] and [[fortuna (PRNG)|fortuna]]. The former is the basis of the {{Mono|/dev/random}} source of entropy on [[FreeBSD]], [[AIX]], [[OS&amp;nbsp;X]], [[NetBSD]], and others. [[OpenBSD]] also uses a pseudo-random number algorithm based on [[ChaCha20]] known as [[RC4#RC4-based random number generators|arc4random]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bxr.su/OpenBSD/lib/libc/crypt/arc4random.c |title=libc/crypt/arc4random.c |first= |last= |website=BSD Cross Reference, OpenBSD src/lib/ |editor=deraadt |editor-link=Theo de Raadt |date=2014-07-21 |accessdate=2015-01-13 |quote=ChaCha based random number generator for OpenBSD.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generation methods ==

=== Physical methods ===
{{Main|Hardware random number generator}}

The earliest methods for generating random numbers, such as [[dice]], [[coin flipping]] and [[roulette]] wheels, are still used today, mainly in [[game]]s and gambling as they tend to be too slow for most applications in statistics and cryptography.

A physical random number generator can be based on an essentially random atomic or subatomic physical phenomenon whose unpredictability can be traced to the laws of [[quantum mechanics]]. Sources of [[entropy (information theory)|entropy]] include [[radioactive decay]], [[Johnson–Nyquist noise|thermal noise]], [[shot noise]], avalanche noise in [[Zener diode]]s, [[clock drift#Random number generators|clock drift]], the timing of actual movements of a [[hard disk]] read/write head, and [[Noise (radio)|radio noise]].  However, physical phenomena and tools used to measure them generally feature asymmetries and [[systematic bias]]es that make their outcomes not uniformly random.  A [[randomness extractor]], such as a [[cryptographic hash function]], can be used to approach a uniform distribution of bits from a non-uniformly random source, though at a lower bit rate.

The appearance of wideband photonic entropy sources such as chaotic laser and amplified spontaneous emission noise greatly promote the rapid development of the physical random number generator. Among them, laser chaos&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Pu|last2=Wang|first2=Yun-Cai|last3=Zhang|first3=Jian-Zhong|date=2010-09-13|title=All-optical fast random number generator|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-18-19-20360|journal=Optics Express|language=EN|volume=18|issue=19|pages=20360–20369|doi=10.1364/OE.18.020360|issn=1094-4087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Pu|last2=Sun|first2=Yuanyuan|last3=Liu|first3=Xianglian|last4=Yi|first4=Xiaogang|last5=Zhang|first5=Jianguo|last6=Guo|first6=Xiaomin|last7=Guo|first7=Yanqiang|last8=Wang|first8=Yuncai|date=2016-07-15|title=Fully photonics-based physical random bit generator|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-41-14-3347|journal=Optics Letters|language=EN|volume=41|issue=14|pages=3347–3350|doi=10.1364/OL.41.003347|issn=1539-4794}}&lt;/ref&gt; gets great concerns to produce high-speed physical random numbers due to its merits of the high bandwidth and large amplitude.

Various imaginative ways of collecting this entropic information have been devised. One technique is to run a hash function against a frame of a video stream from an unpredictable source. [[Lavarand]] used this technique with images of a number of [[lava lamp]]s. [http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/ HotBits] measures radioactive decay with [[Geiger–Muller tube]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another common entropy source is the behavior of human users of the system. While people are not considered good randomness generators upon request, they generate random behavior quite well in the context of playing [[mixed strategy]] games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

=== Computational methods ===
Most computer generated random numbers use [[pseudorandom number generator]]s (PRNGs) which are [[algorithm]]s that can automatically create long runs of numbers with good random properties but eventually the sequence repeats (or the memory usage grows without bound). These random numbers are fine in many situations but are not as random as numbers generated from electromagnetic atmospheric noise used as a source of entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RANDOM.ORG - True Random Number Service|url = https://www.random.org/|website = www.random.org|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series of values generated by such algorithms is generally determined by a fixed number called a '''seed.''' One of the most common PRNG is the [[linear congruential generator]], which uses the recurrence

:&lt;math&gt;X_{n+1} = (a X_n + b)\, \textrm{mod}\, m&lt;/math&gt;

to generate numbers, where {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|m}} are large integers, and &lt;math&gt;X_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is the next in {{mvar|X}} as a series of pseudo-random numbers. The maximum number of numbers the formula can produce is one less than the [[Modulus (algebraic number theory)|modulus]], {{mvar|m}}-1. The recurrence relation can be extended to matrices to have much longer periods and better statistical properties
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = High Dimensionality Pseudo Random Number Generators
 | url = http://www.ianschumacher.ca/prng/article.html
 | accessdate = 2018-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.
To avoid certain non-random properties of a single linear congruential generator, several such random number generators with slightly different values of the multiplier coefficient, {{mvar|a}}, can be used in parallel, with a "master" random number generator that selects from among the several different generators.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

A simple pen-and-paper method for generating random numbers is the so-called [[middle square method]] suggested by [[John von Neumann]]. While simple to implement, its output is of poor quality. It has a very short period and severe weaknesses, such as the output sequence almost always converging to zero.  A recent innovation is to combine the middle square with a [[Weyl sequence]]. This method produces high quality output through a long period.  See [[middle square method#Middle Square Weyl Sequence PRNG|Middle Square Weyl Sequence PRNG]].

Most computer programming languages include functions or library routines that provide random number generators. They are often designed to provide a random byte or word, or a [[floating point]] number [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] between 0 and 1.

The quality i.e. randomness of such library functions varies widely from completely predictable output, to cryptographically secure. The default random number generator in many languages, including Python, Ruby, R, IDL and PHP is based on the [[Mersenne Twister]] algorithm and is ''not'' sufficient for cryptography purposes, as is explicitly stated in the language documentation. Such library functions often have poor statistical properties and some will repeat patterns after only tens of thousands of trials.  They are often initialized using a computer's [[real time clock]] as the seed, since such a clock generally measures in milliseconds, far beyond the person's [[Accuracy and precision|precision]]. These functions may provide enough randomness for certain tasks (for example video games) but are unsuitable where high-quality randomness is required, such as in cryptography applications, statistics or numerical analysis.{{Citation needed|reason=Why unsuitable for numerical analysis?|date=May 2014}}

Much higher quality random number sources are available on most operating systems;  for example [[/dev/random]] on various BSD flavors, Linux, Mac OS X, IRIX, and Solaris, or [[CryptGenRandom]] for Microsoft Windows. Most programming languages, including those mentioned above, provide a means to access these higher quality sources.

=== Generation from a probability distribution ===
There are a couple of methods to generate a random number based on a [[probability density function]]. These methods involve transforming a uniform random number in some way.  Because of this, these methods work equally well in generating both pseudo-random and true random numbers. One method, called the [[Inverse transform sampling|inversion method]], involves integrating up to an area greater than or equal to the random number (which should be generated between 0 and 1 for proper distributions). A second method, called the [[Rejection sampling|acceptance-rejection method]], involves choosing an x and y value and testing whether the function of x is greater than the y value.  If it is, the x value is accepted.  Otherwise, the x value is rejected and the algorithm tries again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== By humans ===
Random number generation may also be performed by humans, in the form of collecting various inputs from [[end user]]s and using them as a randomization source. However, most studies find that human subjects have some degree of non-randomness when attempting to produce a random sequence of e.g. digits or letters.  They may alternate too much between choices when compared to a good random generator;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, this approach is not widely used.

== Post-processing and statistical checks ==
{{See also|Statistical randomness|List of random number generators}}
Even given a source of plausible random numbers (perhaps from a quantum mechanically based hardware generator), obtaining numbers which are completely unbiased takes care. In addition, behavior of these generators often changes with temperature, power supply voltage, the age of the device, or other outside interference. And a software bug in a pseudo-random number routine, or a hardware bug in the hardware it runs on, may be similarly difficult to detect.

Generated random numbers are sometimes subjected to statistical tests before use to ensure that the underlying source is still working, and then post-processed to improve their statistical properties. An example would be the TRNG9803&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dömstedt|first=B.|title=TRNG9803 True Random Number Generator|url=http://www.trng98.se/serial_trng_9803.html|publisher=www.TRNG98.se|location=Manufacturer|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; hardware random number generator, which uses an entropy measurement as a hardware test, and then post-processes the random sequence with a shift register stream cipher. It is generally hard to use statistical tests to validate the generated random numbers. Wang and Nicol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wang|first=Yongge|title=Statistical Properties of Pseudo Random Sequences and Experiments with PHP and Debian OpenSSL|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-11203-9_26|publisher=Springer LNCS|location=Heidelberg|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a distance-based statistical testing technique that is used to identify the weaknesses of several random generators. Li and Wang&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Pu|last2=Yi|first2=Xiaogang|last3=Liu|first3=Xianglian|last4=Wang|first4=Yuncai|last5=Wang|first5=Yongge|date=2016-07-11|title=Brownian motion properties of optoelectronic random bit generators based on laser chaos|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-24-14-15822|journal=Optics Express|language=EN|volume=24|issue=14|pages=15822–15833|doi=10.1364/OE.24.015822|issn=1094-4087}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a method of testing random numbers based on laser chaotic entropy sources using Brownian motion properties.

== Other considerations ==
Random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 can be used to generate random numbers of any desired distribution by passing them through the inverse [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF) of the desired distribution (see [[Inverse transform sampling]]). Inverse CDFs are also called [[quantile function]]s. To generate a pair of [[Statistical independence|statistically independent]] [[Normal distribution|standard normally distributed]] random numbers (''x'', ''y''), one may first generate the [[polar coordinates]] (''r'', ''θ''), where ''r''~[[Chi-squared distribution|χ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] and ''θ''~[[Uniform distribution (continuous)|UNIFORM(0,2π)]] (see [[Box–Muller transform]]).

Some 0 to 1 RNGs include 0 but exclude 1, while others include or exclude both.

The outputs of multiple independent RNGs can be combined (for example, using a bit-wise [[XOR]] operation) to provide a combined RNG at least as good as the best RNG used. This is referred to as [[Hardware random number generator#Software whitening|software whitening]].

Computational and hardware random number generators are sometimes combined to reflect the benefits of both kinds. Computational random number generators can typically generate pseudo-random numbers much faster than physical generators, while physical generators can generate "true randomness."

== Low-discrepancy sequences as an alternative ==
Some computations making use of a random number generator can be summarized as the computation of a total or average value, such as the computation of integrals by the [[Monte Carlo method]]. For such problems, it may be possible to find a more accurate solution by the use of so-called [[low-discrepancy sequence]]s, also called [[quasirandom]] numbers. Such sequences have a definite pattern that fills in gaps evenly, qualitatively speaking; a truly random sequence may, and usually does, leave larger gaps.

== Activities and demonstrations ==
The following sites make available Random Number samples:
# The [[SOCR]] resource pages contain a number of [http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_EduMaterials_Activities_RNG hands-on interactive activities and demonstrations] of random number generation using Java applets.

== Backdoors ==
{{Main|Random number generator attack}}
Since much cryptography depends on a cryptographically secure random number generator for key and [[cryptographic nonce]] generation, if a random number generator can be made predictable, it can be used as [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] by an attacker to break the encryption.

The NSA is reported to have inserted a backdoor into the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] certified [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]] [[Dual_EC_DRBG]]. If for example an SSL connection is created using this random number generator, then according to [[Matthew Green (cryptographer)|Matthew Green]] it would allow NSA to determine the state of the random number generator, and thereby eventually be able to read all data sent over the SSL connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/the-many-flaws-of-dualecdrbg.html|title=The Many Flaws of Dual_EC_DRBG|author=matthew Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it was apparent that Dual_EC_DRBG was a very poor and possibly backdoored pseudorandom number generator long before the NSA backdoor was confirmed in 2013, it had seen significant usage in practice until 2013, for example by the prominent security company [[RSA Security]].&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/rsa-warns-developers-against-its-own.html|title=RSA warns developers not to use RSA products|author=Matthew Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have subsequently been accusations that RSA Security knowingly inserted a NSA backdoor into its products, possibly as part of the [[Bullrun (decryption program)|Bullrun program]]. RSA has denied knowingly inserting a backdoor into its products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/we-dont-enable-backdoors-in-our-crypto-products-rsa-tells-customers/|title=We don’t enable backdoors in our crypto products, RSA tells customers|publisher=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been theorized that hardware RNGs could be secretly modified to have less entropy than stated, which would make encryption using the hardware RNG susceptible to attack. One such method which has been published works by modifying the dopant mask of the chip, which would be undetectable to optical reverse-engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/researchers-can-slip-an-undetectable-trojan-into-intels-ivy-bridge-cpus/|title=Researchers can slip an undetectable trojan into Intel’s Ivy Bridge CPUs|publisher=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for random number generation in Linux, it is seen as unacceptable to use Intel's [[RdRand]] hardware RNG without mixing in the RdRand output with other sources of entropy to counteract any backdoors in the hardware RNG, especially after the revelation of the NSA Bullrun program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/117091380454742934025/posts/SDcoemc9V3J|title=I am so glad I resisted pressure from Intel engineers to let /dev/random rely only on the RdRand instruction. |publisher=Google Plus|author=Theodore Ts'o}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/567077/|title=Re: [PATCH] /dev/random: Insufficient of entropy on many architectures|publisher=LWN|author=Theodore Ts'o}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Hot Lotto fraud scandal|a U.S. lottery draw was rigged]] by the information security director of the [[Multi-State Lottery Association]] (MUSL), who surreptitiously installed backdoor [[malware]] on the MUSL's secure RNG computer during routine maintenance.&lt;ref name="dailybeast-hotlotto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nestel|first1=M.L.|title=Inside the Biggest Lottery Scam Ever|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/07/inside-the-biggest-lottery-scam-ever.html|accessdate=July 10, 2015|work=The Daily Beast|date=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the hacks the man won a total amount of $16,500,000 by predicting the numbers correct a few times in year.

ASLR or Address Space Layout Randomization, a mitigation against rowhammer and related attacks on the physical hardware of memory chips has been found to be inadequate as of early 2017 by VUSec. The random number algorithm if based on a shift register implemented in hardware is predictable at sufficiently large values of p and can be reverse engineered with enough processing power.
This also indirectly means that malware using this method can run on both GPUs and CPUs if coded to do so, even using GPU to break ASLR on the CPU itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vusec.net/projects/anc/|title=AnC - VUSec|publisher=|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir Robert Romer 12 December 1891.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' caricature, 1891]]
'''Sir Robert Romer''', [[Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (23 December 1840 &amp;ndash; 19 March 1918) was a British judge. He was a [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|High Court judge]] 1890-1899, and a [[Lord Justice of Appeal]] 1899-1906 when he was known as '''Lord Justice Romer'''.

==Biography==
Romer was born in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]], [[Middlesex]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/35819 Romer, Sir Robert] Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[St John's School, Leatherhead]] (in Surrey) and excelled at mathematics at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] where he was [[Senior Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Senior Wrangler]] in 1863 (the first from Trinity Hall) and was joint winner of [[Smith's Prize]] in that year.&lt;ref&gt;St John's School, Leatherhead. School Register 1852-1904&lt;/ref&gt; Following the premature late 1864 death of [[George Boole]], the first professor of maths at Queen's College, Cork, Romer beat out [[Robert Stawell Ball|Robert Ball]] for the vacant position, however he only stayed in Cork for 1865-1866.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/reminiscenceslet00balluoft/reminiscenceslet00balluoft_djvu.txt Reminiscences and Letters of Sir Robert Ball] Edited By W. Vaihntine Ball&lt;/ref&gt; He became [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] in 1881, and a bencher of [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;[http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search-2016.pl?sur=&amp;suro=w&amp;fir=&amp;firo=c&amp;cit=&amp;cito=c&amp;c=all&amp;z=all&amp;tex=RMR859R&amp;sye=&amp;eye=&amp;col=all&amp;maxcount=50 Robert Romer] ACAD: A Cambridge Alumni Database from 1200 to 1900&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he unsuccessfully stood as the Liberal candidate in [[Brighton (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighton]].

In 1890 he was appointed [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|High Court judge]] and assigned to the [[Chancery Division]], receiving the customary [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]]. He served as such until 1899, when he was appointed a [[Lord Justice of Appeal]], in succession to [[Joseph William Chitty|Chitty]]. He resigned in 1906.

Romer was sworn a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillor]] in 1899, and elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in the same year. He was appointed [[Order of the Bath|Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] (GCB) in the New Year Honours list 1 January 1901,&lt;ref name="GCB"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27264 |date=8 January 1901 |page=157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was invested by [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] in February the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Thursday |date=14 February 1901 |page_number=6 |issue=36378| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the Royal Commission on South African Hospitals in 1901, during the [[Boer War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Royal Commission on South African Hospitals|pmc=2400194 | pages=236–240 | volume=1|issue=2091|journal=British Medical Journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.2091.236|year=1901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Royal Commission on University Education in London in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thomas Carlyle Parkinson, M.D. (Sydney)|pmc=2318341 | page=574 | volume=1|issue=2513|journal=British Medical Journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.2513.574|year=1909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1864 he married his first cousin Betty Lemon, daughter of his aunt Helen (Nelly) Romer and [[Mark Lemon]], editor of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.  Their son was [[Mark Romer, Baron Romer]] and their grandson was [[Charles Romer|Sir Charles Robert Romer]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genealogy.com/forum/surnames/topics/romer/100/ Re: Robert Romer, England, 1860s] genealogy.com&lt;/ref&gt; both were also Lords Justice of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/index1769.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331185148/http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/index1769.htm |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter Helen Mary married future [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Frederic Maugham, 1st Viscount Maugham|Frederic Maugham]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5602">'''Ruth F. Curtain''' (born 1941) is an Australian mathematician who worked for many years in the [[Netherlands]] as a professor of mathematics at the [[University of Groningen]]. Her research concerns infinite-dimensional [[linear system]]s.{{r|rug}}

==Education and career==
Curtain was born in [[Melbourne]].{{r|rug}} She was the daughter of a house painter, who wanted her to leave school at age 14, but with the support of her mother she persisted.{{r|nrc}} She studied mathematics at the [[University of Melbourne]], earning a bachelor's degree in 1962, diploma in education in 1963, and master's degree in 1965.{{r|rug}} She moved to [[Brown University]], in the United States, for graduate study in applied mathematics, and completed her Ph.D. there in 1969. Her dissertation, ''Stochastic Differential Equations In A Hilbert Space'', was supervised by Peter Falb.{{r|rug|mgp}}

She then joined the faculty at [[Purdue University]], but in 1971 moved to the [[University of Warwick]]. In 1977 she moved again, to the University of Groningen, where she remained until her 2006 retirement.{{r|rug}}

==Books==
Curtain is the author of:
*''Functional Analysis in Modern Applied Mathematics'' (with A. J. Pritchard, Academic Press, 1977){{r|famam}}
*''Infinite Dimensional Linear Systems Theory'' (with A. J. Pritchard, Springer, 1978){{r|idlst}}
*''An Introduction to Infinite-Dimensional Linear Systems Theory'' (with Hans Zwart, Springer, 1995){{r|intro}}

==Awards and honours==
In 1991 Curtain was elected as a Fellow of the [[IEEE]], associated with the [[IEEE Control Systems Society]], "for contributions to the control theory of stochastic and infinite-dimensional systems".{{r|fellow}}

In 2012 the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] gave Curtain their [[W. T. and Idalia Reid Prize]] for outstanding research in [[differential equation]]s and [[control theory]]. The award citation recognized Curtain for her "fundamental contributions to the theory of infinite dimensional systems and the control of systems governed by partial and delay differential equation".{{r|reid}}

In [[computational electromagnetics]], the '''scattering-matrix method''' ('''SMM''') is a [[numerical method]] used to solve [[Maxwell's equations]].&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

SMM can, for example, use cylinders to model [[dielectric]]/[[metal]] objects in the domain.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The total-field/scattered-field (TF/SF) formalism where the total field is written as sum of incident and scattered at each point in the domain:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{tot} = E_{inc} + E_{scatt} \ &lt;/math&gt;

By assuming series solutions for the total field, the SMM method transforms the domain into a cylindrical problem. In this domain total field is written in terms of [[Bessel function|Bessel]] and [[Hankel function]] solutions to the cylindrical [[Helmholtz equation]]. SMM method formulation, finally helps compute these coefficients of the cylindrical harmonic functions within the cylinder and outside it, at the same time satisfying EM boundary conditions.

Finally, SMM accuracy can be increased by adding (removing) cylindrical harmonic terms used to model the scattered fields.

SMM, eventually leads to a matrix formalism, and the coefficients are calculated through matrix inversion. For N-cylinders, each scattered field modeled using 2M+1 harmonic terms, SMM requires to solve a N(2M + 1) system of equations. 

==Advantages==

SMM, is a rigorous and accurate method deriving from first principles. Hence, it is guaranteed to be accurate within limits of model, and not show suprious effects of numerical dispersion arising in other techniques like [[Finite-difference time-domain method|FDTD]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9051">In [[coding theory]], the '''Singleton bound''', named after Richard Collom Singleton, is a relatively crude upper bound on the size of an arbitrary [[block code]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with block length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, size &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and minimum distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statement of the bound==
The minimum distance of a set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of codewords of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;d = \min_{\{x,y \in C : x \neq y\}} d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hamming distance]] between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. The expression &lt;math&gt;A_{q}(n,d)&lt;/math&gt; represents the maximum number of possible codewords in a &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;-ary block code of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and minimum distance&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the Singleton bound states that

:&lt;math&gt;A_q(n,d) \leq q^{n-d+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
First observe that the number of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;-ary words of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;q^n&lt;/math&gt;, since each letter in such a word may take one of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; different values, independently of the remaining letters.

Now let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;-ary block code of minimum distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, all codewords &lt;math&gt;c \in C&lt;/math&gt; are distinct. If we [[Puncturing|puncture]] the code by deleting the first &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; letters of each codeword, then all resulting codewords must still be pairwise different, since all of the original codewords in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; have [[Hamming distance]] at least &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; from each other. Thus the size of the altered code is the same as the original code.

The newly obtained codewords each have length

:&lt;math&gt;n-(d-1)=n-d+1&lt;/math&gt;,

and thus, there can be at most &lt;math&gt;q^{n-d+1}&lt;/math&gt; of them. Since &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; was arbitrary, this bound must hold for the largest possible code with these parameters, thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ling|Xing|2004|loc=p. 93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|C| \le A_q(n,d) \leq q^{n-d+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Linear codes==

If &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear code]] with block length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, dimension &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and minimum distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; over the [[finite field]] with &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; elements, then the maximum number of codewords is &lt;math&gt;q^k&lt;/math&gt; and the Singleton bound implies:
:&lt;math&gt;q^k \leq q^{n-d+1}&lt;/math&gt;,
so that
:&lt;math&gt;k \leq n - d + 1&lt;/math&gt;,
which is usually written as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roman|1992|loc=p. 175}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;d \leq n - k + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

In the linear code case a different proof of the Singleton bound can be obtained by observing that rank of the [[parity check matrix]] is &lt;math&gt; n - k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pless|1998|loc=p. 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another simple proof follows from observing that the rows of any generator matrix in standard form have weight at most &lt;math&gt;n - k + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==History==
The usual citation given for this result is {{harvtxt|Singleton|1964}}, but according to {{harvtxt|Welsh|1988|loc=p. 72}} the result can be found in a 1953 paper of Komamiya.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Y.|last=Komamiya|year=1953|title=Application of logical mathematics to information theory|journal=Proc. 3rd Japan. Nat. Cong. Appl. Math.|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MDS codes==

Linear block codes that achieve equality in the Singleton bound are called '''MDS (maximum distance separable) codes'''. Examples of such codes include codes that have only two codewords (the all-zero word and the all-one word, having thus minimum distance &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;), codes that use the whole of &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{F}_{q})^{n}&lt;/math&gt; (minimum distance 1), codes with a single parity symbol (minimum distance 2) and their [[dual code]]s. These are often called ''trivial'' MDS codes.

In the case of binary alphabets, only trivial MDS codes exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vermani|1996|loc= Proposition 9.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ling|Xing|2004|loc=p. 94 Remark 5.4.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of non-trivial MDS codes include [[Reed–Solomon error correction|Reed-Solomon codes]] and their extended versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacWilliams|Sloane|1977|loc= Ch. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ling|Xing|2004|loc=p. 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDS codes are an important class of block codes since, for a fixed &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, they have the greatest error correcting and detecting capabilities. There are several ways to characterize MDS codes:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roman|1992|loc=p. 237, Theorem 5.3.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Theorem'': Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be a linear &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;n,k,d&lt;/math&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; code over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt;. The following are equivalent:
:* &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is an MDS code.
:* Any &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; columns of a [[generator matrix]] for &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are [[linearly independent]].
:* Any &lt;math&gt;n-k&lt;/math&gt; columns of a [[parity check matrix]] for &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are linearly independent.
:* &lt;math&gt;C^{\perp}&lt;/math&gt; is an MDS code.
:* If &lt;math&gt;G = (I|A)&lt;/math&gt; is a generator matrix for &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; in standard form, then every square submatrix of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[nonsingular]].
:* Given any &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; coordinate positions, there is a (minimum weight) codeword whose [[support (mathematics)|support]] is precisely these positions.

The last of these characterizations permits, by using the [[MacWilliams identities]], an explicit formula for the complete weight distribution of an MDS code.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roman|1992|loc=p. 240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Theorem'': Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; be a linear &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;n,k,d&lt;/math&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; MDS code over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;A_w&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of codewords in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of weight &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, then
::&lt;math&gt;A_w = \binom{n}{w} \sum_{j=0}^{w-d} (-1)^j \binom{w}{j} (q^{w-d+1-j} -1) = \binom{n}{w}(q-1)\sum_{j=0}^{w-d} (-1)^j \binom{w-1}{j}q^{w-d-j}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Arcs in projective geometry===

The linear independence of the columns of a generator matrix of an MDS code permits a construction of MDS codes from objects in [[Finite geometry|finite]] [[projective geometry]]. Let &lt;math&gt;PG(N,q)&lt;/math&gt; be the finite [[projective space]] of (geometric) dimension &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; over the finite field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;K = \{P_1,P_2,\dots,P_m \}&lt;/math&gt; be a set of points in this projective space represented with [[homogeneous coordinates]]. Form the &lt;math&gt;(N+1) \times m&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; whose columns are the homogeneous coordinates of these points. Then,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=A.A.|last1=Bruen|first2=J.A.|last2=Thas|first3=A.|last3=Blokhuis|title=On M.D.S. codes, arcs in PG(n,q), with q even, and a solution of three fundamental problems of B. Segre|journal=Invent. Math.|volume=92|year=1988|pages=441–459|doi=10.1007/bf01393742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Theorem'': &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a (spatial) [[Arc (projective geometry)|&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-arc]] if and only if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the generator matrix of an &lt;math&gt;[m,N+1,m-N]&lt;/math&gt; MDS code over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4322">'''Smooth infinitesimal analysis''' is a modern reformulation of the calculus in terms of [[infinitesimal]]s. Based on the ideas of [[F. W. Lawvere]] and employing the methods of [[category theory]], it views all functions as being [[continuous function|continuous]] and incapable of being expressed in terms of [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]] entities.  As a theory, it is a subset of [[synthetic differential geometry]].

The ''nilsquare'' or ''[[nilpotent]]'' infinitesimals are numbers ''ε'' where ''ε''² = 0 is true, but ''ε'' = 0 need not be true at the same time.

==Overview==
This approach departs from the classical logic used in conventional mathematics by denying the [[law of the excluded middle]], e.g., ''NOT'' (''a'' ≠ ''b'') does not imply ''a'' = ''b''. In particular, in a theory of smooth infinitesimal analysis one can prove for all infinitesimals ''ε'', ''NOT'' (''ε'' ≠ 0); yet it is provably false that all infinitesimals are equal to zero.&lt;ref name=Bell2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=John L.|title=A Primer of Infinitesimal Analysis, 2nd Edition|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521887182}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can see that the law of excluded middle cannot hold from the following basic theorem (again, understood in the context of a theory of smooth infinitesimal analysis):

:''Every function whose domain is ''R'', the real numbers, is continuous and infinitely differentiable.''

Despite this fact, one could attempt to define a discontinuous function ''f''(''x'') by specifying that ''f''(''x'') = 1 for ''x'' = 0, and ''f''(''x'') = 0 for ''x'' ≠ 0. If the law of the excluded middle held, then this would be a fully defined, discontinuous function. However, there are plenty of ''x'', namely the infinitesimals, such that neither ''x'' = 0 nor ''x'' ≠ 0 holds, so the function is not defined on the real numbers.

In typical [[model theory|models]] of smooth infinitesimal analysis, the infinitesimals are not invertible, and therefore the theory does not contain infinite numbers. However, there are also models that include invertible infinitesimals.

Other mathematical systems exist which include infinitesimals, including [[non-standard analysis]] and the [[surreal number]]s. Smooth infinitesimal analysis is like non-standard analysis in that (1) it is meant to serve as a foundation for analysis, and (2) the infinitesimal quantities do not have concrete sizes (as opposed to the surreals, in which a typical infinitesimal is 1/ω, where ω is a von Neumann ordinal). However, smooth infinitesimal analysis differs from non-standard analysis in its use of nonclassical logic, and in lacking the [[transfer principle]]. Some theorems of standard and non-standard analysis are false in smooth infinitesimal analysis, including the [[intermediate value theorem]] and the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]]. Statements in [[non-standard analysis]] can be translated into statements about limits, but the same is not always true in smooth infinitesimal analysis.

Intuitively, smooth infinitesimal analysis can be interpreted as describing a world in which lines are made out of infinitesimally small segments, not out of points. These segments can be thought of as being long enough to have a definite direction, but not long enough to be curved. The construction of discontinuous functions fails because a function is identified with a curve, and the curve cannot be constructed pointwise. We can imagine the intermediate value theorem's failure as resulting from the ability of an infinitesimal segment to straddle a line. Similarly, the Banach–Tarski paradox fails because a volume cannot be taken apart into points.

The '''snake-in-the-box''' problem in [[graph theory]] and [[computer science]] deals with finding a certain kind of path along the edges of a [[hypercube]].  This path starts at one corner and travels along the edges to as many corners as it can reach.  After it gets to a new corner, the previous corner and all of its neighbors must be marked as unusable.  The path should never travel to a corner after it has been marked unusable.

In other words, a ''snake'' is a connected open path in the hypercube where each node in the path, with the exception of the head (start) and the tail (finish), has exactly two neighbors that are also in the snake. The head and the tail each have only one neighbor in the snake. The rule for generating a snake is that a node in the hypercube may be visited if it is connected to the current node and it is not a neighbor of any previously visited node in the snake, other than the current node.

In graph theory terminology, this is called finding the longest possible [[induced path]] in a [[hypercube graph|hypercube]]; it can be viewed as a special case of the [[induced subgraph isomorphism problem]].  There is a similar problem of finding long induced [[cycle graph|cycle]]s in hypercubes, called the '''coil-in-the-box''' problem.

The snake-in-the-box problem was first described by {{harvtxt|Kautz|1958}}, motivated by the theory of [[error-correcting code]]s. The vertices of a solution to the snake or coil in the box problems can be used as a [[Gray code]] that can detect single-bit errors. Such codes have applications in [[electrical engineering]], [[coding theory]], and computer [[network topology|network topologies]]. In these applications, it is important to devise as long a code as is possible for a given dimension of hypercube. The longer the code, the more effective are its capabilities.

Finding the longest snake or coil becomes notoriously difficult as the dimension number increases and the search space suffers a serious [[combinatorial explosion]]. Some techniques for determining the upper and lower bounds for the snake-in-the-box problem include proofs using [[discrete mathematics]] and [[graph theory]], [[exhaustive search]] of the search space, and [[heuristic]] search utilizing evolutionary techniques.

== Known lengths and bounds ==

The maximum length for the snake-in-the-box problem is known for dimensions one through eight; it is
:1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 26, 50, 98 {{OEIS|id=A099155}}.
Beyond that length, the exact length of the longest snake is not known; the best lengths found so far for dimensions nine through thirteen are
:190, 370, 708, 1357, 2687.

For cycles (the coil-in-the-box problem), a cycle cannot exist in a hypercube of dimension less than two. Starting at that dimension, the lengths of the longest possible cycles are
:4, 6, 8, 14, 26, 48, 96 {{OEIS|id=A000937}}.
Beyond that length, the exact length of the longest cycle is not known; the best lengths found so far for dimensions nine through thirteen are
:188, 358, 668, 1340, 2584&lt;!--(&lt;span style="color:crimson;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;: not yet published)--&gt;.

''Doubled coils'' are a special case: cycles whose second half repeats the structure of their first half, also known as ''symmetric coils''. For dimensions two through seven the lengths of the longest possible doubled coils are
:4, 6, 8, 14, 26, 46.
Beyond that, the best lengths found so far for dimensions eight through thirteen are
:94, 186, 362, 662, 1222, 2354.

For both the snake and the coil in the box problems, it is known that the maximum length is proportional to 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for an ''n''-dimensional box, asymptotically as ''n'' grows large, and bounded above by 2&lt;sup&gt;''n-1''&lt;/sup&gt;. However the constant of proportionality is not known, but is observed to be in the range 0.3 - 0.4 for current best known values.&lt;ref&gt;For asymptotic lower bounds, see {{harvtxt|Evdokimov|1969}}, {{harvtxt|Wojciechowski|1989}}, and {{harvtxt|Abbot|Katchalski|1991}}. For upper bounds, see {{harvtxt|Douglas|1969}}, {{harvtxt|Deimer|1985}}, {{harvtxt|Solov'eva|1987}}, {{harvtxt|Abbot|Katchalski|1988}}, {{harvtxt|Snevily|1994}}, and {{harvtxt|Zémor|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8235">In [[noncommutative geometry]] and related branches of [[mathematics]] and [[mathematical physics]], a '''spectral triple''' is a set of data which encodes a geometric phenomenon in an analytic way.  The definition typically involves a [[Hilbert space]], an [[algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] of operators on it and an unbounded [[self-adjoint]] operator, endowed with supplemental structures.  It was conceived by [[Alain Connes]] who was motivated by the [[Atiyah-Singer index theorem]] and sought its extension to 'noncommutative' spaces.  Some authors refer to this notion as '''unbounded [[K-homology|K-cycles]]''' or as '''unbounded [[Fredholm module]]s'''.

== Motivation ==
A motivating example of spectral triple is given by the algebra of smooth functions on a compact [[spin manifold]], acting on the Hilbert space of L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-[[spinor]]s, accompanied by the Dirac operator associated to the spin structure.  From the knowledge of these objects one is able to recover the original manifold as a metric space: the manifold as a topological space is recovered as the spectrum of the algebra, while the (absolute value of) [[Dirac operator]] retains the metric.&lt;ref name="connes94"&gt;A. Connes, Noncommutative Geometry, Academic Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- If we know the 'volume form' we can also recover the smooth structure, which is Connes' reconstruction theorem, but I think this result is too recent. --&gt;  On the other hand, the phase part of the Dirac operator,  in conjunction with the [[function algebra|algebra of functions]], gives a K-cycle which encodes index-theoretic information.  The local index formula&lt;ref&gt;A. Connes, H. Moscovici; The Local Index Formula in Noncommutative Geometry&lt;/ref&gt; expresses the pairing of the K-group of the manifold with this K-cycle in two ways: the 'analytic/global' side involves the usual trace on the Hilbert space and commutators of functions with the phase operator (which corresponds to the 'index' part of the index theorem), while the 'geometric/local' side involves the [[Dixmier trace]] and commutators with the Dirac operator (which corresponds to the 'characteristic class integration' part of the index theorem).

Extensions of the index theorem can be considered in cases, typically when one has an action of a group on the manifold, or when the manifold is endowed with a [[foliation]] structure, among others.  In those cases the algebraic system of the 'functions' which expresses the underlying geometric object is no longer commutative, but one may able to find the space of square integrable spinors (or, sections of a Clifford module) on which the algebra acts, and the corresponding 'Dirac' operator on it satisfying certain boundedness of commutators implied by the pseudo-differential calculus.

== Definition ==
An '''odd spectral triple''' is a triple (A, H, D) consisting of a Hilbert space H, an algebra A of operators on H (usually closed under taking adjoints) and a densely defined self adjoint operator D satisfying &lt;nowiki&gt;‖[a, D]‖ &lt; &amp;infin;&lt;/nowiki&gt; for any a ∈ A.  An '''even spectral triple''' is an odd spectral triple with a '''Z'''/2'''Z'''-grading on H, such that the elements in A are even while D is odd with respect to this grading.  One could also say that an even spectral triple is given by a quartet (A, H, D, γ) such that γ is a self adjoint unitary on H satisfying a γ = γ a for any a in A and D γ = - γ D.

A '''finitely summable''' spectral triple is a spectral triple (A, H, D) such that a.D for any a in A has a compact resolvent which belongs to the class of L&lt;sup&gt;p+&lt;/sup&gt;-operators for a fixed p (when A contains the identity operator on H, it is enough to require D&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in L&lt;sup&gt;p+&lt;/sup&gt;(H)).  When this condition is satisfied, the triple (A, H, D) is said to be '''p-summable'''.  A spectral triple is said to be '''θ-summable''' when e&lt;sup&gt;−tD&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is of trace class for any t &gt; 0.&lt;ref name="connes94"/&gt;

Let δ(T) denote the commutator of |D| with an operator T on H.  A spectral triple is said to be '''regular''' when the elements in A and the operators of the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[a, D]&lt;/nowiki&gt; for a in A are in the domain of the iterates δ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; of δ.

When a spectral triple (A, H, D) is p-summable, one may define its '''zeta function''' ζ&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;(s) = Tr(|D|&lt;sup&gt;−s&lt;/sup&gt;); more generally there are zeta functions ζ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(s) = Tr(b|D|&lt;sup&gt;−s&lt;/sup&gt;) for each element b in the algebra B generated by δ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(A) and δ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;nowiki&gt;[a, D]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) for positive integers n.  They are related to the [[heat kernel]] exp(-t|D|) by a [[Mellin transform]].  The collection of the poles of the analytic continuation of ζ&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; for b in B is called the '''dimension spectrum''' of (A, H, D).

A '''real''' spectral triple is a spectral triple (A, H, D) accompanied with an anti-linear involution J on H, satisfying &lt;nowiki&gt;[a, JbJ] = 0&lt;/nowiki&gt; for a, b in A.  In the even case it is usually assumed that J is even with respect to the grading on H.

== Important concepts ==
Given a spectral triple (A, H, D), one can apply several important operations to it.  The most fundamental one is the [[polar decomposition]] D = F|D| of D into a self adjoint unitary operator F (the 'phase' of D) and a densely defined [[positive operator]] |D| (the 'metric' part).
 
=== Metric on the pure state space ===
The positive |D| operator defines a metric on the set of pure states on the norm closure of A.

=== Pairing with K-theory ===
The self adjoint unitary ''F'' gives a map of the K-theory of ''A'' into integers by taking Fredholm index as follows.  In the even case, each projection ''e'' in ''A'' decomposes as ''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;⊕&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; under the grading and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''Fe''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; becomes a Fredholm operator from ''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''H'' to ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''H''.  Thus&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;Ind&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''Fe''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; defines an additive mapping of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') to '''Z'''.  In the odd case the eigenspace decomposition of ''F'' gives a grading on ''H'', and each invertible&lt;!-- unitary? --&gt; element in ''A'' gives a Fredholm operator (''F''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;u&amp;nbsp;(''F''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/4 from (''F''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)''H'' to (''F''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''H''.  Thus ''u''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;Ind&amp;nbsp;(''F''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;u&amp;nbsp;(''F''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/4 gives an additive mapping from ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') to&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''.

When the spectral triple is finitely summable, one may write the above indexes using the (super) trace, and a product of ''F'', ''e'' (resp.&amp;nbsp;''u'') and commutator of ''F'' with ''e'' (resp.&amp;nbsp;''u'').  This can be encoded as a (''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-functional on ''A'' satisfying some algebraic conditions and give Hochschild / cyclic cohomology cocycles, which describe the above maps from K-theory to the integers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11359">In [[graph theory]], the [[degree diameter problem]] is the problem of finding the largest possible [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] for a given maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] and [[diameter (graph theory)|diameter]].  The [[Moore bound]] sets limits on this, but for many years mathematicians in the field have been interested in a more precise answer.  The table below gives current progress on this problem (excluding the case of degree 2, where the largest graphs are [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]s with an odd number of vertices).

==Table of the orders of the largest known graphs for the undirected degree diameter problem==
Below is the table of the vertex numbers for the best-known graphs (as of October 2008) in the undirected [[degree diameter problem]] for graphs of degree at most 3&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''d''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;16 and diameter 2&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;10. Only a few of the graphs in this table (marked in bold) are known to be optimal (that is, largest possible).  The remainder are merely the largest so far discovered, and thus finding a larger graph that is closer in order (in terms of the size of the vertex set) to the Moore bound is considered an [[open problem]]. Some general constructions are known for values of ''d'' and ''k'' outside the range shown in the table.

'''Time evolution'''  is the change of state brought about by the passage of [[time]], applicable to systems with internal state (also called ''stateful systems''). In this formulation, ''time'' is not required to be a continuous parameter, but may be [[discrete time|discrete]] or even [[wiktionary:finite|finite]].  In [[classical physics]], time evolution of a collection of [[rigid body|rigid bodies]] is governed by the principles of [[classical mechanics]].  In their most rudimentary form, these principles express the relationship between forces acting on the bodies and their acceleration given by [[Newton's laws of motion]]. These principles can also be equivalently expressed more abstractly by [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] or [[Lagrangian mechanics]].

The concept of time evolution may be applicable to other stateful systems as well. For instance, the operation of a [[Turing machine]] can be regarded as the time evolution of the machine's control state together with the state of the tape (or possibly multiple tapes) including the position of the machine's read-write head (or heads).  In this case, time is discrete.

Stateful systems often have dual descriptions in terms of states or in terms of [[observable]] values. In such systems, time evolution can also refer to the change in observable values.  This is particularly relevant in [[quantum mechanics]] where the [[Schrödinger picture]] and [[Heisenberg picture]] are (mostly) equivalent descriptions of time evolution.

== Time evolution operators ==
Consider a system with state space ''X'' for which evolution is [[deterministic]] and [[reversible dynamics|reversible]]. For concreteness let us also suppose time is a parameter that ranges over the set of [[real number]]s '''R'''.   Then time evolution is given by a family of [[Bijection|bijective]] state transformations 

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{F}_{t, s}: X \rightarrow X \quad \forall t,s \in \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;

F&lt;sub&gt;''t'', ''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the state of the system at time ''t'',  whose state at time ''s'' is ''x''.  The following identity holds

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{F}_{u, t} (\operatorname{F}_{t, s} (x)) = \operatorname{F}_{u, s}(x). &lt;/math&gt;

To see why this is true, suppose ''x'' ∈ ''X'' is the state at time ''s''.  Then by the definition of F, F&lt;sub&gt;''t'', ''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the state of the system at time ''t'' and consequently applying the definition once more,  F&lt;sub&gt;''u'', ''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(F&lt;sub&gt;''t'', ''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')) is the state at time ''u''.  But this is also F&lt;sub&gt;''u'', ''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').

In some contexts in mathematical physics, the mappings F&lt;sub&gt;''t'', ''s''&lt;/sub&gt; are called '''propagation operators''' or simply '''[[propagator]]s'''.  In [[classical mechanics]], the propagators are functions that operate on the [[phase space]] of a physical system. In [[quantum mechanics]], the propagators are usually [[unitary operator]]s on a [[Hilbert space]].  The propagators can be expressed as [[time-ordered]] exponentials of the integrated Hamiltonian.  The asymptotic properties of time evolution are given by the [[S-matrix|scattering matrix]].

A state space with a distinguished propagator is also called a [[dynamical system]].

To say time evolution is '''homogeneous''' means that

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{F}_{u, t} = \operatorname{F}_{u - t,0} \quad \forall u,t \in \mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of a homogeneous system, the mappings G&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; = F&lt;sub&gt;''t'',0&lt;/sub&gt; form a one-parameter [[group (mathematics)|group]] of transformations of ''X'', that is

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{G}_{t+s} = \operatorname{G}_{t}\operatorname{G}_{s}. &lt;/math&gt;

'''Non-reversibility'''.   For non-reversible systems, the propagation operators F&lt;sub&gt;''t'', ''s''&lt;/sub&gt; are defined whenever ''t'' ≥ ''s'' and satisfy the propagation identity 

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{F}_{u, t} (\operatorname{F}_{t, s} (x)) = \operatorname{F}_{u, s}(x). \quad u \geq t \geq s. &lt;/math&gt;

In the homogeneous case the propagators are exponentials of the Hamiltonian.

In automata theory, a '''tree''' is a particular way of representing a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree structure]] as sequences of natural numbers. 
[[File:An example of infinite tree structure.png|thumb|500px|alt=The graphic illustration of the example labeled tree|Graphic illustration of the labeled tree described in the example]]
For example, each node of the tree is a [[Formal language#Words over an alphabet|word]] over set of [[natural numbers]] (ℕ), which helps this definition to be used in [[automata theory]].

A '''tree''' is a set ''T'' ⊆ ℕ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; such that if ''t''.''c'' ∈ ''T'', with ''t'' ∈ ℕ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c'' ∈ ℕ, then ''t'' ∈ ''T'' and ''t''.''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''T'' for all 0 ≤ ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''c''. The elements of ''T'' are known as '''nodes''', and the empty word ε is the (single) '''root''' of ''T''. For every ''t'' ∈ ''T'', the element ''t''.''c'' ∈ ''T'' is a '''successor''' of ''t'' in '''direction''' ''c''. The number of successors of ''t'' is called its '''degree''' or '''arity''', and represented as ''d''(''t''). A node is a '''leaf''' if it has no successors. If every node of a tree has finitely many successors, then it is called a '''finitely''', otherwise an '''infinitely branching''' tree. A '''path''' π is a subset of ''T'' such that ε ∈ π and for every ''t'' ∈ ''T'', either ''t'' is a leaf or there exists a unique ''c'' ∈ ℕ such that ''t''.''c'' ∈ π. A path may be a finite or infinite set. If all paths of a tree are finite then the tree is called finite, otherwise infinite. A tree is called '''fully infinite''' if all its paths are infinite. Given an [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] Σ, a '''Σ-labeled tree''' is a pair (''T'',''V''), where ''T'' is a tree and ''V'': ''T'' → Σ maps each node of ''T'' to a symbol in Σ. A labeled tree formally defines a commonly used [[term (logic)|term]] tree structure. A set of labeled trees is called a '''tree language'''.

A tree is called '''ordered''' if there is an order among the successors of each of its nodes. The above definition of tree naturally suggests an order among the successors, which can be used to make the tree ranked. 

In the case of [[ranked alphabet]]s, an extra function ''Ar'': Σ → ℕ is defined. This function associates a fixed arity to each symbol of the alphabet. In this case, each ''t'' ∈ ''T'' has to satisfy ''Ar''(''V''(''t'')) = ''d''(''t''). The trees that satisfy this property are called '''ranked''' trees. The trees that do not (necessarily) satisfy that property are called '''unranked'''.

For example, the above definition is used in the definition of an [[infinite tree automaton]].

==Example==
Let ''T'' = {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and Σ = {''a'',''b''}. We define a labeling function ''V'' as follows: the labeling for the root node is ''V''(ε) = ''a'' and, for every other node ''t'' ∈ {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, the labellings for its successor nodes are ''V''(''t''.0) = ''a'' and ''V''(''t''.1) = ''b''. It is clear from the picture that ''T'' forms a (fully) infinite binary tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9924">In [[abstract algebra]], the '''Weyl algebra''' is the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of [[differential operator]]s with [[polynomial]] coefficients (in one variable), namely expressions of the form

:&lt;math&gt; f_m(X) \partial_X^m + f_{m-1}(X) \partial_X^{m-1} + \cdots + f_1(X) \partial_X + f_0(X).&lt;/math&gt;

More precisely, let ''F'' be the underlying [[field (mathematics)|field]], and let ''F''[''X''] be the [[polynomial ring|ring of polynomials]] in one variable, ''X'', with coefficients in ''F''.  Then each ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' lies in ''F''[''X''].

''∂&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[derivative]] with respect to ''X''.  The algebra is generated by ''X'' and ''∂&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' .

The Weyl algebra is an example of a [[simple ring]] that is not a [[matrix ring]] over a [[division ring]].  It is also a noncommutative example of a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]], and an example of an [[Ore extension]].

The Weyl algebra is isomorphic to the [[quotient ring|quotient]] of the [[free algebra]] on two generators, ''X'' and ''Y'', by the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by the element
:&lt;math&gt;YX - XY - 1~.&lt;/math&gt;

The Weyl algebra is the first in an infinite family of algebras, also known as Weyl algebras.  The '''''n''-th Weyl algebra''', ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', is the ring of differential operators with polynomial coefficients in ''n'' variables.  It is generated by ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''∂&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'', {{nowrap|1=''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''}}.

Weyl algebras are named after [[Hermann Weyl]], who introduced them to study the [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[uncertainty principle]] in [[quantum mechanics]].  It is a [[quotient ring|quotient]] of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of the [[Heisenberg algebra]], the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[Heisenberg group]], by setting the central element of
the Heisenberg algebra (namely [''X'',''Y'']) equal to the unit of the universal enveloping algebra (called 1 above).

The Weyl algebra is also referred to as the '''symplectic Clifford algebra'''.&lt;ref name="helmstetter-2008-p12"&gt;Jacques Helmstetter, Artibano Micali: ''Quadratic Mappings and Clifford Algebras'', Birkhäuser, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-7643-8605-4}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=x_VfARQsSO8C&amp;pg=PR12 p. xii]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ablamowicz-Pxvi"&gt;Rafał Abłamowicz: ''Clifford algebras: applications to mathematics, physics, and engineering'' (dedicated to Pertti Lounesto), Progress in Mathematical Physics, Birkhäuser Boston, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8176-3525-4}}.

Sitarczyk: ''Parallel treatment of Riemannian and symplectic Clifford algebras'', pp. 83–96. In: Artibano Micali, Roger Boudet, Jacques Helmstetter (eds.): ''Clifford algebras and their applications in mathematical physics'', Kluwer, 1989, {{ISBN|0-7923-1623-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FhU9QpPIscoC&amp;pg=PA92 p. 92]&lt;/ref&gt; Weyl algebras represent the same structure for symplectic [[bilinear form]]s that [[Clifford algebra]]s represent for non-degenerate symmetric bilinear forms.&lt;ref name="helmstetter-2008-p12"/&gt;

== Generators and relations ==
One may give an abstract construction of the algebras ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in terms of generators and relations. Start with an abstract [[vector space]] ''V'' (of dimension 2''n'') equipped with a [[symplectic form]] ''ω''. Define the Weyl algebra ''W''(''V'') to be

:&lt;math&gt;W(V) := T(V) / (\!( v \otimes u - u \otimes v - \omega(v,u), \text{ for } v,u \in V )\!),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T''(''V'') is the [[tensor algebra]] on ''V'', and  the notation &lt;math&gt;(\!( )\!)&lt;/math&gt; means "the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by".

In other words, ''W''(''V'') is the algebra generated by ''V'' subject only to the relation {{math|''vu'' − ''uv'' {{=}} ''ω''(''v'', ''u'')}}. Then, ''W''(''V'') is isomorphic to ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' via the choice of a Darboux basis for {{mvar|ω}}.

=== Quantization ===
The algebra ''W''(''V'') is a [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of the [[symmetric algebra]] Sym(''V'').  If ''V'' is over a field of characteristic zero, then ''W''(''V'') is naturally isomorphic to the underlying vector space of the [[symmetric algebra]] Sym(''V'') equipped with a deformed product – called the Groenewold–[[Moyal product]] (considering the symmetric algebra to be polynomial functions on ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, where the variables span the vector space ''V'', and replacing ''iħ''  in the Moyal product formula with 1).

The isomorphism is given by the symmetrization map from Sym(''V'') to ''W''(''V'')
:&lt;math&gt;a_1 \cdots a_n \mapsto \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} a_{\sigma(1)} \otimes \cdots \otimes a_{\sigma(n)}~.&lt;/math&gt;

If one prefers to have the ''iħ'' and work over the complex numbers, one could have instead defined the Weyl algebra above as generated by ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''iħ∂&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''  (as per [[quantum mechanics]] usage).

Thus, the Weyl algebra is a quantization of the symmetric algebra, which is essentially the same as the [[Moyal product|Moyal quantization]] (if for the latter one restricts to polynomial functions), but the former is in terms of generators and relations (considered to be differential operators) and the latter is in terms of a deformed multiplication.

In the case of [[exterior algebra]]s, the analogous quantization to the Weyl one is the [[Clifford algebra]], which is also referred to as the ''orthogonal Clifford algebra''.&lt;ref name="ablamowicz-Pxvi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Z. Oziewicz, Cz. Sitarczyk: ''Parallel treatment of Riemannian and symplectic Clifford algebras'', pp. 83–96. In: Artibano Micali, Roger Boudet, Jacques Helmstetter (eds.): ''Clifford algebras and their applications in mathematical physics'', Kluwer, 1989, {{ISBN|0-7923-1623-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FhU9QpPIscoC&amp;pg=PA83 p. 83]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties of the Weyl algebra==
{{further|Stone–von Neumann theorem}}
In the case that the ground field {{mvar|F}} has characteristic zero, the ''n''th Weyl algebra is a [[simple ring|simple]] [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[domain (ring theory)|domain]].  It has [[global dimension]] ''n'', in contrast to the ring it deforms, Sym(''V''), which has global dimension 2''n''.

It has no finite-dimensional representations. Although this follows from simplicity, it can be more directly shown by taking the trace ''σ''(''X'') and ''σ''(''Y'') for some finite-dimensional representation ''σ'' (where {{nowrap|1=[''X'',''Y''] = 1}}).
:&lt;math&gt; tr([\sigma(X),\sigma(Y)])=tr(1)~.&lt;/math&gt;
Since the trace of a commutator is zero, and the trace of the identity is the dimension of the matrix, the representation must be zero dimensional.

In fact, there are stronger statements than the absence of finite-dimensional representations.  To any finitely generated ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''-module ''M'', there is a corresponding subvariety Char(''M'') of {{nowrap|''V'' × ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} called the 'characteristic variety'{{what|date=August 2016}} whose size roughly corresponds to the size{{what|date=August 2016}} of ''M'' (a finite-dimensional module would have zero-dimensional characteristic variety).  Then [[Bernstein's inequality (mathematical analysis)|Bernstein's inequality]] states that for ''M'' non-zero,
:&lt;math&gt;\dim(\operatorname{char}(M))\geq n&lt;/math&gt;
An even stronger statement is [[Gabber's theorem]], which states that Char(''M'') is a [[Lagrangian submanifold|co-isotropic]] subvariety of {{nowrap|''V'' × ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} for the natural symplectic form.

===Positive characteristic===
The situation is considerably different in the case of a Weyl algebra over a field of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] {{nowrap|''p'' &gt; 0}}.

In this case, for any element ''D'' of the Weyl algebra, the element ''D&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' is central, and so the Weyl algebra has a very large center.  In fact, it is a finitely generated module over its center; even more so, it is an [[Azumaya algebra]] over its center.  As a consequence, there are many finite-dimensional representations which are all built out of simple representations of dimension ''p''.

== Generalizations ==
For more details about this quantization in the case ''n'' = 1 (and an extension using the [[Fourier transform]] to a class of integrable functions larger than the polynomial functions), see [[Wigner–Weyl transform]].

Weyl algebras and Clifford algebras admit a further structure of a [[*-algebra]], and can be unified as even and odd terms of a [[superalgebra]], as discussed in [[CCR and CAR algebras]].

=== Affine Varieties ===
Weyl algebras also generalize in the case of algebraic varieties. Consider a polynomial ring
:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]}{I} &lt;/math&gt;
then a differential operator is defined as a composition &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;-linear derivations of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. This can be described explicitly as the quotient ring
:&lt;math&gt; \text{Diff}(R) = \frac{\{ D \in A_n : D(I) \subseteq I \}}{ I\cdot A_n}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5942">'''Winifred Margaret Deans''' (9 October 1901 – 7 June 1990) was a prolific translator of German scientific texts into English, who also taught mathematics and physics to secondary schoolchildren and worked at the Commonwealth Bureau of Animal Nutrition.&lt;ref name="“primesrc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deans’ Biography|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Deans.html|publisher=University of St Andrews, Scotland|accessdate=26 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and education ==
Deans was one of two siblings, born to Duncan Deans and Mary Ann Sharp, in [[New Milton]], [[Hampshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. She graduated with an M.A. with First Class Honours in Mathematics from the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1922. She also obtained a B. Sc. from the same university in 1923. She later studied at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], obtaining a First Class B.A. after she took Part I of the [[Mathematical Tripos]] in 1925. She earned another M.A, from Cambridge, in 1929.&lt;ref name="“family"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Sharp Family of Aberdeenshire|url=http://www.carsontree.talktalk.net/Sharp/Sharp.htm|publisher=Robert Carson|accessdate=26 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Deans won several awards in the course of her education, the University of Aberdeen awarding her the Simpson mathematical prize and the [[Neil Arnott]] prize for experimental physics in 1921; she also stood first in the examination for the Greig prize in natural philosophy.&lt;ref name="“aurvw"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Internet Archive's copy of Aberdeen University Review Vol IX|url=https://archive.org/stream/aberdeenuniversi09univuoft#page/264/mode/2up|publisher=Aberdeen University Press|accessdate=26 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Work ==
Deans taught mathematics and physics at the Harrow County Secondary School for Girls for two years. She then returned to Aberdeen and received a Diploma in Education in 1927. She joined [[Blackie and Son]], a publishing house in [[Glasgow]] as an Assistant Science Editor. She began translating German publications, primarily related to Physics and Mathematics, for them. Important translations included those of texts by [[Max Born]], [[Léon Brillouin]], [[Louis de Broglie]], [[Peter Debye]], [[Richard Gans]], [[Robert Pohl]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger]]. She also translated Else Wegener and Fritz Loewe's chronicle of [[Alfred Wegener]]’s fourth expedition to Greenland, undertaken in 1930–31.

Deans joined the Commonwealth Bureau of Animal Nutrition which was part of the [[Rowett Research Institute]], Aberdeen, in 1945. She retired from the bureau in 1966.

Deans’ library and personal papers were given to the University of Aberdeen, and can now be found in their Special Collections, Library and Archives.

In 4-dimensional complex [[geometry]], the '''Witting polytope''' is a [[regular complex polytope]], named as: &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[Coxeter diagram]] {{CDD|3node_1|3|3node|3|3node|3|3node}}. It has 240 vertices, 2160 &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{} edges, 2160 [[Möbius–Kantor polygon|&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] faces, and 240 [[Hessian polyhedron|&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] cells. It is self-dual. Each vertex belongs to 27 edges, 72 faces, and 27 cells, corresponding to the [[Hessian polyhedron]] [[vertex figure]].

== Symmetry==
Its symmetry by &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[3]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or {{CDD|3node|3|3node|3|3node|3|3node}}, order 155,520.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter Regular Convex Polytopes, 12.5 The Witting polytope&lt;/ref&gt; It has 240 copies of {{CDD|3node|3|3node|3|3node}}, order 648 at each cell.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, Complex Regular Polytopes, p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure==
The [[Configuration (polytope)|configuation matrix]] is:&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, Complex Regular polytopes, p.132&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left [\begin{smallmatrix}240&amp;27&amp;72&amp;27\\3&amp;2160&amp;8&amp;8\\8&amp;8&amp;2160&amp;3\\27&amp;72&amp;27&amp;240\end{smallmatrix}\right ]&lt;/math&gt;

The number of vertices, edges, faces, and cells are seen in the diagonal of the matrix. These are computed by the order of the group divided by the order of the subgroup, by removing certain complex reflections, shown with X below. The number of elements of the k-faces are seen in rows below the diagonal. The number of elements in the vertex figure, etc, are given in rows above the digonal.

|}

== Coordinates==
Its 240 vertices are given coordinates in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^4&lt;/math&gt;: 
{| class=wikitable
|
: (0, ±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;/sup&gt;, -±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nu;&lt;/sup&gt;, ±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sup&gt;) 
: (-±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;/sup&gt;, 0, ±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nu;&lt;/sup&gt;, ±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sup&gt;)
: (±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;/sup&gt;, -±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nu;&lt;/sup&gt;, 0, ±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sup&gt;) 
: (-±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sup&gt;, -±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;/sup&gt;, -±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nu;&lt;/sup&gt;, 0) 
|
: (±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sup&gt;√3, 0, 0, 0) 
: (0, ±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sup&gt;√3, 0, 0) 
: (0, 0, ±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sup&gt;√3, 0) 
: (0, 0, 0, ±&amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sup&gt;√3) 
|}

where &lt;math&gt;\omega = \tfrac{-1+i\sqrt3}{2}, \lambda, \nu, \mu = 0,1,2&lt;/math&gt;.

The last 6 points form hexagonal ''holes'' on one of its 40 diameters. There are 40 [[hyperplane]]s contain central [[Hessian polyhedron#Related complex polyhedra|&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{4}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], {{CDD|3node_1|3|3node|4|node}} figures, with 72 vertices.

== Witting configuration ==
Coxeter named it after [[Alexander Witting]] for being a ''Witting [[Configuration (polytope)|configuration]]'' in complex projective 3-space:&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Witting, Ueber Jacobi'sche Functionen k&lt;sup&gt;ter&lt;/sup&gt; Ordnung Zweier Variabler, Mathemematische Annalen 29 (1887), 157-70, see especially p.169&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left [\begin{smallmatrix} 40&amp;12&amp;12\\2&amp;240&amp;2\\12&amp;12&amp;40 \end{smallmatrix}\right ]&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\left [\begin{smallmatrix} 40&amp;9&amp;12\\4&amp;90&amp;4\\12&amp;9&amp;40 \end{smallmatrix}\right ]&lt;/math&gt;

The Witting configuration is related to the finite space PG(3,2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), consisting of 85 points, 357 lines, and 85 planes.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, Complex regular polytopes, p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related real polytope==
Its 240 vertices are shared with the real 8-dimensional polytope [[4 21 polytope|4&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;]], {{CDD|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|branch|3a|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|nodea_1}}. Its 2160 3-edges are sometimes drawn as 6480 simple edges, slightly less than the 6720 edges of 4&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;. The 240 difference is accounted by 40 central hexagons in 4&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; whose edges are not included in &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, Complex Regular Polytopes, p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

== The honeycomb of Witting polytopes ==

The regular Witting polytope has one further stage as a [[Complex_polytope#Regular_complex_4-apeirotopes|4-dimensional honeycomb]], {{CDD|3node_1|3|3node|3|3node|3|3node|3|3node}}. It has the Witting polytope as both its facets, and vertex figure. It is self-dual, and its dual coincides with itself.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, Complex Regular Polytopes, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperplane sections of this honeycomb include 3-dimensional honeycombs {{CDD|3node_1|3|3node|3|3node|4|node}}.

The honeycomb of Witting polytopes has a real representation as the 8-dimensional polytope [[5 21 honeycomb|5&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;]], {{CDD|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|branch|3a|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|nodea|3a|nodea_1}}.

Its [[f-vector]] element counts are in proportion: 1, 80, 270, 80, 1.&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter Regular Convex Polytopes, 12.5 The Witting polytope&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Configuration (polytope)|configuration matrix]] for the honeycomb is:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1350">'''Zimmer's conjecture''' is a statement in [[mathematics]] "which has to do with the circumstances under which [[geometric space]]s exhibit certain kinds of [[Symmetry|symmetries]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-proof-about-where-symmetries-cant-exist-20181023/|title=A Proof About Where Symmetries Can’t Exist|last=Hartnett|first=Kevin|date=2018-10-23|work=Quanta Magazine|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after the mathematician [[Robert Zimmer]].  The conjecture states that there can exist symmetries (specifically [[higher-rank lattice]]s) in a higher dimension that cannot exist in lower dimensions.

In 2017, the conjecture was proven by Aaron Brown and Sebastian Hurtado-Salazar of the [[University of Chicago]] and David Fisher of [[Indiana University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Brown|first=Aaron|last2=Fisher|first2=David|last3=Hurtado|first3=Sebastian|date=2017-10-07|title=Zimmer's conjecture for actions of SL(𝑚,ℤ)|eprint=1710.02735|class=math.DS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/new-methods-for-zimmers-conjecture/|title=New Methods for Zimmer's Conjecture|work=IPAM|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
