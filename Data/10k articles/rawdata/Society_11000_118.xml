The '''1977 Bogra mutiny''' was a [[mutiny]] in [[Bogra Cantonment]] on 30 September 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rahman |first1=Syedur |year=2010 |title=Historical Dictionary of Bangladesh |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bJfcCPUr0OoC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Bogra+mutiny+started+on+30+September+1977#v=onepage&amp;q=Bogra%20mutiny%20started%20on%2030%20September%201977&amp;f=false |publisher=Scarecrow Press |pages=55 |isbn=9780810874534 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepoy Unrest in Bogra|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1977DACCA05569_c.html|website=wikileaks.org |date=1 October 1977 |access-date=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Ziaur Rahman]] was the chief of Army Staff, he served as the chief Martial law administrator after the [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]]. On 21 April 1977 President [[Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem]] resigned and Zia became president of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahamed|first1=Emajuddin|title=Rahman, Shahid Ziaur|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Rahman,_Shahid_Ziaur|website=en.banglapedia.org|publisher=Banglapedia|access-date=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ziaur Rahman president of Bangladesh|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ziaur-Rahman|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1977 the Bogra cantonment saw another mutiny which led to the mutinous unit being disbanded.

==Events==
The mutiny took place in Bogra cantonment under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Zaman. The government of Bangladesh was preoccupied with [[Japan Airlines Flight 472 (1977)|Japan Airlines Flight 472]] which was hijacked and had landed in Dhaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roy |first1=Asish Kumar |year=2002 |title=Praetorian politics in Bangladesh, 1975-1981 |publisher=Progressive Publishers |pages=78, 207 |oclc=491399557 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enlisted men had killed their officers and there were reports of gunfire in Bogra town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh Mutiny|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1977DACCA05677_c.html|website=wikileaks.org |date=4 October 1977 |access-date=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 22nd [[Bengal Regiment]] had mutinied.

{{Use South African English|date=May 2013}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}

'''Afrikaner nationalism''' is a political ideology that was born in the late nineteenth century among [[Afrikaner]]s in [[South Africa]]. It was  strongly influenced by [[anti-British sentiment]]s that grew strong among the Afrikaners, especially because of the [[Boer Wars]].&lt;ref name="encarta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761584031/Afrikaner_Nationalism.html |title=Afrikaner Nationalism – MSN Encarta |work= |accessdate= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDWgFJX?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761584031/Afrikaner_Nationalism.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian T. Dunbar Moodie, Afrikaner nationalism could be described as a kind of [[civil religion]] that combined the history of the Afrikaners, the formalised language (Afrikaans) and [[Afrikaner Calvinism]] as key symbols. A major proponent of the ideology was the secret ''[[Broederbond]]'' organisation and the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] that ruled the country from 1948 to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/8334/Apartheid-Rise-Afrikaner-Nationalism.html |title=Apartheid – Rise of Afrikaner Nationalism |accessdate=2008-10-01 |publisher=Net Industries | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081010233556/http://science.jrank.org/pages/8334/Apartheid-Rise-Afrikaner-Nationalism.html| archivedate= 10 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisations aligned with Afrikaner nationalist ideology were the Federation of Afrikaans Cultural Organisations (''[[Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge]]'', FAK), the Institute for Christian National Education and the White Workers' Protection Association.&lt;ref name="louw"/&gt;

== Formulating the ideology ==
One of the first champions of Afrikaner nationalism was ordained minister [[Stephen Du Toit]] of the [[Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk|Dutch Reformed Church]], who was also one of the founding members of the ''Broederbond'' as well as the publisher of ''[[Die Afrikaanse Patriot]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="encarta"/&gt; In his writings, Du Toit put forward the notion that [[Afrikaners]] were a distinct nationality with a fatherland ([[South Africa]]) and their own language ([[Afrikaans]]) and that the ''volk's'' destiny was to rule South Africa.&lt;ref name="encarta2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761584059/S_J_Du_Toit.html |title=S.

=== Dutch Reformed Church ===
[[File:Abraham Kuyper.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abraham Kuyper]], the Dutch [[neo-Calvinist]] theologian]]

Religion, especially Afrikaner Calvinism, played an instrumental role in the development of Afrikaner nationalism and consequently the apartheid ideology. The Dutch Reformed Churches of South Africa were involved throughout the 18th&amp;nbsp;century in a constant battle against [[modernism]] and [[modernity]]. They aligned with the conservative views of [[Abraham Kuyper]], who emphasised God's authority over separate [[Sphere sovereignty|spheres]] of creation. These spheres, for example historical nations, had to be preserved and protected from liberalism and revolutionary ideologies.&lt;ref name="cambridge"&gt;{{ cite book | last = Clark | first = Desmond J| authorlink = |author2=J. D. Fage|author3=Roland Anthony Oliver|author4=A. D. Roberts  | title =The Cambridge History of Africa| publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1975 | location = | pages =564–565 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=HIA2m4m8KNgC| doi = | id = | isbn = 0-521-22505-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuyper also rejected the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] with its emphasis on human rationality and individuality and thought that it had led to the ideals of equality, fraternity and freedom of the [[French Revolution]]. In his view, all these ideas challenged God's authority.&lt;ref name="mills"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stmarys.ca/~wmills/course322/14aReligion_natm.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051931/http://stmarys.ca/~wmills/course322/14aReligion_natm.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-28 |title=Wallace G. Mills Hist. 322 14a Religion and Afrikaner Nationalism |work= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afrikaner theologians worked from this foundation and defined a number of political, economic and cultural spheres that had their separate, independent destinies.&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt; The Afrikaner history was also reinterpreted through a Christian-nationalistic ideology. Already [[Paul Kruger]], president of [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and a founding member of the ''Gereformeerde Kerke van Zuid-Afrika'' or 'Dopper Church', referred to it as "sacred history" with ''volk'' as the chosen people, where the [[Great Trek]] was seen as the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from the British rule in [[Cape Colony|Cape]] to the Promised Land of the Boer Republics.&lt;ref name="prozesky"&gt;{{ cite book | last = Prozesky | first =Martin | authorlink = |author2= John De Gruchy | title =Living faiths in South Africa | publisher =C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers | year = 1995 | location = | pages =27–55 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=b8-glmO65Y0C| doi = | id = | isbn = 1-85065-244-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secular Afrikaner nationalism ===
During the 1930s and 1940s many intellectuals partook in the theoretical formulation of Afrikaner nationalism. [[Nicolaas Johannes Diederichs]], who later became South Africa's [[State President of South Africa|president]], formulated Afrikaner nationalistic ideology in his book ''"Nationalism as a Worldview and Its Relationship to Internationalism"'' through Kuyperian theology. According to Diederichs, God created nations and these nations had a God-ordained [[right to exist]] as separate entities. Therefore, Afrikaners could refuse a "British-designed" South Africa in which they would co-exist with other ethnic groups as a minority.&lt;ref name="louw"&gt;{{ cite book | last = Louw | first =P. Eric | authorlink = | title = The Rise, Fall, and Legacy of Apartheid | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 2004 | location = | pages =27–55 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=7XTgSQ4bUOkC| doi = | id = | isbn = 0-275-98311-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrey Cronje developed these ideas further and argued, that as long as the Afrikaner existed as a minority in a racially and culturally different environment, they could not allow the black majority to develop economically or politically, since this would lead to black domination. He acknowledged this as unjust and unchristian, and as a solution offered total segregation, that is [[apartheid]], between the blacks and the whites.&lt;ref name="louw"/&gt;

The Afrikaner nationalist intelligentsia, along with the National Party and the ''Broederbond'', ended up formulating a radical nationalistic policy which rejected British hegemony in economics and politics as well as ethnic ''mengelmoes'' ("mess") induced by the transportation of black migrant workers around the country. Their solution was a drastic reordering of the South African demographic map with a dominant Afrikaner Republic not influenced by British imperialism. However, because of the opposition of the urban middle class they did not propose a return to conservative, pre-modern [[Boer]] [[pastoralism]].&lt;ref name="louw"/&gt;

=== Afrikaner nationalism and race ===
Initially during the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, the position of the Dutch Reformed Church on the nationalist issue was more pragmatic than ideological and, for example, in South Africa, racial segregation was accepted as a harmonious way of administering heterogeneous community. The economic depression in 1905–09 changed this attitude when a new group of "poor whites", mostly Afrikaners, emerged.&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt; By 1939 the racial segregation had been made into a church dogma: 
:"The policy of segregation as advocated by the Afrikaner and his church is the holy calling of the Church to see to the thousands of poor whites in the cities who fight a losing battle in the present economic world...The application of segregation will furthermore lead to the creation of separate healthy cities for the non-whites where they will be in a position to develop along their own lines, establish their own institutions and later on govern themselves under the guardianship of the whites"&lt;ref name="mills"/&gt;

The Afrikaner state as a Christian civilisation thus had a divine right to stay separate and rule the surrounding "[[Paganism#Heathen|heathen]]" nations.&lt;ref name="prozesky"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Saul|last=Dubow |authorlink=Saul Dubow |year=1992|title=Afrikaner Nationalism, Apartheid and the Conceptualization of ‘Race’. |journal=The Journal of African History|volume==33|pages=209–237|doi=10.1017/S0021853700032217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Afrikaner nationalism and national socialism ===
Afrikaner nationalism and [[Nazism]] had common roots in religio-nationalism and Pan Germanism and therefore the racist elements of the former were easily assimilated into the earlier.{{cn|date=April 2017}} For example, Afrikaner criticism of the capitalistic system inter-war period was quite anti-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxwagon Sentinel: Radical Afrikaner Nationalism and the History of the Ossewabrandwag|first=
Christoph|last=Marx|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise of the South Africa Reich|first=B.|last=Bunting|publisher=Harmondsworth, London|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Afrikaner nationalists also viewed a Nazi German style strong government as necessary to protect the ''volk''. Just before, and during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], these sentiments led to the appearance of a number of pro-Nazi Afrikaner nationalistic organisations, such as the ''[[Ossewabrandwag]]'' and its paramilitary wing ''Stormjaers''.&lt;ref name="mills2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stmarys.ca/~wmills/course322/14bLater_natm.html |title=Wallace G.

=== ''Broederbond''  ===
[[File:Broederbond.jpg|thumb|left|[[Afrikaner Broederbond]] leadership in 1918]]

During the 1930s a group of ''[[Afrikaner Broederbond|Broederbond]]'' members shaped the Afrikaner nationalistic ideology, by trying to create a common "Christian-nationalistic" identity for all white, Afrikaans speaking South Africans as well as introducing the idea of ''Volkskapitalisme'' (people's capitalism) that tried to take control from the "British" or "Jewish"  foreign economic system and to adapt it to Afrikaner's national character.&lt;ref name="meara"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.uct.ac.za/misc/wolpe/meara.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20081010190303/http://web.uct.ac.za/misc/wolpe/meara.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 10, 2008 |title=THINKING THEORETICALLY? |accessdate=2008-10-01 |last=O'Meara |first=Dan |date=1–2 April 1997 |work=Paper presented to the Inaugural Conference of the Harold Wolpe Memorial Trust }}: ''"...responding to the 'pauperisation and domination' of Afrikaners by what the interpreters variously labelled as the 'British' or 'Jewish' 'capitalistic system', volkskapitalisme explicitly set out to "mobilise the volk to capture control of this foreign [capitalist] system and adapt it to our national character". This boiled down to a concerted programme to mobilise the savings of the volk to finance existing and new Afrikaner undertakings."''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Volkskapitalisme'' strived to improve the economic conditions of the Afrikaners who in general at the time were less well-off than the English-speaking whites in South Africa. In practice the program consisted of utilising the Afrikaner capital into new and existing Afrikaner businesses. Although ''volkskapitalisme ''managed to develop some Afrikaner businesses, such as [[Sanlam]] and [[Volkskas]] into corporate giants that still have a central role in [[Economy of South Africa|South African economy]], in the end the economic benefits for the majority of the poor Afrikaners were slim.&lt;ref name="meara"/&gt;

Despite the efforts of the ''Broederbond'' activists to "Afrikanerise" South Africa, the uptake of this new Christian-nationalistic Afrikaner identity was slow and unenthusiastic. According to electoral studies, the majority of the target group (white, Afrikaans speaking South Africans) did not vote for the Afrikaner nationalistic National Party until the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="meara"/&gt;

=== Popular media ===
During the 1930s and 1940s Afrikaner nationalists constructed an "[[imagined community]]" of the Afrikaner with maps and narratives of its heroic past, moral purpose and a place among other nations. These ideas were spread through new emerging Afrikaner print media, such as the Christian-nationalistic journal ''Koers'' (Direction) and a more popularised ''Inspan'', magazines such as ''Huisgenoot'', books published by the ''Burger Boekhandel'' publishing house and the newspapers ''[[Die Burger]]'', ''Transvaler'' and ''[[Volksblad]]''.&lt;ref name="louw"/&gt; The usage of Afrikaans instead of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] was aggressively promoted throughout the 1920s especially in white schools.&lt;ref name="afrikaans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about-south-africa.com/html/afrikaans.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060703113248/http://about-south-africa.com/html/afrikaans.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-07-03 |title=The Origin and History of the Afrikaans Language|accessdate=2008-10-03 |last=|first= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible was translated into Afrikaans by [[Totius (poet)|J.&amp;nbsp;D.&amp;nbsp;du&amp;nbsp;Toit]], E.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;van&amp;nbsp;Rooyen, J.&amp;nbsp;D.&amp;nbsp;Kestell, H.&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;Fourie, and [[BB&amp;nbsp;Keet]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enigstetroos.org/bybelstudie.htm|title=Bybelstudies|accessdate=2008-09-23|last=Bogaards|first=Attie H.|language=af| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081010173208/http://www.enigstetroos.org/bybelstudie.htm| archivedate= 10 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Rise to power ===
The South African opposition during the World War&amp;nbsp;II of the country's involvement in the war against [[Nazi Germany]] led to the National Party's rise to power in the 1948&amp;nbsp;elections, to the implementation of the [[apartheid]] politics in the country and finally to the culmination of Afrikaner nationalistic mobilisation in 1961 when the country resigned from the [[British Commonwealth]] and became a republic.&lt;ref name="HSRC"/&gt; The National Party government implemented, alongside apartheid, a program of social conservatism. Pornography, gambling, and other such vices were banned because they were thought to be elements contrary to the "Afrikaner way of life".&lt;ref name="mills2" /&gt; Even adultery and attempted adultery were banned (by the Immorality Amendment Act, Act No&amp;nbsp;23 of 1957).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/general/1950s.html|title=General South African History Timeline: 1950s|first=|last=Anonymous|date=4 April 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emerging conflicts ===
During the 1960s a split emerged in the Afrikaner electorate over the issue of how to preserve a distinct identity in a multi-ethnic society: one faction insisted on preserving the national identity through strict isolation, while others thought that such barriers needed to be relaxed. As a sign of this, in the 1970&amp;nbsp;election a radical splinter group from the National Party, [[Herstigte Nasionale Party]], got 3.59% of the vote compared to the National Party's 54.86%. The gulf widened further during the 1980s partly because of the international pressure against apartheid.&lt;ref name="HSRC"/&gt;

One notable Afrikaner nationalist organisation was the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]]&amp;nbsp;(AWB), a political and former paramilitary group. The group had the support of an estimated 5–7 percent of white South Africans in 1988.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/28/world/rightists-rally-in-pretoria-urging-a-white-state.html| title=Rightists Rally in Pretoria, Urging a White State | publisher=New York Times| date =22 February 1988 | first=John D. | last=Battersby | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was beset by personal and militant scandals in the late 1980s and early 1990s that led to diminished support. This organisation was however never able to garner substantial Afrikaner support, which was held by the National Party until its dissolution.

In the 1990s the National Party acknowledged the failure of its ethnic project and under the leadership of [[F.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;De&amp;nbsp;Klerk]] dismantled the political system set up from 1948. After apartheid, Afrikaner nationalism has lost most of its support.&lt;ref name="meara"/&gt;

=== After apartheid ===

Although it has mostly disappeared from publicity, Afrikaner nationalism is kept alive through such political initiatives as the ''Cyber Republic of the Boer Nation'', which claims to be "the only white indigenous tribe in Southern Africa" and has tried to appeal to the UN [[Working Group on Indigenous Populations]] for the protection of cultural, linguistic and religious rights of people around the world.&lt;ref name="chidester"&gt;{{ cite book | last = Chidester| first = David| authorlink2 =Phillip Dexter |author2=Phillip Dexter|author3=Wilmot Godfrey James|authorlink3 =Wilmot James | title =What Holds Us Together: Social Cohesion in South Africa | publisher = HSRC Press | year = 2004| location = | pages =305–306 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=__ycVguikuQC| doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7969-2030-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also some marginal right wing political parties, such as the [[Herstigte Nasionale Party]], still declare their goal to be the "unashamed promotion of Afrikaner nationalism".&lt;ref name="die afrikaner"&gt;Basson J: ''Die Afrikaner – mondstuk van die nasionalistiese Afrikaner'', Strydpers Bpk,{{cite web|url=http://www.hnp.org.za/afrikaner/inligting.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610002221/http://www.hnp.org.za/afrikaner/inligting.htm |archivedate=10 June 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Front National (South Africa)]]; a political party in South Africa has also emerged in the post-apartheid years harbouring Afrikaner Nationalism. The party is linked to ''[[South Africa Today]]'' a media outlet that reports about [[South African farm attacks]] and other things that affect white South Africans.

The tradition of Christian-national education is continued by the [[BCVO|Movement for Christian-National Education]] ({{lang-af|Beweging vir Christelik-Volkseie Onderwys}}) which educates the youth of the [[Boere-Afrikaner]] ''volk'' in the Afrikaner Calvinist tradition, Boer culture and history as well as in Afrikaans language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcvo.co.za/skl/skl_index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926105058/http://www.bcvo.co.za/skl/skl_index.htm |archivedate=26 September 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] had been largely inactive in South Africa since the demise of apartheid, although in 2008, the organisation was reactivated and is actively seeking an Afrikaner secessionist state within South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/2059457/South-Africa-AWB-leader-Terre'Blanche-rallys-Boers-again.html| title=AWB leader Terre'Blanche rallies Boers again| publisher=The Telegraph | date=1 June 2008 | location=London | first=Stephen | last=Bevan | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 April 2010, [[Eugene Terre'Blanche]], leader of the AWB, was murdered on his farm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/04/eugene-terreblanche-south-african-white-supremacist White supremacist Eugene Terre'Blanche is hacked to death after row with farmworkers] The Guardian. 4 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Assamese people''' are the indigenous people of the state of [[Assam]]. They are a physically diverse group formed after years of assimilation of [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]], [[Indo-Aryan migration to Assam|Indo-Aryan]], [[Tibeto-Burman and Tai peoples of Assam|Tibeto-Burman and Tai]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p9PkFF3uq_8C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;d |title=Fragmented Memories |author=Yasmin Saikia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total population of [[Assamese language|native Assamese speakers]] in [[Assam]] is nearly 13 million which makes up 48.8% of the  population of Assam according to the ''Language census of 2001''. Though there is a political dispute over the definition of Assamese people in Assam, in general; the people belonging to the state of Assam along with belonging to an indigenous community of Assam and speaking the Assamese language or any other language of Assam as his/her first language are referred as Assamese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assamese-people-definition-rocks-assembly/article7055297.ece|title=Assamese People” definition rocks Assembly, ''The Hindu''|work=Special Correspondent|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The indigenous Assamese people traditionally include ethnic groups like [[Assamese Brahmins]] (including [[Ganak]]s), [[Koch Rajbongshi|Koch Rajbongshis]], [[Ahoms]], [[Deori people|Deoris]], [[Sonowal Kacharis|Sonowal–Kachari]]s, [[Rabha|Rabhas]], [[Hajong people|Hajongs]], [[Bodo people|Bodo]], [[Mishing people|Mishings]], [[Kayastha|Assamese Kayasthas]], [[Kalitas of Assam|Kalita]]s,[Chutiya people|Chutias]], , [[Jalia Kaibarta|Keot(Kaibarta)]], [[Baro-Bhuyan]], [[Mech tribe|Mech Kacharis]], [[Thengal-Kachari|Thengal–Kacharis]], [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwas]], [[Sarania Kachari|Sarania Kacharis]],  [[Nath]], [[Kumar]], Hira, [[Tai Phake people|Tai-Phake]], [[Tai Aiton people|Tai-Aiton]], [[Khamyang people|Tai-Khamyangs]], [[Khamti people|Tai-Khamti]], [[Turung people|Tai-Turung]], other Tai groups, Moran, Motok, Doms/Nadiyals, [[Assamese Muslims]] (particularly Goria, Moria, Deshi communities), Assamese Sikhs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet the Axomiya Sikhs |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2013/20130324/spectrum/main4.htm |newspaper=The Tribune |location=Chandigarh |date=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Assamese Christians speaking Assamese or any other tribal dialect of Assam as their mother tongue and indigenous ethnic groups of other neighbouring North-East states.

==History==
The first usage of the English word "Assamese" is noted in colonial times; based on same principle as [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]], [[Nepali language|Nepalese]] and [[Canarese]], derived from the [[Anglicised]]  word "Assam"&lt;ref&gt;Sarma, Satyendranath (1976), ''Assamese Literature'', Page 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Das, Bhuban Mohan (1987) "The Peoples of Assam" [https://books.google.com/books?id=wcIOc0YaxGEC&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.23] "The modern name Assam is an anglicised form of the Assamese name Asom"&lt;/ref&gt; with the suffix [[wiktionary:-ese|-ese]], meaning "[[wiktionary:Assamese|of Assam]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/--ese ese definition]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Western Assam]] from early to pre–colonial times was known as "[[Ancient Kamrup|'Kamarupa]]" (instead of Asama&lt;ref&gt;Sukalpa Bhattacharjee, C Joshua Thomas,2013,''Society,Representation and Textuality:The Critical Interface'' It deals with the expansion of the Mughal Empire in Bengal, Kamrup and Assam.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Satish Chandra (2005), ''Medieval India:Fro Sultanate to the Mughals Part - II'' They had support of many Hindu Rajas of Jessore, Kamrup (Western Assam), Cachar, Tippera, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jackson,2003,''The Delhi Sultanate: A Political and Military History'',P. 141, "No body sought to emulate Mohammad b.

C., Hakluyt Society's Publications. In this account, Bowrey describes the death of [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]], who had occupied the capital of the [[Ahom kingdom]] in the 17th century thus: "They lost the best of Nabobs, the Kingdome of Acham, and, by consequence, many large privileges."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1682, the [[Kamrup region|eastern Kamrup]] was annexed by Ahom kingdom&lt;ref&gt;"In the ''Battle of Itakhuli'' in September 1682, the Ahom forces chased the defeated Mughals nearly one hundred kilometers back to the Manas river. The Manas then became the Ahom–Mughal boundary until the British occupation." {{harv|Richards|1995|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the expanded kingdom continued to be called as the "Kingdom of Assam" by Europeans&lt;ref&gt;"The Kingdom of Assam, where it is entered from Bengal, commences on the north of the Berhampooter, at the Khonder Chokey, nearly opposite to the picturesque estate of the late Mr Raush at Goalpara; and at the Nagrabaree Hill on the South", Wade, Dr John Peter, (1805) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=WItJAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA116 A Geographical Sketch of Assam]" in Asiatic Annual Register, reprinted {{harv|Sharma|1972|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; till 1821, when the Ahom kingdom became [[Burmese invasions of Assam|part]] of the [[Konbaung Dynasty|Burmese Empire]].&lt;ref name="Last_Days_of_Ahom_Monarchy,P.225"&gt;Baruah, S. L.

After Assam became part of [[British India]], the newly constituted province came to be known by its new anglicised name [[Colonial Assam|Assam]] after its largest constituent, and the name ''Assamese / Asamiya'' came to be associated with the [[Assamese language]] which was erstwhile known as [[Kamrupi language|Kamrupi]].&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar Sen, ''Grammatical sketches_of Indian languages_with comparative_vocabulary and texts'', P31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different views==
According to Yasmin Saikia, "the group that now identifies as [[Ahom people|Tai–Ahom]] were historically seen as the Assamese people. However, the term ethnic Assamese is now associated by the Indian government at [[Delhi]] with the Assamese speaking [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo–Aryan]], [[Tibeto-Burman]] and [[Proto-Australoid|Austric]] groups (''comprising all religious beliefs'') of Assam. The [[Tai–Ahoms|Tai-Ahom]] people were a [[dominant minority]] during the Ahom Rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p9PkFF3uq_8C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;d |title=Fragmented Memories|author=Yasmin Saikia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current issues==

Illegal immigrants from Bangladesh has been a key issue in Assam. Most of the immigrants settle in Assam due to economic reasons and their population is estimated to be between 7-8 million.{{cn|date=August 2017}} The issue of illegal influx has a 30-year-old history, starting with the anti-foreigner agitation that began in 1979 under the leadership of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU). In 1985, after hundreds of people died in course of independent India’s biggest mass uprising, the AASU and other agitation groups signed an agreement with the Centre called the Assam Accord. It fixed 25 March 1971 as the cut-off date for detection and expulsion of illegal migrants, meaning anyone found entering India after this date were to be detected and sent back. In the three decades that followed, a few thousand illegal Bangladeshi migrants have been expelled by successive state governments, which included the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), a party that was formed with the mandate of freeing Assam of illegal aliens. Many of these ‘expelled’ people are believed to have come back.{{Unreliable source|date=August 2017}}

According to an Assam government white paper, between 1985 and 2012, 2,442 illegal immigrants from Bangladesh had been expelled from the state. The central home ministry said in 2004 that it estimated a total of five million illegal immigrants in Assam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://qz.com/652033/ticking-time-bomb-in-assam-a-final-count-of-illegal-immigrants/|title=Ticking time bomb in Assam: a final count of illegal immigrants|work=quartz|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;Shri Indrajit Gupta, the then Home Minister of India stated in the Parliament on 6 May, 1997 that there were 10 million illegal migrants residing in India.

The '''Baligham''', also called the Nepgayidbi ("people of the palace") are an ethnic group in [[Cameroon]].  The Ndaghams left Bafu-Fondong (about 4&amp;nbsp;km from [[Dschang]], [[West Region (Cameroon)|western region]] of Cameroon), in the mid-18th century due to several factors including [[Fula people|Fulani]] raids or Jihads{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}, and [[famine]] caused by [[desertification]].

In their long and eventful migration, the Baligamba kingdom had become too large and after the loss of their leader Gawolbe, quarrels over leadership occurred which led to the breakup of the kingdom into small factions. One by one, faction after faction left, each going their own way until the legitimate successor, Galanga, was left only with a handful of followers.  These he named Nepgayidbi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2124">The '''Bassari people''' are an African people living in [[Senegal]], [[Gambia]], [[Guinea]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]]. The total population is between 10,000 and 30,000. Most of the Bassari are concentrated on either side of the Senegal-Guinea border southwest of [[Kedougou]], [[Kédougou Region]]. This areas is referred to in French as ''Pays Bassari'', or ''liyan'' in the [[Bassari language]].

The Bassari speak a [[Tenda language]], ''o-niyan''. They refer to themselves as ''a-liyan'', pl. ''bi-liyan''. Most of the group are animists, with a significant minority of Christians (both Catholic and Protestant). Very few Bassari are Muslims.  They have close relations with the [[Fula people]] centered locally in the nearby hills of the [[Fouta Djallon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bsc Bassari]. in Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Accessed 2009-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bassari are subsistence farmers for the most part, growing rice, millet, earth-peas and fonio. They also migrate to the cities and towns of Senegal and Guinea in the dry season in search of wage-labor, using the money they earn to buy household equipment, clothing and other necessary items.

The mythology of the [[Bassari]] is centered on the creation god [[Unumbotte]].&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Lurker. ''The Routledge Dictionary of Gods and Goddesses, Devils and Demons''. Routledge, Nov 11, 2004 pg. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Slave rebellion|slave revolt]] took place in the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colony]] of [[Curaçao]] in 1795, led by [[Tula (Curaçao)|Tula]], a local slave, and resulted in a month-long conflict on the island between escapees and the colonial government.

==Revolt==
[[File:Portret Tula Curacao.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Modern artist impression of rebel leader [[Tula (Curaçao)|Tula]]]]

Bandabou had between 4,000 and 5,000 inhabitants in 1795, mostly enslaved.  

The slave [[Tula (Curaçao)|Tula]] had been preparing the insurrection for some weeks.  On the morning of August 17, 1795, at the Knip plantation of slave master Caspar Lodewijk van Uytrecht at Bandabou, Curaçao, Tula led an uprising of 40 to 50 people. The enslaved met on the square of the plantation and informed van Uytrecht they would no longer be his slaves. He told them to present their complaints to the lieutenant governor at [[Fort Amsterdam (Curaçao)|Fort Amsterdam]]. They left and went from Knip to Lagun, where they freed 22 slaves from jail.

From Lagun, the liberators went to the sugar plantation of Saint Kruis, where they were joined by more rebels under Bastian Karpata. Tula then led the liberated people from farm to farm, freeing more people.

The slave owners had now retreated to the city, leaving their plantations unprotected. At the same time, a confederate French slave, Louis Mercier, led another group of freed slaves to Saint Kruis, where he took the commandant, van der Grijp, and ten of his mixed race soldiers as prisoners. Mercier also attacked Knip, where he freed more slaves and took some weapons. He then rejoined Tula, locating him by following the trail of destruction Tula had left behind.

==Response==
[[File:Victoria na Porto Mari 1795.jpg|thumb|Modern artist impression of the victory of the slaves at Portomari]]

Van Uytrecht in the meantime had sent his son on horseback with a note to the governor, and at 7 p.m., the council met to prepare a defense of the colony.  Governor Johannes de Veer ordered Commander Wierts of the navy ship ''Medea'', which was in port at the time, to defend [[Fort Amsterdam (Curaçao)|Fort Amsterdam]]. Sixty-seven men, both white and black, under the command of Lieutenant R.G. Plegher were sent against the rebels.  They went by boat to Boca San Michiel from [[Willemstad]], and from there on foot to Portomari, where Tula and his followers were camping. When the Dutch military arrived there on August 19, they attacked Tula's group, but were defeated.

At the plantation of Fontein, Pedro Wakao killed the Dutch slaver, Sabel, who became the first white victim of the rebellion. Wakao also found more weapons at Fontein.

The governor was notified of Plegher's defeat, and the rebellion was now considered a serious threat to the white community. The governor and the slavers had raised a force of 60 well-armed horsemen under the command of Captain Baron van Westerholt to renew the attack. Westerholt had orders to offer leniency to the rebels if they would surrender. Among this party was [[Jacobus Schink]], a Franciscan priest who served as negotiator and attempted to prevent bloodshed.

Tula was aware of the revolution that had resulted in freedom for the enslaved in Haiti. Tula argued that, since the Netherlands were now captured by the French, they should get their freedom as well. The three demands of Tula were: an end to [[collective punishment]], an end to labor on Sunday, and the freedom to buy clothes and goods from others than their own masters. There were two attempts at negotiating with the enslaved. The first one was carried out by Father Schink. When Father Schink spoke with Tula, he refused to accept anything less than freedom. Schink reported back to Baron Westerholt, and the latter decided to get more reinforcements and attack. He attempted a last negotiation, but when he was turned down by the rebels, he ordered that any slave with a weapon be shot. In the ensuing fight, the rebels were defeated. Ten to twenty of them were killed, and the rest escaped.

==Consequences==
[[File:Ehekushon di Tula website.JPG|thumb|Modern artist impression of the execution of Tula]]

The rebels began a [[guerrilla]] campaign, poisoning wells and stealing food. On September 19, Tula and Karpata were betrayed by a slave. They were taken prisoner, and the war was effectively over. (Louis Mercier had already been caught at Knip.) After Tula was captured, he was publicly tortured to death on [[October 3]], 1795, almost seven weeks after the revolt began. Karpata, Louis Mercier and Pedro Wakao were also executed. In addition, many slaves had been massacred in the earlier repression. After the revolt had been crushed the white Curaçao government formulated rules that provided some rights to slaves on the island.

==Legacy==
[[File:Monument to 1795 Slave Revolt, Landhuis Kenepa, Curaçao.jpg|thumb|Statue commemorating the start of the revolt against slavery]]

At the height of the insurrection, there were probably 1,000 rebels.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} August 17 is celebrated in Curaçao to commemorate the beginning of the liberation struggle. When the race based system of slavery was finally abolished on the island in 1863, there were approximately 5500 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gert Oostindie|authorlink1=Slave Resistance, colour lines, and the impact of the French and Haitian revolutions in Curacao|editor1-last=Klooster|editor1-first=Wim|editor2-last=Oostindie|editor2-first=Gert|title=Curacao in the Age of Revolutions, 1795 - 1800|date=2011|publisher=KITLV Press|location=The Netherlands|isbn=978 90 6718 380 2|language=English|chapter=Slave Resistance, colour lines, and the impact of the French and Haitian revolutions in Curacao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a monument to Tula and the rebels on the south coast of Curaçao, near the Holiday Beach Hotel. This is the site where Tula was executed. The [[Tula Museum]] was named after the rebel leader.

The revolt was dramatized in the 2013 Dutch film ''[[Tula: The Revolt]]'', directed by [[Jeroen Leinders]] and starring Obi Abili as Tula alongside [[Jeroen Krabbé]] and [[Danny Glover]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulathemovie.com Tula The Revolt]. Retrieved on 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006 '''e-Types''' has been subject to academic research by scholars from [[Copenhagen Business School]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.dk/uddannelser/kandidat/valgfag/foraar_2010/valgfag_kandidat_foraar_2010/innovation_og_entreprenoerskab_innovation_and_entrepreneruship/cm_e98_managing_in_the_creative_economy CM E98 - Managing in the Creative Economy* | CBS - Copenhagen Business School&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harvard Business School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/search/Robert+D.+Austin?Nao=50 Case Studies, Articles &amp; Books - Harvard Business Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
e-Types was founded in Vesterbro, Copenhagen, in 1997 by a team of young graphic designers. Over the past decade e-Types has developed from a business of 5 employees into a consultancy of 50 strategists, designers and account managers. In 2010 e-Types became part of [[e-Types Group]].

The company's branding work includes [[Danish Film Institute]] (1999), [[Aquascutum]] (2002), [[Rzeczpospolita]] (2004), [[Royal Danish Theatre]] (2005), [[3XN]] (2007), [[CPH:PIX]] (2008), [[Dansk Industri|DI]] (2008), [[Tryg]] (2010), [[Berlingske]] (2011), [[Sanoma]] (2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://e-types.com/35305/ e-Types&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academia ==
By 2006, e-Types became an object of interest to scholars in the [[creative businesses]] academia. The cooperation with [[Learning Lab Denmark]] turned into an industrial [[PhD]] from The Danish School of Education (now [[University of Aarhus]]) using e-Types as the primary case of the research.&lt;ref&gt;http://nordcode.tkk.fi/lyngbypapers/nc3_friis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The focus was "Conscious Design Practice as a Strategic Tool".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-types.com/42114/%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0e-Types%20PhD. e-Types PhD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Professor Robert Austin from [[Harvard Business School]] made a different case-study concerning [[Innovation]] [[Strategy]] of a Design Firm.  The case-study was discussed and criticised at the 2006 Seattle Innovation Symposium at the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwtv.org/programs/displayevent.aspx?rID=8280&amp;fID=1472 BrainWorks - UWTV.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fingallian''' or the '''Fingal dialect''' is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[English languages|variety of English]] formerly spoken in [[Fingal]], Ireland. It is thought to have been an offshoot of [[Middle English]], which was brought to Ireland during the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]], and was extinct by the mid-19th century. Although little is known of Fingallian, it is thought to have been similar to the [[Forth and Bargy dialect]] of [[County Wexford]].&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, Adam James: ''Spoken English in Ireland 1600 – 1740'', pp194ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving literature of Fingallian consists of two satirical or humorous poems, the short "Fingallian Dance" and the much longer ''Purgatorium Hibernicum''. Both poems are anonymous and are thought to be humorous parodies of Fingallian by non-native speakers, so their value from a linguistic point of view may be limited.

==History==
[[File:Ireland map County Dublin Fingal.png|thumb|[[Ireland]] (left) and [[County Dublin]] (right), with [[Fingal]] in light green]]

Fingallian was spoken in the region of [[Fingal]], traditionally the part of [[County Dublin]] north of the [[River Tolka]], and now a separate county. It was spoken in the area near the northern border. The name "Fingal" is from the Irish ''Fine Gall'', or "territory of foreigners", probably a reference to a [[Norse–Gaels|Norse settlement]] in the area. Linguist [[Alf Sommerfelt]] proposed the idea of a Norse influence on the Fingallian dialect, though later scholars have found no evidence of such a connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hickey |first= Raymond |title= Dublin English: Evolution and Change |url= |accessdate= |year= 2005 |publisher= John Benjamins Publishing |location= |isbn= 90-272-4895-8 |pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[Forth and Bargy dialect]] of [[County Wexford]], Fingallian is thought to have derived from [[Middle English]], which was introduced by "[[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]]" settlers after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169. Middle English was well established in southeastern Ireland until the 14th century, when the area was re-[[Gaelicized]] and English was displaced. As such, the Yola and Fingal dialects would have been the only attested [[relict]]s of this original English variety in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hickey |first= Raymond|title= Dublin English: Evolution and Change |url= |accessdate= |year= 2005 |publisher= John Benjamins Publishing |location= |isbn= 90-272-4895-8 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Fingallian Dance''==
The poem most likely to have been composed by a native speaker of Fingallian is ''The Fingallian Dance,'' a brief, three-stanza poem written between about 1650 and 1660.&lt;ref name=Hickey198&gt;{{cite book |last= Hickey |first= Raymond|title= Dublin English: Evolution and Change |url= |accessdate= |year= 2005 |publisher= John Benjamins Publishing |location= |isbn= 90-272-4895-8 |pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a mildly indecent poem about a man going to see dancers at a [[bullring]] ([[bull fighting]] was practised in 17th century Ireland). Although the poem is likely to have been standardised when written down, it gives a flavour of Fingallian, particularly forms like ''fat'' for "what" or ''fen'' for "when". Other words that need explanation are ''ame'' 'them' and ''plack-keet'', 'part of a petticoat'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=p-9_YKUZLrkC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;dq=the+fingallian+dance&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XPlzwHUx2z&amp;sig=bqfEkYVf7s0wlnLPTJun3hZZcwk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yA5tUZf5NcKJhQftq4CgAQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20fingallian%20dance&amp;f=false Carpenter, Andrew ,''Verse in English from Tudor and Stuart Ireland'', p 310]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

:''The Fingallian Dance'' c.1650
:-
:On a day in the Spring,
:As I went to bolring
:to view the jolly Daunciers,
:They did trip it so high
:(Be me shole!) I did spee
:six Cunts abateing Seav'n hairs
:-
:But wondering on 'ame,
:Fat make 'em so tame,
:Fen de catch at their plack-keet,
:The maids of y-yore
:Wou'd y-cree, and y-rore,
:And make o foul rackeet.
:-
:But fire take 'ame,
:They made me ashame,
:and when I went home to me weef
:And told her the chaunce
:Of the Maids in the Daunce,
:'Peace thy prateing', say'd shee, 'for dee Leef!'

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Purgatorium Hibernicum''==
The ''Purgatoriam Hibernicum'' is a humorous and bawdy burlesque or travesty on the Roman poet [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. It exists in three versions: the original manuscript (''Purgatoriam Hibernicum''), another manuscript entitled ''The Fingallian Travesty: the Sixt Book of Virgill's Aenoeids a la mode de Fingaule'' (1670–5), and a printed version called ''The Irish Hudibras'' or ''The Fingallian Burlesque'' (1689).&lt;ref name=Hickey198/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=p-9_YKUZLrkC&amp;pg=PA411&amp;lpg=PA411&amp;dq=purgatorium+hibernicum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XPlzEN-w9z&amp;sig=hiRpvJysSlum1ob-ck_VllT4OJs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y0l6UY_HFoywhAeG34HQAw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=purgatorium%20hibernicum&amp;f=false Carpenter, Andrew, ''Verse in English from Tudor and Stuart Ireland'', pp 411 – 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Virgil's prince Aeneas and his noble lover Dido are transformed into a bumbling young Fingallian called 'Prince' Nees and a coarse ex-nun Dydy. The names of all the characters are converted into mock 'Irish' forms and the places mentioned in Virgil's text become places in Fingal. Part of the humour for the Anglo-Irish readers of the poem is that Nees and Dydy converse with each other in broad Fingallian. Although the intention is supposedly to mock their speech, it is rendered with such vitality and wit that the effect is actually to give the reader an appreciation of its richness. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The short extract below provides a good example of Fingallian. In it Nees encounters Dydy again and seeing her look pale and unwell realises that he may have been responsible for giving her the 'flame' or venereal disease. A few features need explanation: 'V' is used instead of 'W' in Fingallian; 'suggam' is a kind of straw rope'; Ful dea ro is derived from Irish ''fuil Dé, a rogha'' 'God's blood, my sweetheart':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'Sure, Sure!' sayes Nees, 'dis me old vench is!'
:But when he drew more neare her quarters,
:And know her by her suggam garters,
:'Ful dea, ro, dou unlucky jade,
:I'll chance upon dee! Art thou dead?
:Fat devill vas be in dee, vench?
:Vas he soe hot is cou'd no quench
:De  flame?' Indeed, oh no! but Nees chief 
:Occasion is of all dis mischeif'.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nees continues with an attempt to sweet talk Dydys and asks her for a 'pogue', but his fears are justified and Dydy is having none of it. She tells him that if he think he can have another 'bout' with her, he can think again – after he has ''play'd the vagge'' (been a wag) with her and given her the ''bagge'' (rejected her) she will ''vatch de vales'' ('watch the walls', be on guard) and foil his plan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'I, Nees', sayes she in mighty snuffe,
:'and be! is tink is varm enough,
:If dou cam shance but to find out
:Dee old consort to have a bout –
:and den, fen dou has play'd de vagge,
:to give me, as before, de bagge!
:Butt I will vatch de vales, Nees,
:And putt foile on dee by dis chees,'

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then Dydy goes on her way in high dudgeon.

==''Letters from Ireland''== 
In [[John Dunton]]'s ''Letters from Ireland'' (1698) he writes that in Fingal "they have a sort of jargon speech peculiar to themselves, and understand not one word of [[Irish language|Irish]], and are as little understood by the English". Dunton gives a sample of the language; a [[Keening|lamentation]] that a mother made over the grave of her son, who was a keen fisher and hunter. Note that ''a roon'' and ''moorneeng'' are from the Irish ''a rúin'' "(secret) love" (vocative) and ''múirnín'' "love" (lit. "little trust"):

This is roughly translated as:

==Modern Fingal English==
[[File:Cottage at Knocknagin, Co. Dublin - geograph.org.uk - 701431.jpg|thumb|Traditional cottage, Knocknagin, Fingal. The cottage would have been originally thatched]]

{{lang|de|'''Gastarbeiter'''}} ({{IPA-de|ˈɡastˌʔaɐ̯baɪtɐ|pron|De-Gastarbeiter.ogg}}; both singular and plural) is {{langnf||German|(literally) "guest worker"}}. It refers to [[foreign worker|foreign]] or [[migrant worker]]s, particularly those who had moved to [[West Germany]] mainly in the 1950s, 60s and early 70s, seeking work as part of a formal guest worker program (''Gastarbeiterprogramm''). Other countries had similar programs: in the Netherlands and Belgium it was called the {{lang|nl|gastarbeider}} program; in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland it was called {{lang|sv|arbetskraftsinvandring}} (workforce-immigration); and in [[East Germany]] such workers were called ''Vertragsarbeiter''. The term was used during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] era as was ''[[Forced labour in Germany during World War II|Fremdarbeiter]]'' (German for "foreign worker"). However, the latter term had negative connotations, so was no longer used after World War II.

==Historical background==
Following [[World War II]] there were severe labour shortage in continental [[northern Europe]] and high unemployment in [[southern Europe]]an countries{{cn|date=March 2016}} and in Turkey.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The guest worker programmes were largely created because of the labour imbalance and as a result of political pressure from the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unzensuriert.at/content/002553-T-rkische-Gastarbeiter-kamen-auf-Druck-der-USA|title=Türkische Gastarbeiter kamen auf Druck der USA|date=2010-11-07|work=Unzensuriert.at|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PClaIcocV0kC&amp;pg=PA215|title=The Economics of Europe and the European Union|last=Neal|first=Larry|date=2007-03-01|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781139462778|location=|pages=215|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s and 1960s, West Germany signed bilateral recruitment agreements with a number of countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_lOlN3TwNQC&amp;pg=PA79|title=Turkish Culture in German Society Today|first1=David|last1=Horrocks|first2=Eva|last2=Kolinsky|date=11 September 1996|publisher=Berghahn Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy]] (22 November 1955), [[Spain]] (29 March 1960), [[Greece]] (30 March 1960), [[Turkey]] (30 October 1961), [[Morocco]] (21 June 1963), [[Portugal]] (17 March 1964), [[Tunisia]] (18 October 1965), and [[Yugoslavia]] (12 October 1968).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?id=235 Germany: Immigration in Transition] by Veysel Oezcan. Social Science Centre Berlin. July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaja Shonick, "Politics, Culture, and Economics: Reassessing the West German Guest Worker Agreement with Yugoslavia," ''Journal of Contemporary History,'' Oct 2009, Vol. 44 Issue 4, pp 719-736&lt;/ref&gt; These agreements allowed the recruitment of guest workers to work in the industrial sector in jobs that required few qualifications.

There were several justifications for these arrangements. Firstly, during the 1950s, Germany experienced a so-called [[Wirtschaftswunder]] or "economic miracle" and needed laborers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencev1.orf.at/science/news/133579|title=Materieller und geistiger Wiederaufbau Österreichs - ORF ON Science|website=sciencev1.orf.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; The labour shortage was made more acute after the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] in August 1961, which drastically reduced the large-scale flow of East German workers. Secondly, West Germany justified these programs as a form of developmental aid. It was expected that guest workers would learn useful skills which could help them build their own countries after returning home.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gerling, Vera: Soziale Dienste für zugewanderte Senioren/innen: Erfahrungen aus Deutschland, {{ISBN|978-3-8311-2803-7}}, S.78&lt;/ref&gt;

The first guest workers were recruited from European nations. However, Turkey pressured West Germany to admit its citizens as guest workers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Theodor Blank]], Secretary of State for Employment, opposed such agreements. He held the opinion that the cultural gap between Germany and Turkey would be too large and also held the opinion that Germany didn't need any more laborers because there were enough unemployed people living in the poorer regions of Germany who could fill these vacancies. The [[United States]], however, put some political pressure on Germany, wanting to stabilize and create goodwill from a potential ally. West Germany and Turkey reached an agreement in 1961.&lt;ref name="Heike Knortz 1973"&gt;Heike Knortz: Diplomatische Tauschgeschäfte. "Gastarbeiter" in der westdeutschen Diplomatie und Beschäftigungspolitik 1953-1973. Böhlau Verlag, Köln 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1961 Turkish citizens (largely from rural areas) soon became the largest group of guest workers in West Germany. The expectation at the time on the part of both the West German and Turkish governments was that working in Germany would be only "temporary." The migrants, mostly male, were allowed to work in Germany for a period of one or two years before returning to their home country in order to make room for other migrants. Some{{Quantify|date=January 2017}} migrants did return, after having built up savings for their return.

Until very recently, Germany was not perceived as a country of immigration ("kein Einwanderungsland") by both the majority of its political leaders and the majority of its population. When the country's political leaders realized that many of the persons from certain countries living in Germany were jobless, some calculations were done and according to those calculations, paying unemployed foreigners for leaving the country was cheaper in the long run than paying unemployment benefits. A "Gesetz zur Förderung der Rückkehrbereitsschaft" ("law to advance the willingness to return home") was passed. The government started paying jobless people from a number of countries, such as Turks, Moroccans and Tunisians, a so-called ''Rückkehrprämie'' ("repatriation grant") or ''Rückkehrhilfe'' ("repatriation help") if they returned home. A person returning home received 10,500 [[Deutsche Mark]] and an additional 1,500 Deutsche Mark for his spouse and also 1,500 Deutsche Mark for each of his children if they returned to the country of his origin.&lt;ref&gt;S. Dünkel (2008) "Interkulturalität und Differenzwahrnehmung in der Migrationsliteratur", p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IAB: "Gesetz zur Förderung der Rückkehrbereitschaft von Ausländern"&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement with Turkey ended in 1973 but few workers returned because there were few good jobs in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Castles, "The Guests Who Stayed - The Debate on 'Foreigners Policy' in the German Federal Republic," ''International Migration Review'' Vol. 19, No. 3, pp. 517-534 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2545854 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead they brought in wives and family members and settled in ethnic enclaves.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried E. Volker, "Turkish Labour Migration to Germany: Impact on both Economies," ''Middle Eastern Studies,'' Jan 1976, Vol. 12 Issue 1, pp 45-72&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 it was revealed that ex-chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] had plans to halve the Turkish population of Germany in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=''[[Spiegel Online]]''|title= Kohl Defends Plan to Halve Turkish Population|date= 2 August 2013|url= http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/helmut-kohl-admits-to-old-plan-to-halve-turkish-population-a-914572.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010 there were about 4 million people of Turkish descent in Germany. The generation born in Germany attended German schools, but some had a poor command of either German or Turkish, and thus had either low-skilled jobs or were unemployed. Most are [[Muslim]]s and are presently reluctant to become German citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Pratt  Ewing, "Living Islam in the Diaspora: Between Turkey and Germany," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' Volume 102, Number 2/3, Spring/Summer 2003, pp. 405-431 in [[Project MUSE]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Mandel, ''Cosmopolitan Anxieties: Turkish Challenges to Citizenship and Belonging in Germany'' (Duke University Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany used the [[jus sanguinis]] principle in its nationality or citizenship law which determined the right to citizenship based on a person's German ancestry, and not by place of birth. According children born in Germany of a guest worker were not automatically entitled to citizenship; but were granted the "Aufenthaltsberechtigung" ("right to reside") and might choose to apply for German citizenship later in their lives, which was granted to persons who had lived in Germany for at least 15 years and fulfilled a number of other preconditions (they must work for their living, they should not have a criminal record and other preconditions). Today, children of foreigners born on German soil are granted German citizenship automatically if the parent has been in Germany for at least eight years as a legal immigrant. As a rule those children may also have the citizenship of the parents' home country. Those between 18 and 23 years of age must choose to keep either German citizenship or their ancestral citizenship.
The governments of the German States have begun campaigns to persuade immigrants to acquire German citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=zuletzt aktualisiert: 14.09.2009 - 15:02 |url=http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/Mehr-Auslaender-sollen-Deutsche-werden_aid_757689.html |title=NRW-Regierung startet Einbürgerungskampagne: Mehr Ausländer sollen Deutsche werden &amp;#124; RP ONLINE |publisher=Rp-online.de |date=14 September 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Those who hold German citizenship have a number of advantages. For example, only those holding German citizenship may vote in certain elections. Also there are some jobs that may only be performed by German citizens. As a rule these are jobs which require a high identification with the government. Only those holding German citizenship are be allowed to become a schoolteacher, a police officer, or a soldier. Most jobs however do not require  German citizenship. Those who do not hold German citizenship, but instead just a "right to reside", however, still receive many of the benefits. They may attend schools, receive [[medical insurance]], be paid children's benefits, receive [[welfare]] and housing assistance.

In many cases guest workers integrated neatly into German society - [[Dietrich Tränhardt]] researched this topic in relation to Spanish guest workers. While many Spanish that came to Germany were illiterate peasants, their offspring were academically successful (see: [[Academic achievement among different groups in Germany]]) and do well in the job market. Spanish ''Gastarbeiter'' werealso very likely to marry Germans, which could be considered an indicator of assimilation. According to a study in 2000, 81.2% of all Spanish or partly Spanish children in Germany were from a Spanish-German family.&lt;ref&gt;Thränhardt, Dietrich (4 December 2006). "[http://egora.uni-muenster.de/pol/personen/thraenhardt/bindata/05.12.2006_Spanische_Einwanderer_schaffen_Bildungskapital.pdf Spanische Einwanderer schaffen Bildungskapital: Selbsthilfe-Netzwerke und Integrationserfolg in Europa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630130038/http://egora.uni-muenster.de/pol/personen/thraenhardt/bindata/05.12.2006_Spanische_Einwanderer_schaffen_Bildungskapital.pdf |date=30 June 2007 }}" (in German). Universität Münster.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some, and still are, tensions in German society, because Muslim immigrants feel they have been religiously discriminated against. For example, while the [[Christian]] churches are allowed to collect [[church tax]] in Germany, [[Muslim]] mosques are not able to do so as they are not as yet organised in a corporative association (which is sometimes criticised as forcing Christian organisation-style on non-Christians). While German universities have educated [[Jew]]ish, [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] clerics and religious teachers, in the past none of the German universities have offered education for Muslim teachers and clerics. However, today such university courses exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Die Zeit, Hamburg, Germany |url=http://www.zeit.de/studium/hochschule/2009-12/islam-uni |title=Religionsunterricht: Der Islam kommt an die Universitäten &amp;#124; Studium &amp;#124; ZEIT ONLINE |language=de |publisher=Zeit.de |date=23 December 2009 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims were often also not pleased that the Christian cross is a common item to be found in German classrooms, something that used to be relatively common. The fact that most schools offer Catholic and Protestant religious education and ethics but no Islamic religious education has also been criticised (especially because religious education is compulsory, replaceable by ethics). Students are allowed to wear a normal headscarf in school, however in 2010 a Muslim student sued a [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] headmaster, because she was not allowed to wear a [[Khimar]] in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Die Zeit, Hamburg, Germany |url=http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/schule/2010-02/schule-schleier-islam |title=Schülerinnen im Schleier: Umstrittener Dress-Code in der Schule &amp;#124; Gesellschaft &amp;#124; ZEIT ONLINE |language=de |publisher=Zeit.de |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==East Germany==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-01986-09083, Schwarza, kubanische Gastarbeiterin.jpg|thumb|A guest worker from [[Cuba]], working in an East German factory (Chemiefaserkombinat "Wilhelm Pieck"), 1986]]
After the division of Germany into East and West in 1949, East Germany faced an acute labour shortage, mainly because of East Germans fleeing into the western zones occupied by the Allies; in 1963 the GDR (German Democratic Republic) signed its first guest-worker contract with Poland.  In contrast to the guest-workers in West Germany, the guest-workers that arrived in East Germany came mainly from socialist and communist countries allied with the Soviets and the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] used its guest-worker program to build international solidarity among fellow communist governments.

The guest workers in East Germany came mainly from the Eastern Bloc, [[Vietnam]], [[North Korea]], [[People's Republic of Angola|Angola]], [[People's Republic of Mozambique|Mozambique]], and [[Cuba]]. Residency was typically limited to only 3 years. The conditions East German Gastarbeiter had to live in were much harsher than the living-conditions of the Gastarbeiter in Western Germany, these mainly being single-sex dormitories.&lt;ref name="einwanderungsstadt113"&gt;Stepahn Lanz: "Berlin aufgemischt - abendländisch - multikulturell - kosmopolitisch? Die politische Konstruktion einer Einwanderungsstadt". 2007. Bielefeld: transcript Verlag; p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, contact between guest-workers and East German citizens was extremely limited; ''Gastarbeiter'' were usually restricted to their dormitory or an area of the city which Germans were not allowed to enter - furthermore sexual relations with a German led to deportation.&lt;ref name="einwanderungsstadt113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=taz, die tageszeitung |url=http://www.taz.de/1/leben/alltag/artikel/1/unauffaellig-an-die-spitze/ |title=Vietnamesen in Deutschland: Unauffällig an die Spitze |publisher=taz.de |date=25 January 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/panorama/:Vietnamesen-Deutschland-Phuongs-Traum-/637993.html|title=Vietnamesen in Deutschland: Phuongs Traum|periodical=[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]|date=1 October 2008|accessdate=2008-10-18|last=Pfohl|first=Manuela}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female Vertragsarbeiter were not allowed to become pregnant during their stay.

Following the fall of the Berlin Wall and [[German reunification]] in 1990, the population of guest-workers still remaining in the former East Germany faced deportation, premature discontinuation of residence and work permits as well as open discrimination in the workplace. Out of the 100,000 guest-workers remaining in East Germany after reunification, about 75% left because of the rising tide of xenophobia in former East German territories.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Vietnamese were not considered legal immigrants and lived in "grey area". Many started selling goods at the roadside. Ten years after the fall of the Berlin wall most Vietnamese were granted the right to reside however and many started opening little shops.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

After the reunification Germany offered the guest workers USD$2,000 and a ticket home if they left. The country of Vietnam did not accept the ones back who refused to take the money, Germany considered them "illegal immigrants" after 1994. In 1995 Germany paid 140 million $ to the Vietnamese government and made a contract about repatriation which stated that repatriation could be forced if necessary. By 2004 11,000 former Vietnamese guest workers had been repatriated, of which 8,000 against their will.&lt;ref&gt;Minority rights group international. World directory of Minorities and Indigenous people --&gt; Europe --&gt; Germany --&gt; Vietnamese&lt;/ref&gt;

The children of the Vietnamese Gastarbeiter caused what has been called the "Vietnamese miracle".&lt;ref name="Die Zeit, Hamburg, Germany"&gt;{{cite web|author=Die Zeit, Hamburg, Germany |url=http://www.zeit.de/2009/05/B-Vietnamesen |title=Integration: Das vietnamesische Wunder &amp;#124; Gesellschaft &amp;#124; ZEIT ONLINE |language=de |publisher=Zeit.de |date= |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown by a study while in the Berlin districts of Lichtenberg and Marzahn, where those of Vietnamese descent account for only 2 percent of the general population, but make up 17 percent of the university preparatory school population of those districts.&lt;ref&gt;Von Berg, Stefan; Darnstädt, Thomas; Elger, Katrin; Hammerstein, Konstantin von; Hornig, Frank; Wensierski, Peter: "[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-67282817.html Politik der Vermeidung]". Spiegel.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the headmaster of the Barnim Gymnasium, for a university preparatory school (Gymnasium) that has a focus on the natural sciences, 30 percent of the school's freshmen come from Vietnamese families.&lt;ref name="Die Zeit, Hamburg, Germany"/&gt;

==Currently==
Today, the term ''Gastarbeiter'' is no longer accurate, as the former guest worker communities, insofar as they have not returned to their countries of origins, have become permanent residents or citizens, and therefore are in no meaningful sense "guests". However, despite the fact that many of the former "guest workers" have now become German citizens, the term Ausländer or "foreigner" is still colloquially applied to them as well as to their naturalised children and grandchildren. A new word has been used by politicians for several years:  ''Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund'' (German term for: people with an [[immigration]] background). The term was thought to be politically correct because it includes both immigrants and those who, being naturalized, cannot be referred to as immigrants—who are colloquially (and not by necessity xenophobically) called "naturalized immigrants" or "immigrants with a German passport". It also applies to German-born descendants of people who immigrated after 1949. To emphasize their Germanness, they are also with quite a frequency called ''fellowcitizens'', which may result in calling "our Turkish fellow citizens" also those who are foreigners still, or even such Turks in Turkey who never had any contact to Germany.

Gastarbeiter, as a historical term however, referring to the guest worker programme and situation of the 1960s, is neutral and remains the most correct designation.  In literary theory, some German migrant writers (e.g. [[Rafik Schami]]) use the terminology of "guest" and "host" provocatively.

The term "Gastarbeiter" lives on in Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Slovene languages, generally meaning "expatriate" (mostly referring to a second generation from the former Yugoslavia or Bulgaria born or living abroad). The South Slavic spelling reflects the local pronunciation of ''gastarbajter'' (in [[Cyrillic]]: гастарбаjтер or гастарбайтер). In [[Belgrade]]'s jargon, it is commonly shortened to ''gastos'' (гастос), and in [[Zagreb]]'s to ''gastić''.

In modern [[Russia]], the transliterated term gastarbeiter (гастарбайтер) is used to denote workers from former Soviet republics coming to Russia (mainly [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]) in search of work. These workers come primarily from [[Ukraine]], [[Moldova]], [[Armenia]], and [[Tajikistan]]. Also for a guest worker from outside Europe, from China, [[Afghanistan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Ethiopia]]. In contrast to such words as "gastrolle" (гастроль, сoncert tour), "gast professor" (invited to read the course at another university), which came to Russian from German, the word "gastarbeiter" is not neutral in modern Russian and has a negative connotation.

'''Gibraltar Photographic Society''' was established in January 1965 in Gibraltar. The object of the Society is to raise the standards of photography by organising meetings, lectures, excursions, competitions; encouraging beginners and advanced alike by&amp;nbsp;the exchange of ideas and to affiliate with foreign clubs and societies. All classes of&amp;nbsp;photography shall be included.

== Photography in Gibraltar before the formation of the GPS ==
In 1940 a camera club was formed by a group of Gibraltarians who held their meetings at the now defunct Calpe Institute. This club was never firmly established and more often than not it was closed due to lack of support from both local photographers and those from the Services. The problem was very likely due to the fact that no photographer in Gibraltar had the experience of organising and running successfully a club of this nature.

In 1960, after having run for some months with a very small membership, the club closed, never to re-open. Its assets, about £30, were placed in a suspended account and held by the Committee of the Calpe Institute. Any hopes of re-forming the club were dashed by the closing of the Calpe Institute itself.

During most of this time, the United Services Camera Club based at the Command Education Centre, ran successfully under various names, though with a small membership. The Club was not open to local civilians. This Club was closed in July 1964 by the Command Education Officer as a result of poor administration in the Club’s affairs, and re-opened in October 1964.

=== Formation of the Gibraltar Photographic Society ===
In October 1964, a Sergeant K Lloyd of the Middlesex Regiment and member of the United Services Camera Club, and local photographer Mr Albert Pizzarello put on an exhibition at the John Mackintosh Hall with a view of generating interest in the formation of a Service/civilian club. The venture proved successful and that same month a meeting was held at the John Mackintosh Hall with the aim of forming a camera club which would be open to everyone in Gibraltar, including servicemen and UK based civilians. The club was to be called The John Mackintosh Hall Camera Club, and would incorporate the United Services Camera Club. A caretaker Committee was formed and a provisional programme arranged.

In January 1965, the first Annual General Meeting took place and the following officers appointed :

Chairman :&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Wing Commander P A Rumbold Scott, RAF

Secretary &amp; A/Chairman&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A A Hammon, Esq

Treasurer &amp; A/Secretary&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Staff Sergeant C P Berry, RAOC

Syllabus Secretary&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A J Pizzarello, Esq

House Member&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A Perera, Esq

Committee Members &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - T Adamberry, Esq

- M M Bonilla, Esq

- Sgt K Lloyd was co-opted to the Committee.

The Chairman due to his appointment as Senior Air Staff Officer, RAF North Front, was frequently away from Gibraltar and so his duties were in the main carried out by Mr Hammon. As a result, S/Sgt Berry usually carried out the task of Secretary as well as that of Treasurer. Lectures, initial organisation and instruction were generally carried out by Messrs Berry and Pizzarello.

Later that year the Committee decided to change the name of the Club to that of The Gibraltar Photographic Society. An application for affiliation to The Photographic Alliance of Great Britain was accepted. The aims of the Society were as follows :

(a) To stimulate and promote amateur photographic activity within Gibraltar

(b) To provide a congenial club atmosphere where enthusiasts can meet others similarly inclined.

(c) To instruct, guide and assist novices in basic theoretical and practical&amp;nbsp;photographic work

(d) To cater for the intermediate and advanced amateur photographer by means of lectures, demonstrations,                               visual aids, instruction and discussion

(e) To work in close liaison with the Photographic Alliance of Great Britain, to &amp;nbsp; promote the advancement of, and                         maintain a high standard of amateur&amp;nbsp;photography in Gibraltar.

Subscriptions were set at 5 shillings (25p) a month for full members and 2 shillings and 6 pence (12½p) for those under the age of 18. Meetings were held on Wednesdays at fortnightly intervals, with a short recess during the Summer. Several local professional photographers were elected to Honorary Membership, and Lady Lathbury, the Governor’s wife, accepted to become patroness of the Society.

==== To the present ====
By February 1966, the membership of the Society stood at around 40, with the average attendance at meetings between 20 and 25. Initially, novices were placed into groups with an intermediate or advanced worker nominated as group leader whose duty was to instruct the novices. Printing was carried out in the group leader’s own darkroom or at the John Mackintosh Hall. This system worked but with great difficulty, and was eventually abandoned. Competitions for black and white prints were held about once a month, and based on set themes. Entries were limited to 4 prints per person, and the print size restricted to 9 x 7 inches. It was not till 1974 that the first slides competition was held. This was just a one-off event. It was not till 1977 that regular slides competitions were incorporated into the annual programme, whilst the first colour prints competitions were not introduced till 1979. Initially, beginners had to compete in the same group as everybody else, but in 1973 they were provided with their own set of competitions.

Since its founding, the Society has held an annual exhibition. At first this consisted of black and white prints, but in 1977 two other sections were added : a colour prints section and one for beginners. The addition of a slides section had to wait till 1986. The size and popularity of the exhibition grew to such an extent that since 1982 two exhibition rooms have been required for it. Problems with the judging of the annual exhibition resulted in the Society getting in touch with the Royal Photographic Society in 1982 with a view of their providing an adjudicator. This they did and have continued to do so up to the present, resulting in our forging very close links with this world-renowned organisation.

In 1968 the Society only had one challenge trophy in its possession : The Society Challenge Cup, which was presented to the winner of the competitions held during the year. By 1980 the total had increased to 11 as the number of competitions and the number of sections in the annual exhibition increased. In 1985, the late Alex Perera presented a trophy he had made himself for the award of the title of Photographer of the Year to the person obtaining the highest aggregate of points in competitions during the course of the year. Today the total number of challenge trophies is 20!

The logo of the Society was designed by Mr A Harper in 1977 and the proof drawing made by Mr A Ryman MBE. Also in that year the Society made its first application for funds from the Government Cultural Grants Committee and succeeded in obtaining the sum of £90. Thanks to subsequent grants from this Committee, the Society has been able to purchase much needed equipment, and more recently for the purchase of books to help establish a good reference library. Also in 1977 first contacts were made with the Malta Photographic Society. This was the first of many such contacts with other clubs and societies, especially from U.K., with the view of exchanging ideas and holding competitions. In 1986 the Society became members of the Southern Photographic Federation of Great Britain, and through them affiliated to the Photographic Alliance of&amp;nbsp; Great Britain. As members of the SPF the Society has competed every year in their league competitions. Contacts with Spanish clubs in La Linea and Algeciras were established in 1984, and a few competitions and exhibitions have been held with them since then.

In 1981 the Society held its first basic course on photography, aimed at members who were beginners, but also opened to the general public. These successful courses have been kept up to the present.

In 1976 a need was felt for updating and extending the statute of the Society. A new statute was voted in April of that year. Minor revisions were made in 1982 and in 1983&amp;nbsp; with respect to classes of membership, and again in 1984 with respect to the use of the darkroom and equipment. In 1990 further changes were made with respect to the use of the Society’s equipment and premises, and lastly in 1994 with respect of classes of membership once again.

The 150th anniversary of the invention of photography was marked in1989 by the Society holding a special exhibition. For this exhibition copy prints of early historical photographs were purchased from the RPS, and exhibited together with hundreds of old and personal photographs loaned by members of the public, depicting family photos and old views of Gibraltar. The exhibition was a great success.

First enquiries on the acquisition of premises were made in 1985, and at the end of that year, during the opening of a special exhibition marking the 20th anniversary of the Society, the then Minister for Education Mr G Mascarenhas announced that we were being offered premises at Wellington Front.&amp;nbsp; These premises were officially handed over in January 1986, and works on refurbishing them commenced in April. By March 1987 the bulk of the works were over in the main hall, and the first Annual General Meeting held there that month. Works still continued in refurbishing the rest of the premises, and in fitting out a darkroom. The darkroom at John Mackintosh Hall was demolished in December 1989, and it was not till August 1990 that the one at Wellington Front became operational. The official opening of the premises was held on 26 November 1990, and carried out by H.E. the Governor Sir Derek Reffell. This coincided with the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Society. The acquisition of&amp;nbsp; the premises resulted in the Society being able to extend its activities without restrictions, and in the acquisition of the type of equipment which would have been impossible to obtain otherwise.

At present the Society is self-sufficient in terms of darkroom, audio-visual and studio facilities. The Society has also embraced the advent of digital imaging without any reservations; in all competitions digitally processed and manipulated images are accepted on a par with traditionally processed ones. With the help of awards from the Government Cultural Grants Committee, the Society has purchased three computers, two printers, two slides/negative scanner, a flat-bed scanner and a digital projector. In the programme of events for the year, a significant amount of time is dedicated to learning how to use imaging programmes, and the hardware.

=== Premises ===
The Society has premises which will shortly be refurbished in Summer 2015 at  Wellington Front, their mailing address  :

Wellington Front, PO Box 1422,  Gibraltar.

== Exhibition ==

'''Gisela Bock''' (born 1942 in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]]) is a German [[historian]]. She studied in Freiburg, Berlin, Paris and Rome. She took her doctorate at the [[Free University Berlin]] in 1971 (on early modern intellectual history in Italy) and her Habilitation at the [[Technical University Berlin]] in 1984. She has taught at the Free University Berlin (1971-1983) and was professor at the [[European University Institute]] (1985-1989) in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], at the [[University of Bielefeld]] (1989-1997) and then at the Free University Berlin. She retired in 2007.

In the 1970s, Bock was active in the international campaign for ''"wages for/against housework“'' and was one of the pioneers in the emergence and establishment of ''"women and gender"'' history. She was a co-founder of the International Federation for Research in Women's History (1987). Bock's best known works are her theoretical articles on gender history and the volume '''Women in European History''' (all published in many languages).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Published only in German, her 1986 book, ''Zwangssterilisation im Nationalsozialismus'' (Compulsory Sterilization in National Socialism), was a study of the 400,000 [[compulsory sterilization]]s performed in Nazi Germany on "genetically inferior" men and women. Bock examined the history of sterilization in [[Nazi Germany]] with respect to the perpetrators as well as the victims, both women and men. She showed how the treatment and the experience of male and female victims were both similar and different, and she argued that Nazi gender policy was shaped by Nazi racism just as Nazi race policy was shaped by gender. Bock also examined the Nazi sterilization policy as an integral part of the regime's population policy as well as a prelude to Nazi genocide.

'''Global surveillance whistleblowers''' are [[whistleblowers]] who provided public knowledge of [[global surveillance]].

==Perry Fellwock==
[[Perry Fellwock]] revealed the existence of then ultra secretive [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and its global mass surveillance apparatus and activities, including domestic spying, in a 1971 ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' exposé. This was the first wide exposure of the NSA, which had for decades prevented public knowledge of its abilities and activities. The revelations led the U.S. Senate [[Church Committee]] to introduce successful legislation intended to stop the NSA spying on American citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Adrian Chen|Chen, Adrian]] |title=After 30 Years of Silence, the Original NSA Whistleblower Looks Back |url=http://gawker.com/after-30-years-of-silence-the-original-nsa-whistleblow-1454865018 |date=November 12, 2013 |accessdate=2015-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RZZIrx96?url=http://gawker.com/after-30-years-of-silence-the-original-nsa-whistleblow-1454865018 |archivedate=2014-08-04 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russ Tice==
In December 2005 [[Russ Tice]] helped spark a national controversy over claims that the NSA and the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) were engaged in unlawful and unconstitutional [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]]s on American citizens. He later acknowledged that he was one of the sources that were used in ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporting on the wiretap activity in December 2005.&lt;ref name=abc2006&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Brian|title=NSA Whistleblower Alleges Illegal Spying|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1491889|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=9 August 2013|date=10 January 2006|quote=The same day ''The New York Times'' broke the story of the NSA eavesdropping without warrants, Tice surfaced as a whistleblower in the agency.

==Mark Klein==
[[Mark Klein]] is a former [[AT&amp;T]] technician who leaked knowledge of his company's cooperation with the NSA in installing network hardware to covertly monitor, [[Data Capture|capture]], and process American telecommunications en masse. The subsequent media coverage became a major story in May 2006.

In recognition of his actions, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) picked Klein as one of the winners of its 2008 [[EFF Pioneer Award|Pioneer Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = AT&amp;T Whistle-Blower Among Award Winners |first = Anick |last = Jesdanun |date = Feb 27, 2008 |work = |accessdate =Nov 27, 2011 |url=http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2008/02/27/1329579-att-whistle-blower-among-award-winners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over 22 years Mark Klein worked for AT&amp;T. Starting with the company as a Communications Technician in New York, where he remained from November 1981 until March 1991, he later continued in that capacity in California until 1998. From January 1998 to October 2003, Klein worked as a Computer Network Associate in San Francisco. From October 2003 to May 2004 he returned to the role of Communications Technician, after which he retired in May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Mark Klein, unredacted (June 8, 2006)|url=https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/att/SER_klein_decl.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a high-profile critic of his former employers during the [[George W. Bush]] administration, and was the subject of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigations, including a raid on his home in 2007. He came forward with NSA colleagues [[J. Kirk Wiebe]] and [[Edward Loomis]], in cooperation with [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] staffer [[Diane Roark]].

==Thomas Tamm==
[[Thomas Tamm]] is a former attorney in the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) [[Office of Intelligence Policy and Review]] (OIPR) during the period in 2004 when senior Justice officials fought against the widening scope of [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless NSA surveillance]] that consisted of eavesdropping on U.S. citizens. He was an anonymous whistleblower to ''The New York Times'', making the initial disclosure regarding the issue.

==Thomas Drake==
[[Thomas Andrews Drake]] is a former senior executive at the NSA, a decorated [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and [[United States Navy]] (USN) veteran, and a whistleblower. In 2010 the government alleged that Drake "mishandled" documents, one of the few such Espionage Act cases in U.S. history. Drake's defenders claim that he was instead being persecuted for challenging the [[Trailblazer Project]].&lt;ref name=shane3&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/us/16indict.html |title=Former N.S.A.

==Edward Snowden==
[[Edward Snowden]] is an American computer specialist, a former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) employee, who, while working as a [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] contractor, disclosed [[Classified information|top secret]] NSA documents to various media outlets, initiating the [[2013 Global surveillance disclosure|NSA leaks]], which reveal operational details of a [[global surveillance]] apparatus run by the NSA and other members of the [[Five Eyes]] alliance, along with numerous commercial and international partners.&lt;ref name="Der Spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Whistleblower Edward Snowden on Global Spying|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-whistleblower-edward-snowden-on-global-spying-a-910006.html|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=December 18, 2013|date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of classified material was called the most significant leak in US history by [[Pentagon Papers]] leaker [[Daniel Ellsberg]]. A [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures|series of exposés]] beginning June 5, 2013 revealed Internet surveillance programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[XKeyscore]], and [[Tempora]], as well as the interception of US and European telephone [[metadata]], among other disclosures.

'''Hindustani people''' or '''Hindavi people''' are an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] [[panethnicity]] living in the [[Hindi belt]] region of [[India]], which is located in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]] of [[North India]], between the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Vindhya Range|Vindhyas]] mountains. The word Hindustani was historically used for such inhabitants on genealogical, linguistic, or cultural grounds. In modern India, the Persianized Mughal era term Hindustani has slowly fallen out of use, as many North Indian ethnic groups moved closer to regional identities.

Traditionally, the Hindustani identity is primarily linguistic, with Hindustanis being those who have the historical [[Hindustani language]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]) or, in a broader sense, a [[varieties of Hindi|variety of Hindi]] as their [[primary language]], mainly residing in the present-day [[States and union territories of India|Indian states]] of [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Delhi]], [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]] and [[Bihar]].&lt;ref name=A&gt;Hudson, John C., ed., Goode’s World Atlas 20th Edition Chicago, Illinois, USA:2000—Rand McNally Map Page 203 Major Languages of India—map of the ethnolinguistic groups of India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CyItAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=HINDUSTANI+PEOPLE&amp;dq=HINDUSTANI+PEOPLE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mnMuTebnMIXtrQf4t-nWCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg Hidu writers constitute an overwhelming numbers of '''Hindustani people'''.

== Present circumstance == 

Although the word "Hindustani" refers to people, it is historically important to understand the complex history, culture, ethos and demography of the subcontinent. Certain groups of North Indians have multiple identities, with a more localised prioritised ethnic orientation, for example the [[Awadhi people]], [[Bhojpuri people]], [[Bagheli language|Bagheli]] people, [[Braj Bhasha|Braji]] people, [[Bundeli language|Bundeli]] people, [[Chhattisgarhi language|Chhattisgarhi]] people, [[Garhwali people]], [[Haryanvi language|Haryanvi]] people, [[Kumaoni people]], [[Malvi language|Malvi]] people,  [[Marwari people]], or [[Rajasthani people]], [[Magahi people]], [[Nagpuri people]], in addition to further tribal, village, and/or religious identities. However, whenever used, it is used to generally denote people whose native language is [[Hindustani language]] and in a broader sense a [[varieties of Hindi|variety of Hindi]] and belong to certain parts of North India (i.e. the [[Hindi belt]]).&lt;ref name=h/&gt;

The '''Jewish population of [[Abkhazia]]''' consisted of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]], [[Georgian Jews|Georgian]] and other Jews. It grew after the incorporation of Abkhazia into the [[Russian Empire]] in the middle of the 19th century. Most of the Jews left or were evacuated from Abkhazia as a result of the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|Georgian-Abkhazian conflict]] of 1992–1993.

A Russian garrison was installed in Sukhumi in the 1840s, as its fortress was part of the [[Black Sea defence line]], and Jews from many regions of Georgia, particularly from [[Kulashi]], settled in the town. As the 1897 census results indicate, there were also many Ashkenazi Jews in Sukhumi. A synagogue was built in the first decade of the 20th century.

In Soviet times, the Jewish population of Abkhazia increased greatly, but the [[Sukhumi]] Jewish community remained the largest in Abkhazia. According to the 1926 census, there were about 1,100 Jews in Abkhazia, most of them Ashkenazi (702) or Georgian (215).&lt;ref&gt;[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_26.php?reg=2346 1926 Census results, breakdown by ethnicities] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish community of Sukhumi was officially recognised by Soviet authorities in 1945, at the very end of [[World War II]]. Abkhazian Jews suffered like the other Jews of the Soviet Union during the massive anti-Jewish campaign in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Sukhumi synagogue was razed in October, 1951 (according to the official version, its territory was needed for urban development).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union|last= Ro'i|first= Yaacov|author2=Lili Baazova|year= 1995|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 0-7146-4619-9|pages= 291|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bJBH5pxzSyMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA292,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish population increased to about 3,500 in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethno-kavkaz.narod.ru/abkhyazik.html 1959, 1970, 1979 census results for Abkhazia, breakdown by mother tongues] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but many of them [[Aliyah from the Soviet Union in the 1970s|emigrated to Israel]] and elsewhere in the 1970s.

As the Soviet Union was disintegrating in the late 1980s, ethnic tensions began to grow in Abkhazia and the number of Jewish emigrants increased greatly. There were still many Jews in Abkhazia at the outbreak of the [[War in Abkhazia (1992-1993)|Georgian-Abkhaz War]] in August, 1992. All of the Jews who wished to flee the fledgling republic were evacuated by the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]] and settled in [[Israel]]. Most of the few who remained were Ashkenazi.&lt;ref name=forward&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forward.com/articles/163408/jewish-life-slowly-dying-in-abkhazia/ |title=Jewish Life Slowly Dying in Abkhazia |last=Edwards |first=Maxim |date=September 30, 2012 |work=[[The Forward]]  |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jewish Agency for Israel]], [http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/Russian/Home/About+us/Publications/SHEGOLEV.htm Interview with Lev Shchegolyov], {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Memorial (society)]], [http://www.memo.ru/hr/discrim/ethnic/abhaz/index.htm Положение беженцев из Абхазии в Краснодарском крае] (''Situation with the refugees from Abkhazia in Krasnodar Krai''), December, 2000 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=7-40/&gt; Those who remained had to endure the capture of [[Sukhumi]] by Abkhaz separatists and their allies.&lt;ref name=7-40/&gt;

'''Hungarian Studies''' is a field of study concerned with the [[Hungarian language]], [[Hungarian literature|literature]], [[ethnology]], [[Hungarian culture|culture]], [[Hungarian history|history]] or [[society]]. 

According to the current philosophy of Hungarian Studies, all these terrains that used to be treated as separate disciplines should be studied as a whole, with the subsequent fields in relation to each other. The study encompasses the scholars in Hungary, [[Hungarian diaspora|Hungarians outside of Hungary]], and foreign scholars conducting their research in other languages than Hungarian. Hungarian Studies as a discipline is intrinsically created by its intercultural circumstance from what it follows that the views and interpretations made from non-Hungarian standpoints are considered equally valid. Further, those Hungarian scholars that explore and interpret their own culture in the light of another culture inevitably apply Hungarian Studies informed standpoints.

The '''Kara''' are an ethnic group inhabiting [[South Sudan]] and the [[Central African Republic]]. They speak the [[Tar Gula language|Gula language]], which is a [[Central Sudanic]] language.

The Kara religion is an [[animist]] faith. As a population, they exceed 100,000 members. They mainly live in South Sudan's [[Western Bahr el Ghazal]] state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurtong.org/resourcecenter/people/profile_tribe.asp?TribeID=111 Gurtong Peace Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Daily life==
The Kara are a semi-nomadic people. They live in round huts made up of a framework of tree branches plastered with mud and the conical roof thatched with local grasses. A typical Kara village has 20 to 30 huts around a meeting place and also enclosures of branches to keep cattle and goats. The Kara tribe grow Sorghum, corn, beans, pumpkins and peanuts. The staples are Sorghum, made into a porridge either with milk or water, the latter eaten with a spicy stew of vegetables, and  milk, meat and blood. Meat is eaten on special occasions and milk and blood are drunk freely. Sorghum is also fermented to make beer. Men wear only a piece of cloth wound around the waist, knee high with an extra cloth slung over the shoulder, men always shave their head while women plait their hair into many braids and decorate them with beads. Women wear only a pleated cowskin skirt. Both sexes wear jewellery.

'''Kitty Marion''' (12 March 1871 – 9 October 1944) was a German-born actress and political activist. She was a prominent [[suffragette]] during the [[women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage movement in the United Kingdom]], and is notable for having endured more than 200 [[force-feeding]]s in prison while on [[hunger strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casciani|first=Dominic|title=Spy pictures of suffragettes revealed|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3153024.stm|work=BBC News Online|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After emigrating to the United States, she was again arrested on nine occasions – this time for [[birth control]] advocacy.

==Early years==
Katherina Maria Schafer was born in [[Rietberg]] in [[Westphalia]], Germany, on 12 March 1871. Her mother died of [[tuberculosis]] when the child was two, leaving Marion with her father. Four years later, when Marion was six, her step-mother also died of tuberculosis. Her father, whose name is not known, abused Marion and hated that she had red hair.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Viv Gardner, "Marion, Kitty (1871–1944)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48831, accessed 8 Nov 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; When Marion was fifteen, she was sent by her father to live with her aunt in England. 

==Career==
===Actress===
In England, she became an actress and took the name "Kitty Marion". She worked her way up from chorus to named parts and was briefly the temporary stand-in for the lead before she fell out with her employer. She then tried to find work in the music halls but found that employers expected sexual favours in exchange for the best work.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

===Activist===
Marion joined the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) in 1908. She became a prominent activist in the [[women's suffrage]] movement and often engaged in protests, which sometimes turned violent. Marion was known as 'a prolific bomber and arsonist for the suffragettes'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/fern-riddell/sanitising-suffragettes|title= Sanitising the Suffragettes - Fern Riddell - History Today|language=en|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-44210012&lt;/ref&gt; She was arrested numerous times in England for her activism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WmarionK.htm John Simkin, "Marion Kitty"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010094145/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WmarionK.htm |date=2011-10-10 }} at Spartacus Educational.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marion and Clara Elizabeth Giveen planned a reprisal after the death of [[Emily Davison]] at the Derby. On 13 June 1913, the two of them set alight to the [[Hurst Park]] Grandstand. Giveen was given three years in jail for arson but released under the [[Cat and Mouse Act]] after going on hunger strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp58990/clara-elizabeth-giveen|title=Clara Elizabeth Giveen - Person - National Portrait Gallery|website=www.npg.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marion was also released but she had been force-fed 232 times during her imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp58993/kitty-marion-katherina-maria-schafer|title=Kitty Marion (Katherina Maria Schafer) - Person - National Portrait Gallery|website=www.npg.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1914 Marion suffered some persecution for being German. [[Ada Wright]] together with [[Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence]], Lady [[Constance Lytton]] and [[Rose Lamartine Yates]] raised the money to pay her fare to emigrate to the United States, to avoid the anti-German sentiment in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Crawford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crawford|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866-1928|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=760|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=a2EK9P7-ZMsC&amp;pg=PA760|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the U.S., she worked with [[Margaret Sanger]] in publishing the ''[[Birth Control Review]]''.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Marion sold the ''Review'' at {{USD|.20}} per copy in [[Times Square]], [[Grand Central Station]], and [[Coney Island]].  Standing on street corners, she endured [[Heckler|heckling]], death threats, physical abuse, and police harassment.  Over the course of ten years, Marion was arrested nine times for her [[birth control]] advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Engelman, pp. 99–101.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Marion joined Sanger in establishing the first birth-control clinic in the U.S. Located in [[Brooklyn]], it was closed by the police.

Marion died in the Sanger Nursing Home in [[New York City]] on 9 October 1944.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

{{about|the Lumbwa people of East Africa before and during the Maasai era|the Lumbwa of colonial and post-independent Kenya|Kipsigis people|the Wakwavi of Tanzania|Kwavi people}}
[[image:Lumbwa woman and girl, showing dress and ear and other ornaments.jpg|thumb|right|Lumbwa woman and girl, showing dress and ear and other ornaments, ca. 1910, western Kenya]]
The '''Lumbwa''' (also Lumbua, Umpua, Humba and Wakwavi) were a pastoralist community inhabiting southern and northern portions of [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]] respectively. The term Lumbwa was used in reference to sections of the Maa-speaking [[Loikop people|Loikop]] communities from at least the mid-19th century but also and commonly to the Kalenjin speaking [[Kipsigis people|Kipsgis]] community for much of the late 19th to mid 20th century.

==Sources &amp; historiography==
===Early missionary sources &amp; oral accounts===
The journals, letters and published articles of the first three missionaries of the Church Missionary Society in East Africa; i.e. Johann Ludwig Krapf, Johannes Rebmann and Jakob Erhardt written during the 1840s and 1850s contain the earliest references to the Lumbwa&lt;ref&gt;Falola, T., &amp; Jennings, C., Sources and Methods in African History: Spoken, Written, Unearthed p.173-174 [[https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=CS5tHpdMMa4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online]]&lt;/ref&gt; though certain Meru&lt;ref&gt;Fadiman, J., When We Began There Were Witchmen, University of California Press, 1994, p.82 [[https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft8199p24c;brand=ucpress online]]&lt;/ref&gt; traditions point to even earlier use of the term in reference to an East African pastoralist community.

Krapf arrived at the East African coast in December 1843 and made his first foray into the hinterland in January 1844, whereupon he immediately came across reports of the nearby "Okooafee" and their southern neighbors the "Quapee". Within a year he had worked out that these two groups were in fact the same people at which time he began referring to them as '''Wakuafi''' in his writings. In 1852 he learned that the Wakuafi referred to themselves by the name '''Iloikop'''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Falola, T., &amp; Jennings, C., Sources and Methods in African History: Spoken, Written, Unearthed p.174&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the Swahili name Wakuafi was used to represent all Iloikop peoples though it later narrowed to represent only the non-Maasai sections of Iloikop. It is suggested that the term '''Humba (or Lumbwa)''' was likewise a Bantu word used by Bantu of the interior in reference to the same group of pastoralists.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  

===Later accounts &amp; interpretations of early missionary sources===
====Late 19th century====
The accounts of missionaries and explorers in the 1870's and 80's generally concurred with the writings of the early missionaries though distinctions between Maasai, Wakwavi and Lumbwa begin appearing in the writings. 

In his early accounts, Thomas Wakefield wrote of the "poor Wakwavi...having long since been robbed of their cattle by the Maasai, were compelled to turn their attention to agricultural pursuits" and in the same account gives a distinction between Wakwavi and Kipsigis stating that "the Wakwavi of Ndara Serian" continued to raid Lumbwa (Kipsigis) for cattle. Charles New in 1873 also concurred with his predecesors assertion that both Maasai and 'Wakuavi' called themselves Orloikob which he translated as "possessors of the soil" and that both groups were pastoralists. James Last who was stationed at Mamboia in central Tanzania during the 1880's also concluded as Krapf had done that "Humba" was an equivalent term for "Kwavi". He also concurred with earlier descriptions of both peoples as pastoralists.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====Joseph Thompson's account====
Joseph Thompson in his account ''Through Maasai Land'' which was published in 1887 made an observation that was a subtle but significant departure from previous accounts, he noted about the country "...however, we are including several isolated areas occupied either by tribes wholly different from the Masai, or by the agricultural Wa-kwafi, who are mere off-shoots of the Masai," thus inverting previous understanding of Wakwavi/Maasai relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J., Through Maasai land: A journey of exploration among the snow clad volcanic mountains and strange tribes, Royal Geographic Society p.238 [[https://archive.org/details/throughmasailand01thomuoft/page/n7 online]]&lt;/ref&gt; This inversion of the order laid out by Krapf, Rebmann and other explorers would become the standard interpretation in years to come, possibly as a result of actual changes on the ground brought about by the reduction of the larger Iloikop society to mere scatterlings and the consequent subsumption of the larger Iloikop identity by the Maasai.&lt;ref&gt;Falola, T., &amp; Jennings, C., Sources and Methods in African History: Spoken, Written, Unearthed p.186-187&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early 20th century====
By the early 20th century, Maasai identity was distinct apart from Wakwavi though they were still unclear about the distinction between Iloikop and Lumbwa. Thomas Wakefield in his accounts published in 1904, distinguishes the Wakwavi and Maasai stating 'the Wakwavi and Maasai are cognate races, but mutually hostile. They are alike in physique, manners and customs, modes of life, weapons and war, and spend their time in cattle-lifting and in murdering all who happen to fall across their war path. They are not always distinguished by the natives about here, "Wakwavi" being almost the synonym for "Maasai" and vice-versa."&lt;ref&gt;Wakefield, T., Missionary &amp; Geographical Pioneer in East Equatorial Africa, 1904 p.80 [[https://archive.org/stream/thomaswakefieldm00wake/thomaswakefieldm00wake_djvu.txt online]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A.C.Hollis writing on the Maasai in 1905 identifies two divisions among the Maasai; some living in British territory and "who called themselves Il-Maasae" and another section "...who were called 'L-Oikop or Il-Lumbwa [who] lived in German East Africa" as agriculturalists.&lt;ref&gt;Falola, T., &amp; Jennings, C., Sources and Methods in African History: Spoken, Written, Unearthed p.188&lt;/ref&gt; In his account of the Nandi, published also in 1905, he notes extensively that the Nandi referred to the Kipsigis as Lumbwa.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;A. C. Hollis.  ''[https://archive.org/details/cu31924029888777 The Nandi: Their Language and Folklore]''.  Clarendon Press: Oxford 1909, p.306&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary interpretations===
The focus of some contemporary scholarly accounts touching on the Lumbwa is the distinction between Maasai and Iloikop where the Maasai-centric understanding of Iloikop identity is being challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Falola, T., &amp; Jennings, C., Sources and Methods in African History: Spoken, Written, Unearthed p.173&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Etymology==
It has been suggested by various authors that the term '''Humba (or Lumbwa)''' was a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] word used by Bantu of the East African hinterland in reference to Iloikop pastoralists.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The names recalled in [[Meru people|Meru]] tradition i.e. "Umpua," "Umbua," "Mbumbua," and "Lumbua" all sound like reasonable variations of Lumbwa though the strongest evidence linking the Meru Umpua to the Lumbwa is language (below).&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Fadiman, J., When We Began There Were Witchmen, University of California Press, 1994, p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

It is at this time unclear what the Lumbwa referred to themselves as, though one of the more common Kalenjin origin tales, mentions that the pre-Kalenjin grouping that comprised the Kipsigis, Nandi, Tugen and possibly Keiyo was known as Myoot (or Miot), a term that is today used by the Kalenjin council of elders.&lt;ref&gt;Myoot (Tugen, Keiyo, Marakwet, Kipsigis, Nandi, Sebei, Pokot, Terik) Culture and Heritage.[[http://www.myoot.co.ke/ online]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Way of Life==
{{see also|Sirikwa people}}
===Pastoralism===
Fosbrooke who conducted many interviews among the Maasai in various parts of East Africa in the decade to 1948, noted that his informants told him repeatedly that they shared a common pastoralist origin with the "Lumbwa" who they told him had only recently taken up agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Falola, T., &amp; Jennings, C., Sources and Methods in African History: Spoken, Written, Unearthed p.189&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cattle pens====
The archaeological/landscape feature commonly referred to as [[Sirikwa holes]] are found in Meru where they are known as "Agumba holes". 

Traditions captured in Igoji and Imenti associate these with the Umpua of that area, cattle keepers who kept livestock in pits at night. These holes were dug by the herders themselves and were gradually deepened as mud was removed after the rains.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Appearance===
Igoji and Imenti informants in Meru recall that the Umpua were "tall, slender, cattle keeping people [who] wore shoulder-length hair, plaited into braids.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Language===
In 1969 in Mwimbi, Meru, an aged informant claimed to remember four Umpua words which had been sung in songs about the Umpua when he was a child. These were agenge, uii, chito and ngeta; meaning one, two and the last two both meaning man. These words largely have the same meaning in Okiek and to a lesser extent modern Kalenjin.&lt;ref&gt;Fadiman, J., When We Began There Were Witchmen, University of California Press, 1994, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispersal==
===Kipsigis===
{{main|Kipsigis people}}
Prior to and through the early 20th century, the Kipsigis people were referred to as Lumbwa by the Nandi and other Kalenjin speakers.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; 

===Nandi===
{{main|Settlement of Nandi}}
In the account of the settlement and formation of the Nandi community, two streams of clans are said to have come from Lumbwa. The initial group forms part of the first stream of settlers in Nandi and includes the Kipamwi, Kipkenda and Kipiegen along with the Kipoiis who came from Elgon. The second stream came purely from Lumbwa and includes the Tungo, Kipaa, Kipasiso and Kapchemuri (Chemuri) and the Elgoni (Kony)&lt;ref&gt;Huntingford, G.W.B, ''[https://archive.org/stream/cbarchive_102057_remarksuponthehistoryofthenand1927/No._28_3_1927_Huntingford_djvu.txt Remarks upon the history of the Nandi]'', 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kwavi===

The Kwavi of Tanzani are often called Lumbwa

The '''Majang language''' is spoken by the [[Majangir]] people of [[Ethiopia]]. Although it is a member of the [[Surmic]] cluster, this language is the most isolated one in that cluster (Fleming 1983).  A [[language survey]] has shown that dialect variation from north to south is minor and does not seriously impede communication. The 2007 Ethiopian Census lists 6,433 speakers for Majang (Messengo), but also reports that the ethnic group consists of 32,822 individuals (Messengo and Mejengir).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/images/documents/pdf_files/regional/CountryLevel.pdf 2007 Census countrywide]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the census, almost no speakers can be found in [[Mezhenger Zone]] of [[Gambela Region]]; a total of eleven speakers are listed for the zone, but almost 10,000 ethnic Mejenger or Messengo people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/images/documents/pdf_files/regional/Gambela.pdf 2007 Census Gambella Region]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowel length is distinctive in Majang, so all vowels come in pairs of long and short, such as ''goopan'' 'punishment' and ''gopan'' 'road'. The vowel inventory is taken out of Joswig (2012) and Getachew (2014, p.&amp;nbsp;65). Unseth (2007) posed a 9-vowel system with a row of -ATR closed vowels '''ɪ''' and '''ʊ'''. Moges &lt;ref&gt;Moges (2007), p.114&lt;/ref&gt; claims a tenth vowel '''ɐ''', whereas Bender (1983) was only ready to confirm six vowels. All authors agree that there is no ATR vowel harmony in the language.

Bender&lt;ref&gt;Bender (1983), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; also claims that the glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} needs to be treated as a phoneme of Majang though Unseth refutes this.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth(1991), p. 533&lt;/ref&gt; Majang has two [[Implosive consonants|implosives]], bilabial and coronal, which Moges Yigezu has studied acoustically and distributionally.&lt;ref&gt;Moges Yigezu. 2006.

===Prosodic Features===
Tones distinguish meaning in Majang,&lt;ref&gt;Bender (1983), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; on both the word level and the grammatical level: ''táŋ'' (higher tone) 'cow', ''tàŋ'' (lower tone) 'abscess'. The tonal inventory consists of two tone levels, with falling and rising contour tones possible at the end of phonological words, plus automatic and non-automatic downstep. &lt;ref&gt;Joswig 2015b&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==
The language has markers to indicate three different past tenses (close, mid, far past) and two future tenses (near and farther).&lt;ref&gt;Bender (1983), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The language has a wide variety of suffixes, but almost no prefixes.  Though its use is limited to a handful of roots, there are a few words that preserve vestiges of the archaic causative prefix ''i-'', a prefix found in other Surmic languages and also [[Nilotic]].&lt;ref&gt;Unseth (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The counting system is a modified [[vigesimal]] system, based on 5, 10, and 20. "Twenty" is 'one complete person' (all fingers and toes), so 40 is 'two complete people', 100 is 'five complete people'.  However, today, under the influence of schools and increased bilingualism, people generally use the [[Amharic]] or [[Oromo language|Oromo]] words for 100.

The person and number marking system does not mark the [[inclusive and exclusive we]] distinction,&lt;ref&gt;Bender (1983), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; a morphological category that is found in nearby and related languages.

==Syntax==
Majang has a basic VSO word order,&lt;ref&gt;Getachew 2014, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; though allowing some flexibility for focus, etc. The language makes extensive use of [[relative clause]]s, including for circumstances where English would use [[adjective]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth(1989)&lt;/ref&gt;
A recent study&lt;ref&gt;Joswig (2015a)&lt;/ref&gt; states that Majang is characterized by a strong morphological [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative-absolutive system]], and a conjoint-disjoint distinction which is based on the presence or absence of an [[absolutive case|absolutive]] [[noun phrase]] directly following the [[verb]]. Many of these distinctions are coded by tonal differences.&lt;ref&gt;Joswig (2015a)&lt;/ref&gt;

Majang, and some related Surmic languages, has been shown to be exceptional to some syntactic typological predictions for languages with [[Subject–verb–object]] word order.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Arensen, Nicky de Jong, Scott Randal, Peter Unseth. 1997. Interrogatives in Surmic Languages and Greenberg's Universals. ''Occasional Papers in the Study of Sudanese Languages'' 7:71-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Majang has postpositions and question words sentence-finally, two properties that had been predicted to not occur in languages with VSO word order.

'''Penangite Indians''' ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]: ''Kaum India di Pulau Pinang'', [[Tamil language|Tamil]]:''பினாங்கு இந்தியர்கள்''), also known as '''Chulias''' are [[Malaysian Indian]]s that live primarily in the state of [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]]. Most are the descendants from those who migrated from India during the [[British Malaya|British colonisation of Malaya]]. However, historical sources prove that the ancient Indians arrived in Penang during the [[Chola dynasty]]. Today, the Penangite Indians are one of the most successful ethnic groups in Penang state and whole of Malaysia. Penangite Indians forms a large percentage of the state's professional labours such as business, law and medicine as well as politics, it can be proved by the appointment of [[P.Ramasamy|Dr P.Ramasamy]] as deputy chief minister of Penang. It made him the first Malaysian of Indian origin to hold the post of deputy chief minister in any state of Malaysia.&lt;ref name="from critic"&gt;{{Cite news

{{Main article|Malaysian Indian}}
Already in the 1790s, Light mentions Chulias (that is, people from the [[Coromandel Coast]] of India) as shopkeepers and farm labourers in Penang. Light estimated that about two thousand men came to work in this manner each year. however, in contrast to the Chinese, these labourers did not create a permanent settlement in Penang. They would, rather, work long enough to save money and then return to their families in south India. This group of migrants comprised the ‘Adi Dravidas,’ a group of impoverished labourers originating in the hinterlands of the Tamil country and Andhra Desa who, facing insufficient work in their homeland, went abroad for survival.

Another class of Indian migrants was a class of people hailing from the Kaveri delta areas (from the Sivaganga district of Madras) known as ‘Nattukottai Chettiars’ who were by occupation money-lenders. Their presence in Penang and elsewhere where plantations sprang up aided merchants, miners, and planters, as these Chettiars were advancing required working capital in the absence of any effective banks. Light also encouraged migration by the Chettiar community as part of his plan to create a cash economy on Penang.

Unlike the Tamil migrants, Telugu migrants from the northern Coromandel Coast came to Penang as families. For this reason, many did not leave when their work terms expired, but rather continued working on plantations or as merchants. Over 1,500,000 south Indians who worked in Malayan plantations, more than three-fourths returned to India, nearly all of them Tamil.

As a result of the occupayion of Malaysia, the Japanese killed about 150,000+ Indian Tamils of Malaysia and Burma in Burma within a period of time after arriving for slave labour work of constructing the Myanamr rail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The real Kwai killed over 1.50 lakh Tamils|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/The-real-Kwai-killed-over-1.50-lakh-Tamils/article14593113.ece|work=The Hindu|date=27 August 2016|accessdate=30 January 2017}} Retrieved 30 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with Light, Penang boasted a tradition of religious and ethnic tolerance. All races could practice their respective religious faith and social stability in a multi-racial society was thus achieved.

==Language==
{{Main article|Tamil Language|Malaysian Tamil|Tanglish}}
The main language spoken by Indians in Penang is [[Malaysian Tamil]] dialect of [[Tamil language]] in addition to the country's official and national language [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] ([[English language|English]] is also widely spoken and understood). Besides Tamil, [[Urdu language|Urdu]] is also spoken by a small number of Indian Muslims and  [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as well as [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is also spoken by ethnic [[Telugu people|Telugu]] and [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] community.

{{Main article|Thaipusam}}
One of the biggest festivals in Penang is a Hindu religious festival called [[Thaipusam]]. Thaipusam is dedicated to the lord [[Murugan]]. [[Deepavali]], better known as the 'Festival of Lights', is another major Hindu festival celebrated by all Hindus. Tamils celebrate the harvest festival of [[Pongal]], which is usually held 13 to 16 January. Similar celebrations, known as Makar Sankranti is celebrated by most other Indian communities and Punjabis called them as Lohri. While Indian Christians celebrate Christmas Day and Good Friday. Indian Muslims, Jawi Peranakans and Mamaks celebrates [[Eid Al Fitr]] and [[Eid Al Adha]] along with the country's other Muslim groups like their ethnic [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]] counterparts.

==== Teppa Tiruvizla ====
Teppa Tiruvizla or floating chariot festival is consider as one of the most important festival in Penang after Thaipusam. The annual festival hosted by Sri Singhamuga Kaliamman Temple at [[Teluk Bahang]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2016/02/25/keeping-hopes-adrift-devotees-send-out-prayers-via-candlelit-floats/|title=Keeping hopes adrift  - Metro News - The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2014/02/17/sea-off-teluk-bahang-lights-up-during-temple-festival/|title=Sea off Teluk Bahang lights up during temple festival - Nation - The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A celebration to thank the goddess, [[Kali Amman|Sri Singhamuga Kaliamman]], for her good grace and to beseech her to continue providing devotees with protection and prosperity, Teppa Tiruvizla only takes place during Masi Magam, the 11th month1 in the Tamil calendar. It is a day when temple idols are taken out for a ceremonial bath. Thousands travel from all over Malaysia to take part in the festivities.

The day begins with morning prayers; the devotees who attend bring milk as an offering to the goddess. In the afternoon, the floating chariot is carefully pushed into the sea by temple president Sadha Sivam, the youth club members and other temple members. Later, after evening prayers, the idol of the goddess is carried to the chariot

===Literature===
he first known Tamil magazine called Thangai Nesan was published in 1876. Two other magazines Ulaka Nesan and Hindu Nesan were published in 1887 and 1888 respectively. We also know that in 1887 a book entitled Sathiya Vedha Sarithira Saaram (The Essence of the Bible) by Palavendhiram Rayappan was published here. In 1890 Pathaanandha Maalai (A garland of Praise) was published by Mohamed Sultan Maraikkayar. (A list of early books provided.)
Many of these books and magazines were produced by Indian immigrants and much of the literary output was in the form of poetry and some of the notable poets of recent times were Swami Ramadasar, Panaikkulam M. Abdul Majid and N.Karim. This tradition continues today with home-grown writers and poets.
In the early fifties Tamil Murasu, a Singapore Tamil daily, began a student supplement called Maanavar Manimandra Malar (Supplement for Students Bell Club). This served as a training ground for budding writers in Tamil. The Thamilar Thirunaal (Tamils Festival, also sponsored by this daily, provided motivation and training for writers with its various literary competitions.

Following these examples, several- associations were formed in Penang to promote and nourish Tamil writing. Among them were the Tamil Youth Bell Club, Valluvar Debating Society, Bharathi Debating Society, the Senthamizh Kala Nilayam and North Malaya Tamil Writers Association.

Poetry can be said to be the most. prolific of the literary output. (A list of significant poets and poetry provided.) Following this is the significant production of short stories. The Penang-based writers’ list is long, but among them are Murugaiyan, Dato P. Shanmugam, A. Kadir, CT. Ramasamy, Anthony Muthu, S. Anbanantham, M. Sultan etc. (List provided.)

Significant contribution from Penang to Malaysian Tamil literature includes writings of K. Sonaimuthu with several of his biographies and essays, and R. Karthigesu with his novels. While writers like Karthigesu and Seeni Naina Mohamed came into Penang from other states, Penang has also lost some of its illustrious writers like M. Asan Gani, M. Sultan, and Karaikizhaar to other states.

A current list of writers is appended. Almost all the writers in our list belong to an older generation, and it is a thing of great concern that writers from the younger generation are scarce.

==Education==
The first Tamil vernacular schools in Malaya (now Malaysia) was set up in Penang under the Labour Code. In 2014, the Penang government brought a motion to open the first Tamil vernacular secondary school in Malaysia at Penang. But for political reasons this proposal was rejected by the central government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140302202725/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/putrajaya-shoots-down-tamil-secondary-school-proposal-in-penang ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Malaysians also form the bulk of English teachers in Penang. Law and medicine has traditionally been a preferred career option by Indian families although younger Indians now venturing into other fields such as engineering, finance and entrepreneurship

Established in 1976, the '''Marine Life Society of South Australia''' is a long-standing incorporated association which aims to foster the study and appreciation of [[marine life]] and encourage [[marine conservation]] engagement in [[South Australia]]. The society's most notable recent achievement was the statewide protection of all [[Syngnathidae]] (including the [[Leafy sea dragon]], [[Weedy sea dragon]], [[pipefish]] and [[seahorses]]) under the State's Fisheries Management Act. This was driven by concerns that the animals could become targeted by aquarium keepers and poachers looking to exploit the species for the aquarium trade.

== Aims &amp; objectives ==
# To foster the study of marine life
# To promote education and public awareness of all life in the sea
# To encourage the conservation and protection of the marine environment

== Achievements ==
In February 2006, Minister for Fisheries [[Rory McEwen (politician)|Rory McEwen]] announced the protection of all Syngnathidae in South Australian waters under the Fisheries Management Act. The decision was the result of club President Philip Hall's direct representation to the State Premier, [[Mike Rann]] during a Community Cabinet meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Philip [http://www.mlssa.asn.au/cgi-bin/Publications.cgi?topic=nletters/MLSSA_NL_331_April_2006.htm&amp;hash=1 "State Government to protect sea dragons and sea horses"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506064012/http://www.mlssa.asn.au/cgi-bin/Publications.cgi?topic=nletters%2FMLSSA_NL_331_April_2006.htm&amp;hash=1 |date=2013-05-06 }} ''MLSSA'' Newsletter 331, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the society took a more outward facing approach than in previous years, presenting the inaugural Whyalla Underwater Shootout photography competition and an art exhibition at [[Port Noarlunga]]. The Society also responded to a variety of marine conservation issues including the potential impact of shipping noise on the giant Australian cuttlefish aggregation of Upper Spencer Gulf&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.whyallanewsonline.com.au/story/2772970/report-cuttlefish-stressed-by-shipping/|title = Report: cuttlefish stressed by shipping|last = |first = |date = 2014-12-18|work = |accessdate = 2014-12-19|newspaper = Whyalla News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a mass stranding of [[sperm whale|sperm whales]] at [[Ardrossan]], Yorke Peninsula in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://mlssa.org.au/2014/12/10/propeller-strike-evidence-found-on-dead-sperm-whale-near-ardrossan-december-8-2014/|title = Propeller strike evidence found on dead Sperm whale near Ardrossan, December 8 2014|date = 2014-12-10|accessdate = 2014-12-19|website = Marine Life Society of South Australia|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marine Life Society was also represented at Adelaide rallies and events held in opposition to the [[Western Australian shark cull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://mlssa.org.au/2014/09/05/thoughts-from-adelaides-second-rally-against-the-western-australian-shark-cull/|title = Thoughts from Adelaide’s second rally against the Western Australian Shark Cull|date = 2014-09-05|accessdate = 2014-12-19|website = Marine Life Society of South Australia|publisher = |last = Monceaux|first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current projects ==
The Society's current projects include the preparation of a ''Beach Wash Guide'', designed to help beach-combers identify and learn about organisms sighted or collected from South Australian beaches. As of 2013, the guide has been under development for 14 years.

The society also produces an annual calendar featuring photographs of South Australian marine life taken by its members. The calendars are sold as a [[fundraising]] and outreach exercise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/SA-Marine-Life-Calendars-by-the-Marine-Life-Society-of-South-Australia/238264916242379?ref=profile "SA Marine Life Calendars by the Marine Life Society of South Australia"] ''Facebook.com'' (accessed 2013-12-13)&lt;/ref&gt; The society also hosts an online photo index of species native to South Australian waters on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlssa.asn.au/marine.html The MLSSA Marine Photographic Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126063728/http://www.mlssa.asn.au/marine.html |date=2014-01-26 }} (accessed 2013-12-14)&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, a once-off grant to the ''Marine Discovery Centre'' at the [[Star of the Sea Catholic Primary School|Star of the Sea School]] was approved by the Committee to sponsor the design, production and establishment of three outdoor interpretive signs. The project is intended to provide information on the need for 'catchment to coast' care. At the time, it was the largest grant ever made by the Society.

== Species of conservation concern ==
Since 2006, the Society's priority species of conservation concern have become the [[Western blue groper]] (Achoerodus gouldii) and the Harlequin fish (Othox dentex). As of 2014, the society is developing a number of position statements on a variety of marine conservation matters.
[[File:Fishes3Mitchell1850.jpg|thumb|311x311px|Western Blue Groper (Achoerodus gouldii)]]

== Resources ==
The society published a monthly newsletter and an annual journal until 2014. An archive of past issues is available at the Society's website, dating back to the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlssa.asn.au/cgi-bin/Newsletters.cgi "Newsletters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126063736/http://www.mlssa.asn.au/cgi-bin/Newsletters.cgi |date=2014-01-26 }} ''MLSSA ''(accessed 2013-12-14)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the newsletter was discontinued in favour of posting articles online.

The society has an extensive library of publications relevant to South Australian marine life which are available to members.

== Sponsorships &amp; Patronage ==
The society is both a sponsor of and a recipient of sponsorship from other organisations. The society's patron is published author and marine scientist, Scoresby Shepherd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardi.sa.gov.au/staff_profiles/business_services__and__executive/dr_scoresby_shepherd SARDI Aquatic Sciences &gt; Dr Scoresby Shepherd, Senior Research Fellow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219005138/http://www.sardi.sa.gov.au/staff_profiles/business_services__and__executive/dr_scoresby_shepherd |date=2013-12-19 }} Accessed 2013-12-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Market-preserving federalism''' is a special type of [[federalism]] that limits the degree to which a country’s political system can encroach upon its markets. &lt;ref name= weingast&gt;{{Citation | last = Weingast | first = Barry | author-link = Barry R. Weingast | title = The Economic Role of Political Institutions: Market-Preserving Federalism and Economic Development | journal = Journal of Law, Economics, &amp; Organization | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 1–31 | year = 1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;Weingast notes that there is a fundamental dilemma facing a government attempting to build and protect markets: the government must be strong enough to protect property rights and enforce contracts, but weak enough to credibly commit the state to honoring such rules. &lt;ref name=weingast /&gt; 

Market-preserving federalism is a means by which some countries address the fundamental dilemma of government. By decentralizing the authority to make economic policies, market-preserving federalism reduces the ability of both the central government to act arbitrarily (it has given up these powers) and the subnational governments (they face competition with one another for scarce capital and labor). 

Montinola, Qian, and Weingast argue that this form of federalism was critical for the success of China's reforms in the early 1980s.

== Conditions for market-preserving federalism ==

Montinola, Qian, and Weingast identify a set of five conditions that represent an ideal type of institutional arrangement for market-preserving federalism (italics in original). &lt;ref name = montinola&gt; {{Citation | last = Montinola | first = Gabriella | author-link = Gabriella Montinola |
last2 = Qian | first2 = Yingyi | author2-link = Yingyi Qian |
last3 = Weingast | first3 = Barry | author3-link = Barry R. Weingast |
title = Federalism, Chinese style: The political basis for economic success in China | 
journal = World Politics | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | year = 1995 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

(F1) There exists a hierarchy of governments with a ''delineated scope of authority'' (for example, between the national and subnational governments) so that each government is autonomous in its own sphere of authority.

(F2) The subnational governments have primary ''authority over the economy'' within their jurisdictions.  

(F3) The national government has the authority to police the ''common market'' and to ensure the mobility of goods and factors across subgovernment jurisdictions. 

(F4) Revenue sharing among governments is limited and borrowing by governments is constrained so that all governments face ''hard budget constraints''. 

(F5) The allocation of authority and responsibility has an ''institutionalized degree of durability'' so that it cannot be altered by the national government either unilaterally or under the pressures from subnational governments.

While condition F1 is the defining feature of federalism, conditions two through five are required to ensure federalism’s market-preserving qualities. &lt;ref name= montinola /&gt; Federal systems that fail to satisfy these five conditions generally do not sustain markets and economic development; for example, Argentina, India, and Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5585">'''Max Friedrich Meyer''' (June 14, 1873 – March 14, 1967) was a German-born American psychologist.

Meyer was born in [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] as the son of a goldsmith. He relocated to the USA and became Professor of [[Experimental Psychology]] (and initiator of the Psychology Department) of the [[University of Missouri]]. His work largely concerned neurology and its relationship to behavior. He was also co-developer of the [[Lipps–Meyer law]] (concerning melodic intervals of music). He was dismissed from the University of Missouri due to his academic involvement with a scandalous questionnaire (concerning opinions about marriage and sex) issued as a project by Meyer's student, [[Orval Hobart Mowrer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Nelson, Lawrence J. | title=Rumors of Indiscretion: The University of Missouri "Sex Questionnaire" Scandal in the Jazz Age | location=Columbia, MO | publisher=University of Missouri Press | year=2003 | isbn=0-8262-1449-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was subsequently censured by the [[American Association of University Professors]]—an early case regarding academic freedom due a professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = A.J.

Meyer invented the [[tonality diamond]], popularized by the theories of composer [[Harry Partch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrysalis-foundation.org/Meyer-s_Diamond.htm "Musical Mathematics: Meyer's Diamond"], ''Chrysalis-Foundation.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the 1930 President of the Midwestern Psychological Association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://midwesternpsych.org/about/presidents.php | title = MPA Presidents and Meeting Locations | accessdate = 2010-11-15 | publisher = Midwestern Psychological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1930 President of the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://southernsociety.org/pastofficers.htm |title=PAST OFFICERS |accessdate=2010-11-15 |publisher=Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420154637/http://southernsociety.org/pastofficers.htm |archivedate=2015-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was identified as one of the most important psychologists of the period 1600–1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Edith L.

The '''Mishar Tatars''' (self definition: мишәрләр,  мишәр татарлары) are a subgroup of the [[Volga Tatars]] of [[Tatars]] and the indigenous people of the [[Mordovia]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Bashkortostan]],  and [[Chuvashia]] of Russian Federation, [[Penza Oblast|Penza]], [[Ulyanovsk Oblast|Ulyanovsk]], [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Samara Oblast|Samara]], [[Volgograd Oblast|Volgograd]], [[Saratov Oblast|Saratov]] Oblasts of Russia and immigrant minority of [[Finland]]. The majority of [[Finnish Tatars]] are Mishar Tatars. The [[Mishar Tatar dialect]] is one of the two [[Tatar language|Volga Tatar]] dialects.

== History ==
They are descendants of [[Cuman]]-[[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] tribes who mixed with the [[Burtas]] in the Middle [[Oka River]] area and Meschiora. The origin of Mishar Tatars of [[Mishar Yurt]] are [[Meshchera]] (Meshcherian), a [[Mordvinic languages]]-speaking [[Mokshas|Moksha]] [[Mordvins]] of [[Mukhsha Ulus]] who came under Tatar influence and adopted the language and the Sunni Muslim religion.&lt;ref&gt;M.

'''NRK Sápmi''' (previously '''NRK Sámi Radio''') is a unit of the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NRK) that produces [[Sami languages|Sami-language]] news and other programs for broadcast to the [[Sami people]] of [[Norway]] via radio, television, and internet. Regular radio news programs in Sami began in 1946, presented from [[Tromsø]] by the teacher Kathrine Johnsen (1917–2002), remembered today as "Sami Radio's Mother".&lt;ref&gt;[https://nbl.snl.no/Kathrine_Johnsen Kathrine Johnsen in the Norsk Biografisk Leksikon] (in Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1976, NRK Sámi Radio moved to [[Kárášjohka]] (Karasjok), and in 1984 to its current headquarters (also in Kárášjohka). NRK Sápmi has about 17 journalists based in [[Deatnu]] (Tana), [[Guovdageaidnu]] (Kautokeino), Olmmaivaggi in [[Gáivuotna]], Tromsø, [[Skånland]], [[Tysfjord]], [[Snåsa]], and [[Oslo]]. Approximately 60 people are employed at the unit's headquarters.

NRK Sápmi broadcasts on FM radio in [[Finnmark]] County and in [[Oslo]]. The channel is also available nationwide on DAB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.nrk.no/sapmi/om/1._about-nrk-sapmi-1.11296850 | title =About NRK Sápmi | date =2013-10-14 | website =Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation | publisher =NRK | access-date =2017-01-31 | quote =NRK Sápmi broadcasts 246 hours of TV, 1754 of FM-radio, and 6545 hours on digital radio (DAB)/inline radio per year (2012). }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

* Oduduwa is the power of the womb, that brings forth into existence
* Oduduwa represents omnipotence, the ability to affect and reconstruct the physical reality at will.
* Oduduwa - odu da uwa - odu to da iwa - the principle that created the physical reality

==Narrative==

===Settlement===
{{Main| Yoruba people}}
According to early historians, Oduduwa was an exiled prince of a foreign people who left his homeland with a retinue and journeyed south, subsequently settling amongst the aboriginal Yoruba at some point in the 12th century CE. He is said to have brought the [[Yoruba religion]] with him when he came. This faith system was so important to him and his followers that it is said to have been the cause of their exodus in the first place.
  
The location of Oduduwa's land of origin is a matter of some debate. The popular opinions of a number of the Yoruba claim that he was a prince of [[Mecca]]. It was supposedly the persecution of the [[Muslim]] elite of the city that caused him and his fellow animists to leave [[Arabia]].

Whatever the case may be, it is now considered a historical fact that Oduduwa and his fellow settlers were outsiders from elsewhere that were absorbed by the aborigines of [[Ife]].

===Later years===

Upon the ending of Oduduwa's time on Earth, there was a dispersal of his children and grandchildren from Ife to the outposts that they had previously founded or gained influence over, in order for them to establish effective control over these places. Each is said to have made his or her mark in the subsequent urbanization and consolidation of the Yoruba confederacy of kingdoms, with each child or grandchild fashioning his or her state after [[Ile-Ife]].

Orunto, a child of Oduduwa that was born to his maid, is the ancestor of the families that are entitled to inherit the ''Obalufe'' title - it is held by a royal that's traditionally ranked second in the order of precedence at the Ooni's court.

Obalufon II Alayemore was on the throne when Oranmiyan returned from his sojourn and ordered that the kingship be given to him and hence back to the legitimate family of Oduduwa. Oranmiyan's son Lajamisan was therefore the progenitor of all of the Oonis that have reigned in Ife from his time till now.

== Ife traditions ==

In contradiction of the preceding historical claims, Ife tradition relates that Oduduwa was an emissary from the community of Oke-Ora, the easternmost part of the Ife cultural area which stretches towards the Northeastern [[Ijesa]] people. He descended from the Hills on a chain, earning the [[oriki]] ''Atewonro'' (which means 'one who descends on a chain'). He is said to have been a warrior that wore armor made of iron.
At that time, a confederacy existed between the 13 communities of the valley of Ile-Ife, with each community or 'Elu' having its own Oba; the Oba of Ijugbe, the Oba of Ijio, the Oba of Iwinrin etc.

When Oduduwa rose to be a prominent citizen of ancient Ife, he and his group are believed to have conquered most of the 13 component communities and deposed [[Obatala]],  subsequently evolving the palace structure with its effective centralized power and dynasty. Due to this, he is commonly referred to as the first [[Ooni of Ife]] and progenitor of the legitimate kings of the Benin and the [[Yoruba people]].

===Oduduwa and the line of Olowu===
{{Main|Owu kingdom}}
The first child of Oduduwa, Okanbi Iyunade, married [[Obatala]] and later gave birth to the future crowned king of [[Owu kingdom|Owu]]. He is believed to have acquired his crown as a toddler while crying on his grandfather's lap.

===Oduduwa and the line of Alaketu===
{{Main|Ketu (Benin)}}
Omonide, Oduduwa's favorite wife, gave birth to Sopasan, the father of the future crowned kings of [[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]]. Sopasan was the first to leave Ile-Ife with his mother and crown. He settled at such temporary sites as Oke-Oyan and Aro. At Aro, Soposan died and was succeeded by Owe. The migrants stayed for a number of generations and broke camp in the reign of the seventh king, Ede, who revived the westward migrations and founded a dynasty at Ketu.

===Oduduwa and the line of Òràngún===
{{Main|Orangun}}
Ajagunla Fagbamila Orangun, the first legitimate son of Oduduwa, is crowned king of [[Ila Yara|Ila]].
Oduduwa is said to have wanted more sons to silence his critics. On the advice of the [[Ifa]] oracle, he went to a stream, where he found a naked lady by the name of Adetinrin Anasin. She eventually became his wife and the mother of Ifagbamila (which means "Ifa saves me")

===Oduduwa and the line of Onisabe===
{{Main|Rulers of the Yoruba state of Sabe}}
*Another son is subsequently crowned king of [[Savé|Sabe]].

===Oduduwa and the line of Onipopo===
*A third son is crowned king of Popo.

===Oduduwa and the line of Alaafin===
{{Main|Alaafin}}
[[Oranmiyan]] went on to found Oyo-Ile. His sons [[Ajaka]] and [[Sango]] rule [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] in their turn.

==Oranmiyan==
{{Main|Oranmiyan}}
[[Oranmiyan]] was the last son and the most adventurous of the members of Oduduwa's household. He was the first [[Oba of Benin]], first [[Alaafin]] of Oyo, and the sixth Ooni of Ife.

==Moremi and The Ugbo==

After the dispersal of the family of kings and queens, the aborigines became ungovernable, and constituted themselves into a serious threat to the survival of Ife. Thought to be supporters of [[Obatala]] who had ruled the land before the arrival of Oduduwa, these people turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances, and burn down houses and loot the markets. It is at this point that [[Moremi Ajasoro]], a princess of Offa, of the lineage of Olalomi Olofagangan, the founder of Offa-Ile and the paramount head of the Ibolo region of the old Oyo kingdom, a member of the Ooduan dynasty by marriage to Oranmiyan, is said to have come onto the scene; she subsequently played a significant role in restoring normalcy back to the situation through a spying mission. She allowed herself to be captured and taken away with them. Subsequent to this she got married to the king of the Ugbo. Her new husband wanted pleasures from her but she wouldn't give in because she was married previously and was on a mission. She told him to tell her the secret of the marauders, he didn't want to but after a great deal of prodding, he gave in. He told her that the only thing they fear was ''FIRE'', if they saw fire they would run. After this information she concocted an escape plan. She asked for some oranges and made the juice have a sleeping effect on the palace people. When they woke up after eating them, they found that she had gone to tell her people of their weakness. The people of Ife were soon prepared for the marauders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorubaalliance.org/Newsletter/newsletter74.htm Yoruba Alliance:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702194235/http://www.yorubaalliance.org/Newsletter/newsletter74.htm |date=2011-07-02 }}''Who are the Yoruba!''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative views==

===Oduduwa and his role in creation ===
{{Main|Yoruba religion}}

Native religious traditions about the dawn of time claim that Oduduwa was [[Olodumare]]'s favourite [[Orisa]]. As such, he (or she, as the primordial Oduduwa is gender fluid) was sent from heaven to create the earth upon the waters, a mission he/she had usurped from his/her consort and sibling Obatala, who had been equipped with a snail shell filled with sand and a rooster to scatter the said sand inorder to create land. These beliefs are held by Yoruba traditionalists to be the cornerstone of their story of creation.  Obatala and Oduduwa here are represented symbolically by a [[calabash]], with Obatala taking the top and Oduduwa taking the bottom. In this narrative, Oduduwa is also known as ''Olofin Otete'', the one who took the Basket of Existence from Olodumare.

'''Physical dependence''' is a physical condition caused by chronic use of a [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] forming drug, in which abrupt or gradual [[drug withdrawal]] causes unpleasant physical symptoms.&lt;ref name="Definition of physical dependence - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=454765 |title=Definition of physical dependence - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms |work= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = All about Addiction | work = | publisher = Medical News Today | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/addiction/ | doi = | accessdate = 2015-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical dependence can develop from low-dose therapeutic use of certain medications such as benzodiazepines, opioids, antiepileptics and antidepressants, as well as the [[substance abuse|recreational misuse of drugs]] such as alcohol, opioids, and benzodiazepines. The higher the dose used, the greater the duration of use, and the earlier age use began are predictive of worsened physical dependence and thus more severe withdrawal syndromes. Acute withdrawal syndromes can last days, weeks or months. Protracted withdrawal syndrome, also known as [[post-acute-withdrawal syndrome]] or "PAWS", is a low-grade continuation of some of the symptoms of acute withdrawal, typically in a remitting-relapsing pattern, often resulting in [[relapse]] and prolonged disability of a degree to preclude the possibility of lawful employment. Protracted withdrawal syndrome can last for months, years, or depending on individual factors, indefinitely. Protracted withdrawal syndrome is noted to be most often caused by [[benzodiazepines]].&lt;ref name="pmid1575069"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Landry MJ, Smith DE, McDuff DR, Baughman OL |title=Benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal: identification and medical management |journal=J Am Board Fam Pract |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=167–75 |year=1992 |pmid=1575069 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To dispel the popular misassociation with addiction, physical dependence to medications is sometimes compared to dependence on insulin by persons with diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Withdrawal From Antidepressants: Symptoms, Causes, Treatments|url = http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/withdrawal-from-antidepressants|website = WebMD|access-date = 2016-02-20|language = en-US|quote = These symptoms are not technically the same thing as physical "withdrawal" from a drug.... Unlike drug withdrawal, antidepressant discontinuation effects are not related to addiction but can reflect physiological consequences of stopping a drug, just as when someone with diabetes stops insulin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
Physical dependence can manifest itself in the appearance of both physical and psychological symptoms which are caused by physiological adaptions in the central nervous system and the brain due to chronic exposure to a substance. Symptoms which may be experienced during withdrawal or reduction in dosage include increased heart rate and/or blood pressure, sweating, and tremors. More serious [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms such as [[confusion]], [[seizures]], and [[visual hallucinations]] indicate a serious emergency and the need for immediate medical care. Sedative hypnotic drugs such as [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[benzodiazepines]], and [[barbiturates]] are the only commonly available substances that can be fatal in withdrawal due to their propensity to induce withdrawal convulsions. Abrupt withdrawal from other drugs, such as [[opioid]]s can cause an extremely painful withdrawal that is very rarely fatal in patients of general good health and with medical treatment, but is more often fatal in patients with weakened cardiovascular systems; toxicity is generally caused by the often-extreme increases in heart rate and blood pressure (which can be treated with [[clonidine]]), or due to arrhythmia due to electrolyte imbalance caused by the inability to eat, and constant diarrhea and vomiting (which can be treated with [[loperamide]] and [[ondansetron]] respectively) associated with acute opioid withdrawal, especially in longer-acting substances where the diarrhea and emesis can continue unabated for weeks, although life-threatening complications are extremely rare, and nearly non-existent with proper medical management.

==Treatment==
Treatment for physical dependence depends upon the drug being withdrawn and often includes administration of another drug, especially for substances that can be dangerous when abruptly discontinued or when previous attempts have failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pharmacological Intervention of Nicotine Dependence|journal = BioMed Research International|date = January 2013|issn = 2314-6133|pmc = 3891736|pmid = 24490153|volume = 2013|doi = 10.1155/2013/278392|first = Raka|last = Jain|first2 = Pradipta|last2 = Majumder|first3 = Tina|last3 = Gupta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical dependence is usually managed by a slow dose reduction over a period of weeks, months or sometimes longer depending on the drug, dose and the individual.&lt;ref name="pmid1575069" /&gt; A physical dependence on alcohol is often managed with a cross tolerant drug, such as long acting [[benzodiazepines]] to manage the [[alcohol withdrawal]] symptoms.

Some drugs, like [[anticonvulsants]] and [[antidepressants]], describe the drug category and not the mechanism. The individual agents and drug classes in the anticonvulsant drug category act at many different receptors and it is not possible to generalize their potential for physical dependence or incidence or severity of [[rebound syndrome]] as a group so they must be looked at individually. [[Anticonvulsants]] as a group however are known to cause tolerance to the anti-seizure effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wolfgang Löscher |author2=Dieter Schmidt |title=Experimental and Clinical Evidence for Loss of Effect (Tolerance) during Prolonged Treatment with Antiepileptic Drugs|journal=Epilepsia|volume=47 |issue=8 |pages=1253–1284 |date=August 2006 | doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2006.00607.x |pmid=16922870}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SSRI]] drugs, which have an important use as antidepressants, engender a [[SSRI discontinuation syndrome|discontinuation syndrome]] that manifests with physical side effects. E.g., There have been case reports of a discontinuation syndrome with [[Effexor|venlafaxine]] (Effexor).&lt;ref name="Quaglio G, Schifano F, Lugoboni F 2008 1572–4"/&gt;

[[File:Peinture Palais de Justice de Toulouse.jpg|thumb|''Justice and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime'' by [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]], c. 1805–1808]]

'''Revenge''' is a form of [[justice]] enacted in the absence or defiance of the norms of formal [[law]] and [[jurisprudence]]. Often, revenge is defined as being a harmful action against a person or group in response to a grievance, be it real or perceived. It is used to punish a wrong by going outside the law. [[Francis Bacon]] described revenge as a kind of "wild justice" that "does... offend the law [and] putteth the law out of office."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rjgeib.com/thoughts/revenge/revenge.html|title=Sir Francis Bacon "On Revenge"|work=rjgeib.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitive justice or retributive justice is often differentiated from more formal and refined forms of justice such as [[distributive justice]] and [[divine judgment]].

Social psychologist Ian Mckee states that the desire for the sustenance of power motivates vengeful behavior as a means of impression management: "People who are more vengeful tend to be those who are motivated by power, by authority and by the desire for status. They don't want to [[face (sociological concept)|lose face]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/06/revenge.aspx |title=Revenge and the people who seek it |date= June 2009 |author=Michael Price |volume= 40, No. 6 |page=Print version: page 34 |publisher=apa.org |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian McKee, PhD. 2008. ''Social Justice Research'' (Vol. 138, No. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vengeful behavior has been found across a majority of human societies.&lt;ref&gt;Ericksen, K. P.; Horton, H. (1992). "Blood feuds": Cross-cultural variations in kin group vengeance. ''Behavior Science Research''. 26(1-4): 57-85. doi:[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/106939719202600103 10.1177/106939719202600103].&lt;/ref&gt; Some societies encourage vengeful behavior, which is called a [[feud]]. These societies usually regard the [[honour|honor]] of individuals and groups as of central importance. Thus, while protecting of his reputation an avenger feels as if he restores the previous state of [[dignity]] and [[justice]]. According to [[Michael Ignatieff]], "Revenge is a profound moral desire to keep faith with the dead, to honor their memory by taking up their cause where they left off".&lt;ref&gt;Brandon Hamber and Richard A. Wilson, Symbolic Closure through Memory, Reparation and Revenge in Post-conflict Societies (Johannesburg: Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, honor may become a [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] that passes from [[generation]] to generation. Whenever it is compromised, the affected family or community members might feel compelled to retaliate against an offender to restore the initial "balance of honor" that preceded the perceived injury. This cycle of honor might expand by bringing the family members and then the entire community of the new victim into the brand-new cycle of revenge that may pervade generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.interdisciplinarypress.net/online-store/ebooks/hostility-and-violence/exploring-the-facets-of-revenge |title=Exploring the Facets of Revenge |year=2012 |author=Helena Yakovlev-Golani |chapter=Revenge - the Volcano of Despair: The Story of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{example farm|section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:Notification on 21 October 1941.jpg|thumbnail|German announcement of killing 2300 civilians in [[Kragujevac massacre]] as retaliation for 10 killed German soldiers. Nazi-occupied [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|Serbia]], 1941]]
[[Feud]]s are cycles of provocation and retaliation, fueled by a burning desire for revenge and carried out over long periods of time by familial or tribal groups; they were an important part of many [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]], especially in the Mediterranean region. They still persist in some areas, notably in [[Albania]] with its tradition of ''[[gjakmarrja]]'' or "blood feuds".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2008/0625/p01s02-woeu.html Peacemaker breaks the ancient grip of Albania's blood feuds]". ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' June 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], most would not regard an insult or injury as settled until it was avenged, or, at the least, paid for—hence, the extensive Anglo-Saxon system of [[weregild]] (literally, "man-price") payments, which placed a certain monetary value upon certain acts of violence in an attempt to limit the spiral of revenge by codifying the responsibility of a malefactor.

Blood feuds are still practiced in many parts of the world, including Kurdish regions of [[Turkey]] and in [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/05/05/uk-turkey-attack-feuds-analysis-idUKTRE5443HC20090505 Blood feuds and gun violence plague Turkey's southeast]". Reuters. May 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4181042.stm Deadly twist to PNG's tribal feuds]". BBC News. August 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, honouring one's family, clan, or lord through the practice of revenge killings is called "katakiuchi" (敵討ち).These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. Today, katakiuchi is most often pursued by peaceful means, but revenge remains an important part of Japanese culture.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The motto of the [[Order of the Thistle]] is ''[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]'', Latin for "Nobody shall provoke/injure me with impunity". The origin of the motto reflects the feudal [[Scottish clan|clan]] system of ancient Scotland, particularly the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The goal of some legal systems is limited to "just" revenge—in the fashion of the [[contrapasso]] punishments awaiting those consigned to [[The Divine Comedy|Dante's ''Inferno'']], some have attempted to turn the crime against the criminal, in clever and often gruesome ways.

==Proverbs==
The popular expression "revenge is a dish best served cold" suggests that revenge is more satisfying if enacted when unexpected or long feared, inverting traditional civilized revulsion toward "cold-blooded" violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Jennifer Speake| title=Concise Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs, 5th Ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogm0c8mYtQUC&amp;pg=PT576| accessdate=23 October 2013| year=2008| publisher=Oxford University Press| page=576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea's origin is obscure. The French diplomat [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]] (1754–1838) has been credited with the saying, "La vengeance est un met que l'on doit manger froid" ["Revenge is a dish that must be eaten cold"], albeit without supporting detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Le Dictionnaire Marabout des pensées des auteurs du monde entier |publication-place=Verviers |publisher=Gérard &amp; Co. |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been in the English language at least since the 1846 translation of the 1845 French novel ''Mathilde'' by [[Eugène Sue|Joseph Marie Eugène Sue]]: "''la vengeance se mange très bien froide''",&lt;ref name="EugeneSue1845"&gt;{{cite book | author=Eugène Sue | title=Mathilde: mémoires d'une jeune femme | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SQ6AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA148 | accessdate=26 December 2012 | year=1845 | publisher=Welter | page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there italicized as if quoting a proverbial saying, and translated "revenge is very good eaten cold".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marie Joseph Eugène Sue|title=The orphan; or, Memoirs of Matilda, tr. &amp;#91;from Mathilde&amp;#93; by the hon. D.G. Osborne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMsBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA303|year=1846|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been wrongly credited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/revenge-is-a-dish-best-served-cold.html|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Revenge is a dish best served cold | accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the novel ''[[Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]'' (1782).

Its path to modern popularity may begin with the 1949 film ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' which had ''revenge is a dish which people of taste prefer to eat cold.'' The familiar wording appears in the film ''[[Death Rides a Horse]]'' (1967), in the novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'' by [[Mario Puzo]] (1969), as if from an "old [[Klingon]] proverb" in the film ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' (1982). The title sequence of the [[Quentin Tarantino]] film ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 1]]'' (2003) referred to this last movie by again citing it as a Klingon proverb. After that it appeared in the 2004 version of ''[[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]]''.

The phrase has also been credited to the [[Pashtuns]] of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Fergusson2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fergusson|first=James|title=Taliban: The Unknown Enemy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OlSfhUw9TzEC&amp;pg=PA32|year=2011|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-82034-2|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proverb states, "Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves". Another version ({{zh|子不复仇非子也}}) proposes that a son who does not take revenge for his parents is not a son.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Revenge is a popular subject across many forms of art. Some examples include the painting ''Herodias' Revenge'' by [[Juan de Flandes]] and the opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].  In Japanese art, revenge is a theme in various woodblock prints depicting the [[forty-seven rōnin]] by many well-known and influential artists, including [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]. The Chinese playwright Ji Junxiang used revenge as the central theme in his theatrical work ''[[The Orphan of Zhao]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ref=harv | last=Liu | first=Wu-Chi | title=The Original Orphan of China | journal=Comparative Literature | year=1953 | volume=5 | issue=3 | jstor=1768912 | page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; it depicts more specifically familial revenge, which is placed in the context of [[Confucianism|Confucian morality]] and social hierarchical structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | ref=harv | last=Shi  |first=Fei | title=Text &amp; presentation, 2008 | year=2009 | publisher=McFarland | location=Jefferson | isbn=9780786443666 | editor=Constantinidis, Stratos E. | chapter=Tragic Ways of Killing a Child: Staging Violence and Revenge in Classical Greek and Chinese Drama | page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature ==
{{essay|section|date=September 2017}}
Revenge has been a popular literary theme historically and continues to play a role in modern and contemporary works today. Notable examples of literature that feature revenge as a theme include the plays ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]], the novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas]], and the short story "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].  More modern examples include the novels ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'' by [[Stephen King]] and ''[[Gone Girl (novel)|Gone Girl]]'' by [[Gillian Flynn]]. Other examples are the Greek myths of [[Medea]], and the novel ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' by [[William Goldman]]. Although revenge is a theme in itself, it is also considered to be a genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women and Revenge in Shakespeare: Gender, Genre, and Ethics|last = Marguerite|first = Tassi|date = September 22, 2012|journal = Renaissance Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenge as a genre has been consistent with a variety of themes that have frequently appeared in different texts over the last few centuries. Such themes at hand include but are not limited to: [[disguise]], [[Masking (personality)|masking]], sex, [[cannibalism]], the [[grotesque body|grotesque]], bodily fluids, power, violent murders, and secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Revenge: An Analysis of Its Psychological Underpinnings|last = Grobbink|first = Leonie|date = July 2015|journal = International Journal of Offender Therapy &amp; Comparative Criminology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each theme, along with the concept of [[Irony#Dramatic irony|dramatic irony]], play a large role in the success of revenge in literature. Dramatic irony is a literary device in which the audience possesses knowledge unavailable to characters in a novel, play, or film.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=f8163f8d-cf94-4bab-9b2b-db78100c535c%40sessionmgr4004&amp;vid=15&amp;hid=4213&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3d#AN=89404922&amp;db=ers|title = Dramatic Irony|date = January 2015|website = Research Starters|publisher = Salem Press Encyclopedia of Literature|last = Rholetter|first = Wylene}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to intensify the tragic events that are going to unfold by creating tension between the audience and the actions of the characters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is essential to narratives of revenge.

The most common theme within the genre of revenge is the recurring violent murders that take place throughout the text, more so, however, in the final act or scene. The root of the violence is usually derived from the characters' childhood development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nonviolenceandsocialjustice.org/Research-Literature/Sanctuary-Model-literature-and-works-by-Sandra-Bloom/Reflections-on-the-Desire-for-Revenge/75/|title = Reflections on the Desire for Revenge|date = 2001|website = Center for Nonviolence and Social Justice|last = Bloom|first = Sandra|publisher = Journal of Emotional Abuse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violent murders are seen in many texts ranging from dramas to novels. ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', a 20th-century novel written by [[Stephen King]], has prime examples of this theme that do, indeed, occur during the final scenes. Another interesting text that incorporates this theme is the sixteenth-century drama ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]].

Continuing on, the themes of masking and disguise have the ability to go hand in hand with one another. A character may employ disguise literally or [[metaphor]]ically. A mask, per se, is the literal example of this theme; while pretending to be something one is not is considered to be the metaphoric example. Additional themes that may cause the [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]] to develop a masked or disguised identity include sex, power, and even [[cannibalism]]. Examples of sex and power being used as themes can be seen in the novel ''[[Gone Girl (novel)|Gone Girl]]'', by [[Gillian Flynn]], as well as the already mentioned drama, ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''.

Overall, although revenge is considered a theme in itself, its constant development over the last few centuries can allow it to be considered a genre as well. Key components, expressed as themes, that make up this genre are prevalent in copious literary works.

Humans are not the only species known to take revenge. There are several species such as [[camel]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[fish]], [[lions]],&lt;ref&gt;Mills, M. G. L. (1991).

[[Primatology|Primatologists]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Frans de Waal]] and Lesleigh Luttrellave conducted numerous studies that provide evidence of revenge in many species of primates. They observed chimpanzees and noticed patterns of revenge. For example, if chimpanzee A helped chimpanzee B defeat his opponent, chimpanzee C, then chimpanzee C would be more likely to help chimpanzee A's opponent in a later squabble. Chimpanzees are one of the most common species that show revenge due to their desire for dominance. Studies have also been performed on less cognitive species such as fish to demonstrate that not only intellectual animals execute revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Beyond Revenge : The Evolution of the Forgiveness Instinct|last = McCullough|first = Michael|publisher = Jossey-Bass|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = 79–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Romani people]]''' ({{lang-bg|цигани {{IPA-bg|tsiɡɐni|}}, роми {{IPA-bg|rɔmi|}}}}) '''in [[Bulgaria]]''' constitute Europe's densest Romani minority. The Romani people in Bulgaria "speak Bulgarian, Turkish or Romani, depending on the region and their religious affiliations."

According to the latest census in 2011, the number of the Romani is 325,343, constituting 4.4% of the total population, in which only one ethnic group could be opted as an answer and 10% of the total population did not respond to the question on ethnic group. In a conclusive report of the census sent to [[Eurostat]], the authors of the census (the [[National Statistical Institute (Bulgaria)|National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria]]) identified the census results on ethnicity as a "gross manipulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Критичен доклад относно Преброяването на населението и жилищния фонд, проведено към 1 февруари 2011 година |url=http://www.nsi.bg/bg/content/12037/basic-page/%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4-%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%8F%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE-%D0%B8-%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%89%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former head of the [[National Statistical Institute (Bulgaria)|National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria]], [[Reneta Indzhova]] claims to have been fired by the Bulgarian Prime Minister in 2014 for attempting to check the actual number of the Romani and implied that neither the census did enumerate the Romani, nor its statistics did provide the "real data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Бивш премиер без пенсия.

== Overview ==
In Bulgaria, Romani are most commonly referred to as ''[[Tsigani]]'' (цигани, pronounced {{IPA-bg|tsiɡəni|}}), an [[exonym]] that some Romani resent and others embrace. The form of the [[endonym]] ''Roma'' in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] is ''romi'' (роми). They are generally younger, according to the 2011 census they make up 10.2% of the population aged up to 9 years, on a note 14.9% of the total age group being non-respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://censusresults.nsi.bg/Census/Reports/2/2/R7.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68OJXNJMI?url=http://censusresults.nsi.bg/Census/Reports/2/2/R7.aspx |archivedate=13 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/bg/content/3078/население-по-области-общини-населени-места-и-възраст-към-01022011-г|title=Population by districts, municipalities, settlements and age as of 01.02.2011|website=Nsi.bg|accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bulgaria Roma are discriminated: 59% to 80% of non-Roma have negative feelings towards Roma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lw-Byail0EkC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=ethnic+bulgarians+percent#v=onepage&amp;q=ethnic%20bulgarians%20percent&amp;f=false |title=Romani Routes: Cultural Politics and Balkan Music in Diaspora |author=Carol Silverman |page=12 |date=2012-05-24 |accessdate=2016-05-21|isbn=9780195300949 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They are emancipated social group, having higher crime, unemployment, birth, death and poverty rates, and not many of them attend school. Though most live in poverty, the Romani are represented in [[Bulgarian mafia]] and rich Romani crime bosses deal with drug trade and prostitution. Though most of them are officially unemployed, they have a high rate of child sex workers. Roma constitute the majority of prison population according to self-identification of inmates, with 7000 prisoners (70%) out of 10,000 in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.24chasa.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=4583604 |title=Само 10 000 в затвора, 7000 от тях са цигани |website=24chasa.bg |date= |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2002 data, the poverty rate among Romani is 61.8%, in contrast to a rate of 5.6% among Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HP7eBMn6aGUC&amp;pg=PT253&amp;dq=bulgarians+turks+poverty+rate#v=onepage&amp;q=bulgarians%20turks%20poverty%20rate&amp;f=false |title=World Economic and Social Survey 2003: Trends and Policies in the World Economy - United Nations |accessdate=2016-05-21|isbn=9789211091434 |last1=Nations |first1=United |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, 84% of Bulgarian Romani lived under the poverty line, compared with 32% of ethnic Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;The Roma in Central and Eastern Europe: Avoiding the Dependency Trap, pp. 31, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the poverty rate of Romani was estimated at 71.4%, compared with 15% for Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=O_tXHTK2kQUC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=ethnic+bulgarians+constitute#v=onepage&amp;q=ethnic%20bulgarians%20constitute&amp;f=false |title=Poverty, Ethnicity, and Gender in Eastern Europe During the Market Transition |author1=Rebecca Jean Emigh |author2=Iván Szelényi |page=47 |accessdate=2016-05-21|isbn=9780275968816 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[unemployment]] rate of non-Romani in Bulgaria was 25%, while of the Romani it was 65% in 2008, for instance in neighbouring Romania and Hungary the Romani had much lower unemployment rates - 14% and 21% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Revenga |first1=Ana |last2=Ringold |first2=Dena |last3=Tracy |first3=William Martín |title=Poverty and Ethnicity: A Cross-country Study of Roma Poverty in Central Europe |date=2002 |publisher=World Bank Publications |isbn=9780821353394 |url=https://books.google.bg/books?id=3T4zvJ-KUaMC&amp;pg=PA29 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Silverman |first1=Carol |title=Romani Routes: Cultural Politics and Balkan Music in Diaspora |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199913350 |url=https://books.google.bg/books?id=LrPEBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT50 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 only 23% of the Romani in Bulgaria are employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EU agency study: Situation of Bulgarian Roma is appalling |url=https://sofiaglobe.com/2016/11/29/e-u-agency-study-results-the-situation-of-bulgarian-roma-is-appalling/ |website=The Sofia Globe |date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unemployed enjoy more financial aid than other citizens, especially for children, which may have prompt the higher birth rates of the Romani.

The Turks are more negative towards the Romani than the Bulgarians, with 30-50% rejecting various interactions and friendship with Romani. Although only 25% of Romani parents object to their children to be married with a Bulgarian and a Turk, only 4% of the Bulgarians and 6% of the Turks would marry a Romani person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallup|url=http://www.gallup-international.bg/bg/%D0%9F%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8/2015/227-Hypotheses-on-Attitudes-Towards-the-Roma}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Две трети от българите приемат етническото разделение за нормално   - Mediapool.bg|url=http://www.mediapool.bg/dve-treti-ot-balgarite-priemat-etnicheskoto-razdelenie-za-normalno-news134799.html|website=Mediapool.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romani are avoided by the majority traditionally, especially for marriage, however, there are ethnically mixed people with Gypsy and Bulgarian parents who are called жоревци "''zhorevtsi''" (from the common name [[George (given name)|George]]).

==History==

The Romani people originate from [[North India|Northern]] [[India]],{{sfn|Hancock|2002 |p= [https://books.google.com/?id=MG0ahVw-kdwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR20  xx] | ps =: ‘While a nine century removal from India has diluted Indian biological connection to the extent that for some Romanian groups, it may be hardly representative today, Sarren (1976:72) concluded that we still remain together, genetically, Asian rather than European’}}&lt;ref name="IsabelMendizabal"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212012602|first=Isabel|last=Mendizabal|title=Reconstructing the Population History of European Romani from Genome-wide Data|journal=Current Biology|date=6 December 2012|accessdate=12 December 2012|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2012.10.039|volume=22|issue=24|pages=2342–2349|pmid=23219723}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Comas"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sindya N.

The linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that roots of Romani language lie in India: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indian languages and shares with them a big part of the basic lexicon, for example, body parts or daily routines.&lt;ref name="mluvnice"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Šebková | first1 = Hana | last2 = Žlnayová | first2 = Edita | year = 1998 | url = http://rss.archives.ceu.hu/archive/00001112/01/118.pdf | title = Nástin mluvnice slovenské romštiny (pro pedagogické účely) | place = Ústí nad Labem | publisher = Pedagogická fakulta Univerzity J.

More exactly, Romani shares the basic lexicon with [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. It shares many phonetic features with [[Marwari (language)|Marwari]], while its grammar is closest to [[Bengali language|Bengali]].&lt;ref name="hub1995"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Milena|last=Hübschmannová|title=Romaňi čhib – romština: Několik základních informací o romském jazyku|journal=Bulletin Muzea Romské Kultury|issue=4/1995|year= 1995 |place=Brno|quote=Zatímco romská lexika je bližší hindštině, marvárštině, pandžábštině atd., v gramatické sféře nacházíme mnoho shod s východoindickým jazykem, s bengálštinou.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic findings in 2012 suggest the Romani originated in northwestern India and migrated as a group.&lt;ref name="IsabelMendizabal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.livescience.com/40652-facts-about-roma-romani-gypsies.html|title=5 Intriguing Facts About the Roma|work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a genetic study in 2012, the ancestors of present [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes]] populations of [[North India|northern]] [[India]], traditionally referred to collectively as the [[Ḍoma]], are the likely ancestral populations of the modern European Roma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Rai | first1 = N | last2 = Chaubey | first2 = G | last3 = Tamang | first3 = R | last4 = Pathak | first4 = AK | last5 = Singh | first5 = VK | year = 2012 | title = The Phylogeography of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup H1a1a-M82 Reveals the Likely Indian Origin of the European Romani Populations | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | number = 11 | page = e48477 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0048477 | pmid=23209554 | pmc=3509117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, during the International Roma Conference, the [[Minister of External Affairs (India)|Indian Minister of External Affairs]] stated that the people of the Roma community were children of India. The conference ended with a recommendation to the [[Government of India]] to recognize the Roma community spread across 30 countries as a part of the [[Indian diaspora]].&lt;ref name="diaspora"/&gt;

===Migration to Bulgaria===

It is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]] (or [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]) language — like [[Sanskrit]], [[Hindi]], and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] — which belongs to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] branch of the Indo-European family. The language retains much of the Indic morphology, phonology and lexicon, while its syntax has been heavily influenced by contact with other languages.

Bulgarian ethnologists Elena Marushiakova and Veselin Popov assert that no direct evidence indicates when precisely the Romani first appeared in Bulgaria. While they mention that other Bulgarian and international scholars have associated the 1387 [[Medieval Bulgarian royal charters|Charter of Rila]] term ''Agoupovi Kleti'' with the Romani, they hold that the term refers to seasonal lodgings for mountain herdsmen. Instead, they delimit the mass settlement of Romani in Bulgarian territory between the 13th and 14th centuries, supporting this time frame with 13th- and 14th-century documents referring to Romani presence in the surrounding Balkan states.&lt;ref&gt;Marushiakova et al., ''Gypsies in the Ottoman Empire: a contribution to the history of the Balkans'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bulgarian sociologist Ilona Tomova, Ottoman fiscal reports between the 15th and 17th centuries indirectly indicate Romani settlement in Bulgaria since the 13th century, as most registered Romani possessed [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]] names and were Christians.&lt;ref name="tomova"&gt;Tomova, ''Ethnic Dimensions of poverty in Bulgaria'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although the largest Roma migration wave to the Bulgarian lands seems to have occurred in the 13th and 14th centuries, many Roma arrived with the Ottoman troops, accompanying army craftsmen and complementary military units."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, during the 14th and 15th centuries, Muslim Romani arrived in Bulgaria with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, serving as auxiliaries, craftsmen, musicians and other professions.&lt;ref name="tomova"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marushiakova et al., ''Gypsies in the Ottoman Empire: a contribution to the history of the Balkans'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Ottoman Empire’s other subjects in the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]] system, Romani were governed based on their ethnicity, not their religious affiliation.&lt;ref name="celik5"&gt;Celik, ''Exploring Marginality in the Ottoman Empire: Gypsies or People of Malice (Ehl-i Fesad) as Viewed by the Ottomans Authors'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman tax records first mention Romani in the [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]] region, where 3.5% of the registered households were Romani. Under [[Mehmed II]]’s reign, all Romani — Christian and Muslim — paid a poll-tax that was otherwise imposed only on non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Marushiakova et al., ''Gypsies in the Ottoman Empire: a contribution to the history of the Balkans'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th century, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] enacted laws to prohibit the mingling of Muslim and Christian Romani and to administer taxes collected from the Romani: the 1530 ''Gypsies in the [[Rumelia]] Region Act'' and a 1541 law for the Romani [[sanjak|sancak]].&lt;ref name="tomova"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marushiakova et al.

Roma in Bulgaria are not a unified community in culture and lifestyle. The most widespread group of the Romani in the country are the ''yerlii'' or the 'local Roma', who are in turn divided into Bulgarian Gypsies (''daskane roma'') and Turkish Gypsies (''horahane roma'').

Other Romani groups include the conservative wandering ''[[Kalderash]]'' (sometimes referred to by the exonym ''Serbian Gypsies'') that are Eastern Orthodox and the ''[[Rudari]]'' (or ''Ludari'') who speak a dialect of [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and are known as ''Vlax Gypsies''. They are further subdivided into three groups by their traditional craft: the ''[[Ursari]]'' or ''Mechkari'' ('bear trainers'), the ''Lingurari'' or ''Kopanari'' ('carpenters', primarily associated with wooden bowls) and the ''[[Lăutari|Lautari]]'' ('musicians'). They migrated from [[Wallachia]] to present-day Bulgaria after 1856, the year of their liberation from [[Slavery in Romania|slavery]].

According to the 2011 census of the population of Bulgaria, there are 325,343 Gypsies in Bulgaria,&lt;ref name=Census2011final/&gt; or 4.4 percent. 180,266 of these are urban residents and 145,077 rural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://censusresults.nsi.bg/Census/Reports/1/2/R7.aspx |format=PDF |title=Census Results 2011 |website=Censusresults.nsi.bg |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA Factbook claimed that 10% of the population is from unknown ethnic group, citing the 2011 census of the population of Bulgaria.
In 1992 of 5202 settlements there were registered Romani in 2095.

22% of the Romani live in northeast, whereas settlements with prevailing Romani are located mostly in northeastern Bulgaria - mostly in [[Dobruja]]. According to the 1910 census, although in Bulgarian [[Dobruja]] there were settlements mostly populated even by [[Germans]] and [[Russians]], there wasn't a single settlement with Romani plurality there and also on the 1930 Romanian census of the same region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historymaps.ro/?tag=harta-etnica-cadrilater|title=harta etnica cadrilater – History Maps|website=Historymaps.ro|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most of the Roma, 66%, are young children and adults up to 29 years old, the same group constitutes 37% among ethnic Bulgarians, while 5% of Roma are 60 years and over, Bulgarians are 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WRL1yhvtYVwC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=ethnic+bulgarians+constitute#v=onepage&amp;q=ethnic%20bulgarians%20constitute&amp;f=false |title=Democratisation and the Prevention of Violent Conflict: Lessons Learned from ... |author=Jenny Engström |page=77 |accessdate=2016-05-21|isbn=9780754674344 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1992 census to the 2001 census, the number of Romani in the country has increased by 57,512, or 18.4%. The Romani were only 2.8% in 1910 and 2.0% in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://balkans21.org/2002_1/euro1.html#7| title = Assoc.

While the Romani are present in all [[provinces of Bulgaria]], their highest percentages are in [[Montana Province]] (12.5%) and [[Sliven Province]] (12.3%) and their smallest percentage is in [[Smolyan Province]], where they number 686&lt;ref name="Ethnos"&gt;{{cite web

[[Varbitsa (town)|Varbitsa]] is possibly the only urban settlement where the Romani are the most numerous group. The largest Romani quarters are [[Stolipinovo]] in [[Plovdiv]] and [[Fakulteta]] in [[Sofia]]. The number of places where Romani constitute more than 50% of the population has doubled from the 1992 to the 2001 census.

==Problems of exclusion and discrimination==
In a [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]/[[International Labour Organization|ILO]] survey, Bulgarian Romani identified unemployment, economic hardship and discrimination in access to employment as major problems.

The Council of Europe body ECRI stated in its June 2003 third report on Bulgaria that Romani encounter "serious difficulties in many spheres of life", elaborating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The main problems stem from the fact that the Roma districts are turning into ghettos. [...] Most Roma neighbourhoods consist of slums, precariously built without planning permission on land that often belongs to the municipalities [...]. As the Bulgarian authorities have not taken steps to address the situation, the people living in these districts have no access to basic public services, whether health care, public transport, waste collection or sanitation."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web
| year = 2003
| url = http://hudoc.ecri.coe.int/XMLEcri/ENGLISH/Cycle_03/03_CbC_eng/BGR-CbC-III-2004-2-ENG.pdf
| title = Third report on Bulgaria
| publisher = Council of Europe - ECRI
| accessdate = 2009-02-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To which the Bulgarian government answered officially in the same document:

&lt;blockquote&gt;ECRI has correctly observed that members of the Roma community encounter “serious difficulties” “in many spheres of life”. The rest of this paragraph, however, regrettably contains sweeping, grossly inaccurate generalizations ... Due to various objective and subjective factors, many (but by no means all!) members of the Roma community found it particularly difficult to adapt to the new realities of the market economy. “…Romani mahala-dwellers are still captives of the past, holding onto and behaving according to preconceptions about the socialist welfare state that clash with the modern realities of a market economy and privatisation.” (Skopje Report, p.6)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.per-usa.org/reports/Roma-Skopje.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710184636/http://www.per-usa.org/reports/Roma-Skopje.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More concretely, the allegation that the people living in these districts “have no access to basic public services” is largely inaccurate. Certain difficulties (though not remotely on the scale suggested) do exist in this regard, and the authorities are taking concrete measures to address them (see above). However, as the Advisor on Roma and Sinti issues at the OSCE, N. Gheorghe remarked during the Skopje meeting: “…many of the Roma confuse public services with rights to which they are entitled and which are guaranteed by the welfare state” (Skopje Report, p.16). ...

Concerning the issue of the electricity supply it should be noted that dwellers of such neighbourhoods sometimes refuse to pay their electricity bills. This attitude could at least in part be explained by the fact that “…Romani mahala-dwellers believe they have rights as citizens to electricity and other services, and that the state has an obligation to provide and to a large extent to subsidize them” (Skopje Report, p. 7). In these circumstances electricity suppliers may find themselves with no other option but to “sometimes cut off” the electricity supply in order to incite the consumers to commence honouring their debts. Such cut-offs are part of standard practice and the ethnic origin of the consumers is irrelevant in these cases.

With respect to welfare benefits, which allegedly “in some cases, moreover, Roma do not receive” while “they are entitled” to them, it should be underscored that Bulgaria’s social welfare legislation sets uniform objective criteria for access to welfare benefits for all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic origin (furthermore, any discrimination, including on ethnic grounds is expressly prohibited by law). The question of who is entitled or not entitled to welfare benefits is determined by the relevant services on the basis of a means test. Every single decision of these services must be (and is) in written form and clearly motivated. If a claimant is not satisfied with a decision, he/she is entitled to appeal it before the regional welfare office. Consequently, this allegation of ECRI is also erroneous."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A monitoring report by the [[Open Society Institute]] found that Romani children and teenagers are less likely to enroll in primary and secondary schools than the majority population and less likely to complete their education if they do. Between 60% and 77% of Romani children enroll in primary education (ages 6–15), compared to 90-94% of ethnic Bulgarians. Only 6%-12% of Romani teenagers enroll in secondary education (ages 16–19). The drop-out rate is significant, but hard to measure, as many are formally enrolled but rarely attend classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2007 |url=http://www.eumap.org/topics/minority/reports/roma_education/reports/national/bulgaria/romeduc_bulgaria.pdf |title=Equal access to quality education for Roma, Bulgaria |pages=32–34 |publisher=Open Society Institute - EU Monitoring and Advocacy Program (EUMAP) |accessdate=2007-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227083217/http://www.eumap.org/topics/minority/reports/roma_education/reports/national/bulgaria/romeduc_bulgaria.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also indicates that Romani children and teenagers attend de facto segregated "Roma schools" in majority-Romani neighbourhoods and villages. These "Roma schools" offer inferior quality education; many are in bad physical condition and lack necessary facilities such as computers. As a result, Romani literacy rates, already below those for ethnic Bulgarians, are much lower still for Romani who have attended segregated schools.&lt;ref&gt;Equal access to quality education for Roma, Bulgaria, pp. 18-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The official position of the Bulgarian government to such segregation is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There had never been a policy of "segregation" of Roma children in the national education system. The fact that in some neighbourhoods in certain towns particular schools were attended predominantly by pupils of Roma origin was an [[unintended consequence]] of the administrative division of the school system. According to the rules valid for all children irrespective of their ethnic origin, admittance to any public school was linked administratively to the domicile of the family. In neighbourhoods where the population was predominantly of Roma origin, this system produced schools, attended predominantly by pupils of Roma origin. It is precisely this situation that the authorities are taking special measures to rectify. Therefore, the word “segregation" with respect to Roma children is inaccurate."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Romani children are often sent to special schools for children with intellectual disabilities or boarding schools for children with "deviant behavior" (so-called "delinquent schools"). According to reports of the [[Bulgarian Helsinki Committee]] (BHC), Romani made up half the number of students in schools for children with intellectual disabilities and about two-thirds of the students of the boarding schools, where the BHC found a variety of human rights abuses, including physical violence. In both sets of special schools, the quality of teaching is very poor and essential things such as desks, textbooks and teaching materials are inadequate or altogether lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bulgarian Helsinki Committee | title = Помощните училища в България (Remedial Schools in Bulgaria) | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-954-9738-14-8 }}{{cite book | last = Bulgarian Helsinki Committee | title = Социално-педагогически и възпитателни училища-интернати (Social-Pedagogical Boarding Schools and Correctional Boarding Schools) | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-954-9738-03-2 | pages = 391–392 }}{{cite book | last = Bulgarian Helsinki Committee | title = В името на институцията: поправителните училища в България (In the Name of the Institution: Schools for Delinquent Children in Bulgaria) | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-954-9738-21-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On two occasions, the European Committee of Social Rights has found violations of the [[European Social Charter]] in situations with Bulgaria's Romani population: in 2006, concerning right to housing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/socialcharter/Complaints/CC31Merits_en.pdf |title=La Charte sociale européenne |website=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008, concerning right to health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/socialcharter/Complaints/CC46Merits_en.pdf |title=La Charte sociale européenne |website=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; — in both cases on complaints from the [[European Roma Rights Centre]].

===Political representation===
According to a report of POLITEA, "For the most of the 1990s the only representation the Romani got was through the mainstream political parties. This was a very limited form of representation in which one or two Romani had a symbolic presence in Parliament during each term." The Bulgarian Constitution does not allow political parties based on ethnic, religious, or racist principles or ideology. However, "Twenty one Roma political organizations were founded between 1997 and 2003 in Bulgaria [...]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web

In the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2005|2005 Bulgarian parliamentary election]], three Romani parties took part: [[Euroroma]], [[Movement for an Equal Public Model]] (as part of a coalition led by the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]]) and the Civil Union "Roma" (as part of a coalition led by the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2005izbori.org/results/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510063201/http://www.2005izbori.org/results/index.html |archivedate=10 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he never won a major pool tournament as "Fats", he was perhaps the most publicly recognized pool player in the United States&amp;nbsp;— not only as a player, but also as an entertainer.&lt;ref name="Dyer 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Fats Family Breakthrough|last=Dyer|first=R.

Wanderone began playing at a young age in New York City. As a teenager, he became a traveling [[Hustling|pool hustler]]. Later, in his 30s, he moved to southern [[Illinois]] where he met and married his first wife, Evelyn. During World War II, he hustled servicemen in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. With the end of the war, Wanderone returned to Illinois and entered semi-retirement.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Wanderone adopted the nickname "[[Minnesota Fats]]" from a character in the 1961 film ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]'', claiming that the character was based upon him. He parlayed the association with the film into his own book deals and television appearances, including a series of matches with rival [[Willie Mosconi]]. Later in life, Wanderone divorced Evelyn and moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he married his second wife, Theresa, with whom he remained until his death.

==Early life and career==
Wanderon was born in New York City to Rosa and Rudolf Wanderon, [[Switzerland|Swiss]] immigrants.&lt;ref name="Census 1920"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in 1913, but sometimes hinted he was born earlier, even as early as 1900.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Robert McG.|authorlink=Robert McG.

[[File:Erich Hagenlocher 01.jpg|thumb|Wanderone's first billiards teacher, the German champion Erich Hagenlocher]]

Known as "Rudy" to friends and family,&lt;ref name="Dyer 2008"/&gt; Wanderone started playing pool as a child while living in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan]]. In 1923, he traveled to Europe with his father where he received training from German [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline billiards]] champion Erich Hagenlocher. His first prominent match was in 1926 when he competed against former [[nine-ball]] champion "Cowboy" Weston; Wanderone won, handily.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Wanderone left school in the eighth grade&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; and became a traveling pool hustler, spending  much of the 1920s playing at a pool hall called Cranfield's in New York City, where he received his first nickname after beating another hustler known as "Smart Henry". The intensity of their competition led Wanderone's friend, [[Titanic Thompson]], to dub Wanderone "Double-Smart".&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1930s, during the [[Great Depression]], Wanderone had become a manager of a pool hall, owned by a friend, in [[Anacostia]], southeast Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Dyer 2003, p. 35"&gt;Dyer (2003), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; He had acquired more notoriety and nicknames, including "Triple-Smart Fats", "New York Fats", "Broadway Fats", and "Chicago Fats",&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), pp. 13, 122–23&lt;/ref&gt; attracting {{Cuegloss|Action|action}} from other hustlers, including the then-unknown [[Luther Lassiter|Luther "Wimpy" Lassiter]].&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), pp. 34–37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Wanderone and friend Jimmy Castras &lt;!--This is NOT a typo for player [[Jimmy Caras]].--&gt; arrived in [[southern Illinois]]&amp;nbsp;— a major hustling center on a fast track to televised tournament play&amp;nbsp;— and settled in [[Du Quoin, Illinois]], where he continued hustling.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he met Evelyn Inez Graff; they married two months to the day later, on May 7, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BankShot"/&gt; Following their wedding, the Wanderones settled in [[Dowell, Illinois]]. In 1942, the couple moved to [[Norfolk, Virginia]].  Norfolk had become a key mustering point for [[United States Armed Forces|American soldiers]], as well as a shipbuilding center. The growing population led to an enormous interest in gambling; Wanderone, in partnership with fellow hustler Lassiter, quickly recognized the financial possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Following World War II, however, the action "dried up" soon, and the Wanderones returned to [[Southern Illinois|Little Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; For a period throughout the 1950s, Wanderone entered semi-retirement, making only occasional hustling trips to New York City.

=="Minnesota Fats"==
In 1961, the film version of [[Walter Tevis]]' novel ''[[The Hustler (novel)|The Hustler]]'' was released. [[The Hustler (film)|The film]] tells the story of a pool shark named "Fast Eddie" Felson and his quest to beat the greatest pool player in America, "Minnesota Fats". World Champion [[Willie Mosconi]] served as a technical advisor and [[trick shot]] [[Stunt performer|stunt man]] for the film. Wanderone almost immediately dropped his "New York Fats" nickname, adopted the name "Minnesota Fats" and began spreading the story that the character was based on him. Tevis denied this for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), pp. 122–28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wanderone The Player poster.jpg|thumb|right|Promotional poster for ''The Player'' (1971) starring Wanderone as "Fats".]]
Wanderone's notoriety as "Minnesota Fats" led to a job as [[Senior management|executive vice-president]] of [[billiard table]] manufacturer Rozel Industries, playing [[Exhibition game|exhibition matches]] and giving demonstrations. Rozel, in 1965, published Wanderone's first book: ''Minnesota "Fats" Book of Billiards''. On January 17, 1965, he appeared on the television [[game show]] ''[[What's My Line?]]'', successfully stumping the panel.&lt;ref name="MyLine"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's My Line? episode #747|publisher=TV.com|url=http://www.tv.com/whats-my-line/episode-747/episode/97963/summary.html?tag=ep_list;ep_title;763|access-date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, he wrote his autobiography, ''The Bank Shot, and Other Great Robberies'', with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' [[Sports journalism|journalist]] Tom Fox.&lt;ref name="BankShot"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bank Shot and Other Great Robberies: The Uncrowned Champion of Pocket Billiards Describes His Game and How It's Played|author="Minnesota Fats"|last2=Fox|first2=Tom|editor1-last=Dyer|editor1-first=R.A.|edition= rev.|publisher=Lyons|location=[[Guilford, Connecticut]] | year=2006|origyear=1966|isbn=1-59228-701-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first television game show, ''Minnesota Fats Hustles the Pros'', debuted in 1967, featuring "Fats" playing against other pro players.&lt;ref name="Broadcasting"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Broadcasting|volume=72|title=1967, May–June|year=1993|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|location=[[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]|page= 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 he completed and published an instructional paperback, ''Minnesota Fats on Pool'', which was reprinted through 1976 in large-quantity editions, then reissued as a hardcover in 1993, and remains to this day commonly available.&lt;ref name="OnPool"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Minnesota Fats on Pool: The Complete Book for the Pool Enthusiast Including the How to of Shotmaking and All Game Rules|last="Fats|first=Minnesota"|publisher=Billiard Library Co.|year=1967|isbn=99903-959-5-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, on January 24, 1968, Wanderone was a guest on ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (talk show)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''.&lt;ref name="IMDb0910794"&gt;{{IMDb name|0910794|Rudolf Wanderone Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1970, ''Celebrity Billiards with Minnesota Fats'', another short-lived television game show series, featured Wanderone playing against celebrity guests such as [[Sid Caesar]].&lt;ref name="BCA"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dyer|first=R.A.|author2=Billiards Congress of America Rules Committee|year=2005|title=Billiards: The Official Rules and Records Book|page=154|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=1-59228-744-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDb0198078"&gt;{{IMDb title|0198078|Celebrity Billiards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a feature film ''The Player'' (produced in December 1970, in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]), Wanderone played himself as "Minnesota Fats" and was featured prominently on the promotional poster.&lt;ref name="Time 1970"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Profile|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=December 28, 1970|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944258,00.html|access-date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poster"&gt;''The Player'' promotional poster (1971). USA: International Cinema. ''See illustration in article.''&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay was written and directed by Thomas DeMartini, also starred pool pro Jack Colavita, and had a limited release in 1971 by International Cinema.&lt;ref name="Mitchell 2006"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Darren|url=http://www.billiardboys.com/moviegallery/billiardmovies.html|title=Profile at|work=BilliardBoys.com|publisher=Billiard Boys LLC|location=Seattle, Washington|access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year Wanderone was a guest on both ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' (September 21, 1971), on which he hustled Carson out of [[United States dollar|US$]]1,&lt;ref name="TrueAnimal"/&gt; and the British ''[[David Frost|David Frost Show]]'' (October 13, 1971).&lt;ref name="IMDb0910794"/&gt; His fame as "Fats" had already made it difficult for Wanderone to hustle effectively, so he relied more and more on exhibition games for income.&lt;ref name="Time 1970"/&gt;

By 1979, Wanderone was well-known enough to be playing himself as a celebrity guest star on a Season 2 episode of the popular television detective drama ''[[Vega$]]'', titled "the Usurper",&lt;ref name="IMDb0910794"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDb0739244"&gt;{{IMDb episode|0739244|''Vega$'': "The Usurper" (1979)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the episode featured "Fats" and pro [[Jimmy Mataya]] playing one another in a game of pool. In 1980, while visiting a one-mile stretch of St. Louis, Wanderone had to double his order of autographed pictures after he was stopped thirty-seven times.  During this trip he was beaten by Michael Boulton 4 out of 10 times in games of pool.&lt;ref name="NBN 1980-03"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Photocaption|journal=National Billiard News|page= 22|date=March 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalry with Willie Mosconi==
Wanderone enjoyed promoting a feud with world champion Mosconi over how to present pool&amp;nbsp;— either as a rough-and-tumble gambling game (Wanderone) or as a genteel pastime and art form (Mosconi).&lt;ref name="Dyer 2007"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hustler &amp; The Champ: Willie Mosconi, Minnesota Fats, and the Rivalry that Defined Pool|last=Dyer|first=R. A.|publisher=Lyons|year=2007|isbn=1-59228-883-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosconi's widow, Flora, said of the rivalry, "My husband hated Minnesota Fats because he felt that &lt;nowiki&gt;[Wanderone]&lt;/nowiki&gt; was always hurting the image of the game instead of helping it."&lt;ref name="NYT 1993"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFD9163BF93BA2575AC0A965958260|title=Willie Mosconi, 80, Who Ruled the World of Billiards with Style|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 18, 1993|access-date=May 12, 2016|edition= "Obituaries" section}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanderone would state smugly, "I may have 'given away' a few games to deserving competitors, but I have never lost a real money game since I was old enough to spell 'Weeli Mesconi'."&lt;ref name="NBN 1980-04"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Minnesota Fats vs. Everybody|journal=National Billiards News|page= 22|date=April 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two competed on Valentine's Day (February 14), 1978 in a televised match on ABC's ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]''. With almost 11 million viewers, the game was the second-highest rated episode of the show for that year, behind only the [[Muhammad Ali]] vs. [[Leon Spinks]] rematch. The game was held at New York's [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Astoria Hotel]], and was announced by [[Howard Cosell]].&lt;ref name=dyer212&gt;Dyer (2003), p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wanderone lost the game, he won the audience with his banter, and with his joking manner. Mosconi on the other hand was reportedly perceived as cold.&lt;ref name=dyer212 /&gt;&lt;ref name="BD-TV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billiardsdigest.com/untold_stories/fats.php|title=TV Fiasco Spawned Mosconi–Fats Duel|first=R. A.|last=Dyer|work= BilliardsDigest.com|publisher=Luby Publishing|access-date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Fats" lost a number of rematches to Mosconi in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the nationally-broadcast ''Resorts International Shoot-Out'' of October 1984&amp;nbsp;— Wanderone's last notable television appearance&amp;nbsp;— he finally turned the tables on his rival. The event began with a [[trick shot]] competition among four players&amp;nbsp;— Wanderone, Mosconi, [[Steve Mizerak]], and [[Allen Hopkins (pool player)|Allen Hopkins]].

Next, Hopkins and Fats played against Mosconi and Mizerak in doubles [[seven-ball]], then [[nine-ball]]. Wanderone and Mosconi ultimately played a one-on-one game of seven-ball; Wanderone won the match. During the exhibition, a very quiet and genteel Mosconi blocked Wanderone's rough-and-tumble banter by wearing ear plugs; yet that failed to stop Wanderone from putting on a show for his fans.&lt;ref name="NBN 1984-10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Stars of Resort Shoot-Out|page= 21|journal=National Billiards News|date=October 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Wanderone was asked about his strategy to defeat Mosconi, and replied that he had thought to himself, "I'll make &amp;#91;the 7 ball&amp;#93; on the break and end it&amp;nbsp;... then I'll help carry Willie out on a stretcher."&lt;ref name="NBN 1984-11"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Shootout on the Boardwalk|page= 11|journal=National Billiards News|date=November 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
The [[Billiard Congress of America]] in 1984 inducted Wanderone into its [[Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] for "Meritorious Service" in recognition of his contributions to helping popularize the game of pool.&lt;ref name="BCA 1984"&gt;{{cite web|title=BCA Hall of Fame Inductees|publisher=Billiard Congress of America|work=BCA-Pool.com|url=http://www.bca-pool.com/cgi/site/framegate.cgi?url=http://www.bca-pool.com/industry/hof/hof.shtml&amp;cat=i|access-date=May 12, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107180531/http://www.bca-pool.com/cgi/site/framegate.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bca-pool.com%2Findustry%2Fhof%2Fhof.shtml&amp;cat=i|archivedate=January 7, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Wanderone abandoned his wife, Evelyn; they divorced a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanderone moved into the [[Hermitage Hotel]] in downtown [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1985, remaining there for several years. In 1992, while undergoing surgery for a knee injury, he suffered a massive heart attack, but survived. In 1993, he met and married his second wife, Theresa Ward Bell. He lived in Bell's Nashville house until his death on January 15, 1996, four days shy of his 83rd birthday,&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), pp. 220–21&lt;/ref&gt; although some sources, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', erroneously gave the date of his death on January 18.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt;
  
Wanderone had no known children. Singer [[Etta James]] said she believed that he was her biological father, having reportedly been told this by her mother, as well as by others who knew her mother and whom James described as "people who were there and should know".&lt;ref name=James&gt;James, Etta and David Ritz. ''Rage to Survive'' (New York: [[Villard (imprint)|Villard Books]], 1995); {{ISBN|0-679-42328-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no published evidence of such a relationship. James and Wanderone are only known to have met once, in 1987.&lt;ref name="Quan 2002"&gt;{{cite web|last=Quan|first=Denise|title=A Life Singing the Blues|work=CNN.com|publisher=CNN|date=September 19, 2002|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Music/09/19/mjazz.02.etta.james/index.html|access-date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her autobiography, ''Rage to Survive'', James recounted their meeting, writing that Wanderone neither confirmed nor denied his paternity. According to James, he told her that he did not recall the details of his life at the time of her conception well enough to know whether he could have been the father.&lt;ref name=James/&gt;

The epitaph on his tombstone reads: "Beat every living creature on Earth. 'St. Peter, rack 'em up.&amp;nbsp;—  Fats{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Headstciteone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TrueAnimal"&gt;{{cite web|title=True Animal Stories by Pool Hustler Rudolph Wanderone|publisher=Egyptian Area Agency on Aging, Inc.|work=EgyptianAAA.org|year=2008|url=http://egyptianaaa.org/SI-MinnesotaFats.htm|access-date=May 12, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419181856/http://www.egyptianaaa.org/SI-MinnesotaFats.htm|archivedate=April 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal character==
Wanderone was known for ostentation, self-aggrandizement, tall tales, fast-talk, and entertaining banter. He was even publicly recognized by famed boaster [[Muhammad Ali]] as better at boasting.&lt;ref name="TrueAnimal"/&gt; His critical biographer, R.&amp;nbsp;A. Dyer, documents that Wanderone completely fabricated a "here-by-fate" tale about a car wreck which brought the player to Little Egypt; it was a tale that Wanderone encouraged to spread and further embellished in his autobiography, to lend an air of the mystical to his public persona.&lt;ref name=dyer4659&gt;Dyer (2003), pp. 49–56&lt;/ref&gt; He made false claims about beating Willie Mosconi so frequently that Mosconi filed a [[Defamation|slander]] lawsuit, to little avail.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer (2003), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dyer, Wanderone was notorious for non-stop chatter on subjects about which he knew little, or stories about himself.&lt;ref name=dyer4659/&gt; At the beginning of his first television match against Mosconi, Wanderone claimed "I've never lost &amp;#91;a game&amp;#93; for money in my ''life''; beat everyone that ever lived."&lt;ref name=dyer212/&gt; Yet, as Dyer concedes, "Pool hustlers are, by nature, liars. And by this measure, Minnesota Fats was just a very, very good pool hustler."&lt;ref name="Dyer 2003, p. 35"/&gt;

Wanderone was a lover of animals, and was reported to have had dozens of cats and dogs simultaneously, and to have devoted a lot of time to finding homes for strays. "I'm crazy about every living creature", he wrote in ''The Bank Shot''.&lt;ref name="BankShot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TrueAnimal"/&gt; "It doesn't matter what it happens to be. I even love insects; in fact, I wouldn't swat a fly or a mosquito for a whole barrel of gold."
 
Remembered well for his turns of phrase and his [[pun]]s, Wanderone once wrote, "If you happened to drive from Mobile to [[Dowell, Illinois|Dowell]] [Illinois] with a carload of pool hustlers, you would get bit so hard and so often that you would need a malaria vaccine and a new bankroll as well", a reference not only to the area's notorious [[mosquito]]s but also the predatory nature of hustlers.&lt;ref name="BankShot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TrueAnimal"/&gt; Wanderone is remembered for saying on his way out a pool room door, "Boys, the only difference between me and everybody else is that everybody else drives around in a Volkswagen, and Minnesota Fats drives around in a [[Duesenberg]]."&lt;ref name="IPMag 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Fatty|journal=InsidePOOL Magazine|page= 8|date=April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanderone would go virtually anywhere to help promote the game, and he was a crowd-pleaser.&lt;ref name="NBN 1976"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=PPPA World Tournament|journal=National Billiard News|page= 8|date=September 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanderone owned various limousines throughout his career. He once toured the country in a colorful [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]] limousine, with his extended moniker painted along the side panels in translucent paint, changing colors as it moved with the reflections from the Sun: "Minnesota Fats, King of Pool".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} His 1980 [[Cadillac Fleetwood]] limousine was later in the Nashville auto museum, until the facility closed.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Wanderone was notorious for his spontaneous wit. When he was named the "uncrowned king" of pool because he never got actively involved in tournament circles (due to being too busy hustling)&lt;!--And had a major problem with the BCA and its dress code requirements - add this with Dyer 2003 source later--&gt;, his reply: "You judge a king by the size of his wallet and his palace. You can leave the crown in the toilet."&lt;ref name="Stutz 1982"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stutz|first=Ellen|title=Legends of Pocket Billiard Stars Tournament|journal=National Billiard News|page= 11|date=February 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13652">This is an overview of '''[[festival]]s and observances''' held as part of the practice of '''[[Ryukyuan religion]]''' or tradition on the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. Unless otherwise noted, dates are according to the [[lunar calendar]]. The categories below ("January - May" and "June - December") are artificial, created for ease of article navigation. For calendars of rites particular to [[Miyako-jima]], [[Yaeyama Islands|Yaeyama]], and [[Ishigaki, Okinawa|Ishigaki]], see their respective pages.

Viewing of or participation in rituals may be forbidden to outsiders, especially in rural areas which tend to be skeptical of the spiritual influence/significance of a stranger's presence. For example, Panari Island's ''Akamarakuromata'' Harvest Festival is open only to Panari people; no media or non-Panari are allowed.[https://web.archive.org/web/20051225190422/http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/025/en/card/7-3-3.html]

==January - May observances==
*31 December (solar calendar): ''Tushinuyuru'' (New Year's Eve). Amid celebration, garlic is used in different ways (according to local tradition) to banish and keep away evil spirits. ''Wakamiji'', the year's first drawn water, is set out as an offering to ancestors.
*1 January (solar calendar): ''Sougwachi'', (Jp. ''Shogatsu''; New Year's Day). Local religious leaders hold first rites of the New Year. Heads of household or first sons visit relatives and the elderly to present gifts. In the homes of senior citizens, a cup of ''[[awamori]]'' is enjoyed for good luck; in some places, slices of dried squid and salt are eaten. When visiting the heads of one's family, incense is offered to ancestors. Male members traditionally make these visits; however, these days wives and children may go along as well. Most people also visit a Shinto [[jinja (shinto)|shrine (''jinja'')]] around this time of year to make a New Year's wish and draw a New Year's fortune (''[[omikuji]]'') to find out about their luck in the coming year; other common Japanese New Year traditions are upheld.
*4 January: Hinukan ''mukee''. The hinukan goes away from the kitchen and back to his own home from December 24 to 3 January. Matrons burn incense and make offerings (awamori, rice) at the kitchen hearth to welcome him home. Especially popular on the main island.
*16 January: ''Juuruku Nichi'' (Ancestors at the New Year). One of many holidays on which extend families gather at their tomb to make offerings (flowers, incense, awamori, food) and prayers, as well as to have a picnic and commune in the presence of their ancestors.
*Early February: ''Shimakusarashi'' (Purification of the Village). Especially popular in southern Okinawa. A cow is slaughtered, and its various parts used to ritually cleanse the community. The cow's blood is smeared with leaves onto walls and gates. Then the heart is boiled and presented at an utaki, ancient tombs, or the house of an especially old or powerful family. A rope, particularly a straw rope, is hung over paths at the edge of town to mark the reaches of the community's sanctuary and keep out evil influences. Bones of the cow are then tied to the string and the cow's meat is given out for communal consumption.
*3 March (solar calendar): ''Hamauri'' (Purification at the Beach). A holiday for girls and women, they often walk along the beach, and families collect shells. This is based upon the belief that walking on white sand is purifying. Some also believe that bad omens can be ignored if one walks beside the sea. Mugwort and rice cakes are eaten on this day.
*Early April (solar calendar): ''Shiimii'' (Chin. ''Qing-Ming''). Another Ryukyuan visitation of the ancestors' at the family tomb. Held at this time to appropriately begin spring and the year's agricultural work. Also celebrated is ''kami-ushiimii'', when family heads of a widely extended family all gather to commune with their common ancestors.
*14 April: ''Abushibarei'' (Ritual to Ward Off Pests). Grass is cut along the edges of fields; rats and insects are caught, put aboard small boats, and ritually set out to sea.
*Late April/Early May: ''Yamadumi'' (Taboo Against Loud Noise). Between April and May, it was forbidden to make loud noises (thus cut down trees). People believed the noise would cause wind that would destroy the crops; while the noise wouldn't cause the wind, the cutting down of trees would have destroyed natural windbreaks that truly did keep the crops safe.
*May 4: ''[[Yukka Nu Hii]]'', ''Haarii''/''Haarei'' Races ([[Dragon boat|Dragon Boat]] Races). Teams of local men race dragon-shaped boats amid rituals of tribute to sea gods. Boat races in connection with prayers to ensure good fishing have been staged since the 14th century, and today's races arose from the mixing of two traditions: the fishermen's races on the sea and the dragon boat ceremonies performed on rivers and lakes in China. Traditionally the races are held on the fourth day of the fifth lunar month, but in Naha they are now staged on May 4 (solar calendar), to match the tourist season of "Golden Week". The largest races are in Naha, Itoman, and Tamagusuku; similar races are also held on any of the islands where people from Okinawa Island have settled (Yonaguni, Ishigaki, etc.).

==June - December observances==
*June: ''Umachii''/''Shichuma''/''Shikyoma''/''Awa Shichuma'' (Harvest Festivals/Millet Festivals). Families pray together giving thanks for a good harvest and seeking future prosperity.
*June 25: ''Kashichii'' (Rice Offering to Ancestors). Rice steamed with red beans and offered to ancestors as thanks for a good harvest. Also may be celebrated in August.
*July: ''Shichigwachi'' (Miyako ''sutugatsu'', Yaeyama ''souron''). Shichigwachi, or "Seventh Month", is the [[Ghost Festival|Ghost Month]] marked with a midmonth [[veneration of the dead]] (v.s.). Marital rites and other celebrations are tabboo during lunar July due to its rituals involving the presence of the dead.
*July: ''Shinugu'' ("for men and brothers"). Somewhat similar to Miyako-jima's ''Pantu'' rite. At Ada near Kunigami Village in the northern part of Okinawa, males climb up into the mountains and pray to the mountain gods for prosperity and a good harvest. They also face the direction of the sea and call upon the sea gods for the same. Then they ritually assume the godforms of mountain deities by covering themselves with leaves and crowning themselves with red flowers. They carry branches down into the community and together purify it by waving the branches over its borders and its fields. In a rite called ''sakankei'', the men receive ritual libations as offerings to the gods whose forms they have assumed.
*July: ''Unjami''/''Ungami''. At Shioya Bay, [[Ogimi, Okinawa|Ogimi Village]] in the northern part of Okinawa, priestesses invoke the gods of the sea for prosperity and good fishing. Some priestesses call to the gods from a place in a boat out on the water, and then assume the forms of the gods, much as the men of Kunigami assume the form of the mountain gods during Shinugu (v.s.). They return to the shore, greeted by other priestesses and hosted in a ritual tent. They make blessings and receive libation offerings, then visit area villages. Finally, the gods are seen off by local people who gather on the beach.
*July 7: ''[[Tanabata]]''. Wishes are written on strips of paper and hung from [[bamboo]] trees. Families also visit graves with offerings to invite ancestors to the following week's Obon. (Ooshiro 17)
*July 13–15 or 16: [[Obon]] Festival featuring ''[[Eisa (dance)|Eisa Dancing]]''. During Obon, ancestors are believed to gather ''en masse'' with their living relatives. Prayers and offerings such as incense, food, alcohol, and flowers are all made three times a day. Like Shiimii and New Year's Eve (v.s.), Obon is a significant holiday in the ancestors worship of Ryukyu religion, and the attendance of members of extended families is almost required. The first day of Obon is called ''unkee''. The family altar and memorial tablets cleaned and decked with incense, fruit, and sugarcane (''uji'') offerings. A simple offering of rice, beans, and water (''minnuku'') is prepared for spirits who receive no regular attention and accompany ancestors into the home. Often offerings may spill over onto low tables set up in front of the buchidan. On the offerings may be placed a ''sangwaa'' ([[Ryukyuan religion#Objects of power|v.inf.]]) The family gate (''jo'') is then lit with pine torch, candles, or incense. The second day (''naka nu hi'') is rather uneventful. At close to midnight on the third day (''uukui''), people have a farewell gathering for their ancestors. A large meal with the best food is presented. Then incense and paper money called ''uchikabi'' (representing money for the world of the dead, like Chinese [[Joss paper]] or [[Hell Bank Notes]]) is burned. All remaining offerings are gathered and set outdoors, and ancestors are sent away. Eisa dancing traditionally ends Obon, the drums sending the ancestors away with respect and blessings. (Ooshiro 17-18)
*August: ''Shishimai'' Dances ("[[Lion dance|Lion Dances]]") at harvest festivals. At various midmonth festivals around the Ryukyu Islands, shishimai dances are performed to consecrate the festival ground and open the festival. A wooden lion mask and wooly-looking costume of woven and dyed banana/choma strips is worn, and the dance is performed to loud music featuring gongs, drums, bells, flutes, sanshin, and various other instruments. Some lion dances feature two or more dancers as the lion.
*August: Tugs-of-War. Midmonth August festivals often feature a communal tug-of-war using a giant fiber rope that can often take days to weave. The rope in Naha is over 200m long and weighs more than 40 metric tons. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929131415/http://www.lsi.ie.u-ryukyu.ac.jp/~phdang/gallery/festival102004] A similar tug-of-war takes place in [[Uiryeong County|Korea]]. [http://www.uiryeong.go.kr/english/m05/m05_s02.htm]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}
*9 August - 15 August: ''Tou Udui'' Dance ([https://web.archive.org/web/20050206122123/http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/007/english/point/tuken/index.html Tsuken Island], [[Katsuren, Okinawa|Katsuren]]). A men's circle dance of Chinese origin performed in traditional summer dress to the accompaniment of small hand-held drums.
*10 August: Beginning of Yabu Dance Festival (near [[Nago, Okinawa|Nago]]). At this performance festival's roots are priestess prayers of thanks and hope concerning this year's harvest and that of the next. There are parades of dancers and various other folk performances, including formal ''Yotsudaki'' and ''Kumiodori'' dances. Similar dance festivals are held throughout Okinawa, notably on [[Ie-shima]], who now celebrate after the harvest in November.
*13 August and 15 August (every five years): ''Ayachi'' Shishi [[Marionette]] Performances at Jana (near [[Nakijin, Okinawa|Nakijin]]). A stage show is held, at the end of which a pair of shishi marionettes, a male and a female, dance and play together accompanied by [[sanshin]] and drumming.
*15 August: ''Taa Faa Kuu'' Dance (in Iju in [[Nakagusuku, Okinawa|Nakagusuku]]). A dance of Chinese origin, performed originally at Kume but brought to Nakagusuku for performance during harvest. It is energetic and features Chinese-style costumes and props.
*15 August: ''Masutoriya'' at [[Ueno, Okinawa|Ueno]]. A traditional staff dance accompanied by harvest prayer.
*September: ''Kami Ugami'' (prayer pilgrimages). During September, people visit various sacred sites to pay respects to famous Ryukyu ''kami''. Especially popular are areas around [[Nakijin, Okinawa|Nakijin]] ([[Nakijin gusuku]]) and [[Shuri Castle]].
*13 November: ''Amidushi'' ("lowering the nets") fishing ritual on Kudaka. Priests and three priestesses pray and make offerings of alcohol and rice to sea gods in order to ensure good fishing. Seven temporary enclosures are built by the sea to provide shelter for the visiting gods.
*15 November: ''Izaihoo'' on [https://web.archive.org/web/20050206132922/http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/007/english/point/kudaka/index.html Kudaka Island]. No longer performed due to lack of women to take on priestess roles. Performed every twelve years during every Year of the Horse. A four-day, four-stage initiation ritual, ordaining all women of the island between 31 and 40 as priestesses (v.s.).
*8 December: ''Muuchii'' (Jp. ''[[Mochi (food)|mochi]]'') Offerings. Muuchii, or rice cakes wrapped in ''sannin'' leaves, are offered to signal the beginning of winter and pray for the health of the family. Where there are children, the muuchii are tied to strings and hung, the number of muuchii tied up being determined by the child's age. Where a child has been born that year, ''hachi muuchii'' is celebrated, when the parents visit their neighbors and family to give out muuchii.

The '''Shina''', also known as the '''Shin''' are a [[Dardic people|Dardic]] tribe residing in southern [[Gilgit–Baltistan]], [[Chitral]] and the western part of the [[Kohistan District, North West Frontier Province|Kohistan district]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]], as well as the [[Dras|Dras Valley]] and [[Gurais|Kishenganga Valley]] in the northern region of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[India]]. They speak an Indo-Aryan language, called [[Shina language|Shina]], which has varied dialects, such as [[Brokskat language|Brokskat]].&lt;ref name="Crane1956"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crane|first=Robert I.|title=Area Handbook on Jammu and Kashmir State|accessdate=11 August 2017|year=1956|publisher=University of Chicago for the Human Relations Area Files|language=English|page=179|quote=Shina is the most eastern of these languages and in some of its dialects such as the Brokpa of Dah and Hanu and the dialect of Dras, it impinges upon the area of the Sino-Tibetan language family and has been affected by Tibetan with an overlay of words and idioms.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
In Pakistan, the Shina people are found in [[Shinkari]] (the part of the Indus Valley below Gor near [[Ghorband]]), Gor, [[Chilas]], Tangir, the Indus Valley below Sazin, and the upper part of the [[Gilgit Valley]] above Ponyal.&lt;ref&gt;A glossary of the tribes and castes of the Punjab and NorthWest provinces, compiled by H.A. Rose, vol III Page 405&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2016}} Many Shina people have also migrated to Karachi and Islamabad for employment, carrying out business, and education purposes, and many of them have permanently settled in these cities.

In India, the Shina people are found in Gurais, as well as in [[Dah Hanu]] and beyond the city of [[Leh]].&lt;ref name="Prakāśaṃ2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prakāśaṃ|first=Vennelakaṇṭi|title=Encyclopaedia of the Linguistic Sciences: Issues and Theories|year=2008|publisher=Allied Publishers|language=English|isbn=9788184242799|page=143|quote=Shina (described as spoken in many dialects in Gilgit, Chilas, etc., as far south as Gurez in Kashmir, and Dah Hanu in Baltistan, even beyond Leh.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Shina people originally practiced [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref name="1880Biddulph"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh|accessdate=11 August 2017|author=[[John Biddulph]]|year=1880|publisher=Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing |location=Calcutta|language=English |pages=39, 115|quote=In Nager there is a caste called Shoto, which exists nowhere else; they work in leather, and rank below the Doms, who take daughters from them without giving in return ... like the Shins they have come from the south to settle in these valleys. The names of many of the rules and of a number of places, not only in the Indus and Gilgit Valleys, but also in the Chitral Valley, point to a Brahminical origin. Amongst the names of places may be mentioned ''Seo'' (Siva, ''or'' Mahadeo), ''Shogram'' (Siva's village), ''Shogoor'' (Siva's priest), and ''Swami'' ... some form of Brahminism was introduced by the Shins into the Gilgit Valley, and, to a greater or less degree, wherever their rule extended. In valleys in which they were outnumbered by the former inhabitants, the result was, doubtless, a mixture of Buddhism and Hindooism, grafted on a form of demon-worship existing in the country.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'LearyRensch1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Leary|first1=Clare F.|last2=Rensch|first2=Calvin Ross|last3=Decker|first3=Sandra J.|title=Sociolinguistic Survey of Northern Pakistan: Languages of Chitral|accessdate=11 August 2017|year=1992|publisher=National Institute of Pakistan Studies at Quaid-i-Azam University|language=English|quote=Phalura had previously been Hindus like the Shin. He referred to the area around Chilas, south of Gilgit, as Dangaristan and discussed how the term Dangarik has been applied to the Shina-speaking people.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HastingsSelbie1917"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hastings|first1=James|last2=Selbie|first2=John Alexander|title=Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics: Mundas-Phrygians|accessdate=11 August 2017|year=1917|publisher=[[C. Scribner's Sons]]|language=English|page=606|quote=But the Shins have the characteristic Hindu aversion to eating the flesh of milk (or even ''ghī'' made from the milk) of the cow, and eschew fowls and fish. The former language of the people was Sanskrit, and the dialect now in use is called Shina. The basic element in the people is thus probably Indo-Aryan, and their festivals preserve many traces of Hindu beliefs.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="1880Biddulph"/&gt; As such, the Shina, particularly the Dangariké caste, were referred to by their neighbours as "[[Cattle in religion and mythology#Hinduism|cow people]]".&lt;ref name="O'LearyRensch1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgenstierne1941"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgenstierne|first=Georg|title=Notes on Phalūṛa: an unknown Dardic language of Chitral|accessdate=11 August 2017|year=1941|publisher=J. Dybwad|language=English|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, the Hindu Shina formerly practiced [[Sati (practice)|sati]], which ceased before A.D. 1740.&lt;ref name="Biddulph1880"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh|accessdate=11 August 2017|author=[[John Biddulph]]|year=1880|publisher=Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing |location=Calcutta|language=English |pages=114|quote=Women's urns are readily distinguished by a number of wooden spindle whorls, mixed with the bones. ... in Gilgit, Gor, Hunza, and Nager, that suttee was formerly practiced. The dead man, with his finest clothese and his weapons girded on him was plpaced on the pyre, and as the fire burnt up, the woman arrayed in her jewellery and her richest clothes, leaped into the flames. The burning of the dead ceased to be practised more than sixty years ago. ... in 1877, a very old man in Darel scandalised his neighbors by calling his sons to him on his death bed, and after having his arms and valuables brought to him, desiring to be burnt with them when dead ... He and a man of Gor, who died twenty years ago, are known to have always refused to be circumcized, or to call themselves Mohommedans. They were probably the very last Hindus in Dangaristan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1877, in that region, marked the last year that Shina men underwent Hindu [[Antyesti|cremation rites]].&lt;ref name="Biddulph1880"/&gt; Many castes of the Shina people, such as the Açar'îta, converted to [[Islam]] in the 19th century and this faith is now observed by the majority of the ethnic group.&lt;ref name="SchmidtKohistani2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmidt|first1=Ruth Laila|last2=Kohistani|first2=Razwal|title=A Grammar of the Shina Language of Indus Kohistan|year=2008|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|language=English|isbn=9783447056762|page=11|quote=The Açar'îta themselves told Strand that they have been living in Ashret for "for these approximately eight of nine hundred years as the Shina tribe... We are still making our lives in this homeland, and our language is Shina. We are one people from Chilas; originally, we are from Chilas." ... Biddulph mentions that many Muslims Shins had the surname "Sing". It is also a Rajput name, and the earlier form ''siṃha'' is a frequent element in the colophons of the Gilgit Manuscripts (dateable to probably not later than the 9th century C.E.). Bota/bôTâ appears to be a cognate with Bóṭi. The conversion to Islam among the Açar'îta appears to have taken place, according to Strand, between 1820-1840 C.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Shina people, such as those residing in [[Dah Hanu]], continue to practice Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Hattaway2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hattaway|first=Paul|title=Peoples of the Buddhist World|year=2004|publisher=William Carey Library|language=English|isbn=9780878083619|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Islamic Hindu Shin names==
{{cquote|Of the Shin names a great number have the suffix of ''[[Singh|Sing]]'', which is retained in spite of the conversion of the people to Islam. These names are never found among the purely Boorish population of Hunza and Nager, but it is to be noted that the Suffix ''Sing'' is found among the earlier Makpon Kings of [[Skardu|Iskardo]]. The suffix is local version of Hindu Surname ''[[Singh]]'' which coms from [[Sanskrit]] word ''Simha'' meaning ''Lion''. It is generally used by [[Kshatriya]] ruling class.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh John Biddulph Sang e meel Publications Page 99&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Festivals==   
The Shina festival of ''Chili'' marks the commencement of wheat sowing, as with other celebrations in the [[Indian subcontinent]], including [[Lohri]] and [[Makar Sakranti]]. ''Chilli'' also formerly had a connection with the worship of the [[Cedar wood|cedar]].&lt;ref&gt;The making of a frontier Five years' experiences and adventures in Gilgit By Algernon George Arnold Durand Page 210&lt;/ref&gt; Cedar worship is prevalent among historic the Hindu communities of [[Himalayas]], from the Hindu Kush region to [[Himachal]] and [[Uttarakhand]]. It is known as [[Cedrus deodara|Deodar]], which is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Devadaru'', which means "wood of the gods" and is a compound of the words ''deva'' (god) and ''dāru'' (wood, etym. tree). The Cedar is also sacred in [[Kafiristan]].&lt;ref&gt;The making of a frontier Five years' experiences and adventures in Gilgit By Algernon George Arnold Durand Page 209&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Singapore Police Force''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''SPF'''; {{lang-ms|Pasukan Polis Singapura}}; {{zh|c=新加坡警察部队}}; {{lang-ta|சிங்கப்பூர் காவல் துறை}}) is the main government agency tasked with [[Law enforcement in Singapore|maintaining law and order]] in the island [[Singapore|city-state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photius.com/countries/singapore/national_security/singapore_national_security_public_order_and_int~1587.html Singapore PUBLIC ORDER AND INTERNAL SECURITY - Flags, Maps, Economy, History, Climate, Natural Resources, Current Issues, International Agreements, Population, Social Statistics, Political System]&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly known as the ''Republic of Singapore Police'' (''RSP''; {{lang-ms|Polis Republik Singapura}}), it has grown from an 11-man organisation to a 38,587 strong force. Singapore has been ranked consistently in the top five positions in the [[Global Competitiveness Report]] in terms of its reliability of police services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GCR_Report_2011-12.pdf |title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2011-2012 |website=World Economic Forum |accessdate=2 May 2015 |page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2012–2013 |url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2012-13.pdf |website=World Economic Forum |accessdate=2 May 2015 |page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2013–2014 |url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2013-14.pdf |website=World Economic Forum |accessdate=2 May 2015 |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisational structure of the SPF is split between the staff and line functions, roughly modeled after the military. There are currently 17 staff departments, 3 specialist staff departments and 17 specialist and line units, including 7 land divisions. The headquarters is located in a block at New Phoenix Park in [[Novena, Singapore|Novena]], adjacent to a twin block occupied by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Phoenix Park |url=http://www.mha.gov.sg/About-Us/our-heritage/Pages/our-heritage.aspx#HeritageTabs7 |website=Ministry of Home Affairs |accessdate=2 May 2015 |location=Year 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial History==

The Singapore Police Force is almost as old as modern Singapore. The Force was formed in 1820,&lt;ref name="challenge"&gt;Farquhar to Raffles, 5 May 1820, L.10, Straits Settlement Records.&lt;/ref&gt; with a skeleton force of 11 men under the command of [[Francis James Bernard]], son-in-law of [[William Farquhar]]. Farquhar informed Raffles that he had provisionally introduced licences for opium and alcohol sales that would raise $650 per month, with $300 of this sum being used to run a small police department.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar to Raffles, 2 November 1819, L. 10, Straits Settlement Records.&lt;/ref&gt; As the department took form, Bernard became in charge of a Malay writer, one jailor, one ''jemadar'' (sergeant) and eight ''peada'' (constables) by May 1820.&lt;ref name="challenge" /&gt; Raffles approved these arrangements by August 1820, and cemented the formal establishment of a police force in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings to Farquhar, 15 August 1820, L. 4, Straits Settlement Records.&lt;/ref&gt; Manpower constraints meant that the men had to perform a wide range of roles, and required the help of headmen among the various ethnic communities to maintain orderliness on the streets, all the more possible as the communities lived in segregated areas around the city.

This partnership with the community was in line with Sir [[Stamford Raffles]]' vision of a thriving colony largely self-regulated by local social structures, with the British masters administrating it via indirect rule. The large influx of migrants from China, however, began to test this system when the hands-off approach by the British allowed [[secret societies in Singapore]] to thrive. Although originally formed with legal intentions of community bonding and the provision of assistance to fellow migrants, these societies gradually became influential, competitive, and increasingly engaged in illegal activity including monetary extortion from the masses, the operation of gambling dens, and the [[smuggling]] of illegal goods on top of more legal commercial operations to meet their financial needs.

Competition gradually heated up between large rival factions, such as that between the larger [[Ghee Hin Kongsi]], the [[Ghee Hock Kongsi]] and the [[Hai San Kongsi]]. Murders, mass riots, kidnappings, arson and other serious crimes became commonplace in the next four decades since the colony's founding. Faced with violent acts of crime which may involve thousands, such as the [[funeral riots]] of 1846 involving 9,000 members from the Ghee Hin and Ghee Hock secret societies, the police force was woefully incapable of bringing the situation under control, and often had to call in the army for assistance. The escalating number of serious crimes prompted the need for stronger legislation to deter would-be criminals. Singapore's first [[Execution (legal)|executions]] were thus held in the wake of the first criminal session in June 1828, when a Chinese and Indian were found guilty and convicted for murder.

Headed by Europeans and predominantly staffed by Malay and Indian officers, the force had little Chinese representation as the military and policing professionals were traditionally shunned by the Chinese community, which therefore impaired policing efforts among the large Chinese populace. In 1843, the force comprised a sitting [[magistrate]] doubling up as a [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]], three European [[constables]] and an assistant native constable, 14 officers and 110 policemen. With a total strength of no more than 150 men, the police was compelled to avoid direct intervention in these mass acts of violence, else risking almost total annihilation.

A repeat of this scenario occurred in 1851, when lingering displeasure against [[Roman Catholic]] ethnic Chinese erupted into major rioting leaving over 500 Chinese dead. The army was called in again, although it involved having to induct Indian convicts into military service almost overnight. In 1854, twelve consecutive days of violence sparked by a dispute between the Hokkiens and Teochews disrupted trade. This particular incident led to the formation of the military's [[Singapore Rifle Corps]] on 8 July 1854, the earliest predecessor of the [[Singapore Armed Forces]]' [[military|People's Defence Force]] today.

However, criminal violence was not merely in the domain of the ethnic Chinese. Rivalries between Malay princes and communities also often result in acts of violence, which prompted the passing of Singapore's first [[arms law]] in March 1823 restricting the right to bear arms to 24 of the Malay Sultan's followers. Nearly two centuries later, these anti-arms laws continue to be strictly enforced, resulting in a society relatively free from firearms-related criminal offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Singapore - Gun Facts, Figures and the Law |url=http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/singapore |website=GunPolicy.org |accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finances==
The Singapore Police Force receives the highest budget allocation annually as compared to the various departments of the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] (MHA), typically accounting for about 50% of its annual budget. For the fiscal year of 2013 (for the year beginning 1 April 2013), S$3.89 billion was budgeted to the MHA, of which 47.8%, or S$1.86 billion was allocated for the Police Programme. Actual expenses in the 2013 fiscal year was S$2.04 billion, of which S$1.88 billion was spent on operating expenditure (against the budgeted S$1.79 billion) and S$159.1 million on development expenditure (budgeted at $71.83 million).&lt;ref name=MHAbudgetannex2015&gt;{{cite web |title=Ministry of Home Affairs Annex 2015 |url=http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/data/budget_2015/download/38%20MHA%20Annex%202015.pdf |website=Singapore Budget |publisher=Ministry of Finance |accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manpower costs amounting to S$1.16 billion continue to dominate the SPF's expenditure, accounting for 61.7% of its operating expenditure and 56.9% of total expenditure in FY2013.&lt;ref name="MHAbudgetannex2015"/&gt;

===Regulars===
Regulars, or uniformed, full-time officers, constitute about 20% of the police's total workforce and number approximately 9,000 in strength. Basic entry requirements for police officers include normal fitness levels, good eyesight, and at least five passes in the GCE Ordinary level or a NITEC from the [[Institute of Technical Education]], although those with lower qualifications may still be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/po_entry.htm#top |title=Singapore Police Force—Police Officer Entry Requirements |publisher=Spf.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those joining the senior police officers require a basic degree from a recognised university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/so_entry.htm#top |title=Singapore Police Force—Senior Police Officer Entry Requirements |publisher=Spf.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, police officers from the junior ranks may also be considered for promotion into the senior ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20080826-84339.html |title=Retention bonus for police |publisher=Asiaone.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officers serving in the force as national servicemen are also regularly considered for absorption into the regular scheme. Basic training for all officers are conducted at the [[Home Team Academy]], under the purview of the Police Training Command. It takes about six months&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/po_training.htm#top |title=Singapore Police Force—Police Officer Training and Postings |publisher=Spf.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nine months&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/so_training.htm#top |title=Singapore Police Force—Senior Police Officer Training and Postings |publisher=Spf.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to train a new police officer and senior police officer respectively.

As is the case with many other civil service positions in Singapore, the salaries of police officers are reviewed in accordance to market rates. Salaries are kept competitive as part of anti-corruption measures. Gross starting salaries for police officers may range from S$1,820 to S$2,480,&lt;ref name="PO career"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://morethanjustajob.spf.sg/#!uniformed_careers/content/6 |website=More than Just a Job |title=Police Officer |publisher=Singapore Police Force |accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that of senior police officers from S$3,400 to S$4,770,&lt;ref name="SO career"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://morethanjustajob.spf.sg/#!uniformed_careers/content/4 |website=More than Just a Job |title=Senior Police Officer |publisher=Singapore Police Force |accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on entry qualifications, relevant/useful work experiences and National Service.

Police officers commence their careers as Sergeants (Full GCE 'A' level or Diploma holders),&lt;ref name="PO career"/&gt; while senior police officers start as Inspectors (Bachelor's degree). Reviews of an officer's performance for promotion consideration are conducted annually. Interviews conducted for promotion to certain ranks were phased out since 1995. It takes approximately five years for a police officer to be promoted to the next rank, although the system allows for accelerated promotion for outstanding officers.

While joining the force as a career is generally considered a respectable decision in contemporary Singapore, support from the ethnic Malay community has been traditionally stronger due to less social stigma attached to the profession. Traditionally, Chinese culture has eschewed careers in uniformed positions, resulting in a force dominated by non-Chinese officers for most of the force's early history. National servicemen also contribute a higher proportion of ethnic Malays in the force. The current ethnic profile of the force continues to have a significantly higher proportion of ethnic minorities compared to the national ethnic profile, although such an outcome is related to operational demands: police resources are typically deployed with a diverse ethnic mix to decrease communication problems while attending to incidents in ethnically-diverse Singapore.

Competition in the employment market, usually heating up during economic boom times, occasionally depressed the number of police recruits as well as its existing ranks. A series of major incidents in 2008 affecting agencies of the Home Affairs Ministry has led to the ministry conducting a study which concluded that there is a shortage of officers, resulting in officers being "overstretched, strained and over-stressed". In the police force, it was admitted that the recruitment and retention of non-graduate police officers has been "adversely affected by the tighter labour market", with resignation rates increasing by 50% between 2004 and 2007. Recruitment figures, while remaining relatively stable, has been unable to "address the higher demands placed on the Force. Various measures were thus taken in response, including an increase in starting salaries, sign-on bonuses for senior police officers, and retention bonuses of up to S$30,000 for non-graduate police officers in a bid to encourage them to stay for at least eight years, over the five years where many leave at the end of their service bonds.

When full-time [[National Service in Singapore|National Service]] (NS) was first introduced in Singapore way back in 1967, it was initially solely aimed and geared towards the building-up of the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF). Meanwhile, in Singapore's police force, NS was not extended to that of compulsory full-time service, with police NS being only part-time, unlike that of the SAF. There was little urgency and pressure for the police force to increase its overall manpower-strength until the [[Laju incident]] of 1974, Singapore's first encounter with international terrorism, demonstrated the need for additional trained reserve-officers who could be called up at short-notice in the event of a national crisis or a major and serious public emergency. Singapore's full-time National Service policy was thus extended to the Singapore Police Force in 1975, which stemmed from the then-primary aim of guarding and protecting key and vital public installations, such as sensitive ones like power substations and petro-chemical industries, and to act as a swift-response reserve unit. Subsequent expansion of this NS scheme, along with changing security needs and requirements and the trend in [[Outsource|outsourcing]] key-installation protection (such as to the various local [[Auxiliary Police|auxiliary police]] forces) has expanded the role of police national servicemen to more varied functions, which may range from mainstream administration and operations (such as the role of office-based Staff Assistants (SAs)), to basic police investigation (like under the Ground Response Force (GRF) of the SPF's Land Divisions) to frontline policing (as seen in the Police Coast Guard) alongside their regular counterparts.

===Volunteers===
{{Main|Volunteer Special Constabulary}}
Formed in 1946, The Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) is an important component of the Singapore Police Force, contributing more than fifty years of volunteer service to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About - Volunteer Special Constabulary |url=http://www.hometeamvolunteers.gov.sg/htvms/web/volunteerspecialconstabulary-individualpoliceofficer |accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VSC is composed of volunteers from all walks of life in Singapore, from businessmen to blue-collar executives to even bus captains, bonded with the same aspiration to serve the nation by complementing the Singapore Police Force. They are vested with equal powers of a police officer to enforce law and order in Singapore. VSC Officers don the same police uniform and patrol the streets, participate in anti-drug operations and sometimes even high-speed sea chases.

Previously headquartered at the [[Singapore Police Force#Land Divisions|Eu Tong Sen Street Police Station]] and [[Toa Payoh Police Station]], it relocated to the new [[Police Cantonment Complex]] in year 2000.

===Civilian staff===
Civilian staff in the Police Force are deployed in areas such as technology, logistics, human resource and administrative and finance services as well as investigation, planning and intelligence.&lt;ref name="SPF Civilian careers"&gt;{{cite web |title=Civilian Careers |url=http://morethanjustajob.spf.sg/#!civilian_careers |website=More Than Just a Job |publisher=Singapore Police Force |accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The civilian staff schemes falls under the general civil service schemes managed by the [[Public Service Division]]. These schemes include:
*Commercial Affairs Officer (CAO) Scheme for Accountancy, Law, Business Administration, Business or Economics degree holders
**Commercial Affairs Officer
*Home Team Specialist (HTS) Scheme for degree and diploma holders
**Home Team Specialist
*Home Affairs Senior Executive (HASE) Scheme for degree holders
**Management Executive (MX)
*Management Support Scheme for diploma holders and below
**Management Support Officer (MSO)
**Corporate Support Officer (CSO)
*Technical Support Scheme for diploma holders and below
**Technical Support Officer (TSO)

The civilization of non-core police functions have accelerated over the years in order to free up additional manpower for redeployment into Police Divisions. Other changes include the deployment of contract staff through organisations such as [[Ministry of Finance (Singapore)|Ministry of Finance]]'s VITAL.org for administrative staff and partners such as [[Singapore Technologies]] and [[Cyber Security Agency (Singapore)|Cyber Security Agency]] for technical support.

==Uniforms==
{{Main|Uniforms of the Singapore Police Force}}
Dark blue (or more accurately [[Dacron blue]]) is the organisational colour of the Singapore Police Force, and has remained so continuously since 1969, although the first police uniforms introduced in 1856 were also in the same colour.

On 1 July 1969, dacron blue made a comeback to the uniform with a force-wide change away from khaki overnight, in part to coincide with Singapore's 150th anniversary since its founding in 1819. The new uniform comprises a dark blue peak cap, shirt, trousers, black belt, shoes and socks, and coded whistle lanyard in blue and white. 3 large and 4 small metal buttons, metal collar badges, and a metal cap badge are affixed, and a black plastic name tag completes the uniform. Metallic ranks, if any, are fixed to the sleeve or on the shoulders for senior officers. The lanyard was changed to a metal chain in 1972, and in 1985, the material of the uniform was changed from 75% [[polyester]] 25% cotton to 100% polyester for ease of daily maintenance.

Derivatives of the standard blue uniform (collectively called the no.3 uniform) was adopted for specialized forces and for all officers in various occasions which calls for more formal or casual attire. The [[Traffic Police Department]] was among the few to move away from the all-blue attire, adopting a short-sleeved white tunic, dark blue [[breeches]], a black leather [[Sam Browne belt]], and riding boots for its officers performing [[mobile squad]] duties. A white crash helmet is worn when on the move, while a new dark blue [[Equestrian helmet|jockey cap]] with chequered white and dark blue patterns around its circumference is worn when convenient while performing static duty. Members of the [[Vigilante Corps]] are also attired by a white short-sleeved top similar in design to the dark blue version for normal officers, gold-coloured buttons and badges, and a dark blue [[beret]] in place of the [[peak cap]]. Parking wardens will be issued new uniforms to combat the heat.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/parking-wardens-new-uniforms-lta-hdb-ura-hotline-10564678&lt;/ref&gt;

Combat uniforms has also been adopted for specialist units such as those from the [[Special Operations Command (Singapore)|Special Operations Command]] and the [[Police Coast Guard]] (PCG), collectively known as the No.4 uniforms. These involve the replacement of metal buttons with sewn-on plastic ones, the avoidance of all other metallic accruements which are deemed potentially hazardous to the officer or to others and the use of long-sleeved shirts.

There was no major change to the uniform since then, except for the adoption of embroidered shoulder ranks and badges for all ranks in the 1990s. Other changes are less distinct, such as the upgrading of shoes used, the change of the belt material and belt buckle to one including the police crest, and the replacement of the peak cap with a baseball cap for NPC officers on front-line duty.

In the past, the police were using their standard issued drill boots for their daily duties; however, using of the drill boots for daily duties such as patrols and chasing after suspects proved impractical as they were severely uncomfortable, causing blisters, or worse, causing the officer to be injured. In 2012, the police trialed the Magnum Stealth Force 6.0 and 8.0, subsequently they became the standard issue for their officers. While the Special Operations Command were previously using the traditional full leather combat boot, the force also rolled out the Magnum Spider 8.1 SZ for their troopers. 

In 2008 - 2009, the black engraved plastic name-tags was changed to the black epoxy coated name-tags with the Home Team badge on the left. The name-tags with a safety-pinned backing were a safety hazard when struggling with suspects, progressively, the backing name-tags were fitted with Velcro for ease of fitting, and safety. The previous black engraved plastic name-tags is still in use by the [[National Police Cadet Corps]]. All officers under the Home Team are issued with these epoxy name-tags.

On April 16, 2018, the SPF has introduced new uniforms that are more stretchable, absorb perspiration better and dry faster, and they are made of 98% of polyester and 2% of spandex. The change in uniforms are part of ongoing efforts to enhance operational effectiveness and support in the officers' duty.

These uniforms are worn only by officers from Special Operations Command, the Public Transport Security Command and Ground Response Force when they work in front-line patrol and deployments. The word “police” is embroidered above the name tag of the new uniforms and the metallic buttons will be replaced with concealed plastic buttons for more comfort when officers put on the body vests over their uniforms. Riveted buttons are fixed on the shoulders for a [[body worn video|body worn camera]] to be attached.

==Ranks==
A standard rank structure is used throughout the police force, although some ranks may be unique to specific organisations. These ranks are denoted where applicable in the following list, which lists them in ascending seniority:

===Police officers===
The rank of Corporal was abolished in 1972, but reinstated in 1976. In 1997, all ranks were shifted from the sleeves to the epaulettes, except for the Gurkha Contingent. Also in the same year, the Station Inspector rank was changed from collar pips to epaulettes with a new design similar to that of the SAF Warrant Officers, and the rank of [[Senior Station Inspector]] was introduced. In 1998, the [[Senior Station Inspector (2)]] rank was introduced, and changes were made to the SI, SSI, and SSI(2) rank designs. The rank of Lance Corporal was abolished in 2002. The 2006, the Gurkha Contingent adopted embroidered ranks as part of an overhaul of its combat dress, but are worn on the right front pocket. There was a major rank overhaul in 2016 with the removal of the ranks of CPL, SSGT, SSI and SSI(2), as well as the removal of the distinction between "Police Officers" and "Senior Police Officers" in what is now called a "unified police scheme".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://morethanjustajob.spf.sg/#!uniformed_careers/content/6 |title=SPF - More Than Just A Job |website=Singapore Police Force - More Than Just A Job|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weapons==

Police officers in the various divisions are armed when conducting regular uniformed patrols and plainclothes duties. Officers from different units are issued with different weapons.

The standard layout of a regular right handed officer's duty belt / ops kit consists of the followings in a clockwise direction; 

# Ammunition pouch with speedloader containing five rounds of .38 special PMC cartridges. 
# [[Taurus Model 85]] revolver / [[CZ 75|CZ P-07]] pistol.
# A set of handcuffs. 
# [[Monadnock]] PR-21 T-Baton / [[ASP, Inc.|ASP]] Friction Loc 21" Extendable Baton / Bonowi EKA 21 Extendable Baton.
# Motorola MTP6550 Portable Radio Set. 
# [[Taser]] X26.

The five-shot .38 [[Taurus Model 85]] with 3-inch barrel featuring a laser sight by Crimson Trace is the standard issued sidearm of the Singapore Police Force with 10 rounds of ammunition. From 2016, the [[CZ 75|CZ P-07]] semi-automatic pistol will gradually replace the [[Taurus Model 85]] revolver in front-line policing. Extendable batons were initially used by specialist units such as Security Command and Speical Operations Command, however it has since been used by officers from other frontline units, replacing the [[Monadnock]] PR-21 side-handle baton. Sabre Red [[pepper spray]] canisters are exclusively equipped to the officers of [[Police Coast Guard]] and [[Police Tactical Unit (Singapore)|Police Tactical Unit]]. A pair of [[handcuffs]] is issued to the officers as restraints.

The [[TASER International|Taser]] [[Electroshock weapon#Taser|X26]] stun gun is part of the officer equipment, which provides another non-lethal means of subduing suspects. Despite some safety concerns due to incidents experienced by foreign police forces, the weapon was deemed suitable for use by trained personnel, and was rolled out across other NPCs.

[[Heckler &amp; Koch USP]] pistols are known to be used by the Special Operations Command, Police Tactical Unit, Criminal Investigation Department and Security Command. Officers of Police Coast Guard's Special Task Squadron are issued with [[Glock 19]] semi-automatic pistol and [[Special Tactics and Rescue (Singapore)|Special Tactics and Rescue]] (STAR) acquired the Swiss-made [[Sphinx 3000]] pistol, replacing the previous used Glock pistols.

Addition to the use of the handguns, Singapore Police Force also uses the [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]] sub-machine gun and the [[Remington 870]] shotgun while specialized weapons are issued to the STAR and KINS units, such as the [[Sphinx Systems|Sphinx 3000]], [[FN SCAR]], [[M4A1|M4S1]], [[M16A1|M16S1]], [[SIG 522LR|SIG-522]], [[Walther G22|G22]], [[SAR-21]] rifles, [[MATADOR]] anti-armor weapon system and a variegated arsenal of sniper rifles.

==Equipment==

The primary communication tool carried by each officer is through a common digital radio set used by Home Team organizations. In the first half of the 21st century, this was provided by Matra Nortel Communications/EADS based on [[TETRAPOL]] technology. In 2013, a contract was awarded to [[Motorola]] Communications for a replacement communication network (MCN2) using [[TETRA]] technology (Motorola Dimetra) with the first units being deployed in 2015. Whereas for secondary communication, officers are given the option to utilise the Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) or their personal issued Personal Digital Assistant, also known as Cubicon 2 in which real time information can be communicated between the officer and command center or ops room.

Strict enforcement of anti-arm laws which are in existence in Singapore since 1823 has resulted in a relatively disarmed society, where firearms-related crimes are rare. It is therefore not an operational requirement for police officers to wear [[bulletproof vest|bullet resistant vests]] when conducting normal policing duties. However, vests, helmets, and shields are carried in police vehicles and stocked in police establishments and can be rapidly utilize should the situation require it. In addition, chemical protection equipment such as suit, gloves, boots and NBC masks etc. are readily available to be drawn from the maintenance stores. Special units such as the KINS unit are known for utilising the skeletal battle order vest as a direct alternative to the ops kit belt for as they are issued with firearm magazines while on duty. From 2004, new multi-purpose vests were introduced which offer officers protection against most handgun fire, knife thrusts, as well as doubling up as a buoyancy vest should officers fall into deep water.

==Vehicles==
[[File:SG Police Force Toyota Corolla Altis E140.jpg|thumb|right|Toyota Corolla Altis wearing the new Singapore Police Force livery]]
Land division officers typically respond to calls in rapid-deployment vehicles known as the [[Fast Response Car]] (FRC). The SPF have been staunch users of Japanese-made [[saloon car]]s since the 1980s for patrol duties, with the mainstay models in use being the various generations of the [[Mitsubishi Lancer]]s, [[Mazda 323]]s and [[Toyota Corolla]]s. At the turn of the century they have also included [[Nissan Sunny]]s, [[Subaru Impreza]] 1.6 TS sedans (not to be confused with the [[Subaru Impreza WRX]] used by the Traffic Police) in 2012 the traffic police have included the Volvo S80 T5.

All FRCs carry a large array of equipment to allow officers to conduct normal policing duties and basic investigative work which officers are expected to perform with the implementation of the [[Neighbourhood Police Centre]] (NPC) system. A typical FRC vehicle may therefore stock equipment for the force-opening of locked doors, conducting [[roadblock]]s, [[fingerprint]] collection, and the provision of [[first aid]]. On top of these, chemical agent protection equipment, police shields and bulletproof vests are also carried for the officer's protection.

In 2002, the [[Fast Response Vehicle|Enhanced Patrol Vehicle Project]] was unveiled at the SPF's annual work-plan seminar to highlight the need for off-road capability. The [[Volvo V70|Volvo V70 AWD XC]], [[Mitsubishi Space Wagon]] and [[Mitsubishi Chariot]] underwent evaluation in various NPCs. Eventually, all NPCs were to have at least three of such vehicles, but the project was met with skepticism by some of the public, stating that the police need not use such "luxurious vehicles" for police patrols. In 2004, the new [[Fast Response Vehicle]] (FRV) was introduced, consisting of cheaper modified [[Toyota Hi-Lux]] [[sport utility vehicle]]s. These vehicles utilise diesel-power which provide greater ability to endure high usage on the roads over extensive periods of time. Their bigger storage space also allows for easier storage and retrieval of equipment.

In 2009, the SPF had introduced large truck-sized Forward Command Vehicles in which they were utilised for command and control during the simulated terrorist attacks in Singapore as part of Exercise Northstar VII.

Other vehicles typically used in NPCs include the [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] and vans. Bicycles, although currently less seen, are still used by land division officers belonging to the Community Policing Unit (CPU) occasionally, particularly when conducting routine patrols in large, sprawling private housing estates. At [[NDP 2007]], the Singapore Police Force unveiled a [[Tenix]] [[Shorland S600|S600 APC]] ([[Armored Personnel Carrier]]) had been purchased for its operations for the Special Operations Command and in [[National Day Parade, 2015|NDP 2015]], the Achleitner HMV Survivor and the [[Terradyne Armored Vehicles Gurkha|Gurkha MPV]] by Terradyne Armored Vehicles Inc was unveiled.

In 2017, the SPF had introduced new Division Command Vehicles with greater mobility designed to enhance command, control and coordination, as well as new unmanned aerial vehicles with red and blue siren lights, a searchlight, a high-definition camera and an audio warning system. The UAVs are controlled by two-man teams (consisting of a pilot and a safety officer) and are designed to conduct search and rescue operations, attending public order incidents, traffic management, hostage situations and crowd monitoring.

==Auxiliary Police Forces==
{{See also|Auxiliary police#Singapore}}
[[File:CISCO Security.jpg|thumb|A [[Certis CISCO]] auxiliary police officer stands guard beside an [[Armored car (valuables)|armoured truck]] at [[Change Alley (Singapore)|Change Alley]], Singapore.]]

In Singapore, '''auxiliary police officers''' are [[security police]] appointed under Section 92(1) or (2) of the Police Force Act 2004 and are vested with all the power, protection and immunity of a Police Officer of corresponding rank and are licensed to carry firearms when carrying out their duties.

These armed auxiliary police officers (APO) are full-time paid employees of their respective companies, and are not directly affiliated to the Singapore Police Force. They are appointed as auxiliary police officers only after attending and passing a residential course, the curriculum of which is set by the [[Security Industry Regulatory Dept.]] of the Singapore Police Force. Each APO is issued with a warrant card signed by the Commissioner Of Police of the Singapore Police Force.

*[[Aetos Security Management|Aetos Security Management Private Limited]] (CIAS / PSA / ST Kinetics)
*[[Certis CISCO|Certis CISCO Security Private Limited]] - The oldest and largest auxiliary.
*[[SATS Security Services|Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS)]] Auxiliary Police Force

There were also other auxiliary police forces in Singapore in the early years such as PSA Police, and Bukom Auxiliary Police. These APF were granted licences and powers under the Police Force Act to operate only in restricted geographical areas e.g. in the ports or airports or Pulau Bukom Island.

The Singapore Police Force (SPF) established the Security Industry Regulatory Department in 2004 to regulate the security industry.

More recently, the shortage of SPF officers has caused the role of auxiliary police forces to expand to enforcement, attending to road related incidents such as vehicle collision scenes and conducting patrol duties, even working alongside the Singapore Police Force themselves.

'''Social mobility in Japan''' refers to the upward and downward movement for Japanese from one social class to another. The vertical mobility can be the change in social status between parents and children, which is intergenerational movement; as well as the change over the course of a lifetime, which is intragenerational movement. After [[World War II]], Japan’s economy grew rapidly and stably. Japan achieved the high employment rate among developed countries as well as established a relatively equal class structure due to the rapid economy growth as well as its [[Permanent employment|life-time employment]] system, [[progressive tax]] policies, and [[social security]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Is Japan an Egalitarian Society, Japan Why It Works, Why It Doesn't: Economics in Everyday Life|last=H.|first=Oshima|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=195–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did the huge middle class establish the image of Japan’s “affluent society”, but also maintained the long-term stability of the running [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] in Japan, and verified the proposition that industrialization narrows down the social stratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D. J.|first=Treiman|date=1970|title=Industrialization and Social Stratification|url=|journal=Sociological Inquiry|volume=|pages=40: 207–234|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, Japan even created the myth of “100 million all in the middle class” (“ichi oku sochuryu”),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Stratification in Contemporary Japan|last=Kosaka|first=Kenji|publisher=Kegan Paul International|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that social satisfaction reached a high level and the middle class awareness maintained long-term stability.

One factor that contributed to social mobility in Japan was the rapid economic growth between 1955 and 1985 with Japan’s industrial structure changes. However, after the [[Economic bubble|bubble economy]] burst in 1990, Japan entered a period of development stagnation known as "[[Lost Decade (Japan)|The Lost Decade]]." Therefore, the occupational prestige, education levels, and assets among different social classes still existed and were not eliminated by industrialization. The trend of [[class stratification]] first appeared in the 1980s, and the main manifestations included the stagnation of equalized distribution, the fixation of employment patterns, and the narrowing gap between occupations. Therefore, wages and salaries were no longer the main variables in the [[economic stratification]]; instead, the difference in household assets became increasingly important in the economic stratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiavacci|first=David|date=Summer 2008|title=From Class Struggle to General Middle-Class Society to Divided Society: Societal Models of Inequality in Postwar Japan|jstor=30209598|journal=Social Science Japan Journal|volume= 11| issue =  1|pages= 5–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the bubble economy in the late 1980s, the huge wealth brought by the substantial appreciation of the [[Japanese yen]] was invested in stocks, securities, and real estate. The difference between financial assets and land prices rapidly expanded. Assets replaced wage income and became the determining factor of people’s economic status and consumption patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Time of Troubles: The Yen and Japan’s Economy, 1985–2008." In Japan's Bubble, Deflation, and Long-term Stagnation|last=Obstfeld|first=Maurice|publisher=MIT Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Murakami Yasusuke put forward the concept of "The Age of New Middle Mass Politics", where the middle class was defined as "middle level of standard of living", "conservative ideology", and a sign of social stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yasusuke|first=Murakami|date=Winter 1982|title=The Age of New Middle Mass Politics: The Case of Japan|jstor=132276|journal=The Journal of Japanese Studies|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, middle class was largely influenced and destabilized by the bubble economy burst in 1990, causing the instability of the whole society.

Furthermore, the implementation of public policies including employment policies, tax policies, and social security policies also contributed to a relatively equal class structure in Japanese society. First, in the 1960s, Japan's total unemployment rate remained at around 1% and raised to 1.3% after 1973. During this period, due to the drastic changes in the industrial structure, industries and enterprises kept upgrading and the unemployment during this period mainly consisted of structural unemployment. The employment measures were mainly aimed at consolidating the life-time employment system, protecting the disadvantaged groups, and improving the labor market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawcour|first=Sydeny|date=Summer 1978|title=The Japanese Employment System|jstor=132025|journal=The Journal of Japanese Studies|volume= 4| issue =  2|pages= 225–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Japan's progressive tax system also resulted in the [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistribution]] effect of personal income tax. The Japanese tax system was characterized by a high tax threshold and a steep increase in tax progressivity, creating high tax rate for high-income classes and low tax rate for low-income classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dewit|first=Andrew|date=2002|title=The Political Economy of Taxes and Redistribution in Japan|url=|journal=Social Science Japan Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, Japan's social security system also contributed to income redistribution effect. In 1961, Japan had established a comprehensive social security system - "national health insurance and pension schemes", when all Japanese people were finally covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Development of Social Policy in Japan."

== History ==
SAT was founded in [[Madonna di Campiglio]] on September 2, 1872 under the name of Alpine Society of [[Trentino]]. The founding members intended to promote the knowledge of the Trentino mountains, the tourist development of the valleys and the Italianity of Trentino. The means to pursue these goals were: the construction of huts, the creation of paths, the financing of hoteliers, the organization of mountain guides, climbing of peaks and the publication of geographic and mountaineering writings.

First president was [[Prospero Marchetti]] ([[Bolbeno]] 1822 - Arch 1884), vice president [[Nepomuceno Bolognini]] ([[Pinzolo]] , 24 March 1823 - [[Milan]], 18 July 1900). The members were summoned twice a year in a spring meeting and in at summer &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The congresses''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; during which the mountaineering, geographic, naturalistic and historical reports were presented and the progress of the association was measured. The first congress took place in Madonna di Campiglioin 1872, in 1994 it was celebrated in [[Trento]].

It should be noted that the SAT was not a group of mountaineers and hikers, but of a group of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] irredentists who wanted to implement "cultural appropriation and the acquisition of material possession of the homeland". In fact, in 1874 the society was dissolved by the Austrian authorities for filo-Italian activities. Then, in 1877, it was renamed to Società degli Alpinisti Tridentini (''Tridentini mountaineering company'').

The nationalist character of the SAT led to the so-called refuge war, a clash in the mountain toponomastics, between the unaltered flags hidden on the peaks, and the constructions of "double" shelters built alongside each other. For example, during the inauguration of the [[Quintino Sella Hut (Mont Blanc)|Quintino Sella hut]] in 1906, the participants could observe the yard of the German competitor [[Rifugio Tuckett]]. But shortly afterwards the great war broke out and the SAT was dissolved again. Many of its militants were interned or forced to confine, others took refuge in [[Italy]].

In 1920 SAT became a section of the [[Club Alpino Italiano|Italian Alpine Club]] (CAI), maintaining autonomy. On January 7, 1921, the working subsection of SOSAT, a working group climber at the initiative of Nino Peterlongo, was formed, which in 1919 in Trento had founded a section of the Unione operai escursionisti italiani (''Union of Workers Italian Walkers'').

In 2012 SAT had over 27,000 members, divided into 82 sections and 10 groups. It has 34 shelters, 12 [[Bivouac shelter|bivouacs]] and various support points and social huts, cares for the signage and maintenance of over 6,000 km of trails; Its alpine relief, founded in 1952, has 800 volunteers divided into 37 stations spread across the provincial territory with a cyanophilic and speleological unit.

The headquarters of the association is located in [[Trento]] in the palace Saracini-Cresseri (XVI century), which houses; The SAT museum, The historical archive, The SAT mountain library, The SAT section of Trento, The SUSAT (University Section), The SAT Chorus, The Provincial College of the Alpine Guides, The SAT Rock Cluster and the Giorgio Graffer Mountaineering and Mountaineering School.

SAT operates voluntarily in the [[Dolomites]] and the mountains of [[Trentino]].

'''''The Ethical Slut: A Guide to Infinite Sexual Possibilities''''' is an English [[non-fiction]] book by [[Dossie Easton]] and [[Janet Hardy]] (given as pseudonym Catherine A. Liszt for the book's first edition in 1997).

==Content==
The authors define the term ''[[slut]]'' as "a person of any [[gender]] who has the courage to lead life according to the radical proposition that [[sex]] is nice and [[pleasure]] is good for you." The term is [[reclaiming|reclaimed]] from its usual use as a [[pejorative]] and as a simple label for a [[promiscuous]] person. Instead, it is used to signify a person who is accepting of their enjoyment of [[sex]] and the [[pleasure]] of physical [[intimacy]] with others, and chooses to engage and accept these in an ethical and open way—rather than as [[cheating]].

''The Ethical Slut'' discusses how to live an active life with multiple concurrent sexual relationships in a fair and honest way. Discussion topics include how to deal with the practical difficulties and opportunities in finding and keeping partners, maintaining relationships with others, and strategies for personal growth.

It contains chapters discussing how consensual non-monogamy is handled in different [[subcultures]] such as the [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] communities, information on handling scheduling, [[jealousy]], communication, conflict in relationships, and [[etiquette]] for [[group sex]]ual encounters.

==Adaptation==
An article in the January 31, 2007, issue of the ''[[East Bay Express]]'' reports that Moses Ma will be producing a movie adaptation of ''The Ethical Slut''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/2007-01-31/culture/sluts-and-pork-buns/|title=Sluts and Pork Buns|last=Rufus|first=Anneli|date=31 January 2007|website=eastbayexpress.com|publisher=East Bay Express|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017143117/http://eastbayexpress.com/2007-01-31/culture/sluts-and-pork-buns/|archive-date=17 October 2007|dead-url=yes|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, that project had not come to fruition.

In 2013, Ben Fritz (producer/director) raised funding privately and via Kickstarter to create an episodic [[web series]] inspired by the book with input from Easton and Hardy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1140659809/ethical-slut|title=Ethical Slut|last=Fritz|first=Ben|date=9 May 2013|website=Kickstarter.com|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2014, three seasons of ''The Ethical Slut,'' were released on YouTube&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHL0tVF5VPueX1Oc6KXtpzA/videos|title=The Ethical Slut YouTube|last=Fritz|first=Ben|date=5 February 2014|website=youtube.com|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite struggles for funding during the second and third seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1140659809/the-ethical-slut-season-2and3|title=The Ethical Slut, Season 2&amp;3|last=Fritz|first=Ben|date=8 May 2014|website=Kickstarter.com|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gofundme.com/dnitjo|title=The Ethical Slut GoFund Me|last=Fritz|first=Ben|date=27 August 2014|website=GoFundMe|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 38 episodes, ranging between 4 and 9 minutes.  The series follows two female friends as they decide to explore open relationships with the aid of the helpful handbook, ''The Ethical Slut''.

Co-author Dossie Easton reported in May 2007 that Easton and Liszt were working on a second edition of the book, including more communication exercises and information about [[polyamory]] communities on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, Dossie. Interview. "[http://media.libsyn.com/media/polyweekly/PW110.5_23_07.mp3 Episode 110]". ''[http://www.polyweekly.com/ Polyamory Weekly]''. By Cunning Minx. May 24, 2007. Quoted in "[http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/2007/05/upcoming-poly-books-and-movie.html Upcoming Poly Books and Movie]". ''[http://www.polyinthemedia.blogspot.com/ Polyamory in the News]''. May 25, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; It was published in March 2009 and is called ''The Ethical Slut: A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships &amp; Other Adventures''.
A third edition was released in August 2017 entitled ''The Ethical Slut, Third Edition: A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships, and Other Freedoms in Sex and Love''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ethical Slut, Third Edition: Penguin Random House|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/553912/the-ethical-slut-third-edition-by-janet-w-hardy-and-dossie-easton/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third edition has been revised to include interviews with poly millennials (young people who have grown up without the prejudices their elders encountered regarding gender, orientation, sexuality, and relationships), tributes to poly pioneers, and new sidebars on topics such as asexuality, sex workers, and ways polys can connect and thrive. The authors also include new content addressing nontraditional relationships beyond the polyamorous paradigm of "more than two": couples who don't live together, couples who don't have sex with each other, nonparallel arrangements, couples with widely divergent sex styles, power disparities, and cross-orientation relationships, while utilizing non-binary gender language and new terms that have come into common usage since the last edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-ethical-slut-third-edition-janet-w-hardy/1125362419|title=The Ethical Slut, Third Edition: A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships, and Other Freedoms in Sex and Love|last=Noble|first=Barnes &amp;|website=Barnes &amp; Noble|language=en|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vietnamese people''' ({{lang-bg|виетнамци}}, ''vietnamtsi'') form the small immigrant community of [[Overseas Vietnamese]] '''in Bulgaria''' today, but their numbers were much higher in the 1980s. As of 2015, the Vietnamese community in [[Bulgaria]] numbers 2,600, including Bulgarian [[Bulgarian nationality law|residents and/or citizens]]. They mainly live in the capital [[Sofia]], but also in [[Plovdiv]], [[Dimitrovgrad, Bulgaria|Dimitrovgrad]] and [[Varna]] .&lt;ref name=imir/&gt;
Many Vietnamese people also live in [[Kozloduy]].

==History==
The Vietnamese diaspora in Bulgaria dates to the 1960s. In 1950, Bulgaria and Vietnam had established [[diplomatic relations]] and signed a mutual agreement to co-operate in cultural and educational affairs. As a result, the first Vietnamese students arrived in Bulgaria in 1960. The main subjects that the Vietnamese came to study were [[agriculture]], [[economics]], [[tourism]], [[humanities]], [[arts]], [[medicine]] and [[construction]].&lt;ref name=imir/&gt;

According to an international agreement of 1980, Bulgaria, along with other [[Comecon]] members such as [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], accepted [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] [[foreign worker|guest workers]] in the country as a relatively cheaper [[manual labour]] [[workforce]]. According to one estimate, over 35,000 Vietnamese people have worked in Bulgaria between 1980 and 1991, and 5,000 Vietnamese students have completed their higher education in various [[List of universities in Bulgaria|Bulgarian universities]].&lt;ref name=sega&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.segabg.com/online/article.asp?issueid=2959&amp;sectionid=5&amp;id=0001001 |title=Виетнамците идат{{mdash}} помним ли ги? |language=Bulgarian |publisher=Сега |date=2008-04-21 |last=Терзиев |first=Светослав |accessdate=2008-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719053155/http://www.segabg.com/online/article.asp?issueid=2959&amp;sectionid=5&amp;id=0001001 |archive-date=2011-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plattenbau]]ten (панелка; ''panelka'') and [[mobile home]] [[hostel]]s were built in 1984 in the [[Krasna polyana]] municipality of Sofia to accommodate the Vietnamese; by 1990, the area had acquired the nickname "[[Little Saigon]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Evolution in Europe; Vietnamese in Bulgaria: Bitter Times |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D9113CF932A3575BC0A966958260 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=1990-08-01 |last=Sudetic |first=Chuck |accessdate=2008-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hostels are still known as "the Vietnamese hostels" today, although their demolition has been considered by the Capital Municipality as they have since [[Urban decay|decayed]] into an unregulated [[Roma in Bulgaria|Roma]]-inhabited [[slum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zagrada.bg/show.php?storyid=488545&amp;show=0 |title=Общината обмисля да събори Виетнамските общежития |publisher=zaGrada.bg |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=2008-08-31 |last=Антонова |first=Анелия }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was to compensate Bulgaria's lack of sufficient manual workforce and at the same time to relieve [[Vietnam]] of some of its growing population, with the trained workers potentially coming back. In practice, however, this co-operation was subject to much corruption in Vietnam, with many members of its richest class of merchants paying bribes equivalent to around [[euro|€]]1,000 (in 1985) to be sent to Bulgaria, where they expanded their speculative business, engaging in [[black market]] trade, production of [[counterfeit]] goods such as [[jeans]], etc. As a consequence, shortly after the democratic changes of 1989, Bulgaria arranged the accelerated return of most of the Vietnamese workers to Vietnam, effective in 1991.&lt;ref name=sega/&gt;

Of the thousands of Vietnamese, all but the students and those who had married in Bulgaria left. Since 1991, Bulgaria has been a target country for economic immigrants from Vietnam,&lt;ref name=imir/&gt; as the average wages remained higher despite the country's difficulties in the 1990s. Along with the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Koreans]], [[Arabs]] and other immigrants, the Vietnamese have established a presence among the vendors in Sofia's well-known and frequented [[bazaar]] Iliyantsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zagrada.bg/show.php?storyid=308493 |title=Евробитак "Илиянци" |publisher=zaGrada.bg |date=2007-02-01 |last=Шентов |first=Иван |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=2008-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Vietnamese immigrants is constantly rising, although they are yet to feature more prominently in Bulgaria's social life and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bghelsinki.org/obektiv/2006/130/130-11.pdf |title=Черно на бяло за "невидимите малцинства" |last=Недева |first=Ирина |publisher=[[Helsinki Committee for Human Rights|Български хелзинкски комитет]] |accessdate=2008-08-31 |language=Bulgarian }} [http://www.bghelsinki.org/index.php?module=pages&amp;lg=bg&amp;page=obektiv13011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, it was widely reported and discussed that Bulgaria, now a [[European Union]] member, is again looking to employ Vietnamese workers, as [[unemployment]] in the country has been largely solved as an issue (with [[List of countries by unemployment rate|unemployment rates]] comparable to those in [[France]] or [[Belgium]] and lower than in [[Spain]] or [[Germany]]). and on the contrary, there is a lack of workers in the rapidly developing building and [[tourism in Bulgaria|tourism]] branches in particular.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6137">'''William E. Hurwitz''', M.D., was a [[Virginia]] based [[pain management]] physician who was prosecuted and convicted by the [[United States Government]] in 2004 for excessively prescribing addictive [[opioid]] pain medication to patients, some of whom subsequently abused and redistributed their medications on the black market.  Before his conviction,  Hurwitz had had a series of running battles with the Virginia Board of Medicine which, in 2003 found fault with some of his prescriptions but also held that all were written "in good faith".

William E. Hurwitz is a graduate of Columbia College. He then spent a period at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education|Harvard University School of Education]] before attending [[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford University's Medical School]].  While at Stanford he also earned a Masters in Sociology.  He served as a staff physician in [[Brazil]] with the [[Peace Corps]] upon completing his medical degree.

==Conviction in first trial==
In 2004, Hurwitz was convicted of over 50 counts of distribution of narcotics originally sentenced to four 25-year sentences and forty-six 15-year sentences, all of which were to be served concurrently, and was fined $2 million (U.S.). During the prosecution of the first case, all of Hurwitz's property was seized.

Hurwitz maintains that he was duped by his patients, and that the enforcement tactics being applied in the [[War on Drugs]] unfairly target law-abiding doctors, leading to a situation where doctors must choose between providing compassionate care and accepting personal liability for what their patients do with prescribed medications.

His case has potentially serious ramifications among all practitioners of [[pain medicine]], and is considered by many to be a drastic example of the overreach of anti-drug law enforcement efforts.&lt;ref name="tierney"&gt;Tierney, John. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/science/27tier.html?ex=1177560000&amp;en=5b5b33d313ff8f11&amp;ei=5070 Trafficker or Healer? And Who’s the Victim?]", The [[New York Times]], published March 27, 2007, accessed April 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction overturned on appeal==
His conviction was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on August 22, 2006, due to errors by the trial judge that essentially prevented the jury from considering Hurwitz's defense—that he was prescribing the medication in good faith as part of the regular practice of medicine.  His re-trial began on March 26, 2007 in federal district court for the Eastern District of Virginia.  Hurwitz's entire defense team—including four expert witnesses and every attorney—worked on the matter ''pro bono'', i.e. for free.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Conviction in second trial==
On April 27, 2007 jurors found William E. Hurwitz guilty of 16 counts of drug trafficking and determined that he prescribed massive quantities of medicine to patients in chronic pain. The 12-member jury acquitted Hurwitz on 17 other trafficking counts. District Judge Leonie Brinkema dismissed the remaining 12 counts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/27/AR2007042702204.html |title=Pain Doctor Is Guilty of Drug Trafficking |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= April 28, 2007|accessdate=2012-08-03 |first=Jerry |last=Markon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His two lead trial attorneys for the second trial were Lawrence Robbins and Richard Sauber, of Robbins, Russell, Englert, Orseck &amp; Untereiner, and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, respectively.

On July 13, 2007 Judge Brinkema sentenced Hurwitz to four years and nine months. The judge said that most of Hurwitz's practice was legitimate medicine that saved patients' lives and that medical literature increasingly supports his theories on the propriety of massive drug doses to treat patients in chronic pain. "An increasing body of respectable medical literature and expertise supports those types of high-dosage, opioid medications," the judge said. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/13/AR2007071301035.html |title=Va. Pain Doctor's Prison Term Is Cut to 57 Months |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= July 14, 2007|accessdate=2012-08-03 |first=Jerry |last=Markon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge added that Hurwitz had undermined his own cause by ignoring that some patients were clearly drug dealers and Hurwitz admitted before sentencing that he had deceived himself about some patients who in retrospect were clearly criminals. 

Since Hurwitz has already spent over 2-1/2 years in prison his lawyers believe he will be eligible for release in about 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/13/america/NA-GEN-US-Pain-Doctor-Trial.php |title=Search - Global Edition - The New York Times |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30476">The National Park System preserves and interprets the history of women in American society.  Many national parks, monuments and historic sites represent America's women's history as a primary theme, while numerous others address American women's history somewhere in their programs and preservation activities. The lists of sites below is not exhaustive, but includes sites closely related to themes in U.S. Women's History. Click here for an article on [[Women in the National Park Service]].

==Park units==
* [[Adams National Historical Park]], Quincy, Massachusetts. The site interprets the lives of Abigail Smith Adams (1744 - 1818) and Louisa Catherine Adams (1775 - 1852)
* [[Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument]] - Dedicated a national monument by President [[Barack Obama]] on April 12, 2016, the Sewall-Belmont House in Washington D.C. has been home to the [[National Woman's Party]] since 1929. Here, suffragist [[Alice Paul]] and the NWP developed innovative strategies and tactics to advocate for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] and equality for women.
* [[Clara Barton National Historic Site]] Glen Echo, [[Washington, D.C.]] - [[Clara Barton]] moved into her Glen Echo home February 28, 1897.  Vacating the property rented in Washington, D.C. since 1892 (at 17th &amp; F Streets NW) required packing and transporting over 30 wagon loads of supplies.  Barton founded the [[American Red Cross]] from her residence in Dansville, New York; her home in Glen Echo, Maryland, also housed the American Red Cross.
* [[Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site]] (Hyde Park, New York).  Roosevelt's home at Val-Kil interprets Roosevelt's work as a wife, mother, reformer, columnist, and lecturer. Born in 1884, Roosevelt spent her early summers in the Hudson Valley and married Franklin Roosevelt in 1905. After his death in 1945, Roosevelt was appointed to the United States delegation to the United Nations, where she worked on the Human Rights Commission of the U.N. Economic and Social Council and spearheaded the writing and passing of the Declaration of Human Rights. Vigorously promoting the humanitarian causes so close to her heart, Roosevelt earned the title - in the words of President [[Harry S. Truman]] - "First Lady of the World." the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site also interprets the history of Val-Kill Industries, which Roosevelt established to help rural residents secure extra income by reproducing Early American furniture.
* [[Everglades National Park]] (Florida) - These opening words from Marjory Stoneman Douglas' immortal book "Everglades: River of Grass" crystallize the uniqueness of the Everglades. Douglas' book, The Everglades: River of Grass, published in 1947—the year Everglades National Park was established—has become the definitive description of the natural treasure she fought so hard to protect. After several reprints, the revised edition was published in 1987, to draw attention to the continuing threats—unresolved—to "her river."
* [https://www.nps.gov/hatu/index.htm Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park] - The world's best known conductor of the [[Underground Railroad]], [[Harriet Tubman]] was an [[abolitionist]], [[suffragist]], activist, and freedom fighter. This site preservers the landscape that would have been familiar to Tubman as an enslaved child, young woman, and freedom seeker on Maryland's Eastern Shore. The new visitor center is due to open in March 2017.
*[[Kate Mullany House]] (Troy, New York).  The home of labor activist Kate Mullany (1845–1906), founder, in February 1864, of the all-women Collar Laundry Union in Troy, New York, one of the earliest women's labor unions.
*[[Keweenaw National Historical Park]] (Calumet, Michigan). This [[Keweenaw National Historical Park|park]], established to preserve and interpret the story of the rise and decline of Michigan's copper mining industry, also tells the story of the women who contributed to the success of the mining communities.
*[[Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site]] Interprets the lives of the Northern Plains Indians on the Upper Missouri over thousands of years.  Ancestors of today's Hidatsa, Mandan, and Arikara tribes occupied earthlodge communities; these matrilineal societies hunted bison, cultivated crops, and participated in trade.
* [[First Ladies National Historic Site]] (Canton, Ohio). Authorized by Congress on October 11, 2000, the site preserves the home of First Lady Ida Saxton McKinley as well as the seven story 1895 City Bank Building. It is also the home of the [http://www.firstladies.org/libraryobjective.aspx National First Ladies' Library].
* [[Johnstown Flood National Memorial]] ([[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]]) The life of Clara Barton, the most recognized women of the fledgling American Red Cross, is one of the interpretive themes for Johnstown Flood National Memorial.  Barton and the Red Cross played a role in the relief effort but many people and organizations were involved in the successful efforts in rebuild Johnstown.

The role of '''women in [[Turkmenistan]]''' has never conformed to Western stereotypes about [[Women in Islam|Muslim women]].&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{Country study|country=Turkmenistan|abbr=tm|section=Social structure|date=March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a division of labor exists and women usually are not visible actors in political affairs outside the home, Turkmen women have never [[Hijab|worn a veil]] similar to that of the women of some of its neighboring countries.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; As Turkmenistan is a tribal nation, customs regarding women can vary within the country: for example, women in the eastern part of the country are permitted to drink some alcohol whereas women who live in the central portion of the country, particularly those of the Tekke tribe, are not permitted to imbibe alcohol.  Most women possess a host of highly specialized skills and crafts, especially those connected with the household and its maintenance.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, women assumed responsibility for the observance of some Muslim rites to protect their husbands' careers.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; Many women entered the work force out of economic necessity, a factor that disrupted some traditional family practices and increased the incidence of [[divorce]].&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; At the same time, educated urban women entered professional services and careers.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

==Background==

[[File:Turkmenistan_on_the_globe_(Eurasia_centered).svg|thumb|150 px|right|Turkmenistan on the map]]
Turkmenistan is a country in [[Central Asia]]. Throughout the centuries, the territory of present-day Turkmenistan has been subjected to numerous civilizations, such as Persian empires, the conquest of Alexander the Great, Muslims, Mongols, Turkic peoples, and Russians. Throughout most of the 20th century it was part of the Soviet Union, until its fall in 1991. As with other former Soviet states, in the 1990s the economy collapsed and the country experienced social problems. Today, Turkmenistan is about half urban and half rural; its population is largely Muslim (89%), but there is also a significant Eastern Orthodox minority.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tx.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[total fertility rate]] is 2.09 children born/woman (2015 est.).&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;

== Cultural significance of women in Turkmenistan ==
Cooking is the main field of work for women in an independent area. Some households have a small room for making food and keeping utensils. Neighbors or relatives sometimes arrive unasked to assist in housework, or they may bring their own household tasks to work on together and socialize. Food preparation is done in the open air. Tasks, such as smoking meat and popping corn, are done by men and often turn into a social opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Genté, Régis. “Second-class citizens.” 17 June 2013. ''Chronicles of Turkmenistan.'' Web. 30 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are expected to maintain a distance in regards to gender. Men and women might sit and eat in one place, but they are segregated during social occasions. Some women carry on the practice of wearing a [[Headscarf|yaşmak]],head scarf, in the initial year after they are wed. The wife clenches the corner of her scarf in her teeth to show a significant barrier toward the male guests and to show respect to her parents-in-law. The scarf also stops her from communicating. The wife may stop covering her head with a yaşmak after a year of her wedding, after the birth of her first born,or by a decision within the family.&lt;ref&gt;Countries and their Cultures. “TÜrkmenistan.” 2015.

== Female population of Turkmenistan ==
The total population of Turkmenistan constitutes the figure of 5,171,943 (July 2014 est.), with a total sex ratio among the total population: 0.98 male(s)/female (2014 est.).&lt;ref&gt;Index Mundi. “Turkmenistan Demographics Profile 2014.” 30 June 2015. ''Index Mundi.'' Web. 30 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The bright attire of women ==
Turkmens are an attention-grabbing people, and this is especially true of the women. Women are garbed in ankle-length garments of silk or velvet, which are commonly a mix of bright oranges, purples, yellows, blues, and greens. The necklines are embellished with elaborate gold-thread needlework that drops down, decorating the neckline right to the navel.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Shaun. “Turkmenistan: Stranger in a very strange land.” 23 October 2011. ''Independent.co.uk.'' Web. 30 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Richly decorated head wear, jewelry and embroidery accents are a part of their routine.&lt;ref name="Central Asia Cultures 2014"&gt;Central Asia Cultures. “Enjoy Fascinating Cultures of the Silk Road.” 2014. ''Central Asia Cultures.'' Web. 30 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Home-spun silk by Turkmen women ==
Even in the present, [[Spinning (textiles)|ketene]], a homespun silk, manufacturing persists largely as a cottage skill. These works, like other handmade artistries, are enormously painstaking and consume a lot of hard work.

The women of Turkmenistan are highly talented and hardworking, thus becoming the makers of ketene. It helps to make the fine-looking clothes for the Turkmen women at distinctive events. The embroidery on the garments reveal various patterns that are exclusively known as a family hallmark, distinguishing the family of its maker.&lt;ref name="Central Asia Cultures 2014"/&gt;

Skilled Turkmen women use antique weaving looms known as tara, which were adopted in the ancient times. These succeed in high eminence, with a startling amount of precision on embellished fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Traveler.uz. “Turkmen Silk.” 2008. ''Traveler.uz.'' Web. 30 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The locals have been weaving beautiful patterns for hundreds of years. The garments prepared from keteni have been worn by both men and women. Since men's style was restricted mostly to shirts, ladies gathered a whole apparel of costumes and head scarves. The attractive costumes prepared from keteni still persist as a customary bridal dress (Central Asia Cultures).&lt;ref name="Central Asia Cultures 2014"/&gt;

== The status of women in Turkmenistan ==
The element that has transformed the role of women from homemaker to basic breadwinner of the family is a revolution that Turkmen civilization has gone through. This was the aftermath of a plan followed by the government, which caused a change in nationwide values and social principles.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Glenn E. “Social Structure.” 1996. ''Countrystudies.us.'' Web. 30 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; After splitting from [[Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]], several initiatives, organizations and establishments became insolvent in Turkmenistan which caused a severe upsurge in joblessness.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia.com. “Turkmenistan.” 2007. ''Encyclopedia.com.'' Web. 30 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Men, being the main providers of the family, imported items of use and food to sell in the local market. However, this was discouraged by the border patrol agents and police officers. This is when the women became the earners. However, in the beginning of the 90s, thanks to the social approach, the officers did not confront, examine or offend women. Subsequently, women became involved in the most accepted kind of private enterprise – trading in products from overseas.&lt;ref name="Turkmenistan. 2015"&gt;Chronicles of Turkmenistan. “Almanac “Women in Turkmenistan”.” 28 June 2015. ''Chronicles of Turkmenistan.'' Web. 30 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Serious gender imbalance occurred ==
Since men were left with no opportunity to find employment in their own country, many men left the country in the hunt of work. They mainly traveled to Turkey, Russia, and United Arab Emirates. This also led the nation toward drug addiction, which flourished in the 90s, and caused a substantial reduction in the male population of the country able to provide for their families. These circumstances caused a severe gender disparity, which created a challenge for women to have a family. Some settled to live as the second or third spouses of prosperous men or to bear children outside of marriage.&lt;ref name="Turkmenistan. 2015"/&gt;

== Measures to enhance gender empowerment ==
The [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] reveals the amount to which Turkmen women play an energetic role in the financial and governmental domain. It emphasizes women’s financial participation and managerial ability, determining the gender inequalities in the political commercial scopes of activity.&lt;ref&gt;Economic Commission For Europe. “Turkmenistan: Development Of Gender Statistics In Turkmenistan.” Joint ECE/UNDP Workshop on Gender Statistics for Policy Monitoring and Benchmarking. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
