'''Abu al-Fadl Abdullah bin Muhammad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari''' (1910&amp;ndash;1993) was a Moroccan preacher, jurist and theologian.&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Shah, ''The Hạdīth: Scholarship, perspectives, and criticism'', Routledge, 2010, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lineage==
The Ghumari family descends from [[Ahl al-Bayt]], the family of the Islamic [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]] [[Muhammad]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Ghumari's bloodline is traced through his father Muhammad, son of Muhammad, son of Ahmad, son of Muhammad, son of Qasim, son of Muhammad, son of Muhammad, son of Abd al-Mu`min, son of Muhammad, son of Abd al-Mu`min, son of Ali, son of al-Hasan, son of Muhammad, son of Abdullah, son of Ahmad, son of Abdullah, son of Isa, son of Mas'ud, son of al-Fudayl, son of [[Ali ibn Umar]], son of Umar, son of al-Arabi Alal, son of Musa, son of Ahmad, son of Dawud, son of [[Idris II of Fes]], son of [[Idris I of Morocco]], son of Abdullah, son of al-Hasan al-Muthana, son of [[Hasan ibn Ali]], son of [[Ali]] and [[Fatimah]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Life==
Ghumari was born in the Moroccan city of [[Tangier]] in 1910, and died in the same city in 1993.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;The Biography of Abu al Fadl Abdullah bin as-Siddiq al-Ghumari who died in the year 1413AH, written and translated by Riad Nachef. Available at:&lt;br&gt;*[http://www.ayouby.com/biography/english-translations/623-sheikh-abdullah-bin-as-siddiq-al-ghumari-.html Ayouby.com]&lt;br&gt;*[http://www.riadnachef.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=113:the-biogaphy-of-abu-alfadl-abdullah-bin-as-siddiq-al-ghumari-&amp;catid=56:english-text&amp;Itemid=77 Riad Nachef, Islamic Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he was primarily educated by his father Muhammad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari, also an Islamic scholar. The younger Ghumari [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized]] the entirety of the [[Qur'an]] at an early age, in addition to the [[Hadith]] book [[Bulugh al-Maram]] along with [[Alfiya]] and [[Ajārūmīya]] in [[Arabic grammar]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Ghumari later travelled to [[Fes|Fas]] for his higher education, but then enrolled in the [[University of al-Karaouine]]. While there, he also studied [[Mosque of Uqba]],&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] and important seat of Muslim religious learning.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pc_item.php?id=monument%3BISL%3Btn%3BMon01%3B2%3Ben Great Mosque of Kairouan (discoverislamicart.org)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407201059/http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pc_item.php?id=monument%3BISL%3Btn%3BMon01%3B2%3Ben |date=2013-04-07 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; During his study, Ghumari's teachers covered a number of books considered canonical in Sunni Islam, [[Al-Qastallani]]'s explanation of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and the works of [[Khalil ibn Ishaq al-Jundi]] being two examples.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Eventually, Ghumari switched from Karaouine to [[Al-Azhar University]] in 1930 and graduating the next year. During his education, Ghumari was a student of [[Al-Kawthari]], of whom Ghumari would later hold extremely negative views.&lt;ref name=haddad&gt;[[Gibril Haddad]], [http://www.abc.se/home/m9783/ir/f/The%20Ghumari%20School.htm The Ghumari School]. 6 December 2002: Living Islam. Last updated 2 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to fears in the wider [[Arab world]] regarding the influence of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in the mid-twentieth century, Ghumari was accused of having ties to a foreign group.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} In 1961, he was sentenced to ten years in prison, likely due to his time spent in Egypt where the Brotherhood had formed. Hi{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}s older brother, [[Ahmad al-Ghumari]], fell ill upon hearing of his younger brother's long sentence and died eight months later.

==Career==
Like most of the Ghumari family, Abdullah al-Ghumari was a prolific writer. 

Ghumari was famous not only for the number of teachers which he had, but also the number of students. [[Salâh Ud Dîn At Tijânî]] and [[Muhammad bin Yahya al-Ninowy]] is counted as one of Ghumari's more prominent students,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alburujpress.com/teachers/teacher/50/ Shaykh Muhammad Bin Yahya An-Ninowy]. 2009: Al Buruj Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130216221958/http://www.thedeeninstitute.com/about-us/our-team/item/75-shaykh-muhammad-al-ninowy-senior-instructor Shaykh Muhammad al-Ninowy: Senior Instructor].

The '''Aberdeen Scandal''' was a military [[sexual assault]] scandal in 1996 at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], a [[United States Army]] base in [[Maryland]].

Ultimately, twelve [[drill instructors]] were charged with sex crimes; four were sentenced to prison, while eight others were discharged or received [[non-judicial punishment]].&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;Steve Vogel, [http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/14/news/mn-29893 Scandal-Scarred Army Busts Drill Sergeant in Sex-Crime Clampdown], ''Washington Post'' (May 14, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, "letters of reprimand were issued to Aberdeen's [[commanding officer|commanding]] general and three other senior officers."&lt;ref name="Vogel"/&gt;

==Charges brought against the officers==
[[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] Derrick Robertson and [[Staff Sergeant|Sergeants]] Delmar Simpson and Nathanael Beech were accused of participating in the army's biggest sex abuse scandal on record. Robertson and Simpson faced [[rape]] charges and Beech was charged with [[adultery]].&lt;ref name="http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/06/aberdeen.arraign/index.html"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/06/aberdeen.arraign/index.html Three soldiers arraigned in U.S. Army sex scandal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Army Secretary [[Togo West]] accused those charged of abusing their power, and ordered all soldiers to undergo [[sexual harassment]] training so they could learn the army's "[[zero tolerance]]" policy towards sexual harassment.

The men accused felt that statements made by West and other officials within the army were prejudging the case and would result in an unfair trial. Robertson's attorney, Jerome Murphy, asked the judge, Military [[Judge]] Linda Webster, to enact a [[gag order]] on West and others, but she deferred judgment. However, she did order prospective jurors not to follow media coverage of the case to avoid interference with their judgment.&lt;ref name="http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/06/aberdeen.arraign/index.html"/&gt;

==Individuals involved and outcomes==
*Sergeant Delmar Simpson was held at the [[Marine Corps Brig, Quantico]] while his court-martial was pending.&lt;ref name="RuaneCharged"/&gt; He was convicted of 18 counts of rape and 29 other offenses, and was sentenced to 25 years in military prison.&lt;ref name="ClinesSentencing"/&gt;
*Staff Sergeant Vernell Robinson Jr., "was convicted of 19 counts involving the abuse of five women under his command," including [[sodomy]], [[adultery]], communicating a threat, [[Obstruction of justice|obstructing justice]] and disobeying orders.&lt;ref name="ClinesSentencing"&gt;Francis X.

*Sergeant 1st Class William Jones,&lt;ref name="PriestSpinner"/&gt; a drill instructor assigned to B Company of the 16th Ordnance Battalion, was charged with one count of indecent assault involving an ex-trainee (a civilian at the time of the alleged offense), one count of drunkenness on duty, and "seven counts of fraternizing with recruits that involve six female trainees."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Bowman, [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-01-29/news/1997029106_1_aberdeen-drill-sergeant-court-martial 5th Aberdeen instructor faces court-martial Drill sergeant charged with indecent assault], ''Baltimore Sun'' (January 29, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Army ultimately dropped the charges, choosing to pursue discharge proceedings instead.&lt;ref&gt;David Dishneau, [http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1997/Aberdeen-Sex-Scandal-Nearly-Over/id-65c5a271b36213102a889bbed5d962cb Aberdeen Sex Scandal Nearly Over], Associated Press (November 7, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sergeant 1st Class Theron Brown, an instructor, was "charged with violation of a general order, sodomy, adultery, making a false statement and disobeying a superior's order" in connection with incidents involving two female trainees and one female civilian.&lt;ref name="PriestSpinner"/&gt; Brown was discharged from the service in lieu of court-martial.&lt;ref name="PriestSpinner"/&gt;
*Sergeant Nathanael C. Beach, another drill instructor, was charged with "violation of a superior's order, failing to obey a general order, making a false official statement, adultery, communicating a threat and fraternization with a female soldier" for incidents involving two female soldiers.&lt;ref name="PriestSpinner"/&gt; Beach was accused by a trainee "of having sex with her and threatening to kill her if she didn't keep quiet."&lt;ref name="SomeCleared"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/US/9702/20/army.sex.scandal/ Some accused in Army sex scandal are cleared], CNN (February 20, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Charges were dropped against Beach, who faced administrative discipline rather than court-martial.&lt;ref name="SomeCleared"/&gt;
*Sergeant Isiah Chestnut was initially charged with a variety of offenses, involving four female trainees,&lt;ref name="PriestSpinner"/&gt; but the Army decided not to pursue a court-martial, choosing Article 15 non-judicial punishment instead.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Respers, [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-02-20/news/1997051023_1_aberdeen-bleckley-susan-gibson Aberdeen soldier won't face court-martial in sex scandal], ''Baltimore Sun'' (February 20, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Chestnut was ultimately permitted to resign in lieu of facing court-martial.&lt;ref name="SomeCleared"/&gt;
*Sergeant 1st Class Ronald Moffett "was charged with indecent assault, indecent language, adultery, cruelty and maltreatment, and violating an order prohibiting social relationships with trainees" in a case involving four female soldiers.&lt;ref name="Aug19Demotion"/&gt; Moffett agreed to be discharged in lieu of court-martial.&lt;ref name="Aug19Demotion"/&gt;

* Major General John E. Longhouser, the commanding general of Aberdeen Proving Ground, was allowed to take early retirement in 1997 after it was revealed that he had "an adulterous affair with a civilian woman while separated from his wife."&lt;ref name="Rochelle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shenon"&gt;Philip Shenon, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/us/commander-at-aberdeen-to-retire-over-an-affair.html Commander at Aberdeen To Retire Over an Affair], ''New York Times'' (June 3, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; The events occurred more than five years before Longhouser's retirement, and before his arrival at Aberdeen.&lt;ref name="Shenon"/&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', Pentagon officials stated that Longhouser "appeared to be retiring partly out of disgust that his entire career would be judged on the basis of what he and others would regard as a minor dalliance."&lt;ref name="Shenon"/&gt;

==Fort Leonard Wood scandal==
A separate and unrelated scandal took place in 1996 at [[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]] in [[Missouri]]; charges in that case were announced five days before the Aberdeen scandal became public, and the two cases were reported by the media in tandem.&lt;ref name="Pine"&gt;Art Pine, [http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-13/news/mn-64249_1_army-base Sergeant at 2nd Army Base Admits to Sex With Recruits], ''Los Angeles Times'' (November 13, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SgtCleared"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-17/news/mn-9989_1_sexual-harassment Army Sergeant Is Cleared of All Charges of Sexual Abuse], Reuters (December 17, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Army officials, 22 female soldiers "were involved in incidents" in which three men&amp;mdash;Staff Sgt. Loren B. Taylor, Staff Sgt. Anthony S. Fore, and Sgt. George W. Blackley Jr.&amp;mdash;were charged.&lt;ref name="Pine"/&gt;

Taylor pleaded guilty to failing to obey a general regulation "by having consensual sex with three female recruits and trying to have sex with another" and admitted to "improper contact with a fifth woman recruit."&lt;ref name="Pine"/&gt; Taylor was "discharged, demoted and sentenced to confinement."&lt;ref name="TaylorSgt"&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/1996-12-13/news/25640693_1_indecent-assault-drill-sergeant-general-regulation Prison Term For Army Sergeant in Sex Case], ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' wire services (December 13, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Fore pleaded guilty to failing to obey a general regulation, indecent assault, and assault and battery, and a military judge, after hearing testimony, convicting Fore "of two additional counts of failing to obey a general regulation and indecent assault."&lt;ref name="TaylorSgt"/&gt; The Army dropped several other charges.&lt;ref name="TaylorSgt"/&gt; Fore sentenced to eighteen months in prison and was dishonorably discharged.&lt;ref name="TaylorSgt"/&gt;

Blackley was acquitted on charges of failing to obey a general regulation, indecent assault, maltreatment and showing disrespect to a fellow non-commissioned officer.&lt;ref name="SgtCleared"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Since the charges were filed, the U.S. Army set up a [[hotline]] to take reports of sexual harassment in the military. It has also made available many resources for soldiers who feel they have been harassed or assaulted.&lt;ref name="Calls still pouring in on Army harassment hot line"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/US/9611/17/military.sex/index.html Calls still pouring in on Army harassment hot line] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518162403/http://www.cnn.com/US/9611/17/military.sex/index.html |date=May 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supervisors were also barred from having romantic relationships with the soldiers they trained. The Army cited the fact that they cannot be sure if all relationships are consensual due to the nature of a supervisor's power over their trainees.&lt;ref name="Soldiers try to define sexual harassment"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/US/9611/18/army.sidebar/index.html Soldiers try to define sexual harassment]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Octopod by syntopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|"Octopod" by Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen. An example of algorithmic art produced with the software ''Structure Synth''.&lt;ref name=Hvidtfeldt&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hvidtfeldt Christensen |first1=Mikael |title=Hvitfeldts.net |url=http://hvidtfeldts.net/ |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Algorithmic art''', also known as ''algorithm art'', is art, mostly [[visual art]], of which the design is generated by an [[algorithm]]. Algorithmic artists are sometimes called '''algorists'''.

==Overview==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}
Algorithmic art, also known as [[computer-generated art]], is a subset of [[generative art]] (generated by an autonomous system) and is related to [[systems art]] (influenced by systems theory). [[Fractal art]] is an example of algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=UCSB&gt;{{cite web |title=Approximating Reality with Interactive Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~g.legrady/academic/courses/01sp200a/students/brentYokota/200a_fin.html |publisher=University of California Santa Barbara |accessdate=25 December 2015 |date=7 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an image of reasonable size, even the simplest [[algorithm]]s require too much calculation for manual execution to be practical, and they are thus executed on either a single computer or on a cluster of computers.  The final output is typically displayed on a [[computer monitor]], printed with a [[wikt:raster|raster]]-type printer, or drawn using a [[plotter]].  Variability can be introduced by using [[pseudo-random]] numbers.  There is no consensus as to whether the product of an algorithm that operates on an existing image (or on any input other than pseudo-random numbers) can still be considered computer-generated art, as opposed to computer-assisted art.&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Darb-i Imam shrine spandrel.JPG|thumb|left|[[Islamic geometric patterns]] such as this [[girih]] tiling in the [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine in [[Isfahan]], are precursors of algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;]]

[[Roman Verostko]] argues that [[Islamic geometric patterns]] are constructed using algorithms, as are [[Italian Renaissance]] paintings which make use of [[mathematics and art|mathematical techniques]], in particular [[linear perspective]] and proportion.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;

[[File:San Romano Battle (Paolo Uccello, London) 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--width for very low image--&gt;|[[Paolo Uccello]] made innovative use of a geometric algorithm, incorporating [[linear perspective]] in paintings such as ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' (c. 1435–1460): broken lances run along perspective lines.]]

Some of the earliest known examples of computer-generated algorithmic art were created by [[Georg Nees]], [[Frieder Nake]], [[A. Michael Noll]], [[Manfred Mohr]] and [[:fr:Vera Molnár|Vera Molnár]] in the early 1960s. These artworks were executed by a [[plotter]] controlled by a [[computer]], and were therefore computer-generated art but not [[digital art]]. The act of creation lay in writing the [[Computer program|program]], which specified the sequence of actions to be performed by the [[plotter]]. [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] established Generative Systems as a program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"&gt;Sonia Landy Sheridan, "Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 103-108. {{doi|10.2307/1574794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her early work with copier and telematic art focused on the differences between the human hand and the algorithm.&lt;ref name="MF1"&gt;Flanagan, Mary. "An Appreciation on the Impact of the work of Sonia Landy Sheridan." The Art of Sonia Landy Sheridan. Hanover, NH: [[Hood Museum of Art]], 2009, pp. 37–42.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Aside from the ongoing work of Roman Verostko and his fellow algorists, the next known examples are [[fractal art]]works created in the mid to late 1980s. These are important here because they use a different means of execution. Whereas the earliest algorithmic art was "drawn" by a [[plotter]], [[fractal art]] simply creates an image in [[computer memory]]; it is therefore [[digital art]]. The native form of a [[fractal art]]work is an image stored on a [[computer]]&amp;nbsp;–this is also true of very nearly all equation art and of most recent algorithmic art in general. However, in a stricter sense "fractal art" is not considered algorithmic art, because the algorithm is not devised by the artist.&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;

In light of such ongoing developments, pioneer algorithmic artist [[Ernest Edmonds]] has documented the continuing prophetic role of art in human affairs by tracing the early 1960s association between art and the computer up to a present time in which the algorithm is now widely recognized as a key concept for society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/1/3|author=Ernest Edmonds|date=15 January 2018|title=Algorithmic Art Machines|publisher=Arts|doi=10.3390/arts7010003|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The role of the algorithm==
[[File:Judson Rosebush Visions 15101 Computer Art April 22, 1978 JGR19780422 100.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|''Letter Field'' by Judson Rosebush, 1978. [[Calcomp plotter]] computer output with liquid inks on rag paper, 15.25 x 21 inches. This image was created using an early version of what became [[Digital Effects]]' Vision software, in [[APL (programming language)|APL]] and [[Fortran]] on an [[IBM 370]]/158. A database of the Souvenir font; [[Statistical randomness|random number]] generation, a statistical basis to determine letter size, color, and position; and a hidden line algorithm combine to produce this scan line [[raster image]], output to a plotter.]]

From one point of view, for a work of art to be considered algorithmic art, its creation must include a process based on an [[algorithm]] devised by the artist. Here, an algorithm is simply a detailed recipe for the design and possibly execution of an artwork, which may include [[computer code]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]], or other input which ultimately determines the form the art will take.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt; This input may be [[mathematical]], [[computation]]al, or generative in nature. Inasmuch as algorithms tend to be [[deterministic]], meaning that their repeated execution would always result in the production of identical artworks, some external factor is usually introduced. This can either be a random number generator of some sort, or an external body of data (which can range from recorded heartbeats to frames of a movie.) Some artists also work with organically based gestural input which is then modified by an algorithm. By this definition, [[fractal]]s made by a fractal program are not art, as humans are not involved. However, defined differently, algorithmic art can be seen to include fractal art, as well as other varieties such as those using [[genetic algorithm]]s. The artist [[Kerry Mitchell]] stated in his 1999 ''Fractal Art Manifesto'':&lt;ref name=Mitchell2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Kerry |title=Selected Works |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QUyAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |date=24 July 2009| publisher=Lulu.com&lt;!--This book is published by the artist himself, and can be relied on only for his own point of view.--&gt;|isbn=978-0-557-08398-5|pages=7–8}} This artist is notable for his place in the Fractal Art movement, as is his opinion and manifesto.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mitchell, Kerry |title=The Fractal Art Manifesto |url=https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm |publisher=Fractalus.com |accessdate=27 December 2015 |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Fractal Art is not..Computer(ized) Art, in the sense that the computer does all the work. The work is executed on a computer, but only at the direction of the artist. Turn a computer on and leave it alone for an hour. When you come back, no art will have been generated.&lt;ref name=Mitchell2009/&gt;}}

==Algorists==
"Algorist" is a term used for [[digital artist]]s who create algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=Verostko&gt;{{cite web |last1=Verostko |first1=Roman |title=Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.verostko.com/algorithm.html |date=1999 |origyear=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorists formally began correspondence and establishing their identity as artists following a panel titled "Art and Algorithms" at [[SIGGRAPH]] in 1995. The co-founders were [[Jean-Pierre Hébert]] and [[Roman Verostko]]. Hébert is credited with coining the term and its definition, which is in the form of his own algorithm:&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;

 if (creation &amp;&amp; object of art &amp;&amp; algorithm &amp;&amp; one's own algorithm) {
      return * an algorist *
 } else {
      return * not an algorist *
 }

===Types===

[[Cellular automata]] can be used to generate artistic patterns with an appearance of randomness, or to modify images such as photographs by applying a transformation such as the stepping stone rule (to give an impressionist style) repeatedly until the desired artistic effect is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoke |first1=Brian P. |title=Cellular Automata and Art |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.pattern/FinalProject/Hoke.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=24 December 2015 |date=21 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their use has also been explored in music.&lt;ref name="Burraston Edmonds 2005 pp. 165–185"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Burraston | first=Dave | last2=Edmonds | first2=Ernest | title=Cellular automata in generative electronic music and sonic art: a historical and technical review | journal=Digital Creativity | volume=16 | issue=3 | year=2005 | doi=10.1080/14626260500370882 | pages=165–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fractal art]] consists of varieties of computer-generated [[fractals]] with colouring chosen to give an attractive effect.&lt;ref name="fgad"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractal geometry in architecture and design |last=Bovill |first=Carl |year=1996 |publisher=Birkhauser |location=Boston |isbn=0-8176-3795-8 |page=153 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5ptaiGsac4C |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the western world, it is not drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of [[fractal-generating software]], [[iteration|iterating]] through three phases: setting [[parameter]]s of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other [[graphics software|graphics programs]] are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork.&lt;ref name="mra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casperjournal.com/article_bbe58a64-0b86-5e64-8fc5-459eafbe67fb.html |title=Meet Reginald Atkins, mathematical artist |author=Conner, Elysia |date=25 February 2009 |publisher=CasperJournal.com |accessdate=28 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic or evolutionary art makes use of [[genetic algorithm]]s to develop images iteratively, selecting at each "generation" according to a rule defined by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Eberle |first1=Robert |title=Evolutionary Art - Genetic Algorithm |url=http://www.saatchiart.com/art/New-Media-Evolutionary-Art-Genetic-Algorithm/57335/1837679/view |publisher=Saatchi Art |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reynolds |first1=Craig |title=Evolutionary Computation and its application to art and design |url=http://www.red3d.com/cwr/evolve.html |publisher=Reynolds engineering &amp; Design |accessdate=25 December 2015 |date=27 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorithmic art is not only produced by computers. Wendy Chun explains:&lt;ref name=Chun2011/&gt;

{{quote|Software is unique in its status as metaphor for metaphor itself. As A universal imitator/machine, it encapsulates a logic of general substitutability ; a logic of ordering and creative, animating disordering. Joseph Weizenbaum has argued that computers have become metaphors for "effective procedures," that is, for anything that can be solved in a prescribed number of steps, such as gene expression and clerical work.&lt;ref name=Chun2011&gt;{{cite book |author=Chun, Wendy Hui Kyong |year=2011 |title=Programmed Visions: Software and Memory |page=2 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0262518512}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The American artist, [[Jack Ox]], has used algorithms to produce paintings that are [[music visualization|visualizations of music]] without using a computer. Two examples are ''visual performances'' of extant scores, such as [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Bruckner)|Eighth Symphony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Ox, Jack |year=1990 |url=https://www.academia.edu/35788162/The_Systematic_Translation_of_Anton_Bruckners_Eighth_Symphony_into_a_Series_of_Thirteen_Paintings |title=The Systematic Translation of Anton Bruckner's Eighth Symphony into a Series of Thirteen Paintings |conference=Bruckner Symposium 1990 |location=Linz, Austria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intermediaprojects.org/pages/Bruckner.html |title=Bruckner: Eighth Symphony visualized themes |publisher=Intermedia Projects |accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kurt Schwitters]]' ''Ursonate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ox, Jack |year=1993 |title=Creating a Visual Translation of Kurt Schwitters' Ursonate |journal=Leonardo Music Journal |volume=3 |pages=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jackox.net/pages/Ursonate/UrPaintMv1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she and her collaborator, Dave Britton, created the 21st Century Virtual Color Organ that does use computer coding and algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ox |first1=Jack |last2=Britton |first2=Dave |year=2000 |url=https://www.academia.edu/785266/The_21st_century_virtual_reality_color_organ |title=The 21st Century Virtual Reality Color Organ |journal=Journal of IEEE Computer Society |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''An Honest Thief''' ({{lang-ru|Честный вор}}, ''Chestny vor'') is an 1848 short story by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]. The story recounts the tale of the tragic [[drunkard]],  Emelyan Ilyitch.

== Synopsis ==
The story opens with the narrator taking on a lodger in his apartment, an old soldier named Astafy Ivanovich. One day, a thief steals the narrator's coat, and Astafy tries to pursue him unsuccessfully. Astafy is dismayed by the theft and goes over the scenario over and over again. The narrator and Astafy share a distinct contempt for thieves, and one night Astafy tells the narrator a story of an honest thief that he had once run across.

One night in a pub, Astafy Ivanovich happened upon Emelyan Ilyitch. The two knew each other on beforehand, but now Emelyan was obviously poor from the look of his tattered coat. He was aching for a drink but had not the money. Astafy was moved by Emelyan's acutely pathetic position, and he bought him a drink. From then on, Emelyan followed Astafy everywhere, eventually moving into his apartment. Astafy did not have much money himself, but he allowed Emelyan's imposition because he was very aware that his drinking was a terrible problem. Emelyan would not stop his drinking, however, and even though he was quiet and not disruptive when he was drunk, Astafy could see that Emelyan would never be able to support himself with such a habit. Astafy urged him to quit drinking, but to no avail.  Eventually, Astafy effectively gave up on him and moved, never expecting to see Emelyan again.

Very soon after Astafy had moved Emelyan appears at his new apartment, and the two continue to go on as they had before. Astafy would support Emelyan with food and lodging, and Emelyan would always go out and come back drunk. Sometimes he would disappear for days only to return drunk and almost frozen.

Astafy, now working as a tailor, was short on money. One of his projects, a pair of riding breeches for a wealthy customer, were never claimed. He thought he could sell the breeches to get money for more useful clothes and some food, but when he decided to sell the breeches, they were nowhere to be found. Emelyan was drunk as usual, and denied the theft. Astafy was terribly vexed by the theft, and kept looking for the breeches while still suspicious of Emelyan.  Emelyan always denied the theft.

One day, Astafy and Emelyan had a terrible fight over the breeches and Emelyan's drinking, and Emelyan left the apartment and did not return for days. Astafy even went to look for him one day with no luck. Eventually, after a couple of days, Emelyan returned, almost starved and frozen.  Astafy took him back in, but it was clear that Emelyan's days were numbered. Days later, after Emelyan's health had deteriorated terribly, Emelyan wanted to tell Astafy something about the breeches. With his last words, Emelyan admitted to stealing the breeches.

The [[knowledge acquisition]] bottleneck is perhaps the major impediment to solving the [[word sense disambiguation]] (WSD) problem. [[Unsupervised learning]] methods rely on knowledge about word senses, which is barely formulated in dictionaries and lexical databases. [[Supervised learning]] methods depend heavily on the existence of manually annotated examples for every word sense, a requisite that can {{As of|2011|9|alt=so far}} be met only for a handful of words for testing purposes, as it is done in the [[Senseval]] exercises.

==Existing methods==
Therefore, one of the most promising trends in WSD research is using the largest corpus ever accessible, the [[World Wide Web]], to acquire lexical information automatically.&lt;ref&gt;Kilgarriff, A.; G. Grefenstette. 2003. [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J03-3001.pdf Introduction to the special issue on the Web as corpus]. Computational Linguistics 29(3)&lt;/ref&gt; WSD has been traditionally understood as an intermediate language engineering technology which could improve applications such as [[information retrieval]] (IR). In this case, however, the reverse is also true: Web search engines implement simple and robust IR techniques that can be successfully used when mining the Web for information to be employed in WSD.

The most direct way of using the Web (and other [[text corpus|corpora]]) to enhance WSD performance is the automatic acquisition of sense-tagged corpora, the fundamental resource to feed [[Supervised learning|supervised]] WSD algorithms. Although this is far from being commonplace in the WSD literature, a number of different and effective strategies to achieve this goal have already been proposed. Some of these strategies are:
* acquisition by direct [[Web searching]] (searches for monosemous synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, parsed gloss' words, etc.),
* [[Yarowsky algorithm]] (bootstrapping),
* acquisition via [[Web directories]], and
* acquisition via [[Bitext word alignment|cross-language meaning evidence]]s.

==Summary==

===Optimistic results===
The automatic extraction of examples to train supervised learning algorithms reviewed has been, by far, the best explored approach 
to mine the web for word sense disambiguation. Some results are certainly encouraging: 
* In some experiments, the quality of the Web data for WSD equals that of human-tagged examples. This is the case of the monosemous relatives plus bootstrapping with Semcor seeds technique&lt;ref&gt;Mihalcea, Rada. 2002. Bootstrapping large sense tagged corpora. Proceedings of  the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC),  Las Palmas,  Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; and the examples taken from the ODP Web directories.&lt;ref&gt;Santamaría, Celina, Julio Gonzalo &amp; Felisa Verdejo. 2003. Automatic association of Web directories to word senses. Computational Linguistics, 29(3): 485–502.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first case, however, Semcor-size example seeds are necessary (and only available for English), and it has only been tested with a very limited set of nouns; in the second case, the coverage is quite limited, and it is not yet clear whether it can be grown without compromising the quality of the examples retrieved.
* It has been shown&lt;ref&gt;Agirre, Eneko &amp; David Martínez. 2004. Unsupervised WSD based on automatically retrieved examples: The importance of bias. Proceedings of the Conference  on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), Barcelona,  Spain, 25–33.&lt;/ref&gt; that a mainstream supervised learning technique trained exclusively with web data can obtain better results than all unsupervised WSD systems which participated at Senseval-2.
* Web examples made a significant contribution to the best Senseval-2 English all-words system.&lt;ref&gt;Mihalcea, Rada. 2002a. Word sense disambiguation with pattern learning and  automatic feature selection. Natural Language Engineering, 8(4): 348–358.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difficulties===
There are, however, several open research issues related to the use of Web examples in WSD: 
* High precision in the retrieved examples (i.e., correct sense assignments for the examples) does not necessarily lead to good supervised WSD results (i.e., the examples are possibly not useful for training).&lt;ref&gt;Agirre, Eneko &amp; David Martínez. 2000. Exploring automatic word sense disambiguation with decision lists and the Web. Proceedings of the COLING Workshop on Semantic Annotation and Intelligent Annotation, Luxembourg, 11–19.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The most complete evaluation of Web examples for supervised WSD&lt;ref&gt;Agirre, Eneko &amp; David Martínez. 2004. Unsupervised WSD based on automatically retrieved examples: The importance of bias. Proceedings of the Conference  on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), Barcelona,  Spain, 25–33.&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that learning with Web data improves over unsupervised techniques, but the results are nevertheless far from those obtained with hand-tagged data, and do not even beat the most-frequent-sense baseline.
* Results are not always reproducible; the same or similar techniques may lead to different results in different experiments. Compare, for instance, Mihalcea (2002&lt;ref&gt;Mihalcea, Rada. 2002b. Bootstrapping large sense tagged corpora. Proceedings of  the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC),  Las Palmas,  Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;) with Agirre and Martínez (2004&lt;ref&gt;Agirre, Eneko &amp; David Martínez. 2004. Unsupervised WSD based on automatically retrieved examples: The importance of bias. Proceedings of the Conference  on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), Barcelona,  Spain, 25–33.&lt;/ref&gt;), or Agirre and Martínez (2000&lt;ref&gt;Agirre, Eneko &amp; David Martínez. 2000. Exploring automatic word sense disambiguation with decision lists and the Web. Proceedings of the COLING Workshop on Semantic Annotation and Intelligent Annotation, Luxembourg,  11–19.&lt;/ref&gt;) with Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999&lt;ref&gt;Mihalcea, Rada &amp; Dan Moldovan. 1999. An automatic method for generating  sense tagged corpora. Proceedings of the American Association for Artificial  Intelligence (AAAI), Orlando, U.S.A., 461–466.&lt;/ref&gt;). Results with Web data seem to be very sensitive to small differences in the learning algorithm, to when the corpus was extracted (search engines change continuously), and on small heuristic issues (e.g., differences in filters to discard part of the retrieved examples).
* Results are strongly dependent on bias (i.e., on the relative frequencies of examples per word sense).&lt;ref&gt;Agirre, Eneko &amp; David Martínez. 2004. Unsupervised WSD based on automati- cally retrieved examples: The importance of bias. Proceedings of the Conference  on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), Barcelona,  Spain, 25–33.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether this is simply a problem of Web data, or an intrinsic problem of supervised learning techniques, or just a problem of how WSD systems are evaluated (indeed, testing with rather small Senseval data may overemphasize sense distributions compared to sense distributions obtained from the full Web as corpus).
* In any case, Web data has an intrinsic bias, because queries to search engines directly constrain the context of the examples retrieved. There are approaches that alleviate this problem, such as using several different seeds/queries per sense&lt;ref&gt;Mihalcea, Rada. 2002b. Bootstrapping large sense tagged corpora. Proceedings of  the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC),  Las Palmas,  Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; or assigning senses to Web directories and then scanning directories for examples;&lt;ref&gt;Santamaría, Celina, Julio Gonzalo &amp; Felisa Verdejo. 2003. Automatic association  of Web directories to word senses. Computational Linguistics, 29(3): 485–502.&lt;/ref&gt; but this problem is nevertheless far from being solved.
* Once a Web corpus of examples is built, it is not entirely clear whether its distribution is safe from a legal perspective.

===Future===
Besides automatic acquisition of examples from the Web, there are some other WSD experiments that have profited from the Web: 
* The Web as a social network has been successfully used for [[Mass collaboration|cooperative annotation]] of a corpus (OMWE, Open Mind Word Expert project),&lt;ref&gt;Chklovski, Tim &amp; Rada Mihalcea. 2002. Building a sense tagged corpus with  Open Mind Word Expert.  Proceedings of the ACL SIGLEX Workshop on  Word Sense Disambiguation: Recent Successes and Future Directions, Philadelphia, U.S.A., 116–122.&lt;/ref&gt; which has already been used in three Senseval-3 tasks (English, Romanian and Multilingual).
* The Web has been used to enrich WordNet senses with domain information: topic signatures&lt;ref&gt;Agirre, Eneko, Olatz Ansa, Eduard H. Hovy &amp; David Martínez. 2000. Enriching  very large ontologies using the WWW.

'''Bash Back!''' was a network of radical, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[queer]] projects within the United States. Formed in [[Chicago]] in 2007 to facilitate a convergence of radical trans and gay activists from around the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Radical Transfolk and Queers Converge In Chicago April 5th | url= http://milwaukee.indymedia.org/en/2008/01/208992.shtml | last= Bash Back Chicago! | accessdate= 2008-10-16 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726180029/http://milwaukee.indymedia.org/en/2008/01/208992.shtml | archive-date= 2011-07-26 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bash Back! sought to critique the ideology of the mainstream [[LGBT]] movement, which the group saw as [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into the dominant institutions of a [[heteronormative]] society. Bash Back! was noticeably influenced by the [[anarchist]] movement and radical queer groups, such as [[ACT UP]] and [[Gay Shame]], and took inspiration from the [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] and San Francisco's [[White Night riots]].&lt;ref name="bashbacknews.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web | title= About BB! News | url= http://bashbacknews.wordpress.com/about/ | accessdate= 2008-10-16 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081224084953/http://bashbacknews.wordpress.com/about/ | archive-date= 2008-12-24 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, [[Bash Back#Chapters|other chapters]] had formed and had carried out various [[direct action]]s across the US. In July 2011, after a ruling involving the 2008 incident at Mount Hope Church in Lansing, Michigan, Andy Field, former Bash Back president for the Lansing chapter stated, "There is no Bash Back! anymore," due to "internal politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Balaskovitz |first=Andy |url=http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/article-6100-bash-back_-resolved.html |title=Bash Back! resolved |publisher=Lansingcitypulse.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Points of unity"==
According to their website, anyone could form a Bash Back! chapter as long as they adhered to the basic points of unity:
# Fight for liberation. Nothing more, nothing less. State recognition in the form of oppressive institutions such as marriage and militarism are not steps toward liberation but rather towards heteronormative assimilation.
# A rejection of [[capitalism]], [[imperialism]], and all forms of state power.
# Actively oppose oppression both in and out of the "movement." No oppressive behavior is to be tolerated.
# Respect a diversity of tactics in the struggle for liberation. Also, do not solely condemn an action on the grounds that the state deems it to be illegal.

==Actions==

===First collective action===
The first Bash Back! Convergence was held in April 2008{{clarify|date=July 2011}}. The goal of the convergence was to form ideas for the then-upcoming protests at the DNC and the RNC, and discuss the formation of new Bash Back! chapters in other regions of the country. As a result, groups in [[Milwaukee]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Denver]], [[Lansing]], and [[upstate New York]] sprung up as new chapters.

Together, members of the newly formed Bash Back! groups took to the streets of Chicago's [[Boystown, Chicago|Boystown]] neighborhood in protest of assimilationist politics, trans-exclusion in the gay community, and recent police assaults on trans and queer people. The unpermitted march was eventually dispersed when a crowd surrounded the Chicago Police's Addison/Halsted headquarters, reading aloud statistics of trans and queer people killed by police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back! Marches in Chicago | url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=18024 | accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2008 [[Milwaukee Pridefest]]===
[[Image:Milkwaukeenaziconfrontation.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Bash Back! Milwaukee Displaying Banner at Milwaukee Pridefest]]
In June 2008, the [[neo-Nazi]] organization the [[National Socialist Movement (United States)|National Socialist Movement]], released a statement that announced its intention to demonstrate at Milwaukee's annual [[PrideFest (Milwaukee)|Pridefest]] as a statement that the Nazis do not support "the promotion of homosexuality in [their] community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Milwaukee Summerfest | url=http://www.nsm88.org/activities/milwaukee%20summerfest.html | website=National Socialist Movement | accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neo Nazis, Riot Gear, and the Pink Bloc |url=http://altdash.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=74 |first=Tea |last=Krulos |accessdate=2008-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803142501/http://www.altdash.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=74 |archivedate=August 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of more than twenty confronted members of the NSM, carrying a banner proclaiming "These Faggots Kill Fascists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Pictures From Milwaukee Pridefest | url= http://milwaukee.indymedia.org/en/2008/06/209763.shtml | first= m. | last= boozie | accessdate= 2008-10-16 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080615011519/http://milwaukee.indymedia.org/en/2008/06/209763.shtml | archive-date= 2008-06-15 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The action prompted Pridefest organizers to criticize Bash Back!. Members of Bash Back! Milwaukee in turn denounced the organizers as betraying the queer community, stating "They would rather see well protected neo-nazis than a well-defended queer and trans community. Nobody will protect us if not ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back! MKE Statement About Pridefest and Nazi Confrontation | url= http://milwaukee.indymedia.org/en/2008/06/209779.shtml | first=  | accessdate= 2008-10-16 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080616143144/http://milwaukee.indymedia.org/en/2008/06/209779.shtml | archive-date= 2008-06-16 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===July 2008 Chicago Pride events===
Bash Back! Chicago carried out a number of actions during their city's Pride Weekend in 2008. The first was participation in the annual [[Chicago Dyke March]] in Chicago's [[Lower West Side, Chicago|Pilsen]] neighborhood. Bash Back!'s contingent in the march focused on resistance to [[gentrification]] in the Pilsen community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Dyke March: Different neighborhood, same message | url= http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=18803 | first=Yasmin | last=Nair | accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a large lead banner stating "Bash Back Against Gentrification!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back Pride Pt.1: The Dyke March! | url= http://chicago.indymedia.org/newswire/display/83058/index.php | first= | accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, members of Bash Back! also took part in Chicago's larger [[Chicago Pride Parade]]. Bash Back! Chicago wheeled a cage through the parade containing a member dressed as Chicago's [[Mayor Richard M. Daley]], whom the group believes is responsible for cutting AIDS funding, turning a blind eye to police torture and brutality, and supporting gentrification. Simultaneously, members of Bash Back! also distributed barf bags with slogans written on them such as "Corporate Pride Makes Me Sick," a statement about the commercial and assimilative intentions of mainstream gay culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back! makes point at parade | url= http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=18827 | first=Yasmin | last=Nair | accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 Memphis Pride Festival===
In 2008, [[Mid-South Pride]], organizers of the [[Memphis Pride Festival]], announced that the 2008 festival would be co-anchored by Nike and called the move an "expansion opportunity for the GLBT citizens of the city". Outraged, Bash Back! Memphis wheatpasted fliers along Cooper Street{{clarify|date=July 2011}} the night before the march condemning Nike's sweatshop practices and mainstream gay culture. The following day{{When|date=May 2010}}, as the Memphis Pride march proceeded under the [[Cooper-Young, Memphis|Cooper-Young]] railroad trestle, several BB! members dropped a banner reading "Queer Liberation, not Queer Consumerism".{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===August 2008 [[Democratic National Convention]]===
At the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]], Bash Back! Denver organized a protest of a fundraiser for the [[Human Rights Campaign]], a gay rights lobby group. Bash Back! Denver criticized the HRC for its policies of trans exclusion in the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]], as well as the HRC's support for corporate interests and the [[Iraq War]]. The action ended in the detention of four activists at the scene and the arrest of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= DNC: 4 Detained, 1 Arrested @ Bash Back!

Bash Back! also organized a "trans and queer bloc" as part of the larger [[black bloc]] of the Anti-Capitalista Day of Action. The event ended in the detention of most participants, and several bystanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Video of the Anti-Capitalista march, and subsequent arrests. | url= http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2008/08/26/18530099.php | accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, Bash Back! continued to counter-protest, especially against conservatives holding signs reading things like "homo-sex is a sin" by having a queer kiss-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= DNC Protests: Day Three | url= http://rogueimc.org/en/2008/08/13816.shtml | accessdate= 2008-10-18 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615235123/http://rogueimc.org/en/2008/08/13816.shtml | archive-date= 2011-06-15 | dead-url= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 2008 [[Republican National Convention]]===
At the [[2008 Republican National Convention]], members of various Bash Back! groups from around the country participated in a road blockade as a part of [[Unconventional Action]]'s direct action strategy to disrupt the convention. BB seized an intersection in downtown St. Paul and blocked cars and delegate buses from passing by having a festive dance party. The blockade was eventually met with force by mounted police and the activists were forced to disperse. Soon afterwards, members of Bash Back! also confronted the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] when they appeared at the intersection where Bash Back! conducted its action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= "Act up, Bash Back!"

===October 2008 Annual Human Rights Campaign Dinner===
On October 4, 2008, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) held its annual dinner in Washington DC. Bash Back! DC confronted the organization once again for publicly not supporting a trans-inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination Act in the House of Representatives in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Ted Kennedy pushing non-trans inclusive ENDA | url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/TF_in_news/08_0411/stories/2_kennedy_noninclusive_enda.pdf |format=PDF| first=Andrew | last=Miga | accessdate=2008-11-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081113020015/http://www.thetaskforce.org/TF_in_news/08_0411/stories/2_kennedy_noninclusive_enda.pdf| archivedate= 13 November 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 20 protestors gathered for a dance party at the front doors of the fundraiser with signs such as “HRC Is Not For Me” and “Stonewall Was a Riot”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back!

DC, stated that the reason for the protest was that "assimilation will not save us, it will only end in the decimation of our community. Society must change to accommodate us, queers and transfolk must refuse assimilation and cultural erasure at the hands of the homonormative gay elite and build a world where we can liberate ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back!

===November 2008 protest at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, Michigan===
On November 9, 2008, a contingent from Bash Back!'s [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] chapter picketed outside Mount Hope Church, because the church promoted traditional biblical strictures concerning homosexuality. Meanwhile, several Bash Back! members entered the building disguised in plain-clothes and disrupted a worship service. During the late morning service the group dropped a rainbow banner bearing the slogan "It's Okay to Be Gay! Bash Back!" from the sanctuary balcony and showered a thousand fliers exhorting teenagers in the congregation to "embrace and explore" their feelings, and assuring them there are many organizations supportive of gays that "enable you to be who you truly are."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081112/NEWS01/811120369 |title= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://bashbacknews.wordpress.com/2008/11/11/bash-back-raises-hell-at-anti-queer-mega-church/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202184649/http://bashbacknews.wordpress.com/2008/11/11/bash-back-raises-hell-at-anti-queer-mega-church/ |date=February 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris, Nathan p. 6"&gt;Harris, Nathan.

According to ''Bash Back! News'', Mount Hope Church was targeted for its [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] belief that homosexuality is a sin, for its production of "[[hell house]]s" that demonize gays, and for its hosting of conferences of "ex-gays."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris, Nathan p. 6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20081120132957147 |title=Bash Back!

In May 2009, [[Alliance Defense Fund]] filed a federal lawsuit against Bash Back! on behalf of the church, under the [[Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/article/20090515/NEWS01/905150322/1002/NEWS01 |title= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-11-01}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNamara |first=Neal |url=http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/article-3061-bash-back-retains-lawyer-in-protest-suit.html |title=Bash Back retains lawyer in protest suit |publisher=Lansingcitypulse.com |date=2009-06-08 |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those sued refused to name others who participated in the protest, so Mount Hope Church issued a subpoena to Riseup Networks in an attempt to obtain the names of email account holders who the church believed either participated in the action or knew who did. As part of a settlement, the activists agreed to a permanent injunction preventing them from disrupting any religious services in the US.  They also agreed to pay the church $2,750 in damages. The district court entered a default judgment against Bash Back! and Bash Back! Lansing, and closed the case.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Phillips, [http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2012/11/27/homophobic-church-persuades-appellate-court-to-overrule-protest-related-sanctions-award/ "Homophobic Church Persuades Appellate Court to Overrule Protest-Related Sanctions Award"], Activist Defense, November 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 "Avenge Duanna" Campaign===
In November 2008, to coincide with [[transgender]] day of remembrance, Bash Back! groups began staging actions in memory of [[Duanna Johnson]], a [[trans woman]] who was brutally beaten by Memphis police officers and murdered while in the process of suing the police department. Many within the Memphis queer community are convinced that the police had a hand in her murder. Bash Back! Philly shut down downtown Philadelphia in a [[reclaim the streets|reclaim-the-streets]] style action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Bash Back!

===2008 [[California Proposition 8]]===
An affiliate group of Bash Back! claimed credit for pouring glue into the locks of an [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS church]] building and spray painting on its walls. An internet posting signed by Bash Back!’s [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], Washington chapter said: “The Mormon church ... needs to be confronted, attacked, subverted and destroyed.”&lt;ref name="Bash Back"&gt;{{cite web|title=Radical Gay Activist Group Plans More Disruptions |publisher=Chicago Tribune |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/nov/20/news/chi-ap-mi-gayactivistprotes |date=November 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116125804/http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/nov/20/news/chi-ap-mi-gayactivistprotes |archivedate=November 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', the acts of vandalism against the LDS Church appear to be in retaliation for support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]].&lt;ref name="Bash Back" /&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2010}} The [[Anti-Defamation League]] released a statement condemning the "defacement and destruction of property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= ADL Condemns Criminal Activity Targeting Religious Institutions That Supported Proposition 8 | publisher= [[Anti-Defamation League]] | date= 2008-11-10 | url= http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/11-10-2008/0004922404&amp;EDATE= | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220073525/http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F11-10-2008%2F0004922404&amp;EDATE= | archivedate= 2008-12-20 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===October 2009 vandalism of Human Rights Campaign headquarters===
On October 11, 2009 the [[Human Rights Campaign]] headquarters in Washington, DC was vandalized by radical queer activists who threw pink and black paint and glitter at the building and left graffiti reading "Quit Leaving Queers Behind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lezgetreal.com/?p=22182 HRC Building Vandalized] ''Lez Get Real'' Retrieved 12 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The vandalism came on the eve of the [[National Equality March]], the biggest national queer political mobilization since 2000 and hours after [[U.S. President|President]] [[Barack Obama]] gave a speech at an HRC fundraiser. A group called Queers Against Assimilation posted a statement about the action on the website of radical queer network Bash Back!. The statement called the attack an act of "glamdalism."

==Corporate history==
The company was founded in 2000 by Douglas Ross, who had previously run a computer systems company, and Andrew Bilinski, who had worked for the [[US Air Force]], [[Electronic Data Systems|EDS]] &amp; BDM International.  Ross originally come up with the idea for Booksfree in 1999, and after selling his company was looking at what to do next.  [[United States dollar|US$]]1 million of start-up funding was provided by friends &amp; associates.  In 2008, Booksfree was recognized by Inc. Magazine as one of America’s top 5,000 fastest growing privately held companies.  In February 2009 they shipped their 2 millionth book.  In May 2010, the company launched a complementary online book and audiobook swap service [http://www.booksfreeswap.com BooksfreeSwap].  The free book swap service was developed in response to customer demand for books and audiobooks that were not available through their rental service.  An audiobook download and streaming service [http://www.audiobooksnow.com AudiobooksNow] was started by Booksfree in January 2012 to meet the growing demand for digital content.  On November 2, 2016 Booksfree rebranded itself as [http://www.booklender.com BookLender].  The company felt the name BookLender better represents what the company does.&lt;ref name="FairfaxTimes20070411" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPost20021002"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Bookmobile Reinvented; Va.

==Business model==
The company has been described as "the books version of [[Netflix]]",&lt;ref name="O200703"&gt;{{cite news|title=Book Junkies, Rejoice! | url=http://www.booksfree.com/oprah_article.shtml | date=2007-03-01 | accessdate=2008-04-14 | publisher=O the Oprah Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore has a similar business model to [[online DVD rental]] companies.  Titles are offered in [[paperback]], [[compact disc|CD]] &amp; [[MP3]] CD [[audiobook]] formats.  Separate monthly membership plans are offered for each medium starting at $9.99 for books, $12.99 for MP3-CD audiobooks &amp; $22.49 for CD &amp; MP3 CD audiobooks.  A combination membership encompassing all media is also available.  Each plan limits the number of items that can be checked out at any one time.  Subscribers can pay a higher monthly fee in order to increase that limit.  It is also possible to rent individual titles without having a membership.&lt;ref name="BFAvailMem"&gt;{{cite web | title=Available Membership Plans | url=http://www.booksfree.com/available_plans.shtml | publisher=Booksfree | accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitive environment==
The company's founders were quoted in 2002 as considering their main competition to be [[libraries]] and online book retailers, noting that each has drawbacks compared with Booksfree.&lt;ref name="WashPost20021002" /&gt;  Comparisons between the services generally focus upon the availability of audiobooks from Booksfree and their decision to not carry [[hardcover]] books.&lt;ref name="PW20070702"&gt;{{cite news |title=Netflix Book Model Draws Competitors |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6456823.html |first=Lynn |last=Andriani |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=2007-07-02 |accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313081005/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6456823.html |archivedate=March 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BrerFoxBear.jpg|thumb|right|Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear in ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946). Disney's versions of the characters are drawn in a more humorous and cartoony style than the illustrations in Harris's books.]]
'''Br'er Fox''' and '''Br'er Bear''' (also spelled '''Brer Fox''' and '''Brer Bear''', {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|e@r}}) are [[fictional character]]s from the [[Uncle Remus]] folktales adapted and compiled by [[Joel Chandler Harris]].

In the animated sequences of the 1946 [[Walt Disney]]-produced film ''[[Song of the South]]'' like in the tales, Brer Fox is the stories' antagonist, while Brer Bear is his dim-witted henchman. Brer Fox was voiced by actor [[James Baskett]], who also portrayed the live-action character [[Uncle Remus]], and Brer Bear was voiced by [[Nick Stewart]]. In later appearances of the characters, the two were voiced by [[J.D. Hall]] and [[James Avery (actor)|James Avery]]. In contrast to the earlier illustrations of [[Frederick S. Church]], [[A. B. Frost]], and [[E. W. Kemble]], the Disney animators depict the characters in a more slapstick, cartoony style.&lt;ref&gt;Brasch, Walter M. (2000). ''Brer Rabbit, Uncle Remus, and the 'Cornfield Journalist':  The Tale of Joel Chandler Harris''. [[Mercer University Press]]. p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cult film]] ''[[Coonskin (film)|Coonskin]]'', directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]], focuses on a trio of characters inspired by the original folktales. [[Br'er Rabbit]], Br'er Bear and Br'er Fox (renamed "Preacher Fox" in the film) all appear, and the elements of the stories are moved to a then-contemporary urban setting.

==Other appearances==
The Disney versions of the characters have made appearances in other works:
*Brer Fox and Brer Bear appear in the [[Splash Mountain]] attractions at [[Disneyland]], [[Walt Disney World|Walt Disney World's]] [[Magic Kingdom]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]]. They also appear with Brer Rabbit at the [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] for meet-and-greets, parades and shows.
*An entire segment dedicated to the pair is featured in the 1956 one-hour television special ''[[Our Unsung Villains]]''.
*Brer Fox and Brer Bear make cameo appearances in several episodes{{which|date=May 2014}} of the ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' television series, with ''Bonkers'' in the episode "Casabonkers," and in the direct-to-video release ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''. 
*Brer Bear has made cameo appearances in other Disney films. He can be seen frequently in various scenes in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', and he is also seen in ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'' along with many other Disney [[cartoon character|toon]]s coming into the theater in the ending scene.
*Brer Bear has also made sporadic appearances in Disney's Gladstone comics.&lt;ref&gt;''Walt Disney Comics Digest'' #27 February 1971 "The Seven Dwarfs "The Inside Hideout"&lt;/ref&gt; Although one Disney comic names Br'er Bear a title of "Honorary Constable of Cockleberry County"&lt;ref&gt;"Walt Disney Comics Digest" #23 July 1970 "Stomps in the Night"&lt;/ref&gt; his "performance" is more akin to [[Fearless Fosdick]]; as a [[comic relief]] villain Br'er Bear-along with Br'er Fox &amp; Br'er Weasel-are members of the "Foul Order of Foulfellows".&lt;ref&gt;''Walt Disney Comics Digest'' # 21 April 1970 "The Conscience Plot",&lt;/ref&gt; {A possible member of the foulfellows is Br'er "Zeke" Wolf aka [[Big Bad Wolf]] although a running gag is that whenever he tries to catch either the Three Little pigs or a chicken, his plans go awry and Br'er wolf gets being pounded by Br'er Bear!}&lt;ref&gt;"Walt Disney Comics Digest #19 January 1970 "The Moon Creature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Walt Disney Comics Digest # 27 February 1971 "Gingerbread House Hoax"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Walt Disney Comics Digest # 29 June 1971 "The Sleepwalker"&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Brer Fox is slightly smarter than Brer Bear-although like his contemporary villain compatriot Brer Zeke Wolf aka the [[Big Bad Wolf]] a running gag is that he usually fails whatever he tries&lt;ref&gt;"Walt Disney Comics Digest # 21 April 1970 "The Conscience Plot" and "Brer Rabbit Meets the reluctant Dragon"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Walt Disney Comics Digest # 29 June 1971 "Farm Friends and the Flying Farm Hand"&lt;/ref&gt; Only once did he ever succeed at anything-when he stole a chicken from a pen kept by the three Little Piggs&lt;ref&gt;"Walt Disney Comics Digest #21 April 1970 "Mumbo Jumbo"&lt;/ref&gt;
*They appear often in the Dutch ''Donald Duck'' comics,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} usually hunting Broer Konijn (Dutch for ''Brer Rabbit'').
*Both Brer Bear and Brer Fox make an appearance in the video game ''[[Disneyland Adventures]]'', and both can be seen near [[Splash Mountain]] in Critter Country.

'''Canarian Americans''' are [[Americans]] whose ancestors came from the [[Canary Islands]], Spain. They can trace their ancestry to settlers and immigrants who have emigrated since the 16th century to the present-day United States. Most of them are descendants of settlers who emigrated to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies]] in the South of the modern US during the 18th century. The Canarians were among the first settlers of the modern United States{{cn|date=January 2017}}; the first Canarians migrated to modern Florida in 1569, and were followed by others coming to [[Spanish Florida|''La Florida'']], [[Texas]] and [[Spanish Louisiana|Louisiana]].

Canarian Americans today consist of several communities, formed by thousands of people{{CN|date=January 2017}}. Those in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] and in Louisiana are mostly of Canarian settler descent. Their ancestors arrived in what is now the United States in the 18th century, while the Canarian community in [[Miami]] is made up of recent emigrants and their children. These communities are culturally distinct within the American population, having preserved much of the culture of their ancestors to present times.

Most Canarian Americans now speak only English, although some Canarian communities that speak different dialects of the Spanish language are still extant in Louisiana. These include the ''Isleños'' of [[Saint Bernard Parish]] who have managed to preserve their culture as well as their dialect of [[Canarian Spanish]], although none of the younger generation speak more than a few words; the ''Brulis'', who live in scattered households in southern Louisiana and speak a dialect with French loan words; and the ''Adaeseños'' in the Natchatoches and Sabine parishes who speak a very similar dialect with loan words from the [[Nahuatl dialects|Nahuatl]] language of Mexico. The success of Canarian Americans of settler origin in preserving their culture has led some historians and anthropologists, such as Jose Manuel Balbuena Castellano, to consider the Isleño American community a [[cultural heritage|national heritage]] of both the United States and the Canary Islands.

== History ==
Canarian emigration to North America started in the 16th century, when Spain had several colonies stretching around the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The first Canarians arrived in the region as early as 1539, when the Spanish explorer [[Hernando de Soto]] recruited Canary Islanders to join his expeditions to explore the wilderness of [[Spanish Florida|La Florida]]. The Canarian scholar Javier González Antón says some Canary Islanders went to Florida with [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés|Pedro Menéndez]], who founded [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], the first permanent European settlement in what is now the United States, in 1565.&lt;ref name="Antón2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Javier González Antón|title=El documento americanista y Canarias|journal=Anuario Americanista Europeo|date=2007|issue=4-5|page=153|url=http://www.red-redial.net/doc_adj/anuario/67-documento-americanista.pdf|location=Tenerife, Canary Islands|format=PDF|issn=2221-3872|quote=Por Canarias pasarían en 1565, 1569, 1572 y 1576 las expediciones de, Menéndez de Avilés, Fernández Serpa, Ortiz de Zárate y Maraver de Silva con destino a San Agustín de la Florida, Cumaná, Río de la Plata y Guayana. El adelantado de la Florida, Menéndez de Avilés, para fundar San Agustín.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other Spanish colonies in the large area (from present-day Virginia to Texas) then called La Florida remained lightly populated due to the scant attention paid them by the Spanish government after it realized that these colonies lacked gold and silver mines and other sources of wealth. During the late 17th and much of the 18th century (1684–1764), the so-called ''Tributo de Sangre'' (Blood Tribute) was in effect; this was a Spanish law stipulating that for every thousand tons of cargo shipped from [[Spanish America]] to Spain, 50 Canarian families would be sent to America to populate regions having low populations of ''[[Peninsulares]]'', or Spanish-born Spaniards.&lt;ref name="González2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manuel Hernández González|title=La Emigración Canaria a América|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IM8SAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Tributo%20de%20Sangre%22|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Centro de la Cultura Popular Canaria|isbn=978-84-7926-488-8|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish crown sent several groups of Canarian settlers to its North American colonies, but the number of Canarian families emigrating to America usually exceeded the number of families called for by the regulations.&lt;ref&gt;González 2005, pp. 15, 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1731 and 1783, many Canarian families emigrated to the southern colonies, establishing their own communities there. In 1731, 16 Canarian families were sent to [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]], most of them coming directly from the Canary Islands (some came from [[Havana]]). After arriving at [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], they were forced to cross overland on foot to Texas, led by the Canarian [[Juan Leal Goraz]], who eventually would become the first mayor of San Antonio. This community had confrontations with the resident Catholic monks of the area over property rights and the diversion of water from the rivers.&lt;ref name="odisea canaria"/&gt;

Between 1718 and 1734, Florida was governed by Lt. General [[Antonio de Benavides]], a native of [[Tenerife]] in the Canary Islands, while [[Carlos Benites Franquis de Lugo]] and [[Simón de Herrera]], both natives of Tenerife, governed Texas in 1736–1737 and in 1811 respectively.&lt;ref name=Blake2010&gt;{{cite web|author1=Robert Bruce Blake|title=Carlos Benites Franquis de Lugo|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffr04|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=18 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710042347/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffr04|archivedate=July 10, 2011|date=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WarrenHolmes2010&gt;{{cite web|author1=Harris Gaylord Warren|author2=Jack D.

In 1740, ''La Real Compañía de Comercio de La Habana'' (The Royal Society of Commerce of Havana), a monopolistic corporation formed to encourage commercial traffic between Cuba and Florida,&lt;ref name="Ezquerra2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfredo Alvar Ezquerra|title=Exchange rate economics: where do we stand?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rZm-M6-TnxsC&amp;pg=PA193|year=2006|publisher=[[Ediciones Akal]]|isbn=978-84-7090-472-1|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Universidad de la Habana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5jWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%221740%22|year=2003|publisher=Centro de Informacion Cientifica y Tecnica, Universidad de la Habana|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; was required by Spanish statutes to provide two vessels bringing 50 Canarian families annually to Florida. Between 1757 and 1759, 121 Canarian families were sent to Florida, (although most of the settlers emigrated to Cuba when the province was ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] after the [[Seven Years' War]]), followed by another 863 Canarian families in the years after the loss of the province, according to authors Carlos Canales Torres and Fernando Martinez Láinez.&lt;ref name="LáinezCanales2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fernando Martínez Láinez|author2=Carlos Canales|title=Banderas Lejanas: La exploración, conquista, y defensa por España del territorio de los actuales Estados Unidos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSDId1F9TmcC&amp;pg=PA250|date=25 March 2009|publisher=EDAF|isbn=978-84-414-2119-6|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida was returned to Spain in 1783. When Florida was ceded to the United States in 1819, however, most of the new settlers also emigrated to Cuba, as happened in 1763, when Florida was ceded to Great Britain.

After the elimination of the ''Tributo de Sangre'' law, between 1778 and 1783 over 4,000 Canarians were sent to [[Louisiana]], although half of them remained in [[Venezuela]] and [[Cuba]] where their ships had stopped over during the passage; some 2,100 Canarians settled in those places. In Louisiana, the settlers eventually consolidated into three communities: [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard Parish]], Valenzuela (where the Canarians intermarried with [[Cajuns]] and their descendants speak French), and [[Barataria, Louisiana|Barataria]] (abandoned shortly after a hurricane struck, its settlers relocated elsewhere in Louisiana and Florida). In 1779, other Canarians were established in [[Galveston, Texas]] along with Mexican soldiers in the garrison, but after prolonged droughts interrupted by sudden floods, were resettled near [[Baton Rouge]] in 1800, where they founded Galveztown.&lt;ref&gt;González 2005, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Other places in the southern United States had Canarian settlers during the Spanish period. A few communities were founded by Canary Island colonists in [[Southern California]]&lt;ref name="Canarias y América"/&gt; and there are records of Canary Islanders colonists and their descendants living in [[New Mexico]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Piqué2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Alfredo Herrera Piqué|title=Presencia canaria en el sur de Estados Unidos.|journal=Bienmesabe eJournal|date=May 20, 2006|issue=606|url=http://www.bienmesabe.org/noticia/2006/Mayo/presencia-canaria-en-el-sur-de-estados-unidos|accessdate=25 December 2015|trans-title=The Canarian Presence in the Southern United States|publisher=Arucas, Las Palmas Asociación Cultural Bienmesabe|location=Las Palmas|format=online|issn=1885-6039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since they arrived in America in the 16th century, Isleños have played their part in some historic events: they participated in the [[American Revolutionary War]] (in 1782 – 83), fought in the [[War of 1812]] (in 1814), defended [[Battle of the Alamo|the Alamo]] (in 1836), and after the incorporation of Louisiana and Texas into the United States, they fought in the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), both [[World Wars]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Remarkably, in the 1950s, local government forced all students of the Saint Bernard Parish school system in Louisiana to speak only English, while Hispanics in the parish were not even allowed to speak Spanish in public; eventually there were no Spanish language-speakers left in the local Isleño community.

Beginning early in the 20th century, a different sort of Canarian emigration to America has taken place, primarily to Florida, of migrants not officially sanctioned or subsidized, but coming by their own means. Many Canarians live in the United States temporarily as [[Foreign worker|migrant workers]].

== Communities ==
Several Canarian American communities remain in the southern United States: there are ''Isleño'' communities in [[Saint Bernard Parish]], ''Brulis'' in scattered households in southern Louisiana, and the ''Adaeseños'' in the Natchatoches and Sabine parishes, as well as a Canarian community in San Antonio, Texas. The city of Miami, Florida has a Canarian community of recent immigrants. There are also Canarians living in Boston, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Washington D.C., and California. Currently, according to data of the Padrón de Españoles Residentes en el Extranjero (PERE; Register of Spaniards Resident Abroad), released on March 20, 2014 by the National Statistics Institute (INE), in 2013, there were 5,127 Canarians living in the United States.&lt;ref name="la opinión, canarios en el extranjero"&gt;[http://www.laopinion.es/canarias/2014/03/21/cifra-islenos-emigraron-extranjero-crecio/532303.html La opinión.es: La cifra de isleños que emigraron al extranjero creció un 7,5% en 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;

Canarian culture in San Antonio and Louisiana has been preserved up to the present day, although not in Florida.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Although the Canarians promoted agriculture in the province of Florida, most Canarian settlers there emigrated to Cuba when the province was ceded to Great Britain in 1763. Some of them returned when Florida was recovered by Spain in 1783. When Florida was ceded to United States in 1819, most of the Canarian population of colonial origin emigrated to Cuba, just as they had done when Florida had been ceded to Great Britain. However, after 1819, a new Canarian immigration to Florida began when it was ceded to the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isleños in Louisiana ===
{{Main article|Isleños in Louisiana}}
The majority of them descended from Canarian settlers who arrived in Louisiana between 1778 and 1783.  According to [[Samuel G. Armistead]], there are four small areas of the state where the Spanish language has been spoken since the 18th century, now in three different dialects. The main Isleño community in Louisiana is in St. Bernard Parish. Although most of its members, especially the younger people, speak only English, some of the older Isleños still speak a rustic and antiquated [[Canarian Spanish]] and maintain traditions like roasting pig and hunting small birds. The other communities of Canarian descent include the ''Brulis'', who live in scattered households in southern Louisiana; they speak a Spanish dialect with French infusions, while the ''Adaeseños'' in Natchitoches and Sabine parishes speak a very similar dialect, with loan words from the [[Nahuatl dialects|Nahuatl]] language of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Armistead19929"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel G. Armistead|title=The Spanish Tradition in Louisiana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oA4MAAAAYAAJ|year=1992|publisher=Juan de la Cuesta|isbn=978-0-936388-51-9|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recorded interviews have been conducted in these communities with the elderly residents, who still speak their dialect of the Spanish language on video and DVD.&lt;ref name="Armistead1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel G.

=== Canary Islanders and the founding of San Antonio, Texas ===
[[File:San antonio tex 1939.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the city, San Antonio, December 4, 1939]]
On February 14, 1719, the governor of Texas, [[Marqués de San Miguel de Aguayo|José de Azlor]], made a proposal to King [[Philip V of Spain]] that 400 families be transported from the [[Canary Islands]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and [[Havana]] to populate the province of [[Texas]]. His plan was approved, and notice was given the [[Canary Islanders]] (''Isleños'') to provide 200 families for the venture; the Council of the Indies suggested that 400 families should be sent from the Canaries to Texas by way of Havana and Veracruz.&lt;ref name="rootsweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rootsweb.com/~txbexar/canarydes.html|title=Numbered heads of Canary Islands families (taken from the Quantitlan List, November 8th, 1731, Mexico|publisher=Roots web|deadurl=y|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516094754/http://www.rootsweb.com/~txbexar/canarydes.html|archivedate=May 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the arrival of the Canarian settlers in 1730, the San Pedro channel was built for the exclusive use of the Canary Island colonists. It was called the ''acequia madre'', the "mother ditch" that crossed the city. Its waters irrigated agricultural fields around San Antonio from that time until 1906. The last channel to supply water to the citizens was dug in 1777 for the new settlers of [[Los Adaes]], and its remains can still be seen. American historical research indicates that Canarian irrigation practices in the San Antonio colonial period can only be understood in the context of traditional irrigation practices developed over thousands of years by the settlers' ancestors in the Canary Islands.&lt;ref name="Piqué2006" /&gt;

By June 1730, twenty-five families had reached Cuba and ten families had been sent on to [[Veracruz]] before orders from Spain arrived to stop the movement. Most of these Canarians were from [[Lanzarote]], [[Tenerife]] and [[Gran Canaria]]. Under the leadership of [[Juan Leal Goraz]], the group marched overland to the [[Presidio San Antonio de Bexar]].

[[Image:Spanish Military Governors Palace.JPG|thumb|[[Presidio San Antonio de Bexar]], [[San Antonio]] ([[Texas]]).]]

The party had increased by marriages on the way to fifteen families, a total of fifty-six persons. They joined a military community that had been in existence since 1718. At eleven o'clock in the morning on March 9, 1731, sixteen Spanish families (56 people), often referred to as the "Canary Islanders," or "Isleños", arrived at the Presidio of San Antonio de Bexar in the Province of Texas. These settlers formed the nucleus of the village of San Fernando de Béxar, and established the first regularly organized civil government in Texas.&lt;ref name="rootsweb"/&gt;

[[Juan de Acuña, 2nd Marquis of Casa Fuerte|Juan de Acuña]], [[Viceroy]] of [[New Spain]], bestowed titles of nobility on each Canary Island family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poblar.com/Rodriguez/Granting%20of%20Titles.htm|title=Title of nobility given to the male Canary Islanders of San Antonio, Texas, and their descendants in perpetuum - November 28, l730|publisher=Poblar.com|date=|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving in San Antonio, the Isleños had problems with the Texas government and the local bourgeoisie. The Franciscan friars were opposed to their founding a town so near their area of influence. The Canarians competed with them in raising crops and livestock, and their success threatened the order's own production, which had increased dramatically with the labor of Native American converts to Catholicism. The missionaries demanded that the settlers be distributed evenly among all the missions in the territory. Juan Leal, mayor of the city, refused the friars' request and decided in favor of the Canarians.

The Isleños had no access to water from the [[San Antonio River]] for irrigating the land they farmed, as it was reserved for use by the missions. The stream of San Pedro had been used by the Canarians of San Antonio since their arrival, but in 1732 the Cabildo wrote to the Viceroy stating that the volume of water was not enough to irrigate their fields and their crops were dying. In response, the Viceroy suggested in his order that the waters of San Antonio be divided proportionately between the missions and the settlers. An official inspection found that the water flow was plentiful enough to supply the missions and the villa. The tension between the missions and the settlers continued for some time, and later focused on land grant issues as well as irrigation.&lt;ref name="Piqué2006" /&gt;

Fourteen years after the founding of San Antonio, the non-Isleño settlers complained that the stranglehold the Canarians had on local politics was tightening to the point of depriving them of water for their homes. In 1736, the first canal was dug to distribute the waters of the [[San Antonio River]] for irrigation. [[Antonio Rodríguez Medero]] and Governor [[Carlos Benites Franquis de Lugo]] had a part in passing legislation enabling development of an irrigation system for the settlers.&lt;ref name="Piqué2006" /&gt; The Isleños irrigated their farms using the age-old techniques of their homeland.&lt;ref name="Canarias y América"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gevic.net/info/contenidos/mostrar_contenidos.php?idcat=1&amp;idcap=186&amp;idcon=671|title=La presencia canaria en la conquista americana|trans-title=The Canary Island presence in the American conquest|language=es|work=Gran Canary Island Virtual Encyclopedia|accessdate=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their irrigation problems were resolved for a while with the construction of the Acequia de San Pedro, completed in 1741, but as their water supplies decreased, Alvarez Travieso, in his position as Alguacil Mayor, was compelled to initiate several lawsuits from 1756 to 1771, until the Isleños were allowed full access to land ownership and water rights.&lt;ref name="odisea canaria"&gt;Balbuena Castellano, José Manuel. "La odisea de los canarios en Texas y Luisiana" (The Odyssey of the Canarians in Texas and Louisiana). Page 46; (ed) 2007,editorial: Anroart Ediciones.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canarians had to compete not only with the missions, but also new Spanish and Mexican settlers arriving in San Antonio in the second half of the 18th century, who felt marginalized because appointments to positions in the [[Cabildo Canaries|Cabildo]], which had been created by the Canarians, were monopolized by them.

[[File:AlamoMemorial-5478.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to the Alamo defenders]]
San Antonio grew to become the largest Spanish settlement in Texas, and for most of its history it was the capital of the Spanish and later the Mexican province of Tejas. From San Antonio, the ''Camino Real'' (today Nacogdoches Road) in San Antonio ran to the Mexico–United States border near the small frontier town of [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]]. In the [[Battle of the Alamo]] fought from February 23 to March 6, 1836, the outnumbered Texan forces were ultimately defeated, and all of the Alamo's defenders were killed. There were Canary Islanders and Canarian descendants among these men, who were seen as martyrs for the cause of Texas freedom. "Remember the Alamo" became a rallying cry for the Texans' struggles to defeat Santa Anna's army.

There were a few descendants of Canary Islanders in San Antonio who joined the Mexican army to oppose Texas' independence from Mexico, such as the soldier and landowner [[Juan Moya]]. Other Isleños supported the annexation of Texas to the United States, and the territory decided to join the union in 1845.&lt;ref name="Tatum2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Tatum|title=Encyclopedia of Latino Culture: From Calaveras to Quinceañeras|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKiSAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|date=26 November 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-4408-0099-3|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last persons in the San Antonio Isleño community to speak Spanish as their daily language died in the 1950s, though the culture is being kept alive (San Antonio Isleños who speak Spanish are now all descendants of intermarriages between Isleños and Mexican settlers who arrived during the Mexican Revolution).{{fact|date=September 2017}}

Some 5,000 Isleños (the majority of them descendants of the original Canarian settlers) live in San Antonio, Texas.&lt;ref name="Díacanariosentexas"&gt;[http://www.eldia.es/2008-08-12/tenerife/tenerife331.htm El Día.

The ''Oficina Comercial Canaria'' (Canarian Commercial Office) of San Antonio is maintained by PROEXCA, a public company attached to the Canarian Ministry of Economy, Industry, Trade and Knowledge, that works to promote commercial cooperation between Canarian Spanish businessmen and the state of Texas. The ''Oficina de Canarias'' in San Antonio is an initiative of Canarian universities, university foundations and the previously mentioned Friends of the Canary Islands.&lt;ref name="odisea canaria"/&gt;

In 1539, [[Hernando de Soto]], funded in part by the Count of [[La Gomera]], recruited sailors in the Canary Islands to man expeditions for the exploration of [[Spanish Florida]]. In 1565, the newly appointed [[Adelantado]] of Florida, [[Pedro Menendez de Aviles]], organized two separate ''armadas'', totaling more than twenty ships, which sailed from Asturias and Cádiz to the [[Canary Islands]] before continuing on to attack the French at [[Fort Caroline]].&lt;ref name="McGrath2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=John T.

[[Lieutenant General]] [[Antonio de Benavides]], a native of [[Tenerife]], was appointed governor of La Florida in 1718 and governed there until 1734. On several occasions he repelled the English who were trying to conquer Florida by land and sea, and suppressed pirate raids. He also managed to secure a peace treaty with the neighboring Native American tribal groups who had been inimical to the Spanish colony, and maintained friendly relations with them as long as he was governing the colony. Benavides defended the rights of the indigenous peoples, allowing no distinction between classes or persons, and consequently was respected by Native Americans and Spaniards in the ''presidio'' alike.&lt;ref name="ElhequeSalvoareyborbon"&gt;[http://gaceta.es/entrevistas/heroe-salvo-muerte-primer-rey-borbon-20112014-1140 El héroe que salvó de la muerte al primer Borbón] Spanish: (The Hero Who Saved the First Bourbon From Death), Jesus Villanueva interview.

In 1740, due to the depopulation of much of Florida, ''La Real Compañía de Comercio de La Habana'' (The Royal Society of Commerce of Havana), a monopolistic corporation that tried to encourage commercial traffic between Cuba and Florida,&lt;ref&gt;González 2005, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; was required by Spanish statutes to annually provide two vessels bringing 50 Canarian families to Florida to counter aggressive moves southward by English colonists to the north. For a decade Canarian families were sent to Florida at a rate of about fifty families per year. These were peasant families to which were provided seeds for one or two crops, animals, land and franchises for the export of agricultural products to ports north and south in Spanish America. Thus emigration was encouraged to the reportedly fertile lands.&lt;ref name="Piqué2006" /&gt;

Between 1757 and 1759, 121 families were sent to Florida (42 in 1757, 43 families several months after, and another 36 the following year).&lt;ref name="LáinezCanales2009" /&gt; In 1763, after its defeat by [[Great Britain]] in the [[Seven Years' War]], Spain was forced to cede Florida, causing most of its Spanish inhabitants to emigrate to Cuba, although a small Canarian community would be permanently established in the region, where they were considered innovators in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;González 2005, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Spanish journalists Fernando Martínez Laínez and Carlos Canales Torrres (who examined the Spanish history of the United States in his book ''Banderas lejanas: La exploración, conquista y defensa por España del territorio de los actuales Estados Unidos''), after the cession of Florida to Great Britain, many more Canarian families emigrated to Florida. In the 47 years of Canarian emigration to Florida, of the 2,350 who wanted the Spanish Crown retained there, only 984 families migrated, most of them heading to [[Venezuela]] and the Spanish [[Antilles]].&lt;ref name="LáinezCanales2009" /&gt; In 1783, Spain recovered Florida and some of the Canarian settlers from Saint Bernard also emigrated to [[West Florida]].&lt;ref name="odisea canaria"/&gt;

During those years, [[Vicente Sebastián Pintado]], the Canarian cartographer, engineer, soldier and Surveyor General of West Florida, who drew the "Pintado plan", a street map of [[Pensacola]] drawn in 1812, which included the position and size of the ''[[Solar (Spanish term)|solares]]'' on which to build the church and other public buildings.  He left a huge corpus of work consisting of maps and plans of streets, letters and documents vital to the complicated sale of land in Florida and Louisiana.&lt;ref name=" thelushiwormaps"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/luso/usflorida.html|title=United States (Florida-Georgia): The Luso-Hispanic World in Maps|publisher= Library of Congress|date=July 27, 2011|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 the Library of Congress in [[Washington, DC]] obtained the donation of the Pintado Collection work, a collection of about 1,500 documents stored in the Division of Manuscripts.&lt;ref name=" SebaPintPapers "&gt;[http://findingaids.loc.gov/db/search/xq/searchMfer02.xq?_id=loc.mss.eadmss.ms008036&amp;_faSection=overview&amp;_faSubsection=did&amp;_dmdid= Vicente Sebastián Pintado Papers (Library of Congress)].

Florida was ceded to the United States in 1819, again causing the emigration of almost the entire Spanish population to Cuba, although once again, a few Spaniards remained in Florida. There is a recent immigrant community of Canarian people and their descendants living in [[Miami]], within the greater Hispanic community. Many of these Canarians live there only temporarily for employment. The vice president of the council of Tenerife, José Manuel Bermúdez, estimated that more than 200,000 people from the Canary Islands live in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/05/22/cronicasdesdeeeuu/1242963615.html El Mundo: Miami, la octava isla canaria] (in English: Miami, the Eighth Canary Island).&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Florida has a Canarian association, the ''Hogar canario de Florida'' (Canarian Home of Florida), located in [[Coral Way, Miami, Florida|Coral Way, Miami]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/presidencia/AccionExterior/CanariasEnElExterior/EntidadesCanarias/ Gobierno de Canarias:  Listado de entidades canarias en el exterior] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126082849/http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/presidencia/AccionExterior/CanariasEnElExterior/EntidadesCanarias/# |date=2016-01-26 }} (in Spanish: List of Canarian entities abroad).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some communities in [[Southern California]] were also founded by Canary Islanders.&lt;ref name="Canarias y América"/&gt; Numbers of Canary Island colonists and their descendants were recorded in [[New Mexico]] during the Spanish era of that state.&lt;ref name="Piqué2006" /&gt;

== Culture ==
The Isleño communities in Louisiana have kept alive their Spanish musical folklore and Canarian ''[[romance (music)|romance]]'' ballads, [[décima]], and lyric songs of their ancestors. They also preserve in their oral traditions a wide variety of songs, nursery rhymes, riddles, proverbs, and folk tales, and still use common Isleño names for numerous animals, including birds, fish, and [[reptiles]], as well as [[insects]] and trees. Some Isleños still practice traditional Canarian folk medicine, prayer healing, and witchcraft rituals.&lt;ref name="Armistead1992"/&gt;

=== Language ===
The Canarian dialect is gradually disappearing in Texas and Louisiana. By 1984, researchers of Isleño communities in the southern United States had recorded 82 hours of native speakers sharing information about them: (57 hours by Isleños, 10 hours by Brulis, 10 hours by speakers in Texas and 5 hours by Adaeseños from Los Adaes). In the case of the Brulis, Adaeseños and speakers in Texas, the material is mostly linguistic. On the other hand, interviews with the Isleños bear witness to a rich diversity of language samples, folk and popular literature. These communities have a wide variety of songs, nursery rhymes, riddles, proverbs, folk tales, folk medicine, prayer healing, witchcraft traditions and many Isleño names for birds, fish, reptiles, insects and trees.&lt;ref name="Armistead1992"/&gt; San Antonio Isleños now speak a Mexican dialect of Spanish as they are mostly the descendants of intermarriages between Isleños and Mexican settlers who arrived during the Mexican Revolution.

''The Spanish Tradition in Louisiana'', a scholarly book written by Samuel G. Armistead, with musical transcriptions and information gathered from this recorded material, was published to ensure their preservation over time. This Isleño material relates not only to the Canary Islands, but also to several other regions of Spain, as immigrants from these places have been coming to Louisiana since the 19th century and mixing with the Isleño communities.&lt;ref&gt;Armistead 1992, pp. xiii-xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Isleños travel to the Canary Islands every year to remember their roots and keep in touch with the land of their ancestors. In 1980, the Saint Bernard Isleño community built the Isleños Museum to preserve the local Canarian culture. It was badly damaged by Hurricane Katrina and demolished, but has since been completely restored and reopened .&lt;ref name="Museo de los Isleños"&gt;[http://www.losislenos.org/museum.html St. Bernard Isleños.

A '''concurrent majority''', in [[US history]], was a constitutional rule proposed to enable minorities to block the actions of majorities. In the [[United States]], its most vocal proponents have tended to be minority groups, such as farmers in an urban-majority society or slaveowning Southerners protesting national policies that encroached on their privileges and interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dreams of a More Perfect Union|last = Kersh|first = Rogan|publisher = Cornell University Press|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Ithaca and New York|pages = 141–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concurrent majority was intended to prevent the [[tyranny of the majority]] that proponents feared might arise in an unlimited [[democracy]].

==Background==
Prior to the [[American Revolution]], most governments were controlled by small minorities of ruling élites. Most of the population was completely [[enfranchisement|disfranchised]], even in countries like [[Switzerland]] whose governments (local, regional, and federal) were democratic by contemporary standards. The conception of government that materialized during the separation of the United States from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] marked a movement away from such control towards wider suffrage. The problem of tyranny then became a problem of limiting the majority's power.

==US Constitution==
Even so, the widening of the franchise caused concern. The framers of the [[US Constitution]], even while they reiterated that the people held national [[sovereignty]], worked to ensure that a simple majority of voters could not infringe upon the [[liberty]] of the rest of the people. One protection was [[separation of powers]], such as [[bicameralism]] in the [[US Congress]] and the three branches of the national government: legislative, executive, and judicial.

Having two houses was intended to serve as a brake on popular movements that might threaten particular groups, with the [[US House of Representatives]] representing the common people and the [[US Senate]] defending the interests of the state governments. The House was to be elected by popular vote, and the Senate was to be chosen by state legislatures. The executive veto and the implied power of [[judicial review]], which was later made explicit by the [[US Supreme Court]], created further obstacles to absolute majority rule.

Furthermore, the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], more familiarly known at the time as the "federal ratio," allowed slaves to count as three fifths of free men for the purposes of representation and taxation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Negro President: Jefferson and the Slave Power|last = Wills|first = Garry|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = xv-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compromise secured Southern votes for ratification of the Constitution and ensured disproportionate influence to Southerners for the first 50 years of the Constitution's history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Calhoun and nullification==
During the first half of the 19th century, [[John C. Calhoun]] of [[South Carolina]] revived and expounded upon the concurrent majority doctrine. An ardent advocate of [[states' rights]], he served as [[vice president of the United States|vice president]] and senator.

He noted that the [[Northern United States|North]], with its industrial economy, had become far more populous than the [[Southern United States|South]]. As the South's dependence on slavery sharply differentiated its agricultural economy from the North's, the difference in power afforded by population threatened interests that Calhoun considered essential to the South.

However, national policy became more and more driven on expansion and developing internal markets and infrastructure. With such changes, the South perceived more and more risks to its position and Calhoun became the most strident spokesman for sectionalism of his region.

His theory of the "concurrent majority," elaborated in his posthumous work of political theory ''[[A Disquisition on Government]]'' (1851),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = John C. Calhoun: Disquisition on Government|url = http://www.constitution.org/jcc/disq_gov.htm|accessdate = 2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued a method for protecting voting minorities from the tyranny of the majority, but his position on nullification argued the importance of protecting his region from high tariffs, essential for its export-focused economy. In life, Calhoun had been a leading proponent of the concept of [[nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]], as he most forcefully articulated in the 1828 ''[[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]]'', which was published anonymously while he was vice president, in response to the protectionist [[Tariff of 1828]], also called the "Tariff of Abominations."

Nullification, an outgrowth of Jeffersonian [[compact theory]], held that any state, as part of its rights as sovereign parties to the Constitution, had the power to declare specific federal laws void within its borders if it considered the law to be unconstitutional. Therefore, under Calhoun's schema, a law required two forms of majorities: a majority of the federal legislature and a concurrent majority of the legislatures of each state. It was on that authority in 1832 that South Carolina passed the [[Ordinance of Nullification]] on the Tariff of 1828 and its successor, the [[Tariff of 1832]], thus beginning the [[Nullification Crisis]]. [[Andrew Jackson]] responded with the [[Force Bill]], but armed conflict was avoided after the [[Tariff of 1833]] was passed, the compromise being largely the work of Calhoun.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20415">[[Image:Gebel el-Arak knife mp3h8791.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]].  The reverse of the handle shows a [[Master of Animals]] motif: two confronted lions, flanking a central figure (note confronted dogs and other animals below)]]
'''Confronted animals''', or '''confronted-animal''' as an [[adjective]], where two animals face each other in a [[symmetry|symmetrical]] pose, is an ancient bilateral [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in [[art]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] studied in [[archaeology]] and [[art history]]. The "anti-confronted animals" is the opposing motif, with the animals back to back.

Bilateral symmetry is a dominant aspect of our world and strong representation of it with matching figures often creates a balance that is appealing in artwork.

In ancient art, confronted-animal motifs often involve the [[Master of Animals]], a central human figure between two confronted animals, often grasping them, and are probably part of a unified [[sociology|socio-]][[culture|cultural]] motif. A related motif in ancient art is known as the [[Mistress of Animals]].

It is thought that the [[iconography]] sometimes has [[ritual]] and religious associations; for example, the Lion Gate of [[Mycenae]] has a column between the protective, surmounted and confronted lionesses standing with two feet on the ground and two on the same base on which the column rests. The column is thought to represent a goddess, abstracted to avoid [[taboo]]ed direct representation.  Alternatively, the column has also been interpreted as symbolizing the entrance to the palace.  The lions are thus guarding the entrance to the palace and the walled fortification simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/4306/1/The_Lion_Gate_Relief.pdf|title=The Lion Gate Relief at Mycenae Reconsidered (PDF)|last=Shaw|first=Maria C.|date=1986|website=TSpace (University of Toronto), Archaeological Society of Athens, Greece|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif called the [[Tree of Life]], where two confronted animals graze on a shrub or tree, is also very ancient.

==Gebel el-Arak Knife==

The reverse side of the [[Gebel el-Arak Knife]] handle, displayed at the top of the article, shows two powerful confronted lions, separated by a figure who is grasping them. Of note, the knob on the reverse shows the top end of the hole for a cord or rope, on the suspension [[lug (knob)|lug]]; this knife may have been worn around the neck ceremonially.

==Examples from archaeology==

===Cylinder seals===

[[Image:Uruk3000BCE.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Cylinder seal]] of [[Uruk]] displaying a confronted-lioness motif sometimes described as a ''"[[serpopard]]"'' - 3000 BC - [[Louvre]]]]
Examples of confronted animals exist on [[Cylinder seal]]s from [[Mesopotamia]]. [[deity|Deities]], or [[hero]]es grasping lionesses, cattle, [[griffin]]s, or other, imaginary creatures are sometimes found.

Many cylinder seals involving confronted [[goat]]s surrounding a central [[Tree of life]] on a 'cone' or 'mountain' platform share one common theme. Others may be thought of as deities holding the animals under their control.

Because cylinder seals are numerous and also come from [[prehistory|pre-historical]] periods, back to the [[4th millennium BC|fourth]] or [[5th millennium BC]], themes are varied. Another Tree of life type of confronted animals cylinder seal has a "hero grasping water buffalo" and a "bull-man grasping lions", each between the animals; again, the central figure is the "Tree-of-Life" that often is interpreted as representing a goddess.

===Confronted snakes===
[[Image:Snake Goddess Crete 1600BC.jpg|thumb|Figure from [[Crete]], holding confronted snakes, dated 1600 BC. ]]
Confronted [[serpent (symbolism)|snake]]s are frequent images in many cultures from ancient times to historical periods. Often associated with religious ceremonies and deities, perhaps the most familiar figure known popularly from ancient times is the deity or priestess of Crete depicted holding up two confronted snakes on either side of her.

A [[chlorite]] vessel [http://www.nyu.edu/classes/wright/Fall03/ChloriteVase2.jpg] from the area of contemporary [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] is displayed at this link. It depicts three pairs of confronted animals. Two confronted [[snakes]] are being held in the hands of the central figure; below the snake-pair are a pair of ''anti-confronted-lionesses'' (although they turn their heads to face each other their hind quarters are closely confronted), recumbent. The third similar pair of animals on this item are two anti-confronted bovines with a human or deity between also. Two tumbling lions and other animals are depicted to the right.

===Narmer Palette===
[[File:Narmer Palette serpopard side.jpg|thumb|left|Narmer Palette with confronted lionesses, displayed in iconographic [[register (sculpture)|register]]s - ''Ancient Egypt c. 3,000 BC'']]
The [[Narmer Palette]], used to mix cosmetics in the receptacle on one side, has two confronted [[Felidae|felines]], sometimes called [[serpopard]]s (because of their exaggerated long necks which look snakelike to some researchers) forming the receptacle. Close examination of the animals with the exaggerated, long necks supports identification as [[lion]]esses. The entire theme of the Narmer Palette, is about the [[pharaoh]] of the newly unified [[Ancient Egypt]] represented in two scenes, (palette ''obverse'', palette ''reverse''). On one side the pharaoh wears the crown of [[Upper Egypt]] and on the other, the pharaoh wears the crown of [[Lower Egypt]]. Thus, it is thought that the lionesses with their intertwining necks are representing two kingdoms, once separate, but now unified under one pharaoh. The lioness [[Bastet|Bast]] had been the protective deity of one kingdom and the lioness [[Sekhmet]] of the other kingdom, equally important deities in each of the early [[Egyptian pantheon]]s. Respectively, they were the special protectors of the pharaoh in each kingdom, who persisted as deities throughout the long history of unified [[Ancient Egypt]]. Eventually their roles diverged, however, with one becoming less of the protector and warrior deity and assigned other roles. Typically, many similar deities in the two kingdoms soon were merged, so the retention of both is thought to be the result of the long and strong tradition of each.

Examples of other confronted animals exist on many [[cosmetic palette]]s of Ancient Egypt that have been discovered.  One palette has confronted-[[hippopotamus]]es; others include giraffes, geese, and other animals familiar to the Egyptians. Bilaterally depicted [[palm tree]]s also are known as well on palettes.

===Mycenae Lion Gate===
[[Image:Mycenae lion gate detail dsc06384.jpg|thumb|225px|The Mycenae "Lion Gate" (detail) with two [[lion]]esses or lions that flank a central column|alt=]]
The gate to the citadel of [[Mycenae]] is shown to the right. It crowned the major entrance gateway to the ancient citadel that was the centre of the culture, [[Mycenaean Greece]], that predated that of [[Greece]], and is a well-known example of two confronted lionesses. Debate exists in research of this image, questioning whether these are leopards or lionesses confronted with a column between them that represents the deity, but the characteristic tufts at the end of the tails confirm the species. Many images of lioness related deities are depicted with heavier manes than typical for lionesses, but that may have been the result of attempts to interpretation of the species or, unfamiliarity with the atypical [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] differences within this feline species.  Alternatively, George Mylonas believed lions were depicted, not lionesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mycenae and the Mycenaean Age|last=Mylonas|first=George|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1966|isbn=978-0691035239|location=|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greek herald's staffs (kerykeia)===

In ancient Greece, heralds functioning as private messengers or public criers were referred to as ''kerykes''. The ''keryx'' has functions in political, military, judicional and religious matters. He was identified by his attribute, the herald's staff or ''kerykeion'', in Latin ''caduceus''. The attribute also offered him protection. Hermes, the messenger of the gods, also carries a ''kerykeion''. Kerykeia were often donated to temples by private persons and on state occasions. They are also found in herald's graves, and identify the profession of the buried person.

{{Main|Tomb of the Leopards}}
Confronted leopards appear in a tomb found in Tarchuna ([[Tarquinia]]), or Tarchna Tarchnal, the chief of the [[Etruscan cities|twelve cities]] of [[Etruria]], a district in what is described as the [[Etruscan civilization]] that existed in Italy from 1200 BC through the 100 BC. It appears in the earliest history of [[Rome]], which was dominated by it until early in the 330s BC. This mural features confronted [[leopard]]s providing protection for a banquet in the afterlife. Frequently felines, lionesses and leopards such as these are confronted with a tree, shrub, or column between them in murals from this culture. The Etruscans are thought to have migrated from the area of Troy,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} through Greece where they absorbed many cultural elements, to Italy where they founded their culture in prehistoric times.

In Europe, confronted animals are an important motif in [[animal style]], or [[zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] decoration, [[Insular art]], and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]. In these contexts there may be little or nothing between the two animals, and the emphasis is on the pair themselves.  Human figures are often treated in the same way, often mixed in with animals in decorative schemes - [[Archery|archer]]s were especially popular in the Romanesque period.

The early [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[ship burial]] found in contemporary Great Britain at [[Sutton Hoo]], from the seventh century AD, contains famous examples of [[Migration Period art]].  The [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid]] has three stylized confronted-animal pairs; the two side pairs, left and right, are identical, and have the animals in the person's clutched grasp. The central confronted animals are even more complex in theme.

Opposed animals are used in [[Insular art]], the style of which is derived from a mixture of [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and northern European design traditions. Confronted animals, or animals intertwined in very intricate patterns, often depicted grabbing at each other to form the "gripping beast" pattern, are a main feature of some periods of [[Viking art]]. So intertwined are the animals, they are dissolved into pure ornament, and the individuals are barely discernable from each other.  Confronted animals are also frequently seen in European [[Romanesque art]], for example as decorative patterns in [[Romanesque architecture]].

[[Supporters (heraldry)|Supporters]] in [[heraldry]], not always a matched pair, continue the theme.

===Asian art===

====Luristan bronzes, Anatolian "animal" carpets====
{{See also|Early Anatolian Animal carpets|Luristan bronze}}

Confronted-animal motifs are found extensively in Asian art and in textiles, including [[Oriental rug|rug]]s, across [[Eurasia]].

Few examples still exist of a special type of Oriental [[Oriental rug|carpet]], termed "animal carpets" because their main feature are confronted animals. Dated to the 13th–16th century, they represent carpets woven during the transition period between the late [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuq]] and the early [[Ottoman empire]]. Parallels were shown between the "opposed animal" and "latch-hook" motifs from woven pile rugs and the [[Lorestān bronze]]s.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal rugs - Nomadic and Village Weavings from the Near East and Central Asia|date=1992|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=1-85669-025-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are [[Early Iron Age]] [[bronze]] artifacts of various individual forms which have been recovered from [[Lorestān Province|Lorestān]] and [[Kermanshah]] areas in west-central [[Iran]].

Carpet fragments discovered in [[Konya]] and [[Beyşehir]] in Turkey, and [[Fustat|Fostat]] in Egypt were dated to the 13th century, which corresponds to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=F.R.|title=A History of Oriental Carpets before 1800|date=1908|publisher=Printed for the author in the I. and R.

A traditional Chinese motif, the fight between phoenix and dragon, is seen in an Anatolian carpet now displayed at the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin, and radiocarbon dated to the mid 15th century. The Chinese motif was probably introduced into Islamic art by the Mongols during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="Dragon and Phoenix carpet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon and Phoenix Carpet|url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/database_item.php?id=object;ISL;de;Mus01;34;de|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another animal carpet showing two medallions with two birds besides a tree was found in the Swedish church of Marby.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"/&gt;

Since 1988, seven more carpets of the animal type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]]. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;ref name="MET animal carpet Acc.Nr. 1990.61"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/453317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which parallels a painting by the Sienese artist [[Gregorio di Cecco]]: "The Marriage of the Virgin", 1423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Gallery London|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/probably-by-gregorio-di-cecco-di-luca-the-marriage-of-the-virgin|website=National Gallery London NG 1317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows large confronted animals, each with a smaller animal inside. An almost complete animal carpet is now at the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]].

"Animal carpets" were also depicted in Italian paintings of the 14th and 15th century, and thus represent the earliest Oriental carpets shown in [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|Renaissance paintings]].

===Native North American Art===
[[File:Powhatan's mantle, lithography 1888.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of Powhatan's Mantle]]
"Powhatan's Mantle" is a cloak of [[deerskin]], which originally belonged to a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] of high social status. Its decoration consists of shell beadwork, depicting a central standing human figure flanked by two upright, opposed quadrupeds and surrounded by 34 discs. The two animals resemble one another in terms of their overall outline, but their tails and paws differ. The left-hand animal has a long tail and round paws with five articulated digits. The right-hand animal has a shorter tail, and its legs end in cloven hoofs. Historically, this artwork was believed to have belonged [[Powhatan]], who was the [[paramount chief]] of [[Tsenacommacah]], an [[Powhatan Paramount Chiefdom|alliance]] of [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian-speaking]] [[Virginia Indians]] in the [[Tidewater region of Virginia]] at the time English settlers landed at [[History of the Jamestown Settlement (1607–1699)|Jamestown]] in 1607. "Powhatan's Mantle" is one of the earliest North American artifacts to be collected by Europeans that still survives today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/amulets/tradescant/tradescant07-13.html "Powhatan's Mantle"] at the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kansas City Crossroads District (31507881750).jpg|thumb|Crossroads, Kansas City in December 2016]]
The '''Crossroads''' (officially the '''Crossroads Arts District''') is a historic [[neighborhood]] near [[Downtown Kansas City]], Missouri.  It is centered at approximately 19th Street and Baltimore Avenue, directly south of the [[Downtown freeway loop|Downtown Loop]] and north of [[Crown Center]]. It is the city's main [[art gallery]] district and center for the [[visual arts]]. Dozens of galleries are located in its renovated warehouses and industrial buildings. It is also home to numerous restaurants, [[housewares]] shops, [[architecture|architects]], [[interior design|designers]], an [[advertising agency]], and other visual artists. The district also has several [[live music]] venues.

Numerous buildings in the neighborhood are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], including the [[TWA Corporate Headquarters Building]], [[Western Auto Building]], and [[Firestone Building]]. There are two historic groups of buildings also on the Register—Working Class Hotels at 19th &amp; Main Streets (Midwest Hotel, Monroe Hotel, and Rieger Hotel) and Crossroads Historic Freight District (industrial buildings clustered along the tracks north of [[Union Station (Kansas City, Missouri)|Union Station]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.mo.gov/shpo/jackson.htm |title=Jackson County National Register Listings |publisher=Missouri Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=January 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228180815/http://dnr.mo.gov/shpo/jackson.htm |archivedate=December 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crossroads district is also home to one of the county's largest remaining{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} examples of a Film Row district. The Film Row district consists of 17 buildings.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Following the demolition of a Film Row building, the Film Row district was placed on Missouri Preservation's 2013 list of "watched properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://preservemo.org/places-in-peril/2013-2/|title=Missouri’s Most Endangered 2013|date=2015-02-20|work=The Missouri Alliance for Historic Preservation|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' and ''[[The Pitch (newspaper)|The Pitch]]'' maintain offices in the neighborhood, along with [[HOK (firm)|HOK]] and [[Barkley Inc.|Barkley]]. The [[Belger Arts Center]] is also located in the district.

==First Fridays==
{{advert|section|date=August 2018}}
Art galleries generally open new shows on the first Friday of each month from 6 to 9 pm. This has become one of the region's most popular regular events as thousands of people flock to the Crossroads for gallery "open houses" amidst the Crossroads's unique atmosphere.

There are more than 60 galleries in the Crossroads district, making it one of the five largest arts districts in the US.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Crossroads Music Festival==
First held in late August 2005, the Crossroads Music Festival is an annual event organized by [http://www.spiceoflifeproductions.com Spice of Life Productions], which features local music artists. The 2005 event was held at Grinder's Sculpture Park (CrossroadsKC) at 18th Street and Locust Street. In addition to concert performances, offerings include [[short film]]s by local [[independent film]]makers and booths offering apparel by local designers, local independent print media, and [[carnival]] games.

==Tax abatements==
In 2007, one of Kansas City's development agencies began a program to allow property tax abatements for art-related business who would otherwise be priced out of the neighborhood by fast-rising property values. Neighborhood leaders lobbied for the program to prevent the "Soho Effect" of gentrification. Tax abatements had been granted to developers to attract new residents to the neighborhood with high-end condominiums and lofts next to the galleries.

'''David Hartley''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɑr|t|l|i}}; 8 August&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/256165/David-Hartley David Hartley - Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; 1705{{snd}}28 August 1757) was an [[English (people)|English]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] and founder of the [[Associationism|Associationist]] school of [[psychology]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Early life and education==
David Hartley was born in 1705 in the vicinity of [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[Yorkshire]]. His mother died three months after his birth. His father, an Anglican clergyman, died when David was only fifteen. He was educated at [[Bradford Grammar School]] and [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], of which society he became a fellow in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=HRTY722D|name=Hartley, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended for the Church, he was deterred from taking orders by certain scruples as to signing the [[Thirty-nine Articles]], and took up the study of [[medicine]]. Nevertheless, he remained a member of the [[Church of England]], and was on intimate terms with the most distinguished churchmen of his day. He considered it his duty to obey ecclesiastical as well as civil authorities. The doctrine to which he most strongly objected was that of eternal punishment.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Hartley, David|volume=13|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career and family history==
Hartley was married twice. The first time in 1730 to Alice Rowley, who died the next year giving birth to their son [[David Hartley (the Younger)|David]] (1731–1813). His second marriage was in 1735 to Elizabeth (1713–78), the daughter of [[Robert Packer]] of [[Shellingford]] and [[Bucklebury]], both in [[Berkshire]]. This marriage was undertaken in spite of the opposition of Elizabeth's influential and very wealthy family. This union produced two additional children, Mary (1736–1803) and [[Winchcombe Henry Hartley|Winchcombe Henry]] (1740–94). Hartley practised as a physician at [[Newark, England|Newark]], [[Bury St Edmunds]], [[London]], and lastly at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], where he died in 1757.

He was a [[vegetarian]].&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece, ''Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought'', University of British Columbia Press, 2009, pp. 207–209.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1736.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=1&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27hartley%27%29| title= Library and Archive catalogue| publisher= Royal Society| accessdate= 2012-03-09}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations on Man==
{{Main|Observations on Man}}
[[File:HartleyObservations.png|left|thumb|Title page from the first edition of the ''Observations'']]
His principal work ''Observations on Man, his Frame, his Duty, and his Expectations'' was published in 1749, three years after [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]]'s ''Essai sur l'origine des connaissances humaines'', in which similar theories were expounded. It is in two parts—the first dealing with the frame of the human body and mind, and their mutual connections and influences, the second with the duty and expectations of mankind. His two main theories are the doctrine of vibrations and the doctrine of associations. His physical theory, he tells us, was drawn from certain speculations as to nervous action which [[Isaac Newton]] had published in his ''Principia''. His psychological theory was suggested by the ''Dissertation concerning the Fundamental Principles of Virtue or Morality'', which was written by a clergyman named John Gay (1699—1745), and prefixed by Bishop Law to his translation of [[Archbishop King]]'s [[Latin]] work on the ''Origin of Evil'', its chief object being to show that sympathy and conscience are developments by means of association from the selfish feelings.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

This work also contained thoughts on [[Christian apologetics]] and theology that were published under the title ''Of the Truth of the Christian Religion''.,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=Sws8AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Of%20the%20truth%20of%20the%20Christian%20religion%22&amp;f=false Of the Truth of Christian Religion]'', Chapter II of ''Observations on Man: His Frame, His Duty and His Expectations''&lt;/ref&gt; which included proofs on the [[existence of God]], a defense of the divine authority of the [[Bible]], remarks on the eternity of God's existence, on the infinity and [[immateriality]] of God, on [[free-will]], miracles, and the terms of religious salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Archive. ''[https://archive.org/stream/observationsonma03hartiala#page/xx/mode/2up Observations on man, his frame, his duty, and his expectations]'' (1801), 3rd edition - See Contents&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hartley's theories==
The outlines of Hartley's theory are as follows. Like [[John Locke]], he asserted that, prior to sensation, the human mind is a blank slate. By a growth from simple sensations, those states of consciousness which appear most remote from sensation come into being. And the one law of growth of which Hartley took account was the law of contiguity, synchronous and successive. By this law he sought to explain, not only the phenomena of memory, which others had similarly explained before him, but also the phenomena of emotion, of reasoning, and of voluntary and involuntary action (see [[Association of Ideas]]).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; A friend, associate, and one of his chief advocates, was [[Joseph Priestley]] (1733–1804), the discoverer of oxygen. Priestley was one of the foremost scientists of his age.

=== Doctrine of vibrations===
Hartley's physical theory gave birth to the modern study of the intimate connection of physiological and psychical facts. He believed that sensation is the result of a vibration of the minute particles of the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]]ry substance of the nerves, to account for which he postulated, with Newton, a subtle elastic [[Aether (classical element)|ether]], rare in the interstices of solid bodies and in their close neighbourhood, and denser as it recedes from them. Pleasure is the result of moderate vibrations, pain of vibrations so violent as to break the continuity of the nerves. These vibrations leave behind them in the brain a tendency to fainter vibrations or "vibratiuncles" of a similar kind, which correspond to "ideas of sensation." This accounts for memory.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

=== Doctrine of associations ===
The course of reminiscence and of the thoughts generally, when not immediately dependent upon external sensation, is accounted for by the idea that there are always vibrations in the brain on account of its heat and the pulsation of its arteries. The nature of these vibrations is determined by each man's past experience, and by the circumstances of the moment, which causes one or another tendency to prevail over the rest. Sensations which are often associated together become each associated with the ideas corresponding to the others; and the ideas corresponding to the associated sensations become associated together, sometimes so intimately that they form what appears to be a new simple idea, not without careful analysis resolvable into its component parts.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

=== Free will ===
Starting from a detailed account of the phenomena of the senses, Hartley tried to show how, by the above laws, all the emotions, which he analyses with considerable skill, may be explained. [[John Locke|Locke]]'s phrase "association of ideas" is employed throughout, "idea" being taken as including every mental state but sensation. He emphatically asserts the existence of pure disinterested sentiment, while declaring it to be a growth from the self-regarding feelings. Voluntary action is explained as the result of a firm connexion between a motion and a sensation or "idea," and, on the physical side, between an "ideal" and a motory vibration. Therefore, in the Freewill controversy Hartley took his place as a determinist. It was only with reluctance, and when his speculations were nearly complete, that he came to a conclusion on this subject in accordance with his theory.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Note the tongue-in-cheek reference to "[[tubal-cain|Tubal Cain]]", who was said to be the first blacksmith (Genesis 4:19-24)]]

The '''Dorchester Pot''' was a metal vase-like object that was recovered in two pieces after an explosion used to break up rock at [[Meeting House Hill]], in [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1852. According to text reprinted from the ''Boston Transcript'', a local paper, in the June 5, 1852 ''[[Scientific American]]'',&lt;ref name="Anonymous1852a"/&gt; the two pieces were found, loose among debris thrown out by the explosion. Apparently, it was inferred from the locations of the two pieces of this pot among the explosion debris that this pot had been blasted from solid [[Puddingstone (rock)|puddingstone]] ([[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]]), which is part of the [[Roxbury Conglomerate]], from about 10 feet below the surface&lt;ref name="OOPart"&gt;{{cite web|title=OOPArt? The Dorchester Pot|url=http://irna.lautre.net/OOPArt-The-Dorchester-Pot.html|website=Le site d’Irna|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Meeting House Hill. The story has been used by creationists and fringe theorists as evidence that conventional models of geology or the length of the human presence on earth are wrong. Mainstream commentators identify it as a Victorian era candlestick or pipe holder.

==Geological context==
The Roxbury Conglomerate, from which this pot is alleged to have come, has been dated as having accumulated between 570 and 593 million years ago and during the [[Ediacaran]] Period.&lt;ref name="Thompson+2007a"&gt;Thompson, M.D., A.M. Grunow, and J. Ramezum, 2007, ''Late Neoproterozoic paleogeography of the Southeastern New England Avalon Zone: Insights from U-Pb geochronology and paleomagnetism.''

Geological Society, London, England.&lt;/ref&gt; Metamorphism has significantly altered the Roxbury Conglomerate to sub-[[greenschist]] facies and created within it a well-developed and closely spaced [[slate|slaty]] [[Cleavage (geology)|cleavage]] that is oriented approximately perpendicular to bedding. Tectonism has also flattened, stretched, indented, and fractured the pebbles and associated matrix of the Roxbury Conglomerate to the point that it often has the appearance of flow structure.&lt;ref name="CartoOthers2011a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mansfield1906a"&gt;Mansfield, G. R., 1906, ''The Origin and Structure of the Roxbury Conglomerate.'' Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College. no. XLIX, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==The pot==
The bell-shaped vessel was described as being about 4.5&amp;nbsp;inches (11.5&amp;nbsp;cm) high, 6.5&amp;nbsp;inches (16.5&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter at the base and 2.5&amp;nbsp;inches (6.4&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter at the top. The body of this object was said to resemble [[zinc]] alloyed with [[silver]] in color. Its description said that "On the sides there are six figures of a flower, or bouquet, beautifully inlaid with pure silver, and around the lower part of the vessel a vine, or wreath, inlaid also with silver.&lt;ref name="Anonymous1852a"/&gt; The primary source&lt;ref name="Anonymous1852a"/&gt; of information about this object, provides neither any picture of nor age estimate for the Dorchester Pot.

==Fringe theories==

The Dorchester Pot is often discussed as an [[out-of-place artifact]] by various popular books and articles about unsolved mysteries, alternative science, and different types of [[creationism]]. As part of a short description, an image purporting to be of the Dorchester Pot appears on page 46 of the 1985 Reader's Digest Association book ''Mysteries of the Unexplained''.&lt;ref name="Marshall+1982a"&gt;Marshall, W., M. Dvais, V. Mollman, and G. Zappler (1985) ''Mysteries of the Unexplained.'' Pleasantville, New York, Reader's Digest Association, Inc. 320 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-89577-146-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not provide any estimate of the age of the Dorchester Pot. The source that they credit for their photograph of the Dorchester Pot is [[Brad Steiger]]'s ''Worlds Before Our Own''.&lt;ref name="Steiger+1979a"&gt;Steiger, B. (1979) ''Worlds Before Our Own.'' New York, New York, Berkley Publishing Group. 236 p. {{ISBN|978-1-933665-19-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photograph is also used in the [[Falun Gong]] website "PureInsight", which provides without any explanation an age of 100,000 years for this artifact.&lt;ref name="Pureinsight2006a"&gt;PureInsight, 2006. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070919193928/http://www.pureinsight.org/pi/index.php?news=1899 ''Zhengjian Book Series: "Removing the Veil from Prehistoric Civilizations" -- Chapter 3: Prehistoric Smelting Technologies and Mining Activities''] Translated from [http://www.zhengjian.org/zj/articles/2003/3/19/20890.html 《揭开史前文明的面纱》连载(三)：史前人类的金属技术与采矿活动 ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Cremo]], a well-known Hindu creationist, claims that the Dorchester Pot is evidence for the "presence of artistic metal workers in North America over 600 million years ago."&lt;ref name="Cremo +1998a"&gt;Cremo, M.A., and R.L. Thompson (1998) ''Forbidden Archeology: The Hidden History of the Human Race.'' Badger, California, Bhaktivedanta Book Publishing. 914 p. {{ISBN|978-0-89213-294-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Young Earth creationists regard the Dorchester Pot as having been manufactured by an ancient civilization that predated the Noachian Flood.

==Mainstream views==
[[File:Poggiapipe indiano.jpg|thumb|19th-century pipe holder from India, Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya]]
Mainstream archaeologists argue that the Dorchester Pot is neither Ediacaran in age nor even from an ancient, lost civilization. They identify it as being a recognizable historic artifact.

Archaeologists Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews and James Doeser, whose website ''Bad Archaeology'' examines fringe archaeology, state that "it is difficult to understand why anyone might take this report seriously" and also identifies the object as "clearly a candlestick of obviously Victorian style... why would anyone in 1852 believe that it was more than a few years old?"&lt;ref name="BadArchaeology2007a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badarchaeology.com/out-of-place-artefacts/very-ancient-artefacts/metallic-vase-from-dorchester-massachusetts/|title=Metallic vase from Dorchester, Massachusetts|work=Bad Archaeology|date=19 August 2007|author=Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1964,&lt;ref name="Catalano1964a"&gt;Catalano, B. (1964) ''Arte Indiana'' Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, K. Bharatha Iyer, Italy, fig 81, 142 p.&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian [[debunker]] Biagio Catalano argued that the "vase" was actually almost identical, as in both shape and decorations, to an Indian pipe-holder stored at the Prince of Wales Museum (now known as [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya]]) in [[Mumbai|Bombay]].

'''El Conde''' is an archeological site located at Ozumba Street, El Conde, three block north the Mayo 1 Ave., in the municipality of [[Naucalpan]],&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal |last= García Chávez |first=Raúl E. |date=  |title= Zona arqueológica El conde |trans-title=El Conde archaeological site |journal= INAH|location=Mexico|url=http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za00909.html |language=Spanish |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Mexico State.

The site was formally declared a prehispanic historical monument on December 28, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=   |last=  |title= Decreto declaración de El Conde como monumento arqueológico  |url=  http://sic.conaculta.gob.mx/documentos/756.pdf |publisher=Conaculta  |location=Mexico |language= Spanish|trans-title=Decree of declaration of El Conde as an archaeological monument |date=Dec 28, 2001 |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Valley of Mexico, of which Naucalpan is part of, was inhabited by humans for over 20,000 years.&lt;ref name= Enciclopedia  /&gt;

Naucalpan's history begins with a group from the [[Tlatilco culture]]&lt;ref&gt;Nahuatl name that means "hidden on the ground ". The name was assigned by Nahuatlaca peoples, being that when the Nahuatlacas arrived at the Valley of Mexico, the Tlatilco culture had already disappeared. It is believed that the city was dominated (or strongly influenced) by the [[Olmec]]s (the first great [[Mesoamerica]]n Culture).&lt;/ref&gt; It settled the banks of the “Río Hondo” between 1700 and 600 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Dates from Diehl (2004), Bradley and Joralemon (1993). Were calculated by [[Radiocarbon dating]]. According to Pool (2007: 7), the Tlatilco culture developed between 1450 and 900 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; in the area of the current Naucalpan municipality.

Tlatilco archaeological evidence reveal the social development of that culture, prior to the Teotihuacan, Toltec, Chichimeca, and certainly the Aztec.&lt;ref name= Enciclopedia/&gt;
In the Mesoamerican Preclassical period (1300 to 1400 BCE), an [[Olmec]] group arrived and had a significant influence on the Tlatilca domain. Later, the Tlatilca were also heavily influenced by the Teotihuacan civilization. Between 1000 and 1200 CE, the Chichimeca conquered the Tlatilca and deposed their monarchy. The pyramid of El Conde was built during this time, located in what is now the El Conde neighborhood.&lt;ref name= "Enciclopedia" &gt;{{cite web |first=|last=|title=  Denominación Toponimia Naucalpan de Juárez |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_mexico |publisher=e-local gob.mx |location= |language= Spanish|trans-title=Toponymy Denomination Naucalpan de Juárez|date= |accessdate=Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "historiagob"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historia|url=http://www.naucalpan.gob.mx/historia |publisher= Municipio de Naucalpan |language= Spanish |trans-title=Naucalpan History|date= |accessdate= Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the area was ruled by [[Tlacopan]] &lt;ref&gt;Tlacopan or Tacuba, means "Plant ornament on flat land" in Nahuatl.&lt;/ref&gt; and ethnically came to be dominated by the [[Otomi people|Otomies]].&lt;ref&gt;Ethnic groups related to the Mazahua, Matlatzinca, Pame, Jonaz. The Otomi are an indigenous people of central Mexico. Linguistically related to the [[Otomi language]], an Otopamean language family, their ancestors settled the Mexican plateau several millennia before the Christian era&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1428 CE, the area was under [[Tepanec]] from [[Azcapotzalco]] domain, which was later conquered by the Triple Alliance, who named them Naucalpan.&lt;ref name= Enciclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name= historiagob /&gt;

==Cultures influencing El Conde==
Naucalpan is a Nahuatl name; some authors interpret its meaning as "the place of the four quarters" or "in the four quarters", but according to the etymological roots means "in four houses". Phonetic components are: Nau, grammatical contraction of nahui, means "four"; "cal derived calli, which means "House" and not "quarter" and pan, it should be interpreted, in this case, as "on" or "place": "in four houses" or “place of four houses".&lt;ref name= Enciclopedia/&gt;

===Tlatilco Culture===
The Tlatilca civilization –as called by later Nahuatl speaking groups- was a high population center in the early Preclassical period. The Tlatilco population reached the lands of current Naucalpan between 1700 and 600 BCE. Around 1400 BCE, the área had a large influence and presence of [[Otomi people|Otomí]] groups, and was called Otocampulco (Place of the Otomi).

In Naucalpan, ancient “tlatilquenses” from the “Cerro Tepalcate” were attracted by the Teotihuacan development stream.&lt;ref name= Enciclopedia/&gt;

===Chichimec Culture===
It arrived at the place between 1000 and 1200 CE, and settled near where the Aztecs would later build (Postclassical) the structure known today as El Conde.

===Tepanec Culture===
In 1428 the territory was claimed by [[Azcapotzalco]] tepanecs, but after being defeated by the Triple Alliance (Mexico), the territory was ceded to the [[Tlacopan]] [[Altepetl]], who later called the place [[Tacuba (Mexico)|Tacuba]].&lt;ref name=Enciclopedia/&gt;

==The Site==
[[File:El Conde main structure.JPG|thumb|400px|El Conde - main structure]]
[[File:El Conde perimeter wall 2.JPG|thumb|350px|El Conde – external foundations]]
The original name is unknown, El Conde retains this name since the 19th century, when a person by the name Manuel Conde lived atop the hill, so the place is known since as " Cerrito El Conde".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The site was discovered in 1907 by archaeologist [[Manuel Gamio]], and established that the site was constructed during the Postclassical Period.

The El Conde pyramid, is an over 2,00m sq.mt., structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=  Silvia |last=  Chávez Gonzalez |title=  Declara el INAH la pirámide El Conde área arqueológica |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/05/21/10an2cul.html |publisher= La Jornada UNAM |location=  |language= Spanish |trans-title=INAH Declares El Conde pyramid as an archaeological area |date= |accessdate= Sep 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological site comprises a rectangular platform, during  prehispanic times a tecpan or nobility Palace was built. Apparently, the structure corresponds to Aztec phase III.

The structure is one of the last examples of civil architecture from the late Postclassical. The front is a stairway and some embedded rooms that apparently at that time were very common for this type of buildings. Its layout is similar to those drawn in codices as the Quinantzin map, showing the Netzahualcoyotl Palace.

The tecpan was one of the most important buildings on mesoamerican communities, because they served as government seats, where administrative activities and meetings of local councils took place, where political decisions were taken.

In [[Customary international law|customary]] [[international law]], an '''enemy [[alien (law)|alien]]''' is any native, citizen, denizen or subject of any foreign nation or government with which a domestic nation or government is in conflict and who are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured and removed.   Usually, but not always, the countries are in a state of declared war.

==United Kingdom==
At the outbreak of World War II, in 1939, the United Kingdom had become a place of refuge for people who had fled Nazi persecution, including Jews and political refugees. At first, the authorities [[Defence Regulation 18B|interned]] these refugees with other enemy residents, without distinction. Later on, when Italy also declared war, significant numbers of Italian residents were also interned.

The [[Isle of Man]], relatively isolated from the British mainland and with a useful amount of holiday accommodation, was used to provide housing for the "Alien Civilians" (as it had in World War I). There were also efforts to move internees from Britain. In July, 1940, the ''[[Arandora Star]]'' was torpedoed and sunk while transporting Italian and German aliens to North America; 743 died, including prisoners, crew and guards. The 813 surviving prisoners were subsequently included in the 2,500 men transported by [[HMT Dunera|HMT ''Dunera'']] for internment in [[Hay, New South Wales]].

The [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Pioneer Corps]] was apparently the only British unit that enemy aliens could serve in early in the war. Many thousands of Germans and Austrians joined the Pioneer Corps to assist the Allied war efforts and liberation of their home countries. These were mainly Jews and political opponents of the Nazi Regime who had fled to Britain while it was still possible, and included the cinematographer [[Ken Adam]], writer [[George Clare (writer)|George Clare]] and publisher [[Robert Maxwell]]. These men - often dubbed "The King's Most Loyal Enemy Aliens" - later moved on to serve in fighting units. Some were recruited by [[Special Operations Executive]] (S.O.E.) as secret agents. They were instructed to choose an "English" name using their old initials.&lt;ref&gt;Interview by Colin MacGregor Stevens with Major George Bryant (aka George Breuer)&lt;/ref&gt;

Serving as German nationals in the British forces was particularly dangerous, since, in case of taken captive, with a high probability they would have been executed as traitors by the Germans. Also, the number of German-born Jews joining the British forces was exceptionally high; by the end of the war, one in seven Jewish refugees from Germany had joined the British forces. Their profound knowledge of the German language and customs proved useful. Many of them served in the administration of the British occupation army in Germany and Austria after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natgeochannel.co.uk/programmes/churchills-german-army National Geographic documentary ''Churchill's German Army'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{See also|Japanese-American internment|German-American internment|Italian-American internment}}
A well-known example of enemy aliens were the Japanese citizens residing in the United States during [[World War II]]. Many of these Japanese and Japanese Americans were imprisoned in [[Internment|internment camps]] by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] during wartime, alongside many German- and Italian-Americans. However, many [[Nisei#American Nisei|Japanese Americans]] and Italian-Americans were not actually "aliens", as they held American citizenship. The term "enemy alien" referred only to non-American citizens who were nationals of [[Axis powers|Axis]] countries. Included in this number were thousands of resident aliens who were prohibited from applying for citizenship by [[Naturalization Act of 1870|race-based naturalization laws]]; when war was declared against their native countries, their status changed from "resident" to "enemy" alien.  Therefore, German American, Italian American and Japanese American permanent residents were classified as enemy aliens and interned as such. In total 10,905 Italian Americans and approximately 110,000 Japanese Americans were interned in many different camps and sites across the country.  German Americans were held in more than 50 different locations.

Citizens of an enemy country who lived in the USA during World War II were required to have an "Enemy Alien" card and register monthly with the authorities.

'''Folklore in Hawaii''' in modern times is a mixture of various aspects of [[Hawaiian mythology]] and various [[urban legend]]s that have been passed on regarding various places in the Hawaiian islands.  The following is a partial list of some of these legends.

==Ancient Hawaiian folklore==
===Night marchers===
According to Hawaiian legend, '''[[Nightmarchers|night marchers]]''' (''huaka‘i po'' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]) are ghosts of ancient warriors.  They supposedly roam large sections of the island chain, and can be seen by groups of torches.  They can usually be found in areas that were once large battlefields (the [[Nuuanu Pali]] on the island of [[Oahu]] is a good example.)  Legend has it that if you look a night marcher straight in the eye, you will be forced to walk among them for eternity, but if you have a relative taken by them, you will be spared.  Hawaiians say that in the presence of night marchers, one should lie down on their stomach, face down to avoid eye contact, stay quiet, breathe shallowly, and don’t move. Some say that they may nudge you to provoke a reaction so they can take you. Moanalua Gardens is one of the many places the Night Marchers are said to roam.

===Carrying pork over the Nuuanu Pali===
Local folklore on the island of [[Oahu]] says that one should never carry pork over the [[Pali Highway]] connecting Honolulu and Windward Oahu.  The stories vary, but the classic legend is that if one carries pork of any kind over the old Pali road (not the modern pali highway) by automobile, the automobile would stop at a certain point on the way and not restart until the pork is removed from the vehicle.  
* Some versions of the story require the pork to be raw; other versions say that this happens after dark.
* In some versions, a white dog or an old woman in a holuku will appear at the time the automobile stalls, and you must feed the pork to the dog to proceed.

This legend has its roots in ancient Hawaiian mythology.  According to legend, the Hawaiian volcano goddess [[Pele (mythology)|Pele]] and the demigod Kamapua‘a (a half-man-half-pig) had a turbulent relationship, and the two agreed not to visit each other. If one takes pork over the Pali, the legend goes, one is symbolically taking a piece of Kamapua‘a from one side to the other, and it is said that Pele would stop that from happening.

Alternately, the legend is attributed to a magic dog, which was killed and cooked and put in an 'umeke to be carried over the pali and given as a gift to the mother/wife of the perpetrator. Women did not eat pork in ancient Hawaii, but were allowed to eat dog. The dog's owner followed and called to the dog, which came alive, answered from within the 'umeke, causing the carrier to drop his pole and flee. The dog then returns to its master. A dog as food was offensive to the American missionaries, and under their influence, the dog meat in the story became pork. The Pele/Kamapua'a stories were adapted to make the story fit, the old lady in the white holoku is also Pele, but that too was corrupted from other tales.

==Modern urban legends==
===Paradise Park/Manoa Falls Hiking Trail===
You can apparently hear a [[Ghost#Terminology|spectre]]/[[banshee]] screaming while walking along the path.  Paradise Park is the never discarded name of the bird show/exhibit that was located there in the past.  It was abandoned for an unknown reason.  If one goes to the side of the parking lot you will see the overgrown ruins of a nursery.  Behind this is a covered walkway twisting its way through dilapitated cages and building, some still bearing signs telling what kind of bird was housed there.  On one side of these buildings is a small hut with a statuette of the Virgin Mary, and a Portuguese stone oven.  There is also a Japanese pagoda.  There are no records of cultural exhibits at Paradise Park, so the purpose of these buildings remains a mystery.

===Events in Waialae and Kahala===
At one time, the land that is now subdivisions in [[Waialae, Hawaii|Waialae]] and [[Kahala Mall]] in eastern [[Honolulu]] were once the site of a graveyard.  Since that time, two known events have occurred there.

====The Mujina====
{{Main|Mujina}}

====The Green Lady====
The story of the green lady is that of a woman who would visit the gulch of [[Wahiawa, Hawaii|Wahiawa]], which also contains the [[Wahiawa Botanical Garden]], with her children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unsolvedmysteries.com/usm390878.html Most Haunted Town/City in Hawaii: Honolulu]&lt;/ref&gt;  One day while visiting one of her children became lost and was never found. The story goes that she still wanders the gulch looking for her child, or children, and will take any child that she comes across in the gulch.  There have been several reports of seeing a green woman covered in moss or mold wandering the gulch. Others say that the green woman closely resembles that of a Japanese mythological creature called the kappa. This creature is said to resemble a turtle-like humanoid that steals children to feast upon. The last known sighting was said to have happened in the mid to late 1980s.  In modern times, children and teenagers dare each other to run across the bridge that runs over the gulch at night. Most speculators say that this story was made up to keep children from wandering into the gulch by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.midweek.com/content/zones/central_news_article/green_lady_lurking_in_spooky_wahiawa_park/ Green Lady Lurking In Spooky Wahiawa Park]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2995">The '''foreign state of chargeability''' is a [[United States]] [[immigration]] concept – it is the country determined to be the applicant's origin. In general, the applicant's country of birth will determine their country of chargeability. For certain applicants born in oversubscribed countries such as India and China, approval to be chargeable to another country can significantly reduce the waiting time for their [[adjustment of status]] or [[consular processing]] of their [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] application. This process is also known as "alternate chargeability".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/AFM/HTML/AFM/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-2872/0-0-0-2888.html USCIS Field Manual], USCIS, section D.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules, codified in section 202(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-992.html Section 202(b)I of the INA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727045150/http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-992.html |date=2013-07-27 }}, Immigration and Nationality Act, section 202(b)I.&lt;/ref&gt; allow USCIS to determine the country of chargeability according to the following rules:

* When an applicant is a child, accompanied by or joining a parent, the child may be charged to the foreign state of either parent.
* When an applicant is born in a country where neither of the parents was born in or a subject of, may be charged to the country of either parent. For example, if child A is born during a family vacation in Mexico, but both parents are from Germany, the applicant may be charged to Germany.
* When an applicant is chargeable to a different country than his or her spouse, the applicant may be charged to the country of his or her spouse.
* When an applicant is born in the United States, he or she shall be considered to be born in the country of citizenship. This may be the case for children of diplomats who do not automatically derive citizenship by birth in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=5c1d3a4107083210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=5c1d3a4107083210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD Green Card for a Person Born in the United States to a Foreign Diplomat], USCIS Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Heptaméron''''' is a collection of 72 [[short stories]] written in French by [[Marguerite de Navarre|Marguerite]] of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] (1492–1549), published posthumously in 1558. It has the form of a [[frame narrative]] and was inspired by ''[[The Decameron]]'' of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]. It was originally intended to contain one hundred stories covering ten days just as ''The Decameron'' does, but at Marguerite’s death it was only completed as far as the second story of the eighth day. Many of the stories deal with love, lust, infidelity, and other romantic and sexual matters.  One was based on the life of [[Marguerite de La Rocque]], a French noblewoman who was punished by being abandoned with her lover on an island off [[Quebec]].

The collection first appeared in print in 1558 under the title ''Histoires des amans fortunez'' edited by [[Pierre Boaistuau]], who took considerable liberties with the original version, using only 67 of the stories, many in abbreviated form, and omitting much of the significant material between the stories. He also transposed stories and ignored their grouping into days as envisaged by the author. A second edition by [[Claude Gruget]] appeared only a year later in which the editor claimed to have "restored the order previously confused in the first impression". Also the prologues and epilogues to each short story left out by Boaistuau were put back and the work was given, for the first time, the title ''Heptaméron'' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἑπτά – "seven" and ἡμέρα – "day") due to the seven-day time frame into which the first 70 short stories are grouped.

==Summary of the "Prologue"==

In the "Prologue" to ''The Heptameron'', Parlamente, having obtained her husband Hircan's permission to do so, makes bold to ask Lady Oisille to devise an appropriate means by which the company of stranded guests, who are waiting for the building of a [[bridge]] to be completed and who are beset by a series of natural calamities and criminal actions that keeps them virtual prisoners in an [[abbey]], may amuse themselves. A devout [[Christian]], the lady suggests that they read the [[Bible]]. However, Hircan says that they are young enough to need other diversions as well. Parlamente suggests that those who want to write stories after the manner of [[Boccaccio]], do so, sharing them with the others in the afternoon, after [[Scriptures]] are read in the morning. (Marguerite herself was a protector of [[François Rabelais]], who dedicated the third volume of his book, ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'', to her.) It will take 10 days to complete the bridge, and, each day, in a shady grove in a meadow, the writers will share 10 tales, telling a total of 100 stories. The stories will be published, if the audience likes them, and be presented to the listeners as presents.

Lady Oisille agrees to Parlamente's recommendation, provided that the stories are true.

==Sample story summarized==

Saffrendent tells the third story, which is set in [[Naples]], [[Italy]], during the reign of King Alfonso.

During a carnival, the king visits his subjects’ homes as they vie to provide him the best hospitality. As he visits a happily married young couple, he is smitten by the wife’s beauty, and he sends her husband to Rome for a couple weeks on trumped-up business. While the husband is away, the king succeeds in seducing the wife. After a while, the husband becomes suspicious of his wife’s fidelity. He bides his time in silence, hoping for the opportunity to avenge himself.

He convinces the queen that he loves her and that she deserves to be treated better by her husband, who dishonors her in cuckolding him. They agree to an adulterous affair between themselves, so that the nobleman cuckolds the king who has cuckolded him. Whenever the nobleman visits his country estates, the king visits his wife, but secretly lusts after men. Instead of going to his estates, the nobleman now goes to the castle to dally with the queen, while the king commits adultery with his wife. The affairs continue for years, well into the couples’ old age.

Like many stories of this sort, Saffredent’s tale deals with the theme of [[cuckold]]ry and depends on both [[Irony#Dramatic irony|dramatic]] and [[Irony#Situational irony|situational irony]] for its plot and effects.

'''Hire Benakal''' (or '''Hirebenakal''') is a [[megalithic]] site in the state of [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. It is among a few Indian megalithic sites dated 800 BCE to 200 BCE which are located {{Convert|10|km}} west of [[Gangavati]] town in [[Koppal district]] and {{Convert|35|km}} from [[Hospet]] city. It contains roughly 400 megalithic funerary monuments, dated to the transition period between [[Neolithic]] and the [[Iron Age]] periods. Known locally in the [[Kannada language]] as ''elu guddagalu,'' their specific name is ''Moryar Gudda'' (''gudda'', meaning "hill"). Hire Benakal is reported to be the largest [[necropolis]] among the 2000 odd megalithic sites found in South India, mostly in Karnataka.&lt;ref name=megalithic/&gt; Since 1955, it has been under the management of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) within the [[Dharwad]] circle.&lt;ref name=Sivanandan2011&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/01/25/stories/2011012561850500.htm|title=This megalithic settlement near Hire Benakal in Koppal district remains hidden away|date=25 January 2011|accessdate=5 February 2013|publisher=''The Hindu''|first=T.V. |last=Sivanandan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Deccan&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/98072/portals-ancient-way-life.html|title=Portals to an ancient way of life| date=20 September 2012| publisher=Deccan Herald|accessdate=5 February 2013|first=Meera |last=Iyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hire Benakal has been proposed for recognition as an [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name=megalithic&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guidaindia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2637&amp;Itemid=61|title=The megalithic tombs of Hirebenakal: The Art, History and Culture - Art and Architecture|language=Italian|accessdate=6 February 2013|publisher= Guida India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Pre-historic tombs.JPG|left|thumb|Prehistoric site]]
The funerary monuments are located on a rocky range of seven hillocks. The site is on the left bank of the [[Tungabhadra River]]. It is covered with thorny bushes and slippery scattered boulders. The climb to reach the site is difficult as there are no regular paths or roads, except for a goat track. In addition, a [[rivulet]] has to be crossed.&lt;ref name="Sivanandan2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Deccan/&gt; A perennial source of water has been found in the form of a lake and an old [[quarry]] site discovered nearby was probably the source for building materials of the type found in Hire Benakal monuments.&lt;ref name=Deccan/&gt; Hire Benakal village is approachable from the towns of [[Gangavathi]], [[Hospet]] and [[Koppal]] by the state highway. The nearest railway station to the site is Hospet.&lt;ref name="Sivanandan2011" /&gt;

==History==
This site was built more than 2000 years ago; many of the megalithic structures are dated to between 800 BCE and 200 BCE.&lt;ref name="Sivanandan2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Deccan/&gt; The Iron Age period spanned more than 1000 years from 1200 BCE to 200 CE in this part of India.&lt;ref name=Deccan/&gt; The port-holed chamber in the western group of the Hire Benakal area has been compared to similar finds at [[Rajankolur]].&lt;ref name="The Karnatak Historical Review"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Karnatak Historical Review|volume=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TT1uAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=3 January 2013|year=1987|author=Karnatak Historical Research Society|publisher=Dharwad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published reports on Hire Benakal were those in the ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'' in 1835, by [[Philip Meadows Taylor]], who was under the service of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]].&lt;ref name="megalithic" /&gt; For over a century thereafter, no further systematic study of the site was conducted. Between 1944-48, Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]] undertook archaeological excavations; these were supplemented by Adiga Sundara and were published in 1975.&lt;ref name=megalithic/&gt; In his publication, "The Early Chamber Tombs of South India: A Study of the Iron Age Megalithic Monuments of North Karnataka", Sundara's cataloging describes details of 300 megalithic burial chambers at a site which was surrounded in thick forest.&lt;ref name=megalithic/&gt; [[Andrew Bauer]] of the Department of Anthropology at the [[University of Illinois]] has carried out investigations in recent years and has identified about 1000 different types of antiquaries from an area of about {{Convert|20|ha}}. His finds describe anthropomorphic funerary structures,  [[menhirs]], and stone fences in circular shapes. Bauer has further stated that the [[dolmen]]s supported by stone slabs have been erected perfectly without any joining mortar.&lt;ref name=megalithic/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Pre-historic tombs-2.JPG|right|thumb|Boulder supported dolmen chambers]]
The setting for the approximately 400 megalithic monuments convey the feeling of a ghost town.&lt;ref name=Deccan/&gt; Their structures are varied in shape and size. There are clusters of [[dolmens]], three sided chambers with capstones forming the roof.&lt;ref name=Deccan/&gt; The small dolmens are {{Convert|50|-|100|cm}}, while the larger ones measure up to {{Convert|3|m}} height. The buried and semi-buried dolmens are categorized as [[cists]] and dolmenoid cists, and are arranged in circular layouts.  Most of them have collapsed.&lt;ref name="Sivanandan2011" /&gt; The dolmens with round [[porthole]]s give the appearance of dwellings with windows but they are funerary structures. These dolmens flank both sides of the main street. Pit circles and oblong chambers covered with gable stone roofs have also been found. The dolmenoid cists are in several shapes and sizes. Those in an oblong shape are discerned to have been built with packing of rubble stones at the ground level. A circular enclosure is noted. Around these structures there is a pit filled with layers of earth.&lt;ref name=Deccan/&gt;&lt;ref name="Studies1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Indian Society for Prehistoric and Quaternary Studies|title=Essays in Indian protohistory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwJuAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=3 January 2013|year=1979|publisher=Published on behalf of the Indian Society for Prehistoric and Quaternary Studies [by] B.R. Pub. Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rock shelters, there are paintings of people dancing, hunting, and holding weapons. There are also geometric and mystic designs of deer, peacocks, antelopes, humped bulls, horses and cows. An unusual find is a stone kettledrum on a {{Convert|10|m}} high boulder. The boulder is hemispherical in shape with a diameter of {{Convert|2|m}} and standing {{Convert|1.5|m}} in height. The boulder, when struck with a wooden hammer, produces sounds which are heard up to {{Convert|1|km}} away.&lt;ref name="Sivanandan2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Deccan/&gt; In this area, the caves were either residences or places of worship; they contained cave paintings in [[red ocher]] colour which corroborates the existences of the funerary structures nearby.&lt;ref name=megalithic/&gt; 
[[File:Cave painting at hirebenakal.JPG|right|thumb|Cave painting]]

==Artifacts==
Pottery from the neolithic have been found. Pre-megalithic implements, iron slag, pottery of Neolithic, megalithic and early historic period have been identified. Iron implements, a common megalithic period find in South India, is also found at Hire Benakal site. These cultural finds are both neolithic and megalithic period implements. Along with megalithic period pottery, iron slag was also part of the finds.&lt;ref name=Deccan/&gt;

==Preservation==
Although the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) is entrusted with renovation and maintenance of this site, hardly any activity is evident. It is not a well known site among the people of India and only a few dozen foreign tourists visit the site annually.&lt;ref name=Deccan/&gt; Improving signage is essential at the base of the hill and near the Raichur-Koppal State Highway.&lt;ref name=megalithic/&gt; The dolmens have been subject to looting over the centuries by robbers in search of treasures. Shepherds continue to graze their livestock at the site, resulting in frequent collapse of the dolmens.&lt;ref name=megalithic/&gt;

==Culture==
During an annual festival, local people do not venture to this area for cattle grazing as they believe that on the festival day, God walks through the seven hills of Hire Benakal.&lt;ref name=Deccan/&gt;

'''''Hollywood's Comedy Nights''''' is an English-language [[stand-up comedy]] show in [[Cologne]], Germany.&lt;ref name="Lifestyle Magazine 2004, P. 5-9"&gt;Lifestyle Magazine, Sixth Sense British Forces Newspaper, April 2004, P. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollywoods Comedy Nights"&gt;[http://www.hollywoodscomedynights.de/ Hollywoods Comedy Nights&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928073258/http://www.hollywoodscomedynights.de/ |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show was started by stand-up comedian, actor and MC [[Johnny "Hollywood" Rotnem]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnnyhollywood.de/ Neue Seite 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930005251/http://www.johnnyhollywood.de/ |date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has played in numerous venues since 2000. It has also been a part of the [[Cologne Comedy Festival]] since 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Cologne Comedy Festival Programme, 2003: P.38, 2004: P.43, 2005: P.48, 2006: P.52, 2007: p.63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Express, 28 September 2004, P.23 "Hier lachen Sie richtig" para.4 "Internationale Gäste". Pub: Kölnischen Zeitung GmbH,&lt;/ref&gt; and claims to have been the first English-language stand-up comedy show in Germany.

==History==
''Hollywoods Comedy Nights'' was founded by John "Hollywood" Rotnem to give himself and other comedians regular stage-time in which to practice and improve their act.  Initially, just one German-language show was performed, monthly, at the Melody Club.  On moving to Flanagan's in the Altstadt in 2004, the show became two separate monthly shows, one featuring German-language performers, the other featuring comedy in English, due to demand from the large British/American Forces and English-speaking expatriate community in the North Rhine Westphalen area.  The show began featuring both local native-English-speaking comedians, German who wished to try their hand at English language comedy, and imported native-English comedians from the UK, US and Canada.

With the move to the Cologne Hard Rock Cafe, the show concentrated solely on English-language stand-up comedy, as the audience for the  German-language show had dropped off, and because many people confused the English and German shows.  A sister show, at Fiddlers Pub in Bonn-Endenich, started in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"Have you heard the one about....?" Rhine Magazine, March/April 2007,P.30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-network.de/Whats_on_in_Bonn/Live_Entertainment/Comedy_Nights/ English-Network - Comedy Nights&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  By mid-2007, a change of ownership and new limitations on live shows at the Hard Rock Cafe forced a change of venue, to the Alter Wartesaal at Cologne Hauptbahnhof.  The large size of the Alter Wartesaal and the positioning of the show in the week (Mondays) made it extremely difficult to fill, and so only three shows took place there.  The show then moved back to Flanagan's Irish Pub in the Altermarkt, not far from the Alter Wartesaal.

Many comedians have performed in the shows, such as [[Heinz Gröning]](better known to German audiences as ''der Unglaubliche Heinz'', moderator of "Um Antwort wird Gebieten"(Comedy Central) and "FunkHaus" (WDR)),&lt;ref&gt;Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger, No.236 Sat/Sun 11/12 Oct 2003 P.33 "Hollywoods komische Nacht"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris McCausland]],&lt;ref&gt;Rhine Magazine, issue 5, Sept/Oct 2004,P.65&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Day]] and [[Pommy Johnson]].  The show features established English-speaking comedians, as well as giving German performers the chance to try their hand at performing in English.

==Importance==
The show is one of a growing number of venues in Germany that feature English-language performers, other notable venues being [[The English Comedy Club]] in Munich and [[The Kookaburra Comedy Club]] in Berlin.  As well as featuring native-speaking English comedians, the show gives German comedians the chance to try their hand at comedy in the English language.

==Offshoots==
In an attempt to produce more local English-language comedians, Johnny Hollywood founded [[Comedians Anonymous]], a comedy collective which aims to help fledgling comedians take their first steps as performers.  Some members of the collective are occasionally featured in the ''Comedy Nights'' show.  The most frequently-performing members of the collective (so far) are James Allan(UK),&lt;ref name="Cologne Comedy Festival Programme p.63"&gt;2007 Cologne Comedy Festival Programme, p.63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cologne Comedy Festival Programme p.39"&gt;2008 Cologne Comedy Festival Programme, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Casey James(USA),&lt;ref name="Cologne Comedy Festival Programme p.63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cologne Comedy Festival Programme p.39"/&gt; Cat LaRouge(Norway)&lt;ref name="Cologne Comedy Festival Programme p.39"/&gt; and Steve Dix(UK).&lt;ref name="Cologne Comedy Festival Programme p.63"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cologne Comedy Festival Programme p.39"/&gt;

An [[Open mike|Open Mike Night]] is occasionally staged, as another way of finding new talent.

==Performers==
The following is a list of some of the comedians who have performed at the show, and the dates they performed. Dates before 2007 are difficult to ascertain due to lack of 3rd party details.  To add to the confusion, some performers have only performed in the German shows, some in both, and some in the English shows.  the list is by no means exhaustive, and only includes notable comedians and doesn't include show presenters.

The '''Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute (HATII)''' was a research and teaching institute at the [[University of Glasgow]] in [[Scotland]]. It was established in 1997 to enhance Glasgow’s reputation as a centre of excellence in [[Digital humanities|Humanities Computing]] and [[Information science|Information Studies]] with Professor [[Seamus Ross]] as its Founding Director (until 2009). HATII led innovative research in archival and library science and in information/knowledge management with emphasis on their impact on the growth of the creative industries. Recognised and pioneering research strengths were in the areas of humanities computing, digitisation, digital curation and preservation, and archives and records management. Members of HATII, most of whom had day-to-day experience mediating information in a variety of formats, led research under the broad headings of access and re-usability, content analysis and appraisal, evaluation and impact technologies, and preservation/curation.

HATII was home to or partner in range of national and international research initiatives, including [[AHDS Performing Arts]], 3D-COFORM (Tools and Expertise for 3D Collection Formation),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C3D-COFORM (Tools and Expertise for 3D Collection Formation)|url=http://www.3d-coform.eu/|work=website|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C3D-COFORM (Tools and Expertise for 3D Collection Formation)|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/89256_en.html|work=CORDIS Website|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; SHAMAN (Sustaining Heritage Access through Multivalent ArchiviNg),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHAMAN - Sustaining Heritage Access through Multivalent ArchiviNg|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/85468_en.html|work=CORDIS Website|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DigiCULT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DigiCULT Project|url=http://www.digicult.info/pages/info.php|work=website|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CASPAR (Cultural, Artistic and Scientific knowledge Preservation,for Access and Retrieval),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CASPAR Digital Preservation Project|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/92920_en.html|work=CORDIS Website|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DELOS Digital Library Network of Excellence Preservation Cluster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DELOS (Digital Library Network of Excellence)|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/71130_en.html|work=CORDIS Website|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planets (Preservation and Long-term Access to our Cultural and Scientific Heritage),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planets (Preservation and Long-term Access to our Cultural and Scientific Heritage)|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/99184_en.html|work=CORDIS Website|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily History, [[Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951]] and TheGlasgowStory. In addition to its contributions to these research projects, its groundbreaking initiative Electronic Research Preservation and Access NETwork (ERPANET) had a broad impact on developing the preservation research community ethos in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ERPANET|url=http://www.erpanet.org/about.php|work=website|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ERPANET|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/61043_en.html|work=CORDIS website|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by Digital Preservation Europe|DigitalPreservationEurope (DPE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Preservation Europe|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/101694_en.html|work=CORDIS website|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produced such research outputs as [[DRAMBORA]] and PLATTER, experimented with animation as a mechanism for dissemination of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digiman Animations on Digital Preservation|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/wepreserve|work=animations|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; HATII was a founding partner of the UK's [[Digital Curation Centre]] (DCC)in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Digital Curation Centre|url=http://www.dcc.ac.uk/|work=website|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about scholarship conducted at HATII is available in [[Research Assessment Exercise]] submissions for RAE2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HATII 2001 RAE Submission|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/2001/submissions/Form.asp?Route=2&amp;HESAInst=H-0168&amp;UoA=61&amp;MSub=Z|work=RAE|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and RAE2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HATII 2008 RAE Submission|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/submissions/submission.aspx?id=177&amp;type=hei&amp;subid=2306|work=RAE|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crucial in its development was its transition from an early research emphasis on tools and services as seen in its 2001 RAE submission to a focus on fundamental research and theory (evident in its RAE2008 submission) in such areas as investigations of the cultural production and the creation and communication of knowledge in the arts, humanities and cultural heritage, materiality of the digital, knowledge representation and dissemination, records and recordkeeping practices, data and digital curation, genre studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KRYS Corpus|url=http://www.krys-corpus.eu/index.html|work=website|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; digitiality in museums, and more recently games studies.

Between 1997 and when it launched its first degree programs in the early 2000s HATII pioneered teaching in such domains as Multimedia (from 1997), Digitisation (from 1998), and Cyberspace Studies (from 2000). HATII founded the UK's first postgraduate program in digital preservation/curation as an MSc Information Management and Preservation in 2001. In 2003 building on its record of undergraduate teaching it launched a joint honours MA in Arts and Media Informatics which eventually became a single honours MA in Digital Media and Information Studies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}  Both the undergraduate MA and the MSc are accredited [[CILIP]] (Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals)  and the MSc is also accredited by the UK [[Archives and Records Association]]. In 2010 HATII established an MSc program in Museum Studies.

After twenty years HATII became, in September 2017, Information Studies.

'''''I Am a Pole (And So Can You!)''''' is a 2012 spoof of inspirational children's books. It was written by [[Stephen Colbert]] and illustrated by Paul Hildebrand. The book tells the story of a fictional pole finding his purpose in life. The title is a play on Colbert's first book, ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]''. All proceeds from the audiobook go to the United States Veterans Initiative, a non-profit dedicated to returning troops.

The book is notable for a [[blurb]] of endorsement on the cover attributed to children's writer [[Maurice Sendak]]. During a January 2012 interview of Sendak by Colbert, Colbert shared a draft of the book with Sendak, to which Sendak stated "The sad thing is, I like it!"; the statement was used as the blurb for the cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.colbertnation.com/articles/i-am-a-pole|title = I Am A Pole (And So Can You!)|date = May 8, 2012|publisher = Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, Colbert reportedly secured a publishing deal for the book. Sendak coincidentally died the morning of the book's release, and, in tribute, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' aired uncensored previously unreleased clips of the interview, with Colbert encouraging those unfamiliar with Sendak's work to "read his books. And for those who don't read, they've got lots of pictures."

Reviewers of the book noted that this book, while seemingly targeted to children, contains imagery which may be considered adult in nature, such as a scene of a [[stripper]] performing [[striptease]] [[Pole dance|on the eponymous pole]]. Colbert, parodying the marketing of inspirational books, mentioned on his show that the book is "the perfect gift to give a child, or grandchild, for their high school or college graduation. Also, Father's Day. Also, other times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/338535/20120508/stephen-colbert-book-pole-maurice-sendak.htm|title = Stephen Colbert Book ‘I Am A Pole (And So Can You!)’ Is NOT For Children|author=Cristina Miller|work= International Business Times|date = May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, 2012, the [[Rosenbach Museum]] added the book to its collections, and displayed its manuscript and several artifacts that Colbert claimed were on his desk when the book was written next to the manuscript of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', along with artifacts from the original interview.

'''Iximche''' ({{IPA|/iʃimˈtʃe/}}) (or '''Iximché''' using [[Spanish language|Spanish]] orthography) is a [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[archaeological site]] in the western highlands of [[Guatemala]]. Iximche was the capital of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Postclassic]] [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] kingdom from 1470 until its abandonment in 1524. The architecture of the site included a number of [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid-temples]], palaces and two [[Mesoamerican ballcourts]]. Excavators uncovered the poorly preserved remains of painted murals on some of the buildings and ample evidence of [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|human sacrifice]]. The ruins of Iximche were declared a Guatemalan National Monument in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Centro de Acción Legal - Ambiental y Social de Guatemala (CALAS).&lt;/ref&gt; The site has a small museum displaying a number of pieces found there, including sculptures and ceramics. It is open daily.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p197-198"/&gt;

For many years the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] served as loyal allies of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]].&lt;ref name="ScheleMathew99p295"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.295.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing power of the Kaqchikel within the alliance eventually caused such friction that the Kaqchikel were forced to flee the K'iche' capital and found the city of Iximche.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.296.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaqchikel established their new capital upon an easily defensible ridge almost surrounded by deep ravines.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p23"&gt;Guillemin 1967, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; Iximche developed quickly as a city and within 50 years of its foundation it had reached its maximum extent.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p24"&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of Iximche were four principal lords drawn from the four main clans of the Kaqchikel, although it was the lords of the Sotz'il and Xahil clans who held the real power.&lt;ref&gt;Polo Sifontes 1986, pp.39-40. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.300.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the initial establishment of Iximche, the K'iche' left the Kaqchikel in peace for a number of years.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt; The peace did not last and the Kaqchikel soundly defeated their former overlords around 1491.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.297.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by infighting among the Kaqchikel clans with the rebel clans finally being overcome in 1493.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; Wars against the K'iche' continued throughout the early 16th century.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; When the Spanish [[conquistador]]s arrived in Mexico, the [[Aztec]] emperor sent messengers to warn the Kaqchikel.&lt;ref&gt;Polo Sifontes 1986, p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; After the surrender of the Aztecs to [[Hernán Cortés]], Iximche sent its own messengers to offer a Kaqchikel alliance with the Spanish.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; [[Smallpox]] decimated the population of Iximche before the physical arrival of the Europeans.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; At the time of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Conquest]] Iximche was the second most important city in the [[Guatemalan Highlands]], after the K'iche' capital at [[Q'umarkaj]].&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p12"&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; Conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]] was initially well received in the city in 1524 and the Kaqchikel kings provided the Spanish with native allies to assist in the conquest of the other highland Maya kingdoms.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; Iximche was declared the first capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala in the same year.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; Due to excessive Spanish demands for tribute the Kaqchikel soon broke the alliance and deserted their capital, which was burned 2 years later by Spanish deserters.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp.298, 310, 386n19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Europeans founded a new town nearby but abandoned it in 1527 due to the continued hostility of the Kaqchikel,&lt;ref name="Schele 1999, pp.299"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp.299, 386n20.&lt;/ref&gt; who finally surrendered in 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp.298. Lutz 1997, pp.10, 258. Ortiz Flores 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruins of Iximche were first described by a Guatemalan historian in the late 17th century.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p14"&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; They were visited various times by scholars during the 19th century, who published plans and descriptions.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, pp.195-196"&gt;Kelly 1996, pp.195-196.&lt;/ref&gt; Serious investigations of the site started in the 1940s and continued sporadically until the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.196. Guillemín 1965, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, during the [[Guatemalan Civil War]], a meeting took place at the ruins between guerillas and Maya leaders that resulted in the guerillas stating that they would defend indigenous rights.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p45"&gt;Frühsorge 2007, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; A ritual was carried out at the site in 1989 in order to reestablish the ruins as a sacred place for Maya ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p48"&gt;Frühsorge 2007, p.48.&lt;/ref&gt; United States President [[George W. Bush]] visited the site in 2007,&lt;ref name="BBC News, 12 March 2007"&gt;BBC News, 12 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year Iximche was the venue for the III Continental Summit of Indigenous Peoples and Nationalities of Abya Yala.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Secretaría Cumbre Continental de Pueblos y Organizaciones Indígenas 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The site's name derives from the Mayan name of the [[Brosimum alicastrum|ramon]] tree (''Brosimum alicastrum''), from the words ''ixim'' and ''che'', meaning literally "[[maize]] tree".&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1998, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt; Iximche was called ''Guatemala'' by the Spanish, from the [[Nahuatl]] ''Quauhtemallan'' meaning "forested land".&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p292"&gt;Schelle &amp; Mathews 1999, p.292.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Spanish [[conquistador]]s founded their first capital at Iximche, they took the name of the city used by their Nahuatl-speaking Mexican allies and applied it to the new Spanish city and, by extension, to the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|kingdom]]. From this comes the modern name of the country.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p292"/&gt; The site has also been referred to as Patinamit by 19th century investigators, a [[Kaqchikel language|Kaqchikel]] word meaning "the city".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, pp.192, 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iximche is located {{convert|3|km|mi}} south of [[Tecpán Guatemala|Tecpán]],&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p9"&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{convert|90|km|mi}} west of [[Guatemala City]],&lt;ref&gt;Frühsorge 2007, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; in the northwest of the [[Departments of Guatemala|Guatemalan department]] of [[Chimaltenango Department|Chimaltenango]].&lt;ref name="Kelly96p192"&gt;Kelly 1996, p.192.&lt;/ref&gt; The city was built at an altitude of {{convert|2260|m|ft}}&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p9"/&gt; in an easily defensible position on a ridge surrounded by deep ravines, in order to defend the city from its hostile K'iche' and [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujil]] neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.192. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.299. Guillemin 1967, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; The ridge is called Ratzamut and is a promontory of Tecpán hill, a {{convert|3075|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} mountain to the northwest of the ruins, which sit at the southeastern end of this promontory.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p14"/&gt; The ridge is flanked by two rivers flowing in deep ravines, Río El Molino and Río Los Chocoyos, which both join to flow southwest into the [[Madre Vieja River]], which empties into the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p14"/&gt; Iximche is located among [[Central American pine-oak forests|pine forests]] common to highland Guatemala.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p23"/&gt;

==Political organisation==
The Kaqchikel kingdom itself was divided among four [[clan]]s that between them contained ten principal lineages or "big houses".&lt;ref name="PoloSifontes86p40"&gt;Polo Sifontes 1986, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; The clans themselves were the Xahil, who were the main branch of the Kaqchikel, the Sotz'il, the Tukuche and the [[Chajoma|Akajal]].&lt;ref name="PoloSifontes86p40"/&gt;

The rulers of Iximche were four principal lords with the titles of ''Ahpo Sotz'il'', ''Ahpo Xahil'', ''K'alel Achi'' and ''Ahuchan'', although in reality it was the first two of these that held the real power.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.300. Polo Sifontes 1986, p.39. ''Sotz'il'' also has the variant spellings of ''Zotzil'' and ''Tzotzil''. They should not be confused with the [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzil Maya]] of Chiapas, Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt; The two main clans of the Kaqchikel people each provided a leader, one was the ''Ahpo Sotz'il'' ("Lord of the Sotz'il") and the other was the ''Ahpo Xahil''.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p299-300"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp.299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; These royal titles were originally bestowed upon the leaders of the Xahil and Sotz'il clans by the K'iche' in gratitude for their military services to the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj]].&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p299-300"/&gt; Both leaders were supposed to be equal in rank but in practice the Sotz'il king was the senior (or ''nab'ey al'', "firstborn child") while the king of the Xahil was subordinate (the ''chipil al'', "lastborn child").&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p300"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.300.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''K'alel Achi'' and the ''Ahuchan'' were the other two lords, which translate from Kaqchikel as the "principal person" and the "speaker".&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p300"/&gt; The Kaqchikel document ''Testamento de los Xpantzay'' gives alternate titles for two of the four lords. This document lists the ''Ahpo Sotz'il'' and the ''Ahpo Xahil'' as the two most important, the other two lords were drawn from two additional clans and were the ''Ahpo Tukuche'' ("Lord of the Tukuche") and the ''Ahpo Raxonihay'' ("Lord of the Raxonihay").&lt;ref&gt;Polo Sifontes 1986, pp.39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The titles of ''Ahpo Sotz'il'' and ''Ahpo Xahil'' were passed from father to son.&lt;ref name="PoloSifontes86p40"/&gt; The Xahil heir bore the title ''Ahpop Achi Ygich'', and the Sotz'il heir bore the title ''Ahpop Achi Balam''.&lt;ref name="PoloSifontes86p40"/&gt; They were important positions in their own right and the heirs were military leaders who commanded on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Polo Sifontes 1986, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Iximche was founded in the late 15th century AD Wuqu-Batz' was ''Ahpo Sotz'il'', Hun-Toh was ''Ahpo Xahil'', Chuluk was ''K'alel Achi'' and Xitamel-Keh was ''Ahuchan''.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p300"/&gt; According to the early Colonial Kaqchikel document ''Memorial de Sololá'', the last two of these were not very important.&lt;ref&gt;Polo Sifontes 1986, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the four lords had his own section in the new city that included his palace, royal court and temples.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p300"/&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
Archaeologists only found traces of one pre-Kaqchikel occupational phase and this was an ancient level dating to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]].&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasional Early and Late Classic remains have been found but they are incidental and do not represent a Classic Period occupation of the site.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"/&gt;

===Late Postclassic history===
{{Maya civilization}}
The Kaqchikel people were closely related to the K'iche', their former allies.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp.293-294.&lt;/ref&gt; The K'iche'an peoples (including the Kaqchikel, the K'iche' and others) had received strong influences from central Mexico since the time of the great Early Classic metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.294-295.&lt;/ref&gt; The history of Iximche is largely drawn from the ''[[Annals of the Cakchiquels|Annals of the Kaqchikels]]'', a document written in the Kaqchikel language but using [[Latin alphabet|Latin characters]] soon after the Spanish Conquest.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p292"/&gt; This document details the origins, history and conquest of the Kaqchikels.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p292"/&gt; The Kaqchikel served as close allies of the K'iche' for many years.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathew99p295"/&gt; The Kaqchikel rulers Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' served the great K'iche' king K'iq'ab with such loyalty that he rewarded them with the royal titles ''Ahpo Sotz'il'' and ''Ahpo Xahil'' and the power to rule.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt; The sons of K'iq'ab became jealous of the growing power of the Kaqchikel lords and led a revolt against their father that seriously damaged his authority.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt; This revolt had serious consequences for the K'iche' as their conquered domains seized the opportunity to break free from their subjugation.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt;

A minor incident in the K'iche' capital Q'umarkaj escalated to have important consequences.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt; A K'iche' soldier tried to seize bread from a Kaqchikel woman who was selling it in the market.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt; The woman refused the soldier and drove him off with a stick.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt; The Kaqchikel demanded the execution of the K'iche' soldier while the K'iche' nobility demanded the punishment of the Kaqchikel bread seller.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt; When the Kaqchikel lords refused to hand her over, the K'iche' lords sentenced Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' to death against the wishes of the K'iche' king K'iq'ab.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt; King K'iq'ab warned his Kaqchikel friends and advised them to flee Q'umarkaj.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt; On the day 13 Iq' of the Kaqchikel calendar the four lords of the Kaqchikel led their people out of the K'iche' capital to found their own capital at Iximche.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt; The exact year of this event is not known with certainty but is believed to have been between AD 1470 and 1485, with some scholars, such as Guillemín, preferring 1470.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.296. Guillemín 1965, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaqchikel abandoned their previous capital ''Chiavar'' (speculated to be modern [[Chichicastenango]]) because it was too close to [[Q'umarkaj]].&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p25"&gt;Guillemin 1967, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

K'iq'ab prevented his nobles from making war on the Kaqchikel for the remainder of his life, giving his former allies the time to establish their own kingdom and prepare its defences.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt; When Hun-Toh died he was succeeded by his son Lahuh-Ah.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt; Lahuh-Ah died in 1488 and was replaced by Kablahuh-Tihax.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p296"/&gt; Oxlahuh-Tz'i', the son of Wuqu-Batz', had a long and successful reign and lived through the reigns of two of his co-rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp.296-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kaqchikel kings Oxlahuh-Tz'i' and Kablahuh-Tihax gained a definitive victory over the K'iche' around 1491 when they captured the K'iche' kings Tepepul and Itzayul together with the idol of their most important deity [[Tohil]].&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.297. This event occurred on the day 10 Tz'i' of the Kaqchikel calendar.&lt;/ref&gt; The captured K'iche' kings were sacrificed together with a number of nobles and high-ranking soldiers, including the son and grandson of the king.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; After this defeat of the K'iche', two Kaqchikel clans rebelled, the Akahal and the Tukuche.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; The kings Oxlahuh-Tz'i' and Kablahuh-Tihax crushed the rebellion on 20 May 1493.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt;

Oxlahuh-Tz'i' died on 23 July 1508 and was succeeded by his son Hun-Iq'.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; Kablahuh-Tihax died on 4 February 1509 and was succeeded by his son Lahuh-Noh.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; The Kaqchikel continued their wars against the K'iche' kingdom over the following decade.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; The Aztec emperor [[Moctezuma II]] sent messengers to the Kaqchikel in 1510, warning of strangers in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="SM99p297PS86p70"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.297. Polo Sifontes 1986, p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1512 he sent another messenger (named as Witz'itz'il) warning of the arrival of the Spanish in [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] and [[Veracruz]].&lt;ref name="SM99p297PS86p70"/&gt;

In 1513 the Kaqchikel suffered from a plague of locusts.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; The following year, in 1514, Iximche was severely damaged by a fire.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; A plague, described as terrible in the Annals of the Kaqchikel, struck the city in 1519 and lasted two years, resulting in a large number of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1998, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt; This was likely to have been [[smallpox]] brought to the Americas with the Spanish.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; After the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]] fell to the Spanish onslaught in 1521, the Kaqchikel sent messengers to [[Hernán Cortés]] offering an alliance with the Spanish.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt;

On 11 August 1521, Belehe Qat and Cahi Imox were chosen as lords of the city after the deaths of Hun-Iq' and Lahuh-Noh, the previous kings.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemin 1967, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; Cahi Imox was the ''Ahpo Sotz'il'' and Belehe Qat was the ''Ahpo Xahil''.&lt;ref&gt;Polo Sifontes 1986, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the Spanish Conquest, the Kaqchikel kingdom based at Iximche was still expanding into areas formerly controlled by the K'iche' and it was rapidly becoming the most powerful new kingdom in the Guatemalan Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.626, 765.&lt;/ref&gt; It was second in importance only to the K'iche' capital at [[Q'umarkaj]].&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p12"/&gt;

===Spanish Conquest===
{{see also|Spanish conquest of Guatemala}}
[[File:Alvarado.jpeg|thumb|left|Conquistador Pedro de Alvarado was initially welcomed into Iximche with open arms.]]
When Spanish conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]] arrived in what is now Guatemala in 1524, 3 years after the conquest of the Aztecs, he found the highland Maya kingdoms weakened by twenty years of warfare and swept by the first European plagues.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; In the period of February to March 1524 he fought and completely defeated the K'iche', razed Q'umarkaj and executed the K'iche' kings.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; The Spanish were invited into Iximche on 14 April 1524 and were well received by the lords Belehe Qat and Cahi Imox.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.297. Guillemín 1965, p.9. Recinos places all these dates 2 days earlier (e.g. the Spanish arrival at Iximche on 12 April rather than 14 April) based on vague dating in Spanish primary records. Schele and Fahsen calculated all dates on the more securely dated Kaqchikel annals, where equivalent dates are often given in both the Kaqchikel and Spanish calendars. The Schele and Fahsen dates are used in this section. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.386.n15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaqchikel kings provided native soldiers to assist the conquistadors against continuing K'iche' resistance and to help with the defeat of the neighbouring Tz'utuhil kingdom.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p297"/&gt; The Spanish only stayed briefly in Iximche before continuing through Atitlán, [[Escuintla]] and [[Cuscatlán Department|Cuscatlán]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated297"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.297. Recinos 1998, p.101. Guillemín 1965, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish returned to the Kaqchikel capital on 23 July 1524 and on 27 July (''1 Q'at'' in the Kaqchikel calendar) Pedro de Alvarado declared Iximche as the first capital of Guatemala, [[Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]] ("St. James of the Knights of Guatemala").&lt;ref name="autogenerated297"/&gt;

Pedro de Alvarado rapidly began to demand gold in tribute from the Kaqchikels, souring the friendship between the two peoples.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p298"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.298.&lt;/ref&gt; He demanded that the Kaqchikel kings deliver 1000 gold leaves each of 15 [[peso]]s.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p25"/&gt; A Kaqchikel priest foretold that the Kaqchikel gods would destroy the Spanish and the Kaqchikel people abandoned their city and fled to the forests and hills on 28 August 1524 (''7 Ahmak'' in the Kaqchikel calendar).&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p298"/&gt; Ten days later the Spanish declared war on the Kaqchikel.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p298"/&gt; A couple of years later, on 9 February 1526, a group of sixteen Spanish deserters burnt the palace of the ''Ahpo Xahil'', sacked the temples and kidnapped a priest, acts that the Kaqchikel blamed on Pedro de Alvarado.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp.298, 310, 386n19. Recinos 1998, p.19. gives ''sixty'' deserters.&lt;/ref&gt; Conquistador [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] recounted how in 1526 he returned to Iximche and spent the night in the "old city of Guatemala" together with Luis Marín and other members of [[Hernán Cortés]]'s expedition to Honduras.&lt;ref name="autogenerated298"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.298. Recinos 1998, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; He reported that the houses of the city were still in excellent condition, his account was the last description of the city while it was still inhabitable.&lt;ref name="autogenerated298"/&gt;

The Spanish founded a new town at [[Tecpán Guatemala]], with ''Tecpán'' being Nahuatl for "palace", so the name of the new town translated as "the palace among the trees".&lt;ref name="Schele 1999, pp.299"/&gt; The inhabitants of Iximche were dispersed, with some being moved to Tecpán, others to [[Sololá]] and to other towns around [[Lake Atitlán]].&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p299"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.299.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spaniards]] abandoned Tecpán in 1527, due to the continuous Kaqchikel attacks, and moved to the Almolonga Valley to the east, refounding their capital on the site of today's [[San Miguel Escobar]] district of [[Ciudad Vieja]], near [[Antigua Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Lutz 1997, pp.10, 258. Ortiz Flores 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kaqchikel kept up resistance against the Spanish for a number of years but on 9 May 1530 the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p298"/&gt; A day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people came with them to surrender at the new Spanish capital at Ciudad Vieja.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p298"/&gt;

===Modern history===
[[File:Iximche George W Bush Handshake.jpg|thumb|right|US President George W. Bush at Iximche in 2007]]
The ruins were described by Guatemalan historian [[Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán]] in 1695.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p14"/&gt; Miguel Rivera Maestre published some plans and views of the ruins in 1834 in his ''Atlas del Estado de Guatemala'' ("Atlas of the State of Guatemala").&lt;ref name="Recinos98p20"&gt;Recinos 1998, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; American diplomat and writer [[John Lloyd Stephens]] described the ruins, which he called ''Patinamit'', after he visited Iximche with English artist [[Frederick Catherwood]] and in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.15. Kelly 1996, p.195.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherwood never published any drawings of the site and Stephens reported that the locals had plundered the stone at the site for many years in order to use it for building materials in Tecpán.&lt;ref name="Kelly 1996, pp.195-196"/&gt; French architect Cesar Daly mapped Iximche in 1857.&lt;ref name="Recinos98p20"/&gt;

In Spanish Colonial times Iximche was the focus of a [[syncretism|syncretic]] cult worshipping a relic from the ruins that had been transferred to the church in Tecpán.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p48"/&gt; As late as the 19th century processions to the ruins from Tecpán took place every [[Good Friday]].&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p48"/&gt; This cult had died out by the time of the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p48"/&gt;

[[Alfred P. Maudslay]] visited Iximche in 1887 and referred to it both as ''Patinamit'' and ''Iximche''.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p196"&gt;Kelly 1996, p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; He carried out a site survey and published a plan of the ruins.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p196"/&gt; [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]] carried out a ceramic study of Iximche in the 1940s on behalf of the [[Middle American Research Institute]] of [[Tulane University]] and published his work in 1948&amp;ndash;1949.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p196"/&gt; Historian Janos de Szecsy began excavations at the ruins in January 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the city were excavated by Swiss-Guatemalan archaeologist George (Jorge) Guillemín from 1959-1972.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.299. Guillemín 1965, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Guillemín published his work in 1959, 1967 and 1969.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p196"/&gt; The excavation and restoration of the ruins was funded by the Guatemalan Committee for Reconstruction of National Monuments until July 1961, after 1963 the investigations were funded by the Swiss National Foundation for Scientific Research.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p25"/&gt; Guillemín died before his investigations could be completed and his full report published.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p45"/&gt; His field notes were finally published in 2003.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p45"/&gt;

[[File:Iximche Masked Dancers.jpg|thumb|left|Dancers and [[marimba]] performing at Iximche for the 2007 visit of the presidents of Guatemala and the United States]]
In 1960 the ruins of Iximche were declared a National Monument under governmental decree 1360 of the [[Congress of the Republic of Guatemala]], published in May 1963.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In 1980, during the Guatemalan Civil War, the ruins were chosen as a meeting place between Maya leaders and the guerillas, as a result of which the guerillas stated explicitly that they would defend indigenous rights in the so-called "Declaration of Iximche".&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p45"/&gt; In 1989 an important Maya ceremony was carried out at the site in order to reestablish the ruins as a sacred place for indigenous ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p48"/&gt;

[[United States]] [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] visited the site on March 12, 2007. Local Maya priests said that they would be conducting purifying rites after his visit to cleanse the area of "bad spirits" brought by the president, who they said persecuted their "migrant brothers" in the United States. "We reject this portrayal of our people as a tourist attraction," a spokesman, Morales Toj, said.&lt;ref name="BBC News, 12 March 2007"/&gt;

From 26&amp;ndash;30 March 2007 Iximche was the site of the III Continental Summit of Indigenous Peoples and Nationalities of Abya Yala.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The meeting's closing "Declaration of Iximche" committed delegates to a struggle for social justice and against "neoliberalism and other forms of oppression."&lt;ref&gt;Secretaría Cumbre Continental de Pueblos y Organizaciones Indígenas 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
The majority of visitors to Iximche are indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]], at the weekend the site attracts about 250 visitors per day.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p45"/&gt; Comparatively few tourists visit the ruins and the majority that do are Guatemalan nationals.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p45"/&gt; Modern ''aj q'ijab''' (Maya priests often referred to as "[[daykeeper]]s" in English) arrive as pilgrims at Iximche from throughout the Guatemalan Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Frühsorge 2007, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourist facilities at the site include visitor parking, a small museum, a picnic area and a football field.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p45"/&gt; The museum is open on a daily basis and displays a number of artefacts recovered from the ruins.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p197-198"&gt;Kelly 1996, pp.197-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==
[[File:Iximche map.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Map of the site core of Iximche, showing the principal structures of Plazas A&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;C]]
The site was largely preserved by the [[Spain|Spanish]] due to their alliance with the Kaqchikel against the K'iche'.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p9"/&gt; The site’s central core is flanked by deep ravines and is separated from the main residential area by a defensive ditch.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p14"/&gt; The city developed very quickly and within 50 years of its foundation it had reached its maximum extent.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p24"/&gt; This explosive population growth at the city caused the residential area to spill over into the edges of the ravines themselves.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p14"/&gt; The site center consists of four large and two small plazas, each of which contained at least two [[temple]]s.  Along with [[elite]] [[palace]]s, there are two [[Mesoamerican ballgame#The Court|ballcourts]], the larger of which is {{convert|40|m|ft}} long and had [[zoomorphic]] markers. The plazas are named A, B, C, D, E and F, running from northwest (A) to southeast (F).&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, pp.27-28. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.311.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremonial centre of the city was separated from the residential areas by a wall.&lt;ref name="Arroyo01p42"/&gt;

Today the ruins are accessed via the modern town of [[Tecpán Guatemala]], which replaced Iximche when it was destroyed.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p299"/&gt; The modern entrance to the site is on the northern side of the ruins and includes visitor parking, a small museum, a picnic area and a football field, as well as the custodian's house.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p45"/&gt; In an area of woodland to the south of the central portion of the ruins is a modern ceremonial area used by the modern Kaqchikel to carry out their rituals.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p45"/&gt; This ceremonial area is linked to the ruins by a footpath and includes six concrete altars arranged around an unexcavated building.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p45"/&gt; Flowers, food and drink are placed on these altars as sacrifices.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p45"/&gt; The museum displays a number of pieces from the site, including sculptures and ceramics.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p197-198"/&gt;

'''Plazas A''' and '''B''' are thought to have comprised a single complex belonging to the Sotz'il clan and included the palace of the ''Ahpo Sotz'il''.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p300"/&gt; Plaza A possesses a ballcourt, two temples and ten palace structures, five of which are interconnecting.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p29"&gt;Guillemin 1967, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iximché.JPG|thumb|left|View of Iximche with Structure 1 at left and Structure 2 at right.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, pp.25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Plaza C''' was separated from Plazas A and B by a {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}} wall and was the palace complex of the ''Ahpo Xahil'', the junior co-ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.309. Guillemin 1967, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Plaza C also had two temples facing each other across the plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.309.&lt;/ref&gt; The Xahil ballcourt was on the southwest side of Plaza C and the palace proper of the ''Ahpo Xahil'' was on the southeast side of the plaza.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p310"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.310.&lt;/ref&gt; The Xahil Palace was built with an east-west alignment with the entry courtyard on the western side of the palace and had a central altar.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p310"/&gt; The main palace was entered from the eastern side of the entry courtyard.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p310"/&gt; The rooms and courtyards of the Xahil Palace contained a great deal of domestic artefacts.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p310"/&gt; The Xahil Palace was destroyed by a major fire that resulted in the collapse of the adobe walls and it may be that this was the complex where Pedro de Alvarado was lodged with his Spanish soldiers.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p310"/&gt; It would also be the same building that Spanish deserters burned in 1526.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p310"/&gt; The collapse of the building preserved the domestic contents of the palace for archaeologists, unlike the palace of the ''Ahpo Sotz'il'' where comparatively few artefacts were recovered.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p310"/&gt;

'''Plaza D''' has not been excavated although it was cleared and mapped by archaeologists.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p311"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.311.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a large plaza surrounded by fairly high mounds although it does not appear to have had the large east and west pyramids present on the other main plazas.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p311"/&gt; It had a palace on the south side with three interior courtyards, the westernmost of which had a cross-shaped altar.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p311"/&gt; The palace was smaller than those of the ''Ahpo Sotz'il'' and the ''Ahpo Xahil'' and is believed to have been the palace of the ''Ahuchan''.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p311"/&gt;

'''Plazas E''' and '''F''' are to the east of Plaza D and also included palace buildings.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p311"/&gt; These plazas were not mapped by Guillemín and remain covered by trees.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p311"/&gt; The two plazas formed a single complex, believed to have been that of the ''K'alel Achi''.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p311"/&gt;

The defensive ditch running across the promontory was originally {{convert|8|m|ft}} deep.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p15"&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; It was largely filled in soon after the Conquest in order to render the city less defensible.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p15"/&gt; In the middle of the 19th century the defensive ditch was measured as {{convert|3|yd|m}} deep, in the 1960s it was still visible on the ground although it is now almost totally filled in.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p15"/&gt;

Ceramic finds at the site include frequent finds of incense-burners with handles and molded decoration. The most common domestic ceramics are of a [[mica]]ceous ware and include ceramic [[Comal (cookware)|comal]]s (a type of griddle).&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"/&gt; Imported ceramics include Chinautla Polychrome and White-on-red, they are reasonably common at the site.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"/&gt; Brown bowls are of a type also found in [[Zaculeu]] and [[Mixco Viejo]], both of which also had a Late Postclassic occupation.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"/&gt; Three-legged [[metate]]s (a kind of [[Mortar and pestle|mortar]]) were frequently recovered from the excavations and black [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] blades were found in great quantities.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"/&gt; Simple [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] jewellery was also found.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"/&gt;

Human sacrifice is evidenced at the site by the altar upon Structure 2, of a type used in heart sacrifice, and by a cylindrical cache of skulls taken from decapitated victims accompanied by obsidian knives.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"/&gt; A [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] flute crafted from a child's [[femur]] was recovered from one of the temples and is also indicative of human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the very brief nature of the Spanish occupation of the city, very few European artefacts were found.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p33"&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; Those few pieces that were found consisted of forged iron [[crossbow]] bolts.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p33"/&gt;

===Structures===
[[File:Iximche guatemala 2009.JPG|thumb|right|Temples 1 and 2 at Iximche]]
Over 160 structures have been mapped at Iximche.&lt;ref name="Arroyo01p42"&gt;Arroyo 2001, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; The structures were faced with stone blocks that were coated in [[lime plaster]], which in some cases was then painted with Mixtec-Puebla style murals, although few traces of the murals survive today.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p192Guillemin67p29"&gt;Kelly 1996, p.192. Guillemin 1967, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mixtec-Puebla style originated around AD 900 in central Mexico and spread from there throughout Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p301"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.301.&lt;/ref&gt; The superstructures of buildings at Iximche were built from [[adobe]] blocks and once supported beam and mortar roofs but none have survived.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p192Guillemin67p29"/&gt; The platform cores were generally built of rough stones set in a [[clay]] [[Matrix (archaeology)|matrix]].&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p29"/&gt; A few of the structures have been restored and the site core is kept clear of overgrowth.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p192"/&gt; Residential structures built on platforms around the ceremonial plazas usually had built-in benches and hearths.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p27"&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Great Palace I====
The '''Great Palace I''' (or '''Gran Palacio I''' in Spanish) is a large residential complex on the northeast side of Plaza B.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.192. Guillemin 1967, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving remains consist of a sunken patio and some low house platforms.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p192"/&gt; Excavation revealed three construction phases, the earliest of which dates to the founding of the city by Wuqu-Batz' and Hun-Toh.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.192. Guillemín 1965, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; This phase covered approximately {{convert|500|m2|sqft}} and came to form the core of the palace.&lt;ref name=Guillemin65p24/&gt; The first phase consisted of four long single-roomed residential range structures arranged around a courtyard, which possessed an altar in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.24. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.307.&lt;/ref&gt; The residential units possessed inset benches against the walls and hearths in the middle of the floorspace.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p24"/&gt; The walls were originally built of adobe covered with painted murals.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p24"/&gt; Artefacts recovered from this phase included [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] knives, comals, metates and domestic ceramics.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p24"/&gt; Fragments of [[censer|incense burners]] were recovered close to the altars in the palace.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p24"/&gt; The Palace expanded in all directions around this early core with the addition of new buildings and courtyards.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p24"/&gt; The early courtyard was later divided into several smaller patios.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p307"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.307.&lt;/ref&gt; The last phase of construction at the Palace dates to the joint reign of Hun-Iq' and Lajuj Noj, by the end of which the palace covered an area of more than {{convert|3000|m2|sqft}}.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p24"/&gt;

On the southwest of the palace courtyard there were some low platforms, possibly ritual dance platforms, and on the southeast side was a building with benches against three of the walls and hearths at each end.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p307"/&gt; This may have been the room where the ''Ahpo Sotz'il'' held court and received visitors and tribute.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp.307-308.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Great Palace II====
The '''Great Palace II''' (or '''Gran Palacio II''' in Spanish) is another large residential complex, it is located on the southeast side of Plaza C.&lt;ref name="Nance98p200"&gt;Nance 1998, p.200.&lt;/ref&gt; The palace is formed by a large number of small rooms arranged around seven interior courtyards.&lt;ref&gt;Nance 1998, pp.200, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; A large quantity of ceramic remains were recovered from within this palace.&lt;ref name="Nance98p200"/&gt; The rooms around the northeast courtyard within the Great Palace II may have been the royal apartments of this complex, owing to their position near the central courtyard while at the same time being closed off from it.&lt;ref&gt;Nance 1998, p.210.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceramics from this area were of exotic origin and elite nature.&lt;ref&gt;Nance 1998, pp.210-211.&lt;/ref&gt; The royal apartments may also have included the rooms around the north courtyard of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Nance 1998, p.212.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Temple 2====
[[File:Iximche Temple 2.jpg|thumb|left|Temple 2 at Iximche and its ''itzompan'' ("skull place") at bottom left]]
'''Temple 2''' (also known as '''Structure 2''') is a tiered [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramidal]] platform on the west side of Plaza A. It has a stairway that climbs the east side of the structure, providing access from the plaza.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p192"/&gt; Structure 2 faces the sunrise on the [[summer solstice]].&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p301"/&gt; The structure is the best preserved of the excavated temples.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p27"/&gt; Like many buildings at Iximche it had three construction phases dating, from oldest to newest, from the reigns of Wuqu-Batz', Oxlahuh Tz'i' and Hun-Iq'.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p301"/&gt; The earliest of these phases was located by archaeologists tunnelling into the interior of the structure.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p27"/&gt; It is poorly preserved because the facing stones were stripped in order to be reused.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p27"/&gt; The middle phase is the best preserved of the three phases of construction and consisted of four stepped tiers supporting high [[talud-tablero]] style walls consisting of a sloping wall topped by a vertical panel.&lt;ref name="autogenerated28"&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.28. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.301.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple had recessed corners and a steep stairway climbed to the topmost tier, at the top of the stair was a {{convert|40|cm|in|adj=mid|-high}} sacrificial altar measuring {{convert|45|cm|in}} wide by {{convert|18|cm|in}} deep.&lt;ref name="autogenerated28"/&gt; The altar was made from stone and [[stucco]] and the top was slightly concave, it is of a type used in [[Sacrifice in Maya culture#Human sacrifice|human sacrifice]].&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p28"&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple floor is elevated {{convert|9|m|ft}} above the plaza and the temple superstructure, including both the temple walls and the roof, would have added another {{convert|5|m|ft}} to the total height of the structure at the time of the Spanish Conquest.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p28"/&gt; The temple shrine had benches built against three sides of the interior and a hearth in the middle.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p29"&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt; A small rear chamber also had benches,&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p29"/&gt; this chamber may have been where the gods of the Sotz'il were kept.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p301"/&gt; A small section of the temple floor had been opened as if to receive a burial but the tomb was never used and was covered over again.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p28"/&gt; The remains of a turtle were excavated from the plaza immediately in front of the temple and may have represented one of the ''[[bacab]]s'' (a class of mythical being) that supported the temple.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p28"/&gt; Turtles also played an important part in the Classic Period Maya myth of the rebirth of the Maize God.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p301"/&gt;

The temple shrine was built on a final platform on top of the fourth tier.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p28"/&gt; The exposed remains of the shrine date to the reign of Oxlahuh-Tz'i'.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p301"/&gt; It had a triple doorway divided by columns and was built from [[adobe]] covered with plaster, the columns and walls on eithers side of the doorways were painted with decorations, traces of red, yellow and blue were found by archaeologists, these colours were applied to designs marked out onto a thin cap of clay with a pointed instrument.&lt;ref name="autogenerated28"/&gt; The quality of the work was very fine and indicated execution by a specialised artist.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p28"/&gt; There were ten painted figures on the front of the building with further murals on the back.&lt;ref name="autogenerated28"/&gt; The designs consist of two rows of discs on top of a row of vertical stripes with figures painted against the striped background with the discs above them.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p302-303"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp.302-303.&lt;/ref&gt; The painted figures are performing various actions, one of which is [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|tongue piercing]],&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p28"/&gt; and they probably represent a Kaqchikel ritual in progress.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p301"/&gt; The painted murals are very poorly preserved due to deterioration caused by damp combined with damage caused by tree roots.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p29"/&gt; The style of the paintings is very similar to that of Postclassic [[Mixtec]] art.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p29"/&gt; Exposed parts of the middle phase of construction were damaged and the second phase was covered by the final construction phase, which was badly damaged by the stonework being stripped away for building the nearby town of Tecpán.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p27"/&gt;

At the southwest corner of Temple 2 is a low platform that bore painted murals that had a skull with crossed longbones upon two bands of decoration.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p302-303"/&gt; This platform may have been an ''itzompan'' or "skull place", a Kaqchikel version of the Aztec ''[[tzompantli]]'' skull racks.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp.303, 387n24.&lt;/ref&gt; Two skulls bearing evidence of decapitation were found in a cache to the southeast of Temple 2 together with some obsidian blades.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p33"&gt;Guillemin 1967, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Temple 3====
'''Temple 3''' (also known as '''Structure 3''') is a pyramid-temple located on the east side of Plaza A, opposite Temple 2, and is similar in form to that building.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.192. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.303.&lt;/ref&gt; The stairway climbs the west (plaza) side of the temple platform.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p192"/&gt; In front of the stairway, at the level of the plaza, is a small rectangular platform.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p192"/&gt; A large amount of ceramic remains were found associated with this building, these were pieces of large cylindrical incense-burners, of which more than twelve were used in the temple.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p29"/&gt; One represented an elderly god emerging from the jaws of a serpent, another two show the same deity in a standing position.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p303"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.303.&lt;/ref&gt; They may represent one of the patrion deities of the Kaqchikel, B'elehe-Toh or Hun-Tihax.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p303"/&gt; The incense burners were found exactly where the Kaqchikels had left them when they abandoned Iximche.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p303"/&gt; Some of these incense-burners bore a suspended solar disc with modelled rays.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p29"/&gt; Fragments of an [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Postclassic]] [[plumbate ware]] vessel were recovered scattered around three sides of the temple that were probably the remains of a relic from within the temple itself.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p29"/&gt; There is no evidence of such early occupation at Iximche and may have been plundered from [[Zaculeu]], a city with a long occupational history that was conquered by the K'iche'-Kaqchikel alliance.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p29"/&gt; A sacrificial [[flint]] knife was also recovered from Structure 3.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p30"/&gt; Two low platforms stand in front of the temple, they were likely to have been used either as altars or as dance platforms.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p304"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.304.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other structures====
'''Structure 1''' (also known as '''Temple 1''') is a pyramid temple facing onto Plaza B.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p192"/&gt; It is the only temple at Iximche to have been completely restored.&lt;ref name="Fruhsorge07p45"/&gt;

'''Structure 4''' is another pyramid-temple base on the west side of Plaza C.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.195.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a low platform at its southeastern corner, where 48 severed heads were excavated immediately to the west.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p310"/&gt; Schele and Mathews have speculated that these may be the heads of the K'iche' kings Tepupul and Itzayul together with other members of the K'iche' court who were captured by the Kaqchikels and decapitated.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p310"/&gt; Most of the skulls were found with associated obsidian blades.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p33"/&gt; Most of the skulls had been individually buried in pits cut into the floor of the plaza, although a few were grouped into small lots.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p33"/&gt;

'''Structure 5''' was a pyramid-temple.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p32"&gt;Guillemin 1967, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavation revealed at least two phases of construction and the pyramidal platform had a single stair that divided into two as it approached the summit shrine.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p32"/&gt;

'''Structure 6''' is an unrestored temple-pyramid platform to the southwest of Plaza C.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, pp.192, 195. Guillemin 1967, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 7''', at the southwest side of Plaza C, is a ballcourt of similar dimensions to Structure 8.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.192. Guillemín 1965, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the ballcourt of the Xahil clan and may have been the older of the two ballcourts.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.310. Guillemin 1967, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Each end of the ballcourt had a projecting stairway and there was an additional stairway to the southeast.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p32"/&gt; A tennoned head sculpture recovered from Plaza C may originally have been a ballcourt marker from this ballcourt.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p32"/&gt;

[[File:Iximche4.jpg|thumb|right|Structure 8, a sunken ballcourt on the southwestern side of Plaza A]]
'''Structure 8''' is located at the southwestern side of Plaza A. It is a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} I-shaped ball-court with a {{convert|30|by|7|m|ft}} playing area.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p27"/&gt; The end-zones are enclosed and accessed via stairways.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p192"/&gt; The two lateral platforms enclosing the playing area were extended by building onto the outermost side.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p27"/&gt; In Kaqchikel ballcourts were called ''hom'' and were seen as gateways to [[Xibalba]], the underworld.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p304"/&gt; Structure 8 has been excavated and restored.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p31"&gt;Guillemin 1967, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations uncovered two levels of plaster flooring, indicating that the ballcourt had been built during the second of the three main phases of construction at Iximche, dating it to about AD 1500.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p31"/&gt;

'''Structure 9-sub''' had two pillars separating three doorways.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p27"/&gt;

'''Structure 10''' had an internal patio with the building surrounding it on three sides.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p27"/&gt;

'''Structure 13''', lying between Plazas A and B, had an internal patio with the structure enclosing it on three sides, much like Structure 10.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p27"/&gt;

'''Structure 14''' is a circular altar in Plaza B measuring {{convert|3.5|m|ft}} across.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p32"&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is very similar to those used for so-called "[[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|gladiatorial sacrifice]]" by the Aztecs and it may have served this purpose.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p32"/&gt; This hypothesis is supported by the presence of a noble burial interred with three companions.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p32"/&gt;

'''Structure 22''' is a range structure on the north side of Plaza A.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 1996, p.192. Guillemín 1965, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; The bases of pillars survive that once separated five doorways.&lt;ref name="Kelly96p192"/&gt; Structure 22 is one of the best preserved palace platforms at Iximche and had benches set against the inside of three of the walls and hearths set into the floor.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p29"/&gt;

'''Structure 24''' - two crude tennoned zoomorphic heads, possibly jaguar heads, were found near this structure but were probably ballcourt markers from one of the two ballcourts.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p27"/&gt; It is likely that they served as a core onto which [[stucco]] modelling was applied.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p27"/&gt;

'''Structure 27''' is located behind Temple 2.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p306"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.306.&lt;/ref&gt; Within it was found the noble tomb E-27-A.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p306"/&gt;

'''Structure 38''' is a {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}} long platform that completely enclosed the north side of Plaza C.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p32"/&gt; It supported three residential structures, each of which had its own stairway.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p32"/&gt; Domestic ceramics were found associated with these buildings.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p32"/&gt; An incense burner was also found with an effigy of [[Tlaloc]], the central Mexican rain god.&lt;ref name="Guillemin67p32"/&gt;

===Human remains===
The skeletal remains of more than 100 individuals have been excavated at Iximche, some of which were very well preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Whittington &amp; Reed 1998, pp.73-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately the bones became mixed when warehoused near the site after excavation and their original locations are no longer clear.&lt;ref&gt;Whittington &amp; Reed 1998, p.74.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-six skulls were analysed by archaeologists, of these 25 show evidence of decapitation, a sacrificial practice commonly represented in [[Maya art]] from the Classic Period.&lt;ref&gt;Whittington &amp; Reed 1998, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen of these sacrifices were male, seven were female and five were of indeterminate gender.&lt;ref name="WhittingtonReed98p76"&gt;Whittington &amp; Reed 1998, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the sacrifices were of young adults, ten were aged between 15 and 21 years old and eleven were aged little more than 21 years old, based on skull development.&lt;ref name="WhittingtonReed98p76"/&gt; It is likely that these sacrificed individuals were not Kaqchikels but were captives taken from enemy states.&lt;ref name="WhittingtonReed98p76"/&gt; Less than 3% of the analysed skulls showed evidence of [[iron deficiency anemia]], a very low percentage compared with remains recovered from [[Copán]] and [[Altar de Sacrificios]] (64% and 88% respectively).&lt;ref name="WhittingtonReed98p76"/&gt; This low percentage indicates that these individuals were not exposed to particular dietary stress and were likely to belong to the elite class.&lt;ref name="WhittingtonReed98p77"&gt;Whittington &amp; Reed 1998, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; 31% of the skulls had evidence of infection, about half of which were active infections at the time of death, although none were serious.&lt;ref name="WhittingtonReed98p77"/&gt; Half of these infections left evidence in the [[maxillary sinus]], this suggests a fairly high level of airborne [[pathogen]]s in the environment.&lt;ref name="WhittingtonReed98p77"/&gt; [[Tooth enamel]] analysis was carried out on 19 individuals and revealed [[hypoplasia]] in the teeth of 89% of these, indicating a high level of poor health in the first 7 years of childhood.&lt;ref name="WhittingtonReed98p77"/&gt;

All excavated tombs were intrusive burials interred under residential platforms.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p32"/&gt; They were all found in a [[squatting position]] without any particular orientation.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p32"/&gt; Many of the remains were found accompanied by a broken obsidian blade.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p32"/&gt; Some burials had other offerings, for example that of a woman accompanied by domestic utensils, some of which were blackened with soot.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p32"/&gt; Two child burials each had a jade bead and the burial of an elderly male was accompanied by pieces of burnt pine and [[Live oak|evergreen oak]].&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p32"/&gt;

'''Burial E-27-A''' was a noble tomb in Structure 27, in Plaza A.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, pp.21-22, 32. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, pp.306-307.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of three sacrificed adults were piled together face down in a {{convert|1|m2|sqft}} space.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.32. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.306.&lt;/ref&gt; Under these sacrifices were the seated remains of another person.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p32"/&gt; This individual wore a gold headband with a jade and [[turquoise]] mosaic and a necklace with ten representations of jaguar heads together with forty small gold beads.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, pp.32-33. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.306.&lt;/ref&gt; On each arm he wore a bracelet fashioned from the [[occipital bone]] of a human skull and engraved with fine designs that included birds and stars hanging from a Mexican-style celestial band.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p33"/&gt; A finely crafted piece of jade was found near the lower jaw and had probably been originally placed within the mouth of the deceased.&lt;ref name="Guillemin65p33"/&gt; There was also a copper nose ornament in the shape of the moon and some jade beads, one of which represented a deity similar to that represented on the incense burners found at Temple 3.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p306"/&gt; The remains dated from the earlier phase of occupation of Iximche and the deceased had died in battle from a blow to the head from a blunt instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, p.33. Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.306.&lt;/ref&gt; The burial has been tentatively identified as that of one of two sons of Wuqu-Batz' of the Xahil clan, who died in the Kaqchikel wars of expansion,&lt;ref&gt;Guillemín 1965, pp.21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; either Chopena-Tz'i'kin Uka or Chopena-Tohin.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p307"/&gt;

'''Jewish paper cutting''' is a traditional form of [[Jewish]] [[folk art]] made by cutting figures and sentences in paper or [[parchment]]. 
It is connected with various customs and ceremonies, and associated with holidays and family life. Paper cuts often decorated [[Ketubah|ketubbot]] (marriage contracts), [[Mizrah]]s, and ornaments for festive occasions.  Paper cutting was practiced by Jewish communities in both Eastern Europe and North Africa and the Middle East for centuries and has seen a revival in modern times in Israel and elsewhere.

== History ==
[[File:Swiat. Agata Szepe 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish papercut "The World" &lt;br/&gt;by Agata Szepe]]

=== Origins ===
The origin of Jewish paper cutting is unclear. [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries practiced this type of art. However, Jewish paper cuts can be traced to Jewish communities in Syria, Iraq, and North Africa, and the similarity in the cutting techniques (using a knife) between East European Jews and [[Chinese paper cutting|Chinese paper cutters]], may indicate that the origin goes back even further. Some contend that Ashkenazi paper-cutting may date to the 14th century, though its popularity reached a zenith in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The first mention of Jewish paper cutting can be found in the treatise "The fight of the pen and the scissors” by a 14th-century rabbi, Shem Tov ben Isaac ben Ardutiel (1290-1369), who describes how he decided to cut letters in paper when his ink became frozen during a harsh winter. To students of Christian Spanish literary history, Rabbi Shem Tov is known as Santob de Carrion de los Condes, the courtly [[Castilian people|Castilian]] troubadour who composed the Proverbios morales for Pedro the Cruel.&lt;ref name=MyJewishLearning-JewishPapercutting&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shadur |first1=Joseph |title=Jewish Papercutting: Folk art even the poorest folk could create |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/2/Art/History_and_Theory/Jewish_Folk_Art/Jewish_Papercuts.shtml?p=0 |website=My Jewish Learning |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107002727/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/2/Art/History_and_Theory/Jewish_Folk_Art/Jewish_Papercuts.shtml?p=0 |archivedate=2015-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper cutting as a folk craft gained popularity in the nineteenth century when paper became a cheap material.&lt;ref name=ZygmuntFrankel-1&gt;{{cite web|last=Frankel|first=Giza|title=The Art of the Jewish Papercut |url=http://www.zygmuntfrankel.com/jewishpapercut.html |work=ZygmuntFrankel.com |publisher=Etcetera Editions|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper cutting was widespread among the [[Jews of Poland]] and [[Jews of Russia|Russia]] in the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century. Jewish paper cuts were also produced in Germany and probably in the Netherlands. Some [[Jews of Italy|Italian Jewish]] [[parchment]] ketubot (marriage contracts) from the late 17th century until the nineteenth century were decorated paper cuts as well as some elaborate scrolls of the [[Book of Esther]]. Similar paper cuttings from Jewish communities North Africa and the Middle East have some characteristic style differences.

It was popular among Jews both in eastern and western Europe as well as in Turkey, Morocco, Syria, Bangladesh, Israel, and North America.&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska&gt;{{cite book|last=Gołąb|first=Marta|title=Jewish paper-cut = Wycinanka żydowska|year=2006|publisher=Wydawnictwo "Hagada"|location=Kraków|isbn=9788391507605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Africa and the Middle East paper cuts were called a "Menorah", because one or more [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], always appeared as the central motif. These paper cuts included many inscriptions, mostly on the arms of the candelabras. The paper was mounted on thin, colored metal sheets. Two distinct kinds were produced: a Mizrah and smaller paper cuts used as charms. The motifs are the same as in European Jewish paper cuts but they have a distinctive Eastern style. Also, the [[hamsa]] ("the five-finger hand"), unknown in Europe, very often appears on these paper cuts.

=== Disappearance ===
Jewish paper cutting began disappearing in the first half of the twentieth century, mainly because of the rapid assimilation trends and the waning of many traditional practices, and was practiced only by older people who remembered this art form from their youth. Many paper cuts collections that had been preserved were destroyed during [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]] and relatively few remain in public or private collections.

=== Resurgence ===
Since the late twentieth century, Jewish paper cuts have again become a popular art form in both [[Israel]] and other countries. Paper cutting is again often used to decorate [[ketubot]], wedding invitations, and works of art. To a limited extent, Jewish paper cuts have become more popular in Poland as a result of the [[Jewish Culture Festival in Kraków]], a festival that has been held in [[Kraków]] since the 1990s.

[[Beit Hatefutsot]] – The Museum of the Jewish People in [[Tel Aviv, Israel]] presented a 2009 exhibition called "The Revival of Jewish Papercuts: Jewish paper cut art" in October 2009. The exhibit was curated by Prof. Olga Goldberg, Gabriella Rabbi, Rina Biran, the Giza Frenkel Papercut Archive, the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Additionally, a [[National Science Foundation]]-funded study called “Tradition and Continuity in Jewish Papercuts” was conducted by Prof. Olga Goldberg.&lt;ref name=BeitHatfutsot-exhibition&gt;{{cite web|title=The Revival of Jewish Papercuts: Jewish paper cut art|url=http://www.bh.org.il/event/revival-jewish-papercuts/|publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |location=Tel Aviv, Israel|date=October 1, 2009 – January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Oren Loloi writes that the art of Jewish papercutting's resurgence is due in large part to the efforts of Polish-Jewish anthropologist and ethnologist Giza Frankel (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loloi|first1=Oren|title=What is Jewish paper-cutting?|url=https://www.papercutsbyoren.com/jewish-papercutting/|website=Paper Cuts by Oren|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.worldcat.org/title/migzerot-neyar-omanut-yehudit-amamit/oclc/27227163 Frankel's 1983 book], ''The Art of the Jewish Papercut'' (Migzerot neyar: omanut Yehudit amamit), was produced after 50 years of painstaking research. 

Today, Jewish papercut art has grown in popularity beyond ritual items to art and expressions of Jewish faith, not only in Israel but worldwide. Loloi contends that the resurgence in papercutting's popularity is in part due to its contemporary near-ubiquity as part of the [[ketubah]] (marriage contract), which is a contemporary site of ''hiddur mitzvah'', the Jewish principle of honouring the Divine by beautifying ritual objects. Contemporary papercutting art may also be seen in amulets like [[Hamsa|hamsas]], [[Birkat HaBayit|blessings for the home]], [[Mizrah#Mizrah_in_Jewish_homes|mizrahim]], and other art pieces, usually as a wall plaque.

=== Giza Frankel ===
In Israel papercutting was reactivated by Giza Frankel, a Polish-born ethnographer.&lt;ref name=Lauder-Frankel&gt;{{cite web|title=Frenkel (Frankel), Giza (1895 Wieliczka - 1984 Hajfa)|url=http://www.lauder.pl/frenkel-frankel-giza|work=Lauder Dzieje Żydów}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frankel's most significant publications on paper cutting are ''Wycinanka żydowska w Polsce'' and ''Art of the Jewishpaper-cut.''&lt;ref name=Goldberg-Munkiewicz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldberg-Munkiewicz|first=Olga|title=Giza Frankel - Migzerot Nijar Omanut Jehudit Amamit Giwataiim 1983, wyd.

He has also been commissioned by synagogues in New York and Virginia for large scale works.&lt;ref name="Modern Jewish Wedding - Papercuts by Oren"&gt;{{cite web|title=Custom Cut Ketubot and More - Papercuts by Oren|url=http://www.allthingspaper.net/2013/09/custom-cut-ketubot-and-more-papercuts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types ===
Depending on their purpose, shape and connection with specific religious and non-religious events, paper cuts are of different types.&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce&gt;{{cite book|last=Fränklowa|first=Giza|title=Wycinanka zydowska w Polsce: (Papierschnitte bei den Juden in Polen)|year=1929 |publisher=Nakł Towarzystwa Ludoznawczego |location=Lwów |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10628388|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–57}}

A Mizrah (hebr. The East) is a plaque hung on the east wall of private houses to show the direction of Jerusalem. A shivis’i (hebr. always) is similar to a mizrah, but it hangs on the east side of a synagogue. Its name is connected with a sentence from the Bible: 'Shivis'i adonai l'negdi tamid' ('I have set the LORD always before me').&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|4}} Shivis’i in the form of paper cuts rather than some more durable material were only used in poor synagogues.

There were also various paper cuts made for special, religious celebrations. Shevuoslekh ("little Shavuots") and ''royzelekh'' (rosettes) decorated windows for [[Shavuot]]. Royzelekh are circle-shaped paper cuts, while Shevuoslekh are rectangular. They were often made by pupils in elementary Jewish religious schools ([[Cheder]]s). They were sometimes decorated with motifs unconnected to religion, such as soldiers or riders.

Flags for [[Simchat Torah|Simchat-Torah]] were also made by ''cheder'' pupils. Created from colourful paper, each paper cut symbolized one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The other side of the paper showed an image of Torah with moving doors cut in paper. Paper cuts made for Sukkot were formed into lanterns, chains and birds, hung in [[Sukkah]]s.

Paper cuts often decorated a plaque with a prayer called Ushpizin, made for Sukkot. Paper cuts were also created for Purim, often containing the Hebrew sentence: ”Mishenekhnas adar marbin b’simcha’ (‘We should rejoice because (the month of) Adar begins') and cut into an image of a bottle and glasses, a symbol of rejoicing.&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|11}}

Papercutting also has connections with other forms of Jewish tradition. For example, [[Ketubah]]s (marriage agreements) were sometimes prepared in the form of paper cut, or decorated with paper cutting elements. Also cut into paper, memorial plaques were made to commemorate the names of ancestors’ names and dates of birth and death. Lanterns with papercut walls were placed in synagogues for anniversaries of great men’s death.&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|10–11}} Amulets like a [[Hamsa]] often showed an image of a palm with an eye on it.

== Characteristics ==

=== Features ===
Paper cuts traditionally were created with the use of shoemaker’s knife. It is likely that most artists were men, though in later years, schoolgirls (and boys) made little rosettes (called ''royzelekh'' or ''reyzelekh'' in [[Yiddish]]) with scissors, to decorate their notebooks or for holiday decorations in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Michlic|first1=Joanna Beata|title=Toys and Games|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Toys_and_Games|website=YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist first drew the pattern on a paper or parchment, and then cut it. Sometimes, they painted their work in watercolors. Paper cuts were usually glued to a contrasting background in a specific way, to bring the cut paper into relief. Hebrew sentences were important element of the composition. The words were either cut or drawn on paper. Elements of [[micrography]], another traditional type of Jewish folk art, can be seen in these blocks of text created with the artist's knife. Due to [[Aniconism in Judaism|Judaism's aniconism]], it is rare to see a paper-cut from this period that depicts the human figure. Exceptions are Sephardic [[Ketubot]] depicting the bride and bridegroom.&lt;ref name="Wycinanka-zydowska" /&gt;

=== Styles ===
Traditionally, paper cuts made by [[Sephardic]] and Ashkenazi Jews differed from each other. Ashkenazi papercuts were rich, highly detailed, and colourful. In this style, artists tried to fill the free space with as many elements as is possible. By contrast, the Sephardic compositions were more minimalist, including motifs such as the menorah, columns, [[Arabesque|arabesques]] and lanterns.&lt;ref name="Wycinanka-zydowska" /&gt; Modern Jewish paper cut art is done in many styles and is not limited to the aforementioned symbols and motifs. They may be single-layered or multi-layered.

=== Symbols ===
Every element of Jewish paper cut has its own symbolism. Some are typical of general Jewish culture, others are peculiar to the art of paper cutting. The most important symbols are placed along the [[axis of symmetry]].

The main symbols are usually a [[Torah]] or a [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]:
* The image of the Torah symbolizes God’s law, Judaism, Israel. The [[Star of David]] symbolizes Judaism and Israel
* The Menorah symbolizes Israel, Judaism, and [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The middle flame is a symbol of ‘[[Shekinah]]’ (Hebrew for God’s presence); the other flames are shown as leaning towards the main flame. The bottom of the menorah is often shown as a complicated ornament symbolizing [[infinity]]

A range of animals are depicted in paper cuts:
* [[Lions]], a biblical symbol of the [[Tribe of Judah]], are associated with strength, bravery, power&lt;ref name=Litin-KehilaLinks&gt;{{cite web|title="Mizrah" Papercut for a Succah - Litin, Ukraine - 1858|url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/litin/papercut.html|work=Litin, Ukraine|publisher=JewishGen|format=KehilaLinks}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Deer]] symbolize the [[Tribe of Naphtali]]&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name=Shivtei-Yisrael&gt;{{cite web|last=Mael|first=Rabbi Fishel|title=Characteristics of the Tribe of Naphtali|url=http://www.britam.org/mael/Mael13Naphtali.html|work=Shivtei Yisrael|publisher=Brit-Am}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Birds]] are associated with the human soul 
* [[Fish]] are usually connected with fertility
* A [[squirrel]] biting a nut symbolizes the effort put into reading the Torah
* The Four Animals (a [[leopard]], an [[eagle]], a [[gazelle]], and a [[lion]]) are connected with a sentence from [[Pirkei Avot]]: “Be strong as the leopard, swift as the eagle, fleet as the gazelle, and brave as the lion to do the will of your Father in Heaven”&lt;ref name=Mishnah-Pirkei-Avot&gt;{{cite web|title=Mishnah Pirkei Avot|url=http://www.shechem.org/torah/avot.html#chap5|work=Ethics Of The Fathers|location=Chapter 5, Number 23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190001/http://www.shechem.org/torah/avot.html#chap5|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[snake eating its own tail]] symbolizes [[infinity]]&lt;ref name="Wycinanka-zydowska" /&gt;

Papercut flora is usually connected with the biblical [[Tree of Life]],&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|6}} with some of the plants having their specific symbolism. For example, [[vine]] was associated with the land of Israel and with fertility, [[pomegranates]] symbolized fertility, etc.

Others symbols were connected both with tradition and with everyday life:
* [[Signs of the Zodiac]] showed the sequence of Jewish celebrations during the year
* Often positioned above the Torah or a Menorah, the crown is a symbol of God, the Torah, the Kingdom of Israel or the Priesthood&lt;ref name=Wycinanka-zydowska-w-Polsce /&gt;{{rp|5}} 
* Columns and other [[wikt:architectonic|architectonic]] elements are associated with the Temple in Jerusalem
* Hands with joined thumbs are a gesture of blessing
* A jug filled with water and a bowl symbolize the [[Tribe of Levi]], blessing or the Priesthood

== Methodology ==
The images are created by cutting a design into a folded piece of paper. When the paper is unfolded, the symmetrical design is revealed.&lt;ref name=Bib-Arch-Shadur&gt;{{cite web|last=Shadur|first=Yehudit|title=How Yehudit Shadur Makes a Paper-Cut|url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBR&amp;Volume=2&amp;Issue=2&amp;ArticleID=14|work=BR (Bible Review)|date=Summer 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper can be cut using either scissors or a craft knife.

The ancient site at '''Kot Diji''' ({{lang-ur|کوٹ ڈیجی}}) was the forerunner of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Civilization]]. The occupation of this site is attested already at 3300 BCE. The remains consist of two parts; the citadel area on high ground (about 12&amp;nbsp;m), and outer area. The Pakistan Department of Archaeology excavated at Kot Diji in 1955 and 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Possehl, Gregory L. (2004). ''The Indus Civilization: A contemporary perspective'', New Delhi: Vistaar Publications, {{ISBN|81-7829-291-2}}, pp.72-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Located about 24&amp;nbsp;kilometers south of [[Khairpur, Pakistan|Khairpur]] in the province of [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]], it is on the east bank of the Indus opposite [[Mohenjo-daro]].

The site is situated at the foot of the [[Rohri Hills]] where a fort ([[Kot Diji Fort]]) was built around 1790 by the Talpur dynasty ruler of Upper Sindh, Mir Suhrab, who reigned from 1783 to 1830&amp;nbsp;AD. This fort built on the ridge of a steep narrow hill is well-preserved.

==Historical significance==

===Early Harappan towns (4000–3000&amp;nbsp;BCE)===
The development of these farming communities in different parts of Baluchistan and Lower Sind ultimately led to urbanization. The earliest fortified town to date is found at [[Rehman Dheri]], dated 4000&amp;nbsp;BCE in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa close to [[Zhob River|River Zhob]] Valley. Other fortified towns found to date are at [[Amri (Pre-Harappa)|Amri]] (3600–3300&amp;nbsp;BCE) and Kot Diji in [[Sindh]] and at [[Kalibangan]] (3000&amp;nbsp;BCE), India at the [[Hakra]] River.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Keith Maisels, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=I2dgI2ijww8C&amp;pg=PA216 ''Early Civilizations of the Old World: The Formative Histories of Egypt, The Levant, Mesopotamia, India and China.''] Routledge, 2003 {{ISBN|1134837305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Higham2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles |last=Higham|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=H1c1UIEVH9gC|page=9}}|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0996-1|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sigfried J. de Laet, Ahmad Hasan Dani, eds. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BnY0KYbJC6wC&amp;pg=PA674 ''History of Humanity: From the third millennium to the seventh century B.C.''] UNESCO, 1996 {{ISBN|9231028111}} p.674&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tejas Garge (2010), [http://www.ancient-asia-journal.com/articles/10.5334/aa.10203/ Sothi-Siswal Ceramic Assemblage: A Reappraisal.] Ancient Asia. 2, pp.15–40. {{DOI|10.5334/aa.10203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kot Diji culture (3300–2600&amp;nbsp;BCE)==
The site covers 2.6 ha. The earliest occupation of this site is termed 'Kot Dijian', which is pre-Harappan, or early formative Harappan.&lt;ref&gt;Sigfried J. de Laet, Ahmad Hasan Dani, eds. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BnY0KYbJC6wC&amp;pg=PA674 ''History of Humanity: From the third millennium to the seventh century B.C.''] UNESCO, 1996 {{ISBN|9231028111}} p.674&lt;/ref&gt;

At the earliest layer, Kot Diji I (2605 BC), copper and bronze were not used.&lt;ref&gt;R.K. Pruthi, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=XgFu-9UF0TYC&amp;pg=PA22 ''Indus Civilization''.] Discovery Publishing House, 2004 {{ISBN|8171418651}} p22&lt;/ref&gt;  The houses and fortifications were made from unbaked mud-bricks. Lithic material, such as leaf-shaped chert arrowheads, shows parallels with [[Mundigak]] layers II-IV. The pottery seems to anticipate Harappan Ware.&lt;ref&gt;R.K. Pruthi, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=XgFu-9UF0TYC&amp;pg=PA22 ''Indus Civilization''.] Discovery Publishing House, 2004 {{ISBN|8171418651}} p22&lt;/ref&gt; Later, bronze was used, but only for personal ornaments. Also, use of the potters wheel was already in evidence.

The Early Harappan phase construction consists of two clearly defined areas.  There is a citadel on high ground for the elites separated by a defensive wall with bastions at regular intervals. This area measures about 500&amp;nbsp;ft x 350&amp;nbsp;ft.  The Outer area, or the city proper, consisted of houses of mud bricks on stone foundations. 

Pottery found from this site has designs with horizontal and wavy lines, or loops and simple triangular patterns.  Other objects found are pots, pans, storage jars, toy carts, balls, bangles, beads, terracotta figurines of mother goddess and animals, bronze arrowheads, and well-fashioned stone implements.  A particularly interesting find at Kot Diji is a toy cart, which shows that the potter’s wheel permitted the use of wheels for bullock carts.

===Progress towards Harappa Phase===
Glazed steatite beads were produced. There was a clear transition from the earlier [[Ravi pottery]] to what is commonly referred to as [[Kot Diji pottery]]. Red slip and black painted designs replaced polychrome decorations of the Ravi Phase. Then, there was a gradual transformation into what is commonly referred to as Harappa Phase pottery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harappa.com/indus4/e2.html Ravi and Kot Diji Phase Developments] harappa.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Indus script may have appeared at Kot Diji on pottery and on a sealing. The use of inscribed seals and the standardization of weights may have occurred during the Kot Diji period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harappa.com/indus4/e2.html Ravi and Kot Diji Phase Developments] harappa.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Late Kot-Diji type pots were found as far as [[Burzahom]] in [[Jammu and Kashmir]].

===Massive burning===
There are obvious signs of massive burning of over the entire site, including both the lower habitation area and the high mound (the fortified town), which were also observed at other Early Harappan sites: Period III at Gumla, Period II at Amri, Period ID at Naushero. Signs of cleavage were observed at Early Harappan phase Period I at Kalibangan. The cause of the disruptions and/or abandonment of these sites toward the end of the Early Harappan phase is still unexplained.&lt;ref&gt;Possehl, Gregory L. (2004). ''The Indus Civilization: A contemporary perspective'', New Delhi: Vistaar Publications, {{ISBN|81-7829-291-2}}, pp.47-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rani Kot (600-1843&amp;nbsp;AD)==
[[File:Kot diji.jpg|thumb|Fort of Rani Kot]]
According to legends, the wall existed during [[Umayyad]] rule and later under the [[Abbasid]] rule. The Soomro tribe inhabited the fort and later the [[Samma tribe]] positioned large infantry formations inside the fort.

The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Emir]]s armed the walls of the fort with cannons and muskets. They were the first to renovate the entire structure. The [[Kalhora]] tribe later gained control of the fort, and finally the [[Talpur]]s saw the fort as a strategic asset especially during the reign of [[Mir Fatih Ali Khan Talpur]], until they were defeated and overthrown by the British Empire, in 1843&amp;nbsp;AD.

'''Kuno Meyer''' (20 December 1858 – 11 October 1919) was a German scholar, distinguished in the field of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] philology and literature. His pro-German stance at the start of [[World War I]] in the United States was a source of controversy. His brother was the distinguished classical scholar, [[Eduard Meyer]].

Meyer was considered first and foremost a lexicographer among Celtic scholars but is known by the general public in Ireland rather as the man who introduced them to ''Selections from Ancient Irish Poetry'' (1911).&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;{{sfnp|Best|1923|p=182}}

He founded and edited four journals devoted to Celtic Studies,{{sfnp|Best|1923|p=182}} published numerous texts and translations of Old and Middle Irish romances and sagas, and wrote prolifically, his topics ranging to name origins and ancient law.&lt;ref name=titley/&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Hamburg]], he studied there at the [[Gelehrtenschule of the Johanneum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Meyer, Kuno |year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent two years in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], as a teenager (1874–1876) learning [[English language|English]].{{sfnp|Ó Lúing|1991|p=1}}&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;

From 1879, he attended the [[University of Leipzig]], where he was taught Celtic scholarship by [[Ernst Windisch]]. He received his doctorate for his thesis ''Eine irische Version der Alexandersage'', an Irish version of the [[Alexander Romance]], in 1884.&lt;ref name=meyer-thesis/&gt;

==Lecturer==
He then took up the post of lecturer in [[Teutonic languages]] at the new University College, [[Liverpool]], the precursor of the [[University of Liverpool]], which was established three years earlier.&lt;ref name=collier&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Meyer, Kuno|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to publish on [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] and more general topics on the [[Celtic languages]] , as well as producing textbooks for [[German language|German]]. In 1896,  he founded and edited jointly with {{illm|Ludwig Stern{{!}}Ludwig Christian Stern|de|Ludwig Stern}}, the prestigious ''[[Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie]]''. He also cofounded ''Archiv für celtische Lexicographie'' in 1898 with [[Whitley Stokes]], producing 3 volumes from 1900 to 1907.{{sfnp|Ó Lúing|1991|pp=21, 249}}

In 1903, Meyer founded the [[School of Irish Learning]] in Dublin, and the next year created its journal ''[[Ériu (journal)|Ériu]]'' of which he was the editor. Also in 1904, he became Todd Professor in the Celtic Languages at the [[Royal Irish Academy]]. In October 1911, he followed [[Heinrich Zimmer (Celticist)|Heinrich Zimmer]] as Professor of Celtic Philology at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin; the following year, a volume of ''Miscellany'' was presented to him by pupils and friends in honour of his election, and he was made a freeman of both [[Dublin]] and [[Cork (city)|Cork]].{{sfnp|Ó Lúing|1991|pp=172–3}}

==First World War==
At the outbreak of the [[First World War]], Meyer left Europe for the United States of America, where he lectured at [[Columbia University]], [[University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], and elsewhere.{{efn|{{Harvnb|Ó Lúing|1991|p=169}}: "{{illm|Gertrude Schoepperle|de|Gertrude Schoepperle}} had arranged for a long stay at Urbana University in Illinois".}}{{sfnp|Ó Lúing|1991|pp=168–9}} A pro-German speech he gave in December 1914 to [[Clan na Gael]] on [[Long Island]] caused outrage in Britain and some factions among the Irish,&lt;!--Ó Lúing (1991) pp.170–3--&gt; and as a result, he was removed from the roll of freemen in Dublin and Cork and from his Honorary Professorship of Celtic at Liverpool. He also resigned as Director of the School of Irish Learning and editor of ''Ériu''.{{sfnp|Ó Lúing|1991|pp=170–3, 178–9}}

[[Harvard University]] also had extended an invitation to Meyer to lecture on campus, but it subsequently "disinvited" him on in the fall of 1914 on account of Meyer's propagandist activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Harvard Alumni Bulletin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyTPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA544 |title=A War Poem and Its Consequences |pages=235–6|volume=17|number=30|date=5 May 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bethell |first=John T. |title=Harvard Observed: An Illustrated History of the University in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hxpvsfxjfMAC&amp;pg=PA70 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meyer nevertheless accepted candidacy for the post of exchange professor at Harvard, at the recommendation of German professors there. However, when the April 1915 issue of ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'' awarded first prize to an anti-German satirical poem "Gott mit Uns" written by an undergraduate, Meyer sent the university (and the press) a letter of protest, rebuking the faculty members who served as judges for failure to exercise neutrality. Meyer also declined his candidacy from the exchange professorship in the letter. In a reply, President [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]] said, in explaining Harvard's policy, that freedom of speech includes pro-German and pro-Allied voices alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1922|wstitle=Lowell, Abbott Lawrence|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Harvard graduates' magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uj4BAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA235|title=The Meyer incident|pages=235–6|volume=24|number=93|date=September 1915|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collier/&gt;

==Later life==
He was injured in a railway collision in 1915 and met 27-year-old Florence Lewis while he was recovering in a California hospital. They married shortly afterwards.{{sfnp|Ó Lúing|1991|pp=195, 212}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucc.ie/celt/meyer.html&lt;/ref&gt; Florence went to Germany in 1916, Meyer in 1917. In 1919 Florence and her daughter went to Switzerland. He died in [[Leipzig]].

==Legacy==
Posthumously, in 1920, Meyer's name was restored, both by Dublin and Cork, in their Rolls of Honorary Freemen. The restoration happened on 19 April 1920 in Dublin, where [[Sinn Féin]] had won control of the City Council three months before, rescinding the decision taken in 1915 by the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dublincity.ie/main-menu-services-press-and-news-read-press-release-press-releases-2013-press-releases-november-0 Freedom of the City of Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Gaelic League and the ''Irish Press'' petitioned the restoration as they were unaware that it had already occurred.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;

Meyer was regranted the Freedom of the City of Cork, as follows: "Re-elected 14th May, 1920, and order of Council of the 8th January, 1915, expunging his name from the roll rescinded."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corkcity.ie/yourcouncil/freedomofthecity/ Your Council »  Freedom of the City]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1920, Meyer was described by his acquaintance [[Douglas Hyde]], Celtic philologist and later president of the Republic of Ireland, as "one of the most lovable men who ever existed, and himself undoubtedly in love with Ireland". Hyde credited him with advancing the goals of the [[Gaelic League]] when the question arose whether to allow the teaching of the Irish language in the Intermediate Education of Ireland.
&lt;ref name="hyde"&gt;{{citation|last=Hyde |first=Douglas  |author-link=Douglas Hyde |title=Canon Peter O'Leary and Dr. Kuno Meyer |journal=Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review  |volume=9 |number=34 |date=June 1920 |pages=297–301 |jstor=30082987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. T. Cosgrave]], later president of the [[Irish Free State]], as a Dublin councilman, had strenuously opposed removal of Meyer's name from Dublin's Freemen roll in the first place. Cosgrave wrote in a letter that Meyer was recognized as "the greatest Celtic authority since the death of [[Whitley Stokes]]" and that he has "done more for Irish scholarship and Irish national glory than any other living man".&lt;ref name="cosgrave"&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Cosgrave |first=W.

In 2004, on the centenary of the publication of ''Ériu'', Proinsias Mac Cana described Kuno Meyer as "great" scholar, in "brilliant" partnership with [[John Strachan (linguist)|John Strachan]] as the first editors of ''Ériu'', his predecessors in that position. Meyer is among those credited with playing a crucial role in fostering native Irish Celtists in the initial phases of ''Ériu'' and the School of Irish Learning, and when the editorship over ''Ériu'' later passed to the succeeding generation of Irish scholars, tantamount to the fulfillment of the "primary intention of Meyer and his associates".{{r|"mac cana"}}

{{Wittgenstein|Later}}
A '''language-game''' ({{lang-de|Sprachspiel}}) is a philosophical concept developed by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], referring to simple examples of language use and the actions into which the language is woven.

== Description ==
In his work, ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] regularly referred to the concept of language-games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#Lan | title=Ludwig Wittgenstein | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | orig-year=2002 |year=2009 | accessdate=April 4, 2012 | author=Biletzki, Anat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein rejected the idea that language is somehow separate and corresponding to reality, and he argued that concepts do not need clarity for meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Jago 2007, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein used the term "language-game" to designate forms of language simpler than the entirety of a language itself, "consisting of language and the actions into which it is woven" ([[Philosophical Investigations|PI]] 7) and connected by [[family resemblance]] (''Familienähnlichkeit''). The concept was intended "to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or a form of life," (PI 23) which gives language its meaning.

The term 'language-game' is used to refer to:
* Fictional examples of language use that are simpler than our own everyday language. (e.g. PI 2)
* Simple uses of language with which children are first taught language (training in language).
* Specific regions of our language with their own grammars and relations to other language-games.
* All of a [[natural language]] seen as comprising a family of language-games.

These meanings are not separated from each other by sharp boundaries, but blend into one another (as suggested by the idea of family resemblance). The concept is based on the following analogy: The [[rules of language]] are analogous to the rules of games; thus saying something in a language is analogous to making a move in a game. The analogy between a language and a game demonstrates that words have meaning depending on the uses made of them in the various and multiform activities of human life. (The concept is not meant to suggest that there is anything trivial about language, or that language is "just a game".)

== Examples ==
The classic example of a language-game is the so-called "builder's language" introduced in §2 of the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'':
{{cquote|
The language is meant to serve for communication between a builder A and an assistant B. A is building with building-stones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the words "block", "pillar" "slab", "beam". A calls them out; — B brings the stone which he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call. Conceive this as a complete primitive language. (PI 2.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Foord |url=http://www.voidspace.org.uk/psychology/wittgenstein/one.shtml |title=Wittgenstein Philosophical Investigations - Aphorisms 1-10 |publisher=Voidspace.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Later "this" and "there" are added (with functions analogous to the function these words have in natural language), and "a, b, c, d" as numerals. An example of its use: builder A says "d — slab — there" and points, and builder B counts four slabs, "a, b, c, d..." and moves them to the place pointed to by A. The builder's language is an activity into which is woven something we would recognize as language, but in a simpler form. This language-game resembles the simple forms of language taught to children, and Wittgenstein asks that we conceive of it as "a complete primitive language" for a tribe of builders.

== Postmodernist interpretation ==
[[Jean-François Lyotard]] explicitly drew upon Wittgenstein's concept of language-games in developing his own notion of [[metanarratives]] in ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]''. However, Wittgenstein's concept is, from its inception, of a plurality of language games—their plurality is not a feature solely of contemporary discourse. Because Lyotard's discussion is primarily applied in the contexts of authority, power, and legitimation, where Wittgenstein's is broad, and concerned to mark distinctions between a wide range of activities in which language users engage. We can deduce that Lyotard uses the "language-gaminess", which Wittgenstein points out, to direct his own analysis and attention to the ways in which certain language-games, when in service to ideals, tend to form ideas about the world in their navigation in addition to the larger language-gameplay, whereby certain smaller language-games are more likely to play out in conglomerations that reinforce and comment upon the "opinion" side of relationships that are between propositions about the world while also at the risk of denying important, contrary, or non-similar "judgments" if they clash with typical gameplay. In this way, Lyotard implies that algorithms of viable strategies of gameplay, while certainly extant, are seldom used consistently—eventually leading to societal disruption and the realignment of basic language-games with common actions and thoughts.

'''''Latinos Beyond Reel''''' is a documentary which was released on February 23, 2013. Latinos Beyond Reel taps into the harsh reality of Latino representation in the media industry.  Latinos Beyond Reel was directed by Miguel Picker and Chyng-Feng Sun. ''Latinos Beyond Reel'' is under The Media Education Foundation (MEF). The Media Education Foundation (MEF) produced and distributed the film. The film talks about the underrepresentation and [[marginalization]] of Latinos in the U.S media. The film also talks about the effects the false representation of Latinos in the media industry has on youth. Latinos Beyond Reel captures the most unfortunate portrayal of Latinos in the media ranging from off-screen roles to animated characters in film and television.

During the film, the audience dives deep into the minds of children, who view every day, the poor representation of Latinos in the media. The children in the film claim that they have never seen a Hispanic superhero in the media and that all of the protagonists are white. One boy in the film refers to all of the protagonists portrayed in the media as "American".&lt;ref&gt;http://silk.library.umass.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f3h&amp;AN=90087684&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site
Hall, P. "Latinos Beyond Reel." Video Librarian 28.5 (2013): 71-72. Film &amp; Television Literature Index with Full Text. Web. 11 Nov. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; The boy calling all of the protagonists American shows the detachment that Latinos, and many other races or demographics, feel from the society and culture in America.

== Summary ==

The film digs deep into a look at media in America’s society from the perspective of Latinos. The film talks about how the Latino actors and actress' have only marginalized roles in the media such as maids, over-sexualized women, and thieves. Latinos Beyond Reel discusses how Latino men are always cast as the antagonists in films and television shows, and women often play the role of a maid. One actress Lube Ontiveros, who was discussed in the film, has been quoted in previous articles saying she has played the role of a maid more than 150 times.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/28/arts/television/lupe-ontiveros-69-desperate-housewives-actress-dies.html?_r=0
Navarro, Mireya. "Lupe Ontiveros, Who Portrayed Maids and Moms, Dies at 69." The New York Times. The New York Times, 27 July 2012. Web. 11 Nov. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; Lube Ontivernos' experience as playing a maid more than 150 times puts the Latino underrepresentation into perspective.

At one point in the film, actor [[Yancey Arias]] talks about how what is written specifically in the script will stay in the film no matter how much an actor wants to stray away from the script. When [[Yancey Arias]] talks about how what is in the script will be on the screen, he is talking about himself going away from the stereotypes the writers and directors portray of him. [[Yancey Arias]] talks about how he tries to change his acting for a role so he, as a Latino, doesn't seem like as much of an antagonist as he is made out to be. Still, all of the things [[Yancey Arias]] would do to try and stay away from Latino stereotypes would not be added into the film because someone behind the scenes would want to keep the Latino portrayal as a negatively portrayed character.

The documentary also explores some of the recent positive shows and the impacts they are having on society. Some prime examples of sitcoms that portray Latinos in a positive light are [[Dora the Explorer]], [[George Lopez]], and [[Ugly Betty]]. It is also said that some actress still plays the overhyped Latino stereotypical role. Sofia Vergara of Modern Family is one of the most well-known Hispanic actors of all time and still, plays that Latino stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;http://nbclatino.com/author/kristinapuga/.
"Latinos Beyond Reel: Film Hopes to Change Latino Stereotypes In media." NBC Latino. N.p., 13 Mar. 2013. Web. 11 Nov. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; Since so many people view Sofia Vergara as a staple of Latino culture when she plays the stereotypes, people believe they are true. The documentary gets at the fact that Latino roles are marginalized on and off camera.

Latinos Beyond Reel uses key statistics to explain why Latinos should be more of a target market in consumerism. Latinos make up a large portion of the population yet, makes up a small portion of the advertising market. The explanation of how much Latinos consume and spend is also discussed in this documentary.

'''Menominee''' {{IPAc-en|m|ᵻ|ˈ|n|ɒ|m|ᵻ|n|iː}}&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Menominee}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also spelled '''Menomini''') is an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] [[language]] spoken by the historic [[Menominee]] people of what is now northern Wisconsin in the United States. The federally recognized tribe has been working to encourage revival of use of the language by intensive classes locally and partnerships with universities. Most of the fluent speakers are elderly. Many of the people use English as their first language.

The name of the tribe, and the language, ''Oma͞eqnomenew'', comes from the word for [[wild rice]]. The tribe has gathered and cultivated this native food as a staple for millennia. The [[Anishinaabe]] ([[Ojibwa]]), their neighbors to the north who also speak an Algonquian language, also use this term for them.

The main characteristics of Menominee, as compared to other Algonquian languages, are its extensive use of the low [[front vowel]] {{IPA|/æ/}}, its rich negation [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and its [[lexicon]]. Some scholars (notably [[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfield]] and [[Edward Sapir|Sapir]]) have classified it as a Central Algonquian language based on its [[phonology]].

For good sources of information on both the Menominee and their language, some valuable resources include [[Leonard Bloomfield]]'s 1928 bilingual text collection, his 1962 grammar (a landmark in its own right), and Skinner's earlier anthropological work.

== Usage and revitalization efforts ==
Menominee is a highly [[endangered language]], with only a handful of fluent speakers left. According to a 1997 report by the Menominee Historic Preservation Office, 39 people spoke Menominee as their [[first language]], all of whom were elderly; 26 spoke it as their [[second language]]; and 65 others had learned some of it for the purpose of understanding the language and/or teaching it to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|}

===Vowels===
*Long {{IPA|/æː/}} or {{IPA|/ɛː/}} is labialized if the preceding syllable contains a back vowel or when it is followed by a palatalized consonant.  The same is true for {{IPA|/eː/}}
*Short {{IPA|/æ/}} {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is particularly open when found before ''h'' and ''q''.
*{{IPA|/o/}} is consistently lengthened before {{IPA|/w/}}.
*{{IPA|/ia/}} and {{IPA|/ua/}} are treated like long vowels in the assignment of stress.  They contrast with {{IPA|/ja/}} and {{IPA|/wa/}}.  For example, ''uah'' ('he uses it') is distinct from ''wa:h'' ('fish egg').  Final {{IPA|/w/}} after {{IPA|/i/}} becomes primarily bilabial.  The syllable {{IPA|/wa/}} can alternate with {{IPA|/o/}} for some speakers.

Vowels are slightly nasalized before or after {{IPA|/m/}} or {{IPA|/n/}}.

===Consonants===

*{{IPA|/t/}} is postdental
*The unvoiced sibilant {{IPA|/s/}} can range between {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[ʃ]}}
*{{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/ʔ/}} do not appear initially, except sometimes as the on-glide of a vowel, in which case they should probably not be considered phonemic.  Final {{IPA|/h/}} after {{IPA|/i/}} is sometimes dropped and sometimes replaced with {{IPA|/j/}}, as in ''pih'', ('paddle').

Consonants, including nasals, are palatalized before front vowels and labialized before back vowels.

Menominee does not make contrasts between voiced and voiceless stops and voicing from a following vowel may set in before the opening is complete.

===Syllable structure and stress===

Syllable structure in Menominee is typically VC(C) or C(C)VC(C); syllables do not end in vowels.  Any consonant can begin or end a syllable except ''h'' and ''q''.  The only clusters which can occur at the end of a syllable are ''qc'' and ''qs''.  The only cluster which can begin a syllable is ''kw''.

Primary stress occurs on every long vowel or diphthong that is in the next-to-last syllable of a word.  Most compounds and inflected forms are treated as single words in assigning stress.  Rhetorical stress comes on the last syllable.

===Pitch===

In an interrogative sentence which uses a question word, there is a rising and then falling of pitch near the beginning and a drop at the end.  In [[yes-no question]]s, there is a sharp rise in pitch at the end of the sentence.  The modulations of pitch for expressing exclamations, quotations, etc. is generally much more pronounced in Menominee than in English.

==Grammar - general==
===Lexical Categories===
Bloomfield states there are five overarching categories in Menominee: noun, pronoun, negator, verb, and particle. Nouns, pronouns, negators, and verbs all take inflection whereas particles do not carry any morphology. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Menomini Language|last=Bloomfield|first=Leonard|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agreement ===
Agreement morphology in Menominee can be polysemous, i.e. animacy and number (nouns), are indicated within the same affix.

====Animacy====
All nouns are split into two categories and are inflected for animacy and are classified as either animate or inanimate. Animacy in Menominee is a grammatical construct for noun classification and not a reflection of the noun's status as "living" or "non-living." Therefore, some semantically inherently inanimate objects are grammatically animate. 

==== Number ====
All nouns are required to be inflected if they are plural. Nouns which are singular are unmarked. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Person marking ====
Menominee has four grammatical persons: first, second, third, and indefinite.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Menomini Language|last=Bloomfield|first=Leonard|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1962|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar - nouns ==

=== Agreement morphology ===
Noun classes are split based on [[grammatical gender]] into two categories: animate and inanimate. Additionally, all nouns must be marked for plurality. Plurality agreement are suffixes that attach to noun stems. Singular forms are unmarked (represented by zero morpheme "ø") and plural has two forms, as shown in the table below. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These suffixes are attached directly to noun stems or to possessed themes. Examples below show singular and plural inflections of both animate and inanimate nouns: &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{|

|}There are four personal prefixes used to modify nouns and in personal pronouns:

*1st person: nɛ-
*2nd person: kɛ- (also used for inclusive 1st person plural)
*3rd person: o-
*indefinite: mɛ-

Certain nouns occur only in possessed forms, typically referring to body parts or relatives, such as ''okiːqsemaw'', "son"; ''kese:t'', "your (s.) foot"; ''mese:t'', "someone's foot".  These affixes are used to indicate possession (e.g. ''neme:h'' "my older sister"; ''neta:qsɛnem'', "my stone").  They are also used in the inflection of verbs to indicate the actor.

The personal pronouns formed by these prefixes are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!
!Singular
!Plural
|-
|'''1st'''
|''nenah- I''
|''nenaq (exclusive)- We''

''kenaq'' (inclusive)- We
|-
|'''2nd'''
|''kenah- You''
|''kenuaq- You (plural)''
|-
|'''3rd'''
|''wenah- He/She/It''
|''wenuaq- They''
|}

Nouns and nearly all pronouns are inflected for singular and plural.  Some nouns occur only as singulars, typically denoting liquids or other uncountable substances (e.g. ''kahpeːh'', coffee).  The singular is often used for a representative meaning, e.g. ''ɛːsespemaːteset omɛːqnomeneːw'', "the way the Menomini lives".

Nouns can also be inflected for locality:

''weːkewam'', "house"

''weːkewameh'', "in a house"

''yoːm'', "this"

''yoːs'', "right here"

Diminutives can be formed from any noun by suffixing -æshs

Agent nouns (i.e., nouns that mean one who does the action of the verb, such as "worker" from "work", "talker" from "talk", in English) are homonymous with the third person inflected verb.  So,

''anohkiːw'', "he works" or "worker"

''moːhkotaːqsow'', "he whittles" or "carpenter"

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

== Grammar - verbs ==

Menominee displays inflectional reference.  Nouns, verbs, and objects are inflected to agree in gender, person, and number of their possessor, actor, or transitive verb, respectively.

Intransitive verbs typically occur in two forms: one for animate actors, the other for inanimate actors:
''paːpɛhcen'', "he falls"
''paːpɛhnɛn'', "it falls"

Transitive verbs can be used with either animate or inanimate actors.  Transitive verbs contain inflectional reference both to their subject and to the object.  One form of the verb exists for animate objects and another for inanimate objects:
''koqnɛw'', "he fears him"
''koqtam'', "he fears it"

Impersonal verbs occur with no identifiable actor and in the singular inflection:
''kɛqsiw'', "it is cold"
''kemeːwan'', "it is raining"

The negator ''kan'' typically precedes the verb: ''kan kemeːwanon'', "it is not raining".  The negator also inflects for certain elements of modal inflection: ''kasaq kemeːwanon'', "why, it isn't raining anymore!"  It can be used alone to answer a yes-no question.  The particle ''poːn'' is used to negate imperatives: ''poːn kasɛːhkehseh'', "don't be too late".

Bloomfield distinguishes five modes of the verb in Menominee, which are reflected in the verb, negator, personal and demonstrative pronouns, and auxiliary verbs:

*Indicative: ''piːw'', "he comes"
The indicative makes statements.  In the first-person plural, it is used as a hortatory (first person plural imperative: ''kenawmaːciaq'', "let's set out"

*Quotative: ''piːwen'', "it is said that he comes"
**The quotative typically ends in -en, is used when the speaker is stating something learned from another person or from a dream or vision.  It is the mode used in traditional narrative.
*Interrogative: ''piːq'', "is he coming?"
**The interrogative is used for yes-no questions.
*Present: ''piasah', "so he is coming"
**The present mode, typically ending in -esa or -sa, puts an emphasis on the fact that the event is taking place in the present, as opposed to the past or in contrast with expectation.
*Preterit: ''piapah'', "he did formerly come"
**The preterit, typically ending in -epa or -pa, puts an emphasis on the fact that the event took place in the past, as opposed to in the present or in contrast with expectation.

==Language family==

Menominee is an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]], part of the larger family of [[Algic languages]].  Goddard (1996) and Mithun (1999) classify it with the [[Central Algonquian languages|Central]] and [[Plains Algonquian languages]], along with languages like [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]], [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]], [[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]], [[Cree language|Cree-Montagnais]], and Eastern Great Lakes languages like Ojibwe.

In his more controversial classification of American Indian languages, [[Joseph Greenberg]] places the [[Algic languages|Algic]] family within a family which he calls [[Almosan]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Joseph.  An Amerind Etymological Dictionary.  Stanford University, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The classification was first proposed by [[Edward Sapir]] in 1929.  It groups [[Algic]] with other language families including [[Kutenai language|Kutenai]], otherwise thought to be an [[language isolate|isolate]], and [[Mosan languages|Mosan]], which includes [[Wakashan]], [[Chimakuan]], and [[Salishan]].  The Mosan family proposal is currently considered to be unfounded.

DeLong-Bas''' is an [[United States|American]] scholar and the author of a number of books on Islam, as well as "numerous book chapters and encyclopedia articles" on the subject of "[[Saudi Arabia]], [[Wahhabism]], [[Islam]]ic thought and history, Islam and politics, and contemporary [[jihadism]]".&lt;ref name=OISOL&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Islamic Studies online.

DeLong-Bas (includes photo of DeLong-Bas)|url=http://www.mei.edu/profile/natana-j-delong-bas|publisher=Middle East Institute|accessdate=Oct 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
DeLong-Bas is assistant professor at the [[Boston College]] theology department.&lt;ref name=bc&gt;{{cite web|title=Natana J. DeLong-Bas, Theology Department|url=http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/ics/faculty-ics/natana-delong-bas.html|publisher=Boston College|accessdate=Oct 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also serves in a number of editorial, advisory and consulting roles.&lt;ref name=OISOL/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc/&gt; Previously DeLong-Bas has taught at [[Brandeis University]] and worked as a consultant for the [[RAND Corporation]].&lt;ref name=bc/&gt;

==Views==
DeLong-Bas has expressed the view that there is too much negativity towards Wahhabism in the West, and in her writings has argued that [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] was "not the godfather of contemporary terrorist movements", but 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"a voice of reform, reflecting mainstream eighteenth-century Islamic thought. His vision of Islamic society was based upon monotheism in which Muslims, Christians, and Jews were to enjoy peaceful co-existence and cooperative commercial treaty relations."&lt;ref name=OUP&gt;{{cite web|title=Wahhabi Islam|url=http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9780195169911.html|website=Oxford University Press|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IDOM&gt;{{cite web|title=American Professor Natana DeLong-Bas: ‘I Do Not Find Any Evidence...'|url=http://www.islamdaily.org/en/wahabism/5201.american-professor-natana-delong-bas-%E2%80%98i-do-not-fin.htm|website=Islam Daily Observing Media|publisher=03 Jan 2007|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

DeLong-Bas believes that extremism in Saudi Arabia "does not stem from" Islam, but from issues such as oppression of the Palestinian people, "Iraq, and the American government's tying [the hands of] the U.N. [and preventing it] from adopting any resolution against Israel, have definitely added to the Muslim youth's state of frustration."&lt;ref name=IDOM/&gt;

In an December 21, 2006 interview in the [[London]] daily ''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]'', DeLong-Bas was quoted&lt;ref name="thejustice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejustice.org/news/view.php/204717/Culture-and-Controversy|title=Culture and Controversy|last=Herman|first=Bernard|date=January 23, 2007|publisher=TheJustice.org|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as stating that she did "...not find any evidence that would make me agree that [[Osama bin Laden]] was behind the [[September 11 attacks|Attack on the Twin Towers]]".&lt;ref name=IDOM/&gt; A month later in ''The Justice''—the student newspaper of Brandeis University (where she was teaching at the time) -- she disputed the quote, stating: "Of course he did. He's the CEO of Al-Qaeda and the leader of their political agenda. All I claimed was that he didn't have anything to do with the logistics or the planning of the attacks themselves."&lt;ref name="thejustice" /&gt;

==''Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad''==

DeLong-Bas's book ''[[Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad]]'' was published in 2004 by [[Oxford University Press]]. It is based "on a close study of the 14 volumes" of collected works&lt;ref name=ybarra/&gt; of [[Wahhabism]]'s founder, [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] and has been called "the first extensive explication of the theology" of Wahhabism.&lt;ref name=ybarra&gt;{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB109027620568967848  |title=Books. In the Prophet's Name  [Review] |first=Michael J. |last=Ybarra|publisher=wsj.com|date=July 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into sections: a brief religious biography and history of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, theology, Islamic law, women and Wahhabism, jihad and the evolution of Wahhabism.&lt;ref name=B&amp;N&gt;{{cite web|title=Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad.

===Critical reception===
''Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad'' has been praised as a "monumental work ... lucid and carefully documented",&lt;ref name=Long&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=David E|title=Saudi Arabia [review of ''Wahhabi Islam'' by Natana DeLong-Bas]|journal=Middle East Journal|date=2005|pages=316–19|jstor=4330135}}&lt;/ref&gt; "often fascinating", and presenting "a nuanced discussion of Wahhab's Quranic interpretation",&lt;ref name=ybarra/&gt; but also criticized as a "piece of scholarly trash"&lt;ref name=Kearney/&gt; and of "markedly inferior quality",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Schwartz |first=Stephen|title=[Review of] Wahhabi Islam: From Revival to Global Jihad by Natana J.

It has received positive reviews&lt;ref name=OUP2&gt;{{cite web|title=Wahhabi Islam From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad. Reviews and Awards|url=http://global.oup.com/academic/product/wahhabi-islam-9780195333015?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#|website=Oxford University Press USA|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; from David E. Long in ''[[Middle East Journal]]'' (a "monumental work ... a lucid and carefully documented assessment of Wahhabism."&lt;ref name=Long/&gt;),  Sara Powell in ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]'' ("...a well-regarded, logically constructed, and considered --if perhaps somewhat sympathetic--analysis of Abd al-Wahhab's beliefs"&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=Sara|title=Books [Review] Wahhabi Islam|journal=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date=May–June 2005|url=http://www.wrmea.org/wrmea-archives/274-washington-report-archives-2000-2005/may-june-2005/8513-book-and-video-reviews-wahabi-islam-a-women-in-struggle.html|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), ''History'' magazine ("a ground-breaking study ... both controversial and informative").&lt;ref name=OUP2/&gt;

But others have questioned the book and DeLong-Bas's views on Wahhabism. Author [[Stephen Suleyman Schwartz]] has called her an "apologist", criticizing her for among other things, receiving financial support from Saudi Arabia; not including as a source the correspondence of ibn Abd al-Wahhab, "which critics of Wahhabism and other Saudis consider key to understanding him"; and failing to mention the religious and/or governmental background of some Saudi Arabians mentioned in her acknowledgments.&lt;ref name=Schwartz-thank&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Stephen|title=Natana DeLong-Bas: American Professor, Wahhabi Apologist|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/01/natana_delongbas_american_prof.html|website=Real Clear Politics|accessdate=9 June 2014|ref=January 19, 2007|quote=Her book seemed to have been rushed into print with official Saudi support: DeLong-Bas thanked such individuals as Faisal bin Salman, whose status as a Saudi prince she failed to mention; Abd Allah S. al-Uthaymin, son of a notoriously extreme member of the Wahhabi clerical class in the kingdom; and Fahd as-Semmari, director of the King Abd al-Aziz Foundation for Research and Archives in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. She also acknowledged the latter foundation for financial support.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Rl9eCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT257&amp;dq=Wahhabism+satan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Natana&amp;f=false|title=Force and Fanaticism: Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia and Beyond|last=Valentine|first=Simon Ross|date=2015-01-09|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781849046169|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist and author [[Michael J. Ybarra]], called the book "often fascinating", and providing "a nuanced discussion of Wahhab's Quranic interpretation", but also complained that she "seems to bend over backward to give Wahhab the benefit of the doubt while dismissing his critics as biased."&lt;ref name=ybarra/&gt; He also notes that DeLong-Bas "doesn't say ... where on earth" the tolerant form of Wahhabism described by her "ever existed",&lt;ref name=Kearney&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kearney|first1=John|title=The real Wahhab.|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2004/08/08/the_real_wahhab?pg=full|accessdate=13 August 2014|publisher=Boston.com|date=August 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the voice of Wahhab himself is largely absent from this book" because the author rarely quotes him.&lt;ref name=ybarra/&gt;

[[Khaled Abou El Fadl]], professor of law at University of California, Los Angeles who writes frequently on Islamic jurisprudence, expressed sorrow that Oxford University Press had published the book, stating "This doesn't qualify as scholarship -- it falls within the general phenomenon of Saudi apologetics."&lt;ref name=Kearney/&gt;

[[Michael Sells]], professor at the [[University of Chicago]] wrote that DeLong-Bas never challenges the propriety of Abd al-Wahhab’s claim to authority to distinguish believers from unbelievers and to impose the most severe sanctions on those he disagrees with.&lt;ref name=Kearney/&gt; Simon Ross Valentine suggested that the image of Wahhabism presented by Delong-Bas is a "rewriting of history that flies in the face of historical fact".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Rl9eCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT257&amp;dq=Wahhabism+satan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=Natana&amp;f=false|title=Force and Fanaticism: Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia and Beyond|last=Valentine|first=Simon Ross|date=2015-01-09|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781849046169|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}
== What ''type'' of thing is sculpture? ==
Sculpture can be described as all of the following:

* [[Art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity. The word "art" is therefore both a verb and a noun, as is the term "sculpture".
** [[Work of art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic physical item or artistic creation.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; as an art form, sculpture is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Sculpture is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse.
*** A branch of the [[visual arts]] &amp;ndash; visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, architecture and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.
** [[Fine art]] &amp;ndash; in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word "fine" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6325">A '''position paper''' is an essay that presents an arguable [[opinion]] about an issue – typically that of the author or some specified entity. Position papers are published in academia, in politics, in law and other domains. The goal of a position paper is to convince the audience that the opinion presented is valid and worth listening to. Ideas for position papers that one is considering need to be carefully examined when choosing a topic, developing an argument, and organizing the paper. 

Position papers range from the simplest format of a [[letter to the editor]], through to the most complex in the form of an academic position paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sanders|Tingloo|Verhulst|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-gBH7BQqy_0C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;vq=%22The+simplest+form+is+the+letter+to+the+editor%22&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U3rDMBciOi4ZB2l3gHAbnCLMSb0Kg 11]}}, "The simplest form is the letter to the editor... The most complex type of position paper is the academic position paper in which arguments and evidence are presented to support the writer's views."&lt;/ref&gt; Position papers are also used by large organizations to make public the official beliefs and recommendations of the group.&lt;ref&gt;An example of a position paper published by an organization: {{Citation

== In academia ==
Position papers in academia enable discussion on emerging topics without the experimentation and original research normally present in an [[academic paper]]. Commonly, such a document will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.

== In politics ==
Position papers are most useful in contexts where detailed comprehension of another entity's views is important; as such, they are commonly used by political campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steely|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZUNJPsV9i0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22The+Gentleman+from+Georgia:%22+%22The+Biography+of+Newt+Gingrich%22&amp;ei=-9mxSKLpCIPctAOFkdHaBA&amp;sig=ACfU3U30RgMIjhbEY1SMSUxGE9c2nfihkQ#PRA1-PA186,M1 186]}}, "Through the use of position papers, telephone briefings, audio and video tapes and personal appearances Newt was able to share his ideas, ... ."&lt;/ref&gt; government organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In government, a position paper lies on somewhere between a [[white paper]] and a [[green paper]] in that they affirm definite opinions and propose solutions but may not go so far as detailing specific plans for implementation.

== In law ==
In [[international law]], the term for a position paper is [[Aide-mémoire]]. An Aide-Mémoire is memorandum setting forth the minor points of a proposed discussion or disagreement, used especially in undiplomatic communications.

'''''The Birth of Biopolitics''''' is a part of [[Foucault's lectures at the Collège de France|a lecture series]] by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] at the [[Collège de France]] between 1978 and 1979 and published posthumously based on audio recordings. In it, Foucault develops further the notion of [[biopolitics]] introduced in a previous lecture series, ''Security, Territory, Population'', by tracing the ways in which the eighteenth-century political economy marked the birth of a new governmental [[rationality]]. Foucault uses the term [[Governmentality]] and raising questions of [[Political science]], [[political philosophy]] and [[social policy]] concerning the role and status of the [[State (polity)|State]] and [[neo-liberalism]] in twentieth century politics.

== New rationality ==

For Foucault, [[biopolitics]] is political power exercised on whole populations in every aspect of human life.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 363 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault discusses the basic definition of the practices of the neoliberal art of government. Foucault then tries to redefine the boundaries set by liberal thought on this matter. Foucault concentrates on the monetary aspect of government as a point of concern, frugal government, the art of maximum and a minimum and between the total opposite minimum and maximum.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 27-29 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault looks at the early institutional practices of this method of frugal government, which starts from the early Middle Ages down to the early 16th and 17th centuries. The market appears from the early Middle Ages where the function of interest on money lending was strictly prohibited; one of the reasons being that the church was the main institution lending money at interest on church property where rental income was charged on church property a primary source of income for the church and it would have brought down the price of the church rental income if faced with rival competitors. Justification, according to Foucault, for the market was justice which was why the market existed in the first place. But, what was meant by justice? Foucault offers this explanation; it was a site of justice in the sense that the sale price fixed in the market was seen, both by theorist and in practice, as a just price, or at any rate a price that should be the just price, which meant to the theorists of the day a price that was to have a certain relationship with work performed, with the needs of the merchants, and of course, with the consumers needs and possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 27-53 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The next general theme Foucault introduces is the German [[Ordoliberalism]], the [[Freiburg School]] which produced general problems among themselves, namely the state apparatus and its reconstruction after the Second World War. This general theme led to neo-liberalism heavy reliances on the law obviously, but it too, had to produce a new kind of consensus and a rearrangement consensus between the general populace; the working population, those engaged in production. This general or collective consensus produced 'economic partners' in this so-called 'economic game',&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 51-73 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; such as; investors, employers, government officials, work force, and trade union officials. Foucault then offers some explanation on what was the reasoning behind this consensus between all these so-called different economic partners. According to Foucault this produced another kind of consensus, which was political power of the electoral community, not the political power of the right to vote, but the right of the political community to exchange seats, a rearrangement of the very relations of the so-called change of 'government' which gives and protects legitimacy. Which becomes political consensus, inasmuch as the 'economic partners 'accept the economic game of freedom. This is very much on neo-liberalism agenda, which according to Foucault was exactly the agenda that neo-liberalism required.

A strong Deutschmark, a satisfactory rate of economic growth, increased wages, an expanding purchasing power, and a favorable balance of payments which became a by product of the effects of good government. Foucault reads into this that in contemporary German which was in reality a founding consensus of the state. Foucault notices that this formation of a liberal type of governmentality had general shifts within this circle which can be traced back to the 18th century old or classical liberalism programmed by the [[Physiocrats]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], and the other economists, for whom the problem was the exact opposite. The problem that neo-liberalism had to resolve was the following: given the existence of a legitimate state, which is fully functional under the police state with all its administration form of police state, how can this be limited within the existing state and, above all, allow for the necessary economic freedom within it.

For Foucault, this was the exact opposite because after the [[Second World War]], the war machine that was unleashed was due to the fact that the system of economic rationality had broken down and the organisational network of world trade and its accompanied trade settlement system had completely become untenable, in which trust in the final payment settlement system had completely vanished, therefore initiating the military machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The network of world trade : a companion volume to "Europe's trade" |publisher=League of Nations |year=1942 |oclc=2835669 |pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The World Trade Network |first1=Luca |last1=De Benedicts |first2=Luca |last2=Tajoli |date=2010-09-15 |url=http://www.eief.it/files/2010/10/luca-de-benedictis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy of society ==
Another theme Foucault concentrates on is the neo-liberalism conception of social effects, ''[[Gesellschaftspolitik]]'', known in English, from the German, as the ''policy of society'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 129-157 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 101-128 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 159-184 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; this policy of society addresses the whole consensus of society. But this ''Gesellschaftspolitik'' had a two sided inconsistency, it had to produce the willing actors who take part in the economic process to accept the reality of their economic position and therefore their fate. The working population or labor force, the ones involved in production, madness, disease, medicine, delinquency, sexuality, but somehow, none of these faults/errors never existed before practices were involved and invented to become part of collective consciousness within practices. Foucault deals with this problem as necessary intrinsic operations of government which inextribably can produce ''regimes of truth'' (Foucault means regimes of truth as necessary social practices which become necessary objects of knowledge).

The ability to extrapolate a collective of co-ordinate errors becoming co-ordinated practices which become something that did not exist in the first place, but now becomes established systems of knowledge objects.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 1-25 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 27-51 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The political regimes of truth (political power upon every aspect of human social life), the battle between legitimacy, submitting to a fabricated division between true and false. Foucault begins to try to trace back through time how this was at all possible, Foucault manages this task by reading into the set of practices interwoven into the policy of society, this was accomplished from the 16th until the 18th century where there was a whole set of practices of tax levies, customs, charges, manufacture regulations, regulations of grain prices, the protection and codification of market practices, etc.

This was well conceived by the exercise of sovereign rights, feudal rights, as the maintenance of customs, as effective procedure of enrichment for the financial administration of the general sovereign or the tax authorities, or as techniques for preventing urban revolt due to the discontent of this or that group of subjects.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 129-150 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault takes a look at these general practices through looking at the economic practices involved from the 18th century (where [[Mercantilism]] was at its peak) where a coherence strategy established an intelligible mechanism which provided a coherent link, together these different practices and their effects, and consequently allows one to judge all these practices as good or bad, not in terms of a law or moral principle, but in terms of propositions subject to the false dichotomy between true and false. Governments, Foucault noticed, were compelled to enter this competitive environment, by doing so entering into new regimes of truth with the fundamental effect of reconfiguring all the questions formally beset by the art of government.

Foucault turns his attention to [[ordoliberalism]]'s view on social policy and how this can be woven into society's political power which differentates from [[Adam Smith]]'s liberalism two centuries earlier. This problem was faced head on by ordoliberalism; how can the overall exercise of political power be modeled on the principles of a market economy? To accomplish this the old version of classic liberalism had to be subjected to a whole series of modifications. The first set of transformations was the dissociation of the market economy from the political principle of [[laissez-faire]], this uncoupling of the market and laissez-faire was replaced with, not abandon by a theory of pure competition which produced a formal structure and formal properties which could lay the fundamental principle of the compective structure that assured economic regulation through the price mechanism. This is a break from traditional liberalism principles.Founded by traditional liberals such as [[Walter Lippmann]] and expressed by many other traditional liberals such as [[Jacques Rueff]], [[Wilhelm Röpke]], [[Alexander Rüstow]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Robert Marjolin]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and their intermediaries and a non-economist, but however, was highly influential, according to Foucault [[Raymond Aron]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth Of Biopolitics'' pp.133-157 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth Of Biopolitics'' p.152 see note 12 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

How would neo-liberalism define the new governmental action? Foucault traces three examples which neo-liberalism call a conformable economic action; firstly the question of monopolies which they claimed differed somewhat from classic liberalism. The classic conception of the economy as the monopoly seen as somehow semi-neutral, semi-necessary consequence of the competition in a [[capitalist]] system. The neo-liberal dream of competition cannot be left to develop without monopolistic phenomena appearing at the same time. This would eventually have the effect, of suppressing the operation of mechanism that facilitate, bring with them, and hopefully determine its eventual destiny. However, Foucault notices specific problems began to emerge for neo-liberalism, not only specific to neo-liberalism was how to incorporate civil society, political power; and [[Homo oeconomicus]] into a non-substitutable, irreducible atom of interest. Foucault makes the starting point of his investigations into this process from the 18th century where ''Homo oeconomicus'' has to be integrated into the system of which he is a part.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 215-237 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil society ==
The concept ''[[Homo economicus]]'' had specific problems being interwoven into the new-found economic process of the 18th century. Foucault manages to trace this anomaly through the subject of right (known as [[consent of the governed]] the theory of right of that legal theorists of the 18th century tried to establish during their legal discourse) which did receive a great deal of attention because of what was perceived at the time of problems regarding the sovereign's power. The subject of right had to perform slight modifications because of the implication of him (the subject of right) limiting the sovereign's power. Which certainly differed from classical liberalism's conception of the sovereign power, which from the 16th century was conceived of as impenetrable to any rational discourse. The sovereign was conceived of as absolute, but the discovery of the people, subject of rights, homo oeconomicus, changed all that because of the arrival of market practices (the market system of capitalism) from the 18th century. Even the Physiocrats insisted that the market, the sovereign had to really respect the market.

How could this new problematic of liberalism, the sovereign, the market, and the new-found political power, homo oeconomicus which economic activity had at least specific patterns of correlation could be moulded into one tight unit? Foucault seeks the answer to this with a new field of reference, [[civil society]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 290-316 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 267-289 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault answers this question on the process of how to govern through governmental technology, the new neo-liberals, economic liberals sought to have a heterogeneity of the economic and the judicial which must be pegged to an economy understood as process of production and exchange. [[Civil society]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 291-316 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; according to Foucault's analysis, must place particular attention to its correlation of technology of government, the rational measure of which must be judicially pegged to an economy understood as the process of production and exchange.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 267-290 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

What made this version of civil society tick? Foucault makes the amalgamation of civil society into society, which at the end of the 18th century became known as the nation (now known to us as the [[nation state]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 291-316 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; This became omnipresent, nothing was allowed to escape, which was to conform to the rules of right, and a government which nevertheless respects the specificity of the economy, will be a government that manages civil society, the nation, society, and the social. Foucault continues the theme on Homo oeconomicus which became part and parcel to this feature, ''Homo oeconomicus'' and civil society were two inseparable features and belonged to the same ensemble of the technology of liberal governmentality. For Foucault this was no mere coincidence, since the 19th century, civil society has always been referred to in [[political philosophy]] discourse as a fixed reality, which according to this theory, was outside of government or the state or state apparatuses or institutions. This omnipresent has many characteristics and one its main features are a primary and immediate reality which forms part of modern governmental technology.

Foucault views this governmental characteristic as simply the direct correlation of modern society's direct association with madness, disease, sexuality, criminal recidivism and criminal delinquency which he calls transactional realities. Although civil society, along with its associated governmental technologies haven't always existed they are nonetheless real, by real he simply means the power dynamic and their interplay with the rest of society in which all those involved, everything within it constantly eludes them. It is in Foucault's analysis where he makes four important points on this governmental modern technology of biopolitics; an absolute correlative to the form of governmental technology which liberalism associated itself with, and it is pegged, tied to the specificity of economic process.

How were all three incorporated into rational liberalism philosophical discourse? Foucault cites the well-known texts of [[Adam Ferguson]]: ''Essay on the History of Civil Society''; from the 18th century to show how liberalism approached this problem from different angles and [[Adam Smith]] and his ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' which complement one another with regards civil society. First: there is a political and social correlate in terms of civil society. Second, civil society as principle of spontaneous synthesis; third, civil society as permanent matrix of political power; and fourth, civil society as the motor element that drives human history.&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 267-290 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 291-316 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Cápsula do Tempo em Macau.JPG|350px|right|thumb|The Time Capsule for the transfer of sovereignty over Macau]]
'''Time Capsule''' ({{lang-pt|Cápsula do Tempo}}, {{zh|c=時間囊}}) is a [[time capsule]] that symbolizes the [[Government of Portugal|Portuguese government's]] witnessing and acknowledgement of China's promise to maintain [[Macau]]'s level of autonomy for fifty years after the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|transfer of sovereignty]]. The Time Capsule was closed and covered on 18 December 1999 and it is scheduled to be opened in 2049.&lt;ref name="MD"/&gt; Currently, the Time Capsule is located in the [[Praça do Centro Cultural de Macau]], which was the venue for the transference of sovereignty ceremony.

==History==
President of the Portuguese Republic [[Jorge Fernando Branco de Sampaio]] with the Governor of Macau [[Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira]] hosted the ceremony to seal the Time Capsule in front of [[Pavilhão da Cerimónia de Transferênciade Poderes]], the venue of the ceremony for the [[transfer of sovereignty over Macau]] at noon on 18 December 1999 (the transfer itself occurred on the 20th).&lt;ref name="GCCT" /&gt; At around 13:00, Sampaio and Vieira put the relevant documents with the transfer of sovereignty over Macau into the time capsule one by one. The capsule was then lowered by steel chains into the well to a depth of around {{convert|2|to|3|m}} deep, buried and capped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = 澳门回归"时间囊"今日封存 |publisher= People's Daily |date=18 December 1999 | language = zh |url= http://www.people.com.cn/item/aomen/newfiles1/121849.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The capsule was ceremonially sealed by Sampaio who gave a speech just before midnight on the day of the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/571918.stm Portuguese president bids Macau farewell], BBC, 19 December 1999, retrieved 24 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The time capsule is expected to be opened on 19 December 2049 &amp;ndash; 50 years from its burial, symbolizing the [[Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China]]'s promise of maintaining "[[one country, two system]]s", and guaranteeing a high level of autonomy of Macau ruled by their residents for 50 years after the transfer of sovereignty to People's Republic of China, as witnessed by the [[Portuguese Government]].&lt;ref name="MD" /&gt;

==Contents==
The Time Capsule contains the [[Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau|Joint Declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Portuguese Republic on the question of Macao]], [[Macau Basic Law|Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region]].  Moreover, documents, newspaper clippings and official press releases that related to the transfer of sovereignty during the transition period were also put into the capsule.&lt;ref name="MD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GCCT" /&gt;

'''Tonto National Monument''' is a [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]] in the [[Superstition Mountains]], in [[Gila County, Arizona|Gila County]] of central [[Arizona]]. The area lies on the northeastern edge of the [[Sonoran Desert]] ecoregion, an arid [[habitat]] with annual rainfall of about 16&amp;nbsp;inches (400&amp;nbsp;mm) here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?azroos Roosevelt 1 WNW, Arizona - Climate Summary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. Western Regional Climate Center.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] runs through this area, providing a rare, year-round source of water.

==Cliff dwellings==
Well-preserved [[cliff dwelling]]s were occupied by the [[Salado culture]] during the 13th, 14th, and early 15th centuries. The people farmed in the [[Salt River Valley]], and supplemented their diet by hunting and gathering native plants. The Salado were fine craftspeople, producing some of the most flamboyant polychrome pottery and intricately woven textiles to be found in the Southwest. Some of the artifacts excavated nearby are on display in the [[visitor center]] museum.

The [[Tonto National Monument Archeological District]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tonto National Monument, Lower Ruin]] and [[Tonto National Monument, Upper Ruin]] are [[archeological sites]] that were NRHP-listed in 1989.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;{{efn|All three NRHP-listed areas are included within the National Monument, but the National Monument itself is not NRHP-listed}}

==Natural history==
The National Monument is surrounded by the [[Tonto National Forest]], which includes low plains, desert [[scrubland]], and alpine pine forests.

The Upper Sonoran [[ecosystem]] is known for its characteristic [[saguaro]] cacti. Other common plants include: [[Cylindropuntia|cholla]], [[Opuntia|prickly pear]], hedgehog, and barrel cactus (flowering from April to June); [[yucca]], sotol, and [[agave]]; [[creosote bush]] and [[ocotillo]]; [[Parkinsonia|palo verde]] and [[mesquite]] trees; an amazing variety of colorful wild flowers in good years (February to March); and a lush riparian area which supports large [[Arizona Walnut]], [[Arizona Sycamore]], and [[Celtis|hackberry]] trees.

It also serves as a home for native animals such as whitetail and mule deer, mountain lion, bobcat, three rattlesnake species and many more.

===Wilderness areas===

The area around Tonto National Monument also includes several designated [[National Wilderness Area]]s, including [[Four Peaks Wilderness|Four Peaks]], [[Superstition Wilderness|Superstition]], and [[Salome Wilderness]] Areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24121">'''Word lists by frequency''' are lists of a language's words grouped by frequency of occurrence within some given [[text corpus]], either by levels or as a ranked list, serving the purpose of [[vocabulary acquisition]]. A word list by frequency "provides a rational basis for making sure that learners get the best return for their vocabulary learning effort" ({{Harvnb|Nation|1997|p=}}), but is mainly intended for course writers, not directly for learners. Frequency lists are also made for lexicographical purposes, serving as a sort of [[checklist]] to ensure that common words are not left out. Some major pitfalls are the corpus content, the corpus [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]], and the definition of "[[word]]". While word counting is a thousand years old, with still gigantic analysis done by hand in the mid-20th century, [[natural language processing|natural language electronic processing]] of large corpora such as movie subtitles (SUBTLEX megastudy) has accelerated the research field.

In [[computational linguistics]], a '''frequency list''' is a sorted list of [[word]]s (word types) together with their [[frequency]], where frequency here usually means the number of occurrences in a given [[text corpus|corpus]], from which the rank can be derived as the position in the list.

== Methodology ==

=== Factors ===
Nation ({{harvnb|Nation|1997}}) noted the incredible help provided by computing capabilities, making corpus analysis much easier. He cited several key issues which influence the construction of frequency lists:
* corpus representativeness
* word frequency and range
* treatment of word families
* treatment of idioms and fixed expressions
* range of information
* various other criteria

=== Corpora ===
==== Traditional written corpus ====
Most of currently available studies are based on written [[text corpus]], more easily available and easy to process.

==== SUBTLEX movement ====
However, {{harvnb|New|Brysbaert|Veronis|Pallier|2007}} proposed to tap into the large number of subtitles available online to analyse large numbers of speeches. {{harvnb|Brysbaert|New|2009}} made a long critical evaluation of this traditional textual analysis approach, and support a move toward speech analysis and analysis of film subtitles available online. This has recently been followed by a handful of follow-up studies, providing valuable frequency count analysis for various languages. Indeed, the SUBTLEX movement completed in five years full studies for French ({{harvnb|New|Brysbaert|Veronis|Pallier|2007}}), American English ({{harvnb|Brysbaert|New|2009}}; {{harvnb|Brysbaert|New|Keuleers|2012|p= }}), Dutch ({{harvnb|Keuleers|New|2010|p= }}), Chinese ({{harvnb|Cai|Brysbaert|2010|p= }}), Spanish ({{harvnb|Cuetos|Glez-nosti|Barbón|Brysbaert|2011|p= }}), Greek ({{harvnb|Dimitropoulou|Duñabeitia|Avilés|Corral|Carreiras|2010|p= }}), Vietnamese ({{harvnb|Pham|Bolger|Baayen|2011|p= }}), Portuguese ({{harvnb|Tang|2012|p= }}), Albanian ({{harvnb|Avdyli|Cuetos|2013|p=}}) and Polish ({{harvnb|Mandera|Keuleers|Wodniecka|Brysbaert|2014|p= }}).

=== Lexical unit ===
In any case, the basic "word" unit should be defined. For Latin scripts, words are usually one or several characters separated either by spaces or punctuation. But exceptions can arise, such as English "can't", French "aujourd'hui", or idioms. It may also be preferable to group words of a [[word family]] under the representation of its [[base word]]. Thus, ''possible, impossible, possibility'' are words of the same word family, represented by the base word ''*possib*''. For statistical purpose, all these words are summed up under the base word form *possib*, allowing the ranking of a concept and form occurrence. Moreover, other languages may present specific difficulties. Such is the case of Chinese, which does not use spaces between words, and where a specified chain of several characters can be interpreted as either a phrase of unique-character words, or as a multi-character word.

=== Statistics ===
It seems that [[Zipf's law]] holds for frequency lists drawn from longer texts of any natural language. Frequency lists are a useful tool when building an electronic dictionary, which is a prerequisite for a wide range of applications in [[computational linguistics]].

German linguists define the ''Häufigkeitsklasse'' (frequency class) &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of an item in the list using the [[binary logarithm|base 2 logarithm]] of the ratio between its frequency and the frequency of the most frequent item. The most common item belongs to frequency class 0 (zero) and any item that is approximately half as frequent belongs in class 1. In the example list above, the misspelled word ''outragious'' has a ratio of 76/3789654 and belongs in class 16.
:&lt;math&gt;N=\left\lfloor0.5-\log_2\left(\frac{\text{Frequency of this item}}{\text{Frequency of most common item}}\right)\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor\ldots\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the [[floor function]].

Frequency lists, together with [[semantic network]]s, are used to identify the least common, specialized terms to be replaced by their [[hypernym]]s in a process of [[semantic compression]].

=== Pedagogy ===
Those lists are not intended to be given directly to students, but rather to serve as a guideline for teachers and textbook authors ({{Harvnb|Nation|1997|p=}}). [[Paul Nation]]'s modern language teaching summary encourages first to "move from high frequency vocabulary and special purposes [thematic] vocabulary to low frequency vocabulary, then to teach learners strategies to sustain autonomous vocabulary expansion" ({{harvnb|Nation|2006la}}).

== Effects of words frequency ==
Word frequency is known to have various effects ({{harvnb|Brysbaert|Buchmeier|Conrad|Jacobs|Bölte|Böhl|2011|p= }}; {{harvnb|Rudell|1993|p= }}). Memorization is positively affected by higher word frequency, likely because the learner is subject to more exposures ({{harvnb|Laufer|1997}}). Lexical access is positively influenced by high word frequency, a phenonmenon called [[word frequency effect]] ({{harvnb|Segui|Mehler|Frauenfelder|Morton1982|p= }}) The effect of word frequency is related to the effect of [[Age of Acquisition|age-of-acquisition]], the age at which the word was learned.

== Languages ==
Below is a review of available resources.

=== English ===
{{Further|Most common words in English}}

Word counting dates back to [[Hellenistic]] time. Thorndike &amp; Lorge, assisted by their colleagues, counted 18,000,000 running words to provide the first large scale frequency list in 1944, before modern computers made such projects far easier ({{harvnb|Nation|1997}}).

==== Traditional lists ====
These all suffer from their age. In particular, words relating to technology, such as "blog," which, in 2014, was #7665 in frequency&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wordandphrase.info/frequencylist.asp&lt;/ref&gt; in the Corpus of Contemporary American English,&lt;ref&gt;http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/&lt;/ref&gt; was first attested to in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6794172|title=It's the links, stupid|publisher=The Economist|date=2006-04-20|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peterme.com/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991013021124/http://peterme.com/index.html|archivedate=1999-10-13|title=Peterme.com|last=Merholz|first=Peter|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|year=1999|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kottke.org/03/08/its-weblog-not-web-log|last=Kottke|first=Jason|authorlink=Jason Kottke|title=kottke.org|date=2003-08-26|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not appear in any of these three lists.

;The Teachers Word Book of 30,000 words (Thorndike and Lorge, 1944)
The TWB contains 30,000 lemmas or ~13,000 word families (Goulden, Nation and Read, 1990). A corpus of 18 million written words was hand analysed. The size of its source corpus increased its usefulness, but its age, and language changes, have reduced its applicability ({{harvnb|Nation|1997}}).

;The [[General Service List]] (West, 1953)
The GSL contains 2,000 headwords divided into two sets of 1,000 words. A corpus of 5 million written words was analyzed in the 1940s. The rate of occurrence (%) for different meanings, and parts of speech, of the headword are provided. Various criteria, other than frequence and range, were carefully applied to the corpus. Thus, despite its age, some errors, and its corpus being entirely written text, it is still an excellent database of word frequency, frequency of meanings, and reduction of noise ({{harvnb|Nation|1997}}). This list was updated in 2013 by Dr. Charles Browne, Dr. Brent Culligan and Joseph Phillips as the [[New General Service List]].

;The American Heritage Word Frequency Book (Carroll, Davies and Richman, 1971)
A corpus of 5 million running words, from written texts used in United States schools (various grades, various subject areas). Its value is in its focus on school teaching materials, and its tagging of words by the frequency of each word, in each of the school grade, and in each of the subject areas ({{harvnb|Nation|1997}}).

;The Brown (Francis and Kucera, 1982) LOB and related corpora
These now contain 1 million words from a written corpus representing different dialects of English. These sources are used to produce frequency lists ({{harvnb|Nation|1997}}).

=== French ===
;Traditional datasets
A review has been made by {{harvnb|New|Pallier|3.01}}.
An attempt was made in the 1950s–60s with the [[:fr:Français fondamental|Français fondamental]]. It includes the F.F.1 list with 1,500 high-frequency words, completed by a later F.F.2 list with 1,700 mid-frequency words, and the most used syntax rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pedagogie.ac-amiens.fr/casnav/accueillir/fle_fls/didactique/francais_fondamental.htm |title=Le français fondamental |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704172738/http://pedagogie.ac-amiens.fr/casnav/accueillir/fle_fls/didactique/francais_fondamental.htm |archivedate=July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that 70 grammatical words constitute 50% of the communicatives sentence,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Comprendre et aider les enfants en difficulté scolaire: Le Vocabulaire fondamental, 70 mots essentiels|last1=Ouzoulias|first1=André|publisher=Retz|year=2004|url=http://www.ac-caen.fr/ia50/circo/cou/IMG/pdf/70_mots_essentiels.pdf}} - Citing V.A.C Henmon&lt;/ref&gt; while 3,680 words make about 95~98% of coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Generalities|url=http://www.riviere.info/vbr/livre/ch1generalites.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of 3,000 frequent words is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PDF 3000 French words|url=http://robert.riviere.info/download.php?op=mydown&amp;did=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Ministry of the Education also provide a ranked list of the 1,500 most frequent [[word family|word families]], provided by the lexicologue [[Étienne Brunet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eduscol.education.fr/pid23250-cid50486/vocabulaire.html | title=Maitrise de la langue à l'école: Vocabulaire | publisher=Ministère de l'éducation nationale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Baudot made a study on the model of the American Brown study, entitled "Fréquences d'utilisation des mots en français écrit contemporain".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Baudot|first1=J.|year=1992 |title=Fréquences d'utilisation des mots en français écrit contemporain|edition=|editor=|publisher=Presses de L'Université|place=|isbn=2-7606-1563-4|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the project [[Lexique 3]] provided a list of 135,000 French words, with [[orthography]], [[phonetic]], [[syllabation]], [[part of speech]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], number, frequency, associated [[lexeme]]s, etc., available under an open-source license&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexique.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

;Subtlex
{{harvnb|New|2007|p= }} made a completely new counting based on online film subtitles.

=== Spanish ===
{{Main|Most common words in Spanish}}

There have been several studies of Spanish word frequency ({{harvnb|Cuetos|Glez-nosti|Barbón|Brysbaert|2011|p= }}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spanish word frequency lists|publisher=Vocabularywiki.pbworks.com|url=http://vocabularywiki.pbworks.com/w/page/5254401/Spanish-word-frequency-lists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese ===
Chinese corpuses have long been studied from the perspective of frequency lists. The historical way to learn Chinese vocabulary is based on characters frequency ({{harvnb|Allanic|2003}}). American sinologist [[John DeFrancis]] mentioned its importance for Chinese as a foreign language learning and teaching in ''Why Johnny Can't Read Chinese'' ({{harvnb|DeFrancis|1966}}).  As a frequency toolkit, Da ({{harvnb|Da|1998}}) and the Taiwanese Ministry of Education ({{harvnb|TME|1997}}) provided large databases with frequency ranks for characters and words. The [[Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi|HSK]] list of 8,848 high and medium frequency words in the [[People's Republic of China]], and the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan)]]'s [[Test of Proficiency-Huayu|TOP]] list of about 8,600 common traditional Chinese words are two other lists displaying common Chinese words and characters. Following the SUBTLEX movement, {{harvnb|Cai|Brysbaert|2010|p= }} recently made a rich study of Chinese word and character frequencies.
