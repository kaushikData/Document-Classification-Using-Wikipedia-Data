'''AQUA@home''' was a [[distributed computing]] project operated by [[D-Wave Systems]] and running on the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC) software platform. It closed down in August 2011. Its goal was to predict the performance of [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] [[Adiabatic quantum computation|adiabatic quantum computers]] on a variety of problems arising in fields ranging from [[materials science]] to [[machine learning]]. It designed and analyzed [[quantum computing]] [[algorithm]]s, using [[Quantum Monte Carlo]] techniques.

AQUA@home was the first BOINC project to provide [[multi-threaded]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kamran Karimi |author2=Neil Dickson |author3=Firas Hamze | title = High-Performance Physics Simulations Using Multi-Core CPUs and GPGPUs in a Volunteer Computing Context | journal = International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications | year = 2010 | volume = 25| issue = | pages = 61| doi = 10.1177/1094342010372928 | pmid = | url = https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1004/1004.0023.pdf| arxiv = 1004.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first project to deploy an [[OpenCL]] test application under BOINC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |author1=Kamran Karimi |author2=Neil Dickson |author3=Firas Hamze | title = A Performance Comparison of CUDA and OpenCL | year = 2010 | eprint = 1005.2581|class=cs.PF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-Mustazi''' is an [[impact crater]] located on the anti-Saturn hemisphere of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].  Al-Mustazi was first observed in ''[[Cassini-Huygens Mission|Cassini]]'' images during that mission's March 2005 flyby of Enceladus.  It is located at 20.9° South [[Latitude]], 202.0° West [[Longitude]], and is 10.3 kilometers across.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;  ''Cassini'' observed numerous southwest-northeast trending fractures cutting across the southwest rim of Al-Mustazi, forming canyons several hundred meters deep.  These fractures were deflected by the weakened [[regolith]] produced by the Al-Mustazi impact.&lt;ref name=Barnash&gt;A. N. Barnash ''et al.'' (2006).

''Bull. Am. Astron. Soc.'' '''38''' (3): Presentation Num. 24.06.&lt;/ref&gt;  This deflection produced the pattern of radiating fractures seen along the northeastern rim of Al-Mustazi. 

Al-Mustazi is named after [[Az-Zahir (caliph)|Az-Zahir]], a 13th-century Abbasid caliph and a character in "[[The Hunchback's Tale]]" from ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

The '''binding constant''', or '''association constant''', is a special case of the [[equilibrium constant]] ''K'', and is the inverse of the [[dissociation constant]]. It is associated with the binding and unbinding reaction of receptor (R) and ligand (L) molecules, which is formalized as:

:R + L {{eqm}} RL

The reaction is characterized by the on-rate constant ''k''&lt;sub&gt;on&lt;/sub&gt; and the off-rate constant ''k''&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;, which have units of M&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. In equilibrium, the forward binding transition R + L → RL should be balanced by the backward unbinding transition RL → R + L. That is, 

:&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm on}\,[{\rm R}]\,[{\rm L}] = k_{\rm off}\,[{\rm RL}]&lt;/math&gt;,

where [R], [L] and [RL] represent the concentration of unbound free receptors, the concentration of unbound free ligand and the concentration of receptor-ligand complexes. The binding constant ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;K_{\rm a} = {k_{\rm on} \over k_{\rm off}} = {[{\rm RL}] \over {[{\rm R}]\,[{\rm L}]}}&lt;/math&gt;.

An often considered quantity is the dissociation constant ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which has the unit of concentration, despite the fact that strictly speaking, all association constants are unitless values. The inclusion of units arises from the simplification that such constants are calculated solely from concentrations, which is not the case. Once chemical activity is factored into the correct form of the equation, a dimensionless value is obtained. For the binding of receptor and ligand molecules in solution, the molar [[Gibbs free energy]] Δ''G'', or the binding [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] is related to the dissociation constant ''K''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; via

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta G = R T\ln{{K_{\rm d} \over c^{\ominus}}}&lt;/math&gt;,

in which ''R'' is the [[ideal gas constant]], ''T'' temperature and the standard reference concentration ''c''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1&amp;nbsp;mol/L.

[[File:00664jfCuisine of Bulacan food and fruitsfvf 35.jpg|thumb|A container of [[vanilla]] concentrate]]
A '''concentrate''' is a form of [[Chemical substance|substance]] which has had the majority of its base component (in the case of a liquid: the [[solvent]]) removed. Typically, this will be the removal of [[water]] from a [[solution]] or [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], such as the removal of water from [[fruit juice]]. One benefit of producing a concentrate is that of a reduction in weight and volume for transportation, as the concentrate can be reconstituted at the time of usage by the addition of the solvent.

==Soft drink concentrates==
The process of concentrating orange juice was patented in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crec.ifas.ufl.edu/about/History/PDF/McDowellpatent.pdf|title=Orange Juice Patent|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally developed to provide World War II troops with a reliable source of vitamin C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1417782|title=Minute Maid Concentrated Orange Juice Can|website=National Museum of American History|access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crec.ifas.ufl.edu/about/History/frozenconcentrate.shtml|title=CREC History|website=www.crec.ifas.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the majority of retailed [[orange juice]] is made from reconstituted orange juice concentrate.

Most [[Soft drink|sodas]] and [[soft drink]]s are produced as highly concentrated [[syrup]]s and later diluted with [[carbonated water]] directly before consumption or bottling. Such concentrated syrups are sometimes retailed to the end-consumer because of their relatively low price and considerable [[weight]] savings. [[Condensed milk]] is also produced for [[transport]] weight savings and resistance to spoilage.

Most juice and soda concentrates have a long [[shelf-life]] due to high [[sugar]] content and/or added [[preservative]]s.

Professor Stricker (born {{Birth year and age|1941}} in New York, NY) earned a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1960, a master's degree in chemistry from that same institution in 1961, and a PhD in psychology from [[Yale University]] in 1965.  He held faculty positions at [[McMaster University]] in Hamilton, Ontario from 1967 to 1971, and at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] from 1971 to 1986, before being named University Professor in 1986.&lt;ref name="ppg2016"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Danielewski |first1=Mike |title=Pitt University Honors College dean to return to teaching |url=https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2016/06/16/Pitt-University-Honors-College-dean-announces-return-to-faculty/stories/201606170065 |accessdate=1 December 2018 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=16 June 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His research career spanned four decades and focused on various aspects of [[homeostasis]], most prominently the physiological and behavioral contributions to body [[fluid balance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stricker |first= Edward M |last2= Verbalis |first2= Joseph G |date= 1988|title= Hormones and behavior: The biology of thirst and sodium appetite |journal= [[American Scientist]] |publisher= Sigma Xi |volume= 76 |issue= 3 |pages= 261–267 |jstor= 27855183}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recovery of function following damage to brain [[Catecholamine|catecholamine]]-containing neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zigmond |first= Michael J |author-link= Michael J.

During his academic career, Stricker has served in various administrative roles at the University of Pittsburgh, including director of the behavioral neuroscience program (1983-1986), founding chair of the department of neuroscience (1986-2002), founding director of the center for neuroscience and schizophrenia (1990-1995), co-director of the center for neuroscience (1996-2002), and Dean of the [[University_of_Pittsburgh_Honors_College|University Honors College]] (2011-2017).

His teaching ranged from introductory courses to graduate courses in neuroscience, as well as interdisciplinary honors courses. In recognition of his teaching, the University of Pittsburgh has awarded him the 2001 Tina &amp; David Bellet Teaching Excellence Award and 1992 Chancellor's Distinguished Teaching Award.&lt;ref name="ppg2016" /&gt;

'''''First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong''''' is the official [[biography]] of [[Neil Armstrong]], the [[astronaut]] who became the first man to walk on the [[Moon]], on July 20, 1969. The book was written by [[James R. Hansen]], and was first published in [[2005 in literature|2005]], by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. The book describes Armstrong's involvement in the [[Space policy of the United States|United States space program]] (culminating with the historic [[Apollo 11]] mission), and details his personal life and upbringing.&lt;ref name=Auburn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

The book has received a warm reception from several individuals associated with [[astronomy]] and the promotion of [[spaceflight]]. Examples include the broadcast journalist [[Walter Cronkite]], and the English [[public intellectual]] [[Sir Patrick Moore]].&lt;ref name=Auburn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

==Development==
Academic and author James Hansen is also known for serving as a professor of history at [[Auburn University]] in [[Alabama]]. He additionally serves as director of that institution's Honors College.&lt;ref name=Auburn&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~hansejr/|title=James R. Hansen|publisher=[[Auburn University]] - ''Auburn.edu''|accessdate=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writing process began in October 1999, when Hansen first wrote to Armstrong asking if he could author the book. At first, Armstrong told him that he was too busy, and the astronaut mentioned how he had already turned down several previous offers from well-known authors such as [[Stephen Ambrose]] and [[James A. Michener]]. Hansen persisted, sending what he described as a "goody box" of his work. One of the items included was the author's well-received biography, titled ''From the Ground Up'', of seminal aviation pioneer [[Fred Weick]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Armstrong felt impressed with the style of Hansen's work. In June 2002, Armstrong and Hansen signed a formal agreement. Two months later, Armstrong signed an official letter for Hansen that said Hansen had his full support and encouraged others to provide what he needed to write a book. While numerous publications had described aspects of Armstrong's long career and personal endeavors, to varying degrees, ''First Man'' became the first official book to detail the astronaut's life, including much information both before and after the [[Apollo program]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

After questioning as to why, after years of reluctance, he had finally consented to a full biography, Armstrong replied simply: "It was time."&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

==Contents and details==
[[File:Barack Obama with Apollo 11 crew in the Oval Office 2009-07-20.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] converses with Armstrong (right) alongside the astronaut's [[Apollo 11]] colleagues [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] (center) and [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin Jr.]] (left) in the [[Oval Office]], the men meeting for the 40th anniversary of the lunar landing.]]

The book describes Armstrong's pleasant and broadly conventional early life. The young man becomes more and more fascinated by [[aircraft]] and flying, and he even earns his [[Pilot licensing and certification|pilot's licence]] before he has qualifications to drive an automobile. Armstrong's father remarks that his son "never had a girl" and "didn't need a car" but simply "had... to get out to that airport."&lt;ref name=Auburn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

The young Armstrong becomes a naval aviator. Management of the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) takes an interest in Armstrong's combination of [[calmness]] and personal skill coupled with his above-average [[intellect]]. Although contrasting somewhat with many of his colleagues, the [[Apollo 11]] crew winding up as "amiable strangers", he attracts widespread respect. The fact that Armstrong gets chosen to be "first down" on the [[Moon#Surface geology|lunar surface]] is a surprise, with astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin Jr.]] being expected to get priority. The mission itself proceeds spectacularly well, and Armstrong gives his famous line: "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."&lt;ref name=Auburn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

The historic nature of the event means that Armstrong must adapt to being one of the most famous men on the planet, a peculiar situation which the astronaut finds challenging. Given the gravity of the Apollo program and the sacrifices made so that the lunar mission succeeded, Armstrong feels determined to make sure that his status as the 'first man on the moon' is never exploited for anyone's petty gain. Interested in spreading his knowledge to younger generations, he eschews a [[celebrity]] status by serving as a lecturer in [[engineering]] at the [[University of Cincinnati]]. While shying away from the personal spotlight, as an individual, the astronaut spends decades advancing the cause of further [[spaceflight]] in terms of providing advice to those at NASA, being in close touch with multiple figures.&lt;ref name=Auburn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

==Reception==
[[England|English]] [[astronomer]] and [[public intellectual]] [[Sir Patrick Moore]] praised the book. Writing for the publication ''[[Times Higher Education]]'', Moore stated that he considered the work an "outstanding success", finding it "immaculately researched and is packed with detail" while still being "written in a way that will appeal to readers of all kinds". He concluded, "This is an important book and should be in every scientific library."&lt;ref name=Auburn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/a-giant-leap-that-left-few-traces/200902.article&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States|American]] media figure [[Walter Cronkite]] lauded ''First Man'' as well, remarking:
{{quote|Even if you think you know everything about Neil Armstrong and America's historic mission to be the first to land men on the Moon, this remarkable book by Dr. James Hansen contributes a host of fascinating new insights into not only the character of Apollo 11's enigmatic commander but also into the nature of the spacefaring enterprise itself. It is a book for all time.&lt;ref name=Auburn/&gt;}}

==Film adaptation==
{{main|First Man (film)}}
[[File:Ryan Gosling by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Actor [[Ryan Gosling]] (pictured here in 2017) stars as Neil Armstrong in the film adaption of ''First Man'']]

In early 2003, [[actor]]-[[Film director|director]] [[Clint Eastwood]] and production people at the [[Film studio|studio]] [[Warner Bros.]] bought the film rights to ''First Man''. Eastwood had previously directed as well as starred in the [[2000 in film|2000]] space-themed movie ''[[Space Cowboys]]'', though he stated that he would likely not appear on camera in ''First Man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/14/entertainment/et-quick14.2|title=Eastwood to direct astronaut film biography|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=March 14, 2003|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project wound up in [[development hell]] despite significant interest. Armstrong himself died on August 25, 2012, before any actual filming took place.

[[Universal Pictures]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yahoo.com/movies/universal-sets-ryan-goslings-neil-armstrong-biopic-fall-183452970.html&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately took up the ''First Man'' project in the mid-[[2010s]]. [[Damien Chazelle]], a director receiving critical acclaim for his work in 2016's ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'', signed onto the film's production. Actor [[Ryan Gosling]], who starred in ''La La Land'', joined as well. Given his role as the book's author, Hansen was attached to [[Film producer|co-produce]] the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/11/ryan-gosling-neil-armstrong-movie-first-man-damien-chazelle-1201636876/|title=Ryan Gosling Orbiting Damien Chazelle's Neil Armstrong Movie at Universal?|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Mike|last=Fleming Jr|date=November 24, 2015|accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/damien-chazelle-ryan-gosling-neil-armstrong-biopic-first-man-1201949407/|title=Ryan Gosling, Damien Chazelle to Reteam on Neil Armstrong Biopic|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Justin|last=Kroll|date=December 29, 2016|accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WaterScrewPerpetualMotion.png|thumb|right|An engraving of [[Robert Fludd]]'s 1618 "water screw" perpetual motion machine.]]
The history of [[perpetual motion]] machines dates at least back to the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pomeroy |first1=Ross |title=Perpetual Motion Is Impossible... Right? |url=https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2013/06/perpetual-motion.html |website=realclearscience.com |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For millennia, it was not clear whether perpetual motion devices were possible or not, but modern theories of [[thermodynamics]] have shown that they are impossible. Despite this, many attempts have been made to construct such machines, continuing into modern times. Modern designers and proponents sometimes use other terms, such as "overunity", to describe their inventions.

There are two types of perpetual motion machines:
* ''Perpetual motion machines of the first kind'' are those devices that violate the [[first law of thermodynamics]], the principle of conservation of energy, creating energy out of nothing. Most attempts fall into this category.
* ''Perpetual motion machines of the second kind'' are devices that violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Even though they obey the principle of conservation of energy, they attempt extraction of work from a single heat reservoir, violating the principle of no [[entropy]] decrease in an isolated macroscopic thermodynamic system.

===Pre-19th century===
There are some unsourced claims&lt;ref&gt;Mark E. Eberhart(2007):''Feeding the fire: the lost history and uncertain future of mankind's energy'', p.14&lt;/ref&gt; that a perpetual motion machine called the "magic wheel" (a wheel spinning on its axle powered by lodestones) appeared in 8th-century [[Bavaria]]. This historical claim appears to be unsubstantiated though often repeated.

Early designs of perpetual motion machines were done by Indian [[Indian mathematics|mathematician]]–[[Indian astronomy|astronomer]] [[Bhāskara II|Bhaskara II]], who described a wheel ([[Bhāskara's wheel]]) that he claimed would run forever.&lt;ref name="Lynn Townsend White 1960 p. 522-526"&gt;[[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]] (April 1960). "Tibet, India, and Malaya as Sources of Western Medieval Technology", ''The American Historical Review'' '''65''' (3), p. 522-526.&lt;/ref&gt;

A drawing of a perpetual motion machine appeared in the sketchbook of [[Villard de Honnecourt]], a 13th-century  French master [[stonemason|mason]] and architect. The sketchbook was concerned with [[mechanics]] and [[architecture]]. Following the example of Villard, [[Peter of Maricourt]] designed a magnetic globe which, if it were mounted without friction parallel to the celestial axis, would rotate once a day. It was intended to serve as an automatic [[armillary sphere]].&lt;ref name="Lynn Townsend White 1960 p. 522-526"/&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] made a number of drawings of devices he hoped would make free [[energy]]. Leonardo da Vinci was generally against such devices, but drew and examined numerous overbalanced wheels.&lt;ref&gt;Time-Life Books (1991). ''Inventive Genius''. 143 pages. Page 125. {{ISBN|0-8094-7699-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Mark Anthony Zimara, a 16th-century Italian scholar, proposed a self-blowing windmill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=022yYXnS_GQC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=%22Directions+for+constructing+a+Perpetual+Motion+Machine+without+the+Use+of+Water+or+a+Weight%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0CRBPA8XUb&amp;sig=HG5hN7WSjTWvjywmNe5Qs4lIFtQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E-R7TfqZCqKD0QGHkKXrAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Directions%20for%20constructing%20a%20Perpetual%20Motion%20Machine%20without%20the%20Use%20of%20Water%20or%20a%20Weight%22&amp;f=false |title=Perpetual Motion: The History of an Obsession |first=Arthur W.

Various scholars in this period investigated the topic. In 1607 [[Cornelius Drebbel]] in "Wonder-vondt van de eeuwighe bewegingh" dedicated a Perpetuum motion machine to [[James I of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drebbel.net/Wondervondt.pdf |title=Wonder-vondt van de eeuwighe bewegingh |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by Heinrich Hiesserle von Chodaw in 1621.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drebbel.net/1621%20PPM.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310193332/http://www.drebbel.net/1621%20PPM.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Boyle]] devised the "perpetual vase" ("perpetual goblet" or "hydrostatic paradox") which was discussed by [[Denis Papin]] in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' for 1685.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/pascal.html "Inventor of the Week Archive: Pascal : Mechanical Calculator"], May 2003. "Pascal worked on many versions of the devices, leading to his attempt to create a perpetual motion machine. He has been credited with introducing the roulette machine, which was a by-product of these experiments."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Bernoulli]] proposed a fluid energy machine. In 1686, [[Georg Andreas Böckler]], designed a "self operating" self-powered [[water mill]] and several perpetual motion machines using balls using variants of [[Archimedes' screw]]s. In 1712, [[Johann Bessler]] ([[Orffyreus]]), claimed to have experimented with 300 different perpetual motion models before developing what he said were working models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Simaneck |first1=Donald E. |title=Perpetual Futility |url=https://www.lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/museum/people/people.htm |website=lockhaven.edu |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1760s, [[James Cox (inventor)|James Cox]] and [[John Joseph Merlin]] developed [[Cox's timepiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Arthur W. J. G. Perpetual Motion: The History of an Obsession. St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|0-312-60131-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cox claimed that the timepiece was a true perpetual motion machine, but as the device is powered by changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] via a [[mercury barometer]], this is not the case.

In 1775, the [[French Academy of Sciences|Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris]] made the statement that the Academy "will no longer accept or deal with proposals concerning perpetual motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scaffer |first1=Simon |title=The Show That Never Ends: Perpetual Motion in the Early Eighteenth Century |journal=The British Journal for the History of Science |date=June 1995 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=157 - 189 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4027676?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===

====19th century====
In 1812, [[Charles Redheffer]], in [[Philadelphia]], claimed to have developed a "generator" that could power other machines. The machine was open for viewing in Philadelphia, where Redheffer raised large amount of money from the admission fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/nov/13/research.highereducation2|title=Too good to be true|last=Radford|first=Tim|date=2003-11-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redheffer moved his machine to New York, after his cover was blown in Philadelphia, while applying for government funding.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Clifford B. (April 1961). "Why won't they work?". ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage Magazine]]''. American Heritage Publishing Company. Retrieved 28 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that [[Robert Fulton]] exposed Redheffer's schemes during an exposition of the device in New York City (1813). Removing some concealing wooden strips, Fulton found a [[catgut]] belt drive went through a wall to an attic. In the attic, a man was turning a crank to power the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/redheffer.html|title=This page has moved|author=|date=|website=www.museumofhoaxes.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information originally at www.skepticfiles.org/skep2/pmotion2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi438.htm|title=No. 438: Redheffer's PMM-I|author=|date=|website=www.uh.edu|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827, [[Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet]] devised a machine running on [[capillary action]] that would disobey the principle that water seeks its own level, so to produce a continuous ascent and overflow. The device had an inclined plane over pulleys. At the top and bottom, there travelled an endless band of sponge, a bed and, over this, again an endless band of heavy weights jointed together. The whole stood over the surface of still water. Congreve believed his system would operate continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perpetual Motion |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/perpetual-motion-1911-11-18/ |website=scientificamerican.com |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In 1868, an Austrian, Alois Drasch, received a US patent for a machine that possessed a "thrust key-type [[gear]]ing" of a [[rotary engine]]. The vehicle driver could tilt a trough depending upon need. A heavy ball rolled in a cylindrical trough downward, and, with continuous adjustment of the device's levers and power output, Drasch believed that it would be possible to power a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp-gramatke.de/pmm_physics/german/page0300.htm|title=HPs Perpetuum Mobile Physik. Die Geschichte der schiefen Ebene und   ihrer Verwendung in perpetua Mobilia.|author=|date=|website=www.hp-gramatke.de|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, E.P. Willis of New Haven, Connecticut made money from a "proprietary" perpetual motion machine. A story of the overcomplicated device with a hidden source of energy appears in the ''[[Scientific American]]'' article "The Greatest Discovery Ever Yet Made". Investigation into the device eventually found a source of power that drove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogyimagesofhistory.com/images/amotion.JPG|title=Image of Scientific American|author=|date=|website=genealogyimagesofhistory.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Ernst Worrell Keely]] claimed the invention of an induction resonance motion motor. He explained that he used "etheric technology". In 1872, Keely announced that he had discovered a principle for power production based on the vibrations of [[tuning fork]]s. Scientists investigated his machine which appeared to run on water, though Keely endeavoured to avoid this. Shortly after 1872, [[venture capitalist]]s accused Keely of fraud (they lost nearly five million dollars). Keely's machine, it was discovered after his death, was based on hidden air pressure tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  | first =  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = Keely's Secret Disclosed.; Scientists Examine His Laboratory and Discover Hidden Tubes in Proof of His Deception. | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | pages =  | year =  | date = 20 January 1899 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/01/20/102408633.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1900 to 1950====
In 1900, [[Nikola Tesla]] claimed to have discovered an abstract principle on which to base a perpetual motion machine of the [[Perpetual motion classification#Classification|second kind]]. No prototype was produced. He wrote:{{cquote|A departure from known methods – possibility of a "self-acting" engine or machine, inanimate, yet capable, like a living being, of deriving energy from the medium – the ideal way of obtaining motive power.&lt;ref name="Tesla 2018 p.

[[David Unaipon]], Australian inventor, had a lifelong fascination with perpetual motion. One of his studies on Newtonian mechanics led him to create a [[Sheep shearing|shearing]] machine in 1910 that converted curvilineal motion into straight line movement.

In the 1910s and 1920s, Harry Perrigo of Kansas City, Missouri, a graduate of [[MIT]], claimed development of a free energy device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kclibrary.org/localhistory/list.cfm?list=sub&amp;SubjectareaID=77176 Harry E. Perrigo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008094240/http://www.kclibrary.org/localhistory/list.cfm?list=sub&amp;SubjectareaID=77176 |date=2007-10-08 }}, a vertical file at the [http://www.kclibrary.org/ Kansas City Public Library] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], described as follows: "Photos, illustrations, and information on Harry Perrigo, a local inventor of a "free energy" device in the 1910s-1920s turning out to be a hoax. Energy source of "invention" supposedly "from thin air" or from "ether waves" but in actually from a hidden battery."&lt;/ref&gt; Perrigo claimed the energy source was "from thin air" or from aether waves. He demonstrated the device before the Congress of the United States on December 15, 1917. Perrigo had a pending application&lt;ref&gt;filed December 31, 1925; Serial Number 78,719&lt;/ref&gt; for the "Improvement in Method and Apparatus for Accumulating and Transforming Ether Electric Energy". Investigators report that his device contained a hidden motor battery.&lt;ref&gt;Citations originally at www.kclibrary.org resources Subject area ID 77176&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===

====1951 to 1980====
During the middle of the 20th century, [[Viktor Schauberger]] claimed to have discovered some special vortex energy in water. Since his death in 1958, people are still studying his works.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010409231732/http://www.frank.germano.com/viktorschauberger.htm Who was Viktor Schauberger?] frank.germano.com. (archived version).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Josef Papp]] (sometimes referred to as Joseph Papp or Joseph Papf) supposedly developed an alternative [[car engine]] that used [[noble gas|inert gases]]. He gained a few investors but when the engine was publicly demonstrated, an explosion killed one of the observers and injured two others. Papp blamed the accident on interference by  physicist [[Richard Feynman]], who later shared his observations in an article in ''Laser'', the journal of the Southern Californian Skeptics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/comments/papparticle2.html|title=Feynman on Papp|author=|date=|website=www.museumofhoaxes.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papp continued to accept money but never demonstrated another engine.

On December 20 of 1977, Emil T. Hartman received {{US patent|4215330}} titled "Permanent magnet propulsion system". This device is related to the [[Simple Magnetic Overunity Toy]] (SMOT).

Potter&lt;/ref&gt; article.]]
Paul Bauman, a German engineer, developed a machine referred to as the "Testatika"&lt;ref&gt;Jeane Manning, The coming energy revolution. Reviews Avery Pub. Group, April 1, 1996.

[[Guido Franch]] reportedly had a process of [[Alchemy|transmuting]] water molecules into high-[[octane]] [[gasoline]] compounds (named [[Mota fuel]]) that would reduce the price of gasoline to 8 cents per gallon. This process involved a green [[Powder (substance)|powder]] (this claim may be related to the similar ones of John Andrews (1917)). He was brought to court for [[fraud]] in 1954 and [[acquittal|acquitted]], but in 1973 was convicted. [[Judge|Justice]] William Bauer and Justice Philip Romiti both observed a demonstration in the 1954 case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_399.html|title=Is there a pill that can turn water into gasoline?|author=|date=14 December 1984|website=straightdope.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Otis T. Carr]] from [[Oklahoma]] formed a company to manufacture [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]-styled [[spacecraft|spaceship]]s and [[hovercraft]]. Carr sold [[stock]] for this [[Commerce|commercial]] endeavour. He also promoted [[Second law of thermodynamics|free energy]] [[machine]]s. He claimed inspiration from [[Nikola Tesla]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keelynet.com/gravity/carr3.htm|title=Otis Carr Flying Machine - KeelyNet 12/23/01|author=|date=|website=www.keelynet.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, physicist [[Richard Feynman]] discussed a [[Brownian ratchet]] that would supposedly extract meaningful work from [[Brownian motion]], although he went on to demonstrate how such a device would fail to work in practice.&lt;ref name="Feynman" &gt;{{cite book | last = Feynman | first = Richard P. | title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 1 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 1963 | location = Massachusetts, USA | pages = Chapter 46 | isbn =0-201-02116-1 | nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, David Hamel produced the Hamel generator, an "[[antigravity]]" device, supposedly after an [[alien abduction]]. The device was tested on ''[[MythBusters]]'' where it failed to demonstrate any lift-generating capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2006/12/episode_68_christmas_tree_ligh.html|title=Annotated Mythbusters: Episode 68: Christmas Tree Lights, Antigravity Device, Vodka Myths IV|author=|date=|website=kwc.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[MythBusters]] Episode 68: Christmas Tree Lights, Antigravity Device, Vodka Myths IV {{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode-tab-05.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109031748/http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode-tab-05.html |archivedate=2008-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USPatent4151431-2.png|thumb|222px|right|Howard R. Johnson's US Patent 4151431]]
[[Howard Robert Johnson]] developed a permanent magnet motor and, on April 24, 1979, received {{US patent|4151431}}.[The United States Patent office main classification of his 4151431 patent is as a "electrical generator or motor structure, dynamoelectric, linear" (310/12).] Johnson said that his device generates motion, either rotary or linear, from nothing but permanent magnets in rotor as well as stator, acting against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Science &amp; Mechanics|author=Jorma Hyypia|title=Amazing Magnet-Powered Motor |date= Spring 1980|url=http://www.newebmasters.com/freeenergy/sm-pg45.html }} (Cover illustration is [http://www.rexresearch.com/johnson/1johnson.htm#scimech here].)&lt;/ref&gt; He estimated that permanent magnets made of proper hard materials should lose less than two percent of their magnetization in powering a device for 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qsYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lmcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6671,6264163 |title=Industrial Engineer Gets Patent for a Device Powered by Magnets |date=April 29, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Joseph Westley Newman]] applied for a patent on a [[direct current]] electrical motor which, according to his book ''[[The Energy Machine of Joseph Newman]]'' did more mechanical work than could be accounted for by the electrical power supplied to it.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Energy Machine of Joseph Newman | publisher=Joseph Newman Publishing Company | author=Newman, Joseph | year=1998 | location=Scottsdale, AZ, USA | isbn=0-9613835-8-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newman's patent application was rejected in 1983.&lt;ref name="USPTO_Newman"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO1983000963 | title=Patent Application: "ENERGY GENERATION SYSTEM HAVING HIGHER ENERGY OUTPUT THAN INPUT" (failed) | publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office | date=17 March 1983 | accessdate=7 September 2016 | author=Newman, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USPTO_MPEP_2107.01"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/2100_2107_01.htm | title=Manual of Patent Examining Procedure | publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office | work=2107.01 General Principles Governing Utility Rejections (R-5) - 2100 Patentability.

Newman sued the [[US Patent and Trademark Office]] in US District Court, which ordered the [[National Bureau of Standards]] to test his machine; they informed the Court that Newman's device did not produce more power than supplied by the batteries it was connected to, and the Court found against Newman.&lt;ref name="Newman_v_Quigg"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16083607426021457478&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr | title=Newman v.

====1981 to 1999====
Dr. Yuri S. Potapov of [[Moldova]] claims development of an  [[over-unity]] electrothermal water-based generator (referred to as "Yusmar 1"). He founded the YUSMAR company to promote his device. The device has failed to produce over unity under tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtech.org/experiments/|title=EXPERIMENTS - Earth Tech|author=|date=|website=earthtech.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.padrak.com/ine/CSOURCES.html|title=COMMERCIAL SOURCES|author=|date=|website=www.padrak.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CETI claimed development of a [[Patterson Power Cell|device]] that outputs small yet anomalous amounts of heat, perhaps due to [[cold fusion]]. Skeptics state that inaccurate measurements of [[friction]] effects from the cooling flow through the pellets may be responsible for the results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phact.org/e/skeptic/ceti.htm CETI : Patterson Cell – taking a scientific look&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040426204625/http://www.phact.org/e/skeptic/ceti.htm |date=2004-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000s====
[[Image:MEGcircuit.png|thumb|right|222px|Motionless electromagnetic generator circuit as explained in US Patent 6362718]]	

The motionless electromagnetic generator (MEG) was built by Tom Bearden. Allegedly, the device can eventually sustain its operation in addition to powering a load without application of external electrical power. Bearden claimed that it didn't violate the first law of thermodynamics because it extracted [[zero-point energy|vacuum energy]] from the immediate environment.&lt;ref name=Gardner&gt;[[Martin Gardner]], [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/dr._bearden_vacuum_energy/ "'Dr' Bearden's Vacuum Energy"], ''Skeptical Inquirer'', January/February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Critics dismiss this theory and instead identify it as a perpetual motion machine with an unscientific rationalization.&lt;ref name=Gardner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn040502.html "Free Energy: Perpetual Motion Scams are at an All-Time High"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622223211/http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn040502.html |date=2012-06-22 }}, ''What's New'', APS, 5 April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn050302.html "Vacuum Energy: How Do You Patent a Perpetual-Motion Machine?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622223334/http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn050302.html |date=2012-06-22 }}, ''What's New'', APS, 3 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parkJune2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.fnal.gov/~prebys/talks/perpetual_motion/perpetual_motion_public.pdf Energy: No Such Thing as a Free Lunch"], Eric Prebys, Guest Lecture at Columbia University, November 4, 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2527">The '''Human Behavior and Evolution Society''', or HBES, is an interdisciplinary, international society of researchers, primarily from the social and biological sciences, who use [[modern evolutionary theory]] to help to discover [[human nature]] — including evolved emotional, cognitive and sexual adaptations.  It was founded on October 29, 1988 at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="gen" /&gt;

The official [[academic journal]] of the society is ''[[Evolution and Human Behavior]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Official Journal | work = HBES.com | accessdate = 12 September 2015 | url = http://www.hbes.com/about/journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the society has held annual conferences since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Conference | work = HBES.com | accessdate = 12 September 2015 | url = http://www.hbes.com/conference/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2015, the president is anthropologist [[Elizabeth Cashdan]] of the [[University of Utah]]. Past-president include biologist [[Randy Thornhill]] of the [[University of New Mexico]] and Mark Flinn of the [[University of Missouri]]. The president-elect is psychologist [[Robert Kurzban]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Officers &amp; By–Laws | work = HBES.com | accessdate = 12 September 2015 | url = http://www.hbes.com/about/officers/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The membership in broadly international, and consists of scholars from many fields, such as [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[medicine]], [[law]], [[philosophy]], [[biology]], [[economics]] and [[sociology]].  Despite the diversity, HBES members "all speak the common language of [[Darwinism]]."&lt;ref name="gen"&gt;{{cite web | title = HBES General Info | work = HBES.com | accessdate = 12 September 2015 |url=http://www.hbes.com/geninfo.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20060313190109/http://www.hbes.com/geninfo.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''idioglossia''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ιδιογλωσσία ''idioglōssia'', from ''idio-'' "personal" and ''glōssa'' "tongue") is an [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] [[language]] invented and spoken by only one person or very few people.  Most often, ''idioglossia'' refers to the "private languages" of young children, especially [[twin]]s, the latter being more specifically known as [[cryptophasia]], and commonly referred to as '''twin talk''' or '''twin speech'''.

Children who are exposed to multiple languages from birth are also inclined to create idioglossias, but these languages usually disappear at a relatively early age, giving way to use of one or more of the languages introduced.

==Examples==

===Case studies===
* Sam and Ren McEntee, 17-month-old twins.&lt;ref name="twin2"&gt;Moisse, Katie (March 30, 2011). [http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/twin-talk-video-babies-babble-adults/story?id=13246486 "Babies Learn How Conversation Works Before They Learn Words"]. [[ABC News]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[June and Jennifer Gibbons]]
* [[Poto and Cabengo|Kennedy twins]] of [[San Diego, California]], who were subjected to intensive study, including an exhaustive analysis of their language. (They named themselves "Poto and Cabengo")

===Media===
* The 1994 film ''[[Nell (film)|Nell]]'', starring [[Jodie Foster]], depicts a woman who speaks an idioglossia. The stage play on which it is based is also called ''[[Idioglossia (play)|Idioglossia]]''.
* The [[concept album]] ''[[The Perfect Element, part I]]'', by [[Pain of Salvation]], is centered on a song titled "Idioglossia".
* [[James Joyce|James Joyce's]] novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' was written using an idioglossia.
* ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'' Series 3 Episode 9 shows [[Katie Fitch|Katie]] and [[Emily Fitch]] using an idioglossia.
* [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Sherri and Terri|Sherri and Terri]] on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' sometimes use an idioglossia.
* The two teenage protagonists of the film ''[[Disco Pigs]]'', Darren and Sinéad, use an idioglossia.
* Singer, musician, and composer [[Lisa Gerrard]] (of [[Dead Can Dance]] and in her solo career) sings many of her songs in an idioglossia that she has developed since the age of twelve.
* ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998) – Tuck and Roll.
* The twin brothers Jim and Tim Possible from the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Kim Possible]]'' often use twinspeak.
* Twins Marilyn and Carolyn Arnold from ''[[The Baby-Sitters Club]]'' book series used this early on.
* In the 2005 ''[[Law &amp; Order: SVU]]'' episode "Identity", teenage twins Logan and Lindsay Stanton  ([[Reiley McClendon]]) speak to each other in twin language while both are being interrogated in a murder investigation by Detectives [[Elliot Stabler|Stabler]] and [[Olivia Benson|Benson]] ([[Christopher Meloni]] and [[Mariska Hargitay]], respectively). Detective Stabler recognizes their language as "twin speak" because he himself is the [[Elliot Stabler#Family|father of twins]] and remarks that his twins had their own language when they were young as well.  
*In the 2010 ''[[American Dad!]]'' episode "Son of Stan", Steve and his temporarily created clone, Steve-arino (voice of [[Scott Grimes]]), were briefly seen using an idioglossia in speaking to each other.
* In episode 212 of television show ''[[Rules of Engagement (TV series)|Rules of Engagement]]'', twins attending a party speak in twin language and state that twins often have their own language that only they can understand.
* The television series ''[[Second Chance (2016 TV series)|Second Chance]]'' have twin sister and brother Mary and Otto Goodwin who sometimes use twin speak to communicate with each other.
* In 2015, the musician ponyphonic released a song titled ''Idioglossary'' on [[Bandcamp]] about the language of close, young siblings.

'''The International Institute of Sociology (IIS)''' is a scholarly organization which seeks to stimulate and facilitate the development, exchange, and application of scientific knowledge to questions of sociological relevance. Membership is open to all sociologists as well as to scholars in neighbouring disciplines.

Created in [[Paris]] in 1893 by [[René Worms]], it is the oldest continuous sociological association in existence. Its first congress was held in Paris in October 1894&lt;ref name=Kon /&gt;{{rp|360}} under the chairmanship of René Worms, which formalised the foundation of this institution.&lt;ref name=Kon&gt;A History of Classical Sociology. Ed. by [[Igor Kon]]. Moscow, 1989. {{ISBN|5-01-001102-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|169}} The ''Révue internationale de sociologie'', founded the year before, became the printed organ of the Institute.&lt;ref name=Kon /&gt; Since its foundation the goal of the IIS has been to bring together sociologists from around the world. It has a longstanding tradition of promoting discussions on the most crucial theoretical issues of the day and on the practical use of social scientific knowledge. Among its members and associates were prominent scholars such as: [[Franz Boas]], [[Roger Bastide]], [[Lujo Brentano]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Gustave Le Bon]], [[Karl Mannheim]], [[William F. Ogburn]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]], [[Georg Simmel]], [[Werner Sombart]], [[Gabriel Tarde]], [[Ferdinand Toennies]], [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[Lester F. Ward]], [[Eliezer Ben-Rafael]], [[Sidney Webb]], [[Max Weber]], [[Florian Znaniecki]], and [[Ludwig Gumplowicz]]&lt;ref name=Kon /&gt;{{rp|169}}

Every two years the IIS organizes a world congress in Sociology. Recent IIS World Congresses were held in Yerevan (2009), Budapest (2008), Stockholm (2005), Beijing (2004), Kraków (2001), Tel Aviv (1999), Köln (1997), Trieste (1995), Paris (1993), Kobe (1991), and Rome (1989).

In addition to the congresses and other meetings, the IIS publishes the ''Annales de l'Institut International de Sociologie'' / ''Annals of the International Institute of Sociology''. First published in 1895 after the first world congress, this book series seeks to present cutting-edge research and synthesis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3025">{{For|kinematic waves in traffic flow|Traffic flow}}

In gravity and pressure driven fluid dynamical and geophysical mass flows such as ocean waves, avalanches, debris flows, mud flows, flash floods, etc., '''kinematic waves''' are important mathematical tools to understand the basic features of the associated wave phenomena.
&lt;ref name=takahashi_07&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Takahashi |first=T. 
 |year=2007
 |title=Debris Flow: Mechanics, Prediction and Countermeasures
 |publisher=[[Taylor and Francis, Leiden]]
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
These waves are also applied to model the motion of highway [[traffic flows]].&lt;ref name=lighthill_whitham_1955&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lighthill |first=M.J.|last2=Whitham |first2=G.B.  |year= 1955 |title=On kinematic waves. I: Flood movement in long rivers. II: A theory of traffic flow on long crowded roads
 |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]
 |volume=229A |issue=4 |pages=281–345
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=newell_1993&gt;{{cite journal |last=Newell |first=G.F.  |year= 1993 |title=A simplified theory of kinematic waves in highway traffic, Part I: General theory
 |journal=[[Transpn. Res. B]]
 |volume=27B |issue=4 |pages=281–287
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In these flows, mass and momentum equations can be combined to yield a kinematic wave equation. Depending on the flow configurations, the kinematic wave can be linear or non-linear, which depends on whether the wave [[Phase speed|celerity]] is a constant or a variable. Kinematic wave can be described by a simple [[partial differential equation]] with a single unknown field variable (e.g., the flow or wave height, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;) in terms of the two independent variables, namely the time (&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;) and the space (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) with some parameters (coefficients) containing information about the physics and geometry of the flow. In general, the wave can be advecting and diffusing. However, in simple situation, the kinematic wave is mainly advecting.

== Kinematic wave for debris flow ==

Non-linear kinematic wave for debris flow can be written as follows with complex non-linear coefficients:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + C \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} = D \frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial x^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the debris flow height, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the downstream channel position, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure gradient and the depth dependent nonlinear variable
wave speed, and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a flow height and pressure gradient dependent variable diffusion term.
This equation can also be written in the [[conservative form]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} =0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the generalized flux that depends on several physical and geometrical parameters of the flow, flow height and the hydraulic pressure gradient. For &lt;math&gt;F=h^2/2&lt;/math&gt;, this equation reduces to the [[Burgers' equation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17204">Here is a list of the hottest and coldest temperatures ever recorded in various locations in [[Sweden]] since 1860. Due to the continental nature of the Swedish climate, the entire country is prone to absolute extremes, even though averages are normally moderate in most of the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="133243">The qualifications for this '''list of Maine lakes''' is that the lake is located partially or entirely in [[Maine]], named, and has a surface area of more than {{convert|10|acre|m2}}.  This makes it legally a [[Great pond (law)|great pond]] unless it is dammed, smaller than {{convert|10|acre|m2}} prior to damming, smaller than {{convert|30|acre|m2}} afterwards, and entirely bounded by land owned by a single landowner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://janus.state.me.us/legis/statutes/38/title38sec436-a.html Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. 38, § 436-A.]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are at least 2,677 lakes or ponds in Maine with no name (not including 2 whose name begins "Unnamed"), 222 of which would be on this list if named.  There are also at least 1,022 named lakes too small to make this list.

[[Image:Maine-counties-map.gif|thumb|Map of the [[List of counties in Maine|16 counties]] of the [[State of Maine]]]]

The lakes are organized by county, and from largest to smallest surface area in each county.  Some lakes are located in or border multiple counties; in these cases they are listed in the single county assigned to them in the primary reference for this list.  In some cases, alternative or former names of the lakes are given inside parentheses.  The list of adjoining towns is not always complete.

'''Microfinance sponsors''' are organizations that facilitate small [[loans]], typically in developing countries. The process is often called [[peer to peer lending]]. They handle loan administration on behalf of others including individual lenders and lending agencies, but do not loan their own money. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kota|first1=Ina|title=Microfinance: Banking for the Poor|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2007/06/basics.htm|accessdate=9 September 2017|agency=IMF|publisher=Finance and Development|date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt061210"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Narang|first1=Sonia|title=Web-Based Microfinancing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section4.t-6.html|accessdate=9 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=December 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|220px|thumb|right|"It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things."&lt;br/&gt;- [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], ''[[The Prince]]'']]

In [[cognitive science]] and [[evolutionary psychology]], '''Machiavellian intelligence''' is the capacity of an entity to be in a successful [[political science|political]] engagement with [[social group]]s. The first introduction of this concept to [[primatology]] came from [[Frans de Waal]]'s book "Chimpanzee Politics" (1982), which described social maneuvering while explicitly quoting [[Machiavelli]]. Also known as '''machiavellianism''', it is the art of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] in which others are socially manipulated in a way that benefits the user.

==Machiavellian behaviors==
Machiavellian intelligence may be demonstrated by [[behavior]]s including:
*[[blame|Blaming]] and [[forgiveness]];
*[[lie|Lying]] and [[truth|truth-telling]];
*Making and breaking [[Political alliance|alliances]];
*Making and breaking [[promise]]s;
*Making and breaking [[wiktionary:rule|rule]]s;
*[[Misleading]] and misdirection.

==Criticisms==
===Food and nutrient factors===
The claim that large brains are linked to large social groups in [[primate]]s and [[cetacean]]s, on which the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis is based, is criticized by a number of researchers for overlooking the availability of food as a common limiting factor for brain size and social group size. Among primates as well as cetaceans, there are some opportunistic species that eat most types of food and other species that are specialised in particular types of food, as well as differences in the overall availability of food between different geographical regions in which the animals live. Some critics of Machiavellian intelligence argue that species that have to keep their use of nutrients down due to food poverty or specialisation in a rare type of food lowers average brain size for species that live in smaller groups, making big brains falsely appear to be linked to large groups due to the common causes of opportunistic foraging for nutritious food and a rich supply of food. These critics also cite that the "exceptions" in the form of small-brained primates in very large groups typically eat abundant but nutrient-poor foods (such as [[gelada]]s that eat grass), as predicted by the food-based model, and argue that the higher individual need for nutrients put on by large brains causes groups to become smaller if the species have the same degree of digestive specialisation and environmental availability of food.&lt;ref&gt;Primate brain size is predicted by diet but not sociality - 2017, Alex R. DeCasien, Scott A. Williams &amp; James P. Higham https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0112 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evolution: Eating away at the social brain, Chris Venditti https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0122 &lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism that relates to food regards the assumption that modern [[hunter-gatherer|hunters and gatherers]] are living in marginal environments displaced by [[agriculture|farming peoples]] and that people in [[paleolithic]] times supposedly lived in larger social groups than hunters and gatherers do today. The researchers who put forward that criticism cite observations that hunters and gatherers often trade with farmers who live nearby and/or steal food from them, opportunities that were not available before agriculture was invented. The critics therefore argue that our prehistoric ancestors before agriculture lived in even smaller groups than hunters and gatherers do today, in groups smaller than those of the most opportunistic non-human apes as a result of the greater requirement for nutrients in human brains.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter-Gatherers: An Interdisciplinary Perspective - 2001 edition, Catherine Panter-Brick, Robert H. Layton, Peter Rowley-Conwy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barely Surviving or More than Enough?: The environmental archaeology of subsistence, specialisation and surplus food production - 2013, Maaike Groot, Daphne Lentjes, Jørn Zeiler&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex social groups without intelligence===
Some researchers criticize the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis from observations of [[social insect]]s that form societies that are organized and yet have very small brains. Some of these insects, such as [[Jack jumper ant|Jack jumpers]] and [[paper wasp]]s have hierarchical societies in which each individual treat every other in accordance with their status, as opposed to the disorganized herds as which the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis depict social animals with small brains.&lt;ref&gt;Ants at Work: How an Insect Society is Organized - 1999, Deborah M. Gordon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Insects, Science &amp; Society - 2012, David Pimentel&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term refers to [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' (1513) and to the hypothesis that the techniques which lead to certain kinds of political [[wikt:success|success]] within large [[social group]]s are also applicable within smaller groups, including the [[family|family-unit]]. The term "everyday politics" was later introduced in reference to these various methods. These arguments are based on research by primatologists such as [[Nicholas Humphrey]] (1975).

A number of proposals for a '''crewed [[Venus]] flyby''' have been considered since the start of the [[space age]].

==Apollo Applications Program==

[[File:VenusFlybyCutaway.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cutaway diagram of the Venus flyby spacecraft.]]

[[NASA]] considered a manned flyby of Venus in the mid-1960s as part of the [[Apollo Applications Program]], using hardware derived from the [[Apollo program]]. Launch would have taken place on October 31, 1973, with a Venus flyby on March 3, 1974 and return to Earth on December 1, 1974.

===Background===
The proposed mission would use a [[Saturn V]] to send three men to fly past Venus in a flight which would last approximately one year. The [[S-IVB]] stage would be a '[[wet workshop]]' similar to the original design of [[Skylab]]. In this concept, the interior of the fuel tanks would be filled with living quarters and various equipment that did not take up a significant amount of volume. The S-IVB would then be filled with fuel as normal and used to accelerate the craft on its way to Venus. Once the burn was complete, any remaining fuel was vented to space, and then the tank could be used as living space.

Only so much equipment could be carried in the hydrogen tank without taking up too much room, while other pieces could not be immersed in [[liquid hydrogen]] and survive. These sorts of systems would instead be placed in the interstage area between the S-IVB and the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] (CSM), known as the [[Apollo spacecraft#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter .28SLA.29|Spacecraft-LM Adapter]] (SLA), which normally held the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] on lunar missions. To maximize the amount of space available in this area, the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Propulsion System|Service Propulsion System]] engine of the CSM would be replaced by two LM [[Descent Propulsion System|Descent Propulsion System engine]]s. These had much smaller engine bells, and would lie within the Service Module instead of extending out the end into the SLA area. This also provided redundancy in the case of a single-engine failure. These engines were responsible for both course correction during the flight as well as the braking burn for Earth re-entry.

Unlike the Apollo lunar missions, the CSM would perform its [[transposition, docking, and extraction|transposition and docking maneuver]] with the S-IVB stage before the burn to leave Earth orbit rather than after. This meant the astronauts would fly 'eyeballs-out', the thrust of the engine pushing them out of their seats rather than into them. This was required because there was only a short window for an abort burn by the CSM to return to Earth after a failure in the S-IVB, so all spacecraft systems needed to be operational and checked out before leaving the [[parking orbit]] around Earth to fly to Venus.

Precursors to the Venus flyby would include an initial orbital test flight with an S-IVB 'wet workshop' and basic docking adapter, and a year-long test flight taking the S-IVB to a near-geostationary orbit around the Earth.

===Scientific objectives===

The mission would measure:
* Atmospheric density, temperature and pressure as functions of altitude, latitude and time.
* Definition of the planetary surface and its properties.
* Chemical composition of the low atmosphere and the planetary surface.
* Ionospheric data such as radio reflectivity and electron density and properties of cloud layers.
* Optical astronomy - UV and IR measurements above the Earth's atmosphere to aid in the determination of the spatial distribution of hydrogen.
* Solar astronomy - UV, X-ray and possible infrared measurements of the solar spectrum and space monitoring of solar events.
* Radio and radar astronomy - radio observations to map the brightness of the radio sky and to investigate solar, stellar and planetary radio emissions; radar measurements of the surface of Venus and Mercury
* X-ray astronomy - measurements to identify new X-ray sources in the galactic system and to obtain additional information on sources previously identified.
* Data on the Earth-Venus interplanetary environment, including particulate radiation, magnetic fields and meteoroids.
* Data on the planet Mercury, which will be in mutual planetary alignment with Venus approximately two weeks after the Venus flyby

=== Mission development ===
The mission would have been implemented in a series of two development flights and one production flight, designated as phases A through C.

====Phase A====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MockupOfPhaseAApolloToVenusTest.jpg|thumb|right|Computer simulation of Phase-A test, in an 'eyeballs-out' burn. (From [[Orbiter (simulator)|Orbiter Space Flight Simulator]])]] --&gt;
Phase A of the plan would have launched a 'wet workshop' S-IVB and a standard Block II [[Apollo CSM]] into orbit on a Saturn V. The crew would separate the CSM from the S-IVB by blowing off the [[Apollo spacecraft#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter .28SLA.29|SLA]] panels, then perform a [[Transposition and Docking]] maneuver similar to that conducted on the lunar flights, in order to dock with the docking module attached to the front of the S-IVB. Optionally they could then use the S-IVB engine to launch them into a high orbit before they vented any remaining fuel into space and entered the S-IVB fuel tanks to conduct experiments for a few weeks. After evaluating the use of the S-IVB as a long-term habitat for astronauts, they would separate the CSM from the S-IVB and return to Earth.

====Phase B====
Phase B would test the Venus flyby spacecraft in a long duration mission in high orbit. A Saturn V would launch a Block III CSM designed for long-term spaceflight and a modified S-IVB with the Environmental Support Module required for the real Venus flyby, and following the transposition and docking maneuver the S-IVB engine would carry the spacecraft to a circular orbit at an altitude of about 25,000 miles around the Earth. This altitude would be high enough to be clear of Earth's radiation belts while exposing the spacecraft to an environment similar to that of a trip to Venus, yet close enough to Earth that the astronauts could use the CSM to return in a few hours in an emergency.

Power would probably be provided by solar panels similar to those used on [[Skylab]], as fuel cells would require a very large amount of fuel to operate for a year. Similarly the fuel cells in the SM used to provide power on lunar flights would be replaced by batteries which would provide enough power for the duration of launch and re-entry operations.

====Phase C====
Phase C would be the actual crewed flyby, using a [[Block IV CSM]] and an updated version of the Venus flyby S-IVB which would carry a large radio antenna for communication with Earth and two or more small probes which would be released shortly before the flyby to enter the atmosphere of Venus. The Block IV CSM has LM engines replacing the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module .28SM.29|Service Propulsion System]] engines, batteries to replace the fuel cells, and other modifications to support long-range communication with Earth and the higher re-entry velocities required for the return trajectory compared to a return from lunar orbit.

The Phase C mission was planned to launch in late October or early November 1973, when the velocity requirements required to reach Venus and the duration of the resulting mission would be at their lowest. After a brief stay in Earth parking orbit to check out the spacecraft the crew would head for Venus: in the event of a major problem during the Trans-Venus Injection burn, they would have roughly an hour to separate the CSM from the S-IVB and use the SM engine to cancel out most of the velocity they gained from the burn. This would put them into a highly elliptical orbit which would typically bring them back to Earth for a re-entry two to three days later. Beyond that time the SM engine would not have enough fuel to bring the CSM back to Earth before the SM batteries ran out of power: it would literally be 'Venus or Bust'.

After a successful S-IVB burn, the spacecraft would pass approximately 3000 miles from the surface of Venus about four months later. The flyby velocity would be so high that the crew would only have a few hours for detailed study of the planet. At this point, one or more robotic probe landers would separate from the main craft and land on Venus.

During the rest of the mission the crew would perform astronomical studies of the Sun and Mercury, which they would approach within 0.3 [[astronomical unit]]s.

==TMK-MAVR==

A variation of the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[TMK]] mission planning for a crewed mission to Mars involved a flyby of Venus on the return voyage, and was given the code name "MAVR" (MArs - VeneRa), meaning Mars - Venus. However, the TMK program was cancelled after the [[N1 rocket]] that was needed to loft the mission failed to fly successfully.

==Inspiration Mars==

As a "Plan B" in case the proposed [[Inspiration Mars]] fly-by of Mars misses its 2018 launch window, in November 2013 [[Dennis Tito]] proposed a different mission architecture whereby the mission craft would first fly-by Venus, using Venus in a [[gravitational slingshot]] to speed the craft's onward journey to Mars. The proposed mission, which would launch in 2021, would take the Inspiration Mars craft to within 800 kilometres of the Venusian surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24633-ambitious-mars-joyride-cannot-succeed-without-nasa.html?page=1|title=Ambitious Mars joy-ride cannot succeed without NASA|last=Grossman|first=Lisa|publisher=New Scientist Magazine|date=November 21, 2013|accessdate=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Micro Men''''', working title '''''Syntax Era'''''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1459467/releaseinfo#akas&lt;/ref&gt; is a one-off BBC [[drama]] television show set in the late 1970s and the early-mid 1980s, about the rise of the British [[home computer]] market. It focuses on the rivalry between Sir [[Clive Sinclair]] (played by [[Alexander Armstrong (comedian)|Alexander Armstrong]]), who developed the [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[Chris Curry]] (played by [[Martin Freeman]]), the man behind the [[BBC Micro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sam Wollaston |title=Micro Men |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/oct/09/micro-men-sinclair-curry |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=25 April 2012 |location=London |date=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

The drama is centred on two of the leading players and their respective companies in the home computer market of the late 1970s and early 1980s focusing on the race to win a grant from the [[BBC]] to become the provider of a home computer for the BBC's programming for schools.&lt;ref name="guardian 2009"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/oct/08/armstrong-freeman-micro-men-bbc | title=Micro Men preview | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=8 October 2009 | accessdate=13 March 2012 | author=Arnott, Jack | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain parts of the drama are based on historical fact whilst others are dramatisation and a version of events at the time.

The main characters are [[ZX Spectrum]] creator [[Clive Sinclair]] and [[BBC Micro]] creators [[Chris Curry]], [[Sophie Wilson]], [[Steve Furber]] and [[Hermann Hauser]].  (The real-life Wilson also makes a brief cameo as a barmaid.)

== Cast ==
* [[Alexander Armstrong]] as Clive Sinclair
* [[Martin Freeman]] as Chris Curry
* [[Edward Baker-Duly]] as Hermann Hauser
* [[Sam Phillips (actor)|Sam Phillips]] as Steve Furber
* [[Derek Riddell]] as Nigel Searle

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The programme was created by independent production company Darlow Smithson and was written by [[Tony Saint]], directed by [[Saul Metzstein]] and produced by Andrea Cornwell.&lt;ref name="telegraph 2009"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6255809/Micro-Men-Sir-Clive-Sinclair-and-the-heyday-of-British-computing.html | title=Micro Men: Sir Clive Sinclair and the heyday of British computing | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=7 October 2009 | accessdate=13 March 2012 | author=Lyle, Peter | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced as a BBC Drama, shot in the UK, with some scenes shot in and around the colleges of Cambridge on 15 July 2009. Computers were supplied by [[The Centre for Computing History]], then in [[Haverhill, Suffolk|Haverhill]].&lt;ref name="cambridge-news 2012"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Haverhill/Museum-piece-computers-programmed-into-TV-show.htm?ID=454280 | title=Museum-piece computers programmed into TV show | work=Haverhill Weekly News | publisher=Cambridge Newspapers | date=7 October 2009 | accessdate=2 May 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515222121/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Haverhill/Museum-piece-computers-programmed-into-TV-show.htm?ID=454280 | archivedate=15 May 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also supplied other technical props, including the {{nowrap|[[Sinclair C5]]}}, and Jason Fitzpatrick, director of the museum, played the part of David Johnson-Davies.&lt;ref name="Centre for Computing History News 2009"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/news/5293/Syntax-Era-Micro-Men-Trailer/ | title=Syntax Era / Micro Men Trailer | work=Centre for Computing History | publisher=Centre for Computing History | date=21 August 2009 | accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme's [[working title]] was ''Syntax Era''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=British Comedy Guide: Micro Men |url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/micro_men/ |work=British Comedy Guide |publisher= |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The titles use green 'computer' lettering similar to the real 1980s monitors to which BBC Microcomputers would have typically been connected.

=== Soundtrack ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2018}}

The soundtrack is notable for its use of early 1980s [[electronica]], which was considered futuristic-sounding at the time, and produced by similar [[Synthesizer|synthesis]] methods to those found on 8-bit microcomputers:

* Pulstar - [[Vangelis]] (opening title) (from the 1976 album ''[[Albedo 0.39]]'')
* Planet Earth - [[Duran Duran]]
* Computer World - [[Kraftwerk]] (2009 remaster)
* Pocket Calculator - Kraftwerk (2009 remaster)
* A fifth of Beethoven - [[Walter Murphy]] (from [[Saturday Night Fever]])
* Title from the Carpetbaggers - Jimmy Smith
* Zoolookologie - Jean Michel Jarre
* Two Tribes - [[Frankie goes to Hollywood]]
* 99 Red Balloons - [[Nena]]
* Computer World 2 - Kraftwerk (2009 remaster)
* Pipes of Peace - [[Paul McCartney]]
* Oxygene Part 4 - [[Jean Michel Jarre]] (closing sequence/credits)

== Release ==
It was first shown on [[BBC Four]] on 8 October 2009.

==Reaction==
When asked about the show in an interview for ''[[The Independent]]'' Clive Sinclair himself replied "It was a travesty of the truth. It just had no bearing on the truth. It was terrible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sir Clive Sinclair: Down but never out, the eternal optimist is back|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/sir-clive-sinclair-down-but-never-out-the-eternal-optimist-is-back-1863277.html|date=10 January 2010|publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Microcosm: E. coli and the New Science of Life''''' is a 2008 book by popular science writer [[Carl Zimmer]]. The book presents an overview of genetics research and [[genetic engineering]] by telling the story about the [[Escherichia coli]] (''E. coli'') family of bacteria.

''E. coli'' has been a popular organism to study for researchers since its discovery in 1885. The [[Escherichia coli (molecular biology)|K-12 strain of ''E. coli'']] got its [[genome]] mapped in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9278503 |year=1997 |last1=Blattner |first1=FR |last2=Plunkett G |first2=3rd |last3=Bloch |first3=CA |last4=Perna |first4=NT |last5=Burland |first5=V |last6=Riley |first6=M |last7=Collado-Vides |first7=J |last8=Glasner |first8=JD |last9=Rode |first9=CK |last10=Mayhew |first10=G.

The '''Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford''' (the '''Migration Observatory''') is a project providing analysis of immigration and migration issues affecting the [[United Kingdom]]. It is a part of the [[Oxford University]]'s [[Centre on Migration Policy and Society]] (COMPAS) and was launched in March 2011 with the broad aim of improving public discourse on migration in the UK by looking at key migration issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/independence-what-it-means-us | title=Independence: What it means to us | work=Migration Observatory | publisher=[[University of Oxford]] | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The Migration Observatory’s outputs are used by the media in the UK and its staff are often quoted in the media on issues regarding immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/in-the-news |title=Observatory in the news |work=Migration Observatory | publisher=University of Oxford | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The Migration Observatory is a project of COMPAS, a multidisciplinary research centre at Oxford University. Funding for the Observatory comes from [[Unbound Philanthropy]], the [[Barrow Cadbury Trust]], the [[Paul Hamlyn Foundation]], the [[Esmée Fairbairn Foundation]] and the [[Economic and Social Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/about-us/funders |title=Funders | work=Migration Observatory | publisher=University of Oxford | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8274">In [[economics]], '''money illusion''', or '''price illusion''', is the tendency of people to think of currency in [[real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal, rather than real]], terms. In other words, the numerical/face value (nominal value) of money is mistaken for its [[purchasing power]] (real value) at a previous point in the general price level (in the past). This is false, as modern [[fiat currency|fiat currencies]] have no intrinsic value and their real value is derived from all the underlying value systems in an economy, e.g., sound government, sound economics, sound education, sound legal system, sound defence, etc. The change in this real value over time is indicated by the change in the [[Consumer Price Index]] over time.

The term was coined by [[Irving Fisher]] in ''Stabilizing the Dollar''. It was popularized by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in the early twentieth century, and [[Irving Fisher]] wrote an important book on the subject, ''The Money Illusion'', in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Money Illusion | last = Fisher | first = Irving | publisher = Adelphi Company | year = 1928 |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of money illusion is disputed by [[monetary]] economists  who contend that people act rationally (i.e. think in real prices) with regard to their wealth.&lt;ref name=poverty&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Marianne Bertran |author2=Sendhil Mullainathan |author3=Eldar Shafir  |last-author-amp=yes |title=A behavioral-economics view of poverty|journal=The American Economic Review|date=May 2004|volume=94|issue=2|pages=419–423|jstor=3592921|doi=10.1257/0002828041302019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eldar Shafir]], [[Peter A. Diamond]], and [[Amos Tversky]] (1997) have provided  [[empirical evidence]] for the existence of the effect and it has been shown to affect behaviour in a variety of experimental and real-world situations.&lt;ref name="Shafir"&gt;{{Citation |last=Shafir |first=E. |last2=Diamond |first2=P. A. |last3=Tversky |first3=A. |year=1997 |title=On Money Illusion |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=112 |issue=2 |pages=341–374 |url= |doi=10.1162/003355397555208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shafir et al.&lt;ref name="Shafir" /&gt; also state that money illusion influences economic behaviour in three main ways:

*[[Sticky (economics)|Price stickiness]]. Money illusion has been proposed as one reason why [[nominal price]]s are slow to change even where [[Inflation (economics)|inflation]] has caused [[real price]]s or costs to rise.
*[[Contracts]] and [[laws]] are not indexed to inflation as frequently as one would rationally expect.
*Social discourse, in formal media and more generally, reflects some confusion about [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real and nominal value]].

Money illusion can also influence people's perceptions of outcomes. Experiments have shown that people generally perceive an approximate 2% cut in nominal income with no change in monetary value as unfair, but see a 2% rise in nominal income where there is 4% inflation as fair, despite them being almost rational equivalents. This result is consistent with the 'Myopic Loss Aversion theory'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Benartzi | first1 = Shlomo | last2 = Thaler | first2 = Richard H. | year = 1995 | title = Myopic Loss Aversion and the Equity Premium Puzzle | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume = 110 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–92 | jstor = 2118511 | doi = 10.2307/2118511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the money illusion means nominal changes in price can influence demand even if real prices have remained constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|first=Don|last= Patinkin
|journal=Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
|volume= 1|issue= 1 |year= 1969|pages= 46–70
|jstor=1991376
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations and implications==

Explanations of money illusion generally describe the phenomenon in terms of [[heuristics]]. Nominal prices provide a convenient rule of thumb for determining value and real prices are only calculated if they seem highly [[Salience (communication)|salient]] (e.g. in periods of [[hyperinflation]] or in long term contracts).

Some have suggested that money illusion implies that the negative relationship between inflation and unemployment described by the [[Phillips curve]] might hold, contrary to more recent [[macroeconomic]] theories such as the "expectations-augmented Phillips curve".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Advanced macroeconomics
|first=David|last= Romer
|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year= 2006|page=252|isbn=9780072877304}}&lt;/ref&gt; If workers use their nominal wage as a reference point when evaluating wage offers, firms can keep real wages relatively lower in a period of high inflation as workers accept the seemingly high nominal wage increase. These lower real wages would allow firms to hire more workers in periods of high inflation.

Money illusion is believed to be instrumental in the Friedmanian version of the [[Phillips curve]]. Actually, money illusion is not enough to explain the mechanism underlying this Phillips curve. It requires two additional assumptions. First, prices respond differently to modified demand conditions: an increased aggregate demand exerts its influence on commodity prices sooner than it does on labour market prices. Therefore, the drop in unemployment is, after all, the result of decreasing real wages and an accurate judgement of the situation by employees is the only reason for the return to an initial (natural) rate of unemployment (i.e. the end of the money illusion, when they finally recognize the actual dynamics of prices and wages). The other (arbitrary) assumption refers to a special informational asymmetry: whatever employees are unaware of in connection with the changes in (real and nominal) wages and prices can be clearly observed by employers. The new classical version of the Phillips curve was aimed at removing the puzzling additional presumptions, but its mechanism still requires money illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbács |first=Peter |title=The Theory of New Classical Macroeconomics.

In optical apparatuses such as curved mirrors, lenses or prisms, chromatic aberrations, i.e., unintended separation of colors, may occur. However, when optical aberrations distort monochromatic light the effect is called monochromatic aberration.

There are five known monochromatic aberrations:

#  [[Spherical aberration]]
#  [[Coma (optics)|Coma]]
#  [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|Astigmatism]]
#  [[Curvature of field]]
#  [[Distortion (optics)]]

Crew names, dates (launch, lunar landing, and return), and serial number 416 (back)|300px|[[Apollo 11]] space-flown silver Robbins Medallion from the first spaceflight to [[Moon landing|land on the Moon]]. Presented to [[Wally Schirra]] by [[Neil Armstrong]].]]

'''NASA space-flown Gemini and Apollo medallions''' were mission-specific commemorative [[medal]]lions—often [[astronaut]]-designed—which were approved by [[NASA]] and carried aboard the mission spacecraft into orbit. Beginning with the first manned [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] mission in 1965, commemorative medallions were prepared for the astronauts at their request. These were produced by a company only known as Fliteline and were struck either in a pewter-colored base metal, sometimes painted a gold color, or [[sterling silver]], and were flown on all 10 manned Gemini missions. A Fliteline medallion was designed and produced for [[Apollo 1]], but was never officially flown after a disastrous [[Apollo 1#Fire|cabin fire]] during a launch rehearsal killed the flight crew.   

The Robbins Company of Attleboro, Massachusetts, was contracted in 1968 to produce commemorative medallions beginning with [[Apollo 7]], the first manned Apollo flight since the Apollo 1 disaster. These were purchased by astronauts and support crew personnel at NASA Astronaut Flight Office, and a total of over 3,000 sterling silver Robbins medallions were flown into space across the 12 manned flights of the Apollo program. Some of these were later sold in public auction for up to $60,000. The basic elements of the medallion design are consistent throughout the 12 medallions in the series, with the main design element and the mission name on the obverse, mission dates on the reverse,  [[List_of_Apollo_missions#Manned_Apollo_missions|primary flight crew]] names on either the obverse or reverse, and a serial number either on the lower reverse or on the rim.  A very small number of Apollo Robbins medallions were also struck in 14k gold, generally ordered by the mission crew as a personal memento. Sterling silver Robbins medallions have continued to be struck for every [[Human spaceflight|manned]] NASA [[spaceflight]], including [[Skylab]] and [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]] missions.{{Sfn|Weinberger|2006|p=6}}{{#tag:ref |Robbins medallions were also struck for the crews of the [[List of International Space Station expeditions|Expeditions]] to the [[International Space Station]]. Medallions for the first nine expedition crews (2000–04) have been documented.{{Sfn|Weinberger|2006|pp=67–70}}| group="nb"}}

[[Numismatics|Numismatic]] souvenirs have accompanied astronauts on nearly every early [[spaceflight]].{{Sfn|Gibbs|2013|p=14}} [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] astronauts carried small light-weight [[souvenir|mementos]] on their missions, often in the form of US [[Coins of the United States dollar|coins]] or [[banknote]]s. On the first [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|sub-orbital]] flight ([[Mercury-Redstone 3]]), [[Alan Shepard]] carried with him four one-dollar [[Silver certificate (United States)#Small-size silver certificates|silver certificates]] which were subsequently signed by him, other Mercury astronauts, and support staff becoming [[short snorter]]s. [[John Glenn]], piloting the first manned U.S. orbital spaceflight [[Mercury-Atlas 6]] also carried several one-dollar silver certificates. 

Space-flown numismatic items are also known for early [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] missions. On the first manned Gemini flight ([[Gemini 3]]), [[Gus Grissom|Grissom]] and [[John Young (astronaut)|Young]] brought 50 two-dollar bills.{{Sfn|Gibbs|2013|p=26}} Young also made history for smuggling "contraband" on board the flight, in the form of a corned-beef sandwich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title= 50 Years Ago This Week a Sandwich Was Smuggled into Space |publisher= Washingtonpost.com |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/03/24/50-years-ago-this-week-a-sandwich-was-smuggled-into-space/|accessdate= 5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title= The Case of the Contraband Corned Beef Sandwich   |publisher= Discovery.com |url= http://news.discovery.com/space/the-case-of-the-contraband-corned-beef-sandwich.htm|accessdate= 5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=  Astronaut John Young Brought a Corned Beef Sandwich into Space |publisher= Businessinsider.com |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/astronaut-john-young-brought-a-corn-beef-sandwich-into-space-2012-8|accessdate= 5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/GT03_TEC.PDF |title=Composite Air-to-ground and Onboard Voice Tape Transcription of the GT-3 Mission |publisher=National Astronautics and Space Administration |page=45 |date=April 1965 |accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gemini mission space-flown Fliteline medallions==
Beginning with the first manned Gemini mission in March 1965, commemorative medallions were prepared for the astronauts at their request. It is unclear who prepared these early medallions, only that each individual box containing a medallion bore the word "Fliteline".{{Sfn|Starck|2008|p=95}} It is unknown how many gold and silver colored medallions were prepared for each mission, and how many were space-flown versus unflown. Fliteline medallions were prepared for each of the manned Gemini flights, as well as the ill-fated [[Apollo 1]] mission.

==Apollo mission space-flown Robbins medallions==
The Robbins Company was founded in 1892 by jeweler Charles M. Robbins, in [[Attleboro, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="tharperobbins"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://archive.org/details/Httpsweb.archive.orgweb20141219014213httpwww.tharperobbins.comabouthistory| title = TharpeRobbins Company History | last = | first = | date = | website = www.engage2excel.com| publisher = TharpeRobbins Company| access-date =| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They began designing and producing commemorative badges for Ohio in 1913,{{Sfn|Wood|1913|p=433}} and South Dakota in 1917.{{Sfn|South Dakota |1917|p=125}} In 1935, the first 1,000 badges of a new design for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] were produced by Robbins.{{Sfn|Federal Bureau of Investigation|2008|p=120}} The Robbins Company also struck the [[Olympic medal]]s for the [[1932 Winter Olympics|1932 Winter Games]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="tharperobbins"/&gt;

===Robbins medallions===
The Apollo 1 cabin fire in January 1967 put manned spaceflight on hold. The crew of [[Apollo 7]], designated to be the return to manned spaceflight, began working with the Robbins Company later in 1967 to produce commemorative mission medallions.{{Sfn|Starck|2008|p=95}}{{Sfn|Weinberger|1999|p=6}} Commissioned by the NASA [[NASA Astronaut Corps|Astronaut Flight Office (AFO)]], the medallions were financed entirely through the orders placed by astronauts and support crew personnel.{{Sfn| Weinberger |1999|p=6}}{{Sfn|Still|1995|p=194}} Only those directly affiliated with the AFO were eligible as purchasers,{{Sfn|Starck|2008|p=96}} and they were bound by their employment contract not to commercialize the medallions,{{Sfn|Still|1995|p=195}} as NASA was concerned about any appearance that the astronauts might profit from the flown medallions.{{Sfn| Weinberger |1999|p=7}}

One (or more) of the astronauts from the flight crew worked directly with the Robbins Company to design the mission medallion.{{Sfn|Weinberger|1999|p=6}} The basic elements of the medallion design are consistent throughout the Project Apollo series. The main design element along with the mission name is located on the obverse. The names of the flight crew can be found on either the obverse or reverse. The mission dates are located on the reverse. Beginning with Apollo 11, special fields were designed for the reverse of the medallion that allowed for engraved dates of launch, lunar landing, and return. Also on the reverse (or sometimes the edge) is the medallion serial number. The size of most Robbins Apollo medallions falls roughly between a current US [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] ({{convert|24.3|mm|in|abbr=on}}) and a [[Kennedy half dollar]] ({{convert|30.6|mm|in|abbr=on}}).

The medallions were struck in sterling silver two to three months prior to the scheduled mission, though it is unclear whether serial numbers were added pre or post-flight.{{Sfn|Weinberger|1999|p=7}} The medallions were stored in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Service Module]] during flight and on missions involving a lunar landing, a small number were brought to the lunar surface aboard the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].{{Sfn|Weinberger|1999|p=7}} The flown medallions were returned to the Robbins Company after the flight to have the dates engraved and for a final polishing.{{Sfn|Weinberger|1999|p=7}} Except where noted, all medallions struck for Apollo 7–14 were flown,{{Sfn|Weinberger|1999|pp=33–36}} and serial numbers for Apollo 14–17 medallions appear on the rim.{{Sfn|Weinberger|1999|p=8}}

Apollo Robbins medallions were also struck, in very small numbers, in [[Fineness#Carat|14k]] gold.{{sfn|Numismatic Guarantee Corporation |2007}}{{#tag:ref | Gold medallions struck and flown: Apollo 7 (5–7), Apollo 8 (3), Apollo 9 (3), Apollo 10 (4), Apollo 11 (3), Apollo 12 (7), Apollo 13 (6), Apollo 14 (6), Apollo 15 (6), Apollo 16 (5), and Apollo 17 (6).{{Sfn|Weinberger |1999}}| group="nb"}} These medallions were generally ordered by the mission crew as a personal memento of their flight and were often taken to the lunar surface in the Landing Module.{{Sfn|Weinberger |2006|pp=19–20}} For the duration of the Apollo program, Robbins medallions (3–7 gold and 80–450 silver per mission) were flown into space.{{Sfn| Starck |2008|p=95}}{{Sfn|Weinberger |1999}}{{Sfn|Weinberger |2006}}

{{Culture of Pakistan}}
[[Pakistan]] has several official '''national symbols''' including a historic document, a flag, an emblem, an anthem, a memorial tower as well as several national heroes. The symbols were adopted at various stages in the existence of Pakistan and there are various rules and regulations governing their definition or use. The oldest symbol is the [[Lahore Resolution]], adopted by the [[All-India Muslim League|All India Muslim League]] on 23 March 1940, and which presented the official demand for the creation of a separate country for the Muslims of [[British Raj|India]]. The Minar-e-Pakistan memorial tower which was built in 1968 on the site where the Lahore Resolution was passed. The national flag was adopted just before independence was achieved on 14 August 1947. The national anthem and the state emblem were each adopted in 1954. There are also several other symbols including the national animal, bird, flower and tree.

== National anthem ==
{{Main|Qaumi Tarana}}
The national anthem of Pakistan or ''Qaumī Tarāna'' Urdu: {{nastaliq|قومى ترانہ}}, is played during any event involving the hoisting of the flag, for example Republic Day (23 March) and Independence Day (14 August). The Constituent Assembly had not adopted a national anthem by the time Pakistan became independent, so when the flag was hoisted at the independence ceremony it was accompanied by the song, "''Pakistan Zindabad, Azadi Paendabad''". Muhammad Ali Jinnah asked a Lahore-based Hindu writer, [[Jagan Nath Azad]], to write a national anthem for Pakistan.&lt;ref name="first_anthem"&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_19-6-2005_pg7_31

A National Anthem Committee was formed in 1948, but it had difficulty finding suitable music and lyrics. The impending state visit of the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] in 1950, resulted in the hasty adoption of a three stanza composition by [[Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla]]. Initially it was performed without lyrics for the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] on 10 August 1950&lt;ref name="antheminfo"&gt;{{cite web

However, the anthem was not officially adopted until August 1954.&lt;ref name="antheminfo" /&gt; The National Anthem Committee eventually approved lyrics written by Abu-Al-Asar [[Hafeez Jullandhuri]] and the new national anthem was first played properly on Radio Pakistan on 13 August 1954.&lt;ref name="played"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four components of the emblem are a crescent and star crest above a shield, which is surrounded by a wreath, below which is a scroll.&lt;ref name="emblem1" /&gt; The crest and the green colour of the emblem are traditional symbols of Islam. The quartered shield in the centre shows cotton, wheat, tea and jute, which were the major crops of Pakistan at independence and signify the agricultural base of the economy.&lt;ref name="emblem1" /&gt; The floral wreath, surrounding the shield, represents the floral designs used in traditional [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] art and emphasizes the cultural heritage of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="emblem1" /&gt;

== Nation's Motto ==
{{Main|Iman Ittihad Nazm}}
The scroll supporting the shield contains Muhammad Ali Jinnah's motto in Urdu, which reads from right to left: ({{nastaliq|&lt;big&gt;ایمان ،   اتحاد ، نظم و ضبط &lt;/big&gt;}}) "Iman, Ittehad, Nazm" translated as "Faith, Unity, Discipline" and are intended as the guiding principles for Pakistan.&lt;ref name="basicfacts" /&gt;

As of 2016 it seems to have been abandoned.

==Subprojects==
* Shor's Algorithm
* Shor's Algorithm DP
* GSCE-SV
* ALX
* Weird Engine

Shor's Algorithm and Shor's Algorithm DP were the main subprojects of OProject@Home. The objective was to test quantum algorithms (e.g. [[Shor's algorithm]]) of quantum computing. GSCE-SV verifies the correctness of [[Goldbach's conjecture]], while ALX is a Non-CPU-intensive (nci) subproject capable of running on [[ARM architecture|ARM-based CPUs]] running [[Android (operating system)|Android]] or [[Linux]]. It is used to research and develop [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer network]]s. The project supports the [[PlayStation 3]].

[[Image:Oproject climate sst 1461.png|thumb|right|Map of sea surface temperature of 1 January 1982 generated by OProject@Home.]]
The Weird Engine subproject calculates the [[weird number]]s {{OEIS|id=A006037}}. Numbers are available in the project database. According to the OEIS it is the largest publicly available database of such numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A006037|title=Weird numbers: abundant (A005101) but not pseudoperfect (A005835)|website=On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|date=October 21, 2001|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ongoing work on the application analyzing status of water on Earth. OProject@Home uses data from [[NASA]] and [[NOAA]] [[satellite]]s. Analyzed data are taken from devices [[Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer|AVHRR]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|AMSR]] that are used to measure the Earth's [[radiation]] predominantly in the [[infrared]]. Based on the information is easy to calculate the [[sea surface temperature]] and [[Sea ice concentration|ice concentration]] at any point on Earth. This information will enable to perform the analysis and simulations climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=European plant phenology and climate as seen in a 20-year AVHRR land-surface parameter dataset |authorlink= R. Stöckli and P. L. Vidale |date=May 26, 2003 |publisher=International Journal of Remote Sensing, Volume 25, Issue 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), NASDA's contribution to the EOS for global energy and water cycle studies |authorlink= T.

Spencer |date=February 2003 |publisher=Journals &amp; Magazines, Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Volume: 41, Issue: 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subprojects running on the platform OProject@Home are important to science because they address difficult and unsolved problems in physics and theoretical mathematics. For example, [[Goldbach's conjecture]], proposed in 1742 has never been disproven. It is not even clear whether the problem can be solved, as the range of numbers are infinite. It's also not known if there are any [[Parity (mathematics)|odd]] weird numbers. All calculated weird numbers are [[Parity (mathematics)|even]]. Climate change and global warming has also raised a number of controversies, and a future goal is to effectively analyze the entire Earth to predict the probability of various possible threats to people. Such systems can warn against natural disasters such as [[hurricanes]] or [[cyclones]] that may arise in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Impact of the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit measurements on hurricane prediction |authorlink= Tong Zhu, Da-Lin Zhang and Fuzhong Weng |year=2002 |publisher=Mon. Wea. Rev., 130, 2416–2432.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Impacts of Ocean–Atmosphere Coupling on Tropical Cyclone Intensity Change and Ocean Prediction in the Australian Region |authorlink= P. A. Sandery, G. B. Brassington, A. Craig and T. Pugh |year=2010 |publisher=Mon. Wea. Rev., 138, 2074–2091.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is a future development, a sample video showing the sea surface temperature for 1982 has been generated in order to show what this can result in. The simulation is based on publicly available databases from organisations such as [[NOAA]] and [[NASA]].

As with most other [[volunteer computing|volunteer computing projects]], progress relies on recruiting a number of users willing to donate computing power to the project. These projects are usually run in the background and when the computer is idle and have little or no performance impact when a person is using the computer.

A side effect of the project is to develop high-performance algorithms for the various subprojects. The source code of the programs are open and available for public download on [[Google Code]], licensed under the [[GPL]] license. All the data generated by the project is also available from the project website, also distributed under the GPL license. The project is also open to new subprojects, although the current focus is on the continued development of the software, in order to ensure a more stable platform.

The project was officially launched on 13 August 2012. As of 9 October 2012, over 2243 volunteers with over 1779 hosts have participated in the project.&lt;ref&gt;OProject@Home, Project Stats box&lt;/ref&gt; The Oproject has 9th place between all BOINC projects by the amount of new hosts after well-known [[World Community Grid|WCG]], [[SETI@Home]], MilkyWay, [[Collatz conjecture]], [[PrimeGrid]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boincstats.com/en/stats/projectStatsInfo |title=Project stats info |publisher=boincstats.com |accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, 2012 the project lead released the news about the launch OProject@Home in BOINC official website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oeis.org/A006037 |title=OProject@Home launches |authorlink=David Anderson |date=September 30, 2012 |publisher=boinc.berkeley.edu |accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later on the same day the project was added to the overall list of distributed systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19697">{{short description| Pressure attributed to a component gas in a mixture }}
In a mixture of [[gas]]es, each constituent gas has a '''partial pressure''' which is the notional [[pressure]] of that constituent gas if it alone occupied the entire [[volume]] of the original mixture at the same [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Henrickson|title=Chemistry|edition=|publisher=Cliffs Notes|year=2005|isbn=0-7645-7419-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total pressure of an [[ideal gas]] mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture.

The partial pressure of a gas is a measure of thermodynamic activity of the gas's [[molecule]]s.  Gases dissolve, diffuse, and react according to their partial pressures, and not according to their [[concentration]]s in gas mixtures or liquids. This general property of gases is also true in chemical reactions of gases in biology. For example, the necessary amount of oxygen for human respiration, and the amount that is toxic, is set by the partial pressure of oxygen alone. This is true across a very wide range of different concentrations of oxygen present in various inhaled breathing gases or dissolved in blood.{{clarify|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-biology2/chapter/gas-pressure-and-respiration/|title=Gas Pressure and Respiration|last=|first=|date=|website=Lumen Learning|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are important parameters in tests of [[arterial blood gas]]es, but can also be measured in, for example, [[cerebrospinal fluid]].

The symbol for pressure is usually P or p which may use a subscript to identify the pressure, and gas species are also referred to by subscript.

:&lt;math&gt;{P_{v_{O_2}}}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;{p_{v_{O_2}}}&lt;/math&gt; = venous partial pressure of oxygen

==Dalton's law of partial pressures==
{{main|Dalton's law}}

Dalton's law expresses the fact that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases in the mixture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chm.davidson.edu/vce/gaslaws/daltonslaw.html Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures]&lt;/ref&gt; This equality arises from the fact that in an ideal gas the molecules are so far apart that they do not interact with each other. Most actual real-world gases come very close to this ideal. For example, given an ideal gas mixture of [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and  [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;):

:&lt;math chem&gt;p = p_\ce{N2} + p_\ce{H2} + p_\ce{NH3}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;p \,&lt;/math&gt;  
|align=left|= total pressure of the gas mixture
|-
!align=right|&lt;math chem&gt;p_\ce{N2}&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= partial pressure of nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
|-
!align=right|&lt;math chem&gt;p_\ce{H2}&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= partial pressure of hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
|-
!align=right|&lt;math chem&gt;p_\ce{NH3}&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= partial pressure of ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)
|}

==Ideal gas mixtures==
Ideally the ratio of partial pressures equals the ratio of the number of molecules. That is, the [[mole fraction]] of an individual gas component in an [[ideal gas]] [[mixture]] can be expressed in terms of the component's partial pressure or the [[mole (unit)|moles]] of the component:
:&lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{i}} = \frac{p_{\mathrm{i}}}{p} = \frac{n_{\mathrm{i}}}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

and the partial pressure of an individual gas component in an ideal gas can be obtained using this expression:
:&lt;math&gt;p_{\mathrm{i}} = x_{\mathrm{i}} \cdot p&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{i}}&lt;/math&gt;  
|align=left|= mole fraction of any individual gas component in a gas mixture
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;p_{\mathrm{i}}&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= partial pressure of any individual gas component in a gas mixture
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;n_{\mathrm{i}}&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= moles of any individual gas component in a gas mixture
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= total moles of the gas mixture
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= total pressure of the gas mixture
|}

The mole fraction of a gas component in a gas mixture is equal to the volumetric fraction of that component in a gas mixture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/gases/ Frostberg State University's "General Chemistry Online"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio of partial pressures relies on the following isotherm relation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_x}{V_{tot}} = \frac{p_x}{p_{tot}} = \frac{n_x}{n_{tot}}&lt;/math&gt;
:* ''V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the partial volume of any individual gas component (X)
:* ''V&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the total volume of the gas mixture
:* ''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the '''partial pressure''' of gas X
:* ''p&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the total pressure of the gas mixture 
:* ''n&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[amount of substance]] of gas (X)
:* ''n&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the total amount of substance in gas mixture

==Partial volume (Amagat's law of additive volume)==
The partial volume of a particular gas in a mixture is the volume of one component of the gas mixture. It is useful in gas mixtures, e.g. air, to focus on one particular gas component, e.g. oxygen.

It can be approximated both from partial pressure and molar fraction:&lt;ref name=biophysics200&gt;Page 200 in: Medical biophysics. Flemming Cornelius. 6th Edition, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_x = V_{tot} \times \frac{p_x}{p_{tot}} = V_{tot} \times \frac{n_x}{n_{tot}}&lt;/math&gt;
:* ''V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the partial volume of an individual gas component X in the mixture
:* ''V&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the total volume of the gas mixture
:* ''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the partial pressure of gas X
:* ''p&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the total pressure of the gas mixture
:* ''n&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[amount of substance]] of gas X
:* ''n&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the total amount of substance in the gas mixture

==Vapor pressure==
{{main|Vapor pressure}}
[[Image:vapor_pressure_chart.svg|thumb|right|A log-lin vapor pressure chart for various liquids]]

[[Vapor pressure]] is the pressure of a [[vapor]] in equilibrium with its non-vapor phases (i.e., liquid or solid). Most often the term is used to describe a [[liquid]]'s tendency to [[evaporate]].  It is a measure of the tendency of [[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s to escape from a liquid or a [[solid]]. A liquid's atmospheric pressure boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure and it is often called the '''[[normal boiling point]]'''.

The higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature, the lower the normal boiling point of the liquid.

The vapor pressure chart displayed has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W. (Editors)|title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1997|isbn= 0-07-049841-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As can be seen in the chart, the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points.

For example, at any given temperature, [[methyl chloride]] has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (-24.2&amp;nbsp;°C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere ([[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]) of absolute vapor pressure. Note that at higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is less than that at sea level, so boiling points of liquids are reduced. At the top of [[Mount Everest]], the atmospheric pressure is approximately 0.333 atm, so by using the graph, the boiling point of [[Diethyl ether]] would be approximately 7.5&amp;nbsp;°C versus 34.6&amp;nbsp;°C at sea level (1 atm).

==Equilibrium constants of reactions involving gas mixtures==
It is possible to work out the [[equilibrium constant]] for a chemical reaction involving a mixture of gases given the partial pressure of each gas and the overall reaction formula. For a reversible reaction involving gas reactants and gas products, such as:
:&lt;math&gt;a\,A + b\,B \leftrightarrow c\,C + d\,D&lt;/math&gt;

the equilibrium constant of the reaction would be:
:&lt;math&gt;K_p = \frac{p_C^c\, p_D^d} {p_A^a\, p_B^b}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= &amp;nbsp;the equilibrium constant of the reaction
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;  
|align=left|= &amp;nbsp;coefficient of reactant &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= &amp;nbsp;coefficient of reactant &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;  
|align=left|= &amp;nbsp;coefficient of product &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= &amp;nbsp;coefficient of product &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;p_C^c&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= &amp;nbsp;the partial pressure of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; raised to the power of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;p_D^d&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= &amp;nbsp;the partial pressure of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; raised to the power of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;p_A^a&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= &amp;nbsp;the partial pressure of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; raised to the power of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;p_B^b&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= &amp;nbsp;the partial pressure of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; raised to the power of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
|}

For reversible reactions, changes in the total pressure, temperature or reactant concentrations will shift the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] so as to favor either the right or left side of the reaction in accordance with [[Le Chatelier's Principle]]. However, the [[Chemical kinetics|reaction kinetics]] may either oppose or enhance the equilibrium shift. In some cases, the reaction kinetics may be the overriding factor to consider.

==Henry's law and the solubility of gases==
{{main|Henry's law}}

Gases will [[solvation|dissolve]] in [[liquid]]s to an extent that is determined by the equilibrium between the undissolved gas and the gas that has dissolved in the liquid (called the ''[[solvent]]'').&lt;ref name=RolfeSander&gt;[http://www.henrys-law.org An extensive list of Henry's law constants, and a conversion tool]&lt;/ref&gt; The equilibrium constant for that equilibrium is:

:(1) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;k = \frac {p_x}{C_x}&lt;/math&gt;

:{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= &amp;nbsp;the equilibrium constant for the [[solvation]] process
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= &amp;nbsp;partial pressure of gas &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in equilibrium with a [[solution]] containing some of the gas 
|-
!align=right|&lt;math&gt;C_x&lt;/math&gt;
|align=left|= &amp;nbsp;the concentration of gas &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the liquid solution
|}

The form of the equilibrium constant shows that '''the concentration of a [[solution|solute]] gas in a solution is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the solution'''. This statement is known as [[Henry's law]] and the equilibrium constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is quite often referred to as the Henry's law constant.&lt;ref name=RolfeSander/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Francis L. Smith  |author2=Allan H. Harvey  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=September 2007 |title=Avoid Common Pitfalls When Using Henry's Law |journal=CEP (Chemical Engineering Progress) |volume= |issue= |pages= |issn=0360-7275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwb4.unl.edu/Chem/CHEM869J/CHEM869JLinks/www.chem.ualberta.ca/courses/plambeck/p101/p01182.htm Introductory University Chemistry, Henry's Law and the Solubility of Gases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504234140/http://dwb4.unl.edu/Chem/CHEM869J/CHEM869JLinks/www.chem.ualberta.ca/courses/plambeck/p101/p01182.htm |date=2012-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry's law is sometimes written as:&lt;ref name=UArizona&gt;[http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/103a004/nts004/l41/l41.html University of Arizona chemistry class notes]&lt;/ref&gt;
:(2) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;k' = \frac {C_x}{p_x}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k'&lt;/math&gt; is also referred to as the Henry's law constant.&lt;ref name=UArizona/&gt; As can be seen by comparing equations (1) and (2) above,  &lt;math&gt;k'&lt;/math&gt; is the reciprocal of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Since both may be referred to as the Henry's law constant, readers of the technical literature must be quite careful to note which version of the Henry's law equation is being used.

Henry's law is an approximation that only applies for dilute, ideal solutions and for solutions where the liquid solvent does not [[chemical reaction|react chemically]] with the gas being dissolved.

==In diving breathing gases==
In [[underwater diving]] the physiological effects of individual component gases of [[breathing gas]]es is a function of partial pressure.

Using diving terms, partial pressure is calculated as:
:'''partial pressure = (total absolute pressure) × (volume fraction of gas component)'''

For the component gas "i":
:'''pp&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = P × F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''

For example, at {{convert|50|m|ft|0}} underwater, the total absolute pressure is {{convert|6|bar|kPa|abbr=on}} (i.e., 1 bar of [[atmospheric pressure]] + 5 bar of water pressure) and the partial pressures of the main components of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], [[oxygen]] 21% by volume and [[nitrogen]] approximately 79% by volume are:
:'''ppN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' = 6 bar × 0.79 = 4.7 bar absolute
:'''ppO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' = 6 bar × 0.21 = 1.3 bar absolute

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right|pp&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;  
|align=left|= partial pressure of gas component i &amp;nbsp;= &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{i}}&lt;/math&gt; in the terms used in this article
|-
!align=right|P
|align=left|= total pressure = &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in the terms used in this article
|-
!align=right|F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; 
|align=left|= volume fraction of gas component i &amp;nbsp;= &amp;nbsp;mole fraction, &lt;math&gt;x_{\mathrm{i}}&lt;/math&gt;, in the terms used in this article
|-
!align=right|ppN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|align=left|= partial pressure of nitrogen&amp;nbsp; = &lt;math&gt;P_{{\mathrm{N}}_2}&lt;/math&gt; in the terms used in this article
|-
!align=right|ppO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
|align=left|= partial pressure of oxygen&amp;nbsp; = &lt;math&gt;P_{{\mathrm{O}}_2}&lt;/math&gt; in the terms used in this article
|}

The minimum safe lower limit for the partial pressures of oxygen in a gas mixture is {{convert|0.16|bar|kPa}} absolute. [[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] and sudden unconsciousness becomes a problem with an oxygen partial pressure of less than 0.16 bar absolute.  [[Oxygen toxicity]], involving convulsions, becomes a problem when oxygen partial pressure is too high.  The [[NOAA]] Diving Manual recommends a maximum single exposure of 45 minutes at 1.6 bar absolute, of 120 minutes at 1.5 bar absolute, of 150 minutes at 1.4 bar absolute, of 180 minutes at 1.3 bar absolute and of 210 minutes at 1.2 bar absolute. Oxygen toxicity becomes a risk when these oxygen partial pressures and exposures are exceeded. The partial pressure of oxygen determines the [[maximum operating depth]] of a gas mixture.

[[Nitrogen narcosis|Narcosis]] is a problem when breathing gases at high pressure. Typically, the maximum total partial pressure of narcotic gases used when planning for [[technical diving]] may be around 4.5&amp;nbsp;bar absolute, based on an [[equivalent narcotic depth]] of {{convert|35|m|ft}}.

The effect of a toxic contaminant such as [[carbon monoxide]] in breathing gas is also related to the partial pressure when breathed. A mixture which may be relatively safe at the surface could be dangerously toxic at the maximum depth of a dive, or a tolerable level of [[carbon dioxide]] in the breathing loop of a diving [[rebreather]] may be come intolerable within seconds during descent when the partial pressure rapidly increases, and could lead to panic or incapacitation of the diver.

==In medicine==
The partial pressures of particularly oxygen (&lt;math&gt;p_{{\mathrm{O}}_2}&lt;/math&gt;) and carbon dioxide (&lt;math&gt;p_{{\mathrm{CO}}_2}&lt;/math&gt;) are important parameters in tests of [[arterial blood gas]]es, but can also be measured in, for example, [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. {{why?|date=October 2018}}

On October 11, 1958, '''''Pioneer 1''''' became the first [[spacecraft]] launched by [[NASA]], the newly formed space agency of the [[United States]]. The flight was the second and most successful of the three [[Thor-Able]] space probes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1958-007A |title=Pioneer 1 - NSSDC ID: 1958-007A |publisher=NASA NSSDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spacecraft design ==
[[File:Pioneer I on the Launch Pad - GPN-2002-000204.jpg|thumb|''Pioneer 1'' atop its launcher]]
''Pioneer 1'' was fabricated by Ramo-Wooldridge Corp.([[TRW Inc.|TRW]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdfo.org/stl/Pioneer%20Part%20II.pdf "Pioneering Space”]&lt;/ref&gt; and consisted of a thin cylindrical midsection with a squat truncated cone on each side. The cylinder was {{convert|74|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter and the height from the top of one cone to the top of the opposite cone was {{convert|76|cm|0|abbr=on}}. Along the axis of the spacecraft and protruding from the end of the lower cone was an 11&amp;nbsp;kg solid propellant injection rocket and rocket case, which formed the main structural member of the spacecraft. Eight small low-thrust [[Solid-propellant rocket|solid propellant]] velocity adjustment rockets were mounted on the end of the upper cone in a ring assembly which could be jettisoned after use. A magnetic [[dipole antenna]] also protruded from the top of the upper cone. The shell was composed of laminated plastic. The total mass of the spacecraft after vernier separation was 34.2&amp;nbsp;kg, after injection rocket firing it would have been 23.2&amp;nbsp;kg.

The three-stage Thor-Able vehicle consisted of a modified Air Force Thor IRBM (liquid propellant, thrust about 153,000 pounds) as the first stage. A [[liquid-propellant rocket]] engine powered the second stage (modified Vanguard second stage, thrust about 7500 pounds). The third stage was a solid-propellant unit based on Vanguard design, rated at 116,500&amp;nbsp;lb*sec total impulse.&lt;ref name=NTRS&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenthal|first=Alfred|title=A record of NASA space missions since 1958|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19940003358|work=NASA|publisher=NASA Technical Reports Server|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific instrument package had a mass of 17.8&amp;nbsp;kg and consisted of an image scanning infrared television system to study the [[Moon]]'s surface to a resolution of 0.5 degrees, an [[ionization chamber]] to measure radiation in space, a diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect [[micrometeoroid|micrometeorites]], a spin-coil [[magnetometer]] to measure magnetic fields to 5 microgauss, and temperature-variable [[resistor]]s to record the spacecraft's internal conditions. The spacecraft was powered by [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]] for ignition of the rockets, [[silver-oxide battery|silver cell batteries]] for the television system, and [[mercury battery|mercury batteries]] for the remaining circuits. Radio transmission was on 108.06&amp;nbsp;MHz through an electric dipole antenna for telemetry and doppler information at 300&amp;nbsp;mW and a magnetic dipole antenna for the television system at 50 W. Ground commands were received through the electric dipole antenna at 115&amp;nbsp;MHz. The spacecraft was [[spin-stabilized satellite|spin-stabilized]] at 1.8 rps, the spin direction was approximately perpendicular to the geomagnetic meridian planes of the trajectory.

== Mission ==
Two days after the failure of ''Pioneer 0'' on August 17, Thor 129, the backup vehicle, was erected on LC-17B in preparation for a September attempt. The postflight investigation of ''Pioneer 0'' pointed to a turbopump failure, which had also caused the loss of Thor-Able 116 in April. This was followed by the failure of an Atlas launch on September 18, so the Air Force moved to replace the turbopumps in their inventory of Thor and Atlas missiles. Thor 129 was pulled from the pad for modifications and replaced with Thor 130. On October 11, ''Pioneer 1'' lifted off smoothly, but the guidance system steered the Thor slightly too high and fast, causing the second stage to be lofted 3° higher than intended. As a result, it shut off 10 seconds earlier than planned, and also bumped the third stage during separation. The third stage was left pitched up about 15° and suffering a velocity shortfall of about  500 feet per second. The vernier engines on the third stage were fired to make up for the thrust deficit, but added only 150 feet per second of velocity, insufficient to escape Earth orbit. As a last resort, ground controllers decided that if they could not get ''Pioneer 1'' to the Moon, they would place it in a high Earth orbit by firing the attached solid rocket motor. The inaccurate launch trajectory, however, had placed the probe on an orbital track that resulted in thermal heating and cooling beyond what the primitive temperature control system could handle. The probe's internals fell to near freezing temperatures, rendering the solid motor igniter inoperable. Pioneer 1 reached a total distance of {{convert|71,100|miles}} before beginning its descent back to Earth.&lt;ref name="ppg581013"/&gt;

The spacecraft was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|LC-17A]] at 08:42:00 UTC on October 11, 1958 but it did not reach the Moon as planned due to a programming error in the upper stage causing a slight error in burnout velocity and angle (3.5 deg.). This resulted in a ballistic trajectory with a peak altitude of {{convert|113800|km|0|abbr=on}} around 13:00 local time. The real-time transmission was obtained for about 75% of the flight, but the percentage of data recorded for each experiment was variable. Except for the first hour of flight, the signal-to-noise ratio was good. The spacecraft ended transmission when it reentered the Earth's atmosphere after 43 hours of flight on October 13, 1958 at 03:46 UT over the South [[Pacific Ocean]]. A small quantity of useful scientific information was returned, showing the radiation surrounding Earth was in the form of bands and measuring the extent of the bands, mapping the total ionizing flux, making the first observations of hydromagnetic oscillations of the [[magnetic field]], and taking the first measurements of the density of micrometeorites and the [[Interplanetary Magnetic Field]].

'''''Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society''''' ({{ISBN|0-674-79291-2}}) is an influential book by [[Bruno Latour]]. The English edition was published in 1987 by [[Harvard University Press]]. It is written in a textbook style, and contains a full-featured approach to the empirical study of science and technology. Moreover, it also entertains ontological conceptions and theoretical discussions making it a research monograph and not a methodological handbook per se.

In the first chapter Latour develops the methodological dictum that science and technology must be studied "in action", or "in the making". Because scientific discoveries turn esoteric and difficult to understand, it has to be studied where discoveries are made in practice. For example, Latour turns back time in the case of the discovery of the "double helix". Going back in time, deconstructing statements, machines and articles, it is possible to arrive at a point where scientific discovery could have chosen to take many other directions (contingency). Also the concept of "black box" is introduced. A black box is a metaphor borrowed from cybernetics denoting a piece of machinery that "runs by itself". That is, when a series of instructions are too complicated to be repeated all the time, a black box is drawn around it, allowing it to function only by giving it "input" and "output" data. For example, a CPU inside a computer is a black box. Its inner complexity doesn't have to be known; one only needs to use it in his/her daily activities.
&lt;!-- To do: Summarize the following chapters in science in action. --&gt;

==Criticism==
Latour's work, including ''Science in Action'', has received heavy criticism from some scholars.  Olga Amsterdamska's highly critical book review concluded with the following sentence: "Somehow, the ideal of a social science whose only goal is to tell inconsistent, false, and incoherent stories about nothing in particular does not strike me as very appealing or sufficiently ambitious."&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdamska, Olga.  Surely You Are Joking, Monsieur Latour!  Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values, Vol. 15 No. 4, Fall 1990 495-504.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7332">'''Second Generation Multiplex Plus (SGM Plus)''', is a [[DNA profiling]] system developed by [[Applied Biosystems]]. It is an updated version of [[Second Generation Multiplex]]. SGM Plus has been used by the [[UK National DNA Database]] since 1998.

An SGM Plus profile consists of a list of 10 number pairs, one number pair for each of 10 [[genetic marker]]s, along with two letters (XX or XY) which show the result of the gender test. Each number pair denotes the two [[allele]] values for the marker - one value is inherited from each of the subject's parents. If both alleles are the same, then only a single number, rather than a pair, is recorded.

==Genetic Markers==

The genetic markers (or [[genetic locus|loci]]) used by SGM Plus are all [[Short tandem repeat]]s (STRs). The markers used are: VWA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, TH01, FGA, D3S1358, D16S539, D2S1338 and D19S433. Where a marker's designation begins with D, the digits immediately following the D indicate the [[chromosome]] that contains the marker. For example, D21S11 is on [[Chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome 21]]. SGM Plus also uses the [[Amelogenin]] (Amelo) sex-indicating test.

SGM Plus differs from SGM in that SGM does not use the markers D3S1358, D16S539, D2S1338 and D19S433.

SGM Plus has eight markers in common with [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]] FGA, TH01, VWA, D3S1358, D8S1179, D16S539, D18S51, and D21S11. It differs from CODIS in that it uses the additional markers D2S1338 and D19S433 and does not use the five markers CSF1PO, TPOX, D5S818, D7S820, D13S317.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cstl.nist.gov/strbase/pub_pres/Butler2006JFS_coreSTRreview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dye tags==
The primers are tagged with the following fluorescent dyes for detection under electrophoresis:

*5-FAM
*JOE
*NED

The primers for each locus are arranged on the dyes in the following order, from low molecular weight to large molecular weight:

*5-FAM: D3, VWA, D16, D2
*JOE: Amelo, D8, D21, D18
*NED: D19, THO, FGA

The dyes to which each primer is attached differ from those of the original SGM DNA profiling system.

==Example SGM Plus profile==

An SGM Plus profile retrieved from a DNA database would just list the allele values:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npia.police.uk/en/13340.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303092347/http://www.npia.police.uk/en/13340.htm |archivedate=2010-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each value is the number of [[tandem repeat]]s within the allele. A non-standard repeat is designated by the number of complete repeat units and the number of base pairs of the partial repeat, separated by a decimal point.

==Probability of Identity==

The probability of identify (also known as the random match probability) is the probability that two individuals selected at random will have an identical genetic profile.

Applied Biosystems estimates the probability of identity for SGM Plus to be approximately 1 in 13 trillion for African-Americans and 1 in 3.3 trillion Caucasian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual|title=AmpFlSTR SGM Plus PCR Amplification Kit User’s Manual|pages=14–12|url=http://www3.appliedbiosystems.com/cms/groups/applied_markets_support/documents/generaldocuments/cms_041049.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Genetics Commission]] has reported that the random match probability is in the region of 1 in a trillion. However it stated "When the SGM Plus profiling system was first introduced, there was agreement within the scientific community that identifications with match probabilities lower than one in a billion would not be quoted in the courts of law, so as to avoid overstating the value of the DNA evidence to take into account that match probabilities are only estimates, and to make sure that the figure used was one that was meaningful to non-specialists."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report
|title=Nothing to hide, nothing to fear? p.49
|author=Human Genetics Commission
|url=http://www.hgc.gov.uk/UploadDocs/DocPub/Document/Nothing%20to%20hide,%20nothing%20to%20fear%20-%20online%20version.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[Crown Prosecution Service]] states "SGM Plus DNA profiling is very discriminating between individuals. The probability of obtaining a match between the profiles of two unrelated individuals by chance is very low, of the order of 1 in a billion [note this is a UK [[1,000,000,000,000 (number)|billion]], ie a US trillion]. However, it has not yet been possible to carry out the required statistical testing to be able to quote this match probability, and in practice a more conservative chance match figure of 1 in 1,000 million is used."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/scientific_evidence/adventitious_dna_matches/|title=B4.

'''Shenzhou 2''' ({{zh|c=神舟二号}}) launched on January 9, 2001, was the second unmanned launch of the [[Shenzhou spacecraft]]. Inside the reentry capsule were a [[monkey]], a [[dog]] and a [[rabbit]] in a test of the spaceship's [[life support]] systems. The reentry module separated from the rest of the spacecraft after just over seven days in orbit, with the orbital module staying in orbit for another 220 days.

''Shenzhou 2'' tested the spacecraft much more rigorously than its predecessor ''[[Shenzhou 1]]''. After being launched into a 196.5 by 333.8&amp;nbsp;km orbit, 20.5 hours after launch it circularised its orbit to 327.7 by 332.7&amp;nbsp;km. Around 1220 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on January 12 it once again changed its orbit to 329.3 by 339.4&amp;nbsp;km. A third orbit change came on January 15 328.7 by 345.4&amp;nbsp;km.

As well as the animal cargo, there were 64 different scientific payloads. 15 were carried in the reentry module, 12 in the orbital module and 37 on the forward external pallet. These included a [[Weightlessness|microgravity]] [[crystallography]] experiment; animal species including six [[mouse|mice]], and small aquatic and terrestrial organisms; [[cosmic ray]] and particle detectors and a [[gamma ray burst]] detectors. To test the radio transmitting systems taped messages were broadcast from the spacecraft.

The signal for retrofire was sent at about 1015 UTC on January 16 as the spacecraft passed over the South Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Africa. It landed in Inner Mongolia at 11:22 UTC. No photos were released of the landing capsule leading to some speculation that the reentry was not completely successful, though this was denied by Chinese officials. The [[Swedish Space Center]] news site reported that an unnamed source said one of the connections from the capsule to the single parachute failed leading to a hard landing.

The mission of the orbital module continued until it was commanded to fire its rockets to initiate reentry on August 24. It reentered over the western Pacific Ocean between [[Easter Island]] and [[Chile]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7836">This is compilation of published '''[[detonation]] velocities''' for various high explosive compounds. Detonation velocity is the speed with which the detonation shock wave travels through the explosive. It is a key, directly measurable indicator of explosive performance, but depends on density which must always be specified, and may be too low if the test charge diameter is not large enough. Especially for little studied explosives there may be divergent published values due to charge diameter issues. In liquid explosives, like nitroglycerin, there may be two detonation velocities, one much higher than the other. The detonation velocity values presented here are typically for the highest practical density which maximizes achievable detonation velocity.&lt;ref name="Cooper1996"&gt;Cooper, Paul W. (1996). ''Explosives Engineering'', New York: Wiley-VCH.  {{ISBN|0-471-18636-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The velocity of detonation is an important indicator for overall energy and power of detonation, and in particular for the [[brisance]] or shattering effect of an explosive which is due to the detonation pressure. The pressure can be calculated using Chapman-Jouguet theory from the velocity and density.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16936">A '''twin prime''' is a [[prime number]] that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime number—for example, either member of the twin prime pair (41, 43). In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a [[prime gap]] of two. Sometimes the term ''twin prime'' is used for a pair of twin primes; an alternative name for this is '''prime twin''' or '''prime pair'''.

Twin primes become increasingly rare as one examines larger ranges, in keeping with the general tendency of gaps between adjacent primes to become larger as the numbers themselves get larger.  However, it is unknown if there are infinitely many twin primes or if there is a largest pair. The work of [[Yitang Zhang]] in 2013, as well as work by [[James Maynard (mathematician)|James Maynard]], [[Terence Tao]] and others, has made substantial progress towards proving that there are infinitely many twin primes, but at present it remains unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Tao, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp06oGD4m00&amp;t=425 Small and Large Gaps Between the Primes]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{unsolved|mathematics|Are there infinitely many twin primes?}}

==History==
The question of whether there exist infinitely many twin primes has been one of the great open questions in [[number theory]] for many years. This is the content of the '''twin prime conjecture''', which states that there are infinitely many primes ''p'' such that ''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 is also prime. In 1849, [[Alphonse de Polignac|de Polignac]] made the more general conjecture that for every [[natural number]] ''k'', there are infinitely many primes ''p'' such that ''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''k'' is also prime. The case&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 of [[de Polignac's conjecture]] is the twin prime conjecture.

A stronger form of the twin prime conjecture, the Hardy–Littlewood conjecture (see below), postulates a distribution law for twin primes akin to the [[prime number theorem]].

On April 17, 2013, [[Yitang Zhang]] announced a proof that for some integer ''N'' that is less than 70 million, there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by&amp;nbsp;''N''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKee|first=Maggie|title=First proof that infinitely many prime numbers come in pairs|journal=Nature|date=14 May 2013|url=http://www.nature.com/news/first-proof-that-infinitely-many-prime-numbers-come-in-pairs-1.12989|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.12989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang's paper was accepted by ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' in early May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Bounded gaps between primes | first = Yitang | last = Zhang | journal = [[Annals of Mathematics]] | year=2014 | volume=179 | issue=3 | pages=1121–1174 | doi=10.4007/annals.2014.179.3.7  | mr=3171761 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terence Tao]] subsequently proposed a [[Polymath Project]] collaborative effort to optimize Zhang's bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tao|first=Terence|authorlink=Terence Tao|url=http://polymathprojects.org/2013/06/04/polymath-proposal-bounded-gaps-between-primes/|title=Polymath proposal: bounded gaps between primes|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of April 14, 2014, one year after Zhang's announcement, the bound has been reduced to 246.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Bounded_gaps_between_primes|title=Bounded gaps between primes|publisher=Polymath|accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, assuming the [[Elliott–Halberstam conjecture]] and its generalized form, the Polymath project wiki states that the bound has been reduced to 12 and 6, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These improved bounds were discovered using a different approach that was simpler than Zhang's and was discovered independently by James Maynard and Terence Tao. This second approach also gave bounds for the smallest ''f''(''m'') needed to guarantee that infinitely many intervals of width ''f''(''m'') contain at least ''m'' primes.

==Properties==
Usually the pair (2, 3) is not considered to be a pair of twin primes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/100ktwins.txt The First 100,000 Twin Primes]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2 is the only even prime, this pair is the only pair of prime numbers that differ by one; thus twin primes are as closely spaced as possible for any other two primes.

The first few twin prime pairs are:
:(3,  5), (5,  7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31), (41, 43), (59, 61), (71, 73),  (101, 103), (107, 109), (137, 139), … {{OEIS2C|id=A077800}}.

Five is the only prime in two distinct pairs.

Every twin prime pair except &lt;math&gt;(3, 5)&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;(6n-1, 6n+1)&lt;/math&gt; for some [[natural number]] ''n''; that is, the number between the two primes is a multiple of 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://primes.utm.edu/notes/faq/six.html | title=Are all primes (past 2 and 3) of the forms 6n+1 and 6n-1? | last=Caldwell | first=Chris K. | website=The Prime Pages | publisher=The University of Tennessee at Martin | access-date=2018-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the sum of any pair of twin primes (other than 3 and 5) is divisible by 12.

===Brun's theorem===
{{Main|Brun's theorem}}
In 1915, [[Viggo Brun]] showed that the sum of reciprocals of the twin primes was convergent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | jfm=45.0330.16 | last=Brun | first=V. | authorlink=Viggo Brun | title=Über das Goldbachsche Gesetz und die Anzahl der Primzahlpaare | language=German | journal=Archiv for Mathematik og Naturvidenskab| volume=34 | number=8 | pages=3–19 | year=1915 | issn=0365-4524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This famous result, called [[Brun's theorem]], was the first use of the [[Brun sieve]] and helped initiate the development of modern [[sieve theory]].  The modern version of Brun's argument can be used to show that the number of twin primes less than ''N'' does not exceed

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{CN}{(\log N)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

for some absolute constant ''C''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;ref name=BD313&gt;Bateman &amp; Diamond (2004) p.&amp;nbsp;313&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is bounded above by :&lt;math&gt;\frac{C'N}{(\log N)^2}\left(1 + O\left(\frac{\log \log N}{\log N}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C' = 8C_2&lt;/math&gt;, where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the '''twin prime constant''', given [[#First Hardy–Littlewood conjecture|below]].&lt;ref&gt;Heini Halberstam, and Hans-Egon Richert, ''Sieve Methods'', p.&amp;nbsp;117, Dover Publications, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other theorems weaker than the twin prime conjecture==
In 1940, [[Paul Erdős]] showed that there is a [[Mathematical constant|constant]] ''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and infinitely many primes ''p'' such that {{nowrap|(''p''′&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;(''c''&amp;nbsp;ln&amp;nbsp;''p'')}} where ''p''′ denotes the next prime after&amp;nbsp;''p''. This result was successively improved; in 1986 [[Helmut Maier]] showed that a constant ''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.25 can be used.  In 2004 [[Daniel Goldston]] and [[Cem Yıldırım]] showed that the constant could be improved further to ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.085786…  In 2005, Goldston, [[János Pintz]] and Yıldırım established that ''c'' can be chosen to be arbitrarily small,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}\frac{p_{n+1}-p_n}{\log p_n}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

By assuming the [[Elliott–Halberstam conjecture]] or a slightly weaker version, they were able to show that there are infinitely many ''n'' such that at least two of ''n'', ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2, ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6, ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;8, ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;12, ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;18, or ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;20 are prime.  Under a stronger hypothesis they showed that for infinitely many ''n'', at least two of&amp;nbsp;''n'', ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2, ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4, and ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6 are prime.

The result of [[Yitang Zhang]],

:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty}(p_{n+1}-p_n)&lt;N\;\text{ with }\;N=7\times10^7,&lt;/math&gt;

is a major improvement on the Goldston–Graham–Pintz–Yıldırım result. The [[Polymath Project]] optimization of Zhang's bound and the work of Maynard has reduced the bound to ''N'' = 246.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Conjectures==

===First Hardy–Littlewood conjecture===
&lt;!-- [[Hardy–Littlewood conjecture]] redirects here--&gt;

The '''Hardy–Littlewood conjecture''' (named after [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[John Edensor Littlewood|John Littlewood]]) is a generalization of the twin prime conjecture.  It is concerned with the distribution of [[prime constellation]]s, including twin primes, in analogy to the [[prime number theorem]]. Let π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') denote the number of primes ''p'' ≤ ''x'' such that ''p'' + 2 is also prime. Define the '''twin prime constant''' ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OEIS|1=A001692|2=Number of irreducible polynomials of degree n over GF(5); dimensions of free Lie algebras| accessdate = 2011-02-02}} -- A page of number theoretical constants&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_2 = \prod_{\textstyle{p\;{\rm prime}\atop p \ge 3}} \left(1 - \frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) \approx 0.66016 18158 46869 57392 78121 10014\dots&lt;/math&gt;

{{OEIS2C|id=A005597}}
(here the product extends over all prime numbers ''p'' ≥ 3). Then the conjecture is that

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_2(x) \sim 2 C_2 \frac{x}{(\ln x)^2} \sim 2 C_2 \int_2^x {dt \over (\ln t)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

in the sense that the quotient of the two expressions [[limit of a function|tends to]] 1 as ''x'' approaches infinity.&lt;ref name=BD3345&gt;Bateman &amp; Diamond (2004) pp.334–335&lt;/ref&gt;  (The second ~ is not part of the conjecture and is proven by [[integration by parts]].)

The conjecture can be justified (but not proven) by assuming that 1 / ln ''t'' describes the [[density function]] of the prime distribution, an assumption suggested by the prime number theorem and would imply the twin prime conjecture, but remains unresolved.

This first Hardy–Littlewood conjecture on [[prime k-tuple|prime ''k''-tuple]]s implies that the [[second Hardy–Littlewood conjecture|''second'' Hardy–Littlewood conjecture]] is false.

===Polignac's conjecture===
[[Polignac's conjecture]] from 1849 states that for every positive even natural number ''k'', there are infinitely many consecutive prime pairs ''p'' and ''p′'' such that ''p''′&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'' (i.e. there are infinitely many [[prime gap]]s of size&amp;nbsp;''k''). The case ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 is the twin prime conjecture. The conjecture has not yet been proven or disproven for any specific value of&amp;nbsp;''k'', but Zhang's result proves that it is true for at least one (currently unknown) value of ''k''. Indeed, if such a ''k'' did not exist, then for any positive even natural number ''N'' there are at most finitely many ''n'' such that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m'' for all ''m''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' and so for ''n'' large enough we have ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'', which would contradict Zhang's result.

==Large twin primes==
Beginning in 2007, two [[distributed computing]] projects, [[Twin Prime Search]] and [[PrimeGrid]], have produced several record-largest twin primes.  {{As of|2018|9}}, the current largest twin prime pair known is 2996863034895 · 2&lt;sup&gt;1290000&lt;/sup&gt; ± 1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primes.utm.edu/primes/page.php?id=122213|title=The Prime Database: 2996863034895*2^1290000-1|first=Chris K.|last=Caldwell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 388,342 decimal digits.  It was discovered in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=7021|title=World Record Twin Primes Found!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 808,675,888,577,436 twin prime pairs below 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ieeta.pt/~tos/primes.html | title = Tables of values of pi(x) and of pi2(x) | author = Tomás Oliveira e Silva | publisher = [[Aveiro University]] | date = 7 April 2008 | accessdate = 7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An empirical analysis of all prime pairs up to 4.35 · 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; shows that if the number of such pairs less than &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; is f(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;)·&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;/(log &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; then f(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;) is about 1.7 for small &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; and decreases towards about 1.3 as &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; tends to infinity. The limiting value of f(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;) is conjectured to equal twice the twin prime constant ({{OEIS2C|id=A114907}}) (not to be confused with [[Brun's constant]]), according to the Hardy–Littlewood conjecture.

==Other elementary properties==
Every third odd number is divisible by 3, which requires that no three successive odd numbers can be prime unless one of them is 3. Five is therefore the only prime that is part of two twin prime pairs. The lower member of a pair is by definition a [[Chen prime]].

It has been proven that the pair (''m'',&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2) is a twin prime if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;4((m-1)! + 1) \equiv -m \pmod {m(m+2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''m''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4 or ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6 is also prime then the three primes are called a [[prime triplet]].

For a twin prime pair of the form (6''n'' − 1, 6''n'' + 1) for some natural number ''n'' &gt; 1, ''n'' must have units digit 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 8 ({{OEIS2C|id=A002822}}).

==Isolated prime==
An '''isolated prime''' (also known as '''single prime''' or '''non-twin prime''') is a prime number ''p'' such that neither ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2 nor ''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 is prime. In other words, ''p'' is not part of a twin prime pair. For example, 23 is an isolated prime, since 21 and 25 are both [[composite number|composite]].

The first few isolated primes are

:[[2 (number)|2]], [[23 (number)|23]], [[37 (number)|37]], [[47 (number)|47]], [[53 (number)|53]], [[67 (number)|67]], [[79 (number)|79]], [[83 (number)|83]], [[89 (number)|89]], [[97 (number)|97]], ... {{OEIS2C|id=A007510}}

It follows from Brun's theorem that [[almost all]] primes are members of this sequence.

'''''Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions''''' is the debut non-fiction book by [[Lisa Randall]], published in 2005, about [[particle physics]] in general and additional dimensions of space (cf. [[Kaluza–Klein theory]]) in particular. The book has made it to top 50 at [[amazon.com]], making it the world's first successful book on [[theoretical physics]] by a female author.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} She herself characterizes the book as being about physics and the multi-dimensional universe.&lt;ref name=web1/&gt; The book describes, at a non-technical level, theoretical models Professor Randall developed with the physicist Raman Sundrum, in which various aspects of particle physics (e.g. supersymmetry) are explained in a higher-dimensional braneworld scenario. These models have since generated thousands of citations.

==Overview==
She comments that her motivation for writing this book was her "thinking that there were people who wanted a more complete and balanced vision of the current state of physics." She has noticed there is a large audience that thinks [[physics]] is about the bizarre or exotic. She observes that when people develop an understanding of the science of particle physics and the [[Particle accelerator|experiments]] that produce the science, people get excited. "The upcoming experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at CERN near Geneva will test many ideas, including some of the warped extra-dimensional theories I talk about." Another motivation was that she "gambled that there are people who really want to understand the physics and how the many ideas connect."&lt;ref name=web1&gt;{{cite web| author = Randall, Lisa | title = Warped Passages by Lisa Randall | url = http://www.warpedpassages.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704104219/http://www.warpedpassages.com/ |archivedate=4 July 2008 |accessdate  = 29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Randall is currently a professor at [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], focusing on [[particle physics]] and [[cosmology]]. She stays current through her research into the nature of matter's most [[elementary particle|basic elements]], and the forces that govern these most basic elements. Randall's experiences, which qualify her as an authority on the subject of the book, are her original "contributions in a wide variety of physics studies, including [[cosmological inflation]], supersymmetry, [[grand unified theories]], and aspects of [[string theory]]". "As of last autumn, she was the most cited theoretical physicist in the world during the previous five years." In addition  her most recent work involved [[Kaluza–Klein theory|extra dimensions]].&lt;ref name=web2&gt;{{cite web| author = Randall, Lisa |title= Warped Passages by Lisa Randall - about the author| url = http://www.warpedpassages.com/aboutlr.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014203819/http://www.warpedpassages.com/aboutlr.htm |archivedate=14 October 2008 |accessdate = 29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her background research for the book, on the theories and experiments of extra dimensions and warped geometries, was published in the peer-reviewed [[Science (album)|Science magazine]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=SciMag1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Randall|first1=Lisa|authorlink1=Lisa Randall|title=Extra Dimensions and Warped Geometries|journal=Science|date=24 May 2002|volume=296|issue=5572|pages=1422–1427|doi=10.1126/science.1072567|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/296/5572/1422.abstract|jstor=3076748|accessdate=29 June 2015|pmid=12029124|bibcode = 2002Sci...296.1422R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Werner Karl Dahm''' (February 16, 1917 in [[Lindenthal, Cologne|Lindenthal]], Germany – January 17, 2008 in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]) was an [[:Category:Early spaceflight scientists|early spaceflight scientist]] of the [[Peenemünde#Army Research Center Peenemünde|Peenemünde Future Projects Office]] who emigrated to the US under [[Operation Paperclip]] and was the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] Chief Aerodynamicist.

==Life==

Werner Karl Dahm was born on Feb. 16, 1917 in Lindenthal near Köln, Germany, the son of Anton Dahm and Maria Morkramer.  The family moved to Bonn later that year.  His father was the first engineer in a long line of merchants.  After graduating from the Beethoven School in Bonn in 1936, he studied aerodynamics and aircraft design at the [[Technical University in Aachen]], and later in [[Technical University of Munich|Munich]] when the Nazis had closed other technical universities.  In Munich he was one of just four students, out of several hundred, who refused to join the Nazi student club.  He said he first simply pretended not to find it, and then since it was formally listed as a [[Dueling scar|dueling club]] he avoided it by claiming religious objections.  For this he was denied access to certain advanced aircraft courses, so he focused on courses relevant to rocketry.  Before completing his degree he was drafted at the end of 1939, and sent with a [[Signal Corps of the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS|signal corps]] unit to France and then to Czechoslovakia.  In between, he was granted a one-semester break to complete the major part of his aerodynamics degree.

As a result of his technical background, in late 1941 he was assigned to the German rocket development effort at Peenemünde, led by [[Wernher von Braun]].  There, as the youngest member of the rocket team, he worked in the future projects division, a group composed mainly of physicists who needed a specialist in aerodynamics.  At the time, theoretical understanding of high-speed aerodynamics was still in its infancy.  He was one of a group that conducted pioneering experiments in a small [[supersonic wind tunnel]] to obtain essential insights and data to support designs for proposed new rockets.  Among these was the [[Aggregat (rocket family)|A9/A10 rocket]], designed to be the first [[intercontinental ballistic missile]], based on a Mach 6 boost-glide approach using a winged derivative of the V2 rocket.  He soon recognized in the wind tunnel results that a shift occurred in the aerodynamic center-of-pressure as the rocket transitioned to supersonic speeds, which would cause it to become unstable.  This led to experiments and theories to understand the shift and determine aerodynamic configurations that would allow the rocket to remain stable.

He also worked on the [[Wasserfall]] rocket, a radar-guided supersonic anti-aircraft missile, in which the same center-of-pressure shift was being encountered.  Along the way, he developed a conical rocket propellant tank that successfully overcame liquid fuel [[sloshing]] problems, for which he won an internal prize with a monetary award that he proudly never cashed.  In August 1943, when Allied forces bombed the Peenemuende facilities, he received a commendation for saving critical wind tunnel data during the ensuing fires.  The Wasserfall project continued almost to the war's end, and the rocket was successfully flown but never went into production.  In 1944, he and others in the group were granted civilian status, and resumed the A9/A10 development effort.  In January 1945, near the end of the war, two A9 test rockets were launched with control surface designs based on the group's solution to the center-of-pressure shift.  The second of these achieved stable transition to supersonic flight.

Facing advancing Russian forces at the beginning of February 1945, he and most others on the rocket team moved to [[Oberammergau]] to allow a surrender to American forces.  After his release in August 1945, he briefly worked in a candle factory of family friends in Bonn, until accepting an invitation from the U.S. as part of Operation Paperclip to join the U.S. Army's nascent rocket program with other members selected from von Braun's team.  He insisted, however, on first being allowed to finish his degree, which was officially awarded in mechanical engineering due to postwar restrictions on further rocket work in Germany.  In August 1947 he rejoined the other scientists from the von Braun team at [[Fort Bliss]], Texas to begin work on the U.S. rocket program.

In the U.S. he was initially involved in tests at [[White Sands Missile Range]] using V2 rockets.  These results led directly to the [[Redstone rocket]] and laid the basis for every other rocket developed in the United States since.  The White Sands work included a Mach 3 cruise missile known as the [[Hermes (missile program)|Hermes II]], based on a V2 first stage with a radical linear ramjet concept for the second stage.  His work on the Hermes II continued after he moved in 1950 with much of the von Braun team to Huntsville, Ala. as part of the Army's ballistic missile program.  There he developed the external aerodynamic design for the Army's Redstone missile, which served as the launch rocket for the nation's first live nuclear missile tests and later also launched the first U.S. astronaut into space.  He developed a successful Mach 5 ballistic re-entry nose cone using a purely theoretical approach, at a time when no [[hypersonic wind tunnel]]s existed to test the theories or provide needed data.  He subsequently continued pioneering contributions in high-speed aerothermochemistry in the [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Army's Jupiter]] intermediate-range ballistic missile program, and then on the Army's Pershing medium-range ballistic missile and the large Saturn I booster rocket.

Following the [[Sputnik crisis|Russian Sputnik launch]], in July 1960 he moved with other von Braun rocket scientists from the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] to the newly founded [[NASA]].  There, as part of the [[Apollo program|Apollo moon-landing program]], he made major contributions working on the [[Saturn V]] booster rocket, on aerothermodynamics, and on liquid hydrogen propellant systems.  He subsequently was involved in numerous projects contributing to the nation's manned and unmanned space flight programs, especially [[Skylab]] and the Space Shuttle.  In the Shuttle development effort he led a team working on vehicle aerodynamics and the main engines, which included developing full-scale component tests and scaling methodologies, and applying computational fluid dynamics to overcome a wide range of aerothermochemistry problems.

He was Chief of the Aerophysics Division at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center until 1992, when he became Chief Aerodynamicist at the NASA Center.  He was awarded the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|AIAA]] Aerodynamics Award in 1997 for his exceptional lifetime contributions to the aerodynamic design and analysis of strategic missiles and manned/unmanned launch rockets, and received the [[NASA Exceptional Service Medal]] in 2003.  He continued working in science positions at NASA until his retirement, at 89, in 2006. [[David A. King (engineer)|David King]], director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, said "America's space program is preeminent because folks like Mr. Dahm contributed to building it into the best in the world.  His life and life's work are an example of his energy, dedication and humble leadership, which has played a significant role in humanity's peaceful use of space."
