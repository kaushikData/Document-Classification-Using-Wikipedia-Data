      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9315">'''Address munging''' is the practice of disguising
an [[e-mail address]] to prevent it from being automatically collected by  unsolicited bulk e-mail providers. 
Address munging is intended to disguise an e-mail address in a way that prevents computer software from seeing the real address, or even any address at all, but still allows a human reader to reconstruct the original and contact the author: an email address such as, "&lt;nowiki&gt;no-one@example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;", becomes "no-one at example dot com", for instance.

Any e-mail address posted in public is likely to be automatically collected by [[computer software]] used by bulk emailers (a process known as [[e-mail address harvesting|e-mail address scavenging]]). Addresses posted on [[webpage]]s, [[Usenet]] or [[chat rooms]] are particularly vulnerable to this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/spamalrt.htm Email Address Harvesting: How Spammers Reap What You Sow] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424083903/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/spamalrt.htm |date=April 24, 2006 }}, Federal Trade Commission. URL accessed on 24 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Private e-mail sent between individuals is highly unlikely to be collected, but e-mail sent to a [[mailing list]] that is [[archive]]d and made available via the [[world wide web|web]], or passed onto a [[Usenet]] [[news server]] and made public, may eventually be scanned and collected.

==Disadvantages==
Disguising addresses makes it more difficult for people to send [[electronic mail|e-mail]] to each other. Many see it as an attempt to fix a symptom rather than solving the real problem of [[e-mail spam]], at the expense of causing problems for innocent users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interhack.net/pubs/munging-harmful/ Address Munging Considered Harmful], Matt Curtin&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are e-mail address harvesters who have found ways to read the munged email addresses.

The use of address munging on Usenet is contrary to the recommendations of RFC 1036 governing the format of Usenet posts, which requires a valid e-mail address be supplied in the From: field of the post. In practice, few people follow this recommendation strictly.&lt;ref&gt;See Usenet.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disguising e-mail addresses in a systematic manner (for example, user[at]domain[dot]com) offers little protection. For example, such addresses can be revealed through a simple [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22at+*+dot%22 Google Search].

Any impediment reduces the user's willingness to take the extra trouble to email the user. In contrast, well-maintained [[e-mail filtering]] on the user's end does not drive away potential correspondents. No spam filter is 100 percent immune to false positives, however, and the same potential correspondent that would have been deterred by address munging may instead end up wasting time on long letters that will merely disappear into junk mail folders.

For commercial entities, maintaining contact forms on web pages rather than publicizing e-mail addresses may be one way to ensure that incoming messages are relatively spam-free yet do not get lost. In conjunction with [[CAPTCHA]] fields, spam on such comment fields can be reduced to effectively zero, except that non-accessibility of CAPTCHAs bring exactly the same deterrent problems as address munging itself.

== Alternatives ==
As an alternative to address munging, there are several "transparent" techniques that allow people to post a valid e-mail address, but still make it difficult for automated recognition and collection of the address:

* "Transparent name mangling" involves replacing characters in the address with equivalent HTML references from the [[list of XML and HTML character entity references]], e.g. the '@' gets replaced by either 'U+0040' or '&amp;amp;#64; and the '.' gets replaced by either 'U+002E'or '&amp;amp;#46;' with the user knowing to take out the dashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crans.org/~raffo/email-munging.php|first=Daniele|last=Raffo|title=Email Munging|date=20 January 2015|accessdate=12 February 2015|website=Daniele Raffo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Posting all or part of the e-mail address as an image,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hidden-email.com/ E-mail as an image]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, no-one[[File:At sign.svg|15px|@|link=]]example.com, where the at sign is disguised as an image, sometimes with the [[alt attribute|alternative text]] specified as "@" to allow copy-and-paste, but while altering the address to remain outside of typical [[regular expression]]s of spambots.
* Using a client-side form with the e-mail address as a CSS3 animated [[ASCII art|text logo]] captcha and shrinking it to normal size using inline [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=120792 Client-side contact form generator] (the generator requires JavaScript enabled, output for displaying emails requires [[Comparison of web browsers#Web technology support|CSS]])&lt;/ref&gt;
* Posting an e-mail address with the order of characters jumbled and restoring the order using CSS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bithack.se/pub/ PHP jumbler tool] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927091755/http://bithack.se/pub/ |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Building the link by [[client-side scripting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spamstop.org/spamtools/email JavaScript address script generator] (the generator requires [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] enabled, output for displaying emails requires [[Comparison of web browsers#JavaScript support|javascript]] enabled)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using [[client-side scripting]] to produce a multi key email address encrypter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tonvanhattum.com.br/email_encrypter.php|first=Ton van|last=Hattum|title=Email Address on Your Site, SPAM Protection, Encrypting|date=13 March 2012|accessdate=22 February 2017|website=Ton van Hattum}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using [[server-side scripting]] to run a contact form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.addressmunger.com/contact_form_generator PHP contact form generator]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of munging "&lt;nowiki&gt;user@example.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;" via client-side scripting would be:
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
 &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 var name = 'user';
 var at = '@';
 var domain = 'example.com';
 document.write(name + at + domain);
 &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
The use of images and scripts for address obfuscation can cause problems for people using [[screen reader]]s and users with disabilities,
and ignores users of text browsers like [[lynx (web browser)|lynx]] and [[w3m]], although being transparent means they don't disadvantage non-English speakers that cannot understand the plain text bound to a single language that is part of non-transparent munged addresses or instructions that accompany them.

According to a 2003 study by the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]], even the simplest "transparent name mangling" of e-mail addresses can be effective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spamhelp.org/articles/030319spamreport.pdf "Why Am I Getting All This Spam? Unsolicited Commercial E-mail Research Six Month Report" March 2003.] accessed 2016-09-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml "Why Am I Getting All This Spam? Unsolicited Commercial E-mail Research Six Month Report" March 2003.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218222622/http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml |date=December 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Common methods of disguising addresses include:

{| class="wikitable"
!Disguised address
!Recovering the original address
|-
|no-one at example (dot) com
|Replace " at " with "@", and " (dot) " with "."
|-
|no-one@elpmaxe.com.invalid
|Reverse [[domain name]]: ''elpmaxe'' to ''example''&lt;br&gt;remove [[.invalid]]
|-
|moc.elpmaxe@eno-on
|Reverse the entire address
|-
|no-one@exampleREMOVEME.com
|Instructions in the address itself; remove REMOVEME.
|-
|no-one@exampleNOSPAM.com.invalid
|Remove NOSPAM and [[.invalid]] from the address.
|-
|n o - o n e @ e x a m p l e . c o m
|This is still readable, but the spaces between letters stop most automatic spambots.
|-
|no-one&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;example&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;com (as HTML)
|This is still readable and can be copied directly from webpages,&lt;br&gt;but stops many email harvesters.
|-
|''–ø–æ-–æ–ø–µ@–µ—Ö–∞—Ç—Äl–µ.—Å–æ—Ç''
|Cannot be copied directly from Webpages, must be manually copied. All letters except l are [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] [[homoglyph]]s that are identical to Latin equivalents to the human eye but are perceived differently by most computers. (See also [[IDN homograph attack]] for more malicious use of this strategy.)
|}

The reserved [[top-level domain]] [[.invalid]] is appended to ensure that a real e-mail address is not inadvertently generated.

*''Die Umbrischen Sprachdenkm√§ler'' (1851)
*''Das Stadtrecht von Bantia'' (1853), on the tablet discovered in 1790 at Oppido near [[Banzi]], containing a [[plebiscite]] relating to the municipal affairs of the ancient [[Bantia]] (the [[Stadtrecht]])
*''Das Gotische Runenalphabet'' (1852)
*''Die Fr√§nkischen Runen'' (1855)
*''Studien zur Geschichte des Griechischen Alphabets'' (4th ed., 1887).

==Biography==
After studying philosophy at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]], V√°zquez emigrated to Mexico in 1939 with thousands of other intellectuals, scientists and artists following the defeat of the Republic in the [[Spanish Civil War]], in which he participated as editor of the central publication of the Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas (JSU) ‚ÄúAhora‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;Adolfo S√°nchez V√°zquez would later write of this position: ‚ÄúBearing in mind that we are talking about the central publication of the most important youth organisation in the Republican zone, with more than 200,000 members, and the enormous influence that it exerted through these members on the Popular Army, this was an enormous responsibility given my 21 years of age‚Äù (A. S√°nchez V√°zquez, ‚ÄúVida y filosof√≠a‚Äù, ''Anthropos'', Barcelona, no. 52, August 1985, p. 12.)&lt;/ref&gt; S√°nchez was appointed a full-time professor of philosophy at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] in 1959, becoming a [[professor emeritus]] of the university in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Galv√°n Ch√°vez, Ana.

He embraced [[Marxism]], although an open, renovating, critical and non-dogmatic version of it.  His fresh interpretation of Marxism ran parallel to that of the [[Frankfurt School]]. In fact, ''The Philosophy of Praxis'' was published at around the same time as [[Herbert Marcuse]] was writing his '' [[One Dimensional Man]]''. In regard to [[ethics]], he opposed [[Normative ethics|normativism]].

'''Albertus Magnus''',&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-la|Albertus Teutonicus, Albertus Coloniensis}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dominican Order|O.P.]] (c. 1193 ‚Äì November 15, 1280), also known as '''Saint Albert the Great''' and '''Albert of Cologne''', was a [[Germans|German]] [[Catholic]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] and [[Catholic bishop|bishop]]. Later canonised as a [[Catholic saint]], he was known during his lifetime as ''Doctor universalis'' and ''Doctor expertus'' and, late in his life, the [[sobriquet]] ''[[List of people known as "the Great"|Magnus]]'' was appended to his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Weisheipl |editor-first=James A. |last=Weisheipl |first=James A. |title=Albertus Magnus and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays |place=Toronto |publisher=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies |series=Studies and texts |volume=49 |year=1980 |chapter=The Life and Works of St. Albert the Great |page=46 |isbn=0-88844-049-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as James A. Weisheipl and Joachim R. S√∂der have referred to him as the greatest German philosopher and theologian of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Joachim R. S√∂der, "Albert der Grosse ‚Äì ein staunen- erregendes Wunder," Wort und Antwort 41 (2000): 145; J.A. Weisheipl, "Albertus Magnus," Joseph Strayer ed., Dictionary of the Middle Ages 1 (New York: Scribner, 1982) 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]] distinguishes him as one of the 36 [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]].

==Biography==
It seems likely that Albert was born sometime before 1200, given well-attested evidence that he was aged over 80 on his death in 1280. More than one source says that Albert was 87 on his death, which has led 1193 to be commonly given as the date of Albert's birth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Albert was probably born in Lauingen (now in [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]]), since he called himself 'Albert of Lauingen', but this might simply be a family name. Most probably his family was of ''ministerial'' class; his familiar connection with (being son of the count) Bollst√§dt noble family was a 15th-century misinterpretation that is now completely disproved.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tugwell, Simon. ''Albert and Thomas,'' New York Paulist Press, 1988, p. 3, 96‚Äì7&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2016}}

Albert was probably educated principally at the [[University of Padua]], where he received instruction in [[Aristotle]]'s writings. A late account by Rudolph de Novamagia refers to Albertus' encounter with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], who convinced him to enter [[Holy Orders]]. In 1223 (or 1229){{sfn|Tugwell|1988|pp=4‚Äì5}} he became a member of the [[Dominican Order]], and studied [[theology]] at [[Bologna]] and elsewhere. Selected to fill the position of lecturer at Cologne, Germany, where the Dominicans had a house, he taught for several years there, as well as in [[Regensburg]], [[Freiburg]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Hildesheim]]. During his first tenure as lecturer at Cologne, Albert wrote his ''Summa de bono'' after discussion with [[Philip the Chancellor]] concerning the transcendental properties of being.&lt;ref name="Kovach, Francs 1980, p.X"&gt;Kovach, Francs, and Rober Shahan. Albert the Great: Commemorative Essays . Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press, 1980, p.X&lt;/ref&gt; In 1245, Albert became [[master of theology]] under Gueric of Saint-Quentin, the first German Dominican to achieve this distinction. Following this turn of events, Albert was able to teach theology at the [[University of Paris]] as a full-time professor, holding the seat of the Chair of Theology at the College of St. James.&lt;ref name="Kovach, Francs 1980, p.X" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hampden, ''The Life'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time [[Thomas Aquinas]] began to study under Albertus.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm Kennedy, Daniel. "St. Albertus Magnus." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 10 Sept. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vincenzo onofri, sant'alberto magno, 1493.JPG|thumb|left|Bust of Albertus Magnus by [[Vincenzo Onofri]], c. 1493]]

Albert was the first to comment on virtually all of the writings of [[Aristotle]], thus making them accessible to wider academic debate. The study of Aristotle brought him to study and comment on the teachings of Muslim academics, notably [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]], and this would bring him into the heart of academic debate.

In 1254 Albert was made [[provincial superior|provincial]] of the Dominican Order,&lt;ref name=Kennedy /&gt; and fulfilled the duties of the office with great care and efficiency. During his tenure he publicly defended the Dominicans against attacks by the secular and regular faculty of the University of Paris, commented on [[John the Evangelist]], and answered what he perceived as errors of the [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] Averroes.

In 1259 Albert took part in the General Chapter of the Dominicans at [[Valenciennes]] together with Thomas Aquinas, masters Bonushomo Britto,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Histoire litt√©raire de la France: XIIIe si√®cle |volume=19 |page=103 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIYNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=bonushomo#v=onepage&amp;q=bonushomo&amp;f=false |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florentius,&lt;ref&gt;Probably Florentius de Hidinio, a.k.a.

This innovation initiated the tradition of Dominican scholastic philosophy put into practice, for example, in 1265 at the Order's ''[[studium provinciale]]'' at the convent of [[Santa Sabina]] in Rome, out of which would develop the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]], the "Angelicum".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domcentral.org/study/opstudy.htm Weisheipl O.P., J.

[[File:2004 K√∂ln Sarkophag Albertus Magnus.JPG|thumb|Roman [[sarcophagus]] containing the relics of Albertus Magnus in the crypt of [[St. Andrew's Church, Cologne]], Germany]]

In 1260 [[Pope Alexander IV]] made him [[bishop of Regensburg]], an office from which he resigned after three years. During the exercise of his duties he enhanced his reputation for humility by refusing to ride a horse, in accord with the dictates of the Order, instead traversing his huge diocese on foot. This earned him the affectionate sobriquet "boots the bishop" from his parishioners. In 1263 [[Pope Urban IV]] relieved him of the duties of bishop and asked him to preach the [[eighth Crusade]] in German-speaking countries.&lt;ref name=Markus&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/albert-great/ F√ºhrer, Markus, "Albert the Great", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),]&lt;/ref&gt;  After this, he was especially known for acting as a mediator between conflicting parties. In Cologne he is not only known for being the founder of Germany's oldest university there, but also for "the big verdict" (der Gro√üe Schied) of 1258, which brought an end to the conflict between the citizens of Cologne and the archbishop. Among the last of his labors was the defense of the orthodoxy of his former pupil, Thomas Aquinas, whose death in 1274 grieved Albert (the story that he travelled to Paris in person to defend the teachings of Aquinas can not be confirmed).

Albert was a scientist, philosopher, astrologer, theologian, spiritual writer, ecumenist, and diplomat. Under the auspices of Humbert of Romans, Albert molded the curriculum of studies for all Dominican students, introduced Aristotle to the classroom and probed the work of [[Neoplatonists]], such as [[Plotinus]]. Indeed, it was the thirty years of work done by Aquinas and himself that allowed for the inclusion of Aristotelian study in the curriculum of Dominican schools.

After suffering a collapse of health in 1278, he died on November 15, 1280, in the Dominican convent in Cologne, [[Germany]]. Since November 15, 1954, his relics are in a Roman sarcophagus in the [[crypt]] of the Dominican St. [[Andreas]] Church in Cologne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gemeinden.erzbistum-koeln.de/st_andreas_koeln/albertusMagnus/ |title=Zeittafel |publisher=Gemeinden.erzbistum-koeln.de |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his body was discovered to be [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]] at the first exhumation three years after his death, at the exhumation in 1483 only a skeleton remained.&lt;ref name="Cruz 1977"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Incorruptibles: A Study of the Incorruption of the Bodies of Various Catholic Saints and Beati |last=Carroll Cruz |first=Joan |publisher=TAN Books |location=[[Charlotte, NC]] |year=1977 |isbn=0-89555-066-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert was [[beatified]] in 1622. He was [[canonized]] and proclaimed a Doctor of the Church on December 16, 1931, by [[Pope Pius XI]]&lt;ref name=Markus /&gt; and the patron saint of natural scientists in 1941. St. Albert's [[feast day]] is November 15.

==Writings==
[[File:Albertus Magnus-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Albertus Magnus monument at the [[University of Cologne]]]]

Albert's writings collected in 1899 went to thirty-eight volumes. These displayed his prolific habits and encyclopedic knowledge of topics such as [[logic]], [[theology]], [[botany]], [[geography]], [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[mineralogy]], [[alchemy]], [[zoology]], [[physiology]], [[phrenology]], [[justice]], [[law]], [[friendship]], and [[love]]. He digested, interpreted, and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. Most modern knowledge of Aristotle was preserved and presented by Albert.&lt;ref name=Kennedy /&gt;

His principal theological works are a commentary in three volumes on the Books of the Sentences of [[Peter Lombard]] (''Magister Sententiarum''), and the ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'' in two volumes. The latter is in substance a more didactic repetition of the former.

Albert's activity, however, was more philosophical than theological (see [[Scholasticism]]). The philosophical works, occupying the first six and the last of the 21 volumes, are generally divided according to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] scheme of the sciences, and consist of interpretations and condensations of Aristotle's relative works, with supplementary discussions upon contemporary topics, and occasional divergences from the opinions of the master. Albert believed that Aristotle's approach to natural philosophy did not pose any obstacle to the development of a Christian philosophical view of the natural order.&lt;ref name=Markus /&gt;

[[File:Firenze, alberto magno, de animalibus, 1450-1500 ca. cod fiesolano 67, 01.JPG|thumb|250px|''De animalibus'' (1450‚Äì1500 ca., cod. fiesolano 67, [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]])]]

Albert's knowledge of natural science was considerable and for the age remarkably accurate. His industry in every department was great: not only did he produce commentaries and paraphrases of the entire Aristotelian corpus, including his scientific works, but Albert also added to and improved upon them. His books on topics like botany, zoology, and minerals included information from ancient sources, but also results of his own empirical investigations. These investigations pushed several of the special sciences forward, beyond the reliance on classical texts. In the case of embryology, for example, it has been claimed that little of value was written between Aristotle and Albert, who managed to identify organs within eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-09-01|title=Much more from the chicken's egg than breakfast ‚Äì a wonderful model system|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925477304001121|journal=Mechanisms of Development|language=en|volume=121|issue=9|pages=1015‚Äì1017|doi=10.1016/j.mod.2004.04.021|issn=0925-4773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Albert also effectively invented entire special sciences, where Aristotle has not covered a topic. For example, prior to Albert, there was no systematic study of minerals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For the breadth of these achievements, he was bestowed the name ''Doctor Universalis.''

Much of Albert's empirical contributions to the natural sciences have been superseded, but his general approach to science may be surprisingly modern. For example, in ''De Mineralibus'' (Book II, Tractate ii, Ch. 1) Albert claims, "For it is [the task] of natural science not simply to accept what we are told but to inquire into the causes of natural things."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ia800600.us.archive.org/35/items/308059821ALBERTUSMAGNUSTheBookOfMinerals/308059821-ALBERTUS-MAGNUS-The-Book-of-Minerals.pdf|title=Book of Minerals|last=Wyckoff|first=Dorothy|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1967|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alchemy==
[[File:Liebig Company Trading Card Ad 01.12.003 front.tif|thumb|left|250px| Albertus Magnus, Chimistes Celebres, [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]] Trading Card, 1929]]

In the centuries since his death, many stories arose about Albert as an [[Alchemy|alchemist]] and magician. "Much of the modern confusion results from the fact that later works, particularly the alchemical work known as the ''Secreta Alberti'' or the ''Experimenta Alberti'', were falsely attributed to Albertus by their authors to increase the prestige of the text through association."&lt;ref&gt;Katz, David A., "An Illustrated History of Alchemy and Early Chemistry", 1978&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of alchemy and chemistry, many treatises relating to alchemy have been attributed to him, though in his authentic writings he had little to say on the subject, and then mostly through commentary on Aristotle. For example, in his commentary, ''De mineralibus'', he refers to the power of stones, but does not elaborate on what these powers might be.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wieland, "Albert der Grosse.  Der Entwurf einer eigenst√§ndigen Philosophie," Philosophen des Mittelalters (Darmstadt: Primus, 2000) 124-39.&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of Pseudo-Albertine works dealing with alchemy exist, though, showing the belief developed in the generations following Albert's death that he had mastered alchemy, one of the fundamental sciences of the Middle Ages. These include ''Metals and Materials''; the ''Secrets of Chemistry''; the ''Origin of Metals''; the ''Origins of Compounds'', and a ''Concordance ''which is a collection of ''Observations on the [[philosopher's stone]]''; and other alchemy-chemistry topics, collected under the name of ''Theatrum Chemicum''.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, John, ''The Thirteenth, Greatest of Centuries.'' 1907:46 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=_rofAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA46&amp;dq=albertus+magnus+gold+minerals#PRA2-PA46,M1 available online]).&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with the discovery of the element [[arsenic]]&lt;ref name="BuildingBlocks451-3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Emsley |first=John |title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-850341-5 |pages=43,513,529 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and experimented with photosensitive chemicals, including [[silver nitrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davidson |first=Michael W. |author2=National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at The Florida State University |title=Molecular Expressions: Science, Optics and You&amp;nbsp;‚Äî Timeline&amp;nbsp;‚Äî Albertus Magnus |publisher=The Florida State University |date=2003-08-01 |url=http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/timeline/people/magnus.html |accessdate=2009-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330045629/http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/timeline/people/magnus.html |archivedate=2010-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Szabadv√°ry |first=Ferenc |title=History of analytical chemistry |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1992 |location= |page=17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53APqy0KDaQC |isbn=2-88124-569-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that stones had occult properties, as he related in his work ''De mineralibus''. However, there is scant evidence that he personally performed alchemical experiments.

According to legend, Albert is said to have discovered the philosopher's stone and passed it on to his pupil Thomas Aquinas, shortly before his death. Albert does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by "transmutation."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn and Frederick E. Budd. ''A Survey of the Occult.'' Electric Book Company. 2001. p. 28-30. {{ISBN|1-84327-087-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Thomas Aquinas died six years before Albert's death, this legend as stated is unlikely.

==Astrology==

Albert was deeply interested in [[astrology]], as has been articulated by scholars such as Paola Zambelli&lt;ref&gt;Paola Zambelli, "The Speculum Astronomiae and its Enigma" Dordrecht.&lt;/ref&gt; and Scott Hendrix.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Throughout the Middle Ages&amp;nbsp;‚Äìand well into the early modern period‚Äì astrology was widely accepted by scientists and intellectuals who held the view that life on earth is effectively a microcosm within the macrocosm (the latter being the cosmos itself). It was believed that correspondence therefore exists between the two and thus the celestial bodies follow patterns and cycles analogous to those on earth. With this worldview, it seemed reasonable to assert that astrology could be used to predict the probable future of a human being. Albert argued that an understanding of the celestial influences affecting us could help us to live our lives more in accord with Christian precepts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Scott E. Hendrix, How Albert the Great's Speculum Astronomiae Was Interpreted and Used by Four Centuries of Readers (Lewiston: 2010), 44-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The most comprehensive statement of his astrological beliefs is to be found in a work he authored around 1260, now known as the ''[[Speculum astronomiae]]''. However, details of these beliefs can be found in almost everything he wrote, from his early ''De natura boni'' to his last work, the ''Summa theologiae''.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrix, 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Matter and form==
Albert believed that all natural things were compositions of matter and form, he referred to it as ''quod est'' and ''quo est''. Albert also believed that God alone is the absolute ruling entity. Albert's version of [[hylomorphism]] is very similar to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] doctrine.

==Music==
Albert is known for his commentary on the musical practice of his times. Most of his written musical observations are found in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Poetics''. He rejected the idea of "[[Musica universalis|music of the spheres]]" as ridiculous: movement of astronomical bodies, he supposed, is incapable of generating sound. He wrote extensively on proportions in music, and on the three different subjective levels on which [[plainchant]] could work on the human soul: purging of the impure; illumination leading to contemplation; and nourishing perfection through contemplation. Of particular interest to 20th-century music theorists is the attention he paid to silence as an integral part of music.

==Metaphysics of morals==
Both of his early treatises, ''De natura boni'' and ''De bono'', start with a metaphysical investigation into the concepts of the good in general and the physical good. Albert refers to the physical good as ''bonum naturae''. Albert does this before directly dealing with the moral concepts of metaphysics. In Albert's later works, he says in order to understand human or moral goodness, the individual must first recognize what it means to be good and do good deeds. This procedure reflects Albert's preoccupations with neo-Platonic theories of good as well as the doctrines of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]].&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Albert's view was highly valued by the Catholic Church and his peers.

==Natural law==
Albert devoted the last tractatus of ''De Bono'' to a theory of justice and [[natural law]]. Albert places God as the pinnacle of justice and natural law. God legislates and divine authority is supreme. Up until his time, it was the only work specifically devoted to natural law written by a theologian or philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.207&lt;/ref&gt;

==Friendship==

Albert mentions friendship in his work, ''De bono'', as well as presenting his ideals and morals of friendship in the very beginning of ''Tractatus II''. Later in his life he published ''Super Ethica''.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.242&lt;/ref&gt; With his development of friendship throughout his work it is evident that friendship ideals and morals took relevance as his life went on. Albert comments on Aristotle's view of friendship with a quote from [[Cicero]], who writes, "friendship is nothing other than the harmony between things divine and human, with goodwill and love". Albert agrees with this commentary but he also adds in harmony or agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.243&lt;/ref&gt; Albert calls this harmony, ''consensio'', itself a certain kind of movement within the human spirit. Albert fully agrees with Aristotle in the sense that friendship is a virtue. Albert relates the inherent metaphysical contentedness between friendship and moral goodness. Albert describes several levels of goodness; the useful (''utile''), the pleasurable (''delectabile'') and the authentic or unqualified good (''honestum''). Then in turn there are three levels of friendship based on each of those levels, namely friendship based on usefulness (''amicitia utilis''), friendship based on pleasure (''amicitia delectabilis''), and friendship rooted in unqualified goodness (''amicitia honesti''; ''amicitia quae fundatur super honestum'').&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Stanley. Reclaiming Moral Agency: The Moral Philosophy of Albert the Great. Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Of America Press, 2008 p.244&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[iconography]] of the [[pediment|tympanum]] and [[archivolt]]s of the late 13th-century [[gate|portal]] of [[Notre Dame de Strasbourg|Strasbourg Cathedral]] was inspired by Albert's writings.&lt;ref&gt;''France: A Phaidon Cultural Guide'', Phaidon Press, 1985, {{ISBN|0-7148-2353-8}}, p. 705&lt;/ref&gt; Albert is frequently mentioned by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], who made his doctrine of [[free will]] the basis of his ethical system. In his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', Dante places Albertus with his pupil Thomas Aquinas among the great lovers of wisdom (''Spiriti Sapienti'') in the Heaven of the Sun. Albert is also mentioned, along with [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa|Agrippa]] and [[Paracelsus]], in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', in which his writings influence a young [[Victor Frankenstein]].

In ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'', [[S√∏ren Kierkegaard]] wrote that Albert, "arrogantly boasted of his speculation before the deity and suddenly became stupid." Kierkegaard cites [[Gotthard Oswald Marbach]] whom he quotes as saying "''Albertus repente ex asino factus philosophus et ex philosopho asinus''" [Albert was suddenly transformed from an ass into a philosopher and from a philosopher into an ass].&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'', [[Princeton University Press]], 1980, {{ISBN|0-691-02011-6}}, pp. 150‚Äì151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
His main fields of interest are in the philosophy of linguistics and [[theoretical linguistics]] with special respect to the foundational problems of [[syntax]], [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]]. Within the framework of his modular philosophy of linguistics he revealed the relationship between the [[Cognition|cognitive]] and the social factors of linguistic theorizing. He extended the methods of both modular and holistic cognitive linguistics to the analysis of scientific concept formation. He developed the [[heuristic]]s of the segmental [[phonology]] of [[German language|German]]. Together with Csilla R√°kosi he put forward the so-called ‚Äôp-model‚Äô of plausible argumentation which, besides capturing the structure of linguistic theories, can also be applied to the solution of problems in the general philosophy of science and argumentation theory.

'''Angelo Pirotta''', [[Dominican Order|O.P.]] (December 27, 1894 ‚Äì November 16, 1956) was a major Maltese philosopher. His areas of specialisation in philosophy were chiefly [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f‚ÄôMalta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. II, pp. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===The early years===
Pirotta was born at [[Naxxar]], [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;All biographical information is reproduced from Mark Montebello‚Äôs ''Angelo Pirotta: A Maltese philosopher of the first water'', Maltese Dominican Province, Malta, 2006, with full permission of the copyright holders.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if his family lived hand to mouth, he was the first of thirteen children, three of whom died in infancy.

Pirotta was first privately schooled by Canon Fortunato De Bono. Later, he eventually enrolled on a regular course at the government-owned high school for boys (the Lyceum) at [[Valletta]]. He completed the course at the Lyceum up till the age of sixteen. Thereafter, he joined the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] almost immediately, on April 30, 1911.

===Initial formation===
At Rabat, together with his companions, Pirotta began his novitiate, and then, a year later, made his simple (three-year) profession on May 12, 1912. Thereafter, he began his institutional studies; three years of philosophy (1912‚Äì15), and four of theology (1915‚Äì19), of course all according to the [Thomist] tradition. He made his religious profession on May 11, 1915.

After completing his second year of theology (1916/17), Pirotta was chosen to continue his theological studies at [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)|Pontifical International Angelicum College]] in Rome, the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']]. In the meantime, he was ordained a priest by on September 22, 1917, at the [[St. John‚Äôs Co-Cathedral]], [[Valletta]], [[Malta]].

In [[Rome]] Pirotta resided at the [[Angelicum]] College itself. After his two years of theology (1917‚Äì19), on July 1, 1919, he successfully set for his Lectorate exams with a dissertation entitled '''''De Reali Distinctione inter Essentiam et Esse in Creatis''''' (The Real Distinction between Essence and Existence in Created Being). Thereafter, he proceeded with his post-graduate studies in philosophy (1919‚Äì21). Meanwhile, he also prepared his doctorate thesis, entitled '''''De Supposto et Persona''''', which he successfully defended on, July 1, 1921.

===The Italy years===

====At Viterbo====
Pirotta‚Äôs first academic assignment was at [[Viterbo]]. Here he spent five academic years (1921‚Äì26), teaching history of philosophy, natural science (also called ‚Äòphysics‚Äô), and theodicy (''theologia fundamentalis''; now called natural theology). Here he was frequently invited to address the ''Circulus Philosophicus'' (Philosophical Discussion Group), and was also asked to contribute to prestigious Thomistic periodicals, read sermons, and give speeches. At Viterbo, Pirotta also prepared his first major publication, and frankly his most successful composition to date: an exposition of [[Aquinas]]‚Äô commentary on [[Aristotle]]‚Äôs '''''De Anima''''' (On the Soul).

====At Rome====
After [[Viterbo]], Pirotta returned to [[Rome]] to assume a teaching post at the [[Angelicum]] College. Here Pirotta remained for just two years (1926-28), teaching philosophy, theodicy, logic, and ontology.

In terms of literary production, Pirotta‚Äôs Roman years correspond to a very prolific and industrious period. He wrote reviews, scientific articles, and even prepared and published his second major work: another exposition on [[Aquinas]]‚Äô commentaries on [[Aristotle]]‚Äôs '''''De Sensu et Sensato''''' (On Sense and Sensibility) and '''''De Memoria et Reminiscientia''''' (On Memory and Remembrance).

====Interlude in Malta====
In 1928 Pirotta had to retire momentarily to his homeland since his family was in dire straits. One of his brothers became seriously ill, and his mother was ill and dying. She succumbed on July 5, 1929.

In [[Malta]] Pirotta spent two academic years (1928‚Äì30), residing and lecturing at [[Rabat, Malta]]. More or less as usual, Pirotta read philosophy, the history of philosophy, and apologetics. He also continued to publish steadily, especially scientific reviews and articles.

====At Fiesole====
Back in Italy, Pirotta was sent to College of [[Fiesole]], near [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The college here was not a public one, but the academic institution that prepared [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] students for the [[priesthood]]. Pirotta stayed here for just one academic year (1930/31), reading the history of philosophy, and the treatise on divine revelation.

Here he also worked upon the first of his six-volumed ''Summa Philosoph√¶'' (The Sum of Philosophy), which he published in 1931. He also prepared for his Masters. The final exam was successfully held on May 7, 1931, in [[Rome]] at the [[Angelicum]] College, which by that time had been upgraded to the status of an international university. As was the usual practice, the title was conferred four years later. The official investiture was held at the Dominican Priory at [[Rabat, Malta]] on November 24, 1935.

====At Naples====
After [[Tuscany]] came [[Naples]]. Here, at the [[Aquinas]] College of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], Pirotta did not go simply as a lecturer, but as a Rector (''‚ÄòLectorem Primarium‚Äô''). He stayed here for three consecutive academic years (1931‚Äì34).

At Naples, Pirotta may be considered to have been at the peak of his academic career. At the beginning of his experience there he published the first of his planned six-volumed ''Summa Philosoph√¶'': a study about Aristotelico-Thomistic logic, called the '''''Philosophia Rationalis''''' (Rational Philosophy). Later, he proceeded to publish his third exposition: this time of Aquinas‚Äô commentary on [[Aristotle]]‚Äôs '''''Ethicorum ad Nichomachum''''' (Nichomachean Ethics).

===In Malta===
In 1934, Pirotta was recalled to [[Malta]], at [[Rabat, Malta]]. During the first academic year (1934/35) he was just a lecturer of philosophy. In the following year, however, he was chosen to be the Rector of the college. He retained this office for nine years, up till 1944, which included the worst of the [[World War II]] years in [[Malta]].

At the beginning of the 1935/36 academic year, Pirotta was officially conferred with his Masters. A few months later, he issued his second volume of the ''Summa Philosophi√¶'', the one dealing with natural philosophy, and called '''''Philosophia Naturalis'''''.

In 1938 Pirotta applied for the Deanship of philosophy at the [[Royal University of Malta]]. Though unmatched or much less unsurpassed by any other contender, he lost the competition nonetheless. Though he took the rebuff most gracefully, Pirotta decided to make some drastic changes to his life. Thus, from 1939 onwards, right up to his death, he lived the larger part of his days at [[Naxxar]], staying at his convent at [[Rabat, Malta]] only as little as possible.

At [[Rabat, Malta]] Pirotta was still the Rector, and still read philosophy at the college there. Also from 1939 onwards, he acted as supplementary examiner at the [[Royal University of Malta]]. He further continued to deliver sermons here and there, and even to hear confessions on a regular basis.

===Retirement and death===
Before the war was over, at the end of the academic year of 1943/44, Pirotta ‚Äì now almost fifty years of age ‚Äì was relieved of the post of Rector at [[Rabat, Malta]]. During these years he assiduously worked on his next publication, which eventually had to be his last. This was his fourth exposition, the one on [[Aquinas]]‚Äô eight books of commentaries on [[Aristotle]]‚Äôs '''''De Physico Auditu''''' (Physics). It was published in 1953.

One fatal day in the latter part of 1955, Pirotta became victim of acute cerebral vascular insufficiency due to diabetes and chronic smoking. As a result, his memory had become seriously impaired, and so was his reasoning powers. He died at his parents‚Äô home at [[Naxxar]] on November 16, 1956, a month short of his sixty-second birthday, and buried in the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] church of Our Lady of the Grotto at [[Rabat, Malta]].

==Works==

===Opus magnum===
* The '''''Summa Philosophi√¶ Aristotelico-Thomistic√¶''''' (The Sum of Aritotelico-Thomistic Philosophy) ‚Äì Pirotta planned to publish six volumes to complete this work. Unfortunately, he only succeeded in publishing just the first two. The other four volumes remained manuscripts in different phases of preparation. Undoubtedly, the works of this large-scale project represent Pirotta‚Äôs philosophical prowess at its very best.
** VOL. I ‚Äì '''''Philosophia Rationalis''''' (Rational Philosophy; 1931) ‚Äì This book in Latin, containing 267 pages (and twelve preliminary pages with Roman enumeration), was published by Marietti of [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. It is the first volume of Pirotta‚Äôs incomplete ''Summa Philosophi√¶'' project. The volume opens with a preface and a general introduction to philosophy; and closes with a chart that shows the classification of the philosophical sciences according to the Aristotelico-Thomistic school of thought. All paragraphs contained in the book are numbered. Essentially, Pirotta‚Äôs ''Rational Philosophy'' is a study about logic.
**VOL. II ‚Äì '''''Philosophia Naturalis''''' (Natural Philosophy; 1936) ‚Äì The second volume of the incomplete ''Summa'' project took five years to finalize. This book is also in Latin, as most of Pirotta‚Äôs writings, and contains 820 pages, excluding the eight preliminary pages with Roman enumeration. Like the other volume, it was published with Marietti of [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. The book opens with a foreword to the reader, and an introduction; and concludes with an appendix. All paragraphs contained in the book are numbered. Obviously, the writing deals with natural philosophy.
**VOL. III ‚Äì '''''Metaphysica Ostensiva Generalis seu Ontologia''''' (General Demonstrative Metaphysics or Ontology; ''c.''1935-40)&lt;ref&gt;ADR, MSS. A164##1 u 2.&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äì This volume in the series should have begun to present Pirotta‚Äôs work on metaphysics. Unfortunately it was never published, though its manuscript shows that it was in an advanced state of composition.
**VOL. IV ‚Äì '''''Metaphysica Ostensiva Specialis: Metaphysica Entis Creati''''' (Specific Demonstrative Metaphysics: the Metaphysics of Created Being; ''c.''1935-40)&lt;ref&gt;ADR, MSS. A165##1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äì Again, this writing, intended to be the fourth volume in a series of six forming the ''Summa Philosophi√¶ Aristotelico-Thomistic√¶'', was never completed. In its present form of preparation it is difficult to say what the complete final product would have been. The extant manuscript has parts that are compete and others that aren‚Äôt. Certainly, whole parts that would have been part of the final version have never been written. The whole manuscript is made up of 580 large folios.
**VOL. V ‚Äì '''''Metaphysica Ostensiva Specialis: Metaphysica Entis Increati sive Theologia Naturalis seu Theodicea''''' (Specific Demonstrative Metaphysics: the Metaphysics of Uncreated Being otherwise Natural Theology or Theodicy; ''c.''1935-40)&lt;ref&gt;ADR, MS. A166.&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äì Surprisingly, amongst the four incomplete manuscripts of Pirotta‚Äôs ''Summa Philosophi√¶ Aristotelico-Thomistic√¶'', this is the most complete. In fact, though it had to be the fifth volume of the series, the ''Metaphysica Ostensiva Specialis'' is practically all ready to go to the printers. It is a matter of speculation whether Pirotta actually intended to publish this fifth volume before the third and fourth. The manuscript is made up of 569 folios.
**VOL. VI ‚Äì '''''Metaphysica Defensiva seu Critica''''' (Explicative Metaphysics or Criteriology; ''c.''1935-40)&lt;ref&gt;ADR, MS. A167#1, #2 u #3.&lt;/ref&gt; ‚Äì This is most incomplete of Pirotta‚Äôs series of manuscripts related to his ''Summa Philosophi√¶ Aristotelico-Thomistic√¶''. The philosopher worked very little on it as a whole, though then segments of it are actually finalized. The entirety of the extant manuscript comprises a staggering 1260 large folios. However, due to its undeveloped state of composition it is practically impossible to imagine what the final shape of the work would have taken.

===Commentaries===

The commentaries would represent the main output for a Thomistic intellectual with which he really shows his mettle. Apart of Pirotta‚Äôs two published volumes that were part of his ''Summa Philosophi√¶ Aristotelico-Thomistic√¶'', published in 1931 and 1936 respectively, these commentaries‚Äïespecially the first on the ''De Anima''‚Äïwere in fact the intellectual productions that effectively brought Pirotta most renown.

* '''''Commentarium De Anima''''' ([Aquinas‚Äô] Commentary on [Aristotle‚Äôs] ‚ÄòOn the Soul‚Äô; 1925) ‚Äì This book in Latin, which contains 307 pages (excluding the thirteen preliminary pages enumerated with Roman numerals), was published with Marietti of [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. Its whole title is: ''Sancti Thom√¶ Aquinatis Doctoris Angelici Ord. Pr√¶d. In Aristotelis Librum De Anima Commentarium'' (The Commentary of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], the Angelic Doctor of the Order of Preachers, on [[Aristotle]]‚Äôs Book ''On the Soul''). The volume is dedicated to Mons. Angelo Portelli O.P., Malta‚Äôs then Auxiliary Bishop. The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] archive at [[Rabat, Malta]], possesses the galley proofs for a new edition of the work,&lt;ref&gt;ADR, MS. A168.&lt;/ref&gt; which, incidentally, was never published. Essentially, Pirotta‚Äôs work is a commentary on [[Aquinas]]‚Äô exposition of [[Aristotle]]‚Äôs ''On the Soul''.
* '''''De Sensu et Sensato ‚Äì De Memoria et Reminiscientia''''' ([Aquinas‚Äô Commentary on Aristotle‚Äôs] ‚ÄòOn Sense and Sensibility‚Äô [and] ‚ÄòOn Memory and Remembrance‚Äô; 1928) ‚Äì A book in Latin published with Marietti of [[Turin]], [[Italy]], that comprises nine preliminary pages with Roman enumeration, and a further 158 pages. Its whole title is: ''Sancti Thom√¶ Aquinatis Doctoris Angelici Ord. Pr√¶d. In Aristotelis Libros De Sensu et Sensato De Memoria et Reminiscentia Commentarium'' (The Commentary of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], the Angelic Doctor of the Order of Preachers, on [[Aristotle]]‚Äôs Books ''On Sense and Sensibility'' [and] ''On Memory and Remembrance''). The book is dedicated to a certain Fortunato De Bono, a Maltese early teacher of Pirotta. Essentially, the writing is an interpretation of [[Aquinas]]‚Äô exposition of [[Aristotle]]‚Äôs two works.
* '''''Ethicorum Aristotelis ad Nichomachum''''' ([Aquinas‚Äô Exposition of] Aristotle‚Äôs ‚ÄòNicomachean Ethics‚Äô; 1934) ‚Äì This publication follows on the warm reception given to Pirotta‚Äôs two commentaries on [[Aquinas]]‚Äôs exposition of [[Aristotle]]‚Äôs ''On the Soul'', and ''On Sense'' and ''On Memory''. In the intervening years, Pirotta had also published his first volume of his ''Sum of Philosophy''. This volume of 696 pages, excluding the twenty-four preliminary pages with Romon enumeration, was also published with Marietti of [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. Its whole title reads: ''Sancti Thom√¶ Aquinatis Doctoris Angelici Ord. Pr√¶d. In Decem Libros Ethicorum Aristotelis ad Nicomachum Expositio'' (The Exposition of Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], Angelic Doctor of the Order of Preachers, on the Ten Books of [[Aristotle]]‚Äôs ''Nicomachean Ethics''). The book is dedicated to Fr. M. S. Gillet O.P., the Master General of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s.
* '''''In Octo Libri De Physico Auditu sive Physicorum Aristotelis Commentaria''''' ([Aquinas‚Äô] Eight Books on [Aristotle‚Äôs] ‚ÄòPhysics‚Äô or [Aquinas‚Äô] Commentary of Aristotle‚Äôs ‚ÄòPhysics‚Äô; 1953) ‚Äì This is the last of Pirotta‚Äôs major contributions to scholastic philosophy, published barely three years before his death. The study, obviously in Latin, is made up of 658 pages, and was published by M. D‚ÄôAuria Pontificius Editor of [[Naples]], [[Italy]]. The book is divided into eight books, and then into lectures (''lectio''). The first and second Books contain fifteen lectures each; the third, two less; the fourth, twenty-three; the fifth, ten; the sixth, another thirteen; the seventh, just nine; and the eighth, twenty-three. Basically, Pirotta‚Äôs work is a commentary on [[Aquinas]]‚Äô exposition of Aritotle‚Äôs ''Physics''.

===Articles===

Unlike the commentaries, these articles take up some point or aspect of a particular theme on which Pirotta expands upon. With the exception of the very early ones, published by Pirotta when still at the beginning of his career, the rest are master works that would have been minutely scrutinized by the editorial boards concerned before publication, and furthermore exposed Pirotta‚Äôs intellect to a wide readership within international Thomistic academic circles. After publication, almost all of these articles had been subsequently distributed as separate extracts.

===Scientific reviews===

The following reviews, though interesting in themselves, contain little philosophical value. What they do attest to is the standing Pirotta enjoyed with the various editors of the respective scientific journals who had valued Pirotta‚Äôs proficiency enough so as to consider him an academic and intellectual worthy of passing authoritative judgement on the writings of other reputed Thomists. Pirotta does not disappoint. He showers praise when earned, but certainly does not shy away from lashing out when warranted.

===Manuscripts===

Pirotta‚Äôs manuscripts are invaluable documents, as they attest to his background operational activities, and moreover to the keenness and responsibility with which he undertook any commitment, especially those of a philosophical nature. Most of the following texts are incomplete, as Pirotta had not as yet given them their final finishing. To some he surely intended to add on other material. Nonetheless, even as they stand, these documents can be taken as reliable attestations to Pirotta‚Äôs proficiency of labour, and intensity of thought.

===Philosophical notes===

The following list of notes are working annotations prepared by Pirotta for various publications, academic talks, or lectures, over an extended period of time. All of them are undated. Some of them had been grouped by Pirotta under the title ''‚ÄòStudia Philosophica‚Äô'' (Philosophical Studies). Their philosophical interest is not to be undervalued. While some of the documents hereunder are full written drafts, others are just elaborate schemes of branches of Aristotelico-Thomistic philosophy.

===Academic talks===

The following written texts are full transcripts of talks read by Pirotta on various occasions at the several academic institutes, both in Malta and in [[Italy]], that he was part of. None of them have ever been published.

===Sermons===

The following texts are the extant sermons that Pirotta read during his pastoral work. All of them have been probably delivered in Malta, even the Italian ones. Roughly speaking, the Italian orations would have been read to diocesan priests or members of religious orders, and the Maltese ones to the general faithful. Though most of them do not contain any philosophical interest, some of them do bear witness to Pirotta‚Äôs philosophical type of mind, even when treating spiritual or religious matters.

====In Italian====

Pirotta‚Äôs extant sermons in Italian are all collected at the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] archives at [[Rabat, Malta]]. Most of the titles are Pirotta‚Äôs own.

==Appreciation==
Pirotta was the last of major philosophers within the school of [[Scholasticism]]. With him, an era of Scholastics, extending back to the latter part of the 16th century, starting with [[John Matthew Rispoli]], came to an end. Today, as philosophy took new shapes and adopted different language-forms, Pirotta might appear almost incomprehensible in his world-view and philosophical method. This is further intensified his consistent use of Latin, a language very few still remember how to use or read.

Though a great speculative thinker, it is somewhat difficult to gauge Pirotta‚Äôs originality. Surely his lack of concrete commitment with things social and political, as any old-time, first division scholastic would be, today makes him suspect of a certain lack of concern for world affairs as for the fate of humans. However, the scholastics had another way of understanding what philosophical service to humankind should be. Arguably, they sought to enlighten the highest (or most profound) aspects of reason, there where the quality of life might be improved and perfected.

Much work is still needed to continue discovering the wealth which philosophers of the calibre of Pirotta possessed.

'''Apollonides''' (fl. 46 BC) was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0246.html|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, page 237 (v. 1)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a friend and companion of [[Cato the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E82oRzHYLhMC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=Apollonides+cato&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x2Z8CTa_NG&amp;sig=kBCOxCL-S5kPZBZNbsr6mdc3fPE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QsEiVJjUJsr3yQSdpoCIBA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Apollonides%20cato&amp;f=false|title=The Philosophers of the Ancient World|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sole record of Apollonides is within [[Plutarch's]] account of Cato the Younger in ''[[Parallel Lives]]''. From this account, there is evidence that after the [[Battle of Thapsus]], Apollonides was present with Cato at [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]]. During this time, Cato ordered a young man named Statyllius to leave Utica. When Statyllius refused, Cato appointed Apollonides and Demetrius  the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] to "reduce this man's swollen pride and restore him to conformity with his best interests."&lt;ref&gt;Plut. ''Cat.'' 65&lt;/ref&gt; When Cato later inquired if Statyllius was sent off, Apollonides responded:
{{quote|text="By no means... although we reasoned much with him; but he is lofty and unbending, and says he will remain and do whatever thou doest."&lt;ref&gt;Plut. ''Cat.'' 66&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In preparation for his [[suicide]], Cato had everyone present leave his side, with the exception of Apollonides and Demetrius.&lt;ref&gt;Plut. ''Cat.'' 69&lt;/ref&gt; Cato's character is emphasized in this choice as "it says a great deal about Cato that he saved his last real conversation for his philosophers, not his son."&lt;ref&gt;Goodman &amp; Soni. ''Rome's Last Citizen: The Life and Legacy of Cato, Mortal Enemy of Caesar,'' p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''{{lang|la|Audi alteram partem}}''' (or '''{{lang|la|audiatur et altera pars}}''') is a [[Latin]] [[List of Latin phrases|phrase]] meaning "listen to the other side", or "let the other side be heard as well".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/audi+alteram+partem audi alteram partem: Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the principle that no person should be judged without a fair hearing in which each party is given the opportunity to respond to the evidence against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/A/Audialterampartem.aspx Audi alteram partem's entry in the duhaime.org legal dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Audi alteram partem" is considered to be a principle of [[fundamental justice]] or [[Equity (law)|equity]] or the principle of natural justice in most [[legal system]]s. This principle includes the rights of a party or his lawyers to confront the [[witness]]es against him, to have a fair opportunity to challenge the [[evidence (law)|evidence]] presented by the other party, to summon one's own witnesses and to present evidence, and to have counsel, if necessary at public expense, in order to make one's case properly.

The phrase has come to be used as the motto for various political and judicial organisations, and is also the origin of the name of the German carmaker [[Audi]].

==History of use==
As a general principle of rationality in reaching conclusions in disputed matters, "Hear both sides" was treated as part of common wisdom by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] dramatists.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Aeschylus]], ''[[The Eumenides]]'' 431, 435&lt;/ref&gt; A similar principle can also be found in Islamic law, based on a [[hadith]] indicating that in litigation, both parties must be heard.&lt;ref&gt; Imam Abu Dawud. 2008. ''Sunan Abu Dawud Vol. 3 (Translated to English by Ahmad Hasan)''. Riyadh: Darussalam,, Hadith No. 3575, Grade: Hasan &lt;/ref&gt; The principle was referred to by the [[International Court of Justice]] in the ''Nuclear Tests'' case, referring to [[France]]'s non-appearance at judgment.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/58/6093.pdf Nuclear Tests (Australia c. France)]'', C. I. J., December 20, 1974, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Modern legal systems differ on whether individuals can be convicted ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]''. The principle is used in [[labour law]] matters in countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe.

==Other uses==

The Political Interest Society of the [[University of Melbourne]] uses the phrase as its motto.&lt;ref&gt;http://umsu.unimelb.edu.au/clubs/political-interest-society/&lt;/ref&gt; The All-Campus Judicial Council of the [[University of Rochester]] has used the phrase as its motto since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://sa.rochester.edu/sa/acjc/&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is also the origin of the name of [[Germany|German]] carmaker [[Audi]]. Founder [[August Horch]] had left his previous company, [[Motorwagenwerke]], after a dispute with partners and founded a new company on 16 July 1909, initially named the ''August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH''. His former partners sued him for trademark infringement, and the German [[Reichsgericht]] (Supreme Court) ruled that the Horch brand belonged to his former company.&lt;ref name="chronicle2"&gt;[http://www.audiusa.com/us/brand/en/about/main/history.html Audi History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209000116/http://www.audiusa.com/us/brand/en/about/main/history.html |date=9 February 2010 }} audiusa.com&lt;/ref&gt; Horch therefore called a meeting with close business friends Paul and Franz Fikentscher, to come up with a new name for the company. During this meeting, Franz's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. Several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working, until he finally blurted out, "Father&amp;nbsp;‚Äì  ''audiatur et altera pars''...&amp;nbsp;wouldn't it be a good idea to call it ''audi'' instead of ''horch''?"&lt;ref&gt;August Horch: "Ich baute Autos ‚Äì Vom Schmiedelehrling zum Autoindustriellen", Sch√ºtzen-Verlag Berlin 1937&lt;/ref&gt; "Horch!" in German means "Hark!" or "hear", which is "Audi" in the singular imperative form of "audire" ‚Äì "to listen" ‚Äì in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting, and the company was registered as ''Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau'' in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Sebastiaan (Bas) Haring''' / '''Prof.dr. S. Haring''' (born 23 April 1968 in [[De Bilt]]) is a [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] [[philosopher]], writer of [[popular science]] and [[children's literature]], [[television presenter]] and [[professor]]. He's a full professor at Leiden University where he holds a chair in ‚Äúpublic understanding of science‚Äù since 2007.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://mediatechnology.leiden.edu/people/staff/bas-haring|title = Haring, Bas - Media Technology MSc Programme - Leiden University|website = mediatechnology.leiden.edu|access-date = 2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/bas-haring|title = Bas Haring - Leiden University|website = Leiden University|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leidenuniv.nl/nieuwsarchief2/1146.html|title=Universiteit Leiden|website=www.leidenuniv.nl|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universiteitvannederland.nl/college/hoe-kun-je-op-de-wc-uitgroeien-tot-groot-filosoof/|title=Hoe kun je op de wc uitgroeien tot groot filosoof? {{!}} Universiteit van Nederland|website=Universiteit van Nederland (Dutch)|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also hosted his own philosophical tv-program for Dutch public broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tvblik.nl/dossier/bas-haring|title=Bas Haring|website=TVblik (Dutch)|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work his aims are to make science more accessible for a general public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Haring tries to make others think about simple and complex issues. To make his questions, positions and point of views clear, he's known for using humor, personal stories, and analogies between animals, people and computers. And his name is like a dutch fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kb.nl/themas/filosofie/bas-haring|title=Bas Haring {{!}} Koninklijke Bibliotheek|website=www.kb.nl (Dutch)|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haring first achieved prominence with his 2001 children's book ''[[Bas Haring#Cheese and the Theory of Evolution|Cheese and the Theory of Evolution]]'' in which he explained [[evolution]] and its implications. The book received several awards and has been translated into ten different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwo.nl/actueel/evenementen/eurekaprijs/eerdere+edities|title=Eerdere edities Eurekaprijs|last=Marianne|website=www.nwo.nl|access-date=2016-03-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309094643/http://www.nwo.nl/actueel/evenementen/eurekaprijs/eerdere+edities|archivedate=2016-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.2015.goudenboekenuil.be/edities|title=Edities {{!}} Gouden Boekenuil|website=www.2015.goudenboekenuil.be|access-date=2016-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310181124/http://www.2015.goudenboekenuil.be/edities|archive-date=2016-03-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheese and the Theory of Evolution (Kaas en de evolutietheorie)''An informative literary jewel''|author=Pjotr van Lenteren|url=http://www.productiefonds.nl/book/book2.php?show=all&amp;book_vertid=2871&amp;Book=129|accessdate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''For a Successful Life'' was published in 2008 by Beautiful Books Limited (UK).

'''[[Swami Vivekananda]]''' (1863‚Äì1902)&lt;ref name="Chaube p52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chaube|2005|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Indian Hindu monk and a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies of [[Vedanta]] and [[Yoga]] to the western world.&lt;ref name="Vivekananda 2006 p11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vivekananda|2006|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary India and the most successful and influential missionaries of Vedanta to the Western world.&lt;ref name="Mohapatra p14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mohapatra|2009|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Piazza p59"&gt;{{Harvnb|Piazza|1978|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Nobel laureate poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s suggested to study the works of Vivekananda to understand India. He also told, in Vivekananda there was nothing negative, but everything positive.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyaya p314" /&gt;

In last one century, hundreds of scholarly books have been written on Vivekananda, his works and his philosophy in different languages. [[Sister Nivedita]], who was a disciple and a friend of Vivekananda, wrote two books ''[[The Master as I Saw Him]]'' and ''[[Notes of some wanderings with the Swami Vivekananda]]''. The first one was published in 1910 and the second one was published in 1913.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyaya p299"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sister Gargi]]'s lifelong research work, a series of six volumes of books, ''[[Swami Vivekananda in the West: New Discoveries]]'' was first published in two volumes in 1957. In 1983-87 these series was republished in six volumes.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyaya p326"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bengali scholar and critic Sankari Prasad Basu, who was a director of Swami Vivekananda Archives, [[Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture]] wrote several books on Vivekananda such as ''Vivekananda o Samakalin Bharatbarsha'' ({{Bn icon}} 7 volumes), ''Sahasya Vivekananda'' {{Bn icon}}, ''Bandhu Vivekananda'' {{Bn icon}} etc.&lt;ref name="Dutt p121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dutt|1999|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monks of Ramakrishna Math and Mission too have written several notable books on the life and works of Vivekananda. ''Swami Vivekananda and Modern India'' written by Swami Jagadiswarananda was first published in 1941. In this book the author covered the biography of Vivekananda in brief.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyaya p314"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swami Nikhilananda]] wrote ''Vivekananda: A Biography'' which was first published in 1943 from [[Advaita Ashrama]].&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyaya p316"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yuganayak Vivekananda'' {{Bn icon}}, written by [[Swami Gambhirananda]] was first published in 1966‚Äì1967.&lt;ref name="Chattopadhyaya p326" /&gt;

[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Modern groups of animals can be grouped by the arrangement of their body structures, so are said to possess different body plans.]]

A '''body plan''', '''''Bauplan''''' (German plural '''''Baupl√§ne'''''), or '''ground plan''' is a set of morphological features common to many members of a [[phylum]] of [[animal]]s.&lt;ref name=Valentine2004&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Valentine |first1=James W. |title=On the Origin of Phyla |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMBkmHm5fe4C |isbn=978-0226845487 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vertebrate body plan is one of many: invertebrates consist of many phyla.

This term, usually applied to animals, envisages a "blueprint" encompassing aspects such as [[symmetry (biology)|symmetry]], [[segmentation (biology)|segmentation]] and [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] disposition. [[Evolutionary developmental biology]] seeks to explain the origins of diverse body plans.

Body plans have historically been considered to have evolved in a flash in the [[Cambrian explosion]], but a more nuanced understanding of animal evolution suggests gradual development of body plans throughout the early [[Palaeozoic]].

==History==
The history of the discovery of body plans can be seen as a movement from a worldview centred on the [[vertebrates]], to seeing the vertebrates (or [[chordate]]s) as one [[phylum]]'s body plan among many. Among the pioneering [[zoologist]]s, Linnaeus identified two body plans outside the vertebrates; Cuvier identified three; and Haeckel had four, as well as the Protista with eight more, for a total of twelve. For comparison, the number of phyla recognised by modern zoologists has risen to 36.&lt;ref name=Valentine2004/&gt;

===Linnaeus, 1735===
&lt;!---[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|200px|right|[[Linnaeus]]'s table of the Animal Kingdom (''{{lang|la|Regnum Animale}}'') in ''[[Systema Naturae|Systema Natur√¶]]'' (1735)]]---&gt;
In his 1735 book, ''[[Systema Naturae|Systema Natur√¶]]'', the Swedish [[botanist]] [[Linnaeus]] grouped the animals into [[quadrupeds]], [[birds]], "amphibians" (including [[tortoises]], [[lizards]] and [[snakes]]), [[fish]], "insects" (Insecta, in which he included [[arachnids]], [[crustaceans]] and [[centipedes]]) and "worms" (Vermes). Linnaeus's Vermes included effectively all other groups of animals, not only [[tapeworms]], [[earthworms]] and [[leeches]] but [[molluscs]], [[sea urchins]] and [[starfish]], [[jellyfish]], [[squid]] and [[cuttlefish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Linnaeus |first=Carolus |year=1735 |title=Systema naturae, sive regna tria naturae systematice proposita per classes, ordines, genera, &amp; species |pages=1‚Äì12 |location=Leiden |publisher=Haak |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/15373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuvier, 1817===
[[File:Haeckel arbol bn.png|thumb|200px|right|[[Haeckel]]'s 'Monophyletischer Stambaum der Organismen' from ''Generelle Morphologie der Organismen'' (1866) with the three branches [[Plantae]], [[Protista]], [[Animalia]]]]
In his 1817 work, ''Le R√®gne Animal'', the French zoologist [[Georges Cuvier]] combined evidence from comparative anatomy and [[palaeontology]]&lt;ref name="Reiss2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reiss |first=John |title=Not by Design: Retiring Darwin's Watchmaker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5bMCUU0tP0C&amp;pg=PA108 |year=2009 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-94440-4 |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; to divide the animal kingdom into four body plans. Taking the [[central nervous system]] as the main organ system which controlled all the others, such as the circulatory and digestive systems, Cuvier distinguished four body plans or ''embranchements'':&lt;ref name=DeWit&gt;De Wit, Hendrik Cornelius Dirk De Wit. ''Histoire du D√©veloppement de la Biologie'', Volume III, Presses Polytechniques et Universitaires Romandes, Lausanne, 1994, p. 94-96. {{ISBN|2-88074-264-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* I. with a brain and a spinal cord (surrounded by skeletal elements)&lt;ref name=DeWit/&gt;
* II. with organs linked by nerve fibres&lt;ref name=DeWit/&gt;
* III. with two longitudinal, ventral nerve cords linked by a band with two ganglia below the oesophagus&lt;ref name=DeWit/&gt;
* IV. with a diffuse nervous system, not clearly discernible&lt;ref name=DeWit/&gt;

Grouping animals with these body plans resulted in four branches: [[vertebrates]], [[molluscs]], [[articulata hypothesis|articulata]] (including [[insects]] and [[annelids]]) and zoophytes or [[radiata]].

===Haeckel, 1866===
[[Ernst Haeckel]], in his 1866 ''Generelle Morphologie der Organismen'', asserted that all living things were [[monophyletic]] (had a single evolutionary origin), being divided into plants, protista, and animals. His protista were divided into moneres, protoplasts, flagellates, diatoms, myxomycetes, myxocystodes, rhizopods, and sponges. His animals were divided into groups with distinct body plans: he named these [[phylum|phyla]]. Haeckel's animal phyla were [[coelenterates]], [[echinoderms]], and (following Cuvier) articulates, molluscs, and vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Haeckel, Ernst. ''Generelle Morphologie der Organismen : allgemeine Grundz√ºge der organischen Formen-Wissenschaft, mechanisch begr√ºndet durch die von Charles Darwin reformirte Descendenz-Theorie.'' (1866) Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gould, 1979===

[[Stephen J. Gould]] explored the idea that the different phyla could be perceived in terms of a Bauplan, illustrating their fixity. However, he later abandoned this idea in favor of [[punctuated equilibrium]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. (2009). ''Evolution: the History of an Idea''. California, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
20 out of the 36 body plans originated in the [[Cambrian]] period,&lt;ref name=AmSci&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erwin |first1=Douglas |last2=Valentine |first2=James |last3=Jablonski |first3=David|title=Recent fossil finds and new insights into animal development are providing fresh perspectives on the riddle of the explosion of animals during the Early Cambrian |journal=American Scientist |date=1997 |issue=March‚ÄìApril |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/num2/the-origin-of-animal-body-plans/3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the "[[Cambrian explosion]]",&lt;ref name="Erwin1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Erwin | first1 = D.

 |last1=Budd |first1=G. E.

 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.1999.tb00046.x
 |pmid=10881389
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current range of body plans is far from exhaustive of the possible patterns for life: the [[Precambrian]] [[Ediacara biota|Ediacaran biota]] includes body plans that differ from any found in currently living organisms, even though the overall arrangement of unrelated modern taxa is quite similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Antcliffe | first1 = J. B.| last2 = Brasier | first2 = M. D.| title = Charnia and sea pens are poles apart| journal = Journal of the Geological Society| volume = 164| pages = 49| year = 2007| doi = 10.1144/0016-76492006-080| url = https://oxford.academia.edu/MartinBrasier/Papers/416927/Charnia_and_Sea_Pens_Are_Poles_Apart&lt;!--free access--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Cambrian explosion appears to have more or less completely replaced the earlier range of body plans.&lt;ref name=AmSci/&gt;

== Genetic basis ==
{{further|evolutionary developmental biology|morphogenesis}}

[[Gene]]s, [[embryo]]s and development together determine the form of an adult organism's body, through the complex switching processes involved in [[morphogenesis]].

Developmental biologists seek to understand how genes control the development of structural features through a cascade of processes in which key genes produce [[morphogen]]s, chemicals that diffuse through the body to produce a gradient that acts as a position indicator for cells, turning on other genes, some of which in turn produce other morphogens. A key discovery was the existence of groups of [[homeobox|homeobox genes]], which function as switches responsible for laying down the basic body plan in animals. The homeobox genes are remarkably conserved between species as diverse as the fruit fly and humans, the basic segmented pattern of the worm or fruit fly being the origin of the segmented spine in humans. The field of animal [[evolutionary developmental biology]] ('Evo Devo'), which studies the genetics of [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] in detail, is rapidly expanding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=0005D708-2F7C-123B-AF7C83414B7F0000 | title=Evo Devo is the New Buzzword... | author=Hall, Brian K. | date=28 March 2005 | accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many of the developmental genetic cascades, particularly in the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila]]'', catalogued in considerable detail.&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arthur |first=Wallace. |authorlink=Wallace Arthur |year=1997 |title=Animal Body Plans |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge England|isbn=0-521-77928-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Breaking Open the Head: A Psychedelic Journey into the Heart of Contemporary Shamanism''''' is a book written by author and journalist [[Daniel Pinchbeck]], founding editor of the literary journal ''Open City''.  Published in 2002, ''Breaking Open the Head'' covers, in Pinchbeck's words, the cultural history of [[psychedelics|psychedelic]] use, philosophical and critical perspectives on [[shamanism]], and his personal transformation from a cynical New York [[litterateur]] to psychedelic acolyte.

Pinchbeck details his initiation with the [[Bwiti]] and their use of [[iboga]]. The account remains personal with Pinchbeck crediting the experience with an insight into his reliance on alcohol.

'''Co-sleeping''' is a practice in which babies and young [[child]]ren [[sleep]] close to one or both [[parenting|parents]], as opposed to in a separate room. Co-sleeping individuals sleep in sensory proximity to one another, where the individual senses the presence of others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cosleeping.nd.edu/videos/|title = Television and Documentary Videos|date = 2005|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = McKenna (speaker)|first = J}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sensory proximity can either be triggered by touch, smell, taste, or noise. Therefore, the individuals can be a few centimeters away or on the other side of the room and still have an effect on the other.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is standard practice in many parts of the world, and is practiced by a significant minority in countries where cribs are also used.

'''Bed-sharing''', a practice in which babies and young children sleep in the same bed with one or both parents, is a subset of co-sleeping. Co-bedding refers to infants (typically twins or higher-order multiples) sharing the same bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lifespan development: A chronological approach|last = Hoffnung|first = M|publisher = |isbn = |location = Milton, Qld|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are conflicting views on bed-sharing [[#Safety and health|safety and health]] compared to using a separate infant bed.

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] does encourage room-sharing (sleeping in the same room but on separate surfaces) in its policy statement regarding [[sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]] prevention, but it recommends against bed-sharing with infants.&lt;ref name="pediatrics.aappublications.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/128/5/1030.abstract?sid=ffa523b4-9b5d-492c-a3d1-80de22504e1d| title= SIDS and Other Sleep-Related Infant Deaths: Expansion of Recommendations for a Safe Infant Sleeping Environment | accessdate= 16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp, James S. 2000"&gt;Kemp, James S. et al. (2000) [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/106/3/e41 Unsafe Sleep Practices and an Analysis of Bedsharing Among Infants Dying Suddenly and Unexpectedly]: Results of a Four-Year, Population-Based, Death-Scene Investigation Study of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Related Deaths.

Recent legal rulings suggest that bed-sharing has been attributed as a factor of unintentional infant suffocation. For instance, parents under the influence of drugs or alcohol and whose children died while bed-sharing have been charged and, at times, prosecuted with manslaughter&lt;ref name = murder/&gt; in several US states (including Minnesota,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drunk father rolled on top of his 7-week-old baby boy and killed him after a night drinking to celebrate his anniversary|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2573503/Drunk-father-rolled-7-week-old-baby-boy-suffocated-night-drinking-celebrate-anniversary.html|accessdate=20 December 2017|publisher=Daily Mail|date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michigan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mich.

==Introduction==
[[File:Zeichnung Schlafen ElmarErsch.jpg|thumb|right|A child lies in the arms of his father.]]
Bed-sharing is standard practice in many parts of the world outside of [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], and even in the latter areas a significant minority of children have shared a bed with their parents at some point in childhood. One 2006 study of children age 3‚Äì10 in [[India]] reported 93% of children bed-sharing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Malhi|first2=P|last3=Kashyap|first3=S|year=2006|title=Patterns and problems of sleep in school going children|journal=Indian pediatrics|volume=43|issue=1|pages=35‚Äì8|pmid=16465004|author1=Bharti|first1=B}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 2006 study of children in [[Kentucky]] in the [[United States]] reported 15% of [[infants]] and [[toddlers]] 2 weeks to 2 years engage in bed-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Gozal|first2=D|year=2006|title=Sleep habits and risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing in infants and young toddlers in Louisville, Kentucky|journal=Sleep Medicine|volume=7|issue=3|pages=211‚Äì9|doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2005.11.003|pmid=16564742|author1=Montgomery-Downs|first1=H. E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bed-sharing was widely practiced in all areas up to the 19th century, until the advent of giving the child his or her own room and the [[cot (furniture)|crib]]. In many parts of the world, bed-sharing simply has the practical benefit of keeping the child warm at night. Bed-sharing has been relatively recently re-introduced into Western culture by practitioners of [[attachment parenting]]. Proponents hold that bed-sharing saves babies' lives (especially in conjunction with [[breastfeeding|nursing]]),
&lt;ref name="McKennaSIDS"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2005|title=Why babies should never sleep alone: A review of the co-sleeping controversy in relation to SIDS, bed sharing, and breastfeeding|url=http://www.naturalchild.org/james_mckenna/cosleeping.pdf|journal=Paediatric Respiratory Reviews|volume=6|issue=2|pages=134‚Äì152|doi=10.1016/j.prrv.2005.03.006|pmid=15911459|author1=McKenna, J.|author2=T.

Older babies can breastfeed during the night without waking their mother. Opponents argue that co-sleeping is stressful for the child when they are not co-sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Gozal|first2=D|year=2006|title=Sleep habits and risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing in infants and young toddlers in Louisville, Kentucky|journal=Sleep Medicine|volume=7|issue=3|pages=211‚Äì9|doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2005.11.003|pmid=16564742|author1=Montgomery-Downs|first1=H. E.}}&lt;!-- For controls lacking on evaluators, please do not reuse this.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They also cite concerns that a parent may [[Asphyxia#Smothering|smother]] the child&lt;ref name="CPSC"&gt;[http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/PRHTML99/99175.html Consumer Product Safety Commission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618130458/http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PREREL/PRHTML99/99175.html |date=June 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or promote an unhealthy dependence of the child on the parent(s). In addition, they contend that this practice may interfere with the parents' own [[intimate relationship|relationship]], by reducing both [[communication]] and [[sexual intercourse]] at bedtime, and argue that modern-day [[bedding]] is not safe for co-bedding.{{clarify-inline|reason=Above co-bedding is defined as separate from bed-sharing, is that sense intended here?|date=August 2018}}

Because children become accustomed to behaviors learned in early experiences, bed-sharing in infancy will also increase the likelihood of these children to crawl into their parent's bed in ages past infancy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span, Second Edition|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = 1464172056|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety and health==
Health care professionals disagree about bed-sharing techniques, effectiveness and ethics.&lt;ref name="Mace"&gt;Mace, S. Where should babies sleep? Community Pract. 2006 Jun; 79(6):180‚Äì3.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]&lt;ref name="CPSC"/&gt; and the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]&lt;ref name="pediatrics.aappublications.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp, James S. 2000"/&gt; strongly discourage bed-sharing because of the risk of suffocation or strangulation, but some pediatricians and breast-feeding advocates have opposed this position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=51747 MedicineNet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
One study reported mothers getting more sleep and breast-feeding by co-sleeping than other arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Quillin, S.I. Interaction between feeding method and co-sleeping on maternal-newborn sleep. J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs. 2004 Sep‚ÄìOct; 33(5):580‚Äì8.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents also experience less exhaustion with such ease in feeding and comforting their child by simply reaching over to the child. As a result, co-sleeping also increases the responsiveness of parents to their child's needs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It has been argued that co-sleeping evolved over five million years, that it alters the infant's sleep experience and the number of maternal inspections of the infant, and that it provides a beginning point for considering possibly unconventional ways of helping reduce the risk of [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS).&lt;ref name="McKennaSIDS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=McKenna/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKenna, J. Experimental studies of infant-parent co-sleeping: mutual physiological and behavioral influences and their relevance to SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). Early Hum Dev. 1994 Sep 15; 38(3):187‚Äì201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stress hormones are lower in mothers and babies who co-sleep, specifically the balance of the stress hormone cortisol, the control of which is essential for a baby's healthy growth.&lt;ref&gt;Hofer, M. "The mother-infant interactionas a regulator of infant physiology and behavior", ''Sympiosis in Parent-Offspring Interactions'', New York: Plenum, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofer | first1 = M. | title = Some thoughts on the tranduction of experience from a developmental perspective | url = | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 44 | issue = 19| page = 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shair|first2=H.|title=Control of sleep-wake states in the infant rat, by features of the mother-infant relationship|url=|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|volume=15|issue=|pages=229‚Äì243|last1=Hofer|first1=M.|name-list-format=vanc|doi=10.1002/dev.420150307}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies with animals, infants who stayed close to their mothers had higher levels of growth hormones and enzymes necessary for brain and heart growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Suskind|first2=M.|last3=Schanberg|first3=S.|year=1978|title=Maternal behavior as a regulator of polyamine biosynthesis in brain and heart of developing rat pups|url=|journal=Science|volume=199|issue=4327|pages=445‚Äì447|doi=10.1126/science.202031|pmid=202031|last1=Butler|first1=S.R.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Butler|last3=Schanberg|first3=S.|year=1978|title=Selective depression of serum growth hormone during maternal deprivation in rat pups|url=|journal=Science|volume=201|issue=4360|pages=1035‚Äì1036|doi=10.1126/science.684424|last1=Kuhn|first1=C.M.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the physiology of co-sleeping babies is more stable, including more stable temperatures, more regular heart rhythms, and fewer long pauses in breathing than babies who sleep alone.&lt;ref&gt;Field, T. ''Touch in early development'', N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum and Assoc., 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reite, M. and J.P. Capitanio. "On the nature of social separation and social attachment", ''The psychobiology of attachment and separation, New York: Academic Press, 1985, p. 228‚Äì238''&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides physical developmental advantages, co-sleeping may also promote long-term emotional health. In long-term follow-up studies of infants who slept with their parents and those who slept alone, the children who co-slept were happier, less anxious, had higher self-esteem, were less likely to be afraid of sleep, had fewer behavioral problems, tended to be more comfortable with intimacy, and were generally more independent as adults.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, M.

Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposing arguments and precautions===
Some parents pose threats to infants due to their behaviors and conditions, such as smoking or drinking heavily, taking drugs, a history of skin infections, obesity, or any other specific risk-increasing traits.&lt;ref name=Mace/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, there are certain dangerous behaviors that increase SIDS and should be avoided whether placing a baby in a crib or co-sleeping: infants should always sleep on their backs on a firm surface (not waterbeds, pillows, recliners, or couches), mattresses should intersect the bedframe tightly, there should be no stuffed animals or soft toys near the baby, blankets should be light, a baby's head should never be covered, and other SIDS risk factors should be avoided.&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;[http://cosleeping.nd.edu/safe-co-sleeping-guidelines/ McKenna, James, "Safe Co-Sleeping Guidelines"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-sleeping deaths in [[Texas]] reached at least 182 in the 2013-2014 fiscal year, which ends on August 31, compared to 169 in the 2012-2013 period. Nearly all of the infants who died were under the age of one year. John Lennan, a spokesman for [[Webb County, Texas|Webb County]] child protective services in [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], said that each family's situation is examined individually to offer recommendations for a safe environment for the children. The key to such sleeping arrangements is to make sure that the infant has room to breathe while sleeping, he added.&lt;ref&gt;Cesar G. Rodriguez, "Infant deaths" Co-sleeping tragedies rise, ''[[Laredo Morning Times]]'', August 10, 2014, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-sleeping also increases the risks of suffocation and strangulation. The soft quality of the mattresses, comforters, and pillows may suffocate the infants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some experts, then, recommend that the [[bed (furniture)|bed]] should be firm, and should not be a [[waterbed]] or [[couch]]; and that heavy [[quilt]]s, comforters, and [[pillow]]s should not be used. Another common advice given to prevent suffocation is to keep a baby on its back, not its stomach.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=51747 MedicineNet.com] [http://iparenting.com/sears/columns/co-sleep.htm IParenting.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623171312/http://iparenting.com/sears/columns/co-sleep.htm |date=2006-06-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents who roll over during their sleep could inadvertently crush and/or suffocate their child, especially if they are heavy sleepers, over-tired or over-exhausted and/or obese.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is also the risk of the baby falling to a hard floor, or getting wedged between the bed and the wall or headboard. A proposed solution to these problems is the bedside bassinet, in which, rather than bed-sharing, the baby's bed is placed next to the parent's bed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The presence of the child in the parent's bedroom also raises the concern of a lack of privacy between the parents and the child. The lack of privacy may result in increased tension and reduced intimacy between a couple.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another precaution recommended by experts is that young children should never sleep next to babies under nine months of age.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, William MD et al. ''The Baby Sleep Book'', Brown, Little &amp; Company, 2005, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 report explored the relationship between ad hoc parental behaviors similar to traditional co-sleeping methodology, though the study's subjects typically utilized cribs and other paraphernalia counter to co-sleeping models. While babies who had been exposed to behaviors reminiscent of co-sleeping had significant problems with sleep later in life, the study concluded that the parental behaviors were a reaction to already-present sleep difficulties. Most relationships between parental behavior and sleeping trouble were not statistically significant when controlled for those preexisting conditions. Further, typical co-sleeping parental behavior, like maternal presence at onset of sleep, were found to be protective factors against sleep problems.&lt;ref&gt;Simard, V., et al. (2008).

===Association with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)===
Co-sleeping can often be regarded as an unnecessary practice that can be associated with issues such as [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=A|date=2009|title=SIDS: Past, present and future.|url=|journal=Acta Paediatr|volume=98|pages=1712‚Äì9|doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2009.01503.x|pmid=19807704|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alm|first=B|date=2007|title=To co-sleep or not to sleep|url=|journal=Acta Paediatrica|volume=96|pages=1385‚Äì1386|doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2007.00524.x|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research shows that opinions vary in the association between SIDS and co-sleeping.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schluter, Paterson, Percival|date=2007|title=Infant care practices associated with sudden infant death syndrome: Findings from the pacific islands families study|url=|journal=Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health|volume=43|pages=388‚Äì393|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1754.2007.01085.x|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most controversial issue regarding SIDS is whether bed sharing is a main cause, and whether it should be avoided or encouraged.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Research indicates that co-sleeping, particularly bed sharing should be avoided as it increases the risk of SIDS.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Controversially, research shows that if co-sleeping practices are done in an appropriate and safe manner it can be very beneficial and reduce risk of SIDS occurring.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Pacific Islands Families study, conducted in New Zealand, showed that the adoption of safe bed-sharing and room-sharing practices were saving infant lives and that there was no infant that died from SIDS.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Products for infants===
There are several products that can be used to facilitate safe co-sleeping with an infant:
* special-purpose bedside [[bassinet]]s, sidecar sleepers and [[bedside sleeper]]s, which attach directly to the side of an adult bed and are open to the parent's side, but have barriers on the other three sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Co-sleeping, an ancient practice: issues of the past and present, and possibilities for the future|url=|journal=Sleep Med. Rev.|volume=10|issue=6|pages=407‚Äì17|doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2005.12.001|pmid=17112752|last1=Thoman|first1=E.B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* bed top co-sleeping products designed to prevent the baby from rolling off the adult bed and to absorb breastmilk and other nighttime leaks.
* side rails to prevent the child from rolling off the adult bed.
* co-sleeping infant enclosures which are placed directly in the adult bed.
* specially designed separate sleeping bags for parents and infants which prevent covers being inadvertently pulled over the baby's head.
* wahakura : A simple woven basket that allows babies to safely sleep in the same bed as parents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/308319/researcher-sure-pepi-pods-save-lives&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
A study of a small population in [[Northeast England]] showed a variety of nighttime parenting strategies and that 65% of the sample had bed-shared, 95% of them having done so with both parents. The study reported that some of the parents found bedsharing effective, yet were covert in their practices, fearing disapproval of health professionals and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Hooker, F. Sleeping like a baby: attitudes and experiences of bedsharing in northeast England. Med Anthropol. 2001; 19(3):203‚Äì22.&lt;/ref&gt; A National Center for Health Statistics survey from 1991 to 1999 found that 25% of American families always, or almost always, slept with their baby in bed, 42% slept with their baby sometimes, and 32% never bed-shared with their baby.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, William MD et al. ''ibid'', p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socioeconomic factors===
Initial assumptions on co-sleeping may place it in a context of income and socioeconomic status. Generally, families of low socioeconomic status will be unable to afford a separate room for a child while those of high socioeconomic status can more easily afford a home with a sufficient number of rooms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, statistical data shows the prevalence of co-sleeping in wealthy Japanese families and the ability of poor Western families to still find a separate space for their child, suggests that the acceptance of co-sleeping is a result of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sleep characteristics of young children in Japan: Internet study and comparison with other Asian countries|last = Kohyama|first = Jun|date = 2011|journal = Pediatrics International|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |last2 = Mindell|first2 = Jodi|last3 = Sadeh|first3 = Avi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural factors===
Several studies show that the prevalence of co-sleeping is a result of cultural preference. In a study of 19 nations, a trend emerged, depicting a widely accepted practice of co-sleeping in Asian, African, and Latin American countries, while European and North American countries rarely practiced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cross-cultural differences in infant and toddler sleep|last = Mindell|first = Jodi A.|date = 2010|journal = Sleep Medicine|accessdate = |doi = 10.1016/j.sleep.2009.04.012 |last2 = Sadeh|first2 = Avi |volume=11 |pages=274‚Äì280}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend resulted mostly from the respective fears of parents: Asian, African, and Latin American parents worried about the separation between the parents and the child, while European and North American parents feared a lack of privacy for both the parents and the child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Delia Steinberg''' studied music from an early age and, at the age of 17, graduated from the National Conservatory of Music in Buenos Aires as Teacher of [[Piano]] and [[Musical composition|Composition]]. She then continued her studies under the Argentine concert [[pianist]] [[Flora Nudelman]], and later with the Russian master Hubert Brandenburg. Nudelman herself had been a pupil of [[Jorge Lalewicz]], who had studied under [[Anatoly Lyadov]] and [[Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].

She completed her studies with a master's degree in [[Philosophy]] from the [[University of Buenos Aires]], and took specialist courses in [[Archaeology]] and [[History]], exact sciences, journalism and advertising.

In 1972 she became the Director of [[New Acropolis]] in [[Spain]] and, since the death of its founder and first international director, [[Jorge Livraga]], in 1991, she has been the international president of the organization.

In 1982 she founded the '''New Acropolis International Piano Competition''', which has been held annually in [[Madrid]] (Spain),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concursopianodeliasteinberg.org/?p=49 Trump 32 ¬∫ International Contest of Piano Delia Steinberg 2013], consulted on  June 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 was renamed the [[International Competition of Piano Delia Steinberg|Delia Steinberg International Piano Competition]].

'''''Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy''''' (and a later edition published as '''''Dezinformatsia: The Strategy of Soviet Disinformation''''') is a non-fiction book about [[disinformation]] and [[information warfare]] used by the [[KGB]] during the [[Soviet Union]] period, as part of their [[active measures]] tactics. The book was co-authored by [[Richard H. Shultz]], professor of international politics at [[Tufts University]], and [[Roy Godson]], professor emeritus of government at [[Georgetown University]].

Shultz and Godson discuss Soviet disinformation tactics including injection of [[Communist propaganda]] through covert groups within the [[U.S.S.R.]] tasked with disrupting activities of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and the U.S. The book explains disinformation methods including [[forgery as covert operation]], [[agents of influence]], and using [[social influence]] to turn targets into [[useful idiot]]s. They focus on disinformation activities of Soviet intelligence from 1960 to 1980. Shultz and Godson discuss case studies as examples of Soviet disinformation, including a French journalist covertly financed by Russian agents in order to publish biased material against Western interests, and the [[front organization]] activities of the [[World Peace Council]]. They back up their analyses with two Soviet intelligence [[defection|defectors]].

''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' called the book a "useful survey" of how Soviet intelligence used disinformation "to further its strategic aims such as discrediting America and weakening NATO".&lt;ref name=campbell /&gt; ''The Journal of Conflict Studies'' described it as "a useful introduction to a field of knowledge" of importance to security experts, the [[United States Intelligence Community]], and diplomats.&lt;ref name=charters /&gt; ''[[Society (journal)|Society]]'' called ''Dezinformatsia'', "a highly readable and insightful book".&lt;ref name=society /&gt; ''[[Political Science Quarterly]]'' gave the work a negative review, criticizing the book's writing style and methodological rigor.&lt;ref name=psq /&gt;

== Contents summary ==
[[File:Disinformation- A Primer in Russian Active Measures and Influence.pdf|thumb|upright|left|Roy Godson's 2017 testimony to the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], drawing from his book ''Dezinformatsia'']]
''Dezinformatsia'' describes [[disinformation]] tactics used by the intelligence services of the [[Soviet Union]] including the [[KGB]], against foreign enemies including the United States. The authors define disinformation as: "false, incomplete, or misleading information that is passed, fed, or confirmed to a targeted individual, group, or country."&lt;ref name=jowett&gt;{{citation|author1=Garth Jowett  |author2=Victoria O'Donnell|title=Propaganda and Persuasion|pages=21‚Äì23|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-0898-6|year=2005|chapter=What Is Propaganda, and How Does It Differ From Persuasion?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book explains the covert groups within the [[Soviet Union]] tasked with disrupting government activities of the countries belonging to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], and the U.S., through injection of [[Communist propaganda]].&lt;ref name=charters /&gt; The authors place the Soviet policy of [[active measures]] within a broader strategy of [[Russian military deception]] in favor of domestic [[national security]].&lt;ref name=charters /&gt; They focus their discussion on disinformation conducted by the Soviet intelligence between the period of 1960‚Äì1980.&lt;ref name=charters /&gt;&lt;ref name=society /&gt;&lt;ref name=psq /&gt;

Shultz and Godson note that manipulated groups involve both official departments of the Soviet state, as well as [[non-governmental organization]]s which lack independence from the state control itself. Specific goals exported by covert Soviet government channels and groups in the [[Western world]] were financed by Soviet intelligence operations. These covert operations were coordinated so as to have maximum impact related to major international incidents.&lt;ref name=charters /&gt;&lt;ref name=society /&gt;&lt;ref name=psq /&gt;

[[File:Disinformation vs Misinformation.jpg|thumb|300px|Graphic showing differences between disinformation, [[misinformation]] and [[hoax]].&lt;br /&gt;(Wikimedia Foundation presentation)]]
As a case study of disinformation, the authors describe journalist {{illm|Pierre-Charles Path√©|lt=Pierre-Charles Path√©|fr|Pierre-Charles Path√©}}, whose publication in France was secretly financed by Soviet intelligence. Its contents were biased against the Western world in favor of the Soviet agenda, and had considerable impact on public opinion. In another example, the authors bring forth an analysis of the [[World Peace Council]], which operated as a [[front organization]] for Soviet intelligence. They discuss its operations negatively impacting both NATO and the U.S. Shultz and Godson back up their analyses with interviews from two Soviet officials who had [[defection|defected]] from their posts in Soviet intelligence, and spoke of disinformation campaigns against Western interests.&lt;ref name=charters /&gt;&lt;ref name=society /&gt;&lt;ref name=psq /&gt;

The authors detail commonly used disinformation tactics by the Soviet intelligence agencies, including [[forgery as covert operation]] in order to fool target dupes into believing such fabricated documents were real. Additionally, the writers explain how Soviet [[secret agent|covert spies]] were able to bring [[agents of influence]] into their fold and do their bidding, whether knowingly or through [[social influence]] as a [[useful idiot]].&lt;ref name=charters /&gt;&lt;ref name=society /&gt;&lt;ref name=psq /&gt;

Shultz and Godson note that after the Soviet term ''dezinformatsia'' became widely known in the 1980s in the English language as ''disinformation'', native speakers of English broadened the term as "any government communication (either overt or covert) containing intentionally false and misleading material, often combined selectively with true information, which seeks to mislead and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] either elites or a mass audience."&lt;ref name=charters /&gt;&lt;ref name=society /&gt;&lt;ref name=psq /&gt;

== Release and reception ==
''Dezinformatsia'' was released in a paperback edition in 1984.&lt;ref name=shultz1984&gt;{{citation|title=Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy|year=1984|first1=Richard H.|last1=Shultz|first2=Roy|last2=Godson|publisher=Pergamon-Brassey's|isbn=978-0-08-031573-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{oclc|299387801}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was issued again in paperback in 1986 under the same title,&lt;ref name=shultz1986&gt;{{citation|title=Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy|year=1986|first1=Richard H.|last1=Shultz|first2=Roy|last2=Godson|publisher=Berkley|isbn=978-0-425-08772-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{oclc|493594237}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also with the different title ‚Äî ''Dezinformatsia: The Strategy of Soviet Disinformation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Dezinformatsia: The Strategy of Soviet Disinformation|year=1986|first1=Richard H.|last1=Shultz|first2=Roy|last2=Godson|publisher=Berkley Books|isbn=978-0-425-08772-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John C. Campbell reviewed the book for the journal ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', and wrote: "The Shultz/Godson book is a useful survey of how the Soviet Union uses 'disinformation,' propaganda, agents, covert political techniques and front organizations to influence events in foreign countries and to further its strategic aims such as discrediting America and weakening NATO."&lt;ref name=campbell&gt;{{citation|oclc=5546902158|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1984-09-01/dezinformatsia-active-measures-soviet-strategy-new-lies-old|journal=[[Foreign Affairs]]|date=September 1, 1984|first=John C.|last=Campbell|title=Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy|volume=63|issue=1|issn=0015-7120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell criticized the dry nature of some of the facts revealed in the book, "Parts of the presentation are novel, but the revelations are not particularly sensational."&lt;ref name=campbell /&gt; Campbell concluded stories in the book should not be taken at face value, "The author's KGB experience and background doubtless give him a special vantage point, but most of this story can be taken with several grains of salt."&lt;ref name=campbell /&gt;

Writing in ''Conflict Quarterly'' for ''The Journal of Conflict Studies'', David Charters questioned why the book did not present more of an analysis on the aggregate impact of all of the disinformation campaigns, before noting such a task would be difficult to assess.&lt;ref name=charters&gt;{{citation|first=David|last=Charters|volume=5|issue=4|year=1985|title=Richard H. Shultz and Roy Godson, Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy|journal=Conflict Quarterly|page=79|url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/JCS/article/view/14695/15764|oclc=5127078304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer asked why the book did not fully address questions including, "Did any of the forgeries described have a significant political impact on the intended target, and on U.S. relations with the country concerned, or were they merely of nuisance value?"&lt;ref name=charters /&gt; ''Conflict Quarterly'' criticized such absence in the book and identified it as an academic deficiency, writing, "Without answers to questions such as these, it is difficult to accept, at face value, the authors' conclusions."&lt;ref name=charters /&gt; Charters concluded the book was "a useful introduction to a field of knowledge which&amp;nbsp;... is likely to continue to expand in importance for diplomats, the intelligence community, and scholars of international security affairs.&lt;ref name=charters /&gt;

Stephen Sloan reviewed the book for the journal ''[[Society (journal)|Society]]'', writing: "Richard H. Shultz and Roy Godson are to be credited for writing a highly readable and insightful book that can enable policy-makers, academics, and concerned members of the public to understand a form of political warfare that until recently was only rarely recognized in the West."&lt;ref name=society&gt;{{citation|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/10867920/dezinformatsia-active-measures-soviet-strategy-book|journal=[[Society (journal)|Society]]|title=Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy|last=Sloan|first=Stephen|date=January 1985|volume=22|issue=2|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the work "ground breaking research".&lt;ref name=society /&gt; Sloan concluded, "Shultz and Godson have provided an awareness of a threat that should be acted upon."&lt;ref name=society /&gt;

''[[Political Science Quarterly]]'' gave a more critical assessment of the book, with reviewer Ellen Mickiewicz commenting, "In the second chapter, the discussion of the organization of Soviet foreign propaganda activities is so fuzzy as to be confusing."&lt;ref name=psq&gt;{{citation|title=Review ‚Äì Reviewed Work(s): Dezinfomatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy. by Richard H.

'''Emilio Betti''' ([[Camerino]], 20 August 1890 ‚Äì [[Camorciano di Camerino]], 11 August 1968) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[jurist]], [[Roman Law]] scholar, [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]]. He is best known for his contributions to [[hermeneutics]], part of a broad interest in interpretation. As a legal theorist, Betti is close to [[Interpretivism (legal)|interpretivism]].

Betti's intellectual support of [[fascism]] between the end of [[World War I]] and the beginning of the 1920s led him to be arrested in 1944, in Camerino. Betti remained in prison for about a month, as decided by the [[Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale]]. In August 1945, Betti was presented to court and absolved of every accusation.

His political choices, anyway, have not diminished the value and importance of his work. Between many other things, Betti was one of the members of the drafting commission for the Italian [[civil code]] of 1942.

Betti is perhaps best known for his work in [[hermeneutics]]. He took issue with the hermeneutic views of [[Hans Georg Gadamer]] and argued that interpreters should attempt to reconstruct the author's intentions. His work influenced the work of [[E. D. Hirsch]], the chief English-language spokesman for authorial intention. However, his influence in English has been limited by the lack of translations of his hermeneutic work.

==Major works==

Betti was a prolific writer. This is just a small part of his works:

*''Sulla opposizione dell'exceptio sull'actio e sulla concorrenza tra loro'' (1913).
*''La vendicatio romana primitiva e il suo svolgimento storico nel diritto privato e nel processo'' (1915).
*''L'antitesi storica tra iudicare (pronuntiatio) e damnare (condemnatio) nello svolgimento del processo romano'' (1915).
*''Studii sulla litis aestimatio del processo civile romano'': I Pavia (1915), III (Camerino, 1919).
*''Sul valore dogmatico della categoria contahere in giuristi proculiani e sabiniani'' (1916).
*''La restaurazione sullana e il suo esito (Contributo allo studio della crisi della costituzione repubblicana in Roma)'' (1916).

'''''Erbauliche Monaths Unterredungen''''' ("Edifying Monthly Discussions") was a [[German philosophy]] periodical issued from 1663 to 1668.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=magazine (publishing)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/356421/magazine#ref200910|publisher=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the publication's scope tended to be narrow (the majority of its content was singly authored by [[Johann von Rist|Johann Rist]], a theologian and poet from Hamburg), it inspired the creation of other similar magazines and led to an enthusiasm for education among its primarily intellectual audience.

The 'Erbauliche Monaths Unterredungen' is considered to be one of the earliest publications to resemble a modern [[magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=magazine (publishing)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/356421/magazine#ref200910|publisher=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">The '''faculties of the soul''' are the individual characteristics of a [[soul]].  There have been different attempts to define them over the centuries.

==Plato, Aristotle and their followers==

[[Plato]] defined the faculties of the soul in terms of a three-fold division: the intellect (''no√ªs''), the nobler affections (''thum√≥s''), and the appetites or passions (''epithumetik√≥n'')&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Faculties of the Soul}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aristotle]] also made a three-fold division of natural faculties, into vegetative, appetitive and rational elements,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 88-90&lt;/ref&gt; though he later distinguished further divisions in the rational faculty, such as the faculty of judgement and that of cleverness (deinotes).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 218-222&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic philosophers continued his three-fold division;&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Hawi, ''Islamic Naturalism and Mysticism'' (1974) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  but later Scholastic philosophers defined five groups of faculties:&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Faculties of the Soul|Faculties of the Soul]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* dun√°meis - the "vegetative" faculty (threptik√≥n), concerned with the maintenance and development of organic life
* the appetite (oretik√≥n), or the tendency to any good
* the faculty of sense perception (aisthetik√≥n)
* the "locomotive" faculty (kinetik√≥n), which presides over the various bodily movements
* reason (dianoetik√≥n)

==Calvin==
[[John Calvin]] opposed the scholastic philosophers, favoring a two-fold division of the soul, consisting of intellect and of will.&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'' (2008) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty psychology==
The secularisation of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] produced a [[faculty psychology]] of different but inherent mental powers such as intelligence or memory, distinct (as in Aristotelianism) from the acquired habits.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gregory, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (1987) p. 253-4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Habberley Price''', FBA (17 May 1899 ‚Äì 26 November 1984), usually cited as '''H. H. Price''', was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] philosopher, known for his work on the [[philosophy of perception]]. He also wrote on [[parapsychology]].

==Biography==

Born in [[Neath]], [[Glamorganshire]], [[Wales]], Price was educated at [[Winchester College]] and [[New College, Oxford]].  He obtained first-class honours in [[Literae Humaniores]] in 1921. He was a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, 1922‚Äì4, Assistant Lecturer in philosophy at the university of Liverpool (1922‚Äì23), Fellow and Tutor of Trinity College Oxford (1924‚Äì35), Lecturer in philosophy at Oxford (1932‚Äì35) and [[Wykeham Professor of Logic]] and Fellow of New College (1935‚Äì59). Price was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1943 to 1944. He was elected to the British Academy in 1943.

Price is perhaps best known for his work on the [[philosophy of perception]].  He argues for a sophisticated sense-datum account, although he rejects [[phenomenalism]].  In his book ''Thinking and Experience'', he moves from perception to thought and argues for a dispositionalist account of conceptual cognition.  Concepts are held to be a kind of intellectual capacity, manifested in perceptual contexts as recognitional capacities.  For Price, concepts are not some kind of mental entity or representation.  The ultimate appeal is to a species of memory distinct from event recollection.

He died in [[Oxford]].

==Parapsychology==

Price had written various publications on [[parapsychology]], often advocating new concepts and theories. He was President of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (1939‚Äì40, 1960‚Äì1)

===Afterlife===

Price had speculated on the nature of the [[afterlife]] and developed his own hypothesis about what the afterlife may be like. According to Price after death the self will find itself in a dream world of [[memories]] and mental images from their life. Price wrote that the hypothetical "next world would be realms of real mental images." Price however believed that the self may be able to draw upon its memories of previous physical existence to create an environment of totally new images. According to Price, the dream world will not follow the laws of [[physics]] just as ordinary [[dreams]] do not. In addition, he wrote that each person will experience a world of their own, though he also wrote that the dream world doesn't necessarily have to be [[solipsistic]] as different selves may be able to communicate with each other by [[dream telepathy]].&lt;ref&gt;Price, H.

===Place memories===

Price had invented the concept of "place memories" (see [[Stone Tape]]). He proposed that [[hauntings]] could be explained by [[memories]] becoming lost from an individual's [[mind]] and then somehow attaching itself to the environment which could be picked up by others as [[hallucinations]].&lt;ref&gt;Price, H. H. (1940). Some philosophical questions about telepathy and clairvoyance. Philosophy, 15,
363‚Äì374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pamelaheath.com/PDF/PlaceMemory2.pdf Pamela Rae Heath A New Theory on Place Memory]&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that "place memories" could explain [[psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]].&lt;ref&gt;James Houran ''From Shaman to scientist: essays on humanity's search for spirits'' 2004, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychic ether===

Linking his afterlife hypothesis with the concept of place memories Price proposed another hypothesis called the "psychic ether" hypothesis. He wrote that this hypothesis would explain where the [[memories]] would be stored for [[hauntings]] as well as for [[clairvoyance]], [[ghosts]] and other [[paranormal]] phenomena. Price proposed that a universal psychic ether coexisting [[dimension]] exists as an intermediary between the [[mind|mental]] and ordinary [[matter]]. According to Price the psychic ether consists of images and ideas. Price wrote that apparitions are actually memories from people and that under the right conditions they can be seen as hallucinations. Price believed that the dreamlike world of the afterlife exists in the psychic ether.&lt;ref&gt;Price, H. H. (1939). Haunting and the psychic ether hypothesis; with some preliminary reflections on the present condition and possible future of psychical research. Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, 45, 307‚Äì343.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Ramakrishna Rao, V. Gowri Rammohan ''New frontiers of human science: a festschrift for K.

Nash ''Parapsychology, the science of psiology'' 1986, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; According to (Ellwood, 2001) the psychic ether of Price is "a posited level of reality consisting of persisting, dynamic images created by the mind and capable of being perceived by certain persons."&lt;ref&gt;Gracia Fay Ellwood ''The uttermost deep: the challenge of near-death experiences'' 2001, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===

Some researchers have attempted to update the afterlife hypothesis of Price. Michael Grosso (1979) in an extension of Price's theory suggested that the "ego may become fragmented in the afterlife state and when ones wish's and desires are played out may experience a transpersonal state akin to those experienced by the mystics".&lt;ref&gt;Grosso, M. (1979). The survival of personality in a mind-dependent world. Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, 73, 367‚Äì380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Ramakrishna Rao, V. Gowri Rammohan ''New Frontiers of Human Science: A Festschrift for K. Ramakrishna Rao'' 2002, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The [[psychical researcher]] Ralph Noyes (1998) published an article discussing the theories of Price and attempted to update them with recent finds in parapsychology. Noyes proposed that the mental world of Price is a "[[psychosphere]]" which he defined as a "vast and complex cauldron of ideas, memories, volitions, desires and all the other furniture of conscious experience and unconscious mental functioning".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Noyes ''The concept of a psychosphere: A heuristic suggestion'' Journal of the Society for Psychical Research (1998) Volume: 62, Issue: 851, Apr 1998, pp. 353‚Äì360&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common criticism of HH Price's afterlife hypothesis has come from the religious community as his suggestions are not consistent with traditional Christian teaching, nor the teachings of any other [[monotheistic]] religion.&lt;ref&gt;Libby Ahluwalia ''Understanding philosophy of religion Edexcel'' 2008, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotes ==
"When I see a tomato there is much that I can doubt.  I can doubt whether it is a tomato that I am seeing, and not a cleverly painted piece of wax.  I can doubt whether there is any material thing there at all.  Perhaps what I took for a tomato was really a reflection; perhaps I am even the victim of some hallucination.  One thing however I cannot doubt: that there exists a red patch of a round and somewhat bulgy shape, standing out from a background of other colour-patches, and having a certain visual depth, and that this whole field of colour is directly present to my consciousness."

'''Hard determinism''' (or '''metaphysical determinism''') is a view on [[free will]] which holds that [[determinism]] is true, and that it is [[incompatibilism|incompatible with free will]], and, therefore, that free will does not exist. Although hard determinism generally refers to [[nomological determinism]],&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vihvelin |first=Kadri |editor=Edward N.

== In history == 
In [[ancient Greece]], [[Socrates]] initiated the rationalistic teaching that any agent is obliged to pursue the chief good conceived by his or her mind.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Protagoras, 345e; 358c.&lt;/ref&gt; The peripatetic naturalist [[Strato of Lampsacus]] speculated that an unconscious divine power acts in the world and causes the origin, growth and breakdown of things.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ‚Äò‚ÄôDe natura deorum‚Äô ‚Äò[On the Nature of Gods], I, 35 (XIII).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Cronus]] asserted the identity of the possible and the necessary and inferred that future events are as determined as the past ones.&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, ‚Äò ‚ÄòDiscourses‚Äô ‚Äò, B, 19, 1 in ‚Äò ‚ÄòDiscourses, Fragments, Handbook‚Äô ‚Äò, trans.

Henry Chadwick. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965. II, 20, 340.55-342.61.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, both [[John Locke|Locke]]&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John.‚Äô ‚ÄòEssay Concerning Human Understanding‚Äô ‚Äò, XXI.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spinoza]]&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza, Baruch. ‚Äò ‚ÄòEthica ordine geometrico demonstrata‚Äô ‚Äô [Ethics, Demonstrated in Geometrical Order], Pars II, Propositio XXXV, Scholium; Propositio XLVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for strict causality of volitional acts.

[[Schopenhauer]] observed that everyone regards himself free ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''; however, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]'' he must discover that he had been obliged to make the decisions he actually made.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. ‚Äò ‚ÄòDie Welt als Wille und Vorstellung‚Äô ‚Äò[The World as Will and Idea].

==Overview==
Meeting a challenge, agents make decisions in conformity to the inherited character, life history and current stimuli. The field of acute attention is limited, and motives partly remain unconscious. From the first person's perspective we have an intuitive commitment that many options are available. However, if the total of the mental content is considered from the third person's perspective, only a single decision deemed by the agent as the most favorable at the moment turns out real. The validity of causation for any mental event becomes apparent taking into account their neurophysiological correlates.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, Ted. ''Mind and Brain: A Theory of Determinism''. Volume 1, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1990, p.244. {{ISBN|978-0198242826}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Different causal descriptions correspond to the mental and physical domain.&lt;ref&gt;Searle J. "Mental causation, conscious and unconscious", ''Int J.Philosophical Studies'' (2000), Volume 8, p.171-177.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics govern the latter. Admitting downright mental causation of physiological impulses would mean surplus determination. The surmise that under identical conditions, alternative decisions and actions are possible is disproved by naturalists as an illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Walter H. "Neurophilosophy of free will" in  ''Oxford Handbook of Free Will'', Oxford: Oxford University Press [2002], p.565-575.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hard determinism is not taken to refer merely to a determinism on earth, but in all of reality (e.g. involving the effects of light from other galaxies, etc.); not just during a certain deterministic period of time, but for all time. This also means that the relation of necessity will be bi-directional. Just as the initial conditions of the universe presumably determine all future states, so too does the present necessitate the past. In other words, one could not change any one fact without affecting the entire timeline. Because hard determinists often support this [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalist]] view of time, they do not believe that there are genuine chances or possibilities, only the idea that events are 100% likely.&lt;ref name=SEPDeterminism&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,"Causal Determinism"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike "law fundamentalists", some philosophers are "law pluralists": they question what it means to have a law of physics. One example is the "Best Standards Analysis", which says that the laws are only useful ways to summarize all past events, rather than there being metaphysically "pushy" entities (this route still brings one into conflict with the idea of free will).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Some law pluralists further believe there are simply no laws of physics.&lt;ref name=SEPDeterminism/&gt; The [[mathematical universe hypothesis]] suggests that there are other universes in which the laws of physics and [[fundamental constants]] are different. Andreas Albrecht of [[Imperial College]] in London called it a "provocative" solution to one of the central problems facing physics. Although he "wouldn't dare" go so far as to say he believes it, he noted that "it's actually quite difficult to construct a theory where everything we see is all there is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chown |first=Markus |date=June 1998 |title=Anything goes |journal=New Scientist |volume=158 |number=2157 |url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe_press.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feasibility of testing determinism is always challenged by what we know, or think we can know, about the idea of a final, all encompassing, [[theory of everything]]. Some physicists challenge the likelihood of determinism on the grounds that certain [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] stipulate that the universe is fundamentally [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], such as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]]; whereas other interpretations are deterministic, for example, the [[De Broglie-Bohm Theory]] and the [[many-worlds interpretation]].
[[Chaos theory]] describes how a deterministic system can exhibit perplexing behavior that is difficult to predict: as in the [[butterfly effect]], minor variations between the starting conditions of two systems can result in major differences. Yet chaos theory is a wholly deterministic thesis; it merely demonstrates the potential for vastly different consequences from very similar initial conditions. Properly understood, then, it enlightens and reinforces the deterministic claim.&lt;ref name=SEPDeterminism/&gt;

== Implications for ethics ==
{{see also|Moral responsibility}}
[[File:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Some hard determinists would hold [[Artificial intelligence|robotic beings]] of sufficient intelligence morally responsible (pictured above: attempts to build lifelike machines).]]
Hard determinists reject free will. Critics often suggest that, in so doing, the hard determinist also rejects [[ethics]]. The key to this argument rests on the idea that holding a person morally responsible requires for them to make a choice between two, or more, truly possible alternatives. If choice is indeed impossible, then it would be incorrect to hold anyone morally responsible for his or her actions. If this argument holds, hard determinists are restricted to [[moral nihilism]].
This feature, however, is tenable only as far as hard determinists discard responsibility. In a necessitarian world, recourse to merit and blameworthiness is toned down but adherence to ethical and legal values is not ruined. Persons may be appreciated as carriers, executers and defenders of morality. Alternative choice being absent, regret for past misdeeds becomes unreasonable. Nevertheless, one can admonish oneself for one's lapses and resolve to avoid similar behavior in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Pereboom, Derk, ' 'Meaning in life without free will ‚Äò‚Äò, in ''Oxford Handbook of Free Will'', Oxford:Oxford University Press [2002], p.477-488.&lt;/ref&gt;
Those hard determinists who defend [[ethical realism]] would object to the premise that contra-causal free will is necessary for ethics. Those who are also [[ethical naturalism|ethically naturalistic]] may also point out that there are good reasons to [[punish]] criminals: it is a chance to [[behaviour modification|modify their behaviour]], or their punishment can act as a deterrent for others who would otherwise act in the same manner. The hard determinist could even argue that this understanding of the [[Truth|true]] and [[fallacy of the single cause|various causes]] of a psychopath's behaviour, for instance, allow them to respond even more reasonably or compassionately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/life-without-free-will Sam Harris, "Life Without Free Will"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hard determinists acknowledge that humans do, in some sense, "choose", or deliberate ‚Äì although in a way that obeys natural laws. For example, a hard determinist might see humans as a sort of [[artificial intelligence|thinking machines]], but believe it is inaccurate to say they "came to a decision" or "chose".
Generalization of event causation should circumvent overstatement of external impulses. [[Autotelic]] personalities show a high rate of activities all by themselves. The capacity to resist psychological assault is an impressive evidence of autarkic resources. Determinists even admit that with corresponding knowledge, changes in the genetic depository and consequently behavior are possible.

Up to now, the concepts and terminology of legal affairs follow the pre-reflexive belief in alternative possibilities. As scientific insight advances, the juridical attitude becomes increasingly "external": there should be fewer emotions about offender's will and more concern about the effects of offenses on society. The retributive function of punishment should be rejected as irrational and unjustified. "Lex talionis" is discarded already because of deficient correlation between crime and penalty. If the inveterate notion of "mens rea" is used at all, then only to distinguish intentional actions from inadvertent ones and not to designate an autonomous undertaking of the lawbreaker. At the same time, it is justified to require the perpetrator to critically reconsider his intentions and character, to demand apology and compensation in victims' favor. The rehabilitation service should be used to train the risky circle for keeping the norms of social life.&lt;ref&gt;Caruso Gregg D. ‚Äò ‚ÄòFree will skepticism and criminal behavior: A public health-quarantine model‚Äô ‚Äò.‚Äô ‚ÄòSouthwest Philosophy Review‚Äô ‚Äò(2016), Volume 32, no.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological effects of belief in hard determinism ==
Some behavioral anomalies have been observed in persons cultivating the habit of causal awareness. Increased aggressiveness, excessive compliance and reduced helpfulness are reported. Critical assessment of one's own former conduct appeared abated.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister R.F., Masicampo C.J., De Wall C.N.‚Äô ‚ÄòProsocial benefits of feeling free: disbelief in will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness‚Äô, ‚ÄòPersonality and Social Psychology Bulletin‚Äô (2009), Volume 35, no.2, p.260-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William James]] was an [[United States|American]] [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher who coined the terms "soft determinist" and "hard determinist" in an influential essay titled "The Dilemma of Determinism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://csunx2.bsc.edu/bmyers/WJ1.htmWilliam James - ''The Dilemma of Determinism'']&lt;/ref&gt; He argued against determinism, holding that the important issue is not personal responsibility, but hope. He believed that thorough-going determinism leads either to a bleak [[pessimism]] or to a degenerate [[subjectivism]] in moral judgment. He proposed the way to escape the dilemma is to allow a role for [[Randomness|chance]]. James was careful to explain that he would rather "debate about objects than words", however. He did not insist in saying that replacing determinism with a model including chance had to mean we had "free will".

The determinist would counter-argue that there is still reason for hope. Whether or not the universe is determined does not change the fact that the future is unknown, and might very well always be. From a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] point of view, a person's actions still play a role in the shape of that future. Thomas W. Clark, founder and director of the Center for Naturalism, explains that humans are not merely the playthings of patterned, natural forces in the universe - but rather we are ourselves examples of those forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalism.org/freewill1.htm Naturalism.org, "Free Will and Naturalism: A Reply to Corliss Lamont"]&lt;/ref&gt;
The deterministic view aligns our representations with the faculties and possibilities we actually possess but it should avoid misleading introspection. Admitting agents‚Äô dependence on a drastic background can enhance insight, moderate severity and spare unproductive suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Mazlovskis Arnis.‚Äô ‚ÄôOn free will and determinism‚Äô ‚Äò.‚Äô ‚ÄòReliƒüiski-filozofiski raksti‚Äô ‚Äò[Religious-Philosophical Articles] (2015), XIX, p.22-42.

[[File:Gl√∂ckner-Faltung-DD.jpg|thumb|‚ÄûMast mit zwei Faltungszonen‚Äú ‚Äì plastic by Hermann Gl√∂ckner, [[Technische Universit√§t Dresden]]]]

'''Hermann Gl√∂ckner''' (21 January 1889 ‚Äì 25 May 1987) was a German painter and sculptor. He was an important representative of [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]].

Gl√∂ckner was born in Cotta near [[Dresden]]. He attended the vocational school in [[Leipzig]] in 1903 and worked as a designer for textiles. From 1904 to 1911 he attended the evening classes at the [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] in Dresden, where he became friends with [[Friedrich Kurt Fiedler|Kurt Fiedler]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Gl√∂ckner ‚Äì Ein Patriarch der Moderne. Ed. by [[John Erpenbeck]]. Der Morgen. Berlin 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Among their lectures were [[Oskar Seyffert]] and [[Carl Rade]], who later was a renowned professor at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]] and remained a friend of Gl√∂ckner for many years. Gl√∂ckner was mainly interested in [[drawings]], but also in projections and geometry. From 1914 to 1918 he served in [[infantry]] divisions in France, Russia, and Poland.

After [[World War I]] Gl√∂ckner earned some money with the copying of paintings for the [[Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister]]. At the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts he studied with [[Otto Gussmann]] from 1923 to 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Die gro√üen Dresdner. 26 Ann√§herungen. Ed. by Karin Nitzschke. Insel Verlag. Frankfurt am Main und Leipzig 1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Grundig]] was among his fellow students. His experimental style, however, did not find everyone's appreciation and Gl√∂ckner left the academy again.&lt;ref&gt;G√ºnter Meissner: Allgemeines K√ºnstlerlexikon: die bildenden K√ºnstler aller Zeiten und V√∂lker. K.G. Saur Verlag 1992. pp 198‚Äì201&lt;/ref&gt; As a freelancer he turned to constructivism ever deeper during the following years. In 1932 he became a member of the re-founded ''Dresdner Sezession''. The [[Nazi]]s refused him any opportunities to exhibit and sell his paintings and graphics. So he turned to [[sgraffito]] to earn his living.

Gl√∂ckner lost his home during [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II]] and moved to [[Loschwitz]]. Because of his [[Formalism (art)|formalist style]], the officials of the [[East Germany|GDR]] refused him the appreciation he deserved for a long time. His rehabilitation began with an exhibition of his graphical work in the ''[[Kupferstich-Kabinett (Dresden)|Kupferstichkabinett]]'', Dresden in 1969. In 1979 he received a permanent visa for the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. Finally, in 1984, he was awarded with the [[National Prize of the GDR]] and the [[DEFA]] dedicated a film to him. Centrally in the area of the [[Technische Universit√§t Dresden]] he was allowed to erect a sculpture, which had been banned just a few years before. Another sculpture was erected one year later in the park of the Hotel Bellevue, Dresden's first address that time.

In his later years Gl√∂ckner regularly visited [[West Berlin]], where his cohabitee lived and where he died in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifa.de/en/visual-arts/exhibitions-abroad/on-special-conditions/hermann-gloeckner.html Exhibition at the ''Institut f√ºr Auslandsbeziehungen'' (ifa)]&lt;/ref&gt; Gl√∂ckner's urn was entombed in Loschwitz. A street in Loschwitz, newly built in 2008, is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dresden.stadtwiki.de/wiki/Hermann_Gl%C3%B6ckner Hermann Gl√∂ckner in Dresden]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Gl√∂ckner made his works from objects he had on hand: twine, cardboard, match boxes, and wood scrapes. These common objects were put together in a unique way to create something entirely new. This art was private with the only audience being his wife.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austere.co/a-history-of-hermann-glockner&lt;/ref&gt;

R. Norton's Amal and the Shi'a: Struggle for the Soul of Lebanon University of Texas Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

According to "The Hizballah Program" the principles of its ideology are:&lt;ref name="The Hizballah Program"&gt;[http://www.standwithus.com/pdfs/flyers/hezbollah_program.pdf An open letter, The Hizballah program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029000205/http://www.standwithus.com/pdfs/flyers/hezbollah_program.pdf |date=29 October 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* To expel Americans, the French and their allies definitely from Lebanon, putting an end to any colonialist entity on our land.
* To submit the phalanges to a just power and bring them all to justice for the crimes they have perpetrated against Muslims and Christians.
* To permit all the sons of our people to determine their future and to choose in all the liberty the form of government their desire. We call upon all of them to pick the option of Islamic government which, alone, is capable of guaranteeing justice and liberty for all. Only an Islamic regime can stop any future tentative attempts of imperialistic infiltration onto our country.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:ÿÆŸÖ€åŸÜ€å ÿØÿ± ŸÖÿµÿßÿ≠ÿ®Ÿá.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979]]
It listed the Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] as the leader whose "orders we obey"; called on Christians to "open your hearts to our call" and "embrace Islam" and noted that "Allah has ... made it intolerable for Muslims to participate in ... a regime which is not predicated upon ... the [[Sharia]]"; explained that [[Israel]] is "the vanguard of the United States in our Islamic world".&lt;ref name="The Hizballah Program"/&gt;

More broadly, current leader Sheikh Nasserallah has described Hizb'Allah's ideology as having "two main axis: firstly, a belief in the rule by the just [[jurisconsult]] and adherence to Khomeini's leadership; and secondly, the continued need to struggle against the Israeli enemy".&lt;ref&gt;''Ettela'at'', 13 February 1993. In Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon'', (1997), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Hezbollah underwent what a number of observers have called a process of "Lebanonization", which is reflected in acceptance of a multi-confessional Lebanon, [[rapprochement]] with a variety of non-Islamist forces, participation in [[elections|electoral politics]], and an emphasis on providing for the [[social welfare]] of its Shi'a Lebanese constituency.&lt;ref name="Usher"&gt;[[Graham Usher]], "Hizballah, Syria, and the Lebanese Elections", ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', Vol. 26, No. 2. (Winter, 1997), pp. 59‚Äì67.&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency was expressed in religious as well as strategic terms:

{{quote|Christians and Jews differ with Muslims concerning the interpretation of the unity of God and the personality of God. Despite that, the Qur'an commands: Turn to the principle of unity‚Äîthe unity of God and the unity of mankind. We interpret this to mean that we can meet with Marxists on the common ground of standing up to the forces of international arrogance; we can meet nationalists, even secular nationalists, on the common ground of Arab causes, which are also Islamic causes. Islam recognizes the Other.... So Islam does not negate the Other; it invites the Other to dialogue.&lt;ref name="Fadlallah"&gt;Mahmoud Soueid, "Islamic Unity and Political Change. Interview with Shaykh Muhammad Hussayn Fadlallah", ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', Vol. 25, No. 1. (Autumn, 1995), pp. 61‚Äì75.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since then, Hizbullah published a new manifesto on 1 December 2009, which shifts its direction to better stay coherent with the current situation in their community. This new manifesto contains language that downplays the Islamic rhetoric and focuses more on integration into their community. Furthermore, the new manifesto calls for the elimination of the sectarian system in place right now in Lebanon and calls for replacement of this system by a secular modern system. However, the new manifesto states that the US and Israel are still Hizb'Allah's prime enemies. Moreover, it eliminates the possibility of open discussion on its right to bear arms.  It pursues this agenda with the assistance of various like-minded [[Major Islamic Political Alliances|Allies]] in the region.

==Shi'a Islamism==
{{Islamism sidebar}}
Hezbollah's original 1985 manifesto reads:

{{quote|We are the sons of the ummah (Muslim community) ‚Äì the party of God (Hizb Allah) the vanguard of which was made victorious by God in Iran. There the vanguard succeeded to lay down the bases of a Muslim state which plays a central role in the world. We obey the orders of one leader, wise and just, that of our tutor and faqih (jurist) who fulfills all the necessary conditions: Ruhollah Musawi Khomeini.... We are an umma linked to the Muslims of the whole world by the solid doctrinal and religious connection of Islam, whose message God wanted to be fulfilled by the Seal of the Prophets, i.e., Muhammad. Our behavior is dictated to us by legal principles laid down by the light of an overall political conception defined by the leading jurist.... As for our culture, it is based on the Holy Koran, the Sunna and the legal rulings of the faqih who is our source of imitation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web

Hezbollah was largely formed with the aid of the [[Ayatollah]] [[Khomeini]]'s followers in the early eighties in order to spread [[Islamic revolution]]&lt;ref name= autogenerated2 /&gt; and follows a distinct version of Islamic [[Shi'a]] ideology ("[[Guardianship of the Islamic jurists|Willayat Al-Faqih]]") developed by [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], leader of the Islamic Revolution in [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Shatz, ''New York Review of Books'', 29 April 2004 [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/17060 In Search of Hezbollah] Accessed 15 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hezbollah believes in one-person-one-vote system and disagree with the [[Confessionalism (politics)|multi-confessional]] quotas under the [[Taif Agreement|Ta'if Accord]], it does not intend to force a one-person-one-vote system onto the country's Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Cobban (April/May 2005). ''[http://bostonreview.net/BR30.2/cobban.html Hizbullah's New Face]. ''[[Boston Review]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hezbollah views its conflict with Israel and the Jewish people as religiously motivated. The [[history of the Arab-Israeli conflict]] to them is a repeat of the negative interactions between the Jews of medieval Arabia and Muhammad and the early ''umma'' described in the [[Koran]] and other classical Islamic texts. God, according to Hezbollah theology, cursed all Jews as blasphemers damned for all time and throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Hezbollah literature professes, "Certainly you will find the most violent people in enmity for those who believe are the Jews and those who are polytheists." qtd. Jaber, [https://books.google.com/books?id=m_ktBrZfuUYC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=theological+hezbollah+jewish&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6BzXdh4dbV&amp;sig=5TZKuOX3gWm4TW15zit1a_KME-8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DJ03Tf-YC4HGsAOEl_C2Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=theological%20hezbollah%20jewish&amp;f=false "Hezbollah: born with a vengeance".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Al-'Ahd, 6 December 1991; quoted in Webman, ''Anti-Semitic Motifs'', p. 10. qtd. in Wistrich, ''A Lethal Obsession'', p. 766.&lt;/ref&gt; Hezbollah (as well as the political/religious leaders of Iran) believe that the destruction of Israel will bring about the "reappearance of the [[Imam]] (the Shiite Islamic Messiah)".&lt;ref name="Wistrich770"&gt;[[Robert S. Wistrich|Wistrich, Robert S.]] ''A Lethal Obsession: Anti-Semitism from Antiquity to the Global Jihad''. New York: Random House, 2010. p. 770.&lt;/ref&gt; These issues exist independently of Israeli treatment of Palestinians or even the existence of the State of Israel, although Hezbollah has strong objections to these more earthly matters as well. Hezbollah leader [[Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah]] has said in an interview that "Israel is an illegitimate entity and it is a threat to the region. It is a constant threat to the whole region. We cannot coexist with this threat. That is why the ultimate goal of the [Arab and Islamic] nation is to end Israel's existence irrespective of the problems, sensitivities and everything that has happened and could happen between Palestinians and non-Palestinians, Shia and Sunni, Muslims and Christians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nasrallah: Israel is a cancer and the ultimate goal should be to remove it |url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Nasrallah-Israel-is-a-cancer-and-the-ultimate-goal-should-be-to-remove-it-371182 |publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's occupation of the [[Shebaa Farms]], along with the presence of [[Lebanese prisoners in Israel|Lebanese prisoners in Israeli jails]], is often used as a pretext and stated as justification for the Hezbollah's continued hostilities against Israel even after Israel's verified withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000. Hezbollah's spokesperson Hassan Ezzedin, however, said that

During the years prior to its official founding, Hezbollah was held responsible or partially responsible for several attacks on Western (mostly American) targets and it has been blamed for killing many Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Laura.

We combat abomination and we shall tear out its very roots, its primary roots, which are the US."&lt;ref name="The Hizballah Program"/&gt; Hezbollah supporters chant "[[Death to America]]" in demonstrations every year.&lt;ref&gt;"Hizbullah Leader [[Hasan Nasrallah]]: 'The American Administration Is Our Enemy ...

Hezbollah leader Fadlallah has told an interviewer,

&lt;blockquote&gt;We believe there is no difference between the United States and Israel; the latter is a mere extension of the former. The United States is ready to fight the whole world to defend Israel's existence and security. The two countries are working in complete harmony, and the United States is certainly not inclined to exert pressure on Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Interview in July 1985, quoted in Martin Kramer, "The Oracle of Hizbullah: Sayiid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah", Part II, in ''Spokesmen for the Despised: Fundamentalist Leaders of the Middle East'', ed.

===Jews and Judaism===
Hezbollah has declared that it distinguishes between [[Zionism]] and Judaism and that it opposes Zionism.

*On 30 November 2009, while reading the party's new political manifesto, Hassan Nasrallah declared "Our problem with [the Israelis] is not that they are Jews, but that they are occupiers who are raping our land and holy places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ladki |first=Nadim |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE5AT3VK20091130?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=11621&amp;sp=true |title=Hezbollah cuts Islamist rhetoric in new manifesto |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a Pro-Palestinian Convention held in [[Beirut]] in 2005, Hezbollah representative in the Lebanese Parliament Abdallah Qussayr&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Farid Emile Chedid, ecrr@inco.com.lb |url=http://www.lebanonwire.com/parliament/members_2000.asp |title=Lebanonwire.com/Lebanese Parliament Members |publisher=Lebanonwire.com |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that "Hezbollah has never been against religions. Hezbollah supports all religions, it supports interfaith dialogue, and it has no problem with any religion. Hezbollah considers Zionism to be the enemy, not the Jews as a people or a religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/570.htm |title=Anti-Zionist Rabbis Join Hizbullah and Hamas At Beirut Pro-Palestinian Convention |publisher=Memritv.org |date=23 February 2005 |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Alagha concluded that Hezbollah "neither discriminates against the Jews as a religion nor as a race" and that it is "not anti-Semitic in its overall orientation."&lt;ref name="Alagha" /&gt;

*Commenting on a recent project for rebuilding the [[Maghen Abraham Synagogue]] in Beirut, Hussein Rahhal, a spokesman for Hezbollah said that the group supported the restoration of the synagogue: "We respect the Jewish religion just like we do Christianity.... The Jews have always lived among us. We have an issue with Israel's occupation of land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Derhally |first=Massoud A. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=aNOWKEnqxKdU&amp;refer=europe |title=Lebanon Jews Tap Diaspora to Rebuild Beirut's Shelled Synagogue |publisher=Bloomberg |date=17 September 2008 |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the group has been accused of using [[antisemitism]].

*[[Robert S. Wistrich]] devotes an entire chapter of his comprehensive, worldwide history of anti-Semitism, ''A Lethal Obsession'', to Hezbollah and other like-minded anti-Semitic groups. In the book, Wistrich described Hezbollah's anti-Semitism as

&lt;blockquote&gt;contempt normally reserved for weak and cowardly enemies. Like the [[Hamas]] propaganda for holy war, that of Hezbollah has relied on the endless vilification of Jews as 'enemies of mankind,' 'conspiratorial, obstinate, and conceited' adversaries full of 'satanic plans' to enslave the Arabs. It fuses traditional [[Islam and antisemitism|Islamic anti-Judaism]] with [[Jewish conspiracy|Western conspiracy myths]], Third Worldist anti-Zionism, and Iranian Shiite contempt for Jews as 'ritually impure' and corrupt infidels.&lt;ref&gt;Wistrich, 766‚Äì767&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Jeffrey Goldberg]], staff writer for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', described the group as a "very, very radical, anti-Semitic organization."&lt;ref&gt;Block, Melissa.

''[[United Jewish Communities]]''. 14 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An article by [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 2002 quoted [[Ibrahim Mousawi]], the director of English-language news at [[Al Manar]], calling the Jews "a lesion on the forehead of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

*According to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], Hassan Nasrallah, speaking at the Shi'ite Moslem "Ashura" flagellation ceremony on 9 April 2000, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Jews invented the legend of the Nazi atrocities.... Anyone who reads the Koran and the holy writings of the monotheistic religions sees what they did to the prophets, and what acts of madness and slaughter the Jews carried out throughout history.... Anyone who reads these texts cannot think of co-existence with them, of peace with them, or about accepting their presence, not only in Palestine of 1948 but even in a small village in Palestine, because they are a cancer which is liable to spread again at any moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2000/4/Excerpts%20from%20Speech%20by%20Hizbullah%20Secretary-Genera] "Excerpts from Speech by Hizbullah Secretary-General Nasrallah ‚Äì 9 April 2000" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023021211/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2000/4/Excerpts%20from%20Speech%20by%20Hizbullah%20Secretary-Genera |date=23 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*According to Shaul Shai, Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech delivered in Beirut and aired on Al-Manar TV on 28 September 2001: "What do the Jews want? They want security and money.

==Position on use of armed strength to achieve aims==
Hezbollah's 1985 founding Manifesto reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;whatever touches or strikes the Muslims in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Philippines and elsewhere reverberates throughout the whole Muslim umma of which we are an integral part.... No one can imagine the importance of our military potential as our military apparatus is not separate from our overall social fabric. Each of us is a fighting soldier. And when it becomes necessary to carry out the Holy War, each of us takes up his assignment in the fight in accordance with the injunctions of the Law, and that in the framework of the mission carried out under the tutelage of the Commanding Jurist."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hezbollah regards any act of violence committed against any Israeli as "legitimate resistance."&lt;ref name="Wistrich774" /&gt;

==Women's rights==

In keeping with Lebanon's generally secular and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[culture of Lebanon|culture]], Hezbollah recognizes and promotes [[women's rights]] somewhat more strongly than do [[Women in Muslim societies|other groups]] associated with Islamic [[jihad]], as per Hezbollah's self-proclaimed "model and example."&lt;ref name="memri_blaarghwtf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&amp;Area=iran&amp;ID=SP123206|publisher=The Middle East Media Research Institute|title=Iranian and Syrian Reactions to the Latest Developments in the Middle East Crisis|date=4 August 2006|accessdate=8 August 2006}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

One member of the Hezbollah Political Council, speaking to an ''Online Journal'' correspondent in July 2006, claimed that "Hezbollah differs from many Islamic groups in our treatment of women. We believe women have the ability like men to participate in all parts of life."&lt;ref name="oj_article_fsm4d" /&gt; The ''Online Journal'' correspondent writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;From its founding in the 1980s, Hezbollah women have headed education, medical and social service organizations. Most recently Hezbollah nominated several women to run in the Lebanese elections. It named Wafa Hoteit as a chief of Al Noor Radio ... and promoted 37-year-old Rima Fakhry to its highest ruling body, the Hezbollah Political Council. Part of Fakhry's duties include interpreting Islamic feminism in Sharia law for the Committee for Political Analysis."&lt;ref name="oj_article_fsm4d" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Sectarianism==
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has many times spoken against sectarianism&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2010/Feb-06/55749-nasrallah-slams-attempts-to-stoke-sectarian-strife.ashx&lt;/ref&gt; and said that he will be the first "to join a true Sunni government."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiQKm2CCtK8&lt;/ref&gt; Hezbollah has slammed ISIS for seeking to ignite sectarian strife in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Hezbollah-slams-Islamic-State-for-seeking-to-ignite-sectarian-strife-in-Lebanon-374864&lt;/ref&gt; Sectarianism, power-hungry politicians and a sham democracy are among the main factors that have prevented the establishment of a strong Lebanese state, Hezbollah MP Hasan Fadlallah has said.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/Nov-17/277962-sectarianism-prevents-model-state-hezbollah-mp.ashx#sthash.tvLMvkKU.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt; While Hezbollah strongly opposes sectarianism, its involvement in support of [[Bashar al-Assad]] against a mostly [[Sunni Muslim]] opposition in the [[Syrian Civil War]] has contributed to sectarian tensions with Lebanese Sunnis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.channel4.com/miller-on-foreign-affairs/meeting-hezbollah-fighting-dying-confused/687 Inside Hezbollah: fighting and dying for a confused cause]. ''Channel 4''. 2014-04-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Hezbollah officials have stated their aim is to defend Lebanon and Syria from ''[[takfiri]]s'', a term they use to denote Sunni Islamist forces, but which many Sunnis interpret as a slur against them as a whole, Islamist or non-Islamist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Iraq%20Syria%20Lebanon/Lebanon/153-lebanon-s-hizbollah-turns-eastward-to-syria.pdf Lebanon‚Äôs Hizbollah Turns Eastward to Syria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021094218/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Iraq%20Syria%20Lebanon/Lebanon/153-lebanon-s-hizbollah-turns-eastward-to-syria.pdf |date=21 October 2014 }}.

'''Joseph Agassi''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|√¶|g|…ô|s|i}}; {{lang-he|◊ô◊ï◊°◊£ ◊ê◊í◊°◊ô}}; born in [[Jerusalem]] on May 7, 1927) is an Israeli academic with contributions in [[logic]], scientific method, and [[philosophy]]. He studied under [[Karl Popper]] and taught at the [[London School of Economics]].  He later taught at the [[University of Hong Kong]], the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], [[Boston University]], and [[York University]] in Canada.  He had dual appointments in the last positions with [[Tel Aviv University]].

He has been married to [[Judith Buber Agassi]] &amp;ndash; [[Martin Buber]]'s granddaughter &amp;ndash; since 1949.  Together they had two children, Aaron, and Tirzah, who died of cancer in March 2008.  They currently live in [[Herzliya]], [[Israel]]. Tirzah¬¥s name, when she was a child, was often used by Popper in his dictum "Write it for Tirzah!" to explain his view that everyone has the duty to write in a clearly and easily understandable language.

== Philosophy ==

Agassi‚Äôs prime interest is in science, metaphysics, and politics. He takes it that philosophy is nothing if not rationalist.  For over fifty years he studied the rationality of science, metaphysics, and democratic politics.

An advocate of Popper‚Äôs philosophy with variations, Agassi ignores many of the problems that concern some philosophers of science, chiefly that of theory choice.  The problems of the philosophy of technology engage him, including the problem of choosing scientific theories and ideas worthy of application and implementation.

== Political philosophy ==

Agassi suggests, in line with Popper‚Äôs political philosophy, that all schools of thought have thus far neglected the one major practical problem of ethics, namely moral brakes: when should one apply them?  We know this much: the more decent people are, the sooner they are ready to put their brakes on.  For example, Agassi observes that the German nation lost its moral brakes as soon as its Nazi rulers showed their hand.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

According to Agassi, democracy is so outstanding that, no matter what the agenda is, it is still best.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He developed further the methodology of critical rationalism which he adopted from Popper. According to him, critical rationalism gives the possibility to rationalists to account for checks and balances and democracy within their rationalism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  ''Bootstrapping'' is the expression he coined for the approach to problems with the methodology of critical rationalism: Solutions are offered and then improved upon according to the results obtained as a never ending process.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He acknowledges that even democracy is not immune to errors, and that it may even lead to its own destruction as it happened in 1933 in Germany. Nevertheless, says Agassi, democracy has a fair chance for success; in particular, in [[global politics]] due to its quick recovery procedure for confronting mistakes that find their way into the agenda of democratic institutions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== Israeli politics ==
Agassi has expressed criticism against the settler movement and has advocated for Israel to "separate" from the world-wide Jewish community:

: "The flimsy excuse ‚Äì the notion that Israel belongs to the Jewish people and not to the Israeli nation ‚Äì is the very threat to its independence. It is therefore imperative that Israel should recognize its nation as separate and different from the Jewish people." &lt;ref name = "agassi1999"&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Agassi|title=Liberal Nationalism for Israel: Towards an Israeli National Identity|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oG0pauFGsMcC&amp;pg=PA105|isbn= 978-1296041007|publisher=Grefen Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global politics ==

Agassi has written widely on global politics and on the methodology to implement global politics. His methodology is consistently procedural, without having requests for systematic procedures. His demands from those that design global politics are minimalist: small methodological changes may lead to large scale achievements. 
Agassi also proposes to bring global problems to public agendas for discussions in different forums, in particular in workshops where discussions are held with an agreed upon agenda: the agenda, says Agassi should be discussed and set by the participants prior to the discussion.

== Works ==
Oguejiofor has  written and co-written numerous books and journal articles. In 2001, he authored a book, ''The Philosophical Significance of Immortality in Thomas Aquinas''. It was reviewed in ''[[The Review of Metaphysics]]'' by Leo J. Elders, who wrote, "Much research went into this clear and well-written book and the author shows a good acquaintance with the relevant literature."&lt;ref name=Elders&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elders|first1=Leo J.|title=Oguejiofor, J.

Oguejiofor has written on the subject of democracy and governance. In one essay, "Democracy and Social Movements: In Search of the Democratic Ideal", he specified three characteristics necessary for democracy to remain feasible in a given society. He wrote that the society must have a system to change the government, that people must be able to vote and to pursue political goals in such a system, and that citizens must feel connected with that system.&lt;ref name=Agulanna&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agulanna|first1=Christopher|title=Democracy and the crisis of leadership in Africa|journal=[[Journal of Social, Political, and Economic Studies]]|date=Fall 2006|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-1229809921/democracy-and-the-crisis-of-leadership-in-africa|accessdate=March 13, 2015}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julian Savulescu''' (born 22 December 1963) is an Australian philosopher and bioethicist. He is Uehiro Professor of Practical Ethics at the [[University of Oxford]], Fellow of [[St Cross College, Oxford]], Director of the [[Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics]], Sir Louis Matheson Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Monash University]], and Head of the Melbourne‚ÄìOxford Stem Cell Collaboration, which is devoted to examining the ethical implications of [[cloning]] and [[embryonic stem cell research]]. He is a former editor and current boarder member of the ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]'' (2001-2004 and 2011-2018), which is ranked as the [https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=top_venues&amp;hl=en&amp;vq=med_bioethics No.1 journal in bioethics] worldwide by Google Scholar Metrics as of 2013. In addition to his background in applied ethics and philosophy, he also has a background in medicine and completed his [[MBBS]] (Hons) at Monash University.

He completed his PhD at Monash University, under the supervision of bioethicist [[Peter Singer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/uehiro/Savulescu.mp3 Savulescu]. philosophy.ox.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procreative beneficence ==
Julian Savulescu coined the phrase ''procreative beneficence''.  It is the controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Melo-Martin I |title=On our obligation to select the best children: a reply to Savulescu |journal=Bioethics |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=72‚Äì83 |year=2004 |pmid=15168699|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2004.00379.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; putative [[moral obligation]] of [[parent]]s in a position to select their children, for instance through [[Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis|preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD), to favor those expected to have the best life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Savulescu J |authorlink=Julian Savulescu |title=Procreative beneficence: why we should select the best children |journal=Bioethics |volume=15 |issue=5‚Äì6 |pages=413‚Äì26 |date=October 2001 |pmid=12058767 |doi=10.1111/1467-8519.00251}}&lt;/ref&gt; An argument in favor of this principle is that traits (such as empathy, memory, etc.) are "all-purpose means" in the sense of being instrumental in realizing whatever life plans the child may come to have.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hens | first1 = K. | last2 = Dondorp | first2 = W. | last3 = Handyside | first3 = A. H. | last4 = Harper | first4 = J. | last5 = Newson | first5 = A. J. | last6 = Pennings | first6 = G. | last7 = Rehmann-Sutter | first7 = C. | last8 = De Wert | first8 = G. | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmt009 | title = Dynamics and ethics of comprehensive preimplantation genetic testing: A review of the challenges | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 366‚Äì75 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23466750| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some of his publications he has argued for the following: (1) that parents have a responsibility to select the best children they could have, given all of the relevant genetic information available to them, a principle that he extends to the use of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic diagnoses (PGD) in order to determine the intelligence of embryos and possible children;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1467-8519.00251|pmid=12058767|title=Procreative Beneficence: Why We Should Select the Best Children|journal=Bioethics|volume=15|issue=5‚Äì6|pages=413‚Äì26|year=2001|last1=Savulescu|first1=Julian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (2) that stem cell research is justifiable even if one accepts the view of the embryo as a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12472112|year=2002|author1=Savulescu|first1=J|title=The embryonic stem cell lottery and the cannibalization of human beings|journal=Bioethics|volume=16|issue=6|pages=508‚Äì29|doi=10.1111/1467-8519.00308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian Savulescu also justifies the destruction of embryos and fetuses as a source of organs and tissue for transplantation to adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=479188|pmid=10226910|year=1999|author1=Savulescu|first1=J|title=Should we clone human beings? Cloning as a source of tissue for transplantation|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|volume=25|issue=2|pages=87‚Äì95|doi=10.1136/jme.25.2.87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his abstract he argues, 
"The most publicly justifiable application of human cloning, if there is one at all, is to provide self-compatible cells or tissues for medical use, especially transplantation. Some have argued that this raises no new ethical issues above those raised by any form of embryo experimentation. I argue that this research is less morally problematic than other embryo research. Indeed, it is not merely morally permissible but morally required that we employ cloning to produce embryos or fetuses for the sake of providing cells, tissues or even organs for therapy, followed by abortion of the embryo or fetus."  He argues that if it is permissible to destroy fetuses, for social reasons, or no reasons at all, it must be justifiable to destroy them to save lives.

Further, as editor of the ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', he published, in 2012, an article by two Italian academics which stated that a new-born baby is effectively no different from a foetus, is not a "person" and, morally, could be killed at the decision of the parents etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9113394/Killing-babies-no-different-from-abortion-experts-say.html|title=Killing babies no different from abortion, experts say|last=Adams|first=Stephen|date=2012-02-29|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with neuro-ethicist [[Guy Kahane]], Savulescu's article "Brain Damage and the Moral Significance of Consciousness" appears to be the first mainstream publication to argue that increased evidence of consciousness in patients diagnosed with being in [[persistent vegetative state]] actually ''supports'' withdrawing or withholding care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1093/jmp/jhn038|pmid= 19193694|title= Brain Damage and the Moral Significance of Consciousness|journal= Journal of Medicine and Philosophy|volume= 34|issue= 1|pages= 6‚Äì26|year= 2009|last1= Savulescu|first1= J.|last2= Kahane|first2= G.|pmc= 3242047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Professor Savulescu presented a paper at the ‚ÄôFestival of Dangerous Ideas,‚Äô held at the Sydney Opera House in October 2009, entitled "Unfit for Life: Genetically Enhance Humanity or Face Extinction," which can be seen on [[Vimeo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/7515623 Genetically enhance humanity or face extinction ‚Äì PART 1 on Vimeo]. Vimeo.com (9 November 2009). Retrieved on 2016-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Savulescu argues that humanity is on the brink of disappearing in a metaphorical ‚ÄòBermuda Triangle‚Äô unless humans are willing to undergo '[[moral bioenhancement |moral enhancement]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/shiseigaku/pdf/NL28-29e.pdf|title=Death and Life Studies, Fit for the Future? Modern Technology, Liberal Democracy and the Urgent Need for Moral Improvement |author=Fukuma, Satoshi |publisher=University of Tokyo Global COE Program |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2015}}

== Reception ==
Robert Sparrow wrote, in the [[Journal of Medical Ethics]], that Savulescu's justification for the principle of procreative beneficence can and should be extended further. If parents have a moral obligation to create children likely to have the best possible life, they should prefer to have children that have been genetically engineered for an optimal chance at such a life, even if those children bear little or no genetic relation to them.&lt;ref name="sparrow"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sparrow |first=Robert |date=4 April 2013 |title=In vitro eugenics|journal=[[Journal of Medical Ethics]] |volume=40 |issue=11 |pages=725‚Äì31 |doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-101200|pmid=23557913 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebecca Bennett, however, criticizes Savulescu's argument. Bennett argues that "the chances of any particular individual being born is spectacularly unlikely, given the infinite number of variables that had to be in place for this to happen. In order for any particular individual to exist, that individual's parents have to have been created in the first place, they have to meet at the right time and conceive us at a particular time to enable that particular sperm to fuse with that particular egg. Thus, it is clear that all sorts of things, any change in society, will effect who is born.". According to Bennett, this means that no-one is actually harmed if one does not select the best offspring, as the individuals born could not have had any other, worse life as they would otherwise never have been born - "choosing worthwhile but impaired lives harms no-one and is thus not less preferable", as Bennett puts it. Bennett argues that while advocates of procreative beneficence could appeal to impersonal harm, which is where one should aim to ensure the maximum possible potential quality of life and thus embryos without or with the least impairments should be selected (as the impersonal total quality of life will be improved), this argument is flawed on two counts. Firstly on an intuitive level, Bennett questions if benefit or harm that doesn't affect anyone (i.e it is impersonal) should be worthy of consideration as no actual people will gain or lose anything. Secondly and on a theoretical level, Bennett argues that attempting to increase the sum total impersonal happiness (or decrease impersonal harm) can lead to repugnant conclusions, such as being obliged to produce as many offspring as possible to bring more people into the world to raise the level of impersonal happiness, even if the quality of life of individuals suffers for it due to scarcity and overcrowding. Bennett argues that this conclusion is repugnant because "it cares little about what we normally regard as morally important: the welfare of individual people"&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Rebecca, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bioe.12044/full "When intuition is Not Enough. Why the Principle of Procreative Beneficence Must Work Much Harder to Justify Its Eugenic Vision"], Wiley Online Library, accessed 14/08/2017,&lt;/ref&gt;.

Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 30 Mar. 2013 &lt;http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/53781pg3&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her permanent appointment at Columbia, Goehr has accepted a number of visiting appointments, including a position as Visiting Ernest Bloch Professor at [[UC Berkeley]]'s music department in 1997, as the visiting Aby Warburg Professor at the [[University of Hamburg]] in 2002-2003, as a visiting professor at the [[Free University of Berlin|Freie Universit√§t]] in [[Berlin]] in 2008, and as a visiting professor in the Fu-Berlin SFB Theater und Fest in 2009.&lt;ref name=obio/&gt;

Goehr has written three books, co-edited a fourth, and has published numerous articles in the philosophy of music and critical theory. Her first book, ''The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford), was published in 1992, and has since been translated into Greek, Chinese and Italian. Her second book, ''A Quest for Voice: On Music, Politics, and the Limits of Philosophy'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford), is based on the Bloch Lectures, delivered at the University of California, Berkeley in 1997. Her third book, published in 2008, is ''Elective Affinities: Musical Essays on the History of Aesthetic Theory'' (Columbia University Press).

Goehr's work focuses on the history of aesthetic theory, attempting to understand the relational nature of norms and power dynamics with the structure that confines them and regulates their practice.&lt;ref name=apacsw&gt;{{cite web|last=DesAutels|first=Peggy|title=Lydia Goehr: November 2013|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/lydiagoehrnovember|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her work has focused on the musical arts, and some of it has explored the complicated and often hostile relationship between the various arts, and between the arts and philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;  She has also engaged with ideas about the legitimacy of war from a [[critical theory]] standpoint, as well as dealt with the [[philosophy of history]] and the [[history of philosophy]].

Goehr has received several awards for her research as well as for her teaching of undergraduate students and mentoring of graduate students. She has been a recipient of the Getty and Guggenheim Fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/search?search=goehr&amp;x=-1119&amp;y=-67 |title= Guggenheim Fellowships |publisher= Guggenheim Foundation |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/lydiagoehrnovember |title=The American Philosophical Association's Committee on the Status of Women |publisher=APA |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Goehr was awarded the H.

'''Mental projection''' is a supposed or experienced form of [[consciousness]]/[[spirit]]/[[intelligence]] projection from the emotional/[[astral plane]] to the [[mental plane]].  Adepts say they are able to project first to the emotional/astral plane (or directly from it after death) and then onward to the mental plane by completely calming their emotional processes and withdrawing their emotional senses.  Like [[astral projection]], mental projection is performed during sleep, between lives, during meditation-contemplation, or through 'psychic' (soulful) separation of the [[mental body]] from the emotional/astral body via the [[silver cord]].  Planes beyond the mental are accessible through use of the 'gold cord'.  According to many esoteric philosophers, when projecting in these higher planes one has no [[humanoid]] shape and is just a lotus- or egg-shaped '[[aura (paranormal)|auric]] body' of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E Powell (1927), ''The Mental Body'', Theosophical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain philosophers consider the mental plane optimal for projection as it is divine enough to avoid black magic and 'lower psychism' yet also grounded enough to preserve a rational quality of experience (rational but not emotionally detached; mental encloses emotional).  Others think it is better to proceed beyond humanoid form to the causal and mental auras, as these reflections of yet higher formless consciousness also transcend deeper flaws of humanity (like 'egotistic self-identification') that cause the lower psychism.  These philosophers recommend striving to project into divine consciousness, not necessarily leaving one's lower consciousness, but becoming aware of spirit and divine will.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E Powell (1972), ''The Causal Body and the Ego'', Theosophical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mikhail Aleksandrovich Lifshitz''' ({{lang-ru|–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏ÃÅ–ª –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞ÃÅ–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –õ–∏ÃÅ—Ñ—à–∏—Ü}}; July 23, 1905, in [[Melitopol]], [[Taurida Governorate|Tavria]] ([[Crimea]]) ‚Äì September 28, 1983, in [[Moscow]]) was a Soviet [[Marxism|Marxian]] [[literary criticism|literary critic]] and [[philosopher of art]] who had a long and controversial career in the former Soviet Union. In the 1930s, he strongly influenced Marxist views on aesthetics while being a close associate of [[Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs]]. He also published important compilations of early Marxist literature on the role of art. In 1975, he was elected as a full member of the [[USSR Academy of Arts]].

==Biography==
Born on July 23, 1905 in [[Melitopol]], a [[Crimea]]n city then part of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], Lifshitz began higher education as an art student at the [[Vkhutemas]] ("Higher Art and Technical Studios") in [[Moscow]] in the early 1920s, which was then the hotbed of [[Modernism]].

He ended his studies there in 1925 because he disagreed with his modernist oriented instructors. Instead, he was offered a teaching position there; his job was to teach Marxist philosophy to artists.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Russian Wikipedia article&lt;/ref&gt;

He pursued an analysis of aesthetics from a fundamentally Marxist perspective. His ideas became controversial at Vkhutemas, so he had to leave in 1930. He was offered a job instead at the Moscow's [[Marx-Engels Institute]], where he developed a working relationship with the great Marxist philosopher [[Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs]]. Lukacs, himself, admitted that he was influenced by Lifshitz' views on Marxist aesthetics.

Starting in 1933, he edited an influential Moscow magazine "The Literary Critic" (''Literaturny Kritik''),&lt;ref&gt;Gutov D., [http://www.gutov.ru/texti/kommunism_eng.htm ''Learn, learn and learn''.] In: Make Everything New - A Project on Communism. Edited by Grant Watson, Gerrie van Noord &amp; Gavin Everall. Published by Book Works and Project Arts Centre, Dublin, 2006 PP. 24-37.&lt;/ref&gt; that was also followed by Marxist art theoreticians around the world through various translations published by Soviet government.

Among the important contributors was writer [[Andrei Platonov]], one of the most intriguing writers of fiction of the Soviet period, who is often referred to as the Soviet Kafka, as well as Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs.

By 1937, Lifshitz' productivity had decreased significantly; he produced almost no published work in the repressive climate of the most intense years of [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref name = "Gutov"&gt;Gutov, Dmitriy. "–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –õ–∏—Ñ—à–∏—Ü" ("Mikhail Aleksandrovich Lifshitz"). 2003. ''Biographies''. ''Sovietika.ru''. Retrieved 25 Apr. 2009. http://www.sovetika.ru/bio/lifsh.htm {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet his magazine "The Literary Critic" continued publication until late 1940, when it was finally closed.

Following the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]] Lifshitz entered the Second World War as a [[Soviet Army|Red Army]] volunteer.&lt;ref name="Gutov"/&gt;

Early on, he saw some serious combat. His unit was surrounded by the German army, and he had to escape back through the front lines. Later on, he worked as a journalist in military publications. He received awards for his service.

===Post-war career===
His post-war career as a critic was marked by considerable controversy. In the last years of Stalin, as a Jew, he was attacked as part of the "[[Rootless cosmopolitan|campaign against Cosmopolitanism]]".

After Stalin's death in 1953, Lifshitz was in trouble again. A pamphlet he published in 1954, criticizing the writer [[Marietta Shaginyan]], now displeased the old Stalinists, and provoked the ire of the established figures of Soviet intellectual life. He was severely criticized in the press and denied employment.

According to some sources, at that stage, he was expelled from the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Gutov"/&gt; Yet he perhaps was merely severely sanctioned as a member, coming very close to expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Russian Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

His life improved after the official [[de-Stalinization]] started in 1956, and the sanctions against him were gradually lifted. Many of his works were published again.

The same time-frame was also a period of Lifshitz's collaboration with the Soviet philosopher [[Evald Ilyenkov]].

Ilyenkov's philosophy

&lt;blockquote&gt;...resembled that of Lifschitz in one important (and now almost forgotten) realm: the relationship between philosophy, culture (art, literature, music and so on) and the 'communist ideal' of a new human being, formed as a result of the political-economic changes to come...&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;Evgeni V. Pavlov (2012), [https://www.academia.edu/3039033 Review of ''Perepiska (Letters), Mikhail Lifschitz and Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs. Moscow: Grundrisse, 2011.''] '''Historical Materialism''', 20:4, 187-198&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lifshitz's main object of criticism in the 1960s was the [[Modernism|modernist]] movement in the arts. From a political vantage point, Lifshitz, despite his criticism of the Soviet system, remained a strong proponent of [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] [[socialism]].

In the early 1960s, Lifshitz gave considerable support to [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], then a beginning writer.

&lt;blockquote&gt;When in 1961 Alexander Solzhenitsyn approached [[Alexander Tvardovsky]] about the publication of his now-famous ''One Day in Life of Ivan Denisovich'' ... Tvardovsky forwarded Solzhenitsyn's manuscript to one of his oldest and most trusted friends, Mikhail Lifschitz. Lifschitz's report was unequivocal: 'It would be a crime not to publish this work'.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet later Solzhenitsyn was not kind in his remarks about him.

Early on, Lifshitz was attacked in the mainstream Soviet press because of his criticisms of Modernist art; towards the end of his career he was honoured by the mainstream, and yet strongly disliked by the Soviet non-conformist artists.

Lifshitz died in Moscow on September 28, 1983, eight years after his election as a full member of the [[USSR Academy of Arts]], the most prestigious academic artistic organization within the Soviet Union.

The vast majority of his work remains untranslated. One book on aesthetics, ''The Philosophy of Art of Karl Marx'', was published in the English translation in 1938, and republished in 1980.

Starting in the 1990s, Lifshitz acquired new popularity among the Nationalist circles in Russia, who appreciate his critique of "Western Modernist art", and his defence of traditional art. His works are being republished again.

==Contributions==
Lifschitz's collection of Marx and Engels's views on aesthetics ‚Äì ''Marx and Engels on Art'' was published in 1933 (also an extended edition of 1938) as the first anthology of its kind. It was also published in German in 1948.

In 1938, he published a similar anthology of Lenin's view on aesthetics called ''Lenin on Culture and Art''.

In 1926-1940, Lifschitz also published a very large number of works dedicated to such diverse authorities as [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], [[Francesco Guicciardini]], [[Balzac]], [[Hegel]], and [[Pushkin]].

==Early life and family background==
[[File:Taleb student.png|thumb|250px|Taleb as a student in Paris, {{c.}} 1980]]
Taleb was born in [[Amioun]], [[Lebanon]], to Minerva Ghosn and Nagib Taleb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/education.pdf |title=Fooled by Randomness ‚Äì Education |accessdate=2017-11-23 |quote=My father was known in Lebanon as the "Intelligent Student Student Intelligent", after a play on words as intelligent student (or scholar) meant "Taleb Nagib" and his name was Nagib Taleb}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[physician]]/[[oncologist]] and a researcher in [[anthropology]]. His parents were [[Greek Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]] [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] of [[Antiochian Greek Christians|Antiochian Greek origin]],&lt;ref name=GuardianInterview /&gt; holding [[French nationality law|French citizenship]]. His grandfather, Fouad Nicolas Ghosn, and his great-grandfather, Nicolas Ghosn, were both deputy prime ministers in the 1940s through the 1970s. His paternal grandfather Nassim Taleb was a supreme court judge and his great-great-great-great grandfather, Ibrahim Taleb (Nabbout), was a governor of Mount Lebanon in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/04/22/blowing-up New Yorker]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ft.com/content/86648df6-ddca-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6 Financial times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://website.aub.edu.lb/doctorates/recipients/2016/Pages/taleb.aspx American University in Beirut]&lt;/ref&gt; Taleb attended a French school there, the [[Grand Lyc√©e Franco-Libanais]] in Beirut.&lt;ref name=BakerSaid08/&gt;&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite news| last=Wighton| first=David| date=2008-03-28| title=Lunch with the FT: Nassim Nicholas Taleb| work=[[Financial Times]]| url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/2855f64c-f976-11dc-9b7c-000077b07658.html |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family saw its political prominence and wealth reduced by the [[Lebanese Civil War]], which began in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Helmore| first=Edward| date=2008-09-27| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/28/businessandfinance.philosophy | title=The new sage of Wall Street| work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taleb received his bachelor and master of science degrees from the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2D71539F932A05752C0A96E948260 |title=Cynthia Shelton, Business Student, Is Wed in Atlanta |publisher=The New York Times |date=1988-01-31 |accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds an [[MBA]] from the [[Wharton School]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1983),&lt;ref name=BakerSaid08&gt;{{cite news| first=Stephanie| last=Baker-Said| date=2008-03-27| title=Flight of the Black Swan| work=[[Bloomberg Markets]]| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=nw&amp;pname=mm_0508_story1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WallSt /&gt; and a PhD in [[Management Science]] from the [[Paris Dauphine University|University of Paris (Dauphine)]] (1998),&lt;ref name=BBKgeman&gt;BBK, 2015, "Our staff: Helyette Geman, PhD Students, Past Students," at [[Birkbeck, University of London]], Dept of Economics, Mathematics and Statistics, see [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ems/faculty/geman] and [http://www.helyettegeman.com/students], accessed 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of [[H√©lyette Geman]].&lt;ref name=BBKgeman/&gt; His dissertation focused on the mathematics of derivatives pricing.&lt;ref name=BBKgeman/&gt;&lt;ref name="DRMFinance15"&gt;{{cite web| work=DRM Finance | date=1998-06-24| author=Th√®ses Soutenes| title=Nassim Taleb, ''R√©plication d'option et structure du march√©''| url=http://www.cereg.dauphine.fr/these.php?id=107 |accessdate=2015-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518072514/http://www.cereg.dauphine.fr/these.php?id=107 |archivedate=2015-05-18 |language=French | trans-title=Replication of Options and Market Structure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finance view===

Taleb considers himself less a businessman than an [[epistemologist]] of [[randomness]], and says that he used trading to attain independence and freedom from authority.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Amy|date=2005-10-23|title=Profiting from the Unexpected|work=[[Bloomberg Business Week]]|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2005-10-23/profiting-from-the-unexpected | accessdate=2015-05-07}} {{cite web |url=http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/busweek.mht |title=Archived copy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021070352/http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/busweek.mht |archivedate=2006-10-21 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pioneer of [[black swan theory|tail risk hedging]] (now sometimes called "black swan protection"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrington |first=Shannon D. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-20/pimco-sells-black-swan-protection-as-wall-street-profits-from-selling-fear.html |title=Pimco Sells Black Swan Protection as Wall Street Markets Fear |work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] |date= 2010-07-19|accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is intended to mitigate investors' exposure to extreme market moves. His business model has been to safeguard investors against crises while reaping rewards from rare events, and thus his investment management career has included several jackpots followed by lengthy dry spells.&lt;ref name=BakerSaid08/&gt;

He has also held the following positions:&lt;ref name=NassimTaleb37&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Home Page, [http://fooledbyrandomness.com/CV.htm "Official Academic Biography"], at ''fooledbyrandomness.com'' (online), accessed 9 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Home Page, [http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/pictures_files/ Professional Information], at ''fooledbyrandomness.com'', accessed 9 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taleb Outsells Greenspan as Black Swan Gives Worst Turbulence|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aHfkhe8.C._8|work=[[Bloomberg News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; managing director and proprietary trader at Credit Suisse [[UBS AG|UBS]], worldwide chief proprietary arbitrage derivatives [[trader (finance)|trader]] for [[foreign exchange market|currencies]], [[commodity market|commodities]] and non-dollar fixed income at [[First Boston Corporation|First Boston]], chief currency derivatives trader for [[Banque Indosuez]], managing director and worldwide head of financial [[option (finance)|option]] [[arbitrage]] at [[CIBC Wood Gundy]], derivatives arbitrage trader at [[Bankers Trust]] (now [[Deutsche Bank]]), proprietary trader at [[BNP Paribas]], independent option market maker on the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] and founder of [[Empirica Capital]].

Taleb reportedly became [[financial independence|financially independent]] after the crash of 1987&lt;ref name="BakerSaid08" /&gt; and was successful during the [[NASDAQ|Nasdaq]] dive in 2000&lt;ref name=BW /&gt; as well as the [[financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010|financial crisis that began in 2007]],&lt;ref name=WallSt /&gt; a development which he attributed to the mismatch between reality and statistical distributions used in finance. Following this crisis, Taleb became an activist for what he called a "black swan robust society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fbaff18c-23d2-11de-996a-00144feabdc0.html |title=Ten principles for a Black Swan-proofworld |work=[[The Financial Times]] |date=2009-04-08 |accessdate=2009-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228215819/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fbaff18c-23d2-11de-996a-00144feabdc0.html |archivedate=2013-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web|first=Marion|last=Maneker|date=2009-03-26|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|work=The Big Money |url=http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/judgments/2009/03/26/mr-taleb-goes-washington |title=Mr. Taleb goes to Washington |accessdate=2015-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419125636/http://www.marionmaneker.com/2009/03/mr-taleb-goes-to-washington/ |archivedate=2016-04-19 |df= }} and [http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/maneker.pdf Additional archive], accessed 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 he has been a Principal/Senior Scientific Adviser at [[Universa Investments]] in [[Santa Monica, California]], a fund which is based on the "black swan" idea, owned and managed by former Empirica partner [[Mark Spitznagel]].

Taleb's five volume philosophical essay on uncertainty, titled the ''Incerto'', covers the following books: ''Fooled by Randomness'' (2001), ''The Black Swan'' (2007‚Äì2010), ''The Bed of Procrustes'' (2010), ''Antifragile'' (2012), and ''Skin in the Game'' (2018). It was originally published in November 2016 including only the first four books. The fifth book has not been included in a separate release of the series.

His first non-technical book, ''[[Fooled by Randomness]]'', about the underestimation of the role of randomness in life, published in 2001, was selected by [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'']] as one of the smartest 75 books known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Useem|first=Jerry|title=The Smartest Books We Know |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/03/21/8254826/index.htm|accessdate=28 August 2013 |newspaper=Fortune|date=21 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second non-technical book, ''[[The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable|The Black Swan]]'', about unpredictable events, was published in 2007, selling close to 3 million copies (as of February 2011). It spent 36 weeks on the [[New York Times Bestseller list]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_10/b4218047676960.htm |title=Charlie Rose Talks to Nassim Taleb |publisher=[[Business Week]] |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 17 as hardcover and 19 weeks as paperback,&lt;ref name=BakerSaid08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-01-16/paperback-nonfiction/list.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jennifer | last=Schuessler | title=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was translated into 31 languages.&lt;ref name=BakerSaid08/&gt; The book has been credited with predicting the [[Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008|banking and economic crisis]] of 2008.&lt;ref name=GuardianInterview&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Carole Cadwalladr|first=Carole|last=Cadwalladr|date=2012-11-24|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/24/nassim-taleb-antifragile-finance-interview |title=Nassim Taleb: my rules for life|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BrooksOpEdNYT&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=David Brooks (cultural commentator)|first=David|last=Brooks|work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=Not only did Taleb have an explanation for the crisis, but he saw it coming|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/opinion/28brooks.html?_r=0|title=The Behavioral Revolution|date=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book of [[aphorism]]s, ''[[The Bed of Procrustes|The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms]]'', was released in December 2010.

The fourth book of his ''Incerto'' series‚Äî''[[Antifragile|Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder]]''‚Äîwas published in November 2012.&lt;ref name="TalebAntifragile12" /&gt;

The fifth book of his ''Incerto'' series‚Äî''[[Skin in the Game (book)|Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life]]''‚Äîwas published in February 2018. It has not yet been included in an updated release of ''Incerto''.

Taleb's non-technical writing style has been described as mixing a narrative, often semi-autobiographical style with short philosophical tales and historical and scientific commentary. The sales of Taleb's first two books garnered an advance of $4 million, for a follow-up book on anti-fragility.&lt;ref name=BakerSaid08/&gt;

==Ideas and theories==
Taleb's book ''[[The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms|The Bed of Procrustes]]'' summarizes the central problem: "we humans, facing limits of knowledge, and things we do not observe, the unseen and the unknown, resolve the tension by squeezing life and the world into crisp commoditized ideas". Taleb disagrees with [[Plato]]nic (i.e., theoretical) approaches to reality to the extent that they lead people to have the wrong [[Map‚Äìterritory relation|map]] of reality, rather than no map at all.&lt;ref name=Mouth /&gt; He opposes most economic and grand social science theorizing, which in his view, suffers acutely from the problem of overuse of Plato's ''[[Theory of Forms]]''. Based on these and other constructions, he advocates for what he calls a "black swan robust" society, meaning a society that can withstand difficult-to-predict events.&lt;ref name=swans /&gt;

He has also proposed that biological, economic, and other systems exhibit an ability to benefit and grow from volatility‚Äîincluding particular types of random errors and events‚Äîa characteristic of these systems that he terms ''[[antifragility]].''&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Danchin, Philippe M. Binder, &amp; Stanislas Noria, 2011, [https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/2/4/998 Antifragility and Tinkering in Biology (and in Business) Flexibility Provides an Efficient Epigenetic Way to Manage Risk], Genes '''2'''(4):998-1016, DOI 10.3390/genes2040998Review, accessed 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Danchin, 2012, [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-anti-fragile-life-of-the-economy Innovation &amp; Technology: The Anti-Fragile Life of the Economy], at ''Project Syndicate'' (online), April 2, 2012, accessed 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, he also believes that universities are better at public relations and claiming credit than generating knowledge. He argues that knowledge and technology are usually generated by what he calls "[[stochastic]] tinkering" rather than by top-down directed research,&lt;ref&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb, 2001, [http://edge.org/q2007/q07_5.html#taleb The Birth of Stochastic Science], at ''Edge'' (online), September 11, 2001, accessed 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ma'n BarƒÅzƒ´, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr0tAQAAIAAJ Lebanon's rational fools: From the roots of the "economic qabaday" till the 2009 depression election‚Ä¶ conflicting tale of paradigms and economic change], Beirut, Lebanon:Data &amp; Investment Consult-Lebanon, p. 182, accessed 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|182}} and has proposed option-like experimentation as a way to outperform directed research as a method of scientific discovery, an approach he terms ''convex tinkering.''&lt;ref name=TalebAntifragile12&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb, 2012, ''[[Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder]],'' [[Random House]] ({{ISBN|0679645276}}) and [[Penguin Books]] ({{ISBN|0718197909}}), accessed 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181''ff'', 213''ff'', 236''ff''}}

Taleb has called for cancellation of the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]], saying that the damage from economic theories can be devastating.&lt;ref&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb, 2007, "Opinion: The pseudo-science hurting markets," at ''[[Financial Times]]'' (online), October 23, 2007, see [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4eb6ae86-8166-11dc-a351-0000779fd2ac.html#axzz3ZT5dpIEI] and [http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/FT-Nobel.pdf], accessed 7 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox| first=Adam | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68R2SK20100928 |title=Blame Nobel for crisis, says author of 'Black Swan|work=[[Reuters]]|date=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opposes top-down knowledge as an academic illusion.&lt;ref name="econtalk"&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2009/03/taleb_on_the_fi.html |title=Taleb on the Financial Crisis|host=Russ Roberts|work=The Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Espen Gaarder Haug, Taleb asserts that option pricing is determined in a "heuristic way" by operators, not by a model, and that models are "lecturing birds on how to fly".&lt;ref name="econtalk" /&gt; Teacher and author Pablo Triana has explored this topic with reference to Haug and Taleb,&lt;ref&gt;Triana, Pablo. ''Lecturing Birds on Flying: Can Mathematical Theories Destroy the Financial Markets?'' Wiley Publishing (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and says that perhaps Taleb is correct to urge that banks be treated as [[public utility|utilities]] forbidden to take potentially lethal risks, while hedge funds and other unregulated entities should be able to do what they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garcia|first=Cardiff de Alejo|url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2009-06-12/q-and-a-part-ii-alternatives-to-measuring-risk |title=Q&amp;A Part II: Alternatives to measuring risk|work=[[Financial News]]|date=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taleb's writings discuss the error of comparing real-world randomness with the "structured randomness" in [[quantum physics]] where probabilities are remarkably computable and games of chance like casinos where probabilities are artificially built.&lt;ref name=Cornwell&gt;{{cite news|last=Cornwell|first=John|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article1708246.ece |title=Random thoughts on the road to riches|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taleb calls this the "[[ludic fallacy]]". His argument centers on the idea that predictive models are based on Plato's ''Theory of Forms'', gravitating towards mathematical purity and failing to take some key ideas into account, such as: the impossibility of possessing all relevant information, that small unknown variations in the data can have a huge impact, and flawed theories/models that are based on empirical data and that fail to consider events that have not taken place, but could have taken place. Discussing the ludic fallacy in ''The Black Swan'', he writes, "The dark side of the moon is harder to see; beaming light on it costs energy. In the same way, beaming light on the unseen is costly, in both computational and mental effort."

In the second edition of ''The Black Swan'', he posited that the foundations of [[quantitative analyst|quantitative economics]] are faulty and highly self-referential. He states that statistics is fundamentally incomplete as a field, as it cannot predict the risk of rare events, a problem that is acute in proportion to the rarity of these events. With the mathematician [[Raphael Douady]], he called the problem ''statistical undecidability'' (Douady and Taleb, 2010).

Taleb sees his main challenge as mapping his ideas of "robustification" and "[[antifragility]]", that is, how to live and act in a world we do not understand and build robustness to black swan events. Taleb introduced the idea of the "fourth quadrant" in the exposure domain.&lt;ref&gt;Taleb, N. N. (2009). Errors, robustness, and the fourth quadrant. [http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeintfor/v_3a25_3ay_3a2009_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a744-759.htm International Journal of Forecasting, 25(4), 744‚Äì59]&lt;/ref&gt; One of its applications is in his definition of the most effective (that is, least fragile) risk management approach: what he calls the 'barbell' strategy which is based on avoiding the middle in favor of linear combination of extremes, across all domains from politics to economics to one's personal life. These are deemed by Taleb to be more robust to estimation errors. For instance, he suggests that investing money in 'medium risk' investments is pointless, because risk is difficult, if not impossible to compute. His preferred strategy is to be both hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive at the same time. For example, an investor might put 80 to 90% of their money in extremely safe instruments, such as treasury bills, with the remainder going into highly risky and diversified speculative bets. An alternative suggestion is to engage in highly speculative bets with a limited downside.

Taleb asserts that by adopting these strategies a portfolio can be "robust", that is, gain a positive exposure to black swan events while limiting losses suffered by such random events.&lt;ref&gt;Taleb, ''The Black Swan'', pg 207&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|207}} Together with [[Donald Geman]] and [[H√©lyette Geman]], he modeled the "maximum entropy barbell" which consists in "to constrain only what can be constrained (in a robust manner) and to maximize entropy elsewhere", based on an insight by E.T. Jaynes that economic life increases in entropy under regulatory and other constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Geman | first1 = D. | last2 = Geman | first2 = H. | last3 = Taleb | first3 = N.

Instead of doing steady and moderate exercise daily, he suggests that it is better to do a low-effort exercise such as walking slowly most of the time, while occasionally expending extreme effort. He claims that the human body evolved to live in a random environment, with various unexpected but intense efforts and much rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nassim Nicholas|last=Taleb |year=2012 |title=[[Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder]] |publisher=[[Random House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his work on finance and probability, Taleb touches upon many current issues such as employment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@nntaleb/how-to-legally-own-another-person-4145a1802bf6#.bwinmpawr|title=How To Legally Own Another Person|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the state of academia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/incerto/an-expert-called-lindy-fdb30f146eaf#.pl6sr2xrx|title=An Expert Called Lindy|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Syrian War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/opacity/the-syrian-war-condensed-a-more-rigorous-way-to-look-at-the-conflict-f841404c3b1d#.g0daphvoh|title=The Syrian War Condensed: A more Rigorous Way to Look at the Conflict|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taleb wrote in [[Antifragile]] and in scientific papers &lt;ref&gt;Taleb, N. N. (2018, July). (Anti) Fragility and Convex Responses in Medicine. In International Conference on Complex Systems (pp. 299-325). Springer, Cham.&lt;/ref&gt; that if the statistical structure of habits in modern society differ too greatly from the ancestral environment of humanity,  the analysis of consumption should focus less on composition and more than the frequency. In other words,  studies that ignore the random nature of supply of nutrients are invalid.

==Praise and criticism==
In a 2008 article in ''[[The Times]]'', the journalist [[Bryan Appleyard]] described Taleb as "now the hottest thinker in the world".&lt;ref name="business.timesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article4022091.ece | work=[[The Times]] | location=London | title=Nassim Nicholas Taleb the prophet of boom and doom | first=Bryan | last=Appleyard | authorlink=Bryan Appleyard|date=2008-06-01 | accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] Laureate [[Daniel Kahneman]] proposed the inclusion of Taleb's name among the world's top intellectuals, saying "Taleb has changed the way many people think about uncertainty, particularly in the financial markets. His book, ''The Black Swan'', is an original and audacious analysis of the ways in which humans try to make sense of unexpected events."&lt;ref name=kahneman&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4365 |first=Daniel|last=Kahneman|authorlink=Daniel Kahneman|title=How Could You Not Include...|work=[[Foreign Policy]] |date= 2008|accessdate=2009-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329025248/http://www.foreignpolicy.com:80/story/cms.php?story_id=4365 |archivedate=2009-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taleb was treated as a "rock star" at the [[World Economic Forum]] annual meeting in [[Davos]] in 2009; at that event he had harsh words for bankers, suggesting that "it is time for some punishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Ignatius|authorlink=David Ignatius| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/30/AR2009013002726.html |title=Humbled Economic Masters at Davos |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date= 2009-02-01|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Redburn |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/a-rallying-cry-to-claw-back-bonuses/ |title=A Rallying Cry to Claw Back Bonuses |work=[[DealBook]]|publisher=The New York Times |date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taleb contends that statisticians can be [[pseudoscientists]] when it comes to risks of rare events and risks of blowups, and mask their incompetence with complicated equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edge.org/response-detail/23839 |title=What We Learn From Firefighters |publisher=[[Edge Foundation, Inc.]] |date= 2013 |accessdate=2015-05-07|last=Taleb|first=Nassim Nicholas|quote=Simply, one observation in 10,000, that is, one day in 40 years, can explain the bulk of the "[[kurtosis]]", a measure of what we call "[[fat tail]]s", that is, how much the distribution under consideration departs from the standard [[normal distribution|Gaussian]], or the role of remote events in determining the total properties. For the U.S. stock market, a single day, [[Black Monday (1987)|the crash of 1987]], determined 80% of the kurtosis. The same problem is found with interest and exchange rates, commodities, and other variables. The problem is not just that the data had "fat tails", something people knew but sort of wanted to forget; it was that we would never be able to determine "how fat" the tails were. Never. The implication is that those tools used in economics that are based on squaring variables (more technically, the [[Euclidean norm|Euclidean]], or [[norm (mathematics)#p-norm|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; norm]]), such as [[standard deviation]], variance, correlation, regression, or value-at-risk, the kind of stuff you find in textbooks, are not valid scientifically (except in some rare cases where the variable is bounded). The so-called "[[p value]]s" you find in studies have no meaning with economic and financial variables. Even the more sophisticated techniques of [[stochastic calculus]] used in mathematical finance do not work in economics except in selected pockets.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stance has attracted criticism: the [[American Statistical Association]] devoted the August 2007 issue of ''The American Statistician'' to ''The Black Swan''. The magazine offered a mixture of praise and criticism for Taleb's main points, with a focus on Taleb's writing style and his representation of the statistical literature. Robert Lund, a mathematics professor at [[Clemson University]], writes that in ''Black Swan'', Taleb is "reckless at times and subject to grandiose overstatements; the professional statistician will find the book ubiquitously naive."&lt;ref name=lund:00&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lund | first1 = Robert | year = 2007 | title = Revenge of the white swan | url = | journal = [[American Statistician]] | volume = 61 | issue = 4| pages = 189‚Äì92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aaron Brown (financial author)|Aaron Brown]], an author, [[quantitative analysis (finance)|quantitative analyst]], and finance professor at [[Yeshiva University|Yeshiva]] and [[Fordham University|Fordham]] Universities, said that "the book reads as if Taleb has never heard of [[non-parametric statistics|nonparametric methods]], [[data analysis]], visualization tools or [[robust statistics|robust estimation]]."&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Aaron | authorlink = Aaron Brown (financial author) | year = 2007 | title = Strong language on black swans | url = | journal = [[American Statistician]] | volume = 61 | issue = 3| pages = 195‚Äì97 | doi=10.1198/000313007x220011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he calls the book "essential reading" and urges statisticians to overlook the insults to get the "important philosophic and mathematical truths." Taleb replied in the second edition of ''The Black Swan'' that "One of the most common (but useless) comments I hear is that some solutions can come from 'robust statistics.' I wonder how using these techniques can create information where there is none".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable|Black Swan]]'', 2nd, edition, p.&amp;nbsp;353&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|353}} While praising the book, Westfall and [[Joseph Hilbe|Hilbe]] in 2007 complained that Taleb's criticism is "often unfounded and sometimes outrageous."&lt;ref name=westfall&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Westfall | first1 = P. | last2 = Hilbe | first2 = J.|authorlink2=Joseph Hilbe | year = 2007 | title = The Black Swan: Praise and Criticism | url = https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/000313007X219383 | journal = [[American Statistician]] | volume = 61 | issue = 3| pages = 193‚Äì194 | doi=10.1198/000313007x219383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taleb, writes [[John Kay (economist)|John Kay]], "describes writers and professionals as knaves or fools, mostly fools. His writing is full of irrelevances, asides and colloquialisms, reading like the conversation of a raconteur rather than a tightly argued thesis. But it is hugely enjoyable ‚Äì compelling but easy to dip into. Yet beneath his rage and mockery are serious issues. The risk management models in use today exclude the very events against which they claim to protect the businesses that employ them. These models import a veneer of technical sophistication... Quantitative analysts have lulled corporate executives and regulators into an illusory sense of security."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=John Kay (economist)|first=John|last=Kay|date=2007-04-27|title=Books: Unimaginable horror [Book review of ''The Black Swan'']|work=[[Financial Times]]|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/824ac36c-f134-11db-838b-000b5df10621.html#axzz2HKRVAHY3|accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley statistician [[David Freedman (statistician)|David Freedman]] said that efforts by statisticians to refute Taleb's stance have been unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~census/crow.pdf |format=PDF |title=Black Ravens, White Shoes, and Case Selection |authorlink=David Freedman (statistician)|first=David A.|last=Freedman |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taleb and Nobel laureate [[Myron Scholes]] have traded personal attacks, particularly after Taleb's paper with Espen Haug on why nobody used the [[Black‚ÄìScholes model|Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton formula]]. Taleb said that Scholes was responsible for the financial crises of 2008, and suggested that "this guy should be in a retirement home doing [[Sudoku]]. His funds have blown up twice. He shouldn't be allowed in Washington to lecture anyone on risk."&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; Scholes retorted that Taleb simply "popularises ideas and is making money selling books". Scholes claimed that Taleb does not cite previous literature, and for this reason Taleb is not taken seriously in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anuj|last=Gangahar|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/fb971062-0b4c-11dd-8ccf-0000779fd2ac.html|title=Mispriced risk tests market faith in a prized formula|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haug and Taleb (2011) listed hundreds of research documents showing the Black‚ÄìScholes formula was not Scholes' at all, and argued that the economics establishment ignored literature by practitioners and mathematicians (such as [[Ed Thorp]]), who had developed a more sophisticated version of the formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/SM/MATH3075/r/Haug_Taleb_2011.pdf |title=Option traders use (very) sophisticated heuristics, never the Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton formula |work=[[Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on ''[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]]'', Taleb said that he saw that none of the criticism he received for ''The Black Swan'' refuted his central point, which convinced him to protect his assets and those of his clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://charlierose.com/videos/15268 |title=Author Nassim Taleb examines rare events, risk management and his book, "The Black Swan" |publisher=[[Charlie Rose]]|work=[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-21 |quote="When my book came out, I started listening to the criticism, and I realized that nobody attacked my central point. I thought that someone would come up with some convincing argument. Two, three months after the publication, I went for the jugular. I said, this thing is going to go. And, in fact&amp;nbsp;‚Äì so."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taleb's aggressive and clearly directed commentary against parts of the finance industry‚Äîe.g., stating at Davos in 2009 that he was "happy" that [[Lehman Brothers]] collapsed‚Äîhas led to reports of personal attacks and possible threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123457658749086809 | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | title=Overheard | date=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 commencement address ==
Taleb received an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] doctorate from the [[American University of Beirut]] in 2016 and  gave a [[commencement address]] to the graduating class in which, describing his life, he stated:

{{quote|I hesitate to give advice because every major single piece of advice I was given turned out to be wrong and I am glad I didn't follow them. I was told to focus and I never did. I was told to never procrastinate and I waited 20 years for the Black Swan and it sold 3 million copies. I was told to avoid putting fictional characters in my books and I did put in Nero Tulip and Fat Tony because I got bored otherwise. I was told to not insult the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, the more I insulted them the nicer they were to me and solicit Op-Eds. I was told to avoid lifting weights for a back pain and became a weightlifter: never had a back problem since.
If I had to relive my life I would be even more stubborn and uncompromising than I have been. One should never do anything without skin in the game. If you give advice, you need to be exposed to losses from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aub.edu.lb/commencement/Documents/speeches-16/nassim-taleb.pdf |title=Nassim Taleb: Commencement Address 2016 |publisher=American University of Beirut |date=May 27, 2016 |accessdate=June 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Overbelief''' (also written as "''over-belief''") is a [[philosophical]] term&lt;ref&gt;"Overbelief." Merriam-Webster.com. Accessed June 3, 2014. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/overbelief.&lt;/ref&gt; for a belief adopted that requires more evidence than one presently has. Generally, acts of overbelief are justified on emotional need or [[faith]], and a need to make sense of spiritual experience, rather than on empirical  [[evidence]]. This idea originates from the works of William James in [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/621 The Varieties of Religious Experience] online text&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the conceptual framework that individuals have. For James, a typical example of an overbelief would be R. W. Trine's contention that "The great central fact of the universe is that spirit of infinite life and power that is back of all, that manifests itself in and through all." James acknowledges that his own over-beliefs are so minimal that to some religious believers they may seem like "under-beliefs".

'''Peter K. Unger''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà| å|≈ã|g|…ôr}}; born April 25, 1942) is a contemporary American [[philosopher]] and professor at [[New York University]]. His main interests lie in the fields of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], and the [[philosophy of mind]].

==Biography==
Unger attended [[Swarthmore College]] at the same time as [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], earning a B.A. in philosophy in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/x10310.xml |title=Swarthmore College :: Philosophy :: Department Alumni with PHIL Ph.D.s |accessdate=2009-03-05 |publisher=Swarthmore College |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oxford University]], where he studied under [[A. J. Ayer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2001/11/19/Thinking-about-life-Peter-Unger/UPI-99161006217214/ |title=UPI Article: Thinking about life: Peter Unger |accessdate=2011-12-12 |publisher=[[UPI]] |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a doctorate in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/peterunger |title=NYU &gt; Philosophy &gt; Unger, Peter |accessdate=2009-03-05 |publisher=New York University |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unger has written a defense of profound [[philosophical skepticism]]. In ''Ignorance'' (1975), he argues that nobody knows anything and even that nobody is reasonable or justified in believing anything.

In ''Philosophical Relativity'' (1984), he argues that many philosophical questions cannot be definitively answered.

In the field of applied ethics, his best-known work is ''[[Living High and Letting Die]]'' (1996). In this text, Unger argues that the citizens of first-world countries have a [[moral obligation|moral duty]] to make large donations to life-saving charities (such as [[Oxfam]] and [[UNICEF]]), and that once they have given all of their own money and possessions, beyond what is needed to survive, they should give what belongs to others, even if having to beg, borrow, or steal in the process.

In "The Mental Problems of the Many" (2002), he argues for substantial interactionist dualism on questions of mind and matter: that each of us is an immaterial soul.   The argument is extended and fortified in his 2006 book ''All the Power in the World''.

In ''Empty Ideas'' (2014), he argues that [[analytic philosophy]] has delivered no substantial results as to how things are with concrete reality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12821">'''Pseudoskepticism''' (or '''pseudoscepticism''') is a philosophical or scientific position which appears to be that of [[skepticism]] or [[scientific skepticism]] but which in reality fails to be so.

==Nineteenth and early twentieth centuries==
An early use of the word was in self-denigration: on 31 August 1869, Swiss philosopher [[Henri-Fr√©d√©ric Amiel]] wrote in his diary:
{{quote|My instinct is in harmony with the pessimism of Buddha and of [[Schopenhauer]]. It is a doubt which never leaves me, even in my moments of religious fervor. Nature is indeed for me a [[Maya (illusion)|Ma√Øa]]; and I look at her, as it were, with the eyes of an artist. My intelligence remains skeptical. What, then, do I believe in? I do not know. And what is it I hope for? It would be difficult to say. Folly! I believe in goodness, and I hope that good will prevail. Deep within this ironical and disappointed being of mine there is a child hidden ‚Äî a frank, sad, simple creature, who believes in the ideal, in love, in holiness, and all heavenly superstitions. A whole millennium of idyls sleeps in my heart; I am a pseudo-skeptic, a pseudo-scoffer.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dudley Warner, Editor, ''Library Of The World's Best Literature Ancient And Modern, Vol. II'', 1896. Online at Project Gutenberg (e.g. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12788/12788-8.txt here])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It soon acquired its usual meaning where a claimed skeptic is accused of excessive sureness in turning initial doubts into certainties. In 1908 [[Henry Louis Mencken]] wrote on [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s criticism of philosopher [[David Strauss]] that:
{{quote|Strauss had been a preacher but had renounced the cloth and set up shop as a critic of Christianity. He had labored with good intentions, no doubt, but the net result of all his smug agnosticism was that his disciples were as self-satisfied, bigoted, and prejudiced in the garb of agnostics as they had been before as Christians. Nietzsche's eye saw this and in the first of his little pamphlets "David Strauss, der Bekenner und der Schriftsteller" ("David Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer"), he bore down on Strauss's bourgeoise pseudo-skepticism most savagely. This was 1873.&lt;ref&gt;H. L. (Henry Louis) Mencken, ''The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche'' (1908) publ. T.F. Unwin. Reprinted in ''Friedrich Nietzsche'', Originally published: Boston : Luce and Co., 1913. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_r71AzHvf64C&amp;vid=ISBN1560006498&amp;dq=%22pseudo+skepticism%22&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;sig=GmCpU7uH_ZS-fJj_BF8vtbnaHrk&amp;q=%22pseudo+skepticism%22 p.30].&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Professor of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, Frederick L. Will used the term "pseudo-skepticism" in 1942. [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] writes:
{{quote|[Frederick] Will was no exception. He began as an analytical philosopher, distinguishing different uses of language with the aim of showing that certain traditional philosophical problems need no longer trouble us, once we have understood how to make the relevant linguistic distinctions. The enemies were two: the philosophical skeptic who poses these false problems and the philosopher who thinks that the skeptic needs to be answered. So in "Is there a Problem of Induction?" (''Journal of Philosophy'', 1942) it is two senses of "know" that are to be distinguished: "All the uneasiness, the pseudo-skepticism and the pseudo-problem of induction, would never appear if it were possible to keep clear that 'know' in the statement that we do not know statements about the future is employed in a very special sense, not at all its ordinary one.&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre "[https://eastanglia.academia.edu/KennethRWestphal/Books/8825/F._L._Will_Pragmatism_and_Realism Foreword]" to the book ''Pragmatism and Realism'' by Frederick L. Will (1997) quoting his earlier paper "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2017379 Is There a Problem of Induction?]" ''Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 39, No. 19 (September 10, 1942), pp. 505-513&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] Professor of English, John E. Sitter used the term in 1977 in a discussion of [[Alexander Pope]]: "Pope's intent, I believe, is to chasten the reader's skepticism ‚Äî the pseudo-skepticism of the overly confident 'you' ... "&lt;ref&gt;John E. Sitter, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/450077 The Argument of Pope's Epistle to Cobham]" ''Studies in English Literature, 1500-1900'', Vol. 17, No. 3, Restoration and Eighteenth Century (Summer, 1977), pp. 435-449&lt;/ref&gt;

==Truzzi==
In 1987, [[Marcello Truzzi]] revived the term specifically for arguments which use scientific-sounding language to disparage or refute given beliefs, theories, or claims, but which in fact fail to follow the precepts of conventional [[skepticism|scientific skepticism]]. He argued that scientific skepticism is agnostic to new ideas, making no claims about them but waiting for them to satisfy a burden of proof before granting them validity. Pseudoskepticism, by contrast, involves "negative hypotheses"‚Äîtheoretical assertions that some belief, theory, or claim is factually wrong‚Äîwithout satisfying the burden of proof that such negative theoretical assertions would require.&lt;ref name="truzzi1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Truzzi | first = Marcello | authorlink= Marcello Truzzi | url = http://www.anomalist.com/commentaries/pseudo.html | title = On Pseudo-Skepticism | year = 1987 | journal = Zetetic Scholar | issue = 12/13 | pages = 3‚Äì4| accessdate = 2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/289894041.html?dids=289894041:289894041&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+15,+2003&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&amp;desc=MARCELLO+TRUZZI+|+Helped+form+the+Committee+for+the+Scientific+Investigation+of+Claims+of+the+Paranormal;+67&amp;pqatl=google "Marcello Truzzi: Helped form the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal"], ''[[The San Diego Union Tribune]]'', February 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/2007-10-11/art-books/marla-vs-pollock-who-s-the-fraudiest/ "Marla vs. Pollock: Who‚Äôs the Fraudiest?"] ''[[LA Weekly]]'', October 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2877850/The-plain-truth-about-legal.html "The plain truth about legal truth"] ''[[Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy]]'', January 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, while working as a professor of [[sociology]] at [[Eastern Michigan University]], Truzzi gave the following description of pseudoskeptics in the journal ''Zetetic Scholar'' (which he founded):
{{quotation|In science, the burden of proof falls upon the claimant; and the  more extraordinary a claim, the heavier is the burden of proof demanded. The true skeptic takes an agnostic position, one that says the claim is not proved rather than disproved. He asserts that the claimant has not borne the burden of  proof and that science must continue to build its [[cognitive map]] of reality without incorporating the extraordinary claim as a new "fact." Since the true skeptic does not assert a claim, he has no burden to prove anything. He just goes on using the established theories of "conventional science" as usual. But  if a critic asserts that there is evidence for disproof, that he has a negative hypothesis‚Äîsaying, for instance, that a seeming [[Psi (parapsychology)|psi]] [[Experiment|result]] was actually due to an artifact‚Äîhe is making a claim and therefore also has to bear a burden  of proof...

Both critics and proponents need to learn to think of [[adjudication]] in science as more like that found in the law courts, imperfect and with varying degrees of proof and evidence.  Absolute truth, like absolute justice,  is seldom obtainable. We can only do our best to approximate them.
|Marcello Truzzi|"On Pseudo-Skepticism", ''Zetetic Scholar'', 12/13, pp3-4, 1987&lt;ref name="truzzi1"/&gt;}}

Truzzi attributed the following characteristics to pseudoskeptics:&lt;ref name="truzzi1"/&gt;
#Denying, when only doubt has been established
#Double standards in the application of criticism
#The tendency to discredit rather than investigate
#Presenting insufficient evidence or proof
#Assuming criticism requires no burden of proof
#Making unsubstantiated counter-claims
#Counter-claims based on plausibility rather than empirical evidence
#Suggesting that unconvincing evidence provides grounds for completely dismissing a claim

He characterized true skepticism as:&lt;ref name="truzzi1"/&gt;
#Acceptance of doubt when neither assertion nor denial has been established
#No burden of proof to take an agnostic position
#Agreement that the corpus of established knowledge must be based on what is proved, but recognising its incompleteness
#Even-handedness in requirement for proofs, whatever their implication
#Accepting that a failure of a proof in itself proves nothing
#Continuing examination of the results of experiments even when flaws are found

== Subsequent usage ==
[[Psychiatrist]] Richard Kluft noted that pseudoskepticism can inhibit research progress:
{{quote|".. today genuine skepticism of the benign sort that looks evenly in all directions and encourages the advancement of knowledge seems vanishingly rare. Instead, we find a prevalence of pseudo-skepticism consisting of harsh and invidious skepticism toward one's opponents' points of view and observations, and egregious self-congratulatory confirmatory bias toward one's own stances and findings misrepresented as the earnest and dispassionate pursuit of clinical, scholarly, and scientific truth."&lt;ref&gt;Kluft, Richard P., "Editorial: Building upon our foundations" (June 1994) in [https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/1508 ''Dissociation'', Vol. 7, No. 2, p. 079-080], publ. Ridgeview Institute and the International Society for the Study of Dissociation&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Susan Blackmore]], who lost her initial belief in  [[parapsychology]] and in 1991 became a [[CSICOP]] fellow, later described what she termed the "worst kind of pseudoskepticism":
{{quote|There are some members of the skeptics‚Äô groups who clearly believe they know the right answer prior to inquiry. They appear not to be interested in weighing alternatives, investigating strange claims, or trying out psychic experiences or altered states for themselves (heaven forbid!), but only in promoting their own particular belief structure and cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;JE Kennedy, "[http://jeksite.org/psi/jp03.pdf The Capricious, Actively Evasive, Unsustainable Nature of Psi: A Summary and Hypotheses]", ''The Journal of Parapsychology'', Volume 67, pp. 53‚Äì74, 2003. See Note 1 page 64 quoting Blackmore, S. J. (1994). Women skeptics. In L. Coly &amp; R. White (Eds.), ''Women and parapsychology'' (pp. 234‚Äì236). New York: Parapsychology Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hugo Anthony Meynell]] from the Department of Religious Studies at the [[University of Calgary]], labels the "extreme position that all significant evidence supporting paranormal phenomena is a result of deception or lies" as pseudoskepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Stoeber, Hugo Anthony Meynell, ''Critical Reflections on the Paranormal'', SUNY Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-7914-3063-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3063-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=c_A_wfFe-CoC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=Pseudo-skepticism&amp;sig=ACfU3U372C-YJbYhNmNzNYVOmlVA78cnmQ#PPA16,M1 page 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Truzzi's characterization was aimed at the holders of majority views who he considered were excessively impatient of minority opinions, the term has been used to describe advocates of minority intellectual positions who engage in pseudoskeptical behavior when they characterize themselves as "skeptics" despite [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] evidence that conforms to a preexisting belief. Thus according to Richard Cameron Wilson, some advocates of [[AIDS denial]] are indulging in "bogus scepticism" when they argue in this way.&lt;ref name=Wilson_NS&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2008/09/evidence-sceptic-hiv-bogus Richard Wilson, "Against the Evidence"], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 18 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson argues that the characteristic feature of false skepticism is that it "centres not on an impartial search for the truth, but on the defence of a preconceived ideological position".&lt;ref name=Wilson_fooled&gt;Richard C. Wilson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ARNNLgAACAAJ&amp; "Don't get fooled again: the sceptic's guide to life"], ''Icon'', 2008, {{ISBN|1-84831-014-5}}, 240 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4300">The '''Ramsey‚ÄìLewis method''' is a method for defining terms found in [[theory|theoretical framework]]s (such as in [[scientific theory|scientific theories]]), credited to [[Frank P. Ramsey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramsey|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using this method, a set of theoretical terms appearing in a [[theory]] can be defined implicitly by the assertions of the theory itself.

==Overview==
A [[scientific theory]] which attempts to describe "[[electron]]s" is inherently abstract, as no one has ever observed an electron directly. Thus, the origin and content of the concept of "electron" is questionable. What does the word exactly signify? Ramsey and Lewis proposed that the meaning of the term "electron" is implicitly generated by the scientific theory that describes it, via all its assertions about electrons. Electrons are those things about which all the statements of the theory are true.

However, some of those statements in a theory refer to other unobserved entities and properties such as "charge" or "spin". For instance, "Electrons attract [[proton]]s" and "Electrons have negative charge" employ the terms "protons" and "negative charge" (with the latter also implicitly using the concept of "charge"). These properties are formalized, statements (such as [[Causality|conditionals]]) are formed using them, and those statements taken together are the [[definition]] of the term.

Consider a sentence such as "There's an electron in the sink." This means something along the lines of: "There exist some properties ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ( one for every theoretical property involved in the scientific theory, with 'electronhood' (which roughly corresponds to the [[essence]] of an [[electron]] included as ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) such that... (a statement in the scientific theory, but with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; substituted for the specific terms such as 'charge', 'is an electron', etc. employed by the theory), and there is something in the sink that has ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;."

The process of converting the narrative form of a scientific theory into [[second-order logic]] is commonly called "Ramsification" (sometimes also spelled "Ramseyfication").

Example: Suppose there are only three principles in our scientific theory about electrons (those principles can be seen to be statements involving the properties):

A1. Electrons (things that have P1) have charge (P2).

A2. Things with charge (P2) tickle you.

A3. Electrons (things that have P1) cause lightning.

Furthermore, we include the property of "electronhood", as outlined above, to be designated by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the property of "charge" to be designated by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Then the meaning of a sentence such as "I have an electron in my pocket" is Ramsified into:

"There are properties ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that (things with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; also have ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and things with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tickle you, and things with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cause lightning, and there is a thing with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in my pocket)."

}}'''Sanshin Zen Community''' is a [[Soto Zen]] [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] based at the temple '''Sanshin-ji''' in [[Bloomington, Indiana]] founded by [[Shohaku Okumura]].&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to Sanshin Zen Community|url=http://sanshinji.org/home/|publisher=Sanshin Zen Community|accessdate=April 24, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520202311/http://sanshinji.org/home/|archivedate=May 20, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Sanshin Zen Community was incorporated as an organization in 1996 by [[Shohaku Okumura]] after serving as the interim abbot of the [[Minnesota Zen Meditation Center]] since 1992. He chose the name {{nihongo|sanshin|‰∏âÂøÉ|sanshin}}, meaning "three minds", in reference to [[Eihei Dogen]]'s teaching from the ''[[Tenzo Ky≈çkun]]'' of the three minds a Zen student should cultivate: magnanimous mind, parental mind, and joyful mind. However, the following year the S≈çt≈ç-shumucho, the administrative body of [[S≈çt≈ç]] Zen in Japan, asked Okumura to head the Soto Zen Education Center in San Francisco, to which he agreed, delaying his plans to found his own temple. While still serving in that position, his friend and Buddhist Studies scholar John McRae, recommended locating his temple in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. By 2002 land had been purchased and a local architect employed to design a combined zendo and living space for the Okumura family.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Haederle|first=Michael|title=Profile: Sanshin Zen Community|newspaper=[[Lion's Roar (magazine)|Lion's Roar]]|year=2013|date=12 November 2013|url=https://www.lionsroar.com/profile-sanshin-zen-community/|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] follows a modified monastic schedule&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Schedule|url=http://sanshinji.org/schedule/|publisher=Sanshin Zen Community|accessdate=April 24, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308025138/http://sanshinji.org/schedule/|archivedate=March 8, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a retreat each month.&lt;ref name="home"/&gt;  Sanshin is one of the few Zen communities offering a sesshin ('without toys') in the style of Uchiyama-roshi, featuring 14 hours of zazen per day with no ceremonies, work, or Dharma talks. Okumura also offers regular Genzo-e retreats devoted to studying one of the fascicles of [[D≈çgen|D≈çgen Zenji's]] [[Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç]];&lt;ref name="home"/&gt; he also travels to give them at other prominent North American Zen Centers.&lt;ref name="home"/&gt; Since the founding of Sanshin-ji, Okumura has ordained multiple students as priests, some of whom have gone on to found their own temples and monasteries elsewhere. For example, Okumura's student Densho Quintero had founded the Comunidad Soto Zen de Colombia in [[Bogot√°]] in 1989, while [[Sh≈çry≈´ Bradley]] founded the [[Gyobutsuji Zen Monastery]] in Arkansas in 2011. In early 2016 it was announced that the founding abbot Shohaku Okumura would retire in 2023 to be gradually succeeded by his student [[Hoko Karnegis]], who would serve as vice abbot in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sperry|first=Rod Meade|title=Hoko Karnegis to succeed Sanshin Zen Community abbot Shohaku Okumura|newspaper=[[Lion's Roar (magazine)|Lion's Roar]]|year=2016|date=6 January 2016|url=https://www.lionsroar.com/hoko-karnegis-to-succeed-sanshin-zen-community-abbot-shohaku-okumura/|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horn 1989; Levinson 2000): "Has Anne ever eaten squid? No, she has never eaten that."|accessdate=2008-10-24|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-151440204.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[implicature]] that attributes an ''implicit'' meaning beyond the explicit or ''literal'' meaning of an [[utterance]], and which suggests that the utterer had a reason for not using a more informative or ''stronger'' term on the same scale.  The choice of the weaker characterization suggests that, as far as the speaker knows, none of the stronger characterizations in the scale holds. This is commonly seen in the use of 'some' to suggest the meaning 'not all', even though 'some' is logically consistent with 'all'.&lt;ref&gt;Noveck p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;   If Bill says 'I have some of my money in cash', this utterance suggests to a hearer (though the sentence uttered does not [[Logical consequence|logically imply]] it) that Bill does not have all his money in cash.

==Origin==
Scalar implicatures typically arise where the speaker qualifies or scales their statement with language that conveys to the listener an inference or implicature that indicates that the speaker had reasons not to use a stronger, more informative, term.&lt;ref name="Musolino"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Musolino|first=Julien|author2=Jeffrey Lidz |date=July 1, 2006|journal=[[Linguistics: An Interdisciplinary Journal of the Language Sciences]]|title=Why children aren't universally successful with quantification|volume=44|issue=4|pages=818|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|accessdate=2008-10-24|quote=Here we investigate experimentally the development of the semantics-pragmatics interface, focusing on Greek-speaking five-year-olds' interpretation of aspectual expressions such as arxizo ('start') and degree modifiers such as miso ('half') and mexri ti mesi ('halfway')." "Such expressions are known to give rise to scalar inferences cross-linguistically: for instance, start, even though compatible with expressions denoting completion (e.g. finish), is typically taken to implicate non-completion. Overall, our experiments reveal that children have limited success in deriving scalar implicatures from the use of aspectual verbs but they succeed with 'discrete' degree modifiers such as 'half'.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-151440204.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, where a speaker uses the term "some" in the statement, "Some students can afford a new car.", the use of "some" gives rise to an inference or implicature that "Not all students can afford a new car."&lt;ref name="Musolino"/&gt;

As with pragmatic inference generally, such inferences are [[defeasibility|defeasible]] or cancellable - the inferred meaning may not be true, even though the literal meaning is true.  This distinguishes such inferences from [[entailment]].  They are also non-detachable.  A conversational implicature is said to be ''non-detachable'' when, after the replacement of what is said with another expression with the same literal meaning, the same conversational implicature remains.&lt;ref&gt;Korta p.4&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguishes them from conventional implicatures.

In a 2006 experiment with Greek-speaking five-year-olds' interpretation of aspectual expressions, the results revealed that children have limited success in deriving scalar implicatures from the use of [[aspectual verb]]s such as "start" (which implicates non-completion).&lt;ref name="insights"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staff|date=December 25, 2006|journal=Health &amp; Medicine Week|title=Research reports from University of Delaware, Department of Psychology provide new insights into child language in children|volume=|issue=|chapter=|pages=195|publisher=NewsRX|issn=1531-6459|quote=|url=|edition=Expanded Reporting}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tested children succeed in deriving scalar implicatures with discrete degree modifiers such as "half" as in half finished.&lt;ref name="insights"/&gt; Their ability to spontaneously compute scalar implicatures was greater than their ability to judge the pragmatic appropriateness of scalar statements.&lt;ref name="insights"/&gt; In addition, the tested children were able to suspend scalar implicatures in environments where they were not supported.&lt;ref name="insights"/&gt; 

[[Paul Grice|Griceans]] attempt to explain these implicatures in terms of the [[Maxim of Quantity|maxim of quantity]], according to which one is to be just as informative as required. The idea is that if the speaker were in a position to make the stronger statement, they would have. Since (s)he did not, (s)he must believe that the stronger statement is not true.

== Examples of scalar implicature ==

Some examples of scalar implicature&lt;ref&gt;taken from Carston&lt;/ref&gt; are:

:1a. Bill has got some of Chomsky's papers.
:1b. The speaker believes that Bill hasn't got all of Chomsky's papers.

:2a. There will be five of us for dinner tonight.
:2b. There won't be more than five of us for dinner tonight.

:3a. She won't necessarily get the job.
:3b. She will possibly get the job.

Uttering the sentence (a) in most cases will communicate the assumption in (b).  This seems to be because the speaker did not use stronger terms such as 'there will be ''more'' than five people for dinner tonight' or 'she ''can't possibly'' get the job'.  For example, if Bill really did have all of Chomsky's papers, the speaker would have said so.  However, according to the maxim of quantity, a speaker will only be informative as is required, and will therefore not use any stronger terms unless required.  The hearer, knowing this, will assume that the stronger term does not apply.

{{17th Century Scholasticism}}
'''Second scholasticism''' (or '''late scholasticism''')&lt;ref&gt;Manlio Bellomo, The Common Legal Past of Europe, 1000‚Äì1800, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; is the period of revival of [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] system of [[philosophy]] and [[theology]], in the 16th and 17th centuries. The scientific culture of second scholasticism surpassed its medieval source ([[Scholasticism]]) in the number of its proponents, the breadth of its scope, the analytical complexity, sense of historical and literary criticism, and the volume of editorial production, most of which remains hitherto little explored.

==Scotism and Thomism==
Unlike the "First", i.e. medieval scholasticism, a typical feature of second scholasticism was the development of schools of thought, developing the intellectual heritage of their "teacher". Two schools survived from earlier phases of scholasticism, [[Scotism]] and [[Thomism]]. The Scotists, mostly belonging to the various branches of the Franciscan order, include the Italians [[Antonius Trombetta]], [[Bartolomeo Mastri]], [[Bonaventura Belluto]]; the Frenchman [[Claude Frassen]], the Irish emigrants [[Luke Wadding]], [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]], and [[Hugh Caughwell]]; and the Germans [[Bernhard Sannig]] and [[Crescentius Krisper]]. The Thomists were usually but not exclusively represented by the [[Iberia]]ns in the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and the [[Carmelite]] orders. They include [[Thomas Cajetan]] ( or Caietanus), [[Domingo de Soto]], [[Domingo B√°√±ez]], [[Franciscus Ferrariensis]], the [[Complutenses]], [[Jo√£o Poinsot]] and others.

==Jesuit scholasticism==
The intellectual influence of second scholasticism was augmented by the establishment of the [[Society of Jesus]] (1540), by [[Ignatius Loyola]], per approval of [[Pope Paul III]]. The "Jesuits" are considered a third "school" of second scholasticism, although this refers more to the common style of academic work rather than to some common doctrine. The important figures include [[Pedro da Fonseca (philosopher)|Pedro da Fonseca]], Antonio Rubio, the [[Conimbricenses]], [[Robert Bellarmine]], [[Francisco Su√°rez]], [[Luis de Molina]], [[Gabriel V√°squez]], [[Pedro Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Rodrigo Arriaga]], and many others.

There were also many "independent" thinkers like [[Sebastian Izquierdo]], [[Caramuel|Juan Caramuel y Lobkowicz]], [[Kenelm Digby]], [[Raffael Aversa]] etc.

==Decline and legacy==
The golden age of Second Scholasticism was the first decades of the 17th century, at which time it was still largely in control of university curricula in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ariew and D. Gabbay, "The scholastic background", in ''Cambridge History of Seventeenth Century Philosophy'', ed. D. Garber and M. Ayers (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998), ch. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; But second scholasticism started to decline under the attacks of philosophers writing in vernacular languages, such as [[Descartes]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[John Locke|Locke]], and from the competition from more experimental and mathematical ways of doing science promoted by the [[Scientific Revolution]]. It was largely dormant from the onset of Enlightenment in the end of the 17th century, although scholastics such as Suarez remained influential for a long period. In some Iberian universities the scholastic culture remained vivid well into the 19th century, providing background for the birth of [[Neo-Scholasticism]].

Interest in the thought of the late scholastics has been recently revived by the journal [[Studia Neoaristotelica]].

==Life==
Little is known about the life of Theon of Smyrna. A bust created at his death, and dedicated by his son, was discovered at [[Smyrna]], and art historians date it to around 135 CE. [[Ptolemy]] refers several times in his ''[[Almagest]]'' to a Theon who made observations at [[Alexandria]], but it is uncertain whether he is referring to Theon of Smyrna.&lt;ref name="evans49"&gt;James Evans, (1998), ''The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy'', page 49&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moon|lunar]] [[impact crater]] [[Theon Senior (crater)|Theon Senior]] is named for him.

==Works==
Theon wrote several commentaries on the works of mathematicians and philosophers of the time, including works on the philosophy of [[Plato]]. Most of these works are lost. The one major survivor is his ''On Mathematics Useful for the Understanding of Plato''. A second work concerning the order in which to study Plato's works has recently been discovered in an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation.&lt;ref&gt;"Theon of Smyrna" entry in John Hazel, 2002, ''Who's who in the Greek world'', page 37. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

===''On Mathematics Useful for the Understanding of Plato''===
His ''On Mathematics Useful for the Understanding of Plato'' is not a commentary on Plato's writings but rather a general handbook for a student of mathematics. It is not so much a groundbreaking work as a reference work of ideas already known at the time. Its status as a compilation of already-established knowledge and its thorough citation of earlier sources is part of what makes it valuable.

The first part of this work is divided into two parts, the first covering the subjects of numbers and the second dealing with music and [[harmony]]. The first section, on mathematics, is most focused on what today is most commonly known as [[number theory]]: [[odd number]]s, [[even number]]s, [[prime number]]s, [[perfect number]]s, [[abundant number]]s, and other such properties. It contains an account of 'side and diameter numbers', the Pythagorean method for a sequence of best rational approximations to the [[square root of 2]],&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h4JsAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA91 T. Heath "A History of Greek Mathematics", p.91].&lt;/ref&gt; the denominators of which are [[Pell number]]s.  It is also one of the sources of our knowledge of the origins of the classical problem of [[Doubling the cube]].&lt;ref name="Zhmud"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oX28qf7LKdoC&amp;pg=PA84 L. Zhmud ''The origin of the history of science in classical antiquity'', p.84].&lt;/ref&gt;

The second section, on music, is split into three parts: music of numbers (''hƒì en arithmois mousikƒì''), instrumental music (''hƒì en organois mousikƒì''), and "[[Musica universalis|music of the spheres]]" (''hƒì en kosm≈ç harmonia kai hƒì en tout≈ç harmonia''). The "music of numbers" is a treatment of temperament and harmony using [[ratio]]s, proportions, and means; the sections on instrumental music concerns itself not with melody but rather with [[interval (music)|interval]]s and [[consonance and dissonance|consonance]]s in the manner of Pythagoras' work. Theon considers intervals by their degree of consonance: that is, by how simple their ratios are. (For example, the [[octave]] is first, with the simple 2:1 ratio of the octave to the fundamental.) He also considers them by their distance from one another.

The third section, on the music of the cosmos, he considered most important, and ordered it so as to come after the necessary background given in the earlier parts. Theon quotes a poem by [[Alexander of Ephesus]] assigning specific pitches in the chromatic scale to each planet, an idea that would retain its popularity for a millennium thereafter.

The second book is on [[astronomy]]. Here Theon affirms the spherical shape and large size of the Earth; he also describes the [[occultation]]s, [[Astronomical transit|transits]], [[Astronomical conjunction|conjunctions]], and [[eclipse]]s. However, the quality of the work led [[Otto Neugebauer]] to criticize him for not fully understanding the material he attempted to present.

'''Valentin Alberti''' (1635‚Äì1697) was a Lutheran, orthodox philosopher and theologian from [[Silesia]] and was the son of a preacher.

He is known for defending Lutheran orthodoxy against the natural law views of [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] and [[Christian Thomasius]], and being an active polemicist against Roman Catholicism.

He began his studies at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1656, obtaining the ''Magister'' degree in 1656. By 1663 he was already a professor of logic and metaphysics and in 1672 he became an associate professor of theology as well. Alberti was one of the principal representatives of Christian natural law ''Juris Naturae Orthodoxae Compendium Theologiae Conformatum'' and [[Samuel von Pufendorf]]'s main opponent.

In 1665, he married the daughter of the Leipzig city judge Johannis Preibisi.

Alberti supervised the thesis of [[Christian Stridtbeckh]] on the possibility of a pact with the devil, in 1690 and 1716 first in Latin, 1723 also appeared in German translation. He held the theological opinions maintaining the possibility of reincarnation of souls from purgatory.

'''Viktorin Kornel ze V≈°ehrd''' (of V≈°ehrdy) or simply V≈°ehrd (1460-1520), was a Czech [[humanist]] and [[lawyer]], working towards the end of the 15th century as Vice-scribe at the Land Court in the [[Prague Castle]]. He is famous for the most penetrating analysis of the Czech common law that he has put forward on some 460 pages under the title ‚ÄúOn the Laws of the Czech Land Nine Books‚Äù (‚ÄûO pr√°v√≠ch zemƒõ ƒçesk√© knihy devatery‚Äú). He has also translated some Latin texts.

==Life==

Viktorin Kornelius was born in the burgher [[Utraquist]] (moderate reformed Hussite Church)&lt;ref&gt;The Czech Kingdom was the first Western European land where a national reformation movement had succeeded, some 110 years before Martin Luther. From that time on, for nearly 200 years, up to 1620 and following brutally enforced recatholisation by the Hapsburgs and Jesuits, the majority of the Czech population on the territory of the present-day Czech Republic belonged to national reformed churches or sects. The largest one of them was the ‚ÄûUtraquist Church‚Äú covering an overwhelming majority of the Czech people, including especially peasants and common burghers. Less than 5% of the population belonged to the Unity of Brethren, some of whose descendants are now in the Moravian Church / Iglesia Morava, a great deal of German inhabitants in the Czech lands were Lutherans. Only some 15% were Catholics and maybe some 2% of the people there were Jewish. See David (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; environment of the East-Bohemian town of [[Chrudim]] in 1460. Having graduated from the Faculty of Arts of the then Utraquist [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], V≈°ehrd gained a wider outlook and capacities of generalization - preconditions for asking, reflecting on as well as answering a number of questions the previous authors of law books from the ranks of nobility had not arrived at.&lt;ref&gt;Klabouch (1961), pp. 201-202; the previous authors of law books from the ranks of nobility: e.g. Ond≈ôej z Dub√© or Ctibor Tovaƒçovsk√Ω z Cimburka&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1487 V≈°ehrd held the Office of the Land Boards on the [[Prague Castle]] and from 1493 to 1497, during the vacant post of the slibe, he held the post of Vice-scribe at the Land Court in the [[Prague Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Vesel√Ω (1961), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The Land Boards with rulings of the Land Court, which were to be burnt during the later great fire of [[Prague Castle]] in 1541, had decayed into a flimsy and bad state even before V≈°ehrd's activities. Lawyers in the land routinely used the mere digests of rulings in the form of subject- or alphabetically ordered registers.&lt;ref&gt;Vesel√Ω (1961), pp. 141-142&lt;/ref&gt; These attitudes and V≈°ehrd's recording of legal documents led to his dismissal from the Land Court in 1497. Nevertheless, in the course of his appointment he had managed to collect enough material to write his scholarly treatise. Having finished the treatise in 1501,&lt;ref&gt;Pr√°vnƒõhistorick√© stude (1961): ƒå√°da, pp. 114-117, Urfus, p. 261, Vesel√Ω , pp. 145-146&lt;/ref&gt; he offered it to the public to be copied freely.&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874), Zav≈ôenie, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; He explicitly granted the results of his work for the defense of good and just people ‚Äúso that they would be able to protect themselves against evil and wilful people.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd, (1874) II, 17, 13, pp. 64-65; Ibidem, Zav≈ôenie, p. 459&lt;/ref&gt; Having lost his position, V≈°ehrd successfully carried on his legal and financial practice.&lt;ref&gt;Urfus (1961), p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] on 21 September 1520 and is buried in historical [[Lesser Town of Prague]], in the Romanesque-Gothic, church of John the Baptist (now Czechoslovak Hussite ‚Äú[[:cs:Kostel svat√©ho Jana K≈ôtitele Na pr√°dle|Kostel svat√©ho Jana K≈ôtitele Na pr√°dle]]‚Äù, [[Mal√° Strana]].)

===Assets of Czech Common Law===
If, today, legal systems of European origin are usually divided into civil law originated in the framework of late Roman positive law with codified written principles and the [[English common law]], giving precedential authority to prior court decisions,&lt;ref&gt;Lobban (2007), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; the latter practices were in older times not quite exclusive for England. Such systems dominated in the historic lands of the [[Czech Kingdom]] as late as the beginnings of the Modern Age,&lt;ref&gt;Klabouch (1961), p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; and even longer in the then Polish and Hungarian lands. Czech common law was abolished by Hapsburg emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] only after the loss of national sovereignty in 1627 ‚Äì some years after the fateful defeat in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (1620).&lt;ref&gt;Schelle (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In a spirit similar to some English lawyers V≈°ehrd extolled irretrievability of legal customs in which the experiences of past ages had been condensed, as V≈°ehrd put it, ‚Äúfrom ancestors and old Czechs arduously and dilligently found.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874), Zav≈ôenie, pp. 458-459; Ibidem, IX, 10, 14, p. 453; Ibidem IX, 10, 17 (petit); Lobban (2007), p. 33 [quoting Robert Coke]; Blackstone (1916), p. 5, 52, 70&lt;/ref&gt; V≈°ehrd realized that the stability and force of customs and traditions in this way served as a guarantee of liberty and a mighty barrier against intentional misuse of the law by the powerful. He warned against the most ‚Äúbaneful‚Äù enemies ‚Äì those who would abuse the laws, who would like to change, modify and turn over the very laws ‚Äúby which the land has been standing from the time immemorial.‚Äù The changes would mean ‚Äúdownfall of the good and in particular poor people, widows and orphans.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874) IX, 10, 17, pp. 437-438&lt;/ref&gt; ‚ÄúIf the laws of the land work in their steadiness and unvariability, the goings on for all people in general as well as for any person in particular are good. If the laws of the land change, the goings on are on the contrary bad for all as for any single individual.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874) VIII, 26, 1, p. 383; Ibidem, III, 18, pp. 140-141; Klabouch (1961), p. 217, 222&lt;/ref&gt; 
Through his comparison of the Czech Land Boards with the Roman [[Twelve Tables]] the open-minded and freedom-loving as well as conservative V≈°ehrd implied that Czech law is of no lower value than [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874) V, 43, 4, p. 252; Urfus, pp. 262-263&lt;/ref&gt; His moderate legal relativism does not exclude possibility of a partial inspiration from abroad. To adopt principles from foreign legal systems is admittedly possible, but usually not suitable: what works well in one legal system often does not prove its worth in another. It is more rewarding simply to learn from foreign experiences and their comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Klabouch (1961), p. 211, 213-215&lt;/ref&gt; The canon law of the [[Catholic Church]] had after the [[Hussite Wars]] almost disappeared from awareness of the Czech people,&lt;ref&gt;Boh√°ƒçek (1961), pp. 152-154; V≈°ehrd (1874), V, 45, 7, p. 253; Ibidem, I, 4, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; but some elements of the [[Roman law]] had found a way into native practice.&lt;ref&gt;Boh√°ƒçek (1961), pp. 147-199&lt;/ref&gt; V≈°ehrd complained that the lawyers who had been educated at foreign universities were trying to practice at the Land Court the rules that had not been accepted by the native law.&lt;ref&gt;Boh√°ƒçek (1961), p. 147, 149; V≈°ehrd (1874), P≈ôedmluva, p. 6-8; Ibidem  II, 19, 12, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he was not satisfied with protracted and therefore costly lawsuits held according to the [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874), P≈ôedmluva, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vice-Scribe as an Impartial Observer===
V≈°ehrd tried to set himself free from his own interests, to defend general interests and to adopt the outlook of an impartial observer. From this perspective he could make an opinion on the damages the short-term and selfish aims of certain individuals or social classes had brought about to the whole society. On the other hand, if it seemed obvious to him, V≈°ehrd reminded individuals or groups that they were harming their own interests and themselves in a long-time span.&lt;ref&gt;Klabouch (1961), p. 230; V≈°ehrd (1874), II, 17, 13, pp. 64-65; Ibidem, Zav≈ôen√≠, pp. 455-456&lt;/ref&gt; He called on those who were advancing unjustifiably to make agreement and reconciliation with their adversary. An incessant effort is needed to keep the justice. ‚ÄúThe useful does not differ from the fair, but ‚Äúone is indissolubly tied up with the other‚Äù and ‚Äúall the evils begin with, yield, grow and carry out from their separation.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874), VIII, 32, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; And V≈°ehrd opposed the dictate of high nobility and its functional codification of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Klabouch (1961), p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; 
While the first three books of the work ‚ÄúOn the Laws of the Czech Land Nine Books‚Äù deal roughly with what is nowadays called [[procedural law]], the next three discuss substantive law to which a short supplement on execution is added. In the seventh book we find further and more detailed regulations on execution law. The eighth book deals with some publicly relevant legal documents and with administrative fees. Finally, the ninth book deals with confusions and inconsistencies in the application of law as well as with some reforms of legal order.&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874), VIII, 1, p. 351; Vesel√Ω (1961), p. 144; Urfus (1961), p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;

===Columns of Power and Contract===
With patent satisfaction, V≈°ehrd understood the relationship between king and society in the Czech state as a social contract. The land itself elects the king, it is not purchased by him by any money and is subject to him only voluntarily: The king must make an oath to the land and is obliged to administer it ‚Äúnot as he would like to, but only along the age-old liberties and rights of the land.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874), III, 22, 15, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The civil servants should remember ‚Äúthat they are not masters, but only servants of all community and all the people; for they take from the people their money and fees for their profession which is, as they often hear, their plough.‚Äù Even the Land Boards, let alone each office in general, is construed as service for the sake of all. Therefore, it is desirable that all ‚Äúwhose profession makes them to come to the Boards should be serving all people without shouting and discords about their needs, talking meekly as servants, not shouting as lords.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874), IV, 2, 15-16, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[John Locke]] tried to limit the executive power by the power legislative (and federative),&lt;ref&gt;Locke (1980), XI-XIV, pp. 69-87&lt;/ref&gt; V≈°ehrd in his effort to maintain the balance of power did not count with any legislative assembly that would have legislative powers. The legal order of the land, in his understanding, had so far been and also should have been formed primarily and just by old customs and precedents. Only in special cases ‚Äì as was the case of the then notorious [[:cs:Dalibor z Kozojed|Dalibor of Kozojedy]] who in 1496 had taken over the serfs and property of another squire ‚Äì the judgment depended upon discretionary powers of judges. In addition to the king, equipped with some executive powers, the second V≈°ehrd's column of power is so formed by the whole of old traditions, ‚Äúliberties and rights‚Äù of the land itself. I.e. by assemblies (the Assembly or the Diet (Snƒõmovna) of the Land had until the 1620s the explicit power to choose and/or elect the king, to give consent to taxation and recruitment quotas), the above-mentioned legal order given primarily by the old customs and precedents, which should be transparent and familiar to the wider public, and finally by people's customs and habits in a wider sense.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Fawn, Ji≈ô√≠ Hochman (2010), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; 
The contract between the land and the sovereign is in V≈°ehrd obviously more equal than later in [[Thomas Hobbes]]‚Äô [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]; position of the land is stronger and the sovereign is weaker. V≈°ehrd‚Äôs sovereign is even not able, due to a lack of political power, to appoint his successors.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes (1996) 2000, I, 14; II, 18-21, 30&lt;/ref&gt; V≈°ehrd also appreciates peace, preferring negotiations to war,&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874), P≈ôedmluva, p. 6; Polin (1993), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; but unlike Hobbes, he almost does not use religious arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Klabouch (1961), p. 216; Hobbes (1996) 2000, II&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Czech lands had by then already established religious toleration; in principle every single individual could choose their own religion by then. Even political groupings or proto-parties in the estates assemblies (after the 1485 [[Religious peace of Kutn√° Hora|Peace of Kutn√° Hora]])  used to be formed by different religious groups (and individual people could choose their confession in the Lands of the Czech Crown then).&lt;ref&gt;Hora (1998); ƒåornej (2001), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

===Familiarity with Legal Customs===
V≈°ehrd tried to make especially lower and middle classes familiar with the law in order not to be neglected in their proceedings and needs. As many people as possible were to have a look into the law and operations of judiciary. V≈°ehrd stressed equal inheritance rights for women, arguing by age-old foundation of native law.&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874), V, 37, 6 p. 245; Ibidem, P≈ôedmluva, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; And in addition to that, he maintained, it is useful and entertaining to consider the laws of the land as it ‚Äúis sharpening reason and hardening memory of those who often think about them.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874), VII, 30, 20, p. 339; Ibidem, Zav≈ôenie, p. 459&lt;/ref&gt; That is why V≈°ehrd approved of the substitution of Latin by the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù Czech language at the Land Boards and elsewhere in the land's judiciary in 1495.&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874), IV, 2, 14, p. 162; Ibidem, IX, 10, 13, p. 453; Ibidem, IX, 10, 17, p. 437-438 (petit)&lt;/ref&gt; And he refused the steps common in that period towards making law more opaque and its application more difficult (e.g. the use of paper instead of the previous use of more durable parchment for recordings of judicial rulings; new crossings that made the previous text illegible; the hindering of free access to the Land Boards that had been accessible before to every single individual; or entries into the Land Boards without the respective parties being present, or even notified).&lt;ref&gt;Klabouch (1961), pp. 219-221; V≈°ehrd (1874), IX, 10, pp. 428-453; Ibidem, VIII, 5, 2, p. 353; Ibidem, V, 32, pp. 235-239&lt;/ref&gt; So with his own overheads, V≈°ehrd was in his leisure time and to his own disadvangage, helping people by enabling them to take care of themselves.

==Influence==
Thanks to the Hussite reform movement [[Czech language]] was introduced to the official and legal agenda (and the Czech example strengthened the position of some other national languages in surrounding countries, especially Hungarian and rather indirectly also Romanian).&lt;ref&gt;Kej≈ô (1984), p. 144; Goll (1916), p. 196, 236; Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy 2, Heading: Czech Republic, Philosophy in, Josef Zumr (p. 763-769), p. 765:
In Bohemia as elsewhere, the Reformation was followed by a surge in Renaissance humanism, both existing simultaneously and having mutual influence. In fact, representatives of both sides aimed to bring the two movements together. Viktorin Kornel of V≈°ehrdy (d. circa 1520), a founder of the first Czech law school, worked on the philosophy of natural law, which reflected the self-awareness of the new class of citizens. He was also the creator of a philosophy of Czech history that overemphasized the importance of the Hussite period.
&lt;/ref&gt;  V≈°ehrd turned to his native language and was among initiators of the tradition of Czech national and reformational [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874), IX, 17, pp. 437-438; ƒåapek (1961), pp. 65-76; P≈ôedmluva k p≈ôekladu Knih o napraven√≠ padl√©ho od Jana Zlato√∫st√©ho (tisk z r. 1501) [http://ftp.mgo.opava.cz/kry/jazyk_cesky/citanka/020-viktorin-kornel-ze-vsehrd-blahoslav-filipika-bible-kralicka.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he parted company with his friend, the noble and Catholic poet [[Bohuslav Hasi≈°tejnsk√Ω z Lobkovic]] (of Lobkovice), who wrote in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;ƒåapek (1961), p. 61-69&lt;/ref&gt;

V≈°ehrd's work has survived [[Baroque|Baroque period]] called by many a ¬¥period of darkness¬¥ (that at least in political and intellectual sense in the Czech lands) in handwritten copies. During the period of the [[Czech National Revival|National Revival]] in the 19th century the work served a role in the process of re-creation of the Czech legal terminology. The first book edition in 1841 was considerably curtailed by the Austrian Metternichian censorship, that was not satisfied even with those compromises V≈°ehrd had had to make some 340 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;V≈°ehrd (1874), xiii-xiv; Vanƒõƒçek (1961), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The second and the till-date last edition, that was published in 1874, is nowadays almost out of reach.

V≈°ehrd's name was in 1868 taken over by Czech law students. Their organization, ‚Äú[http://www.vsehrd.cz/en/vsehrd/about-us/ V≈°ehrd Association of Czech Lawyers]‚Äù, renewed after ‚Äú1989 [[Velvet Revolution]]‚Äú in [[Czechoslovakia]], has been working up to now.

'''Wani''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: {{nihongo|Wani, Wani Kishi|Áéã‰ªÅ, ÂíåÈÇáÂêâÂ∏´}}) is a semi-legendary scholar who is said to have been sent to [[Japan]] by [[Baekje]] of southwestern [[Korea]] during the reign of [[Emperor ≈åjin]]. He used to be associated with the introduction of the Chinese writing system to Japan.

==Original sources and analysis==
Wani is mentioned only in Japanese history books; he is not recorded in Chinese or Korean sources.&lt;ref&gt;Early Korean books referring to Wani were written more than a millennium later and were clearly based on Japanese sources, not on their own. See (Kim:2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The main sources of Wani's biography are the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720) and the ''[[Kojiki]]'' (712).

{{Quotation|In the 15th year [of the [[Emperor ≈åjin|Emperor ≈åjin's]] reign](404 A.D.), in autumn, in August, new moon of [[Sexagenary cycle|r√©n-x≈´, dƒ´ng-m«éo]] (the sixth), the King of Baekje dispatched Achiki and offered up two good horses as a tribute [to Japan, along with him]. Then, they were reared in the stable (''umaya'') atop the hill (''saka'') of Karu. And, Achiki was entrusted to raise them. Therefore, the place where the horses were raised was called Umayasaka. Achiki also read the Confucian classics well. Then, Prince Uji-no-Waki-Iratsuko took him as his teacher. Now, the Emperor inquired to Achiki, saying, "Is there any scholar superior to you?" He replied, "There is a man called Wani. He is excellent." Then, the Emperor dispatched Aratawake and Kamunagiwake (a male oracle), who were ancestors of the Kamitsuke-no-Kimi clan, to Baekje, to summon Wani. This Achiki is the progenitor of the Achiki-no-Fubito clan.

In the 16th year, in spring, in February, Wani had come. Then, Prince Uji-no-Waki-Iratsuko took him as his teacher, learned various classics under him and there was nothing he didn't become thoroughly acquainted with. This so-called Wani was the progenitor of the Fumi-no-Obito clan.|''Nihon Shoki'',„ÄÄVol. 10&lt;ref&gt;Original text: ÂçÅ‰∫îÂπ¥ÁßãÂÖ´ÊúàÂ£¨ÊàåÊúî‰∏ÅÂçØÔºåÁôæÊøüÁéãÈÅ£ÈòøÁõ¥Â≤êÔºåË≤¢ËâØÈ¶¨‰∫åÂåπ„ÄÇÂç≥È§äÊñºËºïÈò™‰∏äÂªÑ„ÄÅÂõ†‰ª•ÈòøÁõ¥Â≤ê‰ª§ÊéåÈ£º„ÄÇÊïÖËôüÂÖ∂È§äÈ¶¨‰πãËôïÊõ∞ÂªÑÈò™‰πü„ÄÇÈòøÁõ¥Â≤ê‰∫¶ËÉΩËÆÄÁ∂ìÂÖ∏„ÄÇÂèäÂ§™Â≠êËèüÈÅìÁ®öÈÉéÂ≠êÂ∏´ÁÑâ„ÄÇÊñºÊòØÂ§©ÁöáÂïèÈòøÁõ¥Â≤êÊõ∞ÔºåÂ¶ÇÂãùÊ±ùÂçöÂ£´‰∫¶ÊúâËÄ∂„ÄÇÂ∞çÊõ∞ÔºåÊúâÁéã‰ªÅËÄÖ„ÄÇÊòØÁßÄ‰πü„ÄÇÊôÇÈÅ£‰∏äÊØõÈáéÂêõÁ•ñËçíÁî∞Âà•„ÉªÂ∑´Âà•ÊñºÁôæÊøüÔºå‰ªçÂæµÁéã‰ªÅ‰πü„ÄÇÂÖ∂ÈòøÁõ¥Â≤êËÄÖÈòøÁõ¥Â≤êÂè≤‰πãÂßãÁ•ñ‰πü„ÄÇÂçÅÂÖ≠Âπ¥Êò•‰∫åÊúà„ÄÅÁéã‰ªÅ‰æÜ‰πã„ÄÇÂâáÂ§™Â≠êËèüÈÅìÁ®öÈÉéÂ≠êÂ∏´‰πãÔºåÁøíË´∏ÂÖ∏Á±çÊñºÁéã‰ªÅËé´‰∏çÈÄöÈÅî„ÄÇÊâÄË¨ÇÁéã‰ªÅËÄÖÔºåÊòØÊõ∏È¶ñÁ≠âÂßãÁ•ñ‰πü„ÄÇ&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quotation|And, [the Emperor ≈åjin] ordered [Geunchogo, the King of] Baekje, "If there is any wise man, offer him up as tribute."  The person whose name, offered by the command, was Wani-Kishi. And, [the King] gave, as tributes, along with him, ten volumes of ''the [[Analects]]'' and one volume of the ''[[Thousand Character Classic]]''. This Wani-Kishi is the progenitor of the Fumi-no-Obito clan.|''Kojiki'',„ÄÄmiddle volume&lt;ref&gt;Original text: ÂèàÔºåÁßëË≥úÁôæÊøüÂúãÔºåËã•ÊúâË≥¢‰∫∫ËÄÖÔºåË≤¢‰∏ä„ÄÇÊïÖÂèóÂëΩ‰ª•Ë≤¢‰∏ä‰∫∫ÂêçÔºåÂíåÈÇáÂêâÂ∏´„ÄÇÂç≥Ë´ñË™ûÂçÅÂç∑„ÉªÂçÉÂ≠óÊñá‰∏ÄÂç∑ÔºåÂπ∂ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂç∑Ôºå‰ªòÊòØ‰∫∫Âç≥Ë≤¢ÈÄ≤„ÄÇÊ≠§ÂíåÈÇáÂêâÂ∏´ËÄÖÔºåÊñáÈ¶ñÁ≠âÁ•ñ„ÄÇ&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These stories have long been questioned by scholars. Ten volumes are too much for the ''Analects'', and more importantly, his alleged arrival predates the composition of the ''Thousand Character Classic'' (the early 6th century). [[Arai Hakuseki]] (1657‚Äì1725) considered that Wani had brought a certain book of Elementary Learning which the ''Kojiki'' had confused with the ''Thousand Character Classic''. [[Motoori Norinaga]] (1730‚Äì1801) claimed that it was pointless to care about details because the ''Thousand Character Classic'' was mentioned just as a typical book of Elementary Learning. Some assume a different version of the ''Thousand Character Classic'' was brought but this theory has no clear basis. In short, it is not unnatural for people like Wani to have come to Japan around that time, but there is no strong evidence determining whether Wani really existed.&lt;ref name="Seki:1996"&gt;Seki Akira Èñ¢ÊôÉ: ''Kodai no kikajin'' Âè§‰ª£„ÅÆÂ∏∞Âåñ‰∫∫, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating the alleged arrival of Wani is rather difficult since there are long-lasting disputes over the accuracy of these sources on early events. According to the traditional dating, it would be 285 though is considered too early by historians. Based on the reign of King Akue (ÈòøËä±Áéã; identified as King Asin ÈòøËéòÁéã) of Baekje, who, according to the ''Nihon Shoki'', died in the 16th year of Emperor ≈åjin's reign, it would be 405.&lt;ref name="Pan:2001"&gt;Pan Jixing ÊΩòÂêâÊòü: Áéã‰ªÅ‰∫ãËπüËàá‰∏ñÁ≥ªËÄÉ, ÂúãÂ≠∏Á†îÁ©∂, Vol. 8, pp.&amp;nbsp;5‚Äì31, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this theory contradicts the description of the ''[[Kojiki]]'', which says that Wani's arrival was during the reign of King Sh≈çko (ÁÖßÂè§Áéã; usually identified as King Geunchogo ËøëËÇñÂè§Áéã, r. 346-375) of Baekje. The ''Kojiki'' suggests that Wani arrived sometime after 372.&lt;ref name="Seki:1996" /&gt;

His name is not straightforward either. The ''Kojiki'' calls him "Wani Kishi".&lt;ref&gt;Kishi is considered to be a kind of honorary title used then in southern Korea.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Nihon Shoki'' and most of the subsequent documents read Áéã‰ªÅ. Although the reading ''Wani'' is irregular (the standard reading is ''≈å Jin'' or ''≈å Nin''), these characters look like a Chinese name (the surname Wang and the personal name Ren). This leads some scholars to consider that Wani was of Chinese descent. In fact his descendants claimed so. A supporting fact is that the Wang clan was powerful in China's former [[Lelang Commandery]] in northwestern Korea. After the downfall of the commandery around 313, some members of the Wang clan might have fled to Baekje, and then to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Inoue Mitsusada ‰∫ï‰∏äÂÖâË≤û: ''Wani no k≈çei shizoku to sono Bukky≈ç'' Áéã‰ªÅ„ÅÆÂæåË£îÊ∞èÊóè„Å®ÂÖ∂„ÅÆ‰ªèÊïô, Nihon kodai shis≈çshi no kenky≈´ Êó•Êú¨Âè§‰ª£ÊÄùÊÉ≥Âè≤„ÅÆÁ†îÁ©∂, pp. 412‚Äì467, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; A more skeptical view is that the legend of Wani was influenced by much later events: the surname Wang was selected as the most appropriate name for the ideal man of letters because in the late 6th century, several scholars surnamed Wang came to Japan from southern China via Baekje.&lt;ref name="Ukeda:1988"&gt;Ukeda Masayuki Ë´ãÁî∞Ê≠£Âπ∏: ''Fuhito sh≈´dan no ichi k≈çsatsu'' „Éï„Éí„ÉàÈõÜÂõ£„ÅÆ‰∏ÄËÄÉÂØü, Kodaishi ronsh≈´ (j≈ç) Âè§‰ª£Âè≤Ë´ñÈõÜ (‰∏ä), pp.&amp;nbsp;179‚Äì202, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descendants==
The descendants of Wani, or more precisely, those who claimed Wani to be their ancestor, were collectively called Kawachi no Fumi clan. They lived in Kisaichi of [[Kawachi Province]] together with their branch families. The head family had the ''uji'' "Fumi" [literature] after their duty as scribes, and similarly their branch families were given the ''kabane'' "Fuhito" [scribe].

Despite Wani's fame as a scholar, the Kawachi no Fumi clan was not so active as secretaries for administration. A rare exception was Fumi no Nemaro (ÊñáÁ¶∞È∫ªÂëÇ; ?-707). Instead of being active in civil administration, he rose to a rank unusually high for a mid-level bureaucrat for his performances in the [[Jinshin War]] (672). Some historians consider that this was the reason why the legend of Wani was recorded in the ''Kojiki'' and the ''Nihon Shoki''. It is known that scribes of foreign origin had similar and mutually conflicting legends about their founders. Features common in their stories include the arrival during the reign of Emperor ≈åjin, the introduction of Chinese literature and/or Confucianism, and the surname Wang. The legend of Wani was chosen with the rest of them ignored because the Kawachi no Fumi clan was relatively powerful at the time of the compilation of the history books.&lt;ref name="Ukeda:1988" /&gt;

In 791 Wani's descendants including Fumi no Mooto (ÊñáÊúÄÂºü) and Takefu no Makata (Ê≠¶ÁîüÁúüË±°) made a successful attempt to elevate their ''kabane'' or family rank. According to the ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'' (797), their appeal was as follows:
:Luan (È∏û) was a descendant of [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]]. Luan's descendant Wang Gou (ÁéãÁãó) moved to Baekje. During the reign of King Kuso of Baekje, the imperial court sent envoys to summon literati. King Kuso offered Gou's grandson Wang Ren (Wani) as a tribute. He was the founder of Fumi, Takefu and other clans.&lt;ref&gt;The article of the wuxu day, the 4th month, [[Enryaku]] 10 (791), from the ''Shoku Nihongi'': Êº¢È´òÂ∏ù‰πãÂæåÊõ∞È∏û, È∏û‰πãÂæåÁéãÁãóËª¢Ëá≥ÁôæÊ∏à. ÁôæÊ∏à‰πÖÁ¥†ÁéãÊôÇ, ËÅñÊúùÈÅ£‰ΩøÂæ¥Âè¨Êñá‰∫∫. ‰πÖÁ¥†ÁéãÂç≥‰ª•ÁãóÂ≠´Áéã‰ªÅË≤¢ÁÑâ. ÊòØÊñá, Ê≠¶ÁîüÁ≠â‰πãÁ•ñ‰πü.&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar story can be found in the description of the Fumi no Sukune (ÊñáÂÆøÁ¶∞) clan by the ''[[Shinsen Sh≈çjiroku]]'' (815).

==Later interpretations==
The article of the ''Nihon Shoki'' was traditionally interpreted as the introduction of Confucianism and/or Chinese literature although not clearly stated in the history book.

According to the preface to the ''[[Kokin Wakash≈´]]'' (905), a famous [[Waka (poetry)|Waka]] poem starting with "Naniwa-zu" was traditionally attributed to Wani.&lt;ref&gt;To be precise, this speculation was given as an old commentary to an obscure passage in the ''Kokin Wakash≈´''. Other interpretations are also possible, and the poem referred to as "Naniwa-zu" in the statement in question might be a different one. An important candidate is the first [[Waka (poetry)|tanka]] by Emperor Nintoku since it was created at the palace of Naniwa.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the imperial throne was vacant for three years because the future [[Emperor Nintoku]] (successor to Emperor ≈åjin) and his brother Crown Prince Uji no Waki Iratsuko renounced succession to the throne to crown the other. Historians and philologists are skeptical about the attribution to Wani because it cannot be found in earlier sources. Anyway, from the early 10th century on, this poem was regarded as a chorus that praises Emperor Nintoku. As a result, Wani was portrayed as a sage submitting to the emperor's virtue.

From the [[Heian period]] onward, references to Wani mostly involved the ''Naniwa-zu'' poem. Oddly some commentaries to Waka poems describe Wani as a man from Silla in southeastern Korea. Although this error was corrected by Fujiwara no Norikane's ''Waka d≈çm≈çsh≈ç'' (1145‚Äì53) and Kensh≈ç's ''Kokinsh≈´ jo ch≈´'' (1183) with the reference to the ''Nihon Shoki'', it survived for a long time. To solve the contradiction, Reizei Tamesuke even claimed in 1297 that Wani had been transferred from Baekje to Silla and then from Silla to Japan. A possible reason for this error is that Wani's arrival at Japan was interpreted as a result of Empress Jing≈´'s conquest of Silla, which was recorded in the ''Nihon Shoki''.&lt;ref name="kim1996"&gt;Kim Kwang-chol ÈáëÂÖâÂì≤, ''Naniwa-zu no uta to Wani'' Èõ£Ê≥¢Ê¥•„ÅÆÊ≠å„Å®Áéã‰ªÅ, The √îry√¥ Shigaku È∑πÈôµÂè≤Â≠¶, No. 22, pp.&amp;nbsp;33‚Äì60, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political exploitations==

===Hirakata===
The so-called tomb of Wani is located in [[Hirakata, Osaka|Hirakata]], [[Osaka Prefecture]]. It is, however, most likely that the alleged tomb identified in the 18th century has nothing to do with Wani.&lt;ref name="Goto:1994"&gt;(Got≈ç:1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

The "tomb" was located in Fujisaka Village, Kawachi Province (part of the modern-day Hirakata city). It was originally a pair of stones known to local people as "Oni Tomb" (ÊñºÁàæÂ¢ì). In other words, they were not associated with Wani. The situation changed in 1731 when the Confucian scholar Namikawa Seisho (‰∏¶Ê≤≥Ë™†ÊâÄ) visited there as part of the compilation of a geography monograph named Gokinaishi (‰∫îÁïøÂÜÖÂøó). He claimed that he discovered an old document at Wada Temple of Kin'ya Village (also part of the modern Hirakata) that read the name "Oni Tomb" was the corrupt form of ''Wani Tomb''. At his recommendation, a stonetomb was built behind the stones. It is generally considered that the "tomb" in Hirakata is Namikawa's fabrication. There is no ancient record that refers to Wani's burial site. Archaeologically speaking, there was no such custom of setting a tombstone on a mound before the introduction of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Goto:1994"/&gt;

The new myth spread as the [[Kokugaku]] movement became active. Wani was praised as a talented and faithful servant to the ancient emperors. In 1827, a monument in honor of Wani was erected near the tomb, on which his name was engraved by [[Prince Arisugawa Takahito|Prince Arisugawa]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], a ceremony was held at the tomb in 1899 to commemorate the 1500-year anniversary of the death of Emperor Nintoku.

After the annexation of Korea, another symbolic role was given to Wani in relation to modern Korea/Koreans. As part of an effort to integrate Korea into the empire, conciliatory approaches were adopted. Wani was utilized as a historical precedent for serving the emperor loyally in spite of non-Japanese root. In 1927 a society was set up in Tokyo to build a shrine for Wani. Its member included [[Uchida Ry≈çhei]] from the [[Black Dragon Society]]. The project for building a shrine in the site of the Wani tomb began in 1930. In 1932 the society celebrated the 1650-year anniversary of Wani's arrival there. The construction of Wani shrine started in 1940 but was never completed. In addition to Wani Shrine, a pair of monuments was built in honor of Wani in Tokyo's [[Ueno Park]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="Goto:1994"/&gt;

With the disintegration of the Japanese Empire, the political role of Wani ceased to exist. Instead, Wani was targeted by Korean political exploitation. Koreans, in turn, use Wani as a symbol of ancient Korea's "cultural superiority" over Japan. Since the 1980s Korean nationals in Japan have led various events visualizing Wani's alleged arrival at Japan. President [[Kim Dae-jung]] sent a personal letter to a ceremony at the tomb in 1998, and Prime Minister [[Kim Jong-pil]] visited there in 1999.&lt;ref name="Oishi:2004"&gt;(≈åishi:2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeongam===
Even though Korea has no historical records on Wani, "Doctor Wang In's Historical Sites" ('''Wang In''' is the Korean form of Wani, ÏôïÏù∏) are located in Gurim Village, [[Yeongam]] County, [[South Jeolla]] Province, [[South Korea]] today. It is based on a new myth that can date back only to the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Kim:2001"&gt;(Kim:2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier geography books including the ''Taekriji'' (1751) never link Wani to Yeongam. The first known record that associates Wani with Yeongam is the ''Joseon Hwanyeo Seungnam'' (ÊúùÈÆÆÂØ∞ËºøÂãùË¶ß; 1922‚Äì37) by Yi Byeong-yeon (Ïù¥Î≥ëÏó∞, ÊùéÁßâÂª∂). It claims without providing any evidence that Wani was born in Yeongnam.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Joseon Hwanyeo Seungnam'' makes mention of Wani's "tomb" in Hirakata.&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that around the same time, a Japanese monk named Aoki Keish≈ç claimed on the basis of "oral tradition" that Yeongam was Wani's homeland. In 1932 he made a failed appeal to erect a bronze statue of Wani in Yeongam.

A new myth about Wangin was publicized in South Korea in the 1970s. In 1972 the social activist Kim Changsu reported a series of essays titled "Korean spirit embodied in Japan," which appealed to South Koreans who felt starved for Korean superiority to Japan. In the framework of Korean national history, Wani was regarded as a Korean. Upon being informed by a reader from Yeongam, Kim issued a statement identifying Yeongam as the birthplace of Wani in the next year. In spite of the weakness of the evidence, Wani's "relic site" was designated as Cultural Asset No. 20 of South Jeolla Province in 1976.&lt;ref name="Kim:2001"/&gt;

The development of Wani's "historical sites" was led by the governments of South Jeolla Province and Yeongam County. The governor of South Jeolla Province was from Yeongam County.&lt;ref name="Oishi:2004"/&gt; The construction was carried out from 1985 to 1987, "restoring" the "birthplace", schools where Wani allegedly studied, and others. Yeongam County started to fully exploit the old-looking new theme park as a tourist attraction because the introduction of local autonomy of 1990 forced the local government to look for its own source of revenue. For example, Youngam County began to host the annual "Wangin Culture Festival" in 1997 that was previously organized by local people under the name of "Cherry blossom festival". The exploitation was not done without opposition. In fact, it is criticized by a faction who attempts to use Buddhist monk [[Doseon]] (827‚Äì898) as the main tourism resource of Yeongam.&lt;ref name="Oishi:2004"/&gt;
