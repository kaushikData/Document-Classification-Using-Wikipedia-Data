[[File:Ambrogio Fogar 1975b.jpg|thumb|Fogar in Egypt in 1975]]
'''Ambrogio Fogar''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: [ˈfɔːgaɾ]; 13 August 1941 – 23 August 2005) was an [[Italy|Italian]] sailor, writer, rally driver and all-round adventurer. He was a Commander of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]].

His exploits included a number of successful long-distance sailing feats, such as becoming the first Italian to sail single-handedly from east to west around the world. In 1978, after being capsized by [[killer whale]]s, he survived more than ten weeks in a life raft in the [[South Atlantic]] along with a friend, journalist Mauro Mancini, who died of [[pneumonia]] two days after the two were rescued. After this, Fogar largely abandoned sailing. He made an unsuccessful attempt to walk to the [[North Pole]] and competed several times in the [[Dakar Rally]].

In 1992 Fogar was paralysed from the neck down following a jeep accident while rallying in [[Turkmenistan]]. This did not end his adventurous spirit, and in 1997, in a wheelchair, he competed in a round-Italy yacht race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schiavi|first1=Giangiacomo|title=Io, Fogar, resisto immobile e solo da 12 anni|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2004/07_Luglio/20/fogar.shtml|language=Italian|accessdate=29 June 2015|work=Corriere.it|publisher=RCS Quotidiani|date=20 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 2005 of a heart attack and is buried at the [[Monumental Cemetery of Milan]], Italy.

Practices of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[animal sacrifice]] are mostly associated with [[Shaktism]], and in currents of [[folk Hinduism]] strongly rooted in local tribal traditions. Animal sacrifices were carried out in ancient times in India. Hindu scriptures such as the [[Gita]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u3IpAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22sacrifices+involving+the+animal+slaughter+are+prohibited%22&amp;dq=%22sacrifices+involving+the+animal+slaughter+are+prohibited%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDl46ZyOvLAhWIj44KHR8bDvoQ6AEIHDAA The Teachings of Bhagavad Gita] p.140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AHgRAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=gita+forbids+animal+sacrifice&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22An+environment-friendly+Gita+forbids+elaborate+Vedic+sacrifices+involving+animals%22 Bhagavad Gita and modern problems], p.143&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Purana]]s forbid  animal sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Rod Preece |title=Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCcwJtu_qQQC&amp;pg=PA202|year=2001|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=9780774807241|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors= Lisa Kemmerer, Anthony J.

==Terminology==
A [[Sanskrit]] term used for animal sacrifice is ''bali'', in origin meaning "tribute, offering or oblation" generically ("vegetable oblations [... and] animal oblations,").&lt;ref name="Rodrigues 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahavidya.ca/worship-rituals-and-festivals/blood-sacrifice-in-hinduism/|title=Blood Sacrifice in Hinduism|last=Rodrigues|first=Hillary|author2=Sumaiya Rizvi|date=10 June 2010|publisher=Mahavidya|page=1|accessdate=17 August 2010|archiveurl=http://www.mahavidya.ca/|archivedate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bali among other things "refers to the blood of an animal"&lt;ref name="Rodrigues 1"/&gt; and is sometimes known as [[Jhatka]] Bali&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O.P. Radhan |title=Encyclopaedia of Political Parties |volume=33 to 50|date=September 2002|publisher=Anmol, India |isbn=978-81-7488-865-5|page=854|id= {{ASIN|8174888659|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 75|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; among Hindus.

The [[Kalika Purana]] distinguishes ''bali'' (sacrifice), ''mahabali'' (great sacrifice), for the ritual killing of [[goat]]s, [[elephant]], respectively, though the reference to humans in [[Shakti]] theology is symbolic and done in [[effigy]] in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;"" Pramatha Nath Bose, ''A History of Hindu Civilization During British Rule'', vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7jyAnZX6VNkC&amp;pg=PA65 p. 65]
&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Sir John Woodroffe]] published a commentary on the Karpuradistotram, where he writes that the sacrificial animals listed in verse 19 are symbols for the [[Arishadvargas|six enemies]], with "man" representing pride.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/tantra/htk/htk03.htm Hymn to Kali: Preface]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
It is a ritual that is practiced today and is mentioned in Medieval Hinduism too. It is important to note that the practice of animal sacrifice is not a required ritual in some sects of  Hinduism.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=December 2014}} The majority of practicing Hindus today choose not to participate in or acknowledge the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farquhar J. N.|title=The Crown of Hinduism |date=1 November 2008|publisher=Unknown|isbn=978-1-4437-2397-8 |page=381|chapter=9 The Great Sects|id= {{ASIN|1443723975|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adherents of the Sakta sect of Hinduism hold this to be a central tenet of their belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipner Julius J.|authorlink=Julius J.

===Hindu scriptures===

The [[Ashvamedha]] ritual - in which a horse is sacrificed - is mentioned in the Vedic texts such as the ''[[Yajurveda]]''. In the epic ''[[Ramayana]]'', [[Rama]] performed the Ashvamedha sacrifice for becoming the [[Chakravartin]] emperor. In the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', [[Yudhishtra]] performs the Ashwamedha after winning the [[Kurukshetra war]] to become the Chakravartin emperor. The Mahabharata also contains a description of an Ashvamedha performed by the [[Chedi Kingdom|Chedi]] king Uparichara Vasu, however, no animals were sacrificed in this story.However, sacrifices were common in this ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT224|first=Roshen|last=Dalal|isbn=8184752776|year=2014|publisher=Penguin UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of the [[Gupta empire]], the [[Chalukya dynasty]], and the [[Chola dynasty]] all performed the Ashvamedha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT207 |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|page=207|author= Roshen Dalal|publisher= [[Penguin Books]]|isbn= 9788184752779|date=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Uma Marina Vesci|title= Heat and Sacrifice in the Vedas|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYWFdFUfBf8C&amp;pg=PA103 |publisher= Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|page= 103|year= 1992|isbn= 9788131716779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medieval [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Krishna]] tells people not to perform animal sacrifices. Animal sacrifices are forbidden by the Bhagavata Purana in the ''[[Kaliyuga]]'', the present age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3Z8CGJBo3z4C&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=purana+kaliyuga+animal+sacrifice |title=Authority, Anxiety, and Canon: Essays in Vedic Interpretation - Google Books |accessdate=2015-02-18|isbn=9780791419373 |last1=Patton |first1=Laurie L |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brahma Vaivarta Purana]] describes animal sacrifices as ''kali-varjya'' or prohibited in the ''Kaliyuga''.&lt;ref name="Holy Cow"&gt;{{cite book|title=Holy Cow: The Hare Krishna Contribution to Vegetarianism and Animal Rights|first=Steve|last=Rosen|page=24|year=2004|publisher=Lantern Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adi Purana, Brihan-naradiya Purana and Aditya Purana also forbid animal sacrifice in Kaliyuga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=91xAzuqbha0C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=purana |title=Hindu Widow Marriage - Īśvaracandra Bidyāsāgara - Google Books |date=2013-08-13 |accessdate=2015-02-18|isbn=9780231526609 |last1=Vidyasagar |first1=Ishvarchandra }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal sacrifice in contemporary Hindu society===

Animal sacrifice is a part of some Durga puja celebrations during the Navratri in eastern states of India. The goddess is offered sacrificial animal in this ritual in the belief that it stimulates her violent vengeance against the buffalo demon.&lt;ref name=fuller83&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher John Fuller|title=The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=To6XSeBUW3oC |year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12048-5|pages=46, 83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Chris Fuller (academic)|Christopher Fuller]], the animal sacrifice practice is rare among Hindus during Navratri, or at other times, outside the [[Shaktism]] tradition found in the eastern Indian states of West Bengal, Odisha&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardenberg|first1=Roland|title=Visnu's Sleep, Mahisa's Attack, Durga's Victory: Concepts of Royalty in a Sacrificial Drama|journal=Journal of Social Science|date=2000|volume=4|issue=4|page=267|url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JSS/JSS-04-0-000-000-2000-Web/JSS-04-04-227-2000-Abst-PDF/JSS-04-04-261-276-2000.pdf|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Assam.

==Method of sacrifice==
Methods for sacrificing range from decapitation, strangulation, to a spike being driven into the heart of the animal.

[[Jhatka]] is the prescribed method for Hindu [[ritual slaughter]], however other methods such as strangulation and the use of a wooden spile (sphya) driven into the heart is used.&lt;ref&gt;Dutt 2008:195&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is priests see an animal making a noise as a bad omen and the animal making noise indicates that it is suffering. The Jhatka method requires the instant killing of the animal in a single [[decapitation|decapitating]] blow with an axe or sword. Those Hindus who eat meat prescribe meat killed by the Jhatka method.

The term '''anthroposystem''' is used to describe the anthropological analogue to the [[ecosystem]]. In other words, the anthroposystem model serves to compare the flow of materials through human systems to those in naturally occurring systems.  As defined by Santos, an anthroposystem is "the orderly combination or arrangement of physical and biological [[Natural environment|environments]] for the purpose of maintaining human civilization...built by man to sustain his kind."  The anthroposystem is intimately linked to [[Economic system|economic]] and [[ecosystem|ecological]] systems as well.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Husar3.png|300px|thumb]] --&gt;
==Description==
Both the anthroposystem and ecosystem can be divided into three groups: producers, [[heterotroph|consumers]], and [[Recycling|recyclers]]. In the ecosystem, the producers or [[autotroph]]s consist of plants and some [[bacteria]] capable of producing their own food via [[photosynthesis]] or [[chemical synthesis]], the consumers consist of animals that obtain energy from grazing and/or by feeding on other animals and the recyclers consist of [[decomposer]]s such as [[Fungus|fungi]] and bacteria.

In the anthroposystem, the [[Factors of production|producers]] consist of the [[energy]] production through [[fossil fuel]]s, manufacturing with non-fuel [[mineral]]s and growing food; the [[consumer]]s consist of humans and domestic animals and the recyclers consist of the decomposing or recycling activities (i.e. [[Sewage treatment|waste water treatment]], metal and solid waste recycling). &lt;br&gt;

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Husar2.png|300px|thumb]] --&gt;

The ecosystem is [[sustainability|sustainable]]  whereas the anthroposystem is not. The ecosystem is a [[closed-loop controller|closed loop]] in which nearly everything is recycled whereas the anthroposystem is an [[Open-loop controller|open loop]] where very little is recycled.  In contrast to the ecosystem, the anthroposystem's producers and consumers are significantly more spatially displaced than those in the ecosystem and thus, more energy is required to transfer matter to a producer or recycler. Currently, a large majority of this energy comes from non-renewable fossil fuels.

Additionally, recycling is a naturally occurring component of the ecosystem, and is responsible for much of the [[Natural resource|resources]] used by the system. Under the anthroposystem [[Model (abstract)|model]], however, recycling does not naturally occur. Outside input is relied on for material and energy supplies, and recycling systems that do exist are artificially created. The process of improving the flow of energy, such that waste can be reused as input resources, is known as industrial ecology.

A matrix can be used to describe the anthropological network of producers, consumers and recyclers and the movement of materials between each. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Network.png|400px|thumb]]  --&gt;

However, the matrix model of the anthroposystem - based on a model for the ecosystem - fails in acknowledging the physical redistribution of mobilized matter. In developing the anthroposystem model, there is a trade-off between simplicity and completeness.  A simple representative model can be created involving only producers, consumers, and recyclers, but this is an open, incomplete system.  More components and analogues (such as a matrix that encompasses the producers, consumers and recyclers) can be added to the system to make a more complete model, but the model loses simplicity in the process.  Though the anthroposystem concept is flawed in this manner, it is a very good starting point for analyzing human activities and their effects on the environment.

When viewing the Earth as one large anthroposystem, we are essentially eliminating the uncertainty in material flow. All goods (i.e. fossil fuels) will still exist in the system but in a new form (i.e. pollutants). Therefore, the Laws of [[Law of conservation of matter|Conservation of Matter]] and [[Law of conservation of energy|Conservation of Energy]] can be applied to analyze how material flow will impact the environment.

'''Atmospheric instability''' is a condition where the [[Earth's atmosphere]] is generally considered to be [[unstable]] and as a result the [[weather]] is subjected to a high degree of variability through distance and time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Weather/Older/Stability_of_Air.html Stability of Air] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209030952/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Weather/Older/Stability_of_Air.html |date=February 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atmospheric stability is a measure of the atmosphere's tendency to discourage or deter vertical motion, and vertical motion is directly correlated to different types of weather systems and their severity. In unstable conditions, a lifted thing, such as a [[air parcel|parcel of air]] will be warmer than the surrounding air at altitude. Because it is warmer, it is less dense and is prone to further ascent.

In [[meteorology]], instability can be described by various indices such as the [[Bulk Richardson Number]], [[lifted index]], [[K-index (meteorology)|K-index]], [[convective available potential energy|convective available potential energy (CAPE)]], the Showalter, and the Vertical totals.  These indices, as well as atmospheric instability itself, involve [[temperature]] changes through the [[troposphere]] with height, or [[lapse rate]].  Effects of atmospheric instability in moist atmospheres include [[thunderstorm]] development, which over warm oceans can lead to [[tropical cyclogenesis]], and [[turbulence]].  In dry atmospheres, inferior [[mirage]]s, [[dust devil]]s, steam devils, and [[fire whirl]]s can form.  Stable atmospheres can be associated with [[drizzle]], [[fog]], increased [[air pollution]], a lack of turbulence, and [[undular bore]] formation.

==Forms==

There are two primary forms of atmospheric instability:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piercecollege.edu/offices/weather/stability.html Explanation of Atmospheric Stability/Instability - by Steve W. Woodruff] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612212855/http://www.piercecollege.edu/offices/weather/stability.html |date=June 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Convective instability]]
* [[Dynamic instability (fluid mechanics)]]

Under '''convective instability''' thermal mixing through [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] in the form of warm air rising leads to the development of [[clouds]] and possibly [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] or [[convective storms]].  '''Dynamic instability''' is produced through the horizontal movement of air and the physical forces it is subjected to such as the [[Coriolis force]] and [[pressure gradient force]]. Dynamic lifting and mixing produces cloud, precipitation and storms often on a [[synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic scale]].

== Cause of instability ==
{{See also|Lapse rate}}
Whether or not the atmosphere has stability depends partially on the moisture content.  In a very dry troposphere, a temperature decrease with height less than 9.8C per kilometer ascent indicates stability, while greater changes indicate instability.  This lapse rate is known as the dry adiabatic lapse rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-mwbAsxpRr0C&amp;pg=PA448&amp;dq=lapse+rate+meteorology+book#v=onepage&amp;q=lapse%20rate%20meteorology%20book&amp;f=false|page=449|author=John E. Oliver|title=Encyclopedia of world climatology|publisher=Springer|date=2005-08-23|accessdate=2012-02-24|isbn=978-1-4020-3264-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a completely moist troposphere, a temperature decrease with height less than 6C per kilometer ascent indicates stability, while greater changes indicate instability.  In the range between 6C and 9.8C temperature decrease per kilometer ascent, the term conditionally unstable is used.

==Indices used for its determination==
{{See also|Bulk Richardson Number|Convective available potential energy|K-index (meteorology)|Lifted index}}

===Lifted Index===
The lifted index (LI), usually expressed in [[kelvin]]s, is the temperature difference between the temperature of the environment Te(p) and an air parcel lifted [[Adiabatic process|adiabatically]] Tp(p) at a given pressure height in the troposphere, usually 500 [[Pascal (unit)|hPa]] ([[Bar (unit)|mb]]). When the value is positive, the atmosphere (at the respective height) is stable and when the value is negative, the atmosphere is unstable.  Thunderstorms are expected with values below -2, and [[severe weather]] is anticipated with values below -6.&lt;ref name="agua"&gt;{{cite book|pages=416–418|title=Understanding weather and climate|author1=Edward Aguado  |author2=James E.

The K index is derived arithmetically: K-index = (850 hPa temperature - 500 hPa temperature) + 850 hPa [[dew point]] - 700 hPa dew point depression

* The temperature difference between 850 hPa ({{convert|5000|ft|m}} above sea level) and 500 hPa ({{convert|18000|ft|m}} above sea level) is used to parameterize the vertical temperature lapse rate.
* The 850 hPa dew point provides information on the moisture content of the lower atmosphere.
* The vertical extent of the moist layer is represented by the difference of the 700 hPa temperature ({{convert|10000|ft|m}} above sea level) and 700 hPa dew point.&lt;ref name="agua"/&gt;

===CAPE and CIN===
[[File:CAPE vs SHEAR.png|right|thumb|250 px|Conditions favorable for thunderstorm types and complexes]]
Convective available potential energy (CAPE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. W. Moncrieff |author2=M.J. Miller | year = 1976 | title = The dynamics and simulation of tropical cumulonimbus and squall lines | journal = Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. | volume = 120 | pages = 373&amp;ndash;94 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/113524305/ | doi = 10.1002/qj.49710243208 | format = abstract|bibcode = 1976QJRMS.102..373M | issue = 432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes, simply, available potential energy (APE), is the amount of [[energy]] a parcel of air would have if lifted a certain distance vertically through the atmosphere.  CAPE is effectively the positive [[buoyancy]] of an air parcel and is an indicator of atmospheric instability, which makes it valuable in predicting severe weather.  CIN, [[convective inhibition]], is effectively negative buoyancy, expressed '''B-'''; the opposite of [[convective available potential energy|convective available potential energy (CAPE)]], which is expressed as B+ or simply B. As with CAPE, CIN is usually expressed in J/kg but may also be expressed as m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, as the values are equivalent. In fact, CIN is sometimes referred to as '''negative buoyant energy''' ('''NBE''').

It is a form of fluid instability found in thermally stratified atmospheres in which a colder fluid overlies a warmer one.  When an air mass is unstable, the element of the air mass that is displaced upwards is accelerated by the pressure differential between the displaced air and the ambient air at the (higher) altitude to which it was displaced. This usually creates vertically developed clouds from convection, due to the rising motion, which can eventually lead to thunderstorms. It could also be created in other phenomenon, such as a cold front. Even if the air is cooler on the surface, there is still warmer air in the mid-levels, that can rise into the upper-levels. However, if there is not enough water vapor present, there is no ability for condensation, thus storms, clouds, and rain will not form.

===Bulk Richardson Number===
The Bulk Richardson Number (BRN) is a dimensionless number relating vertical stability and vertical wind shear (generally, stability divided by shear). It represents the ratio of thermally-produced turbulence and turbulence generated by vertical shear.  Practically, its value determines whether [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] is free or forced. High values indicate unstable and/or weakly sheared [[natural environment|environment]]s; low values indicate weak instability and/or strong vertical shear. Generally, values in the range of around 10 to 45 suggest environmental conditions favorable for [[supercell]] development.

===Showalter index===
The Showalter index is a dimensionless number computed by taking the temperature at the 850&amp;nbsp;hPa level which is then taken dry adiabatically up to saturation, then up to the 500&amp;nbsp;hPa level, which is then subtracted by the observed 500&amp;nbsp;hPa level temperature.  If the value is negative, then the lower portion of the atmosphere is unstable, with thunderstorms expected when the value is below −3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z0_Tc_pKXKEC&amp;pg=PA347&amp;dq=showalter+index+book#v=onepage&amp;q=showalter%20index%20book&amp;f=false|page=347|title=Advances in tropical meteorology: meteorology and national development: proceedings of the National Symposium TROPMET-93 organised by the Indian Meteorological Society at New Delhi from March 17-19, 1993 with the theme "meteorology and national development"|author=Rattan K. Datta|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|date=1996-01-01|access-date=2012-02-26|isbn=978-81-7022-532-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the Showalter index is especially helpful when there is a cool, shallow air mass below 850&amp;nbsp;hPa that conceals the potential convective lifting. However, the index will underestimate the potential convective lifting if there are cool layers that extend above 850 hPa and it does not consider [[Diurnal cycle|diurnal]] radiative changes or moisture below 850 hPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=SHOWALTER%20INDEX |title=NOAA's National Weather Service - Glossary |publisher=NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approaching boundary will create a disturbance in the atmosphere producing a wave-like motion, known as a [[gravity wave]].   Although the undular bore waves appear as bands of clouds across the sky, they are [[transverse waves]], and are propelled by the transfer of energy from an oncoming storm and are shaped by gravity. The ripple like appearance of this wave is described as the disturbance in the water when a pebble is dropped into a pond or when a moving boat creates waves in the surrounding water. The object displaces the water or [[Transmission medium|medium]] the wave is travelling through and the medium moves in an upward motion.  However, because of gravity, the water or medium is pulled back down and the repetition of this cycle creates the transverse wave motion.&lt;ref name="Mauritania"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arpal.org/Pubbl/paper/eumetsat-mauritania.pdf |title=Outflow from convective storm, Mauritania and adjacent Atlantic Ocean (13 August 2006) |author1=Martin Setvak |author2=Jochen Kerkmann |author3=Alexander Jacob |author4=HansPeter Roesli |author5=Stefano Gallino |author6=Daniel Lindsey |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=2009-07-03 |date=2007-03-19 |publisher=Agenzia Regionale per la Protezione dell'Ambiente Ligure |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725013807/http://www.arpal.org/Pubbl/paper/eumetsat-mauritania.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unstable atmosphere===
[[File:Hot road mirage.jpg|thumb|right|Mirage over a hot road, with the appearance of "fake water" on its surface]] 
Within an unstable layer in the troposphere, the lifting of air parcels will occur, and continue for as long as the nearby atmosphere remains unstable.  Once overturning through the depth of the troposphere occurs (with convection being capped by the relatively warmer, more stable layer of the [[stratosphere]]), deep convective currents lead to thunderstorm development when enough moisture is present.  Over warm ocean waters and within a region of the troposphere with light vertical [[wind shear]] and significant low level spin (or vorticity), such thunderstorm activity can grow in coverage and develop into a [[tropical cyclone]].&lt;ref name="A15"&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Landsea |authorlink=Chris Landsea |publisher=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]] |work=Frequently Asked Questions: Hurricanes, Typhoons and Tropical Cyclones |title=How do tropical cyclones form? |accessdate=2006-07-25 |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827030639/http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A15.html |archivedate=2009-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over hot surfaces during warm days, unstable dry air can lead to significant refraction of the light within the air layer, which causes inferior [[mirage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 2009|page=167|journal=Physics Education|volume=44|issue=2|publisher=IOP Publishing Limited|author=Michael Vollmer|title=Mirrors in the air: mirages in nature and in the laboratory|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/44/2/008|bibcode = 2009PhyEd..44..165V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biosafety''' is the prevention of large-scale loss of [[biological integrity]], focusing both on [[ecology]] and [[human health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biosafety and the environment: An introduction to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/press/presskits/bs/cpbs-unep-cbd-en.pdf|series=GE.03-01836/E |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These prevention mechanisms include conduction of regular reviews of the biosafety in laboratory settings, as well as strict guidelines to follow. Biosafety is used to protect from harmful incidents. Many laboratories handling biohazards employ an ongoing risk management assessment and enforcement process for biosafety.  Failures to follow such protocols can lead to increased risk of exposure to biohazards or pathogens. [[Human error]] and poor technique contribute to unnecessary exposure and compromise the best safeguards set into place for protection.

The international [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]] deals primarily with the agricultural definition but many advocacy groups seek to expand it to include post-genetic threats: new molecules, artificial life forms, and even robots which may compete directly in the natural food chain.

Biosafety in agriculture, chemistry, medicine, exobiology and beyond will likely require the application of the [[precautionary principle]], and a new definition focused on the biological nature of the threatened organism rather than the nature of the threat.

When [[biological warfare]] or new, currently hypothetical, threats (i.e., robots, new artificial bacteria) are considered, biosafety precautions are generally not sufficient. (link to incident report, i.e. such as problems with CDC research labs in 2014)The new field of [[biosecurity]] addresses these complex threats.

[[Biosafety level]] refers to the stringency of [[biocontainment]] precautions deemed necessary by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) for laboratory work with infectious materials.

Typically, institutions that experiment with or create potentially harmful biological material will have a committee or board of supervisors that is in charge of the institution's biosafety. They create and monitor the biosafety standards that must be met by labs in order to prevent the accidental release of potentially destructive biological material. (note that in the US, several groups are involved, and efforts are being made to improve processes for government run labs, but there is no unifying regulatory authority for all labs.

Biosafety is related to several fields:

* In [[ecology]] (referring to imported life forms from beyond [[ecoregion]] borders),
* In [[agriculture]] (reducing the risk of alien viral or [[transgenic]] genes, [[genetic engineering]] or prions such as BSE/"MadCow", reducing the risk of food bacterial contamination)
* In [[medicine]] (referring to organs or tissues from biological origin, or genetic therapy products, virus; levels of [[biocontainment|lab containment]] protocols measured as 1, 2, 3, 4 in rising order of danger),
* In [[chemistry]] (i.e., nitrates in water, PCB levels affecting fertility)
* In [[exobiology]] (i.e., NASA's policy for containing alien microbes that may exist on space samples. See [[planetary protection]] and [[interplanetary contamination]]), and
* In [[synthetic biology]] (referring to the risks associated with this type of lab practice)

==In synthetic biology==
High-security facilities are necessary when working with [[synthetic biology]] as there are possibilities of [[bioterrorism]] acts or release of harmful chemicals and or organisms into the environment. A complete understanding of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology is helping to enforce the knowledge and effectiveness of biosafety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Serrano|first=Luis|title=Molecular Systems Biology|url=http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v3/n1/full/msb4100202.html|publisher=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the potential future creation of man-made unicellular organisms, some are beginning to consider the effect that these organisms will have on biomass already present. Scientists estimate that within the next few decades, organism design will be sophisticated enough to accomplish tasks such as creating biofuels and lowering the levels of harmful substances in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=James|title=Synthetic Biology: Bits and pieces come to life|journal=Nature|date=|volume=483|issue=7387|pages=S8–S10|doi=10.1038/483S8a|pmid=22378128|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7387_supp/full/483S8a.html|accessdate=12 April 2012|year=2012|bibcode=2012Natur.483S...8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientist that favor the development of synthetic biology claim that the use of biosafety mechanisms such as suicide genes and nutrient dependencies will ensure the organisms cannot survive outside of the lab setting in which they were originally created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Self-Replicating Synthetic Bacterial Cell|url=http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/first-self-replicating-synthetic-bacterial-cell/faq/#q8|publisher=J. Craig Venter Institute|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations like the [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]] argue that regulations should control the creation of organisms that could potentially harm existing life. They also argue that the development of these organisms will simply shift the consumption of petroleum to the utilization of biomass in order to create energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silvia Ribeiro|first=Ribeiro|title=News Release: Biofuels, Bioenergy and Biochar: False Solutions Lead to Land-Grabbing|url=http://www.etcgroup.org/en/node/5243|accessdate=12 April 2012|date=December 3, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501211305/http://www.etcgroup.org/en/node/5243|archivedate=1 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organisms can harm existing life by affecting the prey/predator food chain, reproduction between species, as well as competition against other species (species at risk, or act as an invasive species).
[[Synthetic vaccine]]s are now being produced in the lab. These have caused a lot of excitement in the [[pharmaceutical industry]] as they will be cheaper to produce, allow quicker production, as well enhance the knowledge of [[virology]] and [[immunology]].

==In medicine, healthcare settings and laboratories==
{{see also|Biosafety level}}

Biosafety, in medicine and health care settings, specifically refers to proper handling of organs or tissues from biological origin, or genetic therapy products, viruses with respect to the environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of BIOSAFETY|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/biosafety|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure the safety of health care workers, researchers, lab staff, patients, and the general public. Laboratories are assigned a biosafety level numbered 1 through 4 based on their potential biohazard risk level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biosafety.be/RA/Class/ClassINT.html#UNITED_STATES|accessdate=October 9, 2016|title=International classification schemes for micro-organisms based on their biological risks # UNITED STATES|date=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The employing authority, through the laboratory director, is responsible for ensuring that there is adequate surveillance of the health of laboratory personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laboratory Biosafety Manual - Third Edition|url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/biosafety/en/Biosafety7.pdf|website=World Health Organization|publisher=WHO|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of such surveillance is to monitor for occupationally acquired diseases.&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt; The World Health Organization attributes human error and poor technique&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt; as the primary cause of mishandling of biohazardous materials.

Biosafety is becoming also a global concern and require multilevel resources and international collaboration to monitor, prevent and correct accidents from unintended and malicious release and also to prevent that bioterrorists get their hands-on biologics sample to create biologic weapons of mass destruction.  Even people outside of the health sector needs to be involved as in the case of the Ebola outbreak the impact that it had on businesses and travel required that private sectors, international banks together pledged more than $2 billion to combat the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/t/us/2015/237560.htm|title=Biosecurity in the Time of Ebola|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bureau of international Security and nonproliferation (ISN) is responsible for managing a broad range of U.S. nonproliferation policies, programs, agreements, and initiatives, and biological weapon is one their concerns
Biosafety has its risks and benefits. All stakeholders must try to find a balance between cost-effectiveness of safety measures and use evidence-based safety practices and recommendations, measure the outcomes and consistently reevaluate the potential benefits that biosafety represents for human health.
Biosafety level designations are based on a composite of the design features, construction, containment facilities, equipment, practices and operational procedures required for working with agents from the various risk groups.&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt;

Classification of biohazardous materials is subjective and the risk assessment is determined by the individuals most familiar with the specific characteristics of the organism.&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt; There are several factors taken into account when assessing an organism and the classification process.

*Risk Group 1: (no or low individual and community risk) A [[microorganism]] that is unlikely to cause human or animal disease.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biosafety.be/RA/Class/ClassINT.html#UNITED_STATES|title=International Classification Systems for Micro-organisms|first=|last=SBB©2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Risk Group 2 : (moderate individual risk, low community risk) A [[pathogen]] that can cause human or animal disease but is unlikely to be a serious hazard to laboratory workers, the community, livestock or the environment. Laboratory exposures may cause serious infection, but effective treatment and preventive measures are available and the risk of spread of infection is limited.&lt;ref name=CDCMan&gt;{{cite web|title=Laboratory Biosafety Manual|url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/biosafety/en/Biosafety7.pdf|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Risk Group 3 : (high individual risk, low community risk) A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal disease but does not ordinarily spread from one infected individual to another. Effective treatment and preventive measures are available.&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt;
*Risk Group 4 : (high individual and community risk) A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal disease and that can be readily transmitted from one individual to another, directly or indirectly. Effective treatment and preventive measures are not usually available.&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt;

Investigations have shown that there are hundreds of unreported biosafety accidents, with laboratories self-policing the handling of biohazardous materials and lack of reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Young A|author2=Penzenstadler N, TODAY|title= Inside America's secretive biolabs|work=USA Today|date=May 28, 2015|url=https://www.usatoday.com/longform/news/2015/05/28/biolabs-pathogens-location-incidents/26587505/|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor record keeping, improper disposal, and mishandling biohazardous materials result in increased risks of biochemical contamination for both the public and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House issues report on improving biosafety at federal labs|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-whitehouse-biosafety-idUSKCN0SN34F20151029|date=October 29, 2015|accessdate=September 3, 2016|first=Julie|last=Steenhuysen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the precautions taken during the handling process of biohazardous materials, the World Health Organization recommends:
Staff training should always include information on safe methods for highly hazardous procedures that are commonly encountered by all laboratory personnel and which involve:&lt;ref name=CDCMan/&gt;
#Inhalation risks (i.e. aerosol production) when using loops, streaking agar plates,
#pipetting, making smears, opening cultures, taking blood/serum samples, centrifuging, etc.
#Ingestion risks when handling specimens, smears and cultures
#Risks of [[percutaneous]] exposures when using syringes and needles
#Bites and scratches when handling animals
#Handling of blood and other potentially hazardous pathological materials
#Decontamination and disposal of infectious material.

==Policy and practice in the United States==

===Legal information===
In June 2009, the Trans-Federal Task Force On Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight recommended the formation of an agency to coordinate high safety risk level labs (3 and 4), and voluntary, non-punitive measures for incident reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/is/br/bbotaskforce/biosafety-FINAL-REPORT-092009.pdf |title=Report of the Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight  |date=July 2009  |publisher=ars.usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear as to what changes may or may not have been implemented following their recommendations.

Vol TITLE 42—Public Health|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=868d2d34fe582976da6e893468fa7eb6&amp;pitd=20150101&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title42/42cfr73_main_02.tpl|accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:International Biohazard Warning Symbol.svg|thumb|International Biohazard Warning Symbol]]
Title 42 Section 73 of the CFR addresses specific aspects of biosafety including [[Occupational safety and health]], transportation of biohazardous materials and safety plans for laboratories using potential biohazards. While [[biocontainment]], as defined in the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories&lt;ref name=CDCbiosafety&gt;{{cite web|title=Biosafety Publications and Forms|publisher=CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/index.htm|accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Primary Containment for Biohazards: Selection, Installation and Use of Biosafety Cabinets&lt;ref name=CDCbiosafety /&gt; manuals available at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] website much of the design, implementation and monitoring of protocols are left up to state and local authorities.&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;
 
The United States CFR states  "An individual or entity required to register [as a user of biological agents] must develop and implement a written biosafety plan that is commensurate with the risk of the select agent or toxin"&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt; which is followed by 3 recommended sources for laboratory reference.

#The CDC/NIH publication, "Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories."&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;
#The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations in 29 CFR parts 1910.1200 and 1910.1450.&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;
#The "NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules," (NIH Guidelines).&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;

While clearly the needs of [[biocontainment]] and biosafety measures vary across government, academic and private industry laboratories, [[biological agents]] pose similar risks independent of their locale.&lt;ref name=TIAN2014&gt;Tian D, Zheng T. Comparison and Analysis of Biological Agent Category Lists Based On Biosafety and Biodefense. PLoS One. 2014;9(6). {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0101163}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Laws relating to biosafety are not easily accessible and there are few federal regulations that are readily available for a potential trainee to reference outside of the publications recommended in 42 CFR 73.12.&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt;&lt;ref name=CDCbiosafety /&gt; Therefore, training is the responsibility of lab employers&lt;ref name=E-CFR /&gt; and is not consistent across various laboratory types thereby increasing the risk of accidental release of [[biological hazards]] that pose serious health threats to the humans, animals and the [[ecosystem]] as a whole.

====Agency guidance====

Many government agencies have made guidelines and recommendations in an effort to increase biosafety measures across laboratories in the United States.  Agencies involved in producing policies surrounding biosafety within a hospital, pharmacy or clinical research laboratory include: the CDC, [[FDA]], [[USDA]], [[DHHS]], DoT, [[EPA]] and potentially other local organizations including public health departments.  The federal government does set some standards and recommendations for States to meet their standards, most of which fall under the [[Occupational Health and Safety Act]] of 1970.&lt;ref name="osha.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/osp/|title=Directorate of Cooperative and State Programs - State Plans|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; but currently, there is no single federal regulating agency directly responsible for ensuring the safety of biohazardous handling, storage, identification, clean-up and disposal.  In addition to the CDC, the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] has some of the most accessible information on ecological impacts of biohazards, how to handle spills, reporting guidelines and proper disposal of agents dangerous to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/regulatory-information-topic/regulatory-information-topic-waste#hazardous|title=Regulatory Information by Topic: Waste|first=US|last=EPA, OEI, OIAA, IAD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these agencies have their own manuals and guidance documents relating to training and certain aspects of biosafety directly tied to their agency's scope, including transportation, storage and handling of blood borne pathogens. (OSHA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3186.pdf |title=Model Plans and Programs for the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens and Hazard Communications Standards |year=2003 |publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IATA]]).  The American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) has a list of such agencies and links to their websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.absa.org/resbslinks.html|title=ABSA - Biosafety Links|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with links to publications and guidance documents to assist in risk assessment, lab design and adherence to laboratory exposure control plans. Many of these agencies were members of the 2009 Task Force on BioSafety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/boards/biosafetytaskforce/Pages/taskforcemembership.aspx|title=BioSafety Task Force Membership - PHE|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103173822/https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/boards/biosafetytaskforce/Pages/taskforcemembership.aspx|archive-date=2017-01-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a formation of a [[Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense]], but this is more concernend with national defense programs and biosecurity.

Ultimately states and local governments, as well as private industry labs, are left to make the final determinants for their own biosafety programs, which vary widely in scope and enforcement across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triumvirate.com/State-by-state-Biosafety-Regulations|title=State-by-state Biosafety Regulations  - Resource Page|first=Triumvirate|last=Environmental|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all state programs address biosafety from all necessary perspectives, which should not just include personal safety, but also emphasize an full understanding among laboratory personnel of quality control and assurance, exposure potential impacts on the environment, and general public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHA3404laboratory-safety-guidance.pdf |title=Laboratory Safety Guidance |year=2011 |publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State occupational safety plans are often focused on transportation, disposal, and risk assessment, allowing caveats for safety audits, but ultimately leaves the training in the hands of the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/migrate/uploads/AAAS-Biosafety-report.pdf |title=Biological Safety Training Programs as a Component of Personnel Reliability  |type=Workshop Report  |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science | author1=Kavita Marfatia Berger|author2=Kathryn A. Luke|author3=Mark S. Frankel|author4=Jennifer L. Sta.Ana |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  22 states have approved Occupational Safety plans by OSHA that are audited annually for effectiveness.&lt;ref name="osha.gov"/&gt; These plans apply to private and public sector workers, and not necessarily state/ government workers, and not all specifically have a comprehensive program for all aspects of biohazard management from start to finish.  Sometimes biohazard management plans are limited only to workers in transportation specific job titles.  The enforcement and training on such regulations can vary from lab to lab based on the State's plans for occupational health and safety.  With the exception of DoD lab personnel, CDC lab personnel, First responders, and DoT employees, enforcement of training is inconsistent, and while training is required to be done, specifics on the breadth and frequency of refresher training does not seem consistent from state to state; penalties may never be assessed without larger regulating bodies being aware of non-compliance, and enforcement is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.councilforresponsiblegenetics.org/pageDocuments/T6CQ5HCITM.pdf |title=Biological Laboratories: Risks and Regulations |last=Buyon |first=Lucas  |publisher=Council for Responsible Genetics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Medical waste management in the United States ====
{{see also|Medical Waste Tracking Act}}
[[Medical waste]] management was identified as an issue in the 1980s; with the [[Medical Waste Tracking Act]] of 1988&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulated Biohazard Waste Regulations|url=http://biohazardwasteregulations.com/|website=Biohazard Waste Regulations|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the new standard in biohazard [[waste disposal]].

Although the Federal Government, EPA &amp; DOT provide some oversight of regulated medical waste storage, transportation, and disposal the majority of biohazard medical waste is regulated at the state level.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Each state is responsible for regulation and management of their own bioharzardous waste with each state varying in their regulatory process. Record keeping of biohazardous waste also varies between states.

Medical healthcare centers, hospitals veterinary clinics, clinical laboratories and other facilities generate over one million tons of waste each year.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Although the majority of this waste is as harmless as common household waste, as much as 15 percent of this waste poses a potential infection hazard, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Medical waste is required to be rendered non-infectious before it can be disposed of.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; There are several different methods to treat and dispose of biohazardous waste. In the United States, the 
primary methods for treatment and disposal of biohazard, medical and sharps waste may include:&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
* [[Incineration]]
* Microwave
* [[Autoclaves]]
* Mechanical/Chemical Disinfection
*[[Irradiation]]

Different forms of biohazardous wasted required different treatments for their proper waste management. This is determined largely be each states regulations. Currently, there are several contracted companies that focus on medical, sharps and biological hazard disposal. Stericycle is one of the leaders in medical waste and pharmaceutical disposal in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stericycle.com/about-us|title=About - Stericycle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidents of non-compliance and reform efforts===

The United States Government has made it clear that biosafety is to be taken very seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/biosafety-and-biosecurity-united-states|title=Biosafety and Biosecurity in the United States - Homeland Security|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, incidents with Anthrax and Ebola pathogens in CDC laboratories (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/s0204-ebola-lab.html|title=CDC Press Releases|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/news-multimedia/lab-incident/|title=CDC Lab Incident: Anthrax, June 2014 - Anthrax - CDC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), prompted the CDC director [[Tom Frieden]] to issue a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] for research with these types of [[select agent]]s.  An investigation concluded that there was a lack of adherence to safety protocols and "inadequate safeguards" in place.  This indicated a lack of proper training or reinforcement of training and supervision on regular basis for lab personnel.

Following these incidents, the CDC established an ''External Laboratory Safety Workgroup'' (ELSW),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/about/lab-safety/laboratory-safety-workgroup/workgroup.html|title=Laboratory Safety at CDC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggestions have been made to reform effectiveness of the Federal Select Agent Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selectagents.gov/|title=Federal Select Agent Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White house issued a report on national biosafety priorities in 2015, outlining next steps for a national biosafety and security program, and addressed biological safety needs for health research, national defense, and public safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/10-2015_biosafety_and_biosecurity_memo.pdf |title=Biosafety and biosecurity memo |date=October 29, 2015 |publisher=www.whitehouse.gov |access-date=2016-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120141923/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/10-2015_biosafety_and_biosecurity_memo.pdf |archive-date=2017-01-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) had a presentation at their annual meeting focused on improving biosafety culture.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aphl.org/conferences/proceedings/Documents/2016_Annual_Meeting/23Monroe{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This same year, The UPMC Center for Health Security issued a case study report including reviews of ten different nations' current biosafety regulations, including the United States.  Their goal was to "provide a foundation for identifying national‐level biosafety norms and enable initial assessment of biosafety priorities necessary for developing effective national biosafety regulation and oversight."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2016/Combined%20Biosafety%20Case%20Studies%20final%20draft%20062116.pdf |title=NATIONAL BIOSAFETY SYSTEM |author1=Gigi Kwik Gronvall |author2=Matthew P Shearer |author3=Hannah Collins |date=July 2016 |publisher=UPMC Center for Health Security |access-date=2016-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109085425/http://www.upmchealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2016/Combined%20Biosafety%20Case%20Studies%20final%20draft%20062116.pdf |archive-date=2016-11-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Cellulose]] fibers''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|lj|ʊ|l|oʊ|s|,_|-|l|oʊ|z}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cellulose Fibre - definition of cellulose fibre in the Free Online Enciclopedy|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/cellulose+fiber|publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com|The Free Online Dictionary]]|accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, spelled as "fibre" in most of the English speaking world, are fibers made with [[Ether|ethers]] or [[ester]]s of cellulose, which can be obtained from the bark, wood or leaves of plants, or from other plant-based material. In addition to cellulose, the fibers may also contain [[hemicellulose]] and [[lignin]], with different percentages of these components altering the mechanical properties of the fibers.

The main applications of cellulose fibers are in the textile industry, as chemical filters, and as fiber-reinforcement composites, due to their similar properties to engineered fibers, being another option for biocomposites and polymer composites.

The market for cellulose fibers has witnessed strong growth due to increasing demand from the textile industry. The demand for environmentally friendly, skin friendly and [[biodegradation|bio-degradable]] [[fabric]]s is a key factor driving this market.&lt;ref name="Cellulose fibers market"&gt;[http://www.hexaresearch.com/research-report/cellulose-fibers-industry/ Cellulose Fibers Market Analysis and Growth Forecasts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cellulose was discovered in 1838 by the French chemist [[Anselme Payen]], who isolated it from plant matter and determined its chemical formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/187314758|title=Cellulose : molecular and structural biology : selected articles on the synthesis, structure, and applications of cellulose|date=2007|publisher=Springer|others=Brown, R. Malcolm (Richard Malcolm), 1939-, Saxena, I. M. (Inder M.)|isbn=9781402053801|location=Dordrecht|oclc=187314758}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulose was used to produce the first successful thermoplastic polymer, celluloid, by Hyatt Manufacturing Company in 1870. Production of rayon ("artificial silk") from cellulose began in the 1890s, and cellophane was invented in 1912. In 1893, Arthur D. Little of Boston, invented yet another cellulosic product, acetate, and developed it as a film. The first commercial textile uses for acetate in fiber form were developed by the [[Celanese]] Company in 1924. [[Hermann Staudinger]] determined the polymer structure of cellulose in 1920. The compound was first chemically synthesized (without the use of any biologically derived enzymes) in 1992, by Kobayashi and Shoda.

[[File:Cellulose strand.svg|thumb|Cellulose chains linked by hydrogen bonds]]

==Cellulose structure==
Cellulose is a polymer made of repeating glucose molecules attached end to end.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} A cellulose molecule may be from several hundred to over 10,000 glucose units long. Cellulose is similar in form to complex carbohydrates like starch and glycogen. These polysaccharides are also made from multiple subunits of glucose. The difference between cellulose and other complex carbohydrate molecules is how the glucose molecules are linked together. In addition, cellulose is a straight chain polymer, and each cellulose molecule is long and rod-like. This differs from starch, which is a coiled molecule. A result of these differences in structure is that, compared to starch and other carbohydrates, cellulose cannot be broken down into its glucose subunits by any enzymes produced by animals.

==Types==

===Natural cellulose fibers===
Natural cellulose fibers are fibers that are still recognizable as being from a part of the original plant because they are only processed as much as needed to clean the fibers for use.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} For example, [[cotton]] fibers look like the soft fluffy cotton balls that they come from. [[Linen]] fibers look like the strong fibrous strands of the [[flax]] plant. All "natural" fibers go through a process where they are separated from the parts of the plant that are not used for the end product, usually through [[harvesting]], separating from [[chaff]], [[Wool#Scouring|scouring]], etc. The presence of linear chains of thousands of glucose units linked together allows a great deal of hydrogen bonding between OH groups on adjacent chains, causing them to pack closely into cellulose fibers. As a result, cellulose exhibits little interaction with water or any other solvent. Cotton and wood, for example, are completely insoluble in water and have considerable mechanical strength. Since cellulose does not have a helical structure like amylose, it does not bind to iodine to form a colored product.

===Manufactured cellulose fibers===
Manufactured cellulose fibers come from plants that are processed into a [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] and then extruded in the same ways that synthetic fibers like [[polyester]] or [[nylon]] are made. [[Rayon]] or [[viscose]] is one of the most common "manufactured" cellulose fibers, and it can be made from wood pulp.

==Structure and properties==

Natural fibers are composed by microfibrils of cellulose in a matrix of hemicellulose and lignin. This type of structure and the chemical composition of them is responsible for the mechanical properties that can be observed. Because the natural fibers make hydrogen bonds between the long chains, they have the necessary stiffness and strength.

===Chemical composition===

The major constituents of natural fibers ([[lignocellulose]]s) are cellulose, [[hemicellulose]], [[lignin]], [[pectin]] and [[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]. The percentage of each component varies for each different type of fiber, however, generally, are around 60-80% cellulose, 5–20% lignin, and 20% of moisture, besides hemicellulose and a small percent of residual chemical components. The properties of the fiber change depending on the amount of each component, since the hemicellulose is responsible for the moisture absorption, bio- and thermal degradation whereas lignin ensures thermal stability but is responsible for the UV degradation. The chemical composition of commons natural fibers are shown below,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xue | first1 = L. G. | last2 = Tabil | first2 = L. | last3 = Panigrahi | first3 = S. |doi= 10.1007/s10924-006-0042-3 |title= Chemical Treatments of Natural Fiber for Use in Natural Fiber-Reinforced Composites: A Review |journal= Journal of Polymers and the Environment |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages= 25–33 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can change if the fibers are a [[bast fiber]] (obtained from the bark), a core fiber (obtained from the wood), or a leaf fiber (obtained from the leaves).

[[Composite material]]s are a class of material most often made by the combination of a matrix and a fiber. This combination mixes the properties of the matrix and the fiber to create a new material that may be stronger than the fiber alone. Recently, cellulose fibers have begun to be used as a fiber-reinforcement material, especially in conjunction with polymers (as can be observed in the table&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saheb | first1 = D. N. | last2 = Jog | first2 = J. P. |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2329(199924)18:4 |title= Natural fiber polymer composites: A review |journal=Advances in Polymer Technology |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=351–363 |year=1991 | doi-broken-date = 2018-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), in [[biocomposite]]s and [[fiber-reinforced plastic]]. The macroscopic characteristics of fibers can influence the behavior of the resulting composites. Of interest are the following physical and mechanical properties of cellulosic fibers:

*'''Dimensions''': The relationship between the length and diameter of the fibers is a determining factor in the transfer of efforts to the matrix. Another interesting point is the irregular cross-section of plant fibers as well as their fibrillated appearance, which can exert a positive influence on the anchoring of the fibers with the fragile matrix.
*'''Void volume and water absorption''': Because of the large volume of permeable voids within the material, absorption is very high within the first moments of immersion. As a direct consequence, comes negative interference in relation to water, such as the binder matrix swelling and subsequent shrinkage of the fiber. On the other hand, the high void volume contributes to reduced weight, increased acoustic absorption and low thermal conductivity the obtained components.
*'''Tensile strength''': Similar, on average, to the polypropylene’s fibers.
*'''Elastic modulus''': Cellulosic fibers are classified as low modulus determining the factor for its use in building components working in post-cracked stage, with high energy absorption and resistance to dynamic forces.

===Textile===
In the textile industry [[regenerated cellulose]] is used as [[fiber]]s such as [[rayon]], (including [[modal (textile)|modal]], and the more recently developed [[Lyocell]]). Cellulose fibers are manufactured from [[dissolving pulp]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/186246363|title=Sustainable fashion and textiles design journeys|last=1971-|first=Fletcher, Kate,|date=2008|publisher=Earthscan|isbn=9781849772778|location=London|oclc=186246363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulose-based fibers are of two types, regenerated or pure cellulose such as from the cupro-ammonium process and modified cellulose such as the [[cellulose acetate]]s.

The first artificial fiber, known as [[artificial silk]], became known as [[viscose]] around 1894, and finally [[rayon]] in 1924. A similar product known as [[cellulose acetate]] was discovered in 1865. Rayon and acetate are both artificial fibers, but not truly synthetic, being made from [[wood]]. Although these artificial fibers were discovered in the mid-nineteenth century, successful modern manufacture began much later.

===Filtration===
The cellulose fibers infiltration/filter aid applications can provide a protective layer to filter elements as powdered cellulose, besides promoting improved throughput and clarity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} As ashless and non-abrasive filtration, make cleanup effortless after the filtering process without damage in pumps or valves. They effectively filter metallic impurities and absorb up to 100% of emulsified oil and boiler condensates. In general, cellulose fibers in filtration applications can greatly improve filtration performance when used as a primary or remedial precoat in the following ways: 

* Bridging gaps in the filter septum and small mechanical leaks in the gaskets and leaf seats 
* Improving the stability of the filter-aid cake to make it more resistant to pressure bumps and interruptions 
* Creating a more uniform precoat with no cracks for more effective filtration surface area 
* Improving cake release and reducing cleaning requirements 
* Preventing fine particulate bleed-through 
* Precoating easily and rapidly and reducing soluble contamination

== Comparison with other fibers ==

In comparison with engineered fibers, cellulose fibers have important advantages as low density, low cost, they can be recyclable, and are biodegradable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mohanty | first1 = A. K. | last2 = Misra | first2 = M. | last3 = Hinrichsen | first3 = G. |doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1439-2054(20000301)276:1&lt;1::AID-MAME1&gt;3.0.CO;2-W |title= Biofibres, biodegradable polymers and biocomposites: An overview |journal= Macromolecular Materials and Engineering |volume=276-277 |issue=1 |pages=1–24 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its advantages cellulose fibers can be used as a substituent for glass fibers in composites materials.

== Environmental issues ==

What is often marketed as [[Bamboo textiles#Bamboo fibre|"bamboo fiber"]] is actually not the fibers that grow in their natural form from the [[bamboo]] plants, but instead a highly processed bamboo pulp that is extruded as fibers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the process is not as [[environmentally friendly]] as "bamboo fiber" appears, planting &amp; harvesting bamboo for fiber is much more sustainable and environmentally friendly than harvesting more slow growing trees and clearing existing forest habitats for timber plantations.

'''David Nelson''' (died 20 July 1789) was gardener-botanist on the [[Third voyage of James Cook|third voyage]] of [[James Cook]], and [[botanist]] on {{HMS|Bounty}} under [[William Bligh]] at the time of the famous [[mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny]].

Nothing is known of his ancestry or early life. In 1776, while working as a gardener at [[Kew Gardens]], he accepted a position as a servant to [[William Bayly (astronomer)|William Bayly]], the official astronomer on {{HMS|Resolution|1771|6}}. He was promoted to able seaman; however, his real task as arranged between [[Joseph Banks]] and Cook was to collect as many botanical specimens as possible for the Royal Gardens,&lt;ref name=Quanchi&gt;{{cite book | last = Quanchi | first = Max|authorlink=| year = 2005 | title = Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands | publisher = The Scarecrow Press  | location =  |page=192| isbn = 0810853957}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Cook, who had failed to attract an established botanist to the position.  He received a small amount of botanical training and instruction from Banks and [[William Aiton]] before embarking. During the voyage, he also made a significant collection of native Hawaiian birds, which is now housed in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name= Quanchi/&gt;

On returning to [[London]] in 1780, he worked as a gardener at Kew Gardens for seven years, before Banks arranged his appointment as botanist to Bligh's voyage to [[Tahiti]] to obtain [[breadfruit]] trees.&lt;ref name= Quanchi/&gt; Nelson had control of the Great Cabin and 1015 potted breadfruit trees which were intended for the [[West Indies]]. He was caught up in the mutiny and, remaining loyal to the captain, was one of the 19 men cast adrift  in a small boat. He survived the famous 3800-mile voyage to [[Timor]], but a few days after arriving in [[Kupang]], died of a fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = St. John, Harold | title = Biography of David Nelson, and an account of his botanizing in Hawaii | journal = Pacific Science | year = 1976 | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | hdl = 10125/1529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bligh would later name [[Mount Nelson, Tasmania]] in his honor.

A '''drainage basin''' is any area of land where [[precipitation]] collects and drains off into a common outlet, such as into a [[river]], [[bay]], or other [[body of water]]. The drainage basin includes all the [[surface water]] from [[surface runoff|rain runoff]], [[snowmelt]], and nearby streams that run downslope towards the shared outlet, as well as the [[groundwater]] underneath the earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/glossary/a_d/drainage_basin.html |title=drainage basin |work=The Physical Environment |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040321033433/http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/glossary/a_d/drainage_basin.html|archivedate=March 21, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drainage basins connect into other drainage basins at lower elevations in a [[Strahler number|hierarchical pattern]], with smaller '''sub-drainage basins''', which in turn drain into another common outlet.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;{{cite web |author= |year= |url=http://www.wr.udel.edu/cb/whatwhycare.html |title=What is a watershed and why should I care? |publisher=university of delaware |accessdate=2008-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms used interchangeably with ''drainage basin'' are '''catchment area''', '''catchment basin''', '''drainage area''', '''river basin''', and '''water basin'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=David|authorlink=|title=The Field Guide to Geology|publisher=Checkmark Books|series=|year=1998| pages=130–13|doi=|isbn=0-8160-3823-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North America]], the term '''''watershed''''' is commonly used to mean a drainage basin, though in other English-speaking countries, it is used only in its original sense, that of a [[drainage divide]].

In a closed drainage basin, or [[endorheic basin]], the water converges to a single point inside the basin, known as a [[sink (geography)|sink]], which may be a permanent lake, a [[dry lake]], or a point where surface water is [[Losing stream|lost underground]].&lt;ref name=virginia&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/stormwater_management/hu.shtml |title= Hydrologic Unit Geography |publisher= Virginia Department of Conservation &amp; Recreation |accessdate= 21 November 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20121214100316/http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/stormwater_management/hu.shtml |archivedate= 14 December 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The drainage basin acts as a [[funnel]] by collecting all the water within the area covered by the basin and channelling it to a single point. Each drainage basin is separated topographically from adjacent basins by a perimeter, the [[drainage divide]], making up a succession of higher geographical features (such as a [[ridge]], [[hill]] or [[mountain]]s) forming a barrier.

Drainage basins are similar but not identical to [[Hydrological code|hydrologic units]], which are drainage areas delineated so as to nest into a multi-level hierarchical [[drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage system]]. Hydrologic units are defined to allow multiple inlets, outlets, or sinks. In a strict sense, all drainage basins are hydrologic units but not all hydrologic units are drainage basins.&lt;ref name=virginia/&gt;

== Major drainage basins of the world ==
{{See also|List of drainage basins by area}}

=== Map ===
[[File:Ocean drainage.png|frameless|center|upright=3.1|Major [[continental divide]]s, showing drainage into the major oceans and seas of the world.]]
&lt;center&gt;Drainage basins of the principal oceans and seas of the world. Grey areas are [[endorheic basin]]s that do not drain to the oceans.&lt;/center&gt;

=== Ocean basins ===
The following is a list of the major ocean basins:
* About 48.7% of the world's land drains to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].{{fact|date=January 2017}} In [[North America]], surface water drains to the Atlantic via the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and [[Great Lakes]] basins, the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] of the United States, the [[Maritimes|Canadian Maritimes]], and most of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. Nearly all of [[South America]] east of the [[Andes]] also drains to the Atlantic, as does most of [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] and the greatest portion of western [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], as well as [[Western Sahara]] and part of [[Morocco]]. The two major [[Mediterranean sea (oceanography)|mediterranean seas]] of the world also flow to the Atlantic:
** The [[Caribbean Sea]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]] basin includes most of the U.S. interior between the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] and [[Rocky Mountains]], a small part of the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]], eastern [[Central America]], the islands of the Caribbean and the Gulf, and a small part of northern South America.
** The [[Mediterranean Sea]] basin includes much of [[North Africa]], east-central [[Africa]] (through the [[Nile River]]), [[Southern Europe|Southern]], Central, and [[Eastern Europe]], [[Turkey]], and the coastal areas of [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Syria]].
* The [[Arctic Ocean]] drains most of [[Western Canada|Western]] and [[Northern Canada]] east of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], northern [[Alaska]] and parts of [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Montana]] in the United States, the north shore of the [[Scandinavian peninsula]] in Europe, central and northern Russia, and parts of [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]] in [[Asia]], which totals to about 17% of the world's land.&lt;!-- Roughly (+/-0,7% error), computed. --~~~~ --&gt; 
* Just over 13% of the land in the world drains to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Its basin includes much of China, eastern and southeastern Russia, Japan, the [[Korean Peninsula]], most of Indochina, Indonesia and Malaysia, the Philippines, all of the [[Pacific Islands]], the northeast coast of [[Australia]], and Canada and the United States west of the Continental Divide (including most of Alaska), as well as western Central America and South America west of the Andes.
* The [[Indian Ocean]]'s drainage basin also comprises about 13% of Earth's land. It drains the eastern coast of Africa, the coasts of the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], Burma, and most of Australia.
* The [[Southern Ocean]] drains [[Antarctica]]. Antarctica comprises approximately eight percent of the Earth's land.

=== Largest river basins ===
{{See also|List of drainage basins by area}}
The five largest river basins (by area), from largest to smallest, are the basins of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] (7M km{{sup|2}}), the [[Congo River|Congo]] (4M km{{sup|2}}), the [[Nile River|Nile]] (3.4M km{{sup|2}}), the [[Río de la Plata]] (3.2M km{{sup|2}}), and the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] (3M km{{sup|2}}). The three rivers that drain the most water, from most to least, are the Amazon, [[Ganga River|Ganga]], and Congo rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta Encyclopedia articles on [[Amazon River]], [[Congo River]], and [[Ganges]] Published by Microsoft in computers.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endorheic drainage basins ===
[[File:Uureg Nuur.jpg|thumb|[[Endorheic basin]] in [[Central Asia]]]]
{{Main article|Endorheic basin}}
[[Endorheic basin|Endorheic drainage basins]] are inland basins that do not drain to an ocean. Around 18% of all land drains to endorheic lakes or seas or sinks. The largest of these consists of much of the interior of [[Asia]], which drains into the [[Caspian Sea]], the [[Aral Sea]], and numerous smaller lakes. Other endorheic regions include the [[Great Basin]] in the United States, much of the [[Sahara Desert]], the drainage basin of the [[Okavango River]] ([[Kalahari Basin]]), highlands near the [[African Great Lakes]], the interiors of [[Australia]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and parts in [[Mexico]] and the [[Andes]]. Some of these, such as the Great Basin, are not single drainage basins but collections of separate, adjacent closed basins.

In endorheic [[Bodies of water|bodies of standing water]] where evaporation is the primary means of water loss, the water is typically more saline than the oceans. An extreme example of this is the [[Dead Sea]].

== Importance of drainage basins ==

=== Geopolitical boundaries ===
Drainage basins have been historically important for determining territorial boundaries, particularly in regions where trade by water has been important. For example, the [[England|English]] crown gave the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] a monopoly on the [[fur trade]] in the entire [[Hudson Bay]] basin, an area called [[Rupert's Land]]. [[bioregionalism|Bioregional]] political organization today includes agreements of states (e.g., international [[treaty|treaties]] and, within the U.S.A., [[interstate compact]]s) or other political entities in a particular drainage basin to manage the body or bodies of water into which it drains. Examples of such interstate compacts are the [[Great Lakes Commission]] and the [[Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]].

=== Hydrology ===
[[File:Ohiorivermap.png|thumb|right|Drainage basin of the [[Ohio River]], part of the [[Mississippi River]] drainage basin]]

In [[hydrology]], the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the [[hydrological cycle]], because the majority of water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falling on the basin. A portion of the water that enters the [[groundwater]] system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network. Measurement of the discharge of water from a basin may be made by a [[stream gauge]] located at the basin's outlet.

Rain gauge data is used to measure total precipitation over a drainage basin, and there are different ways to interpret that data. If the gauges are many and evenly distributed over an area of uniform precipitation, using the [[arithmetic mean]] method will give good results. In the [[Thiessen polygon]] method, the drainage basin is divided into polygons with the rain gauge in the middle of each polygon assumed to be representative for the rainfall on the area of land included in its polygon. These polygons are made by drawing lines between gauges, then making perpendicular bisectors of those lines form the polygons. The [[isohyet]]al method involves contours of equal precipitation are drawn over the gauges on a map. Calculating the area between these curves and adding up the volume of water is time consuming.

[[Isochrone map]]s can be used to show the time taken for runoff water within a drainage basin to reach a lake, reservoir or outlet, assuming constant and uniform effective rainfall.&lt;ref name="hydrolearthsystsci bell 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/2/265/1998/hess-2-265-1998.pdf | title=A grid-based distributed flood forecasting model for use with weather radar data: Part 1.

=== Geomorphology ===
Drainage basins are the principal hydrologic unit considered in [[fluvial]] [[geomorphology]]. A drainage basin is the source for water and [[sediment]] that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms.

=== Ecology ===
[[File:Mississippi River basin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Mississippi River]] drains the largest area of any [[United States|U.S.]] river, much of it [[agriculture|agricultural]] regions. Agricultural runoff and other water pollution that flows to the outlet is the cause of the [[dead zone (ecology)|hypoxic, or dead zone]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].]]

Drainage basins are important in [[ecology]]. As water flows over the ground and along rivers it can pick up nutrients, sediment, and [[water pollution|pollutants]]. With the water, they are transported towards the outlet of the basin, and can affect the ecological processes along the way as well as in the receiving water source.

Modern use of artificial fertilizers, containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, has affected the mouths of drainage basins. The minerals are carried by the drainage basin to the mouth, and may accumulate there, disturbing the natural mineral balance. This can cause [[eutrophication]] where plant growth is accelerated by the additional material.

=== Resource management ===
{{further information|Watershed management}}
Because drainage basins are coherent entities in a hydro-logical sense, it has become common to manage water resources on the basis of individual basins. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]], governmental entities that perform this function are called "[[Watershed district (Minnesota)|watershed district]]s". In New Zealand, they are called catchment boards. Comparable community groups based in Ontario, Canada, are called [[Conservation authority (Canada)|conservation authorities]]. In North America, this function is referred to as "[[watershed management]]".
In [[Brazil]], the National Policy of Water Resources, regulated by Act n° 9.433 of 1997, establishes the drainage basin as the territorial division of Brazilian water management.

When a river basin crosses at least one political border, either a border within a nation or an international boundary, it is identified as a [[transboundary river]]. Management of such basins becomes the responsibility of the countries sharing it. [[Nile Basin Initiative]], [[OMVS]] for [[Senegal River]], [[Mekong River Commission]] are a few examples of arrangements involving management of shared river basins.

Management of shared drainage basins is also seen as a way to build lasting peaceful relationships among countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/inner-articles.php?id=310#.WA9Ia-V97GI|title=Articles|website=www.strategicforesight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catchment factors ==
The catchment is the most significant factor determining the amount or likelihood of [[flooding]].

Catchment factors are: [[topography]], shape, size, [[soil]] type, and [[land use]] (paved or [[roof]]ed areas). Catchment topography and shape determine the time taken for [[rain]] to reach the river, while catchment size, soil type, and development determine the amount of water to reach the river.

=== Topography ===
Generally, topography plays a big part in how fast runoff will reach a river. Rain that falls in steep [[mountain]]ous areas will reach the primary river in the drainage basin faster than flat or lightly sloping areas (e.g., &gt; 1% gradient).

=== Shape ===
Shape will contribute to the speed with which the runoff reaches a river. A long thin catchment will take longer to drain than a circular catchment.

=== Size ===
Size will help determine the amount of water reaching the river, as the larger the catchment the greater the potential for flooding. It is also determined on the basis of length and width of the drainage basin.

=== Soil type ===
Soil type will help determine how much water reaches the river. Certain soil types such as [[sand]]y soils are very free-draining, and rainfall on sandy soil is likely to be absorbed by the ground. However, soils containing [[clay]] can be almost impermeable and therefore rainfall on clay soils will run off and contribute to flood volumes. After prolonged rainfall even free-draining soils can become [[wikt:saturated|saturated]], meaning that any further rainfall will reach the river rather than being absorbed by the ground. If the surface is impermeable the precipitation will create surface run-off which will lead to higher risk of flooding; if the ground is permeable, the precipitation will infiltrate the soil.

=== Land use ===
Land use can contribute to the volume of water reaching the river, in a similar way to clay soils. For example, rainfall on roofs, [[sidewalk|pavements]], and [[road]]s will be collected by rivers with almost no absorption into the [[groundwater]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3728">'''Environmental quality''' is a set of properties and characteristics of the environment, either generalized or local, as they impinge on human beings and other organisms. It is a measure of the condition of an environment relative to the requirements of one or more species and or to any human need or purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D.L., S.H. Ambrose, T.J. Bassett, M.L. Bowen, D.E. Crummey, J.S. Isaacson, D.N. Johnson, P. Lamb, M. Saul, and A.E. Winter-Nelson (1997). "Meanings of environmental terms." ''Journal of Environmental Quality.'' 26: 581–89. {{doi|10.2134/jeq1997.00472425002600030002x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental quality includes the [[natural environment]] as well as the [[built environment]], such as [[air quality|air]] and [[water quality|water purity]] or [[pollution]], [[noise]] and the potential effects which such characteristics may have on physical and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;European Environment Agency, Copenhagen, Denmark. [http://glossary.eea.europa.eu/EEAGlossary/E/environmental_quality "Environmental Quality (definition)."] ''Glossary.'' Environmental Terminology and Discovery Service. Accessed 2012-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, the term is applied with a body of federal and state [[regulation|standards and regulations]] that are monitored by regulatory agencies.  All states in the U.S. have some form of a department or commission that is responsible for a variety of activities such as monitoring quality, responding to citizen complaints, and enforcing environmental regulations.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. (2012). [http://www.epa.gov/epahome/state.htm "State and Territorial Environment Agencies."]&lt;/ref&gt;  The agency with the lead implementation responsibility for most major federal environmental laws (e.g. [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], [[Clean Water Act]]) is the US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2012). [http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/ "Laws &amp; Regulations."]&lt;/ref&gt; Other federal agencies with significant oversight roles include the  [[Council on Environmental Quality]], [[United States Department of Interior|Department of the Interior]] and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers#Environmental enforcement|Army Corps of Engineers]].

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the environment has been the primary responsibility of the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA). Predecessor bodies were merged in 2001 to create this department with a broader remit to link rural activities to the natural environment. Some responsibilities are devolved to the [[Scottish Government]] and are exercised by the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] (SEPA) and the [[National Assembly for Wales]], while delivery of environmental initiatives often use partners, including: [[British Waterways]], [[Environment Agency]], [[Forestry Commission]], and [[Natural England]]. DEFRA also has a remit to oversee impacts of activities within the built environment and the [[United Kingdom Climate Change Programme]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23095">"Environmental standards are legal and administrative regulations or civil-law rules, which help to transform yet undetermined legal concept of environmental protection into definite norms via [[operationalization]] and [[standardization]] of measurable quantities. Reaching environmental standards is a complex process, which takes into account scientific insights of different disciplines, normative beliefs and values, and the general social context."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Standards: Scientific Foundations and Rational Procedures of Radiological Risk Management|last=Pinkau|first=K.|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media B.V.|year=1998|isbn=978-1-4419-5027-7|location=|pages=XVII–XXXIII, 1–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different environmental activities have different concerns and therefore different standards.

The considered definition of environment is the human environment as distinguished form the [[natural environment]]. The human environment considers that humans are permanently interlinked with surroundings, which are not just the natural elements as air, water and soil, but also culture, communication, cooperations and institutions. The humans live together in an anthropology distinct community. By setting environmental standards the nature should be protect against further damages and preserve of already existing damages, caused by the human way of living.

Environmental standards were set within legal, administrative or private context.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Development of an Environmental Standard ==
When environmental standards were discussed two main driving forces, rooted at every human being, are influencing the development process. On the one hand the radical [[ecocentrism]] of human beings and on the other side a moderate [[anthropocentrism]]. These contrary forces lead to problems in establishing standards, but the idea of shaping the world and preserve it for future generations is the leading keynote. Within the last years the sensibility of people towards the topic of environmental issues is increasing consequently thereof the demand of environmental protections has risen. This movement is caused by the development in science and medical knowledge as well as the improvement of measurement systems. With these improvements the knowledge about the impact of human way of living towards the environment, human and animal health is explored. The development in science is fundamental for the setting of the environmental standards within the last years.

Environmental standards often define a desired state (e.g. lake pH should be between 6.5 and 7.5) or limit alterations (e.g. no more than 50% of natural forest may be damaged). To belong to a specific state or limit, which should define the standard, most likely statistical methods were used.

Concerning environmental issues uncertainties must always be considered. The first step to develop a standard is the evaluation of the specific risk. The expected value of the occurrence of the risk must be calculated. Than the possible damage should be classified. Three different types of damages were distinguished: changes due to physical-chemical environmental damages, ecological damages in plants and animals and damages done to human health. To establish an acceptable risk, in view of the expected collective benefit, the risk-induced costs and the costs of risk avoidance must be social balanced. The comparison is difficult to express in monetary units. Furthermore the risks have multiple dimensions, which should reached a correlation at the end of the balance process. At the balancing process the following steps should be considered:

# To establish objectives serving both the protection of life, health and environment and allowing for a rational allocation of social resources
# Studying the possible outcomes of the implementing these objectives
# Considering social costs or damages, including opportunity costs and benefits which will arise when any of the available options are not further pursued.

Into the balancing process the fairness of distributing the risks and the resilience (benefits) with respect to sustaining the productivity of the environment should be observed too. In addition to the standard, an implementation rule, indicating under what circumstances the standard will be considered violated, is commonly part of the regulations. Penalties and other procedures for dealing with regions out of compliance with the standard may be part of the legislation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Setting Environmental Standards: The Statistical Approach to Handling uncertainty and variation|last=Barnett|first=V.|publisher=Chapman and Hall|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=1–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guttorp|first=Peter|date=December 2006|title=Setting environmental standards: A statistician's perspective|url=|journal=Environmental Geosciences|volume=13/4|pages=261–266|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Institution setting Environmental Standards ==
Environmental standards were set by different institutions. Most of the standards were based on the principle of voluntary self-commitment.

=== Governmental Institutions ===

==== UN ====
With 193 member states the largest [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental organisation]], the environmental policy of the [[United Nations|UN]] has a huge impact for the setting of international environmental standards. At the [[Earth Summit|Earth submit]] 1992 in Rio the member states acknowledged their negative impact towards the environment for the first time. During this and the following [[United Nations Millennium Declaration|Millennium Declaration]] the first development goals for environmental issues were set. Since then the risk of catastrophic caused by extreme acts of God has enhanced, by overuse of [[Natural resource|natural resources]] and the [[global warming]]. At the [[Paris Agreement]] 2015 the UN determined [[Sustainable Development Goals|17 Goals]] for a sustainable development. Besides the fight against global poverty the main focus of the goals is the preservation of our planet. These goals set a basement for global [[environmentalism]]. The environmental areas of water, energy, oceans, [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]], sustainable production and consume behaviour and climate protection were covered by the goals. The goals contain explanations which mediums where required to reach them.

Questionable is the follow-up and inspection, whether the member states fulfil the settled goals, because some members perceive inspection, or any other control form any external parties as an intervention into their inner affairs. Caused by this the implementation and follow-up are only controlled by the Voluntary National Reviews. The main control is done by statistical values, which are called indicators. These indicators deliver information, if the goals are reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martens|first=Jens|date=2017|title=Die Agenda 2030 Globale Zukunftsziele für nachhaltige Entwicklung|url=|journal=Global Policy Forum|volume=|pages=7-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://committee.iso.org/sites/tc207sc1/home/projects/ongoing/supporting-environmental-and-bus/un-sustainable-development-goals.html|title=UN Sustainable Development Goals - can ISO standards help?

==== European Union ====
Within the “[[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]“ the Union integrate a self-commitment towards the environment. In Title XX, Article 191.1 it is settled: “Union policy on the environment shall contribute to pursuit of the following objectives: — preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment, — protecting human health, — prudent and rational utilization of natural resources, — promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental; problems, and in particular combating climate change.” All environmental actions are based on this article and lead to a lot of [[Environmental law|environmental laws]]. The European Union covers the topics: air, [[Biotechnology|biotechnologies]], chemical, civil protection, climate change, environmental economics, health, industry and technology, internationals, land use, nature and [[biodiversity]], noise, protection of the [[Ozone layer|ozonosphere]], soil, sustainable development, waste and water.

Furthermore the [[European Environment Agency|European Environment Agency (EEA)]] with consults the members states about environmental issues, including standards. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Ausarbeitung Zu Umweltstandards in Kanada, den USA und der EU|url=|journal=Der Deutsche Bundestag|volume=2016|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dejure.org/gesetze/AEUV/191.html|title=Vertrag über die Arbeitsweise der Europäischen Union|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/1341/1342/html/index.de.html|title=Vertrag über die Europäische Union und Vertrag über die Arbeitsweise der Europäischen Union|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/gesellschaft/umwelt/dossier-umwelt/61179/eu-umweltpolitik?p=0|title=Internationale und Europäische Umweltpolitik|last=Steigenberger|first=Markus|date=2009-03-30|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nation-states – Example USA ====
In the United States of America the development of standards is [[Decentralization|decentralised]]. The standards were developed by more than hundred different institutions, a lot of them are private ones. It is a plural system, which is mainly affected by the market and partly fragmentated. In the following you find two concrete examples:Standards in the United States
=====Ambient Standards=====

The ambient standards, also known as the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS), is set by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to regulate how many pollutants are in the air. As part of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] initiative, ambient standards are set to ensure that people are breathing clean air. Furthermore, these regulation help preserve public welfare from any known pollutants that could potentially damage it. Furthermore, the enforcement of these set standards are designed to prevent further degradation of air quality. States may set their own ambient standards but must be lower than the national one in order to be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/50.2|title=40 CFR 50.2 - Scope.|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NAAQS regulates the six criteria air pollutants: [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Particulate matter#Health effects|particulate matter]] (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[lead]] (Pb).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/part-50|title=40 CFR Part 50 - NATIONAL PRIMARY AND SECONDARY AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that the ambient standards are met, the EPA uses the Federal Reference Method (FRM) and Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) systems measure the amount of pollutants in the air are within the limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=321491|title=Reference and Equivalent Methods Used to Measure National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) Criteria Air Pollutants - Volume I|last=&amp;Development|first=Office of Research|website=cfpub.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Emission Standards=====

Emission standards are national regulations, managed by the EPA, that control the amount of pollutants that can be released into atmosphere. These standards are put into place in order to maintain air quality and human health and regulate the release of [[greenhouse gas]]es, such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[oxides of nitrogen]] and [[Lower sulfur oxides|oxides of sulfur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120153824/http://www.emissions.org/publications/member_articles/ef9ema.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=2008-11-20|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The standards set are established in two phases to stay up to date, with final projections aiming to collectively save Americans $1.7 trillion in fuel costs and reduce the amount of [[greenhouse gas emissions]] (GHG) by 6 billion metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/regulations-greenhouse-gas-emissions-passenger-cars-and|title=Regulations for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Passenger Cars and Trucks {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OAR,OTAQ|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the ambient standards, individuals states may also tighten regulations to their liking. For example, California set their own emissions standards through the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB), whose numbers were beginning to be adopted by other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/fuel-economy/carb4.htm|title=How the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Works|date=2008-09-12|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emission standards also regulate the amount of pollutants released by heavy industry and for electricity.

The technological standards set by the EPA do not necessarily enforce the usage of specific technologies, but sets a minimum performance levels for different industries. Furthermore, these regulations allows data collection to be more precise, allowing for the standards set based off those information to be feasible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/setting-emissions-standards-based-technology-performance|title=Setting Emissions Standards Based on Technology Performance {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OAR|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA often encourage technological improvement by setting standards that are unachievable with current technologies. These standards are always set based on the industry's top performers to promote the overall improvement of the industry as a whole.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Impact of Non-governmental organization ===

==== International Organization of Standardization ====
The [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization of Standardization]] is the institution, which develops a large number of voluntary standards. With 163 member states it has a comprehensive outreach which their standards. The standards set by the ISO were often transmitted into national standards by different nations. About 363.000 companies and organisations worldwide have the [[ISO 14000|ISO 14001 certificate]], a standard for an environmental management, created to improve the environmental performance of an organisation and legal aspects as well as reaching environmental aims. Most of the national and international environmental management standards, including the ISO 14000 series. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rondinelli|first=Dennis A.|date=Fall 1996|title=International Environmental Standards and Corporate Policies: An Integrative Framework|url=|journal=California Management Review|volume=39|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/wirtschaft-konsum/wirtschaft-umwelt/umwelt-energiemanagement/iso-14001-umweltmanagementsystemnorm|title=ISO 14001 - Umweltmanagementsystemnorm|last=|first=|date=2018-11-07|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Greenpeace ====
[[Greenpeace]] is one of the best known [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisation]], which deals with biodiversity and environment. With their activities they have a great global impact on environmental issues. By activities recording special environmental issues they encourage the public attention and enforce governances or companies to adapt / set environmental standards. Their main focus is on forests, the sea, climate change and toxic chemicals. For example, referring to the toxic chemicals they set a standard together with the textile sector. They created the concept 2020, which has the idea to banish all toxic chemicals out of the textile production until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/greenpeace-international|title=Greenpeace International|last=Fricke|first=Kristin Lorey|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/biodiversity|title=Biodiversity|last=Reimer|first=Brea|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== WWF ====
The WWF focus on how to produce the maximum yield in agriculture while conserving biodiversity. They try to educate, protect, reach policy changes and incentives to reach they aim. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.relaio.de/topics/artikeluebersicht/umweltstandards.html|title=Umweltstandards|last=Deidenbach|first=Caroline|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economy ===
Environmental standards in the economy are set through external motivation. First of all companies need to fulfill the environmental law of the countries, in which they are operating. Moreover environmental standards were based on voluntary self-commitment, which means companies implement standards for their business, which exceed the level of the requirements of governmental regulations. If companies set further-reaching standards they try to fulfill the wishes of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. At the process of setting environmental standards three different stakeholders have the main influence. The first stakeholder, the government, is already mentioned and it is strongest determinate. Followed by the influence of the customers. Nowadays there is an increasing amount of people, wo consider environmental factor to their purchasing decision. The third stakeholder, who force companies to set environmental standards are industrial participants. If companies are part of industrial networks they are forced to fulfill the [[Code of conduct|codes of conduct]] of this networks. This code of conducts is often set to improve the collective [[reputation]] of an industry. Another driving force of industry participants could be a reaction to a competitors action.

The environmental standards set by companies their self can be divided into two dimensions. First the operational environmental policies. This can be the environmental management, [[Audit|audits]], controls or technologies. In this dimension the regulations tend to be closely connect with other function areas, e.g. [[Lean manufacturing|lean production]]. Furthermore it could be occupied that [[Multinational corporation|multinational companies]] tend to set cross-country harmonised environmental government regulations and reach therefore higher performance level of environmental standards. The second dimension is the message send in [[advertising]] and public communications. It´s often criticized that companies focus on the second dimension. To satisfy the stakeholders requirement companies were focused on the public impression of their environmental self-commitment standards. Often the real implementation doesn´t play an important role. A lot of companies settle the responsibility for the implementation in low budget departments. The workers, which were in charge of the standards missing time and financial resources to guaranty a real implementation. Furthermore within the implementation goal conflicts arising. The biggest concern of companies is that the environmental protect is more expansive compared to the gained beneficial effects. But there are a lot of positive cost-benefit-calculation for environmental standards, set by companies their self. It is observed, that companies often set environmental standards after a public crisis. To the criticised nuisances a higher importance is assigned after the crises, to improve the environmental standards were implement after. Sometimes environmental standards were already set by companies to avoid public crises. If the environmental self-commitment standards are effective is controversial. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christmann|first=Petra|date=2004|title=Multinational Companies and the natural environment: Determinants of global environmental policy standardization|url=|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=Vol. 47, No. 5|pages=747–760|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Ting|date=2016|title=Global environmental standards with heterogeneous polluters|url=|journal=International Review of Economics and Finance|volume=43|pages=482–498|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Müller|first=Martin|date=2014|title=Realität oder Schein Eine qualitative Untersuchung zur Entkopplungsthese bei der Umsetzung von Umwelt- und Sozialstandards in Unternehmen|url=|journal=zfwu|volume=15/1|pages=8-26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Karen|date=Fall 1995|title=Tightening Environmental Standards: The Benefit-Cost or the No-Cost Paradigm?|url=|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=9/4|pages=119–132|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Falls of the Ohio State Park''' is a [[state park]] in [[Indiana]].  It is located on the banks of the [[Ohio River]] at [[Clarksville, Indiana]], across from [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. The park is part of the [[Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area]]. The exposed [[fossil]] beds of the [[Jeffersonville Limestone]] dated from the [[Devonian]] period are the main feature of the park.  The Falls was the site where [[Lewis &amp; Clark]] met for the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/dnr/lewis-clark/falls/ |title=Indiana Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commission |publisher=In.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewisandclarkinkentucky.org/places/falls.shtml |title=Kentucky places : Louisville and the Falls of the Ohio |publisher=Lewis and Clark in Kentucky |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lewis-clark.org/content/content-article.asp?ArticleID=1890 |title=At the Falls of the Ohio |publisher=Lewis-clark.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/lewisandclark/ocs.htm |title=Old Clarksville Site-Lewis and Clark Expedition: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/history/2584.htm |title=IHB: Lewis and Clark-Indiana connections - Focus |publisher=In.gov |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/LC/The%20Mission/Expedition/page_4.htm |title=Part 4: Ohio River - Lewis and Clark - Corps of Discovery - U.S. Army Center of Military History |publisher=History.army.mil |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park includes an [[interpretive center]] open to the public. In 1990 the Indiana state government hired Terry Chase, a well-established exhibit developer, to design the center's displays. Building started in September 1992, costing $4.9 million with a total area of {{convert|16000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Carl. ''This Place We Call Home'' (Indiana University Press, 2007) p.495)&lt;/ref&gt;  The center functions as a museum with exhibits that concentrate on the [[natural history]] related to findings in the nearby fossil beds as well as the human history of the Louisville area, covering pre-settlement, early settlement, and Louisville and [[southern Indiana]] history all the way up through the 20th century.

[[Image:rugose2.jpg|thumb|left|Large [[Rugosa|rugose]] [[coral]] (above hammer) at the Falls of the Ohio.]]
Unlike at other [[List of Indiana state parks|Indiana state parks]], annual entrance permits do not allow unlimited free access (rather, only five people per pass per visit) to the interpretive center, as fees are still needed to reimburse the town of Clarksville for building the center.

The Woodland Loop Trail has ten new stainless steel markers denoting the plant life of the trails, thanks to an Eagle Scout project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsandtribune.com/clarkcounty/x519357779/Scout-project-enhances-Woodland-trail|title=Scout project enhances Woodland trail|work=News and Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strange wildlife has a habit of showing up in the park.  Living [[alligator]]s and [[crocodile]]s have also been seen in the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsandtribune.com/clarkcounty/x519357513/Fisherman-finds-octopus-in-Ohio-River|title=Fisherman finds octopus in Ohio River|work=News and Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2006 a fisherman hooked a dead [[octopus]].  Zachary Treitz, a 21-year-old Louisville college student, admitted he had put the octopus there after purchasing it dead from a local seafood shop for a film project.&lt;ref name="octopus"&gt;{{cite news|first=Grace|last=Schneider|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=list&amp;p_theme=gannett&amp;s_site=courier-journal&amp;p_product=LCJB&amp;p_topdoc=11 |title=Octopus pulled from river was leftover from student's film project|publisher=[[The Courier-Journal]]|accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[merchant vessel]] flies a [[flag]], typically at its stern. This flag indicates the legal jurisdiction to which it is subject. For example, a vessel may fly this flag of the Greece; in this case the authority responsible for enforcing maritime regulations would be the '''Flag Administration''' of Greece.

'''Floating solar''' or '''FPV''' (Floating photovoltaic), refers to an array of solar panels on a structure that floats on a body of water, typically an artificial basin or a lake.

This technology has had a rapid growth on the [[renewable energy]] market since 2016  and in 2017 has overcome  the 200 MW of installed power. The first 20 plants, of a few dozen of kWp have been built between 2008 and 2014 as reported in the [[MIRARCO]] paper &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K. Trapani and M. R. Santafe|first=|date=2014|title=A review of ﬂoating photovoltaic installations 2007–2013|url=|journal=Prog. Photovolt: Res. Appl|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that analyzed the birth of this technology.

The installed power in 2018 is foreseen to be near to 1 GW &lt;ref&gt;[[World Bank Group]], [[ESMAP]], and SERIS. 2018. [http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/579941540407455831/Where-Sun-Meets-Water-Floating-Solar-Market-Report-Executive-Summary Where Sun Meets Water: Floating Solar Market Report - Executive Summary]. Washington, DC: [[World Bank]].&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Technology features ==
There are several reasons for this development:

#''No land occupancy''''':''' the main advantage of floating PV plants is that they do not take up any land, except the limited surfaces necessary for electric cabinet and grid connections. Their price is comparable with land based plants, but they provide a good way to avoid land consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=R. Cazzaniga, M. Rosa-Clot, P. Rosa-Clot and G. M. Tina|first=|date=|year=2018|title=Geographic and Technical Floating Photovoltaic Potential|url=|journal=Thermal Energy Science|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Installation and decommissioning'': floating PV plants are more compact than land-based plants, their management is simpler and their construction and decommissioning straightforward. The main point is that no fixed structures exist like the foundations used for a land-based plant so their installation can be totally reversible.
#''Water saving and water quality:'' the partial coverage of basins can reduce the water evaporation. This result depends on climate conditions and on the percentage of the covered surface. In arid climates such as Australia this is an important advantage since about 80% of the evaporation of the covered surface is saved and this means more than 20,000 m3/year/ha. This is a very useful feature if the basin is used for irrigation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taboada|first=M.E.|last2=Cáceres|first2=L.|last3=Graber|first3=T.A.|last4=Galleguillos|first4=H.R.|last5=Cabeza|first5=L.F.|last6=Rojas|first6=R.|year=2017|title=Solar water heating system and photovoltaic floating cover to reduce evaporation: Experimental results and modeling|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.12.094|journal=Renewable Energy|volume=105|pages=601–615|doi=10.1016/j.renene.2016.12.094|issn=0960-1481|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassan, M.M. and Peyrson W.L.|first=|date=|year=|orig-year=2016|title=Evaporation mitigation by floating modular devices|url=|journal=Earth and environmental science|volume=35|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Cooling:'' the floating structure allows the implementation of a simple cooling system. Cooling mechanism is natural but can also be active by generating a water layer on the PV modules or using a submerged PV modules, the so called SP2 (Submerged Photovoltaic Solar Panel).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choi, Y.K.|first=|date=2014|title=A study on power generation analysis on floating PV system considering environmental impact|url=|journal=Int. Jour. of sw engineering and appl|volume=8|pages=75–84|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases the global PV modules efficiency rises thanks to the absence of thermal drift, with a gain in energy harvesting up to 8-10%.
#''Tracking:'' a large floating platform can be easily turned and can perform a vertical axis tracking: this can be done without wasting energy and without the need for a complex mechanical apparatus as in land-based PV plants. A floating PV plant equipped with a tracking system  has a limited additional cost while the energy gain can range from 15 to 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=R. Cazzaniga, M. Cicu, M. Rosa-Clot, P. Rosa-Clot, G. M. Tina and C. Ventura|first=|date=2018|title=Floating photovoltaic plants: performance analysis and design solutions|url=|journal=Renewable and sustainable reviews|volume=81|pages=1730–1741|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Storage opportunity:'' the presence of water naturally suggests using gravity energy storage mainly in the coupling with hydroelectric basins. However other possibilities has been explored and in particular CAES systems have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=R. Cazzaniga, M. Cicu, M. Rosa-Clot, P. Rosa-Clot, G. M. Tina and C. Ventura|first=|date=2017|title=Compressed air energy storage integrated with floating photovoltaic plant|url=|journal=Journal of Energy Storage|volume=13|pages=48–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Environment control:'' a parallel advantage is the containment of the algae bloom, a serious problem in industrialized countries. The partial coverage of the basins and the reduction of light on biological fouling just below the surface, together with active systems can solve this problem. This is only a part of the more general problem of managing a water basin generated by industrial activities or polluted by them. See for example the mining managing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trapani, K. and Millar, B.|first=|date=2016|title=Floating photovoltaic arrays to power mining industry: a case study for the McFaulds lake (ring of fire)|url=|journal=Sustainable energy|volume=35|pages=898–905|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Efficiency improvement: Many studies claim that there is a significant improvement in efficiency putting solar panels over water. These studies are not conclusive and differ in their conclusion. The energy gain reported range from 5 to 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choi, Y.-K. and N.-H. Lee|first=|date=2013|title=Empirical Research on the efficiency of Floating PV systems compared with Overland PV Systems|url=|journal=Conference proceedings of CES-CUBE|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
American, Danish, French, Italian and Japanese nationals were the first to register [[patent]]s for floating solar. In Italy the first registered patent, regarding  PV modules on water, goes back to February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M. Rosa-Clot and P. Rosa-Clot|first=|date=2008|title=Support and method for increasing the efficiency of solar cells by immersion|url=|journal=Italy Patent PI2008A000088|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[MIRARCO]] (Mining Innovation Rehabilitation and Applied Research Corporation Ontario, CANADA) research group quotes several solutions that were put forward in the years 2008-2011 and 2012-2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Without being exhaustive the installations can be classified into three categories:

* PV plants constituted by modules mounted on pontoons 
* PV modules mounted on rafts built in plastic and galvanized steel 
* PV modules mounted on rafts, fully in plastic.

It is Impossible to give a detailed analysis of the many small PV floating plants built in the first 10 years. The plot here below is based on data taken from the web for FPV with more than 500&amp;nbsp;kW of power. In the Asian Clean Energy Summit in Singapore (Oct. 2017) two number where quoted by the World- Bank Group: 200 MWp for installation in 2017 and  a forecast of 750 MWp for 2018.

[[File:Oberlin Gasholder House Oberlin OH.JPG|thumb|Oberlin Gasholder House, Oberlin, Ohio, USA]]

A '''gasholder house''' is a structure built to surround an iron [[gasholder]] in which gas is stored until it is needed. Before the 1870s, most iron gasholders were constructed without a building structure, but following practices already common in the New England, gasholders houses were adopted in New York. Additionally, gasholder houses were constructed in England as early as 1825, although the mild climate made them less of an advantage.

Gasholder houses were built to protect the iron gas holder from the elements, and enabled it to be built from thinner plates. A gasholder house provided a number of advantages:
* Provides a way to withstand the wind, and the forces on the thinner iron gasholder.
* Avoids snow loads on the top of the holder, and icing of the guides that controlled the vertical movement of the gasholder.
* Prevented the freezing of water in the pit around the gasholder that provides the seal to the gasholder, thus preventing the loss of gas.
* There is also some belief that a gasholder house allayed fears about explosion from the stored gas.

The gasholder house also provides economic advantage by reducing the condensation of gas in cold weather, and provided an attractive architectural element of the gas complex.

There are eleven known gasholder houses in the United States, with the structure in [[Troy, New York]] being one of the largest remaining structures of this type.&lt;ref name="HABS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/NY0672|title=Historic American Engineering Record, Troy Gas Light Company, Gasholder House|accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== HUPX Hungarian Power Exchange Ltd. ==
The Day-ahead Power Market was launched in July 2010 as part of the liberalization of the [[Energy in Hungary|Hungarian energy sector]]. 

== Markets and Products ==

HUPX [[Day trading|Intraday Market]] enables Members to trade 15 minute intraday products on the Hungarian Power Exchange. An organized Intraday Market provides more opportunities for market players to reduce their need for imbalance energy, to optimize [[power generation]] closer in time to delivery and it is also appropriate for managing [[forecast error]]s or unforeseen [[power plant]] outages.

HUPX is also offering physically settled [[futures trading]]. This Market provides weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly baseload/peakload contracts. Since the fourth quarter of 2015 initiator [[transaction fee]] was reduced to 0 EUR/MWh, which contributed to a significant boost in the [[liquidity]]. The traded volumes jumped from 3 627,3 GWh in 2014 to 6 485,6 GWh in 2015. In 1 January 2016 HUPX PHF listed 31 members. In addition to the settlement of transactions concluded on the exchange, OTC transactions can be registered as well.

== Market Coupling ==
4M MC is an ATC based day-ahead implicit allocation process striving on the compatibility with the EU Target Model while taking into account the fact that 4M solution is to be considered as an interim step before the [[Central and Eastern Europe|Central Eastern European]] (“CEE”) regional solution. The primary target of the market coupling is to assure a deeper integration of regional power markets. The process aims at maximizing the energy flow from the low price area to the high price area by taking into account the available cross-border capacity. Consequently, price levels among the individual market areas converge. By this procedure, not only the security of supply can be increased but the price volatility on relevant power markets can be moderated and the power sale and purchase can become more effective.
The [[Czech Republic|Czech]], [[Slovakia|Slovak]], Hungarian and [[Romania]]n NRAs, TSOs and PXs jointly implemented the [http://www.mavir.hu/ru/web/mavir-en/press-release-archive/-/asset_publisher/A9uYMbcwFdjH/content/romania-joins-the-cz-sk-hu-market-coupling-project;jsessionid=vyG1SMQXhLBN4cCTlGZv9yy6G18G1JCrnj2bS6W0RZzBYTyn3vph!-1819791698!-1221819036!1384906839358?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mavir.hu%2Fru%2Fweb%2Fmavir-en%2Fpress-release-archive%3Bjsessionid%3DvyG1SMQXhLBN4cCTlGZv9yy6G18G1JCrnj2bS6W0RZzBYTyn3vph!-1819791698!-1221819036!1384906839358%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_A9uYMbcwFdjH%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_pos%3D1%26p_p_col_count%3D2 extension of CZ-SK-HU Market Coupling to Romanian day-ahead electricity market (4M MC)] on 19 November 2014 based on PCR solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAVIR Ltd - 4MC Market Coupling|url=https://www.mavir.hu/documents/10262/160363/4M+MC+WS+ppt_final+EN_complete+HU_final.pdf/bb0f17ad-d721-4739-abe6-ffcc373b04e3|website=MAVIR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Type of HUPX Members ==
According to the prevailing regulations of the [http://net.jogtar.hu/jr/gen/hjegy_doc.cgi?docid=A0700086.TV Hungarian Electric Energy Act], there are six types of entities that can become HUPX Members on HUPX:

* Electricity Trader (with a valid electricity trading permit issued by the Hungarian Energy Office pursuant to section 88 of the Electric Energy Act);

'''''How to Survive a Robot Uprising: Tips on Defending Yourself Against the Coming Rebellion''''' is a semi-[[satirical]] book by [[Daniel H. Wilson|Daniel Wilson]] published in November 2005.

The book gives tongue-in-cheek advice on how one can survive in the event that robots [[Technological singularity|become too intelligent]] and [[Cybernetic revolt|rebel against the human race]].  ''How to Survive a Robot Uprising'' is partially based on scientific fact, and is a prime example of [[deadpan]] humor.

[[Wired magazine|''Wired'' magazine]] gave it a 2006 Rave Award, calling it "equal parts sci-fi send-up and technical primer". [[Maclean's]] called the book "very funny and highly informative."&lt;ref name="Maclean's"&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 7, 2005|title=What to do when robots attack.|journal=Maclean's|volume= 118|issue= 45|pages=70|issn=0024-9262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[American Library Association]] designated the book a 2007 ALA “Popular Paperback for Young Adults”.

Wilson received a [[Ph.D.]] in Robotics from [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s [[Robotics Institute]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].

In the summer of 2005, [[Paramount Pictures]] optioned film rights to the book and hired [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] and [[Ben Garant|Robert Ben Garant]] (both members of ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]'' comedy troupe and co-creators of the ''[[Reno 911!]]'' television series) to write a script based on the book. On April 26, 2006 [[comedian]] [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] signed with Paramount to star in the movie adaptation.&lt;ref name="Daily Variety"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fleming|first=Michael|author2=Chris Gardner|date=April 27, 2006|title=PAR LEADS 'UPRISING'|journal=Daily Variety|volume= 291|issue= 18|pages=1–18|issn=0011-5509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It runs parallel to Japan's volcanic arc, passing through central Honshū to near Nagoya, through [[Mikawa Bay]], then through the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]] from the [[Kii Channel]] and [[Naruto Strait]] to [[Shikoku]] along the [[Sadamisaki Peninsula]] and the [[Bungo Channel]] and [[Hōyo Strait]] to [[Kyūshū]].&lt;ref name="n" /&gt;

The sense of motion on the MTL is right-lateral strike-slip, at a rate of about 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm/yr.&lt;ref&gt;Okada, A., On the Quaternary faulting along the Median Tectonic Line, in ''Median Tectonic Line'' (in Japanese with English abstract), edited by R. Sugiyama, pp. 49–86, Tokai Univ. Press, Tokyo, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of motion is consistent with the direction of oblique convergence at the [[Nankai Trough]]. The rate of motion on the MTL is much less than the rate of convergence at the [[Nankai Trough|plate boundary]], making it difficult to distinguish the motion on the MTL from interseismic elastic straining in GPS data.&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, S. and Heki, K. (2001) Crustal velocity field of southwest Japan: Subduction and arc-arc collision, ''Journal of Geophysical Research'',vo. 106, no. B3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The upper part of Japanese islands was created at the edge of Eurasian plate 180 million years ago.{{fact|date=August 2016}}Then, 50 million years later, the lower part was created at the southern part of [[Yangtze]] continent. The lower part then rode on [[Izanagi plate]] and moved to the upper part. These islands were incorporated and formed the Japanese islands 70 million years ago. The boundary line between the upper part and lower part is the MTL.&lt;ref name="MTLresearch3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nishida-s.com/main/categ3/mtl-nagano/|title = 構造線はどのようにして出来たか|trans-title=How was the MTL created? |publisher= Susumu Nishida's homepage|accessdate= April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seismic activity==
The most important part of the MTL is called {{nihongo|'''the MTL fault zone'''|中央構造線断層帯|Chūō Kōzōsen Dansōtai}} which is an [[active fault]] and considered hazardous. It is separated into six regions defined by the most recent seismic activities. Although the MTL is a less seismically active region than others, earthquakes with magnitudes of 6 to 7 have occurred.&lt;ref name="MTLresearch1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jishin.go.jp/main/yosokuchizu/katsudanso/f081_083_085_086_089_chuo.htm|title = 中央構造線断層帯|trans-title=MTL fault zone|publisher=The Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion |accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known activity occurred about 3000 years ago, and the most recent in the 16th century. It is expected that the seismic activities will continue in the future. The boundaries of the regions are still being discussed, so the regions are not well defined.&lt;ref name="MTLresearch1" /&gt;

===Notable earthquakes===
The [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] of 1995 occurred on the [[Nojima Fault]], a branch of the MTL. Approximately 6,434 people lost their lives; about 4,600 of them were from Kobe.&lt;ref name="casualties"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It caused approximately ten trillion yen ($100 billion) in damage, 2.5% of Japan's GDP at the time.

==Regions==
===Chūbu===
The MTL goes from [[Shizuoka Prefecture]] to [[Nagano Prefecture]]. At Nagano prefecture, it lies between the Ina mountains and the Akaishi mountains. Then, it goes to  Tino-shi, the northern part of Nagano prefecture.&lt;ref name="MTLresearch2" /&gt;

===Kantō===       
The MTL goes from [[Shimonita, Gunma|Shimonita]] in [[Gunma Prefecture]] to the Hiki hill district in [[Saitama Prefecture]], and then continues down to the [[Kantō Plain]]. In the central Kanto Plain, boring tests have shown that the MTL lies 3000 meters beneath ground level in Saitama Prefecture. It is not clear where the MTL goes from there, but it is thought that it passes beneath [[Kashima, Ibaraki|Kashima]] or [[Ōarai, Ibaraki|Ōarai]] on the Pacific coast in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="MTLresearch2" /&gt;

===Kinki===
The MTL passes south of [[Awaji Island]] as it crosses the [[Kii Channel]] from Shikoku to the [[Kii Peninsula]]. On the [[Kii Peninsula]], it passes north of the Kinokawa River, from [[Wakayama, Wakayama|Wakayama]] on the west coast past [[Gojō, Nara|Gojō]] in [[Nara Prefecture]] (where the river is called the Yoshino River) to [[Mie Prefecture]] on the east coast. There is an active shear zone north of the river in the southern foothills of the Izumi Mountains, which separate [[Wakayama Prefecture]] from [[Osaka Prefecture]]. East of Nara Prefecture, shear zones along the MTL are less active. The MTL takes a northern turn and passes along the eastern foothills of the [[Kongō Range]], connecting to the shear zone along the east side of the Ikoma Mountains between Nara Prefecture and Osaka Prefecture.&lt;ref name="MTLresearch2" /&gt;

===Kyushu===
The MTL is known to pass through the region between Kunisaki Peninsula and Saganoseki Peninsula in [[Ōita Prefecture]]. However, because the [[Ōno River]] basin south of [[Ōita, Ōita|Ōita]] is covered by  late [[Mesozoic]] sedimentary rock, the geological continuity in the westward direction is unclear. According to one theory, the MTL may turn south around the Ōno River, connecting [[Usuki, Ōita|Usuki]] in Ōita Prefecture to the [[Yatsushiro, Kumamoto|Yatsushiro]] tectonic line in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]]. According to another theory, it may connect Ōita directly to the Kumamoto tectonic line.&lt;ref name="MTLresearch2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.osk.janis.or.jp/~mtl-muse/subindex03.htm|title=中央構造線ってなに？|trans-title=What is the Median Tectonic Line?|publisher=Oshika Museum of Japan Median Tectonic Line|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shikoku===
After crossing the [[Hōyo Strait]] from Kyushu to Shikoku, the MTL passes north of the [[Sadamisaki Peninsula]] to land at [[Iyo, Ehime|Iyo]] on the west coast of [[Ehime Prefecture]]. It continues eastward past the city of [[Saijō, Ehime|Saijō]] and along the foothills of the Ishizuchi Range. From [[Miyoshi, Tokushima|Miyoshi]] in [[Tokushima Prefecture]] it passes along the northern side of the [[Yoshino River]] until it arrives at the city of [[Tokushima, Tokushima|Tokushima]] on the east coast of the island.&lt;ref name="MTLresearch2" /&gt; There are active shear zones to the north of the MTL: north of Iyo and, in eastern Shikoku, along the southern foothills of the [[Sanuki Mountains]], at the northern border of Tokushima Prefecture.&lt;ref name="MTLresearch2" /&gt;

==Museum==
There is a museum dedicated to the tectonic line in [[Minami-Alps, Yamanashi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osk.janis.or.jp/~mtl-muse/ You are very welcome to the Oshika museum of Japan Median Tectonic Line. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kitt Peak''' ({{lang-ood|Ioligam}}) is a mountain in the U.S. state of Arizona, and at {{convert|6883|ft|0}} is the highest point in the [[Quinlan Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite summitpost |id=275488 |name=Kitt Peak |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the location of the [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]]. The [[radio telescope]] at the Observatory is one of ten dishes comprising the [[Very Long Baseline Array]] [[radio telescope]].

The peak was named in English by County Surveyor George J. Roskruge for his sister, Phillippa, who was the wife of William F. Kitt. On his 1893 Pima County Survey map, Roskruge spelled the name 'Kits'. At the request of the wife of George F. Kitt, the spelling was changed by decision in 1930.&lt;ref name="gnis"&gt;{{cite gnis |id=6726 |name=Kitt Peak |accessdate=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitt Peak is the second-highest peak on the [[Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation]], and as such is the second-most sacred after [[Baboquivari Peak]].  Near the summit is [[I'itoi]]'s Garden, the summer residence of the nation's elder brother deity.  The name Ioligam means "red stick" in reference to the abundance of [[manzanita]] bushes on and around the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/feat_folder?p_file=1018075 |first=John C. |last=Waugh |title=Indians Yield Telescope Site |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=June 27, 1960 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latex''' is a stable dispersion ([[emulsion]]) of [[polymer]] [[microparticle]]s in an [[aqueous medium]]. It is found in nature, but synthetic latexes can be made by [[polymerization|polymerizing]] a [[monomer]] such as [[styrene]] that has been [[emulsion|emulsified]] with [[surfactant]]s.

Latex as found in nature is a milky [[fluid]] found in 10% of all flowering plants ([[angiosperms]]).&lt;ref name="Agrawal"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anurag A. Agrawal |author2=d Kotaro Konno |date=2009 |title=Latex: a model for understanding mechanisms, ecology, and evolution of plant defense Against herbivory |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics]] |volume=40 |pages=311–331 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120307}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a complex emulsion consisting of [[protein]]s, [[alkaloid]]s, [[starch]]es, [[sugar]]s, [[Vegetable oil|oil]]s, [[tannin]]s, [[resin]]s, and [[Natural gum|gum]]s that [[coagulation|coagulate]] on exposure to air. It is usually exuded after tissue injury. In most plants, latex is white, but some have yellow, orange, or scarlet latex. Since the 17th century, latex has been used as a term for the fluid substance in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paul G. Mahlberg |date=1993 |title=Laticifers: an historical perspective |journal=[[The Botanical Review]] |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=1–23 |jstor=4354199 |doi=10.1007/bf02856611}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves mainly as [[Antipredator adaptation|defense]] against [[herbivorous]] [[insect]]s.&lt;ref name="Agrawal"/&gt; Latex is not to be confused with [[plant sap]]; it is a separate substance, separately produced, and with separate functions.

The word latex is also used to refer to natural latex [[rubber]], particularly non-[[vulcanization|vulcanized]] rubber. Such is the case in products like latex [[glove]]s, latex [[condom]]s and [[latex clothing]].

Originally, the name given to latex by indigenous Equator tribes who cultivated the plant was “caoutchouc”, from the words “caa” (tear) and “ochu” (tree), because of the way it is collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coco-mat.com/us_en/natural-materials/|title=Natural Materials - Coco-mat|last=|first=|date=|website=Coco-mat|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618084948/https://www.coco-mat.com/us_en/natural-materials/|archive-date=2017-06-18|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==

===Articulated laticifers===
The [[cell (biology)|cells]] ([[laticifer]]s) in which latex is found make up the laticiferous system, which can form in two very different ways. In many plants, the laticiferous system is formed from rows of cells laid down in the [[meristem]] of the [[Plant stem|stem]] or [[root]]. The [[cell wall]]s between these cells are dissolved so that continuous tubes, called latex vessels, are formed. Since these vessels are made of many cells, they are known as ''articulated laticifers''. This method of formation is found in the [[Papaveraceae|poppy family]] and in the [[rubber]] trees ([[Hevea brasiliensis|Para rubber tree]], members of the family [[Euphorbiaceae]], members of the [[Moraceae|mulberry and fig family]], such as the Panama rubber tree ''[[Castilla elastica]]''), and members of the family [[Asteraceae]]. For instance, ''[[Parthenium argentatum]]'' the guayule plant, is in the tribe [[Heliantheae]]; other latex-bearing Asteraceae with articulated laticifers include members of the [[Cichorieae]], a [[clade]] whose members produce latex, some of them in commercially interesting amounts. This includes ''[[Taraxacum kok-saghyz]]'', a species cultivated for latex production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Taraxacum+kok-saghyz |title=Taraxacum kok-saghyz |publisher=Pfaf.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320155113/http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Taraxacum+kok-saghyz |archivedate=2014-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-articulated laticifers===
In the [[Asclepiadaceae|milkweed]] and [[Euphorbiaceae|spurge]] families, on the other hand, the laticiferous system is formed quite differently. Early in the development of the seedling, latex cells differentiate, and as the plant grows these latex cells grow into a branching system extending throughout the plant. In many [[Euphorbiaceae|euphorbs]], the entire structure is made from a single cell – this type of system is known as a ''non-articulated laticifer'', to distinguish it from the multi-cellular structures discussed above. In the mature plant, the entire laticiferous system is descended from a single cell or group of cells present in the [[embryo]].

The laticiferous system is present in all parts of the mature plant, including roots, stems, [[leaf|leaves]], and sometimes the [[fruit]]s. It is particularly noticeable in the [[Cortex (botany)|cortical]] tissues. Latex is usually exuded as a white liquid, but is some cases it can be clear, yellow or red, as in [[Cannabaceae]].&lt;ref name="Agrawal"/&gt;

==Productive species==
Latex is produced by 20,000 species from over 40 [[families]] occurring in multiple lineages in both [[dicotyledonous]] and [[monocotyledonous]] types of plant. It is also found in [[conifer]]s and [[pteridophyte]]s. Among tropical plant species 14% create latex, as opposed to 6% of temperate plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas M. Lewinsohn |date=1991 |title=The geographical distribution of plant latex |journal=[[Chemoecology]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=64–68 |doi=10.1007/BF01240668}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the fungal kingdom also produce latex upon injury, such as ''[[Lactarius deliciosus]]'' and other [[lactarius|milk-caps]]. This suggests it is the product of [[convergent evolution]] and has been selected for on many separate occasions.&lt;ref name="Agrawal"/&gt;

==Defense function==
[[File:Latex being collected from a tapped rubber tree.jpg|thumb|Rubber latex]]

Latex functions to protect the plant from herbivores. The idea was first proposed in 1887 by Joseph F. James, who noted that latex &lt;blockquote&gt;carries with it at the same time such disagreeable properties that it becomes a better protection to the plant from enemies than all the thorns, prickles, or hairs that could be provided. In this plant, so copious and so distasteful has the sap become that it serves a most important purpose in its economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joseph F. James |date=1887 |title=The milkweeds |journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=21 |issue= |pages=605–615 |jstor=2451222 |url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-2451222/2451222 |doi=10.1086/274519}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Evidence showing this defense function include the finding that [[slug]]s will eat leaves drained of their latex but not intact ones, that many insects sever the veins carrying latex before they feed, and that the latex of ''[[Asclepias humistrata]]'' (sandhill [[milkweed]]) kills by trapping 30% of newly hatched [[monarch butterfly]] caterpillars.&lt;ref name="Agrawal"/&gt;

Other evidence is that latex contains 50–1000× higher concentrations of defense substances than other plant tissues. These toxins include ones that are also toxic to the plant and consist of a diverse range of chemicals that are either poisonous or "[[Antinutrient|antinutritive]]". Latex is actively moved to the area of injury; in the case of ''[[Cryptostegia grandiflora]]'', this can be more than 70&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="Agrawal"/&gt;

The clotting property of latex is functional in this defense since it limits wastage and its stickiness traps insects and their mouthparts.&lt;ref name="Agrawal"/&gt;

It has been noted that while there exist other explanations for the existence of latex including storage and movement of plant nutrients, waste, and maintenance of water balance that "[e]ssentially none of these functions remain credible and none have any empirical support".&lt;ref name="Agrawal"/&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Opium pod cut to demonstrate fluid extraction1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Papaver somniferum|Opium poppy]] exuding fresh latex from a cut]]

The latex of many species can be processed to produce many materials.

[[Natural rubber]] is the most important product obtained from latex; more than 12,000 plant species yield latex containing rubber, though in the vast majority of those species the rubber is not suitable for commercial use.&lt;ref name='Bowers'&gt;{{cite book |author=J. E. Bowers |date=1990 |title=Natural Rubber-Producing Plants for the United States | publisher=National Agricultural Library |location=Beltsville, MD |oclc=28534889 |pages=1, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latex is used to make many other products including [[mattress]]es, [[glove]]s, [[swim cap]]s, [[condom]]s, [[catheter]]s and [[balloon]]s.

[[Balatá]] and [[gutta percha]] latex contain an inelastic polymer related to rubber.

Latex from the [[chicle]] and [[Dyera costulata|jelutong]] trees is used in [[chewing gum]].

Dried latex from the [[Papaver somniferum|opium poppy]] is called [[opium]], the source of several useful  [[alkaloid]]s, such as [[morphine]], [[codeine]] and [[papaverine]], as well as the street drug [[heroin]].

Synthetic latexes are used in [[coating]]s (e.g. latex paint) and [[glue]]s because they solidify by [[Coalescence (chemistry)|coalescence]] of the polymer particles as the water evaporates, and therefore can form films without releasing potentially toxic organic solvents in the environment. Other uses include cement additives, and to conceal information on [[scratchcard]]s. Latex, usually [[styrene]]-based, is also used in [[immunoassay]]s.

==Latex clothing==
{{Main article|Latex clothing}}
Latex is used in many types of [[clothing]]. Worn on the body (or applied directly by painting) it tends to be skin-tight, producing a "second skin" effect.

==Allergic reactions==
{{Main article|Latex allergy}}
Some people have a serious [[latex allergy]], and exposure to latex products such as [[latex glove]]s can cause [[anaphylactic shock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecoterrabeds.com/blogs/eco-terras-healthy-sleep-blog/latex-allergy-why-you-may-still-be-able-to-sleep-on-a-natural-latex-mattress|title=Latex Allergy - Eco Terra|access-date=2018-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Guayule]] latex has only 2% of the levels of protein found in ''[[Hevea]]'' latexes, and is being researched as a lower-allergen substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=De9RUVtQ5TQC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=artificial+polyisoprene+protein|title=Emulsion Polymerisation and Latex Applications|first1=Christopher D.|last1=Anderson|first2=Eric S.|last2=Daniels|date=8 May 2018|publisher=iSmithers Rapra Publishing|accessdate=8 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, chemical processes may be employed to reduce the amount of [[antibody generator|antigenic protein]] in ''Hevea'' latex, yielding alternative materials such as [[Vytex Natural Rubber Latex]] which provide significantly reduced exposure to latex allergens.

About half of people with [[spina bifida]] are also allergic to natural latex rubber, as well as people who have had multiple surgeries, and people who have had prolonged exposure to natural latex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/latex-allergy/DS00621/DSECTION=risk-factors|title=Latex allergy - Symptoms and causes|author=|date=|website=mayoclinic.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007231835/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/latex-allergy/DS00621/DSECTION=risk%2Dfactors|archivedate=7 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microbial degradation===
Several species of the [[microbe]] genera [[Actinobacteria|Actinomycetes]], [[Streptomyces]], [[Nocardia]], [[Micromonospora]], and [[Actinoplanes]] are capable of consuming rubber latex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|title=Physiological and Chemical Investigations into Microbial Degradation of Synthetic Poly(cis-1,4-isoprene)|author1=Helge B.

At the top end of the scale, which ranks from 0 to 5, are F5 tornadoes. These storms were estimated to have had winds between {{convert|260|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|318|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="winds"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Storm Prediction Center]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|year=2006|accessdate=June 25, 2013|title= Fujita Tornado Damage Scale|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/f-scale.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The winds estimated by the Fujita Scale are estimated values and have not been verified scientifically.&lt;ref name="winds"/&gt;|group="nb"|name="FujitaDisclaimer"}} Following two particularly devastating tornadoes in 1997 and 1999, engineers questioned the reliability of the scale. Ultimately, a new scale was devised that took into account 28 different damage indicators; this became known as the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]].&lt;ref name="EnhancedSPC"&gt;{{cite web|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=August 4, 2011|accessdate=June 25, 2013|title= The Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale) |url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/efscale/}}&lt;/ref&gt; With building designs taken more into account, winds in an EF5 tornado were estimated to be in excess of {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="EnhancedSPC2"&gt;{{cite web|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|year=2013|accessdate=June 25, 2013|title=Enhanced F Scale for Tornado Damage|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/efscale/ef-scale.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1950, there have been 59&amp;nbsp;officially rated F5 and EF5 tornadoes in the United States and 1 F5 in Canada. Additionally, the works of tornado expert [[Thomas P. Grazulis]] revealed the existence of several dozen more between 1880 and 1995. Grazulis also put into question the ratings of several currently rated F5 tornadoes. Outside the United States and Canada, seven tornadoes have been rated F5: two each in [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Italy]] and one in [[Russia]]. Several other tornadoes are also documented as possibly attaining this status.

Since structures are completely destroyed in both cases, the identification and assignment of scale between an EF4 tornado and an EF5 is often very difficult.&lt;ref name="Sig Tor"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grazulis |first=Thomas P. |authorlink=Thomas P.

Prior to 1950, assessments of F5 tornadoes are mostly based on the works of Thomas Grazulis. The NCDC accepted 38 of his classifications from between 1880 and 1950 as F5s. In addition to the accepted ones, he rated a further 25 during the same period.&lt;ref name="NCDCF5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grazulis"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grazulis|first=Thomas P. |authorlink=Thomas P. Grazulis |title=F5-F6 Tornadoes|publisher=The Tornado Project|year=2001 |location=St. Johnsbury, VT |isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1950 to 1970 tornadoes were assessed retrospectively, primarily using information recorded in government databases, and newspaper photographs and descriptions. Beginning in 1971, tornadoes were rated by the NWS using on-site damage surveys.&lt;ref name="F-Scale"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonald |first= James R. |authorlink=James R. McDonald |title=T. Theodore Fujita: His Contribution to Tornado Knowledge through Damage Documentation and the Fujita Scale |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society]] |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=63–72 |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |date=January 2001 |url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0477%282001%29000%3C0063%3ATTFHCT%3E2.3.CO%3B2 |doi=10.1175/1520-0477(2001)000&lt;0063:TTFHCT&gt;2.3.CO;2 |bibcode = 2001BAMS...82...63M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For United States tornadoes as of February 1, 2007, the [[Fujita scale]] has been recalibrated to more accurately match tornado speeds with their damage and to augment and refine damage descriptors. The new system is called the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]]. No earlier tornadoes will be reclassified, and no new tornadoes in the United States will be rated F5. France and Canada later adopted the EF-scale in years following.

In all, 63 tornadoes have been officially rated F5/EF5 since 1950: 59 in the United States and one each in Italy, France, Russia, and Canada. The works of Grazulis also revealed 16 more F5 tornadoes between 1950 and 1995, with four later being accepted by the NCDC.&lt;ref name="NCDCF5"/&gt; Since the implementation of the Enhanced Fujita scale on February 1, 2007, there have been nine officially rated EF5 tornadoes in the United States from May 4th, 2007-May 20th, 2013 to date, while previously fifty tornadoes were officially rated F5 on the original Fujita scale from May 11th, 1953-May 3rd, 1999.

| This tornado completely swept away an anchor-bolted farmhouse, leaving very little debris behind. Severe ground scouring occurred in the area, and nearby trees were completely debarked and denuded, some of which were ripped out of the ground and thrown long distances. Five cars on the property were thrown and torn to pieces, with very few automobile parts recovered besides several scraps of metal and some engine blocks scattered throughout nearby fields. Suspected by many to have been an F5, but was rated F4 due to the fact that the tornado was very slow-moving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=5391565 |website=NCDC Database |publisher=NCDC |access-date=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date=May 12, 2004 |title=Harper F-4 NWS Damage Survey Video |medium=Motion Picture |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnw-VG5KUb0 |access-date=February 27, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[2013 El Reno tornado]] – Largest tornado on record at {{convert|2.6|mi|km|}} wide. Was initially rated EF5 based solely on mobile Doppler radar measurements, which recorded winds over {{convert|295|mi/h|km/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. However, the most significant structural damage was rated EF3, as the tornado did not strike any buildings when the EF5 winds were recorded. Rating was eventually downgraded to EF3 because of this, though the practicality of the downgrade has been disputed by some meteorologists. Famous storm chaser [[Tim Samaras]] is one of the fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthsky.org/earth/why-was-el-reno-oklahoma-tornado-downgraded-to-ef-3 |title=Why was El Reno, Oklahoma tornado downgraded to EF3? |last1=Forbes |first1=Greg |last2=Daniel |first2=Matt |date=September 5, 2013|website=EarthSky.org|publisher=unknown|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=453682&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World oil consumption 1980 to 2007 by region.svg|thumb|upright=2|Daily oil consumption by region from 1980 to 2006.]]
The total worldwide [[oil consumption]] is 93 million bbl/day according to the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/aboutus/faqs/oil/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233305/http://www.iea.org/aboutus/faqs/oil/ |archivedate=2013-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{when|date=April 2017}}

== Trends ==
In 2010, [[world energy consumption]] of refined products increased 3.8%;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yearbook.enerdata.net/ Energy Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; which was the first increase since 2004. According to [https://web.archive.org/web/20110321034717/http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/ Enerdata], this trend was supported by fast-growing demand for [[road transport|road]] and [[air transport]], particularly in [[developing countries]]. In [[China]], demand for refined products surged by 12% due to increasing needs. Asia accounted for more than 40% of the overall increase in consumption.

In [[Latin America]], demand rose sharply by 5.7%, representing 13% of the increase. In [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], consumption grew by 7.3% (8.9% in Russia), while rising 4.2% in the [[Middle East]] (driven by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait). Each region contributed 8% to the overall increase.

Despite this growth, the US remains by far the largest user of oil, consuming more than China in 2010.
China may overtake the US around 2030. {{cite web|title=BP Energy Outlook 2035|url=http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/Energy-economics/Energy-Outlook/Energy_Outlook_2035_booklet.pdf|page=38|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402013418/http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/Energy-economics/Energy-Outlook/Energy_Outlook_2035_booklet.pdf|archivedate=2014-04-02|df=}}

This article lists the '''largest [[Electricity generation|power]] stations in the world''', the ten overall and the five of each type, in terms of current installed electrical [[Nameplate capacity|capacity]].&lt;!-- FACILITIES THAT ARE PLANNED OR UNDER-CONSTRUCTION HAVE A CURRENT INSTALLED CAPACITY OF 0, AND THUS SHOULD NOT BE LISTED --&gt; [[Non-renewable resource|Non-renewable]] power stations are those that run on [[coal]], [[fuel oil]]s, [[Nuclear power|nuclear]], [[natural gas]], [[oil shale]] and [[peat]], while [[Renewable resource|renewable]] power stations run on fuel sources such as [[biomass]], [[Geothermal power|geothermal heat]], [[hydroelectricity|hydro]], [[solar power|solar energy]], [[Solar thermal energy|solar heat]], [[Tidal power|tides]], [[Wave power|waves]] and the [[Wind power|wind]]. Only the most significant fuel source is listed for power stations that run on multiple sources.

At present, the largest power generating facility ever built is the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in [[China]]. The facility generates power by utilizing 32 [[Francis turbine]]s each having a capacity of {{nowrap|700 MW}} and two {{nowrap|50 MW}} turbines,&lt;ref name=CTGPC /&gt; totalling the installed capacity to {{nowrap|22,500 MW}}, more than twice the installed capacity of the largest nuclear power station, the [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant|Kashiwazaki-Kariwa]] (Japan) at {{nowrap|7,965 MW}}. As of 2017 no power station comparable to Three Gorges is under construction, as the largest under construction power stations are hydroelectric [[Baihetan Dam]] ({{nowrap|16,000 MW}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Hydropower Development Baihetan |url=http://nn.lsz.gov.cn/lry.asp?id=164 |publisher=Baihetan China – Ningxia County Public Information Network |accessdate=20 March 2011 |date=2 December 2009 |language=zh |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823083909/http://nn.lsz.gov.cn/lry.asp?id=164 |archivedate=23 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Belo Monte Dam]] ({{nowrap|11,233 MW}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Elekotrobras: Belo Monte|url=http://www.eletrobras.com/elb/main.asp?View=%7B46763BB8-3B05-432F-A206-C8F93CC3BA90%7D|format=PDF|accessdate=16 August 2012|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although currently only a proposal, the [[Grand Inga Dam]] in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|the Congo]] would surpass all existing power stations, including the Three Gorges Dam, if construction commences as planned. The design targets to top {{nowrap|39,000 MW}} in installed capacity, nearly twice that of the Three Gorges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Africa plans biggest dam project, the Grand Inga|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7358542.stm|work=BBC News|date=21 April 2008|accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Development of the Grand Inga|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/africa/grand-inga-grand-illusions|accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Grand Inga Dam|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/345|accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another proposal, [[Penzhin Tidal Power Plant Project]], presumes an installed capacity up to {{nowrap|87,100 MW}}.

In Australia, the 1992 ''[[National Forest Policy Statement]]'' (NFPS) made specific provision for the protection of old growth forests. The NFPS initiated a process for undertaking assessments of forests for conservation values, including old growth values. A working group of state and Australian Government agencies took the NFPS definition into consideration in developing a definition that was accepted by all governments (JANIS 1997).&lt;ref name="sfdm-ogfia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/d274e552-b0bd-4999-925b-e46a19ffc3d1/files/ld29oldgrowthforests.pdf|title=Science for Decision Makers - Old Growth Forest in Australia: Conservation status and significance for timber production|author1=Rodney J. Keenan|author2=Michael F. Ryan|publisher=[[Bureau of Rural Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{cquote|Old growth forest is ecologically mature forest where the effects of disturbances are now negligible.|author=JANIS 1997}}

In 2008, only a relatively small area (15%) of Australia's forests (mostly tall, wet forests) had been assessed for old-growth values.&lt;ref name="clancy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldforests.com.au/pages/Presentations/Clancy.pdf|title=Old-growth forest areas and their reservation status across Australia|year=2008|author1=Adam Gerrand|author2=Tim Clancy|author3=Stuart Davey|author4=Geoff Dunn|author5=Ian Frakes|publisher=[[Bureau of Rural Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the {{Convert|23|e6ha|abbr=off}} of forest in Australia assessed for their old-growth status, {{Convert|5|e6ha|abbr=off}} (22%) is classified as old-growth.&lt;ref name="sofr2013"/&gt; Almost half of Australia's identified old-growth forest is in NSW, mostly on public land.&lt;ref name="clancy"/&gt; More than 73% of Australia's identified old-growth forests are in formal or informal nature conservation reserves.&lt;ref name="sofr2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/Documents/sofr2013-web2.pdf|title=Australia's State of the Forests Report 2013|year=2013|publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Western Australia became the first state in Australia to cease logging in old-growth forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpc.wa.gov.au/protecting-old-growth-forests|title=Protecting Old-Growth Forests|publisher=[[Forest Products Commission]], [[Government of Western Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "old-growth forests" is rarely used in [[New Zealand]], instead, "[[The Bush]]" is used to refer to native forests. There are large contiguous areas of forest cover that are [[protected area]]s.

'''National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day''' was created by the [[Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association]] to help raise awareness of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies and to celebrate how far the industry has come as well as the vast potential the technologies have today and in future. 

October 8th (10.08) was chosen in reference to the atomic weight of hydrogen (1.008).

National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day was officially launched on October 8, 2015. 

==  National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day Events ==

'''''Natural History of an Alien''''' also known as '''''Anatomy of an Alien''''' in the US was an early Discovery Channel mockumentary similar to ''[[Alien Planet]]'', aired in 1998. This mockumentary featured various alien ecosystem projects from the Epona Project to [[Ringworld]]. It also featured many notable scientists and science fiction authors such as [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Dr. Jack Cohen]], [[Derek Briggs]], [[Christopher McKay (planetary scientist)|Christopher McKay]], [[David Wynn-Williams]], [[Emily Holton]], [[Peter Cattermole]], [[Brian Aldiss]], [[Sil Read]], [[Wolf Read]], Edward Smallwood, [[Adega Zuidema]], [[Steve Hanly]], [[Kevin Warwick]] and [[Dougal Dixon]].

==Aliens==
* '''Europa Cone Bacteria''', orange-gray [[bacteria]] that are in huge towers. These towers rise many miles above the [[seabed|ocean floor]]. Inside these vents, warm water rises, nourishing layer upon layer of bacteria.
* '''Europa Sea Vent Herbivore''', a giant, gray, [[shark]]-like swimmer that feeds on bacteria in schools with a [[suction cup]]-like mouth on an extended, ''[[Opabinia]]''-like trunk. These trunk-shaped mouths pierce the vents to suck in vast quantities of bacteria. These grazers are territorial and like [[squid]] on Earth, flash warning glows to drive away rivals. They make a series of [[dolphin]]-like cries.
* '''Europa Sea Vent Carnivore''', a predatory, yellow-green, echolocating, streamlined, shark-like swimmer that is built for speed and preys on the Europa Sea Vent Herbivores. Like the Europa Sea Vent Herbivores, the Europa Sea Vent Carnivores also have an ''Opabinia''-like snout, but used instead to kill Europa Sea Vent Herbivores.
* '''Pteropede''', a gray-green, [[millipede]]-like creature from High Gravity Planet with accordion-folding, [[dragon]]-like wings. It resembles a [[dragonfly]] when it flies. It may be able to take advantage over of the denser air to fly, but high gravity can lead to a bumpy landing. To support its great weight, the creature's eight legs are directly under its body. It breathes through [[lungs]] in the tip of its tail, which is more efficient than the way [[insects]] take in air, so the Pteropede is able to pump [[oxygen]] through its large, heavy body. To grow, the Pteropede must enter the water. It is only in the buoyancy of water, where gravity has little effect, that the Pteropede can shed its skin and increase in size. Once the new skin is hardened, the Pteropede can return to the demanding heavy gravity environment on land.
* '''Sputnik Bug''', a small, blue, ''[[Eoarthropleura]]''-like creature from High Gravity Planet named after [[Sputnik 1]], the first artificial satellite in orbit. It has spines to protect it from a dangerous fall. Whenever it does fall, it immediately rolls up in a ball shape when it starts to tumble.
* '''Splatter Bug''', a small, brown, [[Eurypterid]]-like creature from High Gravity Planet. It sadly has nothing to protect its soft body. It's an evolutionary dead-end.
* '''Helliconian Tree''', a strange-looking [[tree]] from Helliconia with a [[Cooling tower|cooling tower]]-shaped tree trunk and branches on the very top with thin in width leaves, making the branch look like a [[moth]] antennae during the short summers. Like [[deciduous]] trees on Earth, the Helliconian Tree turns dormant during [[snow]]-filled [[winter]]s. It sheds its leaves but its branches curl up and go inside the Tree. The Tree then shields its top with an [[ice]]-like cap it grows.
* '''Sulfurian Balloon Plant''', a tall, orange organism from Sulfuria that lives off of sunlight. They are like giant [[balloons]], anchored to the ground and being pulled up by the gas that is inside of their flattish, [[pizza]]-like tops. They are like [[kelp]] on Earth. Babies sprout from the sides of the parent plant and eventually break off, becoming an independent adult.
* '''Parachute Worm''', a whitish-gray, [[earthworm]]-like creature from Sulfuria that lives off the gas of the Sulfurian Balloon Plant by sucking it out. Newly-born larvae resemble twigs with two [[umbrella]]-like extensions. Larvae are born live as the mother is feeding. After a little while, the young depart from their mothers and use the umbrella-like extensions to parachute down gently through the murk of the [[atmosphere]] to the planet floor and shed their umbrella extensions. After falling into water and shedding, the young Parachute Worms feed on the nutritious roots of the Sulfurian Balloon Plants. When they have fattened up, the adults make their epic journey back up the stalks to mate. The Parachute Worm is a perpetual migrant. Its lifecycle is a response to this extreme environment.
* '''Epona Pagoda Tree''', a thin-looking, green tree from Epona with large, disk-shaped leaves surrounding it. The reason why the leaves are so huge is because they need to get as much [[carbon dioxide]] as possible. They are able to do a remarkable ability of movement. If a [[herbivore]] comes to nibble on them, they are able to fold back their branches.
* '''Spring Croc''', a green, hopping, two-legged, predatory, [[Venus flytrap]]-like creature from Epona. It is the major predator on Epona. It lies in wait for its prey (usually partially submerged). It is extremely vicious. It is a lot like the Earth shark, for it mostly focuses on eating. It does not need to be intelligent, it just has to be quiet.
* '''Uther''', a brownish-gray, flyer from Epona resembling a cross between a ''[[Sharovipteryx]]'' and a [[pterosaur]]. They are descended from [[flying fish]]-like ancestors. They started out in their [[Bird|avian]]-like lifestyle hunting Salacopods (small, [[amphibian]]-like creatures). They later on graduated to larger carcasses to feed on. Then they started to become predators themselves. In order to fly, they have a boost, which is a combination of [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[ethanol]], which hyper-oxygenates their blood. It allows them incredible stamina.
* '''Curlywhorl''', an arboreal, purple-red, [[centipede]]/[[iguana]]-like creature from Greenworld that came from aquatic, [[sea star]]-like ancestors (like all the other inhabitants of Green World did).
* '''Pud''', a small, green, 3-eyed, [[weevil]]-like creature from Greenworld's [[equator]]. There are thousands of species across the planet. They are like the [[beetles]] of Earth. It has 6 limbs, 5 are used for grasping and one is used for movement. This gives the Pud a hopping motion. They are often seen in groups, foraging for food in the [[undergrowth]]. They scavenge on fallen [[fruit]]. They have many predators and can sense danger coming with their three sensitive, leaf-like antennae. It makes a series of small-pitched chirps and hoots.
* '''Kwank''', a large, reddish-brown, [[robber crab]]-like creature from Greenworld with a [[turtle]]-like shell on its back. It is like the [[anteater]] of Green World, for it often goes for Puds.
* '''Unidentified large, [[lobster]]-like predator''', an inhabitant of Greenworld that sometimes attacks and eats Kwanks. It was only shown in the form of its shadow.
* '''Unidentified intelligent, green alien''', a yellow-eyed, green-skinned [[sapience|sapient]] being from an unknown world. A female reveals herself as the [[narrator]] at the end of the program.

The '''Paleogene''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|l|i|ə|dʒ|iː|n|,_|ˈ|p|eɪ|l|i|ə|-}}; [[British English|also spelled]] '''Palaeogene''' or '''Palæogene'''; informally '''Lower Tertiary''' or '''Early Tertiary''') is a [[geologic period|geologic period and system]] that spans 43 million years from the end of the [[Cretaceous]] Period {{period end|Cretaceous}} million years ago ([[annum|Mya]]) to the beginning of the [[Neogene]] Period {{period start|neogene}} Mya. It is the beginning of the [[Cenozoic]] [[Era]] of the present [[Phanerozoic]] Eon.&lt;ref&gt; Formerly, the period covered by the Paleogene was called the first part of the [[Tertiary]], whose usage is no longer official. [http://www.stratigraphy.org/bak/geowhen/TQ.html "Whatever happened to the Tertiary and Quaternary?"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which [[evolution of mammals|mammals diversified]] from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse [[animal]]s in the wake of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] that ended the preceding [[Cretaceous]] Period.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Meredith, Jan E. Janecka, John Gatesy, Oliver A. Ryder, Colleen A. Fisher, Emma C. Teeling, Alisha Goodbla, Eduardo Eizirik, Taiz L. L. Simão, Tanja Stadler, Daniel L. Rabosky, Rodney L. Honeycutt, John J. Flynn, Colleen M. Ingram, Cynthia Steiner, Tiffani L. Williams, Terence J. Robinson, Angela Burk-Herrick, Michael Westerman, Nadia A. Ayoub, Mark S. Springer, William J. Murphy. 2011. Impacts of the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution and KPg extinction on mammal diversification. Science 334:521-524.&lt;/ref&gt;  

This period consists of the [[Paleocene]], [[Eocene]], and [[Oligocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|epochs]]. The end of the Paleocene (55.5/54.8&amp;nbsp;Mya) was marked by the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]], one of the most significant periods of global change during the Cenozoic, which upset oceanic and atmospheric circulation and led to the extinction of numerous deep-sea benthic [[foraminifera]] and on land, a major turnover in mammals. The terms 'Paleogene System' (formal) and 'lower [[Tertiary]] System' (informal) are applied to the rocks deposited during the 'Paleogene Period'. The somewhat confusing terminology seems to be due to attempts to deal with the comparatively fine subdivisions of time possible in the relatively recent geologic past, for which more details are preserved. By dividing the [[Tertiary]] Period into two periods instead of directly into five epochs, the periods are more closely comparable to the duration of 'periods' of the preceding [[Mesozoic]] and [[Paleozoic]] Eras.

==Climate and geography==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2015}}
The global climate during the Paleogene departed from the hot and humid conditions of the late [[Mesozoic era]] and began a cooling and drying trend which, despite having been periodically disrupted by warm periods such as the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]], persisted until the temperature begun to rise again during the [[Anthropocene]], ca. 1945. The trend was partly caused by the formation of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]], which significantly lowered oceanic water temperatures. A 2018 published study estimated that during the early Palaeogene about 56-48 million years ago, annual air temperatures, over land and at mid-latitude, averaged about 23–29 °C (± 4.7 °C), which is 5–10 °C higher than most previous estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0199-0|doi=10.1038/s41561-018-0199-0|title=High temperatures in the terrestrial mid-latitudes during the early Palaeogene|year=2018|authors=Naafs et al.|journal=Nature Geoscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=University of Bristol |title=Ever-increasing CO2 levels could take us back to the tropical climate of Paleogene period |work=ScienceDaily |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Or for comparison, it was 10 to 15 °C higher than current annual mean temperatures in these areas; the authors suggest that the current atmospheric carbon dioxide trajectory, if it continues, could establish these temperatures again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2018/july/co2-levels-paleogene-period.html|title=Ever-increasing CO2 levels could take us back to the tropical climate of Paleogene period|year=2018|work=University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Paleogene, the continents continued to [[plate tectonics|drift]] closer to their current positions. [[India]] was in the process of colliding with Asia, subsequently forming the [[Himalayas]]. The [[Atlantic Ocean]] continued to widen by a few centimeters each year. Africa was moving north to meet with Europe and form the [[Mediterranean Sea]], while South America was moving closer to North America (they would later connect via the [[Isthmus of Panama]]). Inland seas retreated from [[North America]] early in the period. Australia had also separated from Antarctica and was drifting toward Southeast Asia.

==Flora and fauna==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2015}}

[[Mammal]]s began a rapid diversification during this period. After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which saw the demise of the non-avian [[dinosaur]]s, mammals transformed from a few small and generalized forms that began to evolve into most of the modern varieties we see today. Some of these mammals would evolve into large forms that would dominate the land, while others would become capable of living in [[ocean|marine]], specialized terrestrial, and airborne environments. Those that took to the oceans became modern [[cetacean]]s, while those that took to the trees became [[primate]]s, the group to which humans belong. [[Birds]], which were already well established by the end of the [[Cretaceous]], also experienced an adaptive radiation as they took over the skies left empty by the now extinct [[Pterosaur]]s. In comparison to birds and mammals, most other branches of [[life]] remained relatively unchanged during this period.

As the Earth cooled, tropical plants became less numerous and were now restricted to equatorial regions. Deciduous plants, which could survive through the seasonal climates the world was now experiencing, became more common.{{clear left}}

==Geology==
===Oil industry relevance===
The Paleogene is notable in the context of [[offshore oil drilling]], and especially in [[Gulf of Mexico]] oil exploration, where it is commonly referred to as the "Lower [[Tertiary]]". These rock formations represent the current cutting edge of deep-water oil discovery.

Lower Tertiary rock formations encountered in the Gulf of Mexico oil industry usually tend to be comparatively high temperature and high pressure reservoirs, often with high sand content (70%+) or under very thick [[evaporite]] sediment layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halliburton.com/ps/default.aspx?pageid=3339&amp;navid=2113|title=Lower Tertiary|publisher=[[Halliburton]]|accessdate=2011-07-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929021358/http://www.halliburton.com/ps/default.aspx?pageid=3339&amp;navid=2113|archivedate=2011-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Path loss''' (or '''path attenuation''') is the reduction in power density ([[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]]) of an [[electromagnetic wave]] as it propagates through space. Path loss is a major component in the analysis and design of the [[link budget]] of a telecommunication system.

This term is commonly used in wireless communications and [[Wiktionary:signal|signal]] [[wave propagation|propagation]]. Path loss may be due to many effects, such as [[free-space loss]], [[refraction]], [[diffraction]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[aperture (antenna)|aperture]]-[[Transmission medium|medium]] [[coupling loss]], and [[absorption (optics)|absorption]]. Path loss is also influenced by terrain contours,  environment (urban or rural, vegetation and foliage), propagation medium (dry or moist air), the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, and the height and location of antennas.

==Causes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Path loss normally includes ''propagation losses'' caused by the natural expansion of the [[radio wave]] front in free space (which usually takes the shape of an ever-increasing sphere), ''absorption losses'' (sometimes called penetration losses), when the signal passes through media not transparent to [[electromagnetic waves]], ''[[diffraction]] losses'' when part of the radiowave front is obstructed by an opaque obstacle, and losses caused by other phenomena.

The signal radiated by a transmitter may also travel along many and different paths to a receiver simultaneously; this effect is called [[Multipath propagation|multipath]]. Multipath waves combine at the receiver antenna, resulting in a received signal that may vary widely, depending on the distribution of the intensity and relative propagation time of the waves and bandwidth of the transmitted signal. The total power of interfering waves in a [[Rayleigh fading]] scenario varies quickly as a function of space (which is known as ''small scale [[fading]]''). Small-scale fading refers to the rapid changes in radio signal amplitude in a short period of time or distance of travel.

==Loss exponent==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
{{main|Log-distance path loss model}}
In the study of wireless communications, path loss can be represented by the path loss exponent, whose value is normally in the range of 2 to 4 (where 2 is for propagation in [[free space]], 4 is for relatively lossy environments and for the case of full [[specular reflection]] from the earth surface&amp;mdash;the so-called [[flat earth]] model). In some environments, such as buildings, stadiums and other indoor environments, the path loss exponent can reach values in the range of 4 to 6. On the other hand, a tunnel may act as a [[waveguide]], resulting in a path loss exponent less than 2.

Path loss is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]]. In its simplest form, the path loss can be calculated using the formula

:&lt;math&gt;L = 10\ n\ \log_{10}(d)+C&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the path loss in decibels, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the path loss exponent, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, usually measured in meters, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant which accounts for system losses.

==Radio engineer formula==
Radio and antenna engineers use the following simplified formula (derived from the [[Friis transmission equation|Friis Transmission Formula]]) for the signal path loss between the feed points of two [[isotropic]] antennas in free space:

Path loss in [[decibel|dB]]: 
:&lt;math&gt;L = 20\ \log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the path loss in decibels, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the transmitter-receiver distance in the same units as the wavelength. Note the power density in space has no dependency on &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;; The variable &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; exists in the formula to account for the [[Antenna aperture|effective capture area]] of the isotropic receiving antenna.&lt;ref name="Stutz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stutzman|first1=Warren|last2=Thiele|first2=Gary|title=Antenna Theory and Design|date=1981|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=0-471-04458-X|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prediction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Calculation of the path loss is usually called ''prediction''. Exact prediction is possible only for simpler cases, such as the above-mentioned ''free space'' propagation or the ''flat-earth model''. For practical cases the path loss is calculated using a variety of approximations.

''Statistical'' methods (also called ''stochastic'' or ''empirical'') are based on measured and averaged losses along typical classes of radio links. Among the most commonly used such methods are [[Hata Model for Urban Areas|Okumura-Hata]], the [[COST Hata model]], [[W.C.Y.Lee]], etc. These are also known as ''radio wave propagation models'' and are typically used in the design of [[cellular networks]] and [[public land mobile network]]s (PLMN). For wireless communications in the [[very high frequency]] (VHF) and [[ultra high frequency]] (UHF) frequency band (the bands used by walkie-talkies, police, taxis and cellular phones), one of the most commonly used methods is that of Okumura-Hata as refined by the [[Cost 231 Model|COST 231]] project. Other well-known models are those of Walfisch-Ikegami, [[W.C.Y. Lee]], and [[Erceg]]. For FM radio and TV broadcasting the path loss is most commonly predicted using the [[ITU]] model as described in [[P.1546]] (successor to [[P.370]]) recommendation.

Deterministic methods based on the physical laws of wave propagation are also used; [[ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]] is one such method. These methods are expected to produce more accurate and reliable predictions of the path loss than the empirical methods; however, they are significantly more expensive in computational effort and depend on the detailed and accurate description of all objects in the propagation space, such as buildings, roofs, windows, doors, and walls. For these reasons they are used predominantly for short propagation paths. Among the most commonly used methods in the design of radio equipment such as antennas and feeds is the [[finite-difference time-domain method]].

The path loss in other frequency bands ([[medium wave]] (MW), [[shortwave]] (SW or HF), [[microwave]] (SHF)) is predicted with similar methods, though the concrete algorithms and formulas may be very different from those for VHF/UHF. Reliable prediction of the path loss in the SW/HF band is particularly difficult, and its accuracy is comparable to weather predictions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Easy approximations for calculating the path loss over distances significantly shorter than the distance to the [[radio horizon]]:

* In free space the path loss increases with 20&amp;nbsp;dB per ''decade'' (one decade is when the distance between the transmitter and the receiver increases ten times) or 6&amp;nbsp;dB per ''octave'' (one octave is when the distance between the transmitter and the receiver doubles). This can be used as a very rough first-order approximation for (microwave) communication links;
* For signals in the UHF/VHF band propagating over the surface of the Earth the path loss increases with roughly 35–40&amp;nbsp;dB per decade (10–12&amp;nbsp;dB per octave). This can be used in cellular networks as a first guess.

==Examples==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
In cellular networks, such as [[UMTS]] and [[GSM]], which operate in the UHF band, the value of the path loss in built-up areas can reach 110–140&amp;nbsp;dB for the first kilometer of the link between the [[base transceiver station]] (BTS) and the [[mobile phone|mobile]]. The path loss for the first ten kilometers may be 150–190&amp;nbsp;dB (''Note'': These values are very approximate and are given here only as an illustration of the range in which the numbers used to express the path loss values ''can eventually be'', these are not definitive or binding figures—the path loss may be very different for the same distance along two different paths and it can be different even along the same path if measured at different times.)

In the radio wave environment for mobile services  the mobile antenna is close to the ground. [[Line-of-sight propagation]] (LOS) models are highly modified. The signal path from the BTS antenna normally elevated above the roof tops is refracted down into the local physical environment (hills, trees, houses) and the LOS signal seldom reaches the antenna. The environment will produce several deflections of the direct signal onto the antenna, where typically 2-5 deflected signal components will be vectorially added.

These refraction and deflection processes cause loss of signal strength, which changes when the mobile antenna moves (Raleigh fading), causing instantaneous variations of up to 20&amp;nbsp;dB. The network is therefore designed to provide an excess of signal strength compared to LOS of 8-25&amp;nbsp;dB depending on the nature of the physical environment, and another 10&amp;nbsp;dB to overcome the fading due to movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5616">A '''plastic crystal''' is a [[crystal]] composed of weakly interacting molecules that possess some orientational or conformational degree of freedom. The name plastic crystal refers to the mechanical softness of such phases: they resemble waxes and are easily deformed. If the internal degree of freedom is molecular rotation, the name '''rotor phase''' or '''rotatory phase''' is also used. Typical examples are the [[Polymorphism (materials science)|modification]]s Methane I and Ethane I. 
In addition to the conventional molecular plastic crystals, there are also emerging ionic plastic crystals, particularly organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) and protic organic ionic plastic crystals (POIPCs).&lt;ref name="1,2,4-Triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate as an archetypal pure protic organic ionic plastic crystal electrolyte for all-solid-state fuel cells"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Imidazolium methanesulfonate as a high temperature proton conductor"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; POIPCs are solid protic organic salts formed by proton transfer from a Brønsted acid to a Brønsted base and in essence are protic ionic liquids in the molten state, have found to be promising solid-state proton conductors for high temperature [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell]]s.&lt;ref name="1,2,4-Triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate as an archetypal pure protic organic ionic plastic crystal electrolyte for all-solid-state fuel cells"/&gt; Examples include 1,2,4-triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate&lt;ref name="1,2,4-Triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate as an archetypal pure protic organic ionic plastic crystal electrolyte for all-solid-state fuel cells"/&gt; and imidazolium methanesulfonate.&lt;ref name="Imidazolium methanesulfonate as a high temperature proton conductor"/&gt;

If the internal degree of freedom freezes in a disordered way, an [[orientational glass]] is obtained.

The orientational degree of freedom may be an almost free rotation, or it may be a jump diffusion between a restricted number of possible orientations, as was shown for [[carbon tetrabromide]].&lt;ref&gt;

The X-ray [[diffraction]] patterns of plastic crystals are characterized by strong diffuse intensity in addition to the sharp Bragg peaks.&lt;ref name="1,2,4-Triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate as an archetypal pure protic organic ionic plastic crystal electrolyte for all-solid-state fuel cells"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a powder pattern this intensity appears to resemble an amorphous background as one would expect for a liquid,&lt;ref name="1,2,4-Triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate as an archetypal pure protic organic ionic plastic crystal electrolyte for all-solid-state fuel cells"/&gt; but for a single crystal the diffuse contribution reveals itself to be highly structured. The Bragg peaks can be used to determine an average structure but due to the large amount of disorder this is not very insightful. It is the structure of the diffuse scattering that reflects the details of the constrained disorder in the system. Recent advances in two-dimensional detection at synchrotron beam lines facilitate the study of such patterns.

== Plastic crystals versus liquid crystals ==

Like [[liquid crystal]]s, plastic crystals can be considered a transitional stage between real solids and real liquids and can be considered ''soft matter''. Another common denominator is the simultaneous presence of order and disorder. Both types of phases are usually observed between the true solid and liquid phases on the temperature scale:

: true crystal -&gt; plastic crystal -&gt; true liquid
: true crystal -&gt; liquid crystal -&gt; true liquid

The difference between liquid and plastic crystals is easily observed in [[X-ray diffraction]]. Plastic crystals possess strong long range order and therefore show sharp Bragg reflections.&lt;ref name="1,2,4-Triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate as an archetypal pure protic organic ionic plastic crystal electrolyte for all-solid-state fuel cells"/&gt; Liquid crystals show no or very broad Bragg peaks because the order is not long range. The molecules that give rise to liquid crystalline behavior often have a strongly elongated or disc like shape. Plastic crystals consist usually of almost spherical objects. In this respect one could see them as opposites.

'''Power Shift''' is an annual youth summit which has been held in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1573629/20071106/index.jhtml |title=Youth Leaders Shift Attention To Environment At Power Shift Summit In D.C. |accessdate=2009-08-30 |date=2007-11-06 |publisher=[[MTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Shift NZ-Pacific 2012 on Facebook|url=https://www.facebook.com/PowerShiftNZPacific|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Power Shift Conferences are also being organised by members of the International [[Youth Climate Movement]] including [[Africa]], [[Japan]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powershiftcanada.org/ |title=Power Shift Canada |accessdate=2009-08-30 |publisher=[[Canadian Youth Climate Coalition]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the events is on [[climate change policy]].

== History ==
[[File:PowerShift09.jpg|thumb|left | Logo of the 2009 Power Shift conference]]

The first Power Shift conference was held from November 2 to 5, 2007 in [[Washington D.C.]], and was organised by the [[Energy Action Coalition]].&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt; The second [[United States|American]] conference occurred two years later on February 27 to March 2, 2009.

Following on from the success of the American format, the [[Australian Youth Climate Coalition]] organised a Power Shift event in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] on July 11 to July 13, 2009. Similarly, the [[UK Youth Climate Coalition]] has scheduled the first British version of the event to run from October 9 to October 12, 2009. The first [[New Zealand]] Power Shift will be run between the 7th and 9 December 2012 in [[Auckland]].

The aim of the Power Shift Conferences is to build the youth climate movement in their respective nations, which is achieved through workshops, expert panel discussions, keynote speakers, and a lobby day or a "Day of Action" as it is alternatively known.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Power Shift"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20071203/kamenetz |title=Climate Change Power Shift |accessdate=2009-08-30 |date=2007-11-15 |publisher=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Power Shift Conference took place from November 2 to 5 in 2007 with between 5,000 and 6,000 students and young people in attendance.&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt; It is claimed that due to the number of young people who attended the conference, it became the largest activist youth event on climate change in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehoot.net/articles/2114 |title=Powershift 07 |accessdate=2009-08-30 |date=2008-01-27 |publisher=[[The Hoot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], a rally of between 2,000 and 3,000 people on the steps of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] and a Lobby Day. The event was also attended by a number of keynote speakers which included [[Al Gore]]. The main aim of the first conference was to urge elected officials to pass legislation which would include three planks taken from the platform of the climate advocacy coalition [[1Sky]]:&lt;ref name="Climate Change Power Shift"/&gt;
*The creation of a 5 million-strong Clean Energy Job Corps
*The reduction of [[greenhouse gases]] to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, which scientists say is the baseline for mitigating the worst [[effects of global warming]]
*A moratorium on new coal plants and divestment from [[fossil fuel]] and highway subsidies.

On February 27 to March 2, 2009, the second American Power Shift Conference took place. Similarly to the first summit, it included workshops, panel discussions, and speakers focusing on addressing climate change and [[environmental justice]].  Casper ter Kuile the co-director of the UK Youth Climate Coalition states that it is more than a youth movement, it is "[[social movement]]" .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2009/feb/20/coal-protest-power-shift | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=Casper ter Kuile on Power Shift - a booming global youth climate movement comes of age | date=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time, keynote speakers included [[Van Jones]], [[Bill McKibben]] of [[350.org]], [[Ralph Nader]], and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehoot.net/articles/2114 |title=The Brandeis Hoot |accessdate=2009-08-30 |date=2007-11-09 |publisher=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third American Power Shift took place April 15 to 18, 2011 in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the [[Walter E. Washington Convention Center]]. The conference had over 10,000 attenders.  People came to support various [[environmental movement]]s, many in protest of [[Presidency of Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]]'s alleged weakness on environmental issues.{{citation needed|reason=How do we know the motivation of the attenders? Where do the statistics on the number of attenders come from?|date=April 2011}} Guest speakers included former [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. vice-president]] Al Gore, [[Greenpeace]] Executive Director [[Phil Radford]], and environmental advocate [[Van Jones]].

The fourth Power Shift conference in the US was also the first outside of Washington. It was instead held in [[Pittsburgh, PA]] at the [[David L. Lawrence Convention Center]] on October 19–21, 2013. Keynote speakers included Gasland director [[Josh Fox]], [[Sierra Club]] director [[Michael Brune]], and Kandi Mossett of the [[Indigenous Environmental Network]]. The program included a rally against coal production and the organization of protests against the [[Keystone XL Pipeline]].

=== The 2006 PowerShift Conferences ===
In 2006, a series of student conferences on [[energy security]] were organized under the name PowerShift by the 20/20 Vision Education Fund, a [[501(c)3]] organization based out of [[Maryland]]. (They were not affiliated with the 2007 and later Power Shift conferences organized by the [[Energy Action Coalition]].) Over 250 people participated in the first conference which took place in [[Kalamazoo]], MI on April 1, 2006 and featured former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] director [[Jim Woolsey]] giving a keynote speech on U.S. [[oil dependence]] and [[national security]]. The conferences also featured a simulated energy wargame called [[Oil Shockwave]], developed by non-profit groups Securing America's Future Energy (SAFE) and the National Commission on Energy Policy{{Who|date=August 2011}}. The website for the conference series has been taken down, but is [https://web.archive.org/web/20060402205921/http://power-shift.org/ viewable using the Internet Wayback Machine].

== Australian Power Shift conferences ==
Two years later in 2009, the [[Australian Youth Climate Coalition]], in partnership with the [[University of Western Sydney]], [[GetUp]] and [[Greenpeace]], organised the Australian Power Shift Conference on July 11 to 13, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/global-warming/climate-warriors-march-behind-little-green-book-20090710-dg2t.html |title=Climate warriors march behind little green book |accessdate=2009-09-01 |date=2009-07-11 |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | first=Kelsey | last=Munro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1,500 young people attended the summit. Guests included former Vice President of the United States [[Al Gore]],  the swimmer [[Ian Thorpe]] and the actress [[Brooke Satchwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/national/youth-speak-out-on-climate-change-goals-20090607-bzix.html |title=Youth speak out on climate change goals |accessdate=2009-09-01 |date=2009-07-06 |publisher=[[WAtoday]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event concluded with a flashmob action outside the [[Sydney Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullstory.com.au/html/s02_article/article_view.asp?article_id=1730&amp;nav_cat_id=-1&amp;nav_top_id=-1 |title=Thousands meet in Sydney for climate change fight |accessdate=2009-09-01 |date=2009-07-10 |publisher=Full Story}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the AYCC held three regional Power Shift Conferences in [[Adelaide]], [[Canberra]] and [[Geelong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aycc.org.au/projects/power-shift-2010-2/ |title=Power Shift 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-29 |publisher=[[Australian Youth Climate Coalition]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724131616/http://www.aycc.org.au/projects/power-shift-2010-2/ |archivedate=2010-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the AYCC organised Power Shift Conferences in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Brisbane]] with over 1,000 young people. Speakers included [[Bill McKibben]], [[Kumi Naidoo]], [[Anna Rose]], [[Dick Smith (entrepreneur)|Dick Smith]] and Dr. [[Karl Kruszelnicki]].

In 2013 the AYCC will hold Australia's largest ever Power Shift, in [[Melbourne]] from the 13–15 July.

== Canadian Power Shift conference ==
The first [[Canada|Canadian]] Power Shift event was held from October 23 to October 26, 2009 in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] by the Canadian Youth Climate Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://powershiftcanada.org/the-conference/ |title=The Conference |accessdate=2009-08-31 |publisher=[[Canadian Youth Climate Coalition]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830051719/http://powershiftcanada.org/the-conference/ |archivedate=2009-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent summits were held in Ottawa, ON in 2012; Victoria, BC in 2013; Halifax, NS in 2014; and Edmonton, AB in 2016.

== New Zealand Power Shift summit ==
A collaboration between [[350.org]] [[Aotearoa]] and [[Generation Zero (NZ Group)|Generation Zero]], a student environmental movement, and other individuals, will bring ''"Power Shift NZ-Pacific"'' to [[New Zealand]] for the first time between the 7th and 9 December 2012 at the [[University of Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Shift New Zealand Pacific 2012|url=http://www.powershift.org.nz|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confirmed speakers so far include; American Environmentalist [[Bill McKibben]], Mayor of Auckland [[Len Brown]] and [[Xena: Warrior Princess]] actress [[Lucy Lawless]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Shift New Zealand Pacific 2012 Event Details and Programme|url=http://powershift.org.nz/details/programme/#speakers|accessdate=22 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916111222/http://powershift.org.nz/details/programme/#speakers|archivedate=16 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UK Power Shift conferences ==
From 9–12 October 2009, the [[UK]] version of Power Shift was held at the [[Institute of Education]] in [[London]]. Modelled on a similar event to one organised by the [[Australian Youth Climate Coalition]] and carrying the same name as the [[Energy Action Coalition]] event in the USA, the event intended to develop the youth climate movement and provide young people with training on public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/feb/20/coal-protest-power-shift  |title=Power Shift: Global youth climate movement comes of age |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2009-05-27 |publisher= [[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The training was based on the techniques developed by [[Marshall Ganz]], a civil rights activist who is credited with devising the successful [[grassroots]] organizing model and public narrative training for [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/15/nation/na-ganz15 |title=Famed organizer sees history in the making |date=2008-06-15 |accessdate=2010-05-27 |publisher=[[LA Times]] | first=Scott | last=Martelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/oct/12/climate-change-dancers-parliament  |title=Shake your booty in Big Ben's shadow – teenagers dance to save the planet |date=2009-10-17 |accessdate=2009-05-27 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Power Shift event intended to serve as a feeder to the International Day of Action organised by [[350.org#International Day of Climate Action|350.org]] on October 24.

A PowerShift UK event scheduled in 2011 was cancelled, but large-scale youth climate movement events have been taking place annually under the name [https://web.archive.org/web/20120629044103/http://peopleandplanet.org/shared-planet Shared Planet] since 1999, organised by the UK's largest student-led climate campaigning network [[People &amp; Planet]].

On 3–4 May 2014 a Power Shift UK event was held in London, titled 'Breaking Down the Barriers and Diversifying the Climate Movement'.  Open to people from all walks of society who want to contribute to action on climate change, the event brought people across the UK together for a weekend of discussions and workshops, to share stories and ideas for action, and to challenge assumptions about diversifying the climate movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://world.350.org/uk-gps/2014/04/03/get-ready-for-action-at-power-shift-uk-2/|accessdate=2014-04-13 |publisher= Power Shift UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preserve Our Islands''' (previously known as '''Protect Our Islands''') is a [[grassroots]] organization, created by Senator [[Sharon Nelson]] and residents of [[Maury Island]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://crosscut.com/2010/12/how-maury-islands-mining-opponents-finally-prevail/|title=How Maury Island's mining opponents finally prevailed|date=2010-12-31|work=Crosscut|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, that is opposed to [[Glacier Northwest]] and their efforts to mine [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] on [[Maury Island]].

== The Founding ==
The Northwest Aggregates Company, also known as [[Glacier Northwest]] or Glaciers,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/wa-court-of-appeals/1220344.html|title=FindLaw's Court of Appeals of Washington case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; had announced that they wanted to expand their surface gravel mine in [[Maury Island]]. Specifically, in May 1998, the mining company intended to fill Sea Tac’s third runway; therefore, they sought for a shoreline exemption in order to fix their broken pier and loading facility&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; located on a land owned by the State of Washington&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Brief History of Vashon Island|last=Haulman|first=Bruce|publisher=The History Press|year=2016|isbn=9781626191693|location=Charleston, SC|pages=169-171}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, they requested a permit that would allow them to mine 7.5 million tons of gravel per year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Upon learning the extent of Glacier’s expansion and driven by the need to protect the island’s habitats and wildlife, [[Sharon Nelson]] and other homeowners and islanders formed Protect Our Islands (POI) (later named Preserve Our Islands) in opposition of the mine expansion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Preserve Our Islands vs. Glacier Northwest ==
POI had convinced the Washington State Department of Ecology to send biologists to study Glacier’s proposed mining area, which was located above Maury Island’s main water supply&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://crosscut.com/2010/12/how-maury-islands-mining-opponents-finally-prevail/|title=How Maury Island's mining opponents finally prevailed|date=2010-12-31|work=Crosscut|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They found high levels of arsenic and lead in the soil, elements that could contaminate the island’s [[aquifer]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/documents/0109032.pdf|title=Arsenic and lead soil contamination in King County|last=Abbett|first=Marian|date=January 2001|website=Washington State Department of Ecology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a permeable, underground layer of water-bed rock that acts as a reservoir for groundwater&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/aquifer/|title=aquifer|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-04-21|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This contamination can lead to development disabilities in humans who drink the water&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Despite Glacier’s proposal of building a 30-feet high, 150-feet wide, and 2,100-feet long sealed [[berm]] that would isolate the soil and prevent any contamination, POI and other opponents were still not reassured of the safety of the island’s water supply&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Initially, POI and other opponents of the mine were on the losing end as the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Glacier, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] (U.S.A.C.E.) approved Glacier’s permit, and the Washington State Supreme Court denied to hear POI’s case against Glacier.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Brief History of Vashon Island|last=Haulman|first=Bruce|publisher=The History Press|year=2016|isbn=9781626191693|location=Charleston, SC|pages=169-171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, things were looking up for the opposition. First, [[Doug Sutherland (American politician)|Doug Sutherland]], a supporter of the mine expansion, lost the position of Commissioner of Public Lands to [[Peter J. Goldmark]], an opponent of the mine expansion.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Second, a statewide effort to restore Puget Sound was initiated by Governor [[Christine Gregoire|Chris Gregoire]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Third, with the support of the Backbone Campaign, POI organized a protest at the Glacier mine area with more than 500 protesters; this garnered media attention and gave this issue greater visibility&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. Fourth, in 2009, US District Judge [[Ricardo S. Martinez|Ricardo Martinez]] declared that construction on the loading facility can no longer continue until the U.S.A.C.E. thoroughly assesses the environmental implications of Glacier’s project.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the end, Glacier Northwest ended the mine expansion and the site was turned into the 235-acre King County Marine Park, after it was purchased by King County in January 8, 2011.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A '''rolag''' ([[Scottish Gaelic]]: '''roileag''') is a roll of fibre generally used to [[Spinning (textiles) |spin]] [[woollen]] yarn. A rolag is created by first carding the fibre, using [[Carding |handcards]], and then by gently rolling the fibre off  the cards. If properly prepared, a rolag will be uniform in width, distributing the fibres evenly. The word derives from the Scottish Gaelic word for a small roll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/lochist/periodicals/bittersweet/su75f.htm |last1=Hoke |first1=Alexa |last2=Brandt |first2=Terry |title=Through the Wool Cards |journal=Bittersweet |volume=II |issue=4 |date=Summer 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Animal fiber|Animal fibres]] have traditionally been used to create rolags, but today's spinners use many different fibre materials, including manufactured and [[Fiber crop|plant fibres]].

The desert comprises much of [[North Africa]], excluding the fertile region on the [[Mediterranean Sea]] coast, the [[Atlas Mountains]] of the [[Maghreb]], and the [[Nile Valley]] in [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. It stretches from the [[Red Sea]] in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains. To the south, it is bounded by the [[Sahel]], a belt of [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|semi-arid tropical savanna]] around the [[Niger River]] valley and the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan Region]] of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The Sahara can be divided into several regions including: the western Sahara, the central [[Ahaggar Mountains]], the [[Tibesti Mountains]], the [[Aïr Mountains]], the [[Ténéré]] desert, and the [[Libyan Desert]].

For several hundred thousand years, the Sahara has alternated between desert and savanna grassland in a 41,000 year cycle caused by changes ("[[precession]]") in the Earth's axis as it rotates around the sun, which change the location of the [[North African Monsoon]]. It is next expected to become green in about 15,000 years (17,000 AD). There is a suggestion that the last time that the Sahara was converted from savanna to desert it was partially due to [[overgrazing]] by the [[cattle]] of the local population.&lt;ref name="Humans as Agents in the Termination of the African Humid Period"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=K.

The Sahara covers large parts of [[Algeria]], [[Chad]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Niger]], [[Western Sahara]], [[Sudan]] and [[Tunisia]]. It covers {{convert|9|e6km2|sqmi}}, amounting to 31% of Africa. If all areas with a mean annual precipitation of less than 250&amp;nbsp;mm were included, the Sahara would be {{convert|11|e6km2|sqmi}}. It is one of three distinct [[physiographic provinces]] of the [[Physiographic regions of the world#Compendium table of the worlds physiographic regions|African massive physiographic division]].

The Sahara is mainly rocky [[hamada]] (stone plateaus); [[erg (landform)|ergs]] (sand seas - large areas covered with sand [[dune]]s) form only a minor part, but many of the [[sand dune]]s are over {{convert|180|m}} high.&lt;ref&gt;Strahler, Arthur N. and Strahler, Alan H.

New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|0471850640}}. p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aeolian processes|Wind]] or rare rainfall shape the desert features: sand dunes, dune fields, sand seas, stone plateaus, gravel plains (''reg''), [[wadi|dry valleys]] (''wadi''), [[dry lake]]s (''oued''), and [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] (''shatt'' or ''chott'').&lt;ref name=PA1327&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1327|name=Sahara desert|accessdate=30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual landforms include the [[Richat Structure]] in Mauritania.

Several deeply dissected mountains, many volcanic, rise from the desert, including the [[Aïr Mountains]], [[Ahaggar Mountains]], [[Saharan Atlas]], [[Tibesti Mountains]], [[Adrar des Iforas]], and the Red Sea hills. The highest peak in the Sahara is [[Emi Koussi]], a [[shield volcano]] in the [[Tibesti]] range of northern Chad.

The central Sahara is [[hyperarid]], with sparse vegetation. The northern and southern reaches of the desert, along with the highlands, have areas of sparse grassland and [[desert shrub]], with trees and taller shrubs in [[wadis]], where moisture collects. In the central, hyperarid region, there are many subdivisions of the great desert: [[Tanezrouft]], the [[Ténéré]], the [[Libyan Desert]], the [[Eastern Desert]], the [[Nubian Desert]] and others. These extremely arid areas often receive no rain for years.

To the north, the Sahara skirts the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in Egypt and portions of Libya, but in [[Cyrenaica]] and the [[Maghreb]], the Sahara borders the [[Mediterranean forest, woodland, and scrub]] eco-regions of northern Africa, all of which have a [[Mediterranean climate]] characterized by hot summers and cool and rainy winters. According to the botanical criteria of [[Frank White (botanist)|Frank White]]&lt;ref&gt;Wickens, Gerald E. (1998) ''Ecophysiology of Economic Plants in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands''. Springer, Berlin. {{ISBN|978-3-540-52171-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and geographer Robert Capot-Rey,&lt;ref name=Grove1958&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grove, A.T.|author2= Nicole|origyear=1958|year=2007|title=The Ancient Erg of Hausaland, and Similar Formations on the South Side of the Sahara|journal=The Geographical Journal|volume=124|issue=4|pages=528–533|doi=10.2307/1790942|jstor=1790942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bisson2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Bisson, J.|year=2003|title=Mythes et réalités d'un désert convoité: le Sahara|publisher=L'Harmattan|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; the northern limit of the Sahara corresponds to the northern limit of [[date palm]] cultivation and the southern limit of the range of [[esparto]], a grass typical of the Mediterranean climate portion of the Maghreb and [[Iberia]]. The northern limit also corresponds to the {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Isotherm (contour line)|isohyet]] of annual precipitation.&lt;ref name=Walton2007&gt;{{cite book|author=Walton, K.|year=2007|title=The Arid Zones|publisher=Aldine|asin=B008MR69VM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the south, the Sahara is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of dry [[tropical savanna]] with a summer rainy season that extends across Africa from east to west. The southern limit of the Sahara is indicated botanically by the southern limit of ''[[Cornulaca monacantha]]'' (a drought-tolerant member of the [[Chenopodiaceae]]), or northern limit of ''[[Cenchrus biflorus]]'', a [[Poaceae|grass]] typical of the Sahel.&lt;ref name="Grove1958"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisson2003"/&gt; According to climatic criteria, the southern limit of the Sahara corresponds to the {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} isohyet of annual precipitation (this is a long-term average, since [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] varies annually).&lt;ref name="Walton2007"/&gt;

Important cities located in the Sahara include [[Nouakchott]], the capital of Mauritania; [[Tamanrasset]], [[Ouargla]], [[Béchar]], [[Hassi Messaoud]], [[Ghardaïa]], and [[El Oued]] in Algeria; [[Timbuktu]] in Mali; [[Agadez]] in Niger; [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]] in Libya; and [[Faya-Largeau]] in Chad.

==Climate==
The Sahara is the world's largest low-latitude [[hot desert]]. The area is located in the [[horse latitudes]] under the [[subtropical ridge]], a significant belt of semi-permanent subtropical warm-core high pressure where the air from upper levels of the troposphere tends to sink towards the ground. This steady descending airflow causes a warming and a drying effect in the upper troposphere. The sinking air prevents evaporating water from rising and, therefore, prevents the adiabatic cooling, which makes cloud formation extremely difficult to nearly impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home - Institute Water for Africa|url=http://www.water-for-africa.org/en/sahara_climate.html|website=www.water-for-africa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The permanent dissolution of clouds allows unhindered light and thermal radiation. The [[Atmospheric instability#Stable atmosphere|stability of the atmosphere]] above the desert prevents any convective overturning, thus making rainfall virtually non-existent. As a consequence, the weather tends to be sunny, dry and stable with a minimal risk of rainfall. Subsiding, diverging, dry air masses associated with subtropical [[high-pressure system]]s are extremely unfavorable for the development of convectional showers. The subtropical ridge is the predominant factor that explains the [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') of this vast region. The lowering of air is the strongest and the most effective over the eastern part of the Great Desert, in the Libyan Desert which is the sunniest, driest and the most nearly "rain-less" place on the planet rivaling the [[Atacama Desert]], lying in [[Chile]] and [[Peru]].

The rainfall inhibition and the dissipation of cloud cover are most accentuated over the eastern section of the Sahara rather than the western. The prevailing [[air mass]] lying above the Sahara is the continental tropical (cT) air mass, which is hot and dry. Hot, dry air masses primarily form over the North-African desert from the heating of the vast continental land area, and it affects the whole desert during most of the year. Because of this extreme heating process, a [[thermal low]] is usually noticed near the surface, and is the strongest and the most developed during the summertime. The [[Sahara High]] represents the eastern continental extension of the [[Azores High]],{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} centered over the [[North Atlantic Ocean]]. The subsidence of the Sahara High nearly reaches the ground during the coolest part of the year while it is confined to the upper troposphere during the hottest periods.

The effects of local surface low pressure are extremely limited because upper-level subsidence still continues to block any form of air ascent. Also, to be protected against rain-bearing weather systems by the atmospheric circulation itself, the desert is made even drier by his geographical configuration and location. Indeed, the extreme aridity of the Sahara can not be only explained by the subtropical high pressure. The [[Atlas Mountains]], found in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia also help to enhance the aridity of the northern part of the desert. These major mountain ranges act as a barrier causing a strong [[rain shadow]] effect on the leeward side by dropping much of the humidity brought by atmospheric disturbances along the [[polar front]] which affects the surrounding Mediterranean climates.

The primary source of rain in the Sahara is the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], a continuous belt of low-pressure systems near the equator which bring the brief, short and irregular [[rainy season]] to the [[Sahel]] and southern Sahara. Rainfall in this giant desert has to overcome the physical and atmospheric barriers that normally prevent the production of precipitation. The harsh climate of the Sahara is characterized by: extremely low, unreliable, highly erratic rainfall; extremely high sunshine duration values; high temperatures year-round; negligible rates of [[relative humidity]]; a significant [[diurnal temperature variation]]; and extremely high levels of [[potential evaporation]] which are the highest recorded worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffiths|first1=Ieuan L. l|title=The Atlas of African Affairs|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135855529|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8C40QP8vyU0C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Sahara+Desert+a+wide+area+experiences+in+excess+of&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mU0xVdbGDoScsgGv9YHwDw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sahara%20Desert%20a%20wide%20area%20experiences%20in%20excess%20of&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature===
The sky is usually clear above the desert and the [[sunshine duration]] is extremely high everywhere in the Sahara. Most of the desert has more than 3,600 h of bright sunshine annually or over 82% of the time, and a wide area in the eastern part experiences in excess of 4,000 h of bright sunshine a year or over 91% of the time. The highest values are very close to the theoretical maximum value. A value of 4,300 h or 98% of the time would be recorded in [[Upper Egypt]] ([[Aswan]], [[Luxor]]) and in the Nubian Desert ([[Wadi Halfa]]).&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oliver|first1=John E.|title=Encyclopedia of World Climatology|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402032646|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mwbAsxpRr0C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=4,300+hours+of+sunshine+Wadi+Halfa&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lNwgVZPJOIut7gaB5IC4Dg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=4%2C300%20hours%20of%20sunshine%20Wadi%20Halfa&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual average [[sunlight|direct solar irradiation]] is around 2,800 kWh/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; year) in the Great Desert. The Sahara has a huge potential for solar energy production.[[File:Sahara desert.jpg|thumb|Sahara desert]]

The constantly high position of the sun, the extremely low relative humidity, and the lack of [[vegetation]] and rainfall make the Great Desert the hottest continuously large area worldwide, and the hottest place on Earth during summer in some spots. The average high temperature exceeds {{convert|38|to|40|C|F|1|disp=or}} during the hottest month nearly everywhere in the desert except at very high altitudes. The highest officially recorded average high temperature{{Clarify|reason=Average over what time period?|date=April 2017}} was {{convert|47|C|F|1|disp=or}} in a remote desert town in the [[Algerian Desert]] called [[Bou Bernous]] with an elevation of {{convert|378|m|ft}} above sea level.&lt;ref name="books.google.fr"/&gt; It is the world’s highest recorded average high temperature{{Clarify|reason=Average over what time period?|date=April 2017}} and only [[Death Valley, California]] rivals it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffiths|first1=John F.|last2=Driscoll|first2=Dennis M.|title=Survey of Climatology|publisher=C.E.

Salah, well known in Algeria for its extreme heat, has average high temperatures of {{convert|43.8|C|F|1|disp=or}}, {{convert|46.4|C|F|1|disp=or}}, {{convert|45.5|C|F|1|disp=or}} and {{convert|41.9|C|F|1|disp=or}} in June, July, August and September respectively. There are even hotter spots in the Sahara, but they are located in extremely remote areas, especially in the [[Azalai]], lying in northern Mali. The major part of the desert experiences around three to five months when the average high strictly exceeds {{convert|40|C|F|disp=or}}. The southern central part of the desert experiences up to six or seven months when the average high temperature strictly exceeds {{convert|40|C|F|disp=or}} which shows the constancy and the length of the really hot season in the Sahara. Some examples of this are: [[Bilma]], Niger and Faya-Largeau, Chad. The annual average daily temperature exceeds {{convert|20|C|F|disp=or}} everywhere and can approach {{convert|30|C|F|disp=or}} in the hottest regions year-round. However, most of the desert has a value in excess of {{convert|25|C|F|disp=or}}.

Sand and ground temperatures are even more extreme. During daytime, the sand temperature is extremely high as it can easily reach {{convert|80|C|F|disp=or}} or more.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicholson|first1=Sharon E.|title=Dryland Climatology|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139500241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqussIGJ0NcC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=Port-Sudan+84+%C2%B0C&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DUklVfD6HY3gaqy0gZAH&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Port-Sudan%2084%20%C2%B0C&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sand temperature of 83.5&amp;nbsp;°C (182.3&amp;nbsp;°F) has been recorded in [[Port Sudan]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Ground temperatures of {{convert|72|C|F|1|disp=or}} have been recorded in the [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar of Mauritania]] and a value of 75&amp;nbsp;°C (167&amp;nbsp;°F) has been measured in [[Borkou]], northern Chad.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Due to lack of cloud cover and very low humidity, the desert usually features high diurnal temperature variations between days and nights. However, it is a myth that the nights are cold after extremely hot days in the Sahara. The average diurnal temperature range is typically between {{convert|13|and|20|C-change|F-change|1|disp=or}}. The lowest values are found along the coastal regions due to high humidity and are often even lower than {{convert|10|C-change|F-change|disp=or}}, while the highest values are found in inland desert areas where the humidity is the lowest, mainly in the southern Sahara. Still, it is true that winter nights can be cold as it can drop to the freezing point and even below, especially in high-elevation areas. The frequency of subfreezing winter nights in the Sahara is strongly influenced by the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]] (NAO), with warmer winter temperatures during negative NAO events and cooler winters with more frosts when the NAO is positive.&lt;ref&gt;See Visbeck, Martin H.; Hurrell, James W.; Polvani, Lorenzo and Cullen, Heidi M.; ‘The North Atlantic Oscillation: Past, Present, and Future’; ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', vol. 98, no. 23 (2001); pp. 12876-12877&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the weaker clockwise flow around the eastern side of the subtropical anticyclone during negative NAO winters, although too dry to produce more than negligible precipitation, does reduce the flow of dry, cold air from higher latitudes of Eurasia into the Sahara significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Hurrell, James W.; Kushnir, Yochanan; Ottersen, Geir and Visbeck, Martin; ''An Overview of the North Atlantic Oscillation'', pp. 17-19. Geophysical Monograph 134; published 2003 by the American Geophysical Union&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precipitation===
The average annual rainfall ranges from very low in the northern and southern fringes of the desert to nearly non-existent over the central and the eastern part. The thin northern fringe of the desert receives more winter cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of [[low pressure system]]s over the Mediterranean Sea along the polar front, although very attenuated by the rain shadow effects of the mountains and the annual average rainfall ranges from {{convert|100|mm|in|0}} to {{convert|250|mm|in|0}}. For example, [[Biskra]], Algeria and [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco are found in this zone. The southern fringe of the desert along the border with the Sahel receives summer cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of the Intertropical Convergence Zone from the south and the annual average rainfall ranges from {{convert|100|mm|in|0}} to {{convert|250|mm|in|0}}. For example, Timbuktu, Mali and [[Agadez]], Niger are found in this zone. The vast central hyper-arid core of the desert is virtually never affected by northerly or southerly atmospheric disturbances and permanently remains under the influence of the strongest anticyclonic weather regime, and the annual average rainfall can drop to less than {{convert|1|mm|in|2}}. In fact, most of the Sahara receives less than {{convert|20|mm|in|1}}.

=== Desertification and prehistoric climate===
{{Main|Sahara pump theory|Green Sahara|Prehistoric North Africa|North African climate cycles}}
The climate of the Sahara has undergone enormous variations between wet and dry over the last few hundred thousand years,&lt;ref name="Lakes"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Ancient Lakes of the Sahara | publisher=American Scientist | volume=94 | year=2006 | pages= 58–65 |author1=Kevin White  |author2=David J. Mattingly | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed to be caused by long-term changes in the [[North African climate cycle]] that alters the path of the [[North African Monsoon]] - usually southward. The cycle is caused by a 41000-year cycle in which the tilt of the earth changes between 22° and 24.5°.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Orbit: Earth's Extraordinary Journey documentary&lt;/ref&gt; At present (2000 AD), we are in a dry period, but it is expected that the Sahara will become green again in 15000 years (17000 AD). When the North African monsoon is at its strongest annual precipitation and subsequent vegetation in the Sahara region increase, resulting in conditions commonly referred to as the "[[green Sahara]]". For a relatively weak North African monsoon, the opposite is true, with decreased annual precipitation and less vegetation resulting in a phase of the Sahara climate cycle known as the "desert Sahara".&lt;ref name="Foley1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Foley |first1=Jonathan A. |last2=Coe |first2=Michael T. |last3=Scheffer |first3=Marten |last4=Wang |first4=Guiling |title=Regime Shifts in the Sahara and Sahel: Interactions between Ecological and Climatic Systems in Northern Africa |journal=Ecosystems |date=1 October 2003 |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=524–539 |doi=10.1007/s10021-002-0227-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that changes in [[insolation]] (solar heating) caused by long-term changes in the Earth's orbit are a controlling factor for the long-term variations in the strength of monsoon patterns across the globe was first suggested by Rudolf Spitaler in the late nineteenth century,&lt;ref name="Ruddiman3"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ruddiman |first1=William F. |title=Earth's Climate: Past and Future |date=2001 |publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company |location=New York, NY |isbn=9780716737414}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis was later formally proposed and tested by the meteorologist John Kutzbach in 1981.&lt;ref name="Kutzbach4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kutzbach |first1=J.E. |title=Monsoon Climate of the Early Holocene: Climate Experiment with the Earth's Orbital Parameters for 9000 Years Ago |journal=Science |date=2 October 1981 |volume=214 |issue=4516 |pages=59–61 |doi=10.1126/science.214.4516.59|pmid=17802573 |bibcode=1981Sci...214...59K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kutzbach's ideas about the impacts of insolation on global monsoonal patterns have become widely accepted today as the underlying driver of long term monsoonal cycles. Kutzbach never formally named his hypothesis and as such it is referred to here as the "Orbital Monsoon Hypothesis" as suggested by Ruddiman in 2001.&lt;ref name="Ruddiman3" /&gt;

During the last [[glacial period]], the Sahara was much larger than it is today, extending south beyond its current boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Ehret. ''The Civilizations of Africa.'' University Press of Virginia, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  The end of the glacial period brought more rain to the Sahara, from about 8000 BC to 6000 BC, perhaps because of [[low pressure area]]s over the collapsing [[ice sheet]]s to the north.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/~e118/Fezzan/fezzan_palaeoclim.html Fezzan Project&amp;nbsp;— Palaeoclimate and environment].

In the southern Sahara, the drying trend was initially counteracted by the [[monsoon]], which brought rain further north than it does today. By around 4200 BC, however, the monsoon retreated south to approximately where it is today,&lt;ref name = "Science Daily"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990712080500.htm Sahara's Abrupt Desertification Started by Changes in Earth's Orbit], Accelerated by Atmospheric and Vegetation Feedbacks.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the gradual [[desertification]] of the Sahara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kröpelin | first = Stefan | authorlink = Stefan Kröpelin | year = 2008 | title = Climate-Driven Ecosystem Succession in the Sahara: The Past 6000 Years | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5877 | pages = 765–768 | doi = 10.1126/science.1154913 | url = http://www.neu.uni-bayreuth.de/de/Uni_Bayreuth/Fakultaeten/2_Biologie_Chemie_und_Geowissenschaften/geowissenschaften/geomorphologie/de/ressourcen/docs_suchodoletz/Kroepelinetal_2008.pdf| accessdate = | quote =| pmid = 18467583 |display-authors=etal| bibcode = 2008Sci...320..765K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sahara is now as dry as it was about 13,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Lakes/&gt;

The [[Sahara pump theory]] describes this cycle. During periods of a wet or "[[Green Sahara]]", the Sahara becomes a [[savanna]] grassland and various flora and fauna become more common. Following inter-pluvial arid periods, the Sahara area then reverts to desert conditions and the flora and fauna are forced to retreat northwards to the [[Atlas Mountains]], southwards into [[West Africa]], or eastwards into the [[Nile Valley]]. This separates [[population]]s of some of the species in areas with different [[climate]]s, forcing them to [[adaptation|adapt]], possibly giving rise to [[allopatric speciation]].

It is also proposed that humans accelerated the drying out period from 6,000–2,500 BC by pastoralists overgrazing available grassland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-really-turned-sahara-desert-green-oasis-wasteland-180962668/|title=What Really Turned the Sahara Desert From a Green Oasis Into a Wasteland?|last=Boissoneault|first=Lorraine|date=2017-03-24|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evidence for cycles ====
The growth of [[speleothems]] (which requires rainwater) was detected in Hol-Zakh, Ashalim, Even-Sid, Ma'ale-ha-Meyshar, Ktora Cracks, Nagev Tzavoa Cave, and elsewhere, and has allowing tracking of prehistoric rainfall. The Red Sea coastal route was extremely arid before 140 and after 115 kya. Slightly wetter conditions appear at 90–87 kya, but it still was just one tenth the rainfall around 125 kya. In the southern [[Negev Desert]] speleothems did not grow between 185–140 kya ([[Marine isotope stage|MIS]] 6), 110–90 (MIS 5.4–5.2), nor after 85 kya nor during most of the interglacial period (MIS 5.1), the glacial period and [[Holocene]]. This suggests that the southern Negev was arid to hyper-arid in these periods.&lt;ref name=Vaks2007&gt;{{Cite journal

During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM) the Sahara desert was more extensive than it is now with the extent of the tropical forests being greatly reduced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercAFRICA.html |title=Africa during the last 150,000 years |first=Jonathan |last=Adams |publisher=Environmental Sciences Division, [[ORNL]] Oak Ridge National Laboratory |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501225402/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/nercAFRICA.html |archivedate=2006-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the lower temperatures reduced the strength of the [[Hadley Cell]]. This is a climate cell which causes rising tropical air of the [[Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) to bring rain to the tropics, while dry descending air, at about [[20th parallel north|20 degrees north]], flows back to the equator and brings desert conditions to this region. It is associated with high rates of wind-blown mineral dust, and these dust levels are found as expected in marine cores from the north tropical Atlantic. But around 12,500 BC the amount of dust in the cores in the [[Bølling Oscillation|Bølling]]/[[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød]] phase suddenly plummets and shows a period of much wetter conditions in the Sahara, indicating a [[Dansgaard-Oeschger event|Dansgaard-Oeschger]] (DO) event (a sudden warming followed by a slower cooling of the climate).  The moister Saharan conditions had begun about 12,500 BC, with the extension of the ITCZ northward in the northern hemisphere summer, bringing moist wet conditions and a savanna climate to the Sahara, which (apart from a short dry spell associated with the [[Younger Dryas]]) peaked during the [[Holocene thermal maximum]] climatic phase at 4000 BC when mid-latitude temperatures seem to have been between 2 and 3 degrees warmer than in the recent past.  Analysis of [[Nile River]] deposited sediments in the delta also shows this period had a higher proportion of sediments coming from the [[Blue Nile]], suggesting higher rainfall also in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]].  This was caused principally by a stronger [[monsoon]]al circulation throughout the sub-tropical regions, affecting India, Arabia and the Sahara.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} [[Lake Victoria]] only recently became the source of the [[White Nile]] and dried out almost completely around 15 kya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The sudden subsequent movement of the ITCZ southwards with a [[Heinrich event]] (a sudden cooling followed by a slower warming), linked to changes with the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] cycle, led to a rapid drying out of the Saharan and Arabian regions, which quickly became desert. This is linked to a marked decline in the scale of the Nile floods between 2700 and 2100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, William J. (2007) "Climate Change in Prehistory: the end of the reign of chaos" (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecoregions==
[[File:Saharan topographic elements map.png|thumb|upright=1.75|The major topographic features of the Saharan region]]

The Sahara comprises several distinct [[ecoregion]]s. With their variations in temperature, rainfall, elevation, and soil, these regions harbor distinct communities of plants and animals.

The '''[[Atlantic coastal desert]]''' is a narrow strip along the Atlantic coast where fog generated offshore by the cool [[Canary Current]] provides sufficient moisture to sustain a variety of [[lichen]]s, [[succulent plant|succulents]], and shrubs. It covers an area of {{convert|39,900|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} in the south of Morocco and Mauritania.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1304|name=Atlantic coastal desert|accessdate=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[North Saharan steppe and woodlands]]''' is along the northern desert, next to the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] ecoregions of the northern Maghreb and Cyrenaica. Winter rains sustain shrublands and dry woodlands that form a transition between the Mediterranean climate regions to the north and the hyper-arid Sahara proper to the south. It covers {{convert|1,675,300|km2|sqmi|sp=us|sigfig=5}} in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1321|name=North Saharan steppe and woodlands|accessdate=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Sahara Desert (ecoregion)|Sahara Desert ecoregion]]''' covers the hyper-arid central portion of the Sahara where rainfall is minimal and sporadic. Vegetation is rare, and this ecoregion consists mostly of sand dunes (''erg, chech, raoui''), stone plateaus (''hamadas''), gravel plains (''reg''), dry valleys (''wadis''), and salt flats. It covers {{convert|4639900|km2|sqmi}} of: Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Sudan.&lt;ref name=PA1327/&gt;

The '''[[South Saharan steppe and woodlands]]''' ecoregion is a narrow band running east and west between the hyper-arid Sahara and the Sahel savannas to the south. Movements of the equatorial Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) bring summer rains during July and August which average {{convert|100|to|200|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=1|in}} but vary greatly from year to year. These rains sustain summer pastures of grasses and herbs, with dry woodlands and shrublands along seasonal watercourses. This ecoregion covers {{convert|1101700|km2|sqmi}} in Algeria, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1329|name=South Saharan steppe and woodlands|accessdate=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''[[West Saharan montane xeric woodlands]]''', several volcanic highlands provide a cooler, moister environment that supports Saharo-Mediterranean woodlands and shrublands. The ecoregion covers {{convert|258100|km2|sqmi|sigfig=4}}, mostly in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] of Algeria, with smaller enclaves in the Aïr of Niger, the [[Dhar Adrar]] of Mauritania, and the Adrar des Iforas of Mali and Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1332|name=West Saharan montane xeric woodlands|accessdate=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands]]''' ecoregion consists of the Tibesti and [[Jebel Uweinat]] highlands. Higher and more regular rainfall and cooler temperatures support woodlands and shrublands of Date palm, [[acacia]]s, [[Myrtus|myrtle]], [[oleander]], [[tamarix]], and several rare and endemic plants. The ecoregion covers {{convert|82,200|km2|sqmi}} in the Tibesti of Chad and Libya, and Jebel Uweinat on the border of Egypt, Libya, and Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1331|name=Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands|accessdate=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Saharan halophytics''' is an area of seasonally flooded saline depressions which is home to [[halophytic]] (salt-adapted) plant communities. The Saharan halophytics cover {{convert|54,000|km2|sqmi}} including: the [[Qattara Depression|Qattara]] and [[Siwa Depression|Siwa]] depressions in northern Egypt, the [[Tunisian salt lakes]] of central Tunisia, [[Chott Melghir]] in Algeria, and smaller areas of Algeria, Mauritania, and the southern part of Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0905|name=Saharan halophytics|accessdate=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Tanezrouft]]''' is one of the harshest regions on Earth as well as one of the hottest and driest parts of the Sahara, with no vegetation and very little life. It is along the borders of Algeria, Niger, and Mali, west of the [[Ahaggar Mountains|Hoggar]] mountains.

==Flora and fauna==
The flora of the Sahara is highly diversified based on the bio-geographical characteristics of this vast desert. [[Floristics|Floristically]], the Sahara has three zones based on the amount of rainfall received – the Northern (Mediterranean), Central and Southern Zones. There are two transitional zones – the Mediterranean-Sahara transition and the Sahel transition zone.&lt;ref name="Mares1999"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Mares, Michael A.|title=Encyclopedia of Deserts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3CbqZtaF4oC&amp;pg=PA490|year=1999|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3146-7|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saharan flora comprises around 2800 species of [[vascular plant]]s. Approximately a quarter of these are [[endemism|endemic]]. About half of these species are common to the flora of the Arabian deserts.&lt;ref name="Houérou2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Houérou|first=Henry N.|title=Bioclimatology and Biogeography of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Rvs7NkfeLEC&amp;pg=PA82|year= 2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-85192-9|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central Sahara is estimated to include five hundred species of plants, which is extremely low considering the huge extent of the area. Plants such as acacia trees, palms, succulents, spiny shrubs, and grasses have adapted to the arid conditions, by growing lower to avoid water loss by strong winds, by storing water in their thick stems to use it in dry periods, by having long roots that travel horizontally to reach the maximum area of water and to find any surface moisture, and by having small thick leaves or needles to prevent water loss by [[evapotranspiration]]. Plant leaves may dry out totally and then recover.

[[File:GueltaCamels.jpg|thumb|Camels in the [[Guelta d'Archei]], in north-eastern [[Chad]]]]
Several species of fox live in the Sahara including: the [[fennec fox]], [[pale fox]] and [[Rüppell's fox]]. The [[addax]], a large white [[antelope]], can go nearly a year in the desert without drinking. The [[dorcas gazelle]] is a north African gazelle that can also go for a long time without water. Other notable gazelles include the [[rhim gazelle]] and [[dama gazelle]].

The Saharan [[cheetah]] ([[northwest African cheetah]]) lives in Algeria, [[Togo]], Niger, Mali, [[Benin]], and [[Burkina Faso]]. There remain fewer than 250 mature cheetahs, which are very cautious, fleeing any human presence. The cheetah avoids the sun from April to October, seeking the shelter of shrubs such as [[balanites]] and acacias. They are unusually pale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7905986.stm |title= Rare cheetah captured on camera |publisher=BBC News |date=24 February 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/221/0|title=Acinonyx jubatus ssp. hecki (Northwest African Cheetah, Saharan Cheetah)|website=oldredlist.iucnredlist.org|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other cheetah subspecies ([[northeast African cheetah]]) lives in Chad, Sudan and the eastern region of Niger. However, it is currently extinct in the wild in Egypt and Libya. There are approximately 2000 mature individuals left in the wild.

Other animals exist in the Sahara (birds in particular) such as [[African silverbill]] and [[black-faced firefinch]], among others. There are also small [[desert crocodile]]s in Mauritania and the [[Ennedi Plateau]] of Chad.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/06/0617_020618_croc.html Desert-Adapted Crocs Found in Africa]", National Geographic News, 18 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[deathstalker]] scorpion can be {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. Its venom contains large amounts of [[agitoxin]] and [[scyllatoxin]] and is very dangerous; however, a sting from this scorpion rarely kills a healthy adult. The [[Saharan silver ant]] is unique in that due to the extreme high temperatures of their habitat, and the threat of predators, the ants are active outside their nest for only about ten minutes per day.&lt;ref name="WehnerEtAl1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wehner |first1=R. |last2=Marsh |first2=A.

[[Dromedary]] camels and [[goat]]s are the domesticated animals most commonly found in the Sahara. Because of its qualities of endurance and speed, the dromedary is the favourite animal used by [[nomad]]s.

Human activities are more likely to affect the habitat in areas of permanent water (oases) or where water comes close to the surface. Here, the local pressure on natural resources can be intense. The remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation. In recent years development projects have started in the deserts of Algeria and Tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers. These schemes often lead to soil degradation and [[Soil salinity|salinization]].

Researchers from [[Hacettepe University]] (Yücekutlu, N. et al., 2011) have reported that Saharan soil may have bio-available iron and also some essential macro and micro nutrient elements suitable for use as fertilizer for growing wheat.&lt;ref name=YTSB2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yücekutlu|first1=Nihal|last2=Terzioğlu|first2=Serpil|last3=Saydam|first3=Cemal|last4=Bildacı|first4=Işık|title=Organic Farming By Using Saharan Soil: Could It Be An Alternative To Fertilizers?|journal=Hacettepe Journal of Biology and Chemistry|date=2011|volume=39|issue=1|pages=29–38|url=http://www.hjbc.hacettepe.edu.tr/journal/volume-39/issue-1/HJBC_39_1_29-38.pdf|accessdate=23 March 2015}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Sahara, though, is not lush in vegetation, except in the [[Nile]] Valley, at a few [[oasis|oases]], and in the northern highlands, where Mediterranean plants such as the [[olive]] tree are found to grow. It was long believed that the region had been this way since about 1600 BCE, after shifts in the [[axial tilt|Earth's axis]] increased temperatures and decreased precipitation, which led to the abrupt desertification of North Africa about 5,400 years ago.&lt;ref name = "Science Daily"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990712080500.htm Sahara's Abrupt Desertification Started by Changes in Earth's Orbit], Accelerated by Atmospheric and Vegetation Feedbacks.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this theory has recently been called into dispute, when samples taken from several 7 million year old sand deposits led scientists to reconsider the timeline for desertification.&lt;ref name = "Nature Publishing Group"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v513/n7518/full/nature13705.html Aridification of the Sahara desert caused by Tethys Sea shrinkage during the Late Miocene].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kiffians===
The [[Kiffian culture]] is a prehistoric industry, or domain, that existed between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago in the Sahara, during the [[Neolithic Subpluvial]]. Human remains from this culture were found in 2000 at a site known as [[Gobero]], located in [[Niger]] in the [[Ténéré|Ténéré Desert]].&lt;ref name="scidaily"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080815101317.htm | title = Stone Age Graveyard Reveals Lifestyles Of A 'Green Sahara' | publisher = Science Daily | date = 2008-08-15 | accessdate = 2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is known as the largest and earliest grave of Stone Age people in the Sahara desert.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/15/science/15sahara.html | title = Graves Found From Sahara's Green Period | first = John Noble | last = Wilford | publisher = New York Times | date = 2008-08-14 | accessdate = 2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kiffians were skilled [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters]]. Bones of many large savannah animals that were discovered in the same area suggest that they lived on the shores of a lake that was present during the Holocene Wet Phase, a period when the Sahara was verdant and wet.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; The Kiffian people were tall, standing over six feet in height.&lt;ref name="scidaily" /&gt; Craniometric analysis indicates that this early [[Holocene]] population was closely related to the Late Pleistocene [[Iberomaurusian]]s and early Holocene [[Capsian culture|Capsians]] of the Maghreb, as well as mid-Holocene [[Mechta-Afalou|Mechta]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sereno PC, ((Garcea EAA)), Jousse H, Stojanowski CM, ((Saliège J-F)), Maga A|title=Lakeside Cemeteries in the Sahara: 5000 Years of Holocene Population and Environmental Change|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2008|volume=3|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002995|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0002995.PDF|accessdate=5 May 2016|display-authors=etal|pmid=18701936|pmc=2515196|pages=e2995|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2995S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of the Kiffian culture do not exist after 8,000 years ago, as the Sahara went through a dry period for the next thousand years.&lt;ref name="newscientist"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14536-stone-age-mass-graves-reveal-green-sahara.html?DCMP=ILC-hmts&amp;nsref=news3_head_dn14536 | title = Stone Age mass graves reveal green Sahara | first = Nora | last = Schultz | publisher = New Scientist | date = 2008-08-14 | accessdate = 2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this time, the [[Tenerian culture]] colonized the area.

===Tenerians===
Gobero was discovered in 2000 during an archaeological expedition led by [[Paul Sereno]], which sought [[dinosaur]] remains. Two distinct prehistoric cultures were discovered at the site: the early [[Holocene]] Kiffian culture, and the middle Holocene [[Tenerian culture]]. The Kiffians were a prehistoric people who preceded the Tenerians and vanished approximately 8000 years ago, when the desert became very dry. The desiccation lasted until around 4600 BC, when the earliest artefacts associated with the Tenerians have been dated to. Some 200 skeletons have been discovered at Gobero. The Tenerians were considerably shorter in height and less robust than the earlier Kiffians. Craniometric analysis also indicates that they were osteologically distinct. The Kiffian skulls are akin to those of the [[Late Pleistocene]] [[Iberomaurusian]]s, early Holocene [[Capsian culture|Capsians]], and mid-Holocene [[Mechta-Afalou|Mechta]] groups, whereas the Tenerian crania are more like those of Mediterranean groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sereno PC, Garcea EAA, Jousse H, Stojanowski CM, Saliège J-F, Maga A|title=Lakeside Cemeteries in the Sahara: 5000 Years of Holocene Population and Environmental Change|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2008|volume=3|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002995|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0002995.PDF|accessdate=8 May 2016|display-authors=etal|pmid=18701936|pmc=2515196|pages=e2995|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2995S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilford|first1=John Noble|title=In the Sahara, Stone Age graves from greener days|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/14/health/14iht-15sahara.15304361.html?_r=0|accessdate=10 June 2016|agency=New York Times|date=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graves show that the Tenerians observed spiritual traditions, as they were buried with artifacts such as jewelry made of hippo [[tusk]]s and clay pots. The most interesting find is a triple burial, dated to 5300 years ago, of an adult female and two children, estimated through their teeth as being five and eight years old, hugging each other. Pollen residue indicates they were buried on a bed of flowers. The three are assumed to have died within 24 hours of each other, but as their skeletons hold no apparent trauma (they did not die violently) and they have been buried so elaborately - unlikely if they had died of a plague - the cause of their deaths is a mystery.

===Tashwinat Mummy===
[[Uan Muhuggiag]] appears to have been inhabited from at least the 6th millennium BC to about 2700 BC, although not necessarily continuously.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Mori, F. (1998). The Great Civilisations of the ancient Sahara: Neolithisation and the earliest evidence of anthropomorphic religions. Rome: L'Erma di Bretschneider&lt;/ref&gt; The most noteworthy find at Uan Muhuggiag is the well-preserved [[mummy]] of a young boy of approximately 2 1/2 years old. The child was in a fetal position, then embalmed, then placed in a sack made of antelope skin, which was insulated by a layer of leaves.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The boy's organs were removed, as evidenced by incisions in his stomach and thorax, and an organic preservative was inserted to stop his body from decomposing.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; An ostrich eggshell necklace was also found around his neck.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating]] determined the age of the mummy to be approximately 5600 years old, which makes it about 1000 years older than the earliest previously recorded mummy in ancient [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1958-1959, an archaeological expedition led by Antonio Ascenzi conducted anthropological, radiological, histological and chemical analyses on the Uan Muhuggiag mummy. The specimen was determined to be that of a 30-month old child of uncertain sex, who possessed [[Negroid]] features. A long incision on the specimen's abdominal wall also indicated that the body had been initially mummified by evisceration and later underwent natural desiccation.&lt;ref name="Giuffra2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=V. Giuffra et al.|title=Antonio Ascenzi (1915-2000), a Pathologist devoted  to Anthropology and Paleopathology|journal=Pathologica|date=2010|volume=102|pages=1–5|url=http://www.pathologica.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PATHOLOGICA_1-10.pdf#9|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One other individual, an adult, was found at Uan Muhuggiag, buried in a crouched position.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the body showed no evidence of evisceration or any other method of preservation. The body was estimated to date from about 7500 BP.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Soukopova, J. (2012). Round Heads: The Earliest Rock Paintings in the Sahara.

===Nubians===
{{further|Sahara pump theory|Neolithic Subpluvial}}
[[File:Beni-Izguen.jpg|thumb|[[M'zab|Beni Isguen]], a holy city surrounded by thick walls in the Algerian Sahara]]
During the [[Neolithic]] Era, before the onset of [[desertification]] around 9500 BCE, the central Sudan had been a rich environment supporting a large population ranging across what is now barren desert, like the Wadi el-Qa'ab. By the 5th millennium BCE, the people who inhabited what is now called [[Nubia]], were full participants in the "agricultural revolution", living a settled lifestyle with domesticated plants and animals. Saharan rock art of cattle and herdsmen suggests the presence of a [[cattle cult]] like those found in Sudan and other pastoral societies in Africa today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/faculty/stsmith/research/nubia_history.html |title=History of Nubia |publisher=Anth.ucsb.edu |accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Megalith]]s found at [[Nabta Playa]] are overt examples of probably the world's first known [[archaeoastronomy]] devices, predating [[Stonehenge]] by some 2,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130725174732/http://www.planetquest.org/learn/nabta.html The History of Astronomy]. PlanetQuest&lt;/ref&gt; This complexity, as observed at Nabta Playa, and as expressed by different levels of authority within the society there, likely formed the basis for the structure of both the Neolithic society at Nabta and the Old Kingdom of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Wendorf, Fred (1998) [https://web.archive.org/web/20101009235228/http://www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html Late Neolithic megalithic structures at Nabta Playa].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptians===
By 6000 BCE [[predynastic Egypt]]ians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were herding cattle and constructing large buildings. Subsistence in organized and permanent settlements in predynastic Egypt by the middle of the 6th millennium BCE centered predominantly on cereal and animal agriculture: cattle, goats, pigs and sheep. Metal objects replaced prior ones of stone. Tanning of animal skins, pottery and weaving were commonplace in this era also. There are indications of seasonal or only temporary occupation of the [[Al Fayyum]] in the 6th millennium BCE, with food activities centering on fishing, hunting and food-gathering. Stone [[arrowhead]]s, knives and scrapers from the era are commonly found.&lt;ref name= Fayum&gt;[http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/fayum/fayumb.html Fayum, Qarunian] (Fayum B, about 6000–5000 BCE?), [http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk Digital Egypt].&lt;/ref&gt; Burial items included pottery, jewelry, farming and hunting equipment, and assorted foods including dried meat and fruit. Burial in desert environments appears to enhance Egyptian preservation rites, and the dead were buried facing due west.&lt;ref name= Predynastic&gt;Predynastic (5,500–3,100 BCE), Tour Egypt.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 3400 BCE, the Sahara was as dry as it is today, due to reduced precipitation and higher temperatures resulting from a shift in the Earth's orbit.&lt;ref name = "Science Daily"/&gt; As a result of this aridification, it became a largely impenetrable barrier to humans, with the remaining settlements mainly being concentrated around the numerous oases that dot the landscape. Little trade or commerce is known to have passed through the interior in subsequent periods, the only major exception being the Nile Valley. The Nile, however, was impassable at several [[Cataracts of the Nile|cataracts]], making trade and contact by boat difficult.

===Phoenicians===
{{Further|History of Western Sahara}}

The people of [[Phoenicia]], who flourished from 1200–800 BCE, created a confederation of kingdoms across the entire Sahara to Egypt. They generally settled along the Mediterranean coast, as well as the Sahara, among the people of [[ancient Libya]], who were the ancestors of people who speak [[Berber languages]] in North Africa and the Sahara today, including the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] of the central Sahara.
[[File:Bilma-Salzkarawane1.jpg|thumb|[[Azalai]] salt caravan. The French reported that the 1906 caravan numbered 20,000 camels.]]
The Phoenician alphabet seems to have been adopted by the ancient Libyans of north Africa, and [[Tifinagh]] is still used today by Berber-speaking Tuareg camel herders of the central Sahara.

Sometime between 633 BCE and 530 BCE, [[Hanno the Navigator]] either established or reinforced Phoenician colonies in Western Sahara, but all ancient remains have vanished with virtually no trace.

===Greeks===
By 500 BCE, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] arrived in the desert. Greek traders spread along the eastern coast of the desert, establishing trading colonies along the [[Red Sea]]. The [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] explored the Atlantic coast of the desert, but the turbulence of the waters and the lack of markets caused a lack of presence further south than modern Morocco. Centralized states thus surrounded the desert on the north and east; it remained outside the control of these states. Raids from the nomadic Berber people of the desert were of constant concern to those living on the edge of the desert.

===Urban civilization===
[[File:Ghardaia01.jpg|thumb|Market on the main square of [[Ghardaïa]] (1971)]]

An urban civilization, the [[Garamantes]], arose around 500 BCE in the heart of the Sahara, in a valley that is now called the [[Wadi al-Ajal]] in [[Fezzan]], Libya.&lt;ref name="Lakes"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Ancient Lakes of the Sahara | publisher=American Scientist | volume=94 | year=2006 | pages= 58–65 |author1=Kevin White  |author2=David J. Mattingly  |lastauthoramp=yes | issue=1 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Garamantes achieved this development by digging tunnels far into the mountains flanking the valley to tap [[fossil water]] and bring it to their fields. The Garamantes grew populous and strong, conquering their neighbors and capturing many slaves (who were put to work extending the tunnels). The ancient Greeks and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] knew of the Garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads. However, they traded with them, and a [[Roman bath]] has been found in the Garamantes' capital of Garama. [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] have found eight major towns and many other important settlements in the Garamantes' territory. The Garamantes' civilization eventually collapsed after they had depleted available water in the [[aquifer]]s and could no longer sustain the effort to extend the tunnels further into the mountains.&lt;ref name = "Keys"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Keys, David|year= 2004|title= Kingdom of the Sands|magazine=Archaeology|volume= 57 |issue= 2|url=http://www.archaeology.org/0403/abstracts/sands.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berbers===
[[File:Marabutto-Taghirt.JPG|thumb|[[Zawiya (institution)|Zawiya]] at the entrance of [[Taghit]], Algeria ]]
The [[Berber people]] occupied (and still occupy with Arabs) much of the Sahara. The Garamantes Berbers built a prosperous empire in the heart of the desert.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly et al. (2003). ''Archaeology of Fazzan'', Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Tuareg nomads continue to inhabit and move across wide Sahara surfaces to the present day.

===Islamic and Arabic expansion===
{{Main|Trans-Saharan trade|Islamization of Sudan}}

The [[Byzantine Empire]] ruled the northern shores of the Sahara from the 5th to the 7th centuries. After the Muslim conquest of Arabia, specifically the Arabian peninsula, the [[Muslim conquest of North Africa]] began in the mid-7th to early 8th centuries and Islamic influence expanded rapidly on the Sahara. By the end of 641 all of Egypt was in Muslim hands. Trade across the desert intensified, and a significant [[slave trade]] crossed the desert. It has been estimated that from the 10th to 19th centuries some 6,000 to 7,000 slaves were transported north each year.&lt;ref&gt;Fage, J.D. (2001) ''A History of Africa''. Routledge, 4th ed. {{ISBN|0415252482}}. p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hoggar caravane2.jpg|thumb|The [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] once controlled the central Sahara and its trade.]]

===Ottoman Turkish era===
In the 16th century the northern fringe of the Sahara, such as coastal regencies in present-day [[Ottoman Algeria|Algeria]] and Tunisia, as well as some parts of present-day Libya, together with the semi-autonomous kingdom of Egypt, were occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. From 1517 Egypt was a valued part of the Ottoman Empire, ownership of which provided the Ottomans with control over the Nile Valley, the east Mediterranean and North Africa. The benefit of the Ottoman Empire was the freedom of movement for citizens and goods. Traders exploited the Ottoman land routes to handle the spices, gold and silk from the East, manufactured goods from Europe, and the slave and gold traffic from Africa. Arabic continued as the local language and Islamic culture was much reinforced. The Sahel and southern Sahara regions were home to several independent states or to roaming Tuareg clans.

===European colonialism===
[[European colonialism]] in the Sahara began in the 19th century. [[July Monarchy|France]] conquered the regency of Algiers from the Ottomans in 1830, and French rule spread south from Algeria and eastwards from [[Senegal]] into the upper [[Niger River|Niger]] to include present-day Algeria, Chad, Mali then [[French Sudan]] including Timbuktu, Mauritania, Morocco (1912), Niger, and Tunisia (1881). By the beginning of the 20th century, the trans-Saharan trade had clearly declined because goods were moved through more modern and efficient means, such as airplanes, rather than across the desert.&lt;ref&gt;Trans-Saharan Africa in World History, Ch. 6, Ralph Austin&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Colonial Empire was the dominant presence in the Sahara. It established regular air links from [[Toulouse]] (HQ of famed [[Aéropostale (aviation)|Aéropostale]]), to [[Oran]] and over the [[Hoggar]] to Timbuktu and West to [[Bamako]] and [[Dakar]], as well as trans-Sahara bus services run by La Companie Transsaharienne (est. 1927).&lt;ref name=wauthier1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://saharayro.free.fr/fwauthier1.htm | title = Wauthier Bréard 1933 | accessdate = 22 February 2013 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; A remarkable film shot by famous aviator Captain [[René Wauthier]] documents the first crossing by a large truck convoy from Algiers to Tchad, across the Sahara.&lt;ref name=Reconnaissance_saharienne&gt;{{cite web|last=Wauthier|first=René|title=Reconnaissance saharienne|url=http://www.cnc-aff.fr/internet_cnc/Internet/ARemplir/Fiches/Corpus_Algerie/decouverte/46506.html|work=French Cinema Archives|accessdate=22 February 2013|language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt, under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] and his successors, conquered Nubia in 1820–22, founded [[Khartoum]] in 1823, and conquered [[Darfur]] in 1874. Egypt, including the Sudan, became a British protectorate in 1882. Egypt and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] lost control of the Sudan from 1882 to 1898 as a result of the [[Mahdist War]]. After its capture by British troops in 1898, the Sudan became an Anglo-Egyptian [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].

[[Restoration (Spain)|Spain]] captured present-day [[Western Sahara]] after 1874, although Rio del Oro remained largely under [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] influence. In 1912, [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] captured parts of what was to be named [[Ottoman Libya|Libya]] from the Ottomans. To promote the [[Roman Catholic]] religion in the desert, [[Pope Pius IX]] appointed a delegate Apostolic of the Sahara and the Sudan in 1868; later in the 19th century his jurisdiction was reorganized into the [[Vicariate Apostolic of Sahara]].

===Breakup of the empires and afterwards===
[[File:Libya 5101 Fozzigiaren Arch Tadrart Acacus Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|A natural rock arch in south western Libya]]
[[File:Hoggar Desert (Algerie).jpg|left|thumb|The Sahara today]]

Egypt became independent of Britain in 1936, although the [[Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936]] allowed Britain to keep troops in Egypt and to maintain the British-Egyptian condominium in the Sudan. British military forces were withdrawn in 1954.

Most of the Saharan states achieved independence after [[World War II]]: Libya in 1951; Morocco, Sudan, and Tunisia in 1956; Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger in 1960; and Algeria in 1962. Spain withdrew from Western Sahara in 1975, and it was partitioned between Mauritania and Morocco. Mauritania withdrew in 1979; Morocco continues to hold the territory.

In the post-World War II era, several [[mining|mines]] and communities have developed to utilize the desert's natural resources. These include large deposits of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] in Algeria and Libya, and large deposits of [[phosphate]]s in Morocco and Western Sahara.

A number of [[Trans-African Highway network|Trans-African highways]] have been proposed across the Sahara, including the [[Cairo–Dakar Highway]] along the Atlantic coast, the [[Trans-Sahara Highway]] from [[Algiers]] on the Mediterranean to [[Kano]] in Nigeria, the [[Tripoli – Cape Town Highway]] from [[Tripoli]] in Libya to [[N'Djamena]] in Chad, and the [[Cairo – Cape Town Highway]] which follows the Nile. Each of these highways is partially complete, with significant gaps and unpaved sections.

==People and languages==
[[File:Arabslavers.jpg|thumb|A 19th-century engraving of an Arab [[Arab slave trade|slave-trading]] caravan transporting black African slaves across the Sahara]]

The people of the Sahara are of various origins. Among them the Amaziɣ including the Turūq, various [[Arabized]] Amaziɣ groups such as the [[Hassaniya]]-speaking [[Sahrawis]], whose populations include the [[Znaga]], a tribe whose name is a remnant of the pre-historic [[Zenaga language]]. Other major groups of people include the: [[Toubou]], [[Nubians]], [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Songhai people|Songhai]], [[Beja people|Beja]], and [[Fula people|Fula/Fulani]] ({{lang-fr|Peul}}; {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}).

[[Arabic dialects]] are the most widely spoken languages in the Sahara. Arabic, Berber and its variants now regrouped under the term [[Amazigh]] (which includes the [[Guanche language]] spoken by the original Berber inhabitants of the Canary Islands) and Beja languages are part of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] or [[Hamito-Semitic]] family.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Unlike neighboring [[West Africa]] and the central governments of the states that comprise the Sahara, the French language bears little relevance to inter-personal discourse and commerce within the region, its people retaining staunch ethnic and political affiliations with [[Tuareg]] and [[Berbers|Berber]] leaders and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jane E. Goodman, 2005. ''Berber Culture on the World Stage: From Village to Video''. Indiana University Press, 2010. {{ISBN|978-0253217844}} p. 49-68&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy of the French [[French North Africa|colonial era]] administration is primarily manifested in the territorial reorganization enacted by the [[French Third Republic|Third]] and [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth]] republics, which engendered artificial political divisions within a hitherto isolated and porous region.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph A. Austen. ''Trans-Saharan Africa in World History''. Oxford University Press, 2010. {{ISBN|0199798834}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diplomacy with local clients was conducted primarily in Arabic, which was the traditional language of bureaucratic affairs. Mediation of disputes and inter-agency communication was served by interpreters contracted by the French government, who, according to Keenan, "documented a space of intercultural mediation," contributing much to preserving the indigenous cultural identities in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Keenan, ed. ''The Sahara: Past, Present and Future''. Routledge, 2013. {{ISBN|1317970012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sensitive flame''' is a gas flame which under suitable adjustment of pressure resonates readily with sounds or air vibrations in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F0w1xLYCosYC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=sensitive+flame+%22W.+F.+Barrett%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zTZZ6Keqrs&amp;sig=JR4uTUlLOoS5frTbJeQWtejZdLk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dRHDUcqdN8m4hAfU4oDoAw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=sensitive%20flame%20%22W.%20F.%20Barrett%22&amp;f=false ''Stand and Burner for Sensitive Flames'' - Prof. W. F. Barrett]&lt;/ref&gt; Noticed by both the American scientist [[John LeConte]] and the English physicist [[William Fletcher Barrett]], they recorded the effect that a shrill note had upon a gas flame issuing from a tapering jet. The phenomenon caught the attention of the Irish physicist [[John Tyndall]] who gave a lecture on the process to the [[Royal Institution]] in January 1867.&lt;ref&gt;"Les Recreations Scientifiques" - [[Gaston Tissandier]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PSM V36 D052 Sensitive batwing flames testing light and its effect on sound.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 3]]

While not necessary to observe the effect, a higher flame temperature allows for easier observation. Sounds at lower to mid-range frequencies have little to no effect on the flame. However, shrill noises at high frequencies produce noticeable effects on the flame. Even the ticking of a pocket watch was observed as producing a high enough frequency to affect the flame.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_36/November_1889/Sensitive_Flames_and_Sound-Shadows|title=Sensitive Flames and Sound-Shadows|publisher=''Popular Science''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1719">The '''stellar birthline''' is a predicted line on the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] that relates the [[effective temperature]] and [[luminosity]] of  [[pre-main-sequence]] stars at the start of their contraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Birthline for Low-Mass Stars|last = Stahler, S. W.|date = 1983|journal = Astrophysical Journal |volume=274 |issue= |pages=822|doi = 10.1086/161495|bibcode = 1983ApJ...274..822S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this point, the objects are accreting [[protostar]]s, and are so deeply embedded in the cloud of [[cosmic dust|dust]] and gas from which they are forming that they radiate only in far [[infrared]] and [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter]] wavelengths. Once [[Stellar evolution|stellar winds]] disperse this cloud, the star becomes visible as a [[pre-main-sequence star|pre-main-sequence]] object. The set of locations on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram where these newly visible stars reside is called the ''birthline'', and is found above the [[main sequence]].

The location of the stellar birthline depends in detail on the [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] rate onto the star and geometry of this accretion, i.e. whether or not it is occurring through an [[accretion disk]]. This means that the birthline is not an infinitely thin curve, but has a finite thickness in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.

The '''Stereoautograph''' is a complex opto-mechanical [[measurement]] instrument for the evaluation of analog or digital [[photogram]]s. It is based on the [[stereoscopy]] effect by using two [[Aerial photography|aero photos]] or two photograms of the topography or of buildings from different standpoints.

It was invented by [[Eduard von Orel]]  in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{ÖBL|7|243|244|Orel Eduard von|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photograms or [[photographic plate]]s are oriented by measured [[passpoint]]s in the field or on the building. This procedure can be carried out digitally (by methods of triangulation and [[projective geometry]] or iteratively (repeated angle corrections by congruent rays). The accuracy of modern autographs is about 0.001 mm.

Well known are the instruments of the companies [[Wild Heerbrugg]] (Leica), e.g. analog [[Wild Heerbrugg A7|A7]], [[Wild Heerbrugg B8|B8]] of the 1980s and the digital autographs beginning in the 1990s, or special instruments of [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] and Contraves.

The object has been detected by numerous [[astronomical survey]]s, so has numerous [[astronomical naming conventions#Catalogues|valid source designations]]. The most commonly used, TXS&amp;nbsp;0506+056, comes from its inclusion in the Texas Survey of radio sources (standard abbreviation TXS) and its approximate [[equatorial coordinates]] in the [[equinox (celestial coordinates)|B1950 equinox]] used by that survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Details on Acronym: TXS |url=http://cds.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/Dic-Simbad?/15636609 |website=Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celestial Objects |publisher=[[Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg]] |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1996AJ....111.1945D|doi=10.1086/117932|title=The Texas Survey of Radio Sources Covering -35.5 degrees &lt; declination &lt; 71.5 degrees at 365 MHz|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=111|pages=1945|year=1996|last1=Douglas|first1=James N|last2=Bash|first2=Frank N|last3=Bozyan|first3=F.

The gamma-ray flux from TXS&amp;nbsp;0506+056 is highly variable, by at least a factor of a thousand, but on average it is in the top 4% of brightest gamma-ray sources on the sky.&lt;ref name=padovani2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=IceCube2018b/&gt; It is also very bright in radio waves, in the top 1% of sources.&lt;ref name=padovani2018/&gt; Given its distance, this makes TXS&amp;nbsp;0506+056 one of the most intrinsically powerful [[BL Lac object]]s known, particularly in high-energy gamma rays.&lt;ref name=padovani2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=IceCube2018b/&gt;

==Neutrino emission==
On September 22, 2017, the [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory]] detected a high energy [[muon neutrino]], dubbed '''IceCube-170922A'''.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt; The neutrino carried an energy of ~290 [[Teraelectronvolt|tera–electronvolts]] (TeV); for comparison, the [[Large Hadron Collider]] can generate a maximum energy of 13&amp;nbsp;TeV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Webb |first1=Jonathan |title=LHC smashes collision energy record |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-32809636 |accessdate=21 July 2018 |work=BBC News |date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one minute of the neutrino detection, IceCube sent an automated alert to astronomers around the world with coordinates to search for a possible source.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt;

A search of this region in the sky, 1.33 degrees across, yielded only one likely source: TXS&amp;nbsp;0506+056, a previously-known blazar, which was found to be in a flaring state of high [[gamma ray]] emission.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt;&lt;ref name=padovani2018/&gt; It was subsequently observed at other wavelengths of light across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], including radio, infrared, optical, X-rays and gamma-rays.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finkbeiner|first=Ann|date=2018-04-17|title=Messengers from the Sky|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-new-era-of-multimessenger-astronomy/|journal=Scientific American|language=en|volume=318|issue=5|pages=36–41|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0518-36|pmid=29672499|issn=0036-8733|archive-url=https://www.amon.psu.edu/files/2018/04/ScientificAmerican-0518-36-1gikqgt.pdf|archive-date=2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of both neutrinos and light from the same object was an early example of [[multi-messenger astronomy]].&lt;ref name="Castelvecchi2018"/&gt;

A search of archived neutrino data from IceCube found evidence for an earlier flare of lower-energy neutrinos in 2014-2015 (a form of [[precovery]]), which supports identification of the blazar as a source of neutrinos.&lt;ref name=IceCube2018b/&gt; An independent analysis found no gamma-ray flare during this earlier period of neutrino emission, but supported its association with the blazar.&lt;ref name=padovani2018/&gt; The neutrinos emitted by TXS&amp;nbsp;0506+056 are six [[orders of magnitude]] higher in energy than those from any previously-identified [[Neutrino astronomy|astrophysical neutrino]] source.&lt;ref name=padovani2018/&gt;

The observations of high energy neutrinos and gamma-rays from this source imply that it is also a source of [[cosmic rays]], because all three should be produced by the same physical processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to particle and astroparticle physics (multimessenger astronomy and its particle physics foundations)|first1=Alessandro |last1=De Angelis |first2=Mario |last2=Pimenta |year=2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-78181-5|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-78181-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; though no cosmic rays from TXS&amp;nbsp;0506+056 have been directly observed.&lt;ref name="Castelvecchi2018"/&gt; In the blazar, a charged [[pion]] was produced by the interaction of a high-energy proton or nucleus (i.e. a cosmic ray) with the radiation field or with matter.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt; The pion then decayed into a [[lepton]] and the neutrino. The neutrino interacts only weakly with matter, so it escaped the blazar.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt; Upon reaching Earth, the neutrino interacted with the Antarctic ice to produce a [[muon]], which was observed by the [[Cherenkov radiation]] it generated as it moved through the IceCube detector.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt;

'''Twilight''' on [[Earth]] is the [[diffuse sky radiation|illumination]] of the lower [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] when the Sun itself is not directly visible because it is below the [[horizon]]. Twilight is produced by [[sunlight]] [[light scattering|scattering]] in the upper atmosphere, illuminating the lower atmosphere so that [[Earth's surface]] is neither completely lit nor completely dark.  The word ''twilight'' is also used to denote the periods of time when this illumination occurs.&lt;ref name=USNO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/RST_defs.php |title=Definitions from the US Astronomical Applications Dept |publisher=[[USNO]] |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The farther the Sun is below the horizon, the dimmer the twilight (other things such as atmospheric conditions being equal). When the Sun reaches 18° below the horizon, the twilight's brightness is nearly zero, and evening twilight becomes [[night]]time. When the Sun again reaches 18° below the horizon, nighttime becomes morning twilight. Owing to its distinctive quality, primarily the absence of shadows and the appearance of objects [[silhouette]]d against the lit sky, twilight has long been popular with photographers, who sometimes refer to it as "sweet light", and painters, who often refer to it as the [[blue hour]], after the [[French language|French]] expression ''l'heure bleue''.

Twilight should not be confused with [[aurora]]s, which can have a similar appearance in the [[night sky]] at high latitudes.
By analogy with evening twilight, the word ''twilight'' is also sometimes used [[metaphor]]ically, to imply that something is losing strength and approaching its end. For example, very old people may be said to be "in the twilight of their lives". The [[collateral adjective]] for ''twilight'' is ''[[crepuscular]]'', which may be used to describe the behavior of [[insect]]s, [[fish]], and [[mammal]]s that are most active during this period.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Definitions by geometry==
Twilight is defined according to the [[solar elevation angle]] ''θ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is the position of the geometric center of the [[sun]] relative to the horizon. There are three established and widely accepted ''subcategories'' of twilight: civil twilight (nearest the horizon), nautical twilight, and astronomical twilight (farthest from the horizon).&lt;ref name=USNO /&gt;

==Definitions and illustrations by illumination==
[[File:Powder Blue Desert Twilight.jpg|thumb|left|Civil twilight in a small town in the [[Mojave Desert]]]]
[[File:Twilight in Landers.jpg|thumb|left|Long exposure of nautical twilight in a small town in the Mojave Desert]]
[[File:Desert Dusk.jpg|thumb|left|Long exposure of astronomical twilight ([[dusk]]) in a small town in the Mojave Desert]]

Three ''subcategories'' of twilight are established and widely accepted: civil twilight (brightest), nautical twilight, and astronomical twilight (darkest).&lt;ref name=USNO /&gt;

==Civil twilight==
Morning civil twilight begins when the geometric center of the [[sun]] is 6° below the [[horizon]]&lt;ref name="TAPN2002"&gt;ftp://ftp.flaterco.com/xtide/Bowditch.pdf#238 The American Practical Navigator, 2002; page 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GOMN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt; and ends at [[sunrise]].&lt;ref name="GOMN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPN2002"/&gt; Evening civil twilight begins at [[sunset]]&lt;ref name="GOMN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPN2002"/&gt; and ends  when the geometric center of the sun reaches 6° below the horizon.&lt;ref name="TAPN2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GOMN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt; In the United States' military, the [[Acronym|initialisms]] '''BMCT''' (begin morning civil twilight, ''i.e.'' civil dawn) and '''EECT''' (end evening civil twilight, ''i.e.'' civil dusk) are used to refer to the start of morning civil twilight and the end of evening civil twilight, respectively. Civil dawn is preceded by morning nautical twilight and civil dusk is followed by evening nautical twilight.

Under clear weather conditions, civil twilight approximates the limit at which solar illumination suffices for the human eye to clearly distinguish terrestrial objects. Enough illumination renders artificial sources unnecessary for most outdoor activities.  At civil dawn and at civil dusk sunlight clearly defines the horizon while the brightest stars and planets can appear.  As observed from the Earth (see [[apparent magnitude]]), sky-gazers know [[Venus]], the brightest planet, as the "morning star" or "evening star” because they can see it during civil twilight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/civil-twilight.html|title=What Is Civil Twilight?|website=www.timeanddate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawmakers have enshrined the concept of civil twilight.  Such statutes typically use a fixed period after sunset or before sunrise (most commonly 20–30 minutes), rather than how many degrees the sun is below the horizon. Examples include the following periods: when drivers of automobiles must turn on their headlights (called [[lighting-up time]] in the UK); when hunting is restricted; when the crime of [[burglary]] is to be treated as nighttime burglary, which carries stiffer penalties in some jurisdictions.

The period may affect when extra equipments, such as anti-collision lights, are required for aircraft to operate&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|14|121.323}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the US, civil twilight for aviation is defined in Part 1.1 of the [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] (FARs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= ELECTRONIC CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS |title= Title 14: Aeronautics and Space PART 1 – Definitions |publisher= U.S. Government Publishing Office |url= http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5322094d58036e143135918076f83a7d&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se14.1.1_11&amp;rgn=div8}}
&lt;/ref&gt; as the time listed in the American Air Almanac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/aira.php|title=The Air Almanac|website=aa.usno.navy.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nautical twilight==

===Definition===
Morning nautical twilight begins (nautical dawn) when the geometric center of the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the morning and ends when the geometric center of the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon in the morning. Evening nautical twilight begins when the geometric center of the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon in the evening and ends (nautical dusk) when the geometric center of the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/nautical-twilight.html|title=What Is Nautical Twilight?|website=www.timeanddate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nautical dawn and dusk===
Nautical dawn is the moment when the geometric center of the Sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the morning. It is preceded by morning astronomical twilight and followed by morning nautical twilight. Nautical dusk is the moment when the geometric center of the Sun is 12 degrees below the horizon in the evening. It marks the beginning of evening astronomical twilight and the end of evening nautical twilight.&lt;ref name="TAPN2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GOMN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/nautical-twilight.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PanoSantPere.jpg|thumb|right|250px|At the beginning of nautical twilight, artificial lighting must be used to see terrestrial objects clearly.]]
[[File:Twilight Toronto across Lake Ontario51km with ship5-10km.jpg|right|thumb|Evening nautical twilight on [[Lake Ontario]], Canada]]
Before nautical dawn and after nautical dusk, sailors cannot navigate via the horizon at sea as they cannot clearly see the horizon.&lt;ref name="Low precision formulae"/&gt;{{notinsourcegiven|date=April 2018}} At nautical dawn and nautical dusk, the human eye finds it difficult, if not impossible, to discern traces of illumination near the sunset or sunrise point of the horizon ("first light” after nautical dawn but before civil dawn and "nightfall" after civil dusk but before nautical dusk).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Sailors can take reliable star sightings of well-known stars, during the stage of nautical twilight when they can distinguish a visible horizon for reference (i.e. after astronomic dawn or before astronomic dusk).  
Under good atmospheric conditions with the absence of other illumination, during nautical twilight, the human eye may distinguish general outlines of ground objects but cannot participate in detailed outdoor operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/RST_defs.php Rise, Set, and Twilight Definitions&lt;/ref&gt;

Nautical twilight has military considerations as well. The initialisms '''BMNT''' (begin morning nautical twilight, ''i.e.'' nautical dawn) and '''EENT''' (end evening nautical twilight, ''i.e.'' nautical dusk) are used and considered when planning military operations. A military unit may treat BMNT and EENT with heightened security, e.g. by "standing to", in which everyone assumes a defensive position. This is partially due to tactics dating back to the [[French and Indian War]] (part of the [[Seven Years' War]] of 1756–1763), when combatants on both sides would launch attacks at nautical dawn or dusk.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Astronomical twilight==
===Astronomical dawn and dusk===
Astronomical dawn is the moment when the geometric center of the Sun is 18 degrees below the horizon in the morning. Astronomical dusk is the moment when the geometric center of the Sun is 18 degrees below the horizon in the evening. After astronomical dusk and before astronomical dawn, the sky is not illuminated by the sun.&lt;ref name="TAPN2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GOMN"&gt;http://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/NAV_PUBS/APN/Gloss-1.pdf#9 Glossary of Marine Navigation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/public/ask/2445 University of Cambridge – Institute of Astronomy – Ask an Astronomer ['''NB: questionable source as its sources refer back to Wikipedia''']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USNO"/&gt;

====Definition====
Morning astronomical twilight begins (astronomical dawn) when the geometric center of the sun is 18° below the horizon in the morning and ends when the geometric center of the sun is 12° below the horizon in the morning. Evening astronomical twilight begins when the geometric center of the sun is 12° below the horizon in the evening and ends (astronomical dusk) when the geometric center of the sun is 18° below the horizon in the evening.&lt;ref name="GOMN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"/&gt;
In some places (away from urban [[light pollution]], [[moonlight]], [[aurora]]s, and other sources of light), where the sky is dark enough for nearly all astronomical observations, astronomers can easily make observations of point sources such as stars both during and after astronomical twilight in the evening and both before and during astronomical twilight in the morning. However, some critical observations, such as of faint diffuse items such as [[nebula]]e and [[galaxy|galaxies]], may require observation beyond the limit of astronomical twilight.  Theoretically, the faintest stars detectable by the naked eye (those of approximately the sixth magnitude) will become visible in the evening at [[dusk|astronomical dusk]], and become invisible at [[dawn|astronomical dawn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/astronomical-twilight.html|title=What Is Astronomical Twilight?|website=www.timeanddate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Astronomical Dusk.jpg|thumb|right|Evening astronomical twilight ([[dusk]])]]

However, in other places, especially those with [[skyglow]], astronomical twilight may be almost indistinguishable from night. In the evening, even when astronomical twilight has yet to end and in the morning when astronomical twilight has already begun, most casual observers would consider the entire sky fully dark.  Because of [[light pollution]], observers in some localities, generally in large cities, may never have the opportunity to view even fourth-magnitude stars, irrespective of the presence of any twilight at all, and to experience truly dark skies.

==Times of occurrence==
[[File:Twilight latitudes world map.svg|thumb|World map showing limiting latitudes of each type of twilight during the solstices]]

===Between day and night===
Observers within 48.5 degrees of the Equator can view twilight twice each day on every date of the year between astronomical [[dawn]], nautical dawn, or civil dawn, and [[sunrise]] as well as between [[sunset]] and civil dusk, nautical dusk, or astronomical [[dusk]]. This also occurs for most observers at higher latitudes on many dates throughout the year, except those around the summer solstice. However, at latitudes closer than 9 degrees to either Pole, the Sun cannot rise above the horizon nor sink more than 18 degrees below it on the same day on any date, this example of twilight cannot occur because the angular difference between solar noon and solar midnight elevates less than 18 degrees.

===Lasting from one day to the next===
At latitudes greater than about 48.5 degrees North or South, on dates near the summer solstice, twilight can last from sunset to sunrise, since the Sun does not go more than 18 degrees below the horizon, so complete darkness does not occur even at solar midnight. These latitudes include many densely populated regions of the Earth, including the entire [[United Kingdom]] and other countries in [[northern Europe]].

===Between one night and the next===
In [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] latitudes in wintertime, the [[polar night]] only rarely produces complete darkness for 24 hours each day. This can occur only at locations within 5.5 degrees of latitude of the Pole, and there only on dates close to the [[winter solstice]]. At all other latitudes and dates, the polar night includes a daily period of twilight, when the Sun is not far below the horizon. Around winter solstice, when the solar declination changes slowly, complete darkness lasts several weeks at the Pole itself, e.g., from May 11 to July 31 at [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]].{{efn|This is the range of dates when the Sun is more than 18 degrees north of the [[Celestial equator]], so it is more than 18 degrees below the horizon as seen from the South Pole. See [[Position of the Sun#Declination of the Sun as seen from Earth]].}} North Pole has the experience of this from November 12 to January 30.

===Lasting for 24 hours===
At latitudes within 9 degrees of either Pole, as the sun's angular elevation difference is less than 18 degrees, twilight can last for the entire 24 hours. This occurs for one day at latitudes near 9 degrees from the Pole and extends up to several weeks the further towards the Pole one goes. The only permanent settlement to experience this condition is [[Alert, Nunavut]], Canada, where it occurs for a week in late February, and again in late October.

The apparent travel of the sun occurs at the rate of 15 degrees per hour (360° per day), but sunrise and sunset happen typically at oblique angles to the horizon and the actual duration of any twilight period will be a function of that angle, being longer for more oblique angles. This angle of the sun's motion with respect to the horizon changes with [[latitude]] as well as the time of year (affecting the angle of the Earth's axis with respect to the sun).

At [[Greenwich, England]] (51.5°N), the duration of civil twilight will vary from 33 minutes to 48 minutes, depending on the time of year. At the [[equator]], conditions can go from day to night in as little as 20–25 minutes. This is true because at [[low latitudes]] the sun's apparent movement is [[perpendicular]] to the observer's horizon. But at the poles, civil twilight can be as long as 2–3 weeks. In the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions, twilight (if there is any) can last for several hours. There is no astronomical twilight at the poles near the [[winter solstice]] (for about 74 days at the North Pole and about 80 days at the South Pole). As one gets closer to the Arctic and Antarctic circles, the sun's disk moves toward the observer's horizon at a lower angle. The observer's earthly location will pass through the various twilight zones less directly, taking more time.

Within the [[polar circle]]s, [[midnight sun|twenty-four-hour daylight]] is encountered in summer, and in regions very close to the poles, twilight can last for weeks on the winter side of the [[equinox]]es. Outside the polar circles, where the angular distance from the polar circle is less than the angle which defines twilight (see above), twilight can continue through local midnight near the [[summer solstice]]. The precise position of the polar circles, and the regions where twilight can continue through local midnight, varies slightly from year to year with Earth's [[axial tilt]]. The lowest latitudes at which the various twilights can continue through local midnight are approximately 60.561° (60°33′43″) for civil twilight, 54.561° (54°33′43″) for nautical twilight and 48.561° (48°33′43″) for astronomical twilight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gandraxa.com/length_of_day.xml |title=Length of Day and Twilight (Formulas) |publisher=www.gandraxa.com |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Glarner's website, reference 2. "Civil Twilight" "6°", "Nautical Twilight" "12°". "90°-Axis(23.439°)-12°=54.561°.&lt;/ref&gt;

These are the largest cities of their respective countries where the various twilights can continue through local solar midnight:

* Civil twilight from sunset to sunrise: [[Tampere]], [[Umeå]], [[Trondheim]], [[Tórshavn]], [[Reykjavík]], [[Nuuk]], [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]], [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Fairbanks]], [[Ålesund]], [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], and [[Baltasound]].
* Nautical twilight from civil dusk to civil dawn: [[Moscow]], [[Vitebsk]], [[Vilnius]], [[Riga]], [[Tallinn]], [[Wejherowo]], [[Flensburg]], [[Helsinki]], [[Stockholm]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Oslo]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Glasgow]], [[Belfast]], [[Letterkenny]], [[Petropavl]], [[Grande Prairie]], [[Juneau]], [[Ushuaia]], and [[Puerto Williams]].
* Astronomical twilight from nautical dusk to nautical dawn: [[Hulun Buir]], [[Erdenet]], [[Astana]], [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], [[Kiev]], [[Minsk]], [[Warsaw]], [[Košice]], [[Paris]], [[Dublin]], [[Zwettl]], [[Prague]], [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] (Falkland Islands), [[Berlin]], [[Luxembourg City]], [[Brussels]], [[Amsterdam]], [[London]], [[Cardiff]], [[Calgary]], [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]], [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]] (largest in the continental USA), [[Rio Gallegos]], and [[Punta Arenas]].
* Major cities that near astronomical twilight from nautical dusk to nautical dawn: [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]] (48°25′0"N), [[Brest, France|Brest]] (48°23′26"N), [[Thunder Bay]] (48°22′56″N),  [[Vienna]] (48°12′30″N), [[Bratislava]] (48°8′38″N), [[Munich]] (48°8'0″N)

Although Helsinki, Oslo, Stockholm, Tallinn, and Saint Petersburg also enter into nautical twilight after sunset, they do have noticeably lighter skies at night during the summer solstice than other locations mentioned in their category above, because they do not go far into nautical twilight. A [[White night (astronomy)|white night]] is a night with only civil twilight which lasts from sunset to sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/white_night|title=white night - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the winter solstice within the polar circle, twilight can extend through solar noon at latitudes below 72.561° (72°33′43″) for civil twilight, 78.561° (78°33′43″) for nautical twilight, and 84.561° (84°33′43″) for astronomical twilight.

==On other planets==
Twilight on [[Mars]] is longer than on Earth, lasting for up to two hours before sunrise or after sunset. Dust high in the atmosphere scatters light to the night side of the planet. Similar twilights are seen on Earth following major [[volcanic eruption]]s.&lt;ref&gt;NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory: [http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/spotlight/20060807.html Winter Solstice on Mars: Rovers Look Forward to A Second Martian Spring], August 07, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion ==
=== Christianity ===
[[File:BenedictineEasterVigil.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United States|American]] [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monk]]s around an [[Easter fire]] preparing to light the [[Paschal candle]] prior to Easter Vigil [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]]]
In [[Christian]] practice, "[[vigil]]" observances often occur during twilight on the evening before major feast days or holidays. For example, the ''[[Easter Vigil]]'' is held in the hours of darkness between sunset on [[Holy Saturday]] and sunrise on [[Easter Day]] — most commonly in the evening of Holy Saturday or midnight — and is the first celebration of Easter, days traditionally being considered to begin at sunset.

=== Hinduism ===
Twilight is sacred in [[Hinduism]]. It is called गोधूळिवेळ ''gōdhūḷivēḷ'' in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] or गोधूलिवेला ''godhūlivelā'' in [[Hindi language|Hindi]], గొధూళివేళ "godhoolivela" in Telugu, literally "cow dust time". Many [[ritual]]s, including [[Sandhyavandanam]] and [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]], are performed at twilight hour. Eating of food is not advised during this time. Sometimes it is referred to as Asurasandhya vela. It is believed that [[Asura]]s are active during these hours. One of the avatars of Lord [[Vishnu]], [[Narasimha]], is closely associated with the twilight period. According to [[Hindu scriptures]], a daemonic king, [[Hiranakashipa]], performed penance and obtained a boon from [[Brahma]] that he could not be killed during day or night and neither by human nor animal. Lord [[Vishnu]] appeared in a half-man half-lion form (neither human nor animal), ended the life of Hiranakashipa during twilight (neither day nor night).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGEXAAAAIAAJ |title=India democracy and education | author=Jossleyn Hennessy |publisher=Orient Longmans |year=1955 |chapter=ch. VII Education in the villages "Cow-dust time" |page=127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
Twilight is important in [[Islam]] as it determines when certain [[salat|universally obligatory prayers]] are to be recited. Morning twilight is when morning prayers (''[[Fajr]]'') are done, while evening twilight is the time for evening prayers (''[[Maghrib prayer]]''). Suhoor (early morning meal) time for fasting (during Ramadan and other times) ends at morning twilight (at dawn). Fasting is from the beginning of dawn to sunset. There is also an important discussion in Islamic jurisprudence between "true dawn" and "[[Zodiacal light#Importance to Islam|false dawn]]".

=== Judaism ===
In Judaism, twilight is considered neither day nor night; consequently it is treated as a safeguard against encroachment upon either. For example, the twilight of Friday is reckoned as [[Sabbath]] eve, and that of Saturday as Sabbath day; and the same rule applies to festival days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14114-sun-rising-and-setting-of-the|title=SUN, RISING AND SETTING OF THE - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kolbenluftpumpe hg.jpg|thumb|Pump to demonstrate vacuum]]

'''Vacuum''' is [[space]] devoid of [[matter]]. The word stems from the Latin adjective ''vacuus'' for "vacant" or "void". An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous [[pressure]] much less than [[atmospheric pressure]].&lt;ref name="chambers"&gt;{{cite book |first=Austin |last=Chambers |date=2004 |title=Modern Vacuum Physics |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |isbn=978-0-8493-2438-3 |oclc=55000526}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a ''perfect'' vacuum, which they sometimes simply call "vacuum" or '''free space''', and use the term '''partial vacuum''' to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a [[laboratory]] or in [[outer space|space]]. In engineering and applied physics on the other hand, vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Nigel S. |date=1989 |title=Modern Vacuum Practice |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=3 |isbn=978-0-07-707099-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin term '''''in vacuo''''' is used to describe an object that is surrounded by a vacuum.

The ''quality'' of a partial vacuum refers to how closely it approaches a perfect vacuum. Other things equal, lower gas [[pressure]] means higher-quality vacuum. For example, a typical [[vacuum cleaner]] produces enough [[suction]] to reduce air pressure by around 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Jeff |date=2005 |isbn=978-1-59486-274-8 |page=97 |title=Speed cleaning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqegeIz9dyQC&amp;pg=PA97}} Note that 1 inch of water is ≈0.0025 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]].&lt;/ref&gt; Much higher-quality vacuums are possible. [[Ultra-high vacuum]] chambers, common in chemistry, physics, and engineering, operate below one trillionth (10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) of atmospheric pressure (100&amp;nbsp;nPa), and can reach around 100 particles/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Gabrielse /&gt; [[Outer space]] is an even higher-quality vacuum, with the equivalent of just a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter on average in intergalactic space.&lt;ref name=tadokoro&gt;{{cite journal
 | last=Tadokoro | first=M. | title=A Study of the Local Group by Use of the Virial Theorem

 | bibcode=1968PASJ...20..230T }} This source estimates a density of {{val|7|e=-29|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} for the [[Local Group]]. An [[atomic mass unit]] is {{val|1.66|e=-24|u=g}}, for roughly 40 atoms per cubic meter.&lt;/ref&gt; According to modern understanding, even if all matter could be removed from a volume, it would still not be "empty" due to [[vacuum fluctuations]], [[dark energy]], transiting [[gamma ray]]s, [[cosmic ray]]s, [[neutrino]]s, and other phenomena in [[quantum physics]]. In the study of [[electromagnetism]] in the 19th century, vacuum was thought to be filled with a medium called [[Luminiferous aether|aether]]. In modern particle physics, the [[vacuum state]] is considered the [[ground state]] of a [[Field (physics)|field]].

Vacuum has been a frequent topic of [[philosophical]] debate since ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] times, but was not studied empirically until the 17th century. [[Evangelista Torricelli]] produced the first laboratory vacuum in 1643, and other experimental techniques were developed as a result of his theories of [[atmospheric pressure]]. A '''torricellian vacuum''' is created by filling a tall glass container closed at one end with mercury, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury (see below).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7igDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT3 ''How to Make an Experimental Geissler Tube''], [[Popular Science]] monthly, February 1919, Unnumbered page. Bonnier Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

Vacuum became a valuable industrial tool in the 20th century with the introduction of [[incandescent light bulb]]s and [[vacuum tube]]s, and a wide array of vacuum technology has since become available. The recent development of [[human spaceflight]] has raised interest in the impact of vacuum on human health, and on life forms in general.

== Etymology ==
The word ''vacuum'' comes {{ety|la||an empty space, void}}, noun use of neuter of ''vacuus'', meaning "empty", related to ''vacare'', meaning "be empty".

''Vacuum'' is one of the few words in the [[English language]] that contains two consecutive letters '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''[[u]]'''.&lt;ref name=double_u&gt;{{cite web | title=What words in the English language contain two u's in a row? | website=Oxford Dictionaries Online | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/what-words-in-the-english-language-contain-two-u-s-in-a-row/ | accessdate=2011-10-23 | postscript={{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical interpretation ==
Historically, there has been much dispute over whether such a thing as a vacuum can exist. Ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] debated the existence of a vacuum, or void, in the context of [[atomism]], which posited void and atom as the fundamental explanatory elements of physics. Following [[Plato]], even the abstract concept of a featureless void faced considerable skepticism: it could not be apprehended by the senses, it could not, itself, provide additional explanatory power beyond the physical volume with which it was commensurate and, by definition, it was quite literally nothing at all, which cannot rightly be said to exist. [[Aristotle]] believed that no void could occur naturally, because the denser surrounding material continuum would immediately fill any incipient rarity that might give rise to a void.

In his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', book IV, Aristotle offered numerous arguments against the void: for example, that motion through a medium which offered no impediment could continue ''ad infinitum'', there being no reason that something would come to rest anywhere in particular. Although [[Lucretius]] argued for the existence of vacuum in the first century BC and [[Hero of Alexandria]] tried unsuccessfully to create an artificial vacuum in the first century AD,&lt;ref name="genz"&gt;{{cite book| last =Genz | first =Henning | publication-date =1999 | date =1994 | title =Nothingness, the Science of Empty Space | edition =translated from German by Karin Heusch | place =New York | publisher =Perseus Book Publishing | isbn =978-0-7382-0610-3 | oclc =48836264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was European [[scholasticism|scholars]] such as [[Roger Bacon]], [[Blasius of Parma]] and [[Walter Burley]] in the 13th and 14th century who focused considerable attention on these issues. Eventually following [[Stoic physics]] in this instance, scholars from the 14th century onward increasingly departed from the Aristotelian perspective in favor of a [[supernatural]] void beyond the confines of the cosmos itself, a conclusion widely acknowledged by the 17th century, which helped to segregate natural and theological concerns.&lt;ref name="Barrow2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.D. |last=Barrow |date=2002 |title=The Book of Nothing: Vacuums, Voids, and the Latest Ideas About the Origins of the Universe |series=Vintage Series |publisher=Vintage |isbn=978-0-375-72609-5 |lccn=00058894 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sU_K0wbBeugC&amp;pg=PA77 |pages=71–72, 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost two thousand years after Plato, [[René Descartes]] also proposed a geometrically based alternative theory of atomism, without the problematic nothing–everything [[dichotomy]] of void and atom. Although Descartes agreed with the contemporary position, that a vacuum does not occur in nature, the success of his [[Cartesian coordinate system|namesake coordinate system]] and more implicitly, the spatial–corporeal component of his metaphysics would come to define the philosophically modern notion of empty space as a quantified extension of volume. By the ancient definition however, directional information and magnitude were conceptually distinct.

In the medieval Middle Eastern world, the physicist and Islamic  scholar, [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius, 872–950),  conducted a small [[experiment]] concerning the existence of vacuum, in which he investigated handheld plungers in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher = AZP (ZMD Corporation) | isbn = 978-0-9702389-0-0 | last = Zahoor | first = Akram | title = Muslim History: 570–1950 C.E | location = Gaithersburg, MD | date = 2000}}{{Self-published inline|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2010}} He concluded that air's volume can expand to fill available space, and he suggested that the concept of perfect vacuum was incoherent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-natural Arabic and Islamic Natural Philosophy and Natural Science], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Nader El-Bizri, the physicist [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen, 965–1039) and the [[Mu'tazili]] [[Kalam|theologians]] disagreed with Aristotle and Al-Farabi, and they supported the existence of a void.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was much discussion of whether the air moved in quickly enough as the plates were separated, or, as [[Walter Burley]] postulated, whether a 'celestial agent' prevented the vacuum arising.

[[Jean Buridan]] reported in the 14th century that teams of ten horses could not pull open [[bellows]] when the port was sealed.&lt;ref name="genz" /&gt;

[[File:Crookes tube two views.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Crookes tube]], used to discover and study [[cathode ray]]s, was an evolution of the [[Geissler tube]].]]

The 17th century saw the first attempts to quantify measurements of partial vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denmark.com.au/en/Worlds+Largest+Barometer/default.htm |title=The World's Largest Barometer |accessdate=2008-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417093648/http://www.denmark.com.au/en/Worlds%2BLargest%2BBarometer/default.htm |archivedate=2008-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evangelista Torricelli]]'s [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] [[barometer]] of 1643 and [[Blaise Pascal]]'s experiments both demonstrated a partial vacuum.

In 1654, [[Otto von Guericke]] invented the first [[vacuum pump]]&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica:Otto von Guericke&lt;/ref&gt; and conducted his famous [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] experiment, showing that teams of horses could not separate two hemispheres from which the air had been partially evacuated. [[Robert Boyle]] improved Guericke's design and with the help of [[Robert Hooke]] further developed vacuum pump technology. Thereafter, research into the partial vacuum lapsed until 1850 when [[August Toepler]] invented the [[Toepler Pump]] and [[Heinrich Geissler]] invented the mercury displacement pump in 1855, achieving a partial vacuum of about 10&amp;nbsp;Pa (0.1&amp;nbsp;[[Torr]]). A number of electrical properties become observable at this vacuum level, which renewed interest in further research.

While outer space provides the most rarefied example of a naturally occurring partial vacuum, the heavens were originally thought to be seamlessly filled by a rigid indestructible material called [[aether (classical element)|aether]]. Borrowing somewhat from the [[pneuma]] of [[Stoic physics]], aether came to be regarded as the rarefied air from which it took its name, (see [[Aether (mythology)]]). Early theories of [[light]] posited a ubiquitous terrestrial and celestial medium through which light propagated. Additionally, the concept informed [[Isaac Newton]]'s explanations of both [[refraction]] and of radiant heat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hogarth Patterson]], ''Essays in History and Art 10'', 1862&lt;/ref&gt;  19th century experiments into this [[luminiferous aether]] attempted to detect a minute drag on the Earth's orbit. While the Earth does, in fact, move through a relatively dense medium in comparison to that of interstellar space, the drag is so minuscule that it could not be detected. In 1912, [[astronomer]] [[William Henry Pickering|Henry Pickering]] commented: "While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, [it] is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous molecules are certainly there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pickering | first1 = W.

Later, in 1930, [[Paul Dirac]] proposed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles possessing negative energy, called the [[Dirac sea]]. This theory helped refine the predictions of his earlier formulated [[Dirac equation]], and successfully predicted the existence of the [[positron]], confirmed two years later. [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[uncertainty principle]] formulated in 1927, predict a fundamental limit within which instantaneous position and [[momentum]], or energy and time can be measured. This has far reaching consequences on the "emptiness" of space between particles. In the late 20th century, so-called [[virtual particle]]s that arise spontaneously from empty space were confirmed.

== Classical field theories ==
{{refimprove|subsection|date=April 2014}}
The strictest criterion to define a vacuum is a region of space and time where all the components of the [[stress–energy tensor]] are zero. This means that this region is devoid of energy and momentum, and by consequence, it must be empty of particles and other physical fields (such as electromagnetism) that contain energy and momentum.

=== Gravity ===
{{refimprove|subsection|date=April 2014}}
In [[general relativity]], a vanishing stress-energy tensor implies, through [[Einstein field equations]], the vanishing of all the components of the [[Ricci tensor]]. Vacuum does not mean that the curvature of [[space-time]] is necessarily flat: the gravitational field can still produce curvature in a vacuum in the form of tidal forces and [[gravitational wave]]s (technically, these phenomena are the components of the [[Weyl tensor]]). The [[black hole]] (with zero electric charge) is an elegant example of a region completely "filled" with vacuum, but still showing a strong curvature.

[[File:Vacuum fluctuations revealed through spontaneous parametric down-conversion.ogv|thumb|350px|A video of an experiment showing [[vacuum fluctuations]] (in the red ring) amplified by [[spontaneous parametric down-conversion]].]]

In [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]], the vacuum is defined as the state (that is, the solution to the equations of the theory) with the lowest possible energy (the [[ground state]] of the [[Hilbert space]]). In [[quantum electrodynamics]] this vacuum is referred to as '[[QED vacuum]]' to distinguish it from the vacuum of [[quantum chromodynamics]], denoted as [[QCD vacuum]]. QED vacuum is a state with no matter particles (hence the name), and also no [[photon]]s. As described above, this state is impossible to achieve experimentally. (Even if every matter particle could somehow be removed from a volume, it would be impossible to eliminate all the [[black body radiation|blackbody photons]].) Nonetheless, it provides a good model for realizable vacuum, and agrees with a number of experimental observations as described next.

QED vacuum has interesting and complex properties. In QED vacuum, the electric and magnetic fields have zero average values, but their variances are not zero.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;For example, see {{cite book |title=Molecular Quantum Electrodynamics |author=Craig, D. P. |author2= Thirunamachandran, T. |last-author-amp=yes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpbdozIZt3sC&amp;pg=PA40 |page=40 |isbn=978-0-486-40214-7 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |date=1998 |edition=Reprint of Academic Press 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, QED vacuum contains [[vacuum fluctuations]] ([[virtual particles]] that hop into and out of existence), and a finite energy called [[vacuum energy]]. Vacuum fluctuations are an essential and ubiquitous part of quantum field theory. Some experimentally verified effects of vacuum fluctuations include [[spontaneous emission]] and the [[Lamb shift]].&lt;ref name=Barrow /&gt;  [[Coulomb's law]] and the [[electric potential]] in vacuum near an electric charge are modified.&lt;ref name=Zeidler&gt;In effect, the dielectric permittivity of the vacuum of classical electromagnetism is changed. For example, see {{cite book |chapter=§&amp;nbsp;19.1.9 Vacuum polarization in quantum electrodynamics |author=Zeidler, Eberhard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miwuxaEXvOsC&amp;pg=PA952 |page=952 |isbn=978-3-642-22420-1 |publisher=Springer |date=2011 |title=Quantum Field Theory III: Gauge Theory: A Bridge Between Mathematicians and Physicists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, in QCD multiple vacuum states can coexist.&lt;ref name=Altarelli&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBCyYTobfJ8C&amp;pg=PT19 |pages=2–3 |author=Altarelli, Guido  |title=Elementary Particles: Volume 21/A of Landolt-Börnstein series |chapter=Chapter 2: Gauge theories and the Standard Model |quote=The fundamental state of minimum energy, the vacuum, is not unique and there are a continuum of degenerate states that altogether respect the symmetry... |isbn=978-3-540-74202-9 |publisher=Springer |date=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The starting and ending of [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmological inflation]] is thought to have arisen from transitions between different vacuum states. For theories obtained by quantization of a classical theory, each [[stationary point]] of the energy in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] gives rise to a single vacuum. [[String theory]] is believed to have a huge number of vacua – the so-called [[string theory landscape]].

== Outer space ==
{{Main|Outer space}}

[[File:Structure of the magnetosphere-en.svg|left|thumb|350px|Outer space is not a perfect vacuum, but a tenuous [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] awash with charged particles, free elements such as [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] and [[oxygen]], [[electromagnetic field]]s, and the occasional [[star]].]]

[[Outer space]] has very low density and pressure, and is the closest physical approximation of a perfect vacuum. But no vacuum is truly perfect, not even in interstellar space, where there are still a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter.&lt;ref name=tadokoro /&gt;

Stars, planets, and moons keep their [[atmosphere]]s by gravitational attraction, and as such, atmospheres have no clearly delineated boundary: the density of atmospheric gas simply decreases with distance from the object. The Earth's atmospheric pressure drops to about {{val|3.2|e=-2|u=[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]}} at {{convert|100|km|mi}} of altitude,&lt;ref name=squire2000&gt;{{cite journal | first=Tom | last=Squire | date=September 27, 2000 | title=U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1976 | journal=Thermal Protection Systems Expert and Material Properties Database | url=http://tpsx.arc.nasa.gov/cgi-perl/alt.pl | accessdate=2011-10-23 | postscript={{inconsistent citations}} | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015062917/http://tpsx.arc.nasa.gov/cgi-perl/alt.pl | archivedate=October 15, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kármán line]], which is a common definition of the boundary with outer space. Beyond this line, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to [[radiation pressure]] from the [[Sun]] and the [[dynamic pressure]] of the [[solar wind]]s, so the definition of pressure becomes difficult to interpret. The [[thermosphere]] in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to [[space weather]]. Astrophysicists prefer to use [[number density]] to describe these environments, in units of particles per cubic centimetre.

But although it meets the definition of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on [[satellite]]s. Most artificial satellites operate in this region called [[low Earth orbit]] and must fire their engines every few days to maintain orbit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The drag here is low enough that it could theoretically be overcome by radiation pressure on [[solar sail]]s, a proposed propulsion system for [[interplanetary travel]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Planets are too massive for their trajectories to be significantly affected by these forces, although their atmospheres are eroded by the solar winds.

All of the [[observable universe]] is filled with large numbers of [[photon]]s, the so-called [[cosmic background radiation]], and quite likely a correspondingly large number of [[neutrino]]s. The current [[temperature]] of this radiation is about 3 [[Kelvin|K]], or −270 degrees Celsius or −454 degrees Fahrenheit.

== Measurement ==
{{Main|Pressure measurement}}

The quality of a vacuum is indicated by the amount of matter remaining in the system, so that a high quality vacuum is one with very little matter left in it. Vacuum is primarily measured by its [[absolute pressure]], but a complete characterization requires further parameters, such as [[temperature]] and chemical composition. One of the most important parameters is the [[mean free path]] (MFP) of residual gases, which indicates the average distance that molecules will travel between collisions with each other. As the gas density decreases, the MFP increases, and when the MFP is longer than the chamber, pump, spacecraft, or other objects present, the continuum assumptions of [[fluid mechanics]] do not apply. This vacuum state is called ''high vacuum'', and the study of fluid flows in this regime is called particle gas dynamics. The MFP of air at atmospheric pressure is very short, 70&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]], but at 100&amp;nbsp;[[millipascal|mPa]] (~{{val|1|e=-3|u=[[Torr]]}}) the MFP of room temperature air is roughly 100&amp;nbsp;mm, which is on the order of everyday objects such as [[vacuum tube]]s. The [[Crookes radiometer]] turns when the MFP is larger than the size of the vanes.

Vacuum quality is subdivided into ranges according to the technology required to achieve it or measure it. These ranges do not have universally agreed definitions, but a typical distribution is shown in the following table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American Vacuum Society |title=Glossary |website=AVS Reference Guide |url=http://www.aip.org/avsguide/refguide/glossary.html#v |accessdate=2006-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304160701/http://www.aip.org/avsguide/refguide/glossary.html |archivedate=2006-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=National Physical Laboratory, UK| title=What do 'high vacuum' and 'low vacuum' mean?

* '''Atmospheric pressure''' is variable but standardized at 101.325&amp;nbsp;kPa (760&amp;nbsp;Torr).
* '''Low vacuum''', also called ''rough vacuum'' or ''coarse vacuum'', is vacuum that can be achieved or measured with rudimentary equipment such as a [[vacuum cleaner]] and a liquid column [[Pressure measurement|manometer]].
* '''Medium vacuum''' is vacuum that can be achieved with a single pump, but the pressure is too low to measure with a liquid or mechanical manometer. It can be measured with a [[McLeod gauge]], thermal gauge or a capacitive gauge.
* '''High vacuum''' is vacuum where the [[mean free path|MFP]] of residual gases is longer than the size of the chamber or of the object under test. High vacuum usually requires multi-stage pumping and ion gauge measurement. Some texts differentiate between high vacuum and ''very high vacuum.''
* '''Ultra high vacuum''' requires baking the chamber to remove trace gases, and other special procedures. British and German standards define ultra high vacuum as pressures below 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pa (10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Torr).&lt;ref&gt;BS 2951: Glossary of Terms Used in Vacuum Technology. Part I. Terms of General Application. British Standards Institution, London, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DIN 28400: Vakuumtechnik Bennenungen und Definitionen, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Deep space''' is generally much more empty than any artificial vacuum. It may or may not meet the definition of high vacuum above, depending on what region of space and astronomical bodies are being considered. For example, the MFP of interplanetary space is smaller than the size of the Solar System, but larger than small planets and moons. As a result, solar winds exhibit continuum flow on the scale of the Solar System, but must be considered a bombardment of particles with respect to the Earth and Moon.
* '''Perfect vacuum''' is an ideal state of no particles at all. It cannot be achieved in a [[laboratory]], although there may be small volumes which, for a brief moment, happen to have no particles of matter in them. Even if all particles of matter were removed, there would still be [[photon]]s and [[graviton]]s, as well as [[dark energy]], [[virtual particle]]s, and other aspects of the [[quantum vacuum]].
* '''Hard vacuum''' and '''soft vacuum''' are terms that are defined with a dividing line defined differently by different sources, such as 1 [[Torr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Relative versus absolute measurement ===
Vacuum is measured in units of [[pressure]], typically as a subtraction relative to ambient atmospheric pressure on Earth. But the amount of relative measurable vacuum varies with local conditions. On the surface of [[Jupiter]], where ground level atmospheric pressure is much higher than on Earth, much higher relative vacuum readings would be possible. On the surface of the moon with almost no atmosphere, it would be extremely difficult to create a measurable vacuum relative to the local environment.

Similarly, much higher than normal relative vacuum readings are possible deep in the Earth's ocean. A [[submarine]] maintaining an internal pressure of 1 atmosphere submerged to a depth of 10 atmospheres (98 metres; a 9.8 metre column of seawater has the equivalent weight of 1 atm) is effectively a vacuum chamber keeping out the crushing exterior water pressures, though the 1 atm inside the submarine would not normally be considered a vacuum.

Therefore, to properly understand the following discussions of vacuum measurement, it is important that the reader assumes the relative measurements are being done on Earth at sea level, at exactly 1 atmosphere of ambient atmospheric pressure.

=== Measurements relative to 1 atm ===
[[File:McLeod gauge 01.jpg|right|thumb|A glass McLeod gauge, drained of mercury]]
The [[SI]] unit of pressure is the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (symbol Pa), but vacuum is often measured in [[torr]]s, named for Torricelli, an early Italian physicist (1608–1647). A torr is equal to the displacement of a millimeter of mercury ([[mmHg]]) in a [[manometer]] with 1&amp;nbsp;torr equaling 133.3223684 pascals above absolute zero pressure. Vacuum is often also measured on the [[barometer|barometric]] scale or as a percentage of [[atmospheric pressure]] in [[bar (unit)|bars]] or [[atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]].  Low vacuum is often measured in [[millimeters of mercury]] (mmHg) or pascals (Pa) below standard atmospheric pressure. "Below atmospheric" means that the absolute pressure is equal to the current atmospheric pressure.

In other words, most low vacuum gauges that read, for example 50.79&amp;nbsp;Torr. Many inexpensive low vacuum gauges have a margin of error and may report a vacuum of 0&amp;nbsp;Torr but in practice this generally requires a two-stage rotary vane or other medium type of vacuum pump to go much beyond (lower than) 1&amp;nbsp;torr.

=== Measuring instruments ===
Many devices are used to measure the pressure in a vacuum, depending on what range of vacuum is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Moore | last=John H. | author2=Christopher Davis | author3=Michael A. Coplan | author4=Sandra Greer | last-author-amp=yes | title=Building Scientific Apparatus | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, CO | date=2002 | isbn=978-0-8133-4007-4 | oclc=50287675 }}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydrostatic''' gauges (such as the mercury column [[manometer]]) consist of a vertical column of liquid in a tube whose ends are exposed to different pressures. The column will rise or fall until its weight is in equilibrium with the pressure differential between the two ends of the tube. The simplest design is a closed-end U-shaped tube, one side of which is connected to the region of interest. Any fluid can be used, but [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is preferred for its high density and low vapour pressure. Simple hydrostatic gauges can measure pressures ranging from 1&amp;nbsp;torr (100&amp;nbsp;Pa) to above atmospheric. An important variation is the [[McLeod gauge]] which isolates a known volume of vacuum and compresses it to multiply the height variation of the liquid column. The McLeod gauge can measure vacuums as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;torr (0.1&amp;nbsp;mPa), which is the lowest direct measurement of pressure that is possible with current technology. Other vacuum gauges can measure lower pressures, but only indirectly by measurement of other pressure-controlled properties. These indirect measurements must be calibrated via a direct measurement, most commonly a McLeod gauge.&lt;ref name=measure&gt;{{cite book| first=Thomas G. | last=Beckwith | author2=Roy D. Marangoni | author3=John H. Lienhard V | last-author-amp=yes | date=1993 | title=Mechanical Measurements | edition=Fifth | publisher=Addison-Wesley | location=Reading, MA | isbn=978-0-201-56947-6 | pages=591–595 | chapter=Measurement of Low Pressures }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kenotometer is a particular type of hydrostatic gauge, typically used in power plants using steam turbines. The kenotometer measures the vacuum in the steam space of the condenser, that is, the exhaust of the last stage of the turbine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ephf.ca/blog.asp?id=74 | title=Kenotometer Vacuum Gauge | publisher=Edmonton Power Historical Foundation | date=22 November 2013 | accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mechanical''' or '''elastic''' gauges depend on a Bourdon tube, diaphragm, or capsule, usually made of metal, which will change shape in response to the pressure of the region in question. A variation on this idea is the '''capacitance manometer''', in which the diaphragm makes up a part of a capacitor. A change in pressure leads to the flexure of the diaphragm, which results in a change in capacitance. These gauges are effective from 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;torr to 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;torr, and beyond.

'''Thermal conductivity''' gauges rely on the fact that the ability of a gas to conduct heat decreases with pressure. In this type of gauge, a wire filament is heated by running current through it. A [[Thermocouple#Thermocouple as vacuum gauge | thermocouple]] or [[Resistance Temperature Detector]] (RTD) can then be used to measure the temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on the rate at which the filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity. A common variant is the [[Pirani gauge]] which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and RTD. These gauges are accurate from 10&amp;nbsp;torr to 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;torr, but they are sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.

'''[[Ionization gauge]]s''' are used in ultrahigh vacuum. They come in two types: hot cathode and cold cathode. In the [[Hot filament ionization gauge|hot cathode]] version an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;torr to 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; torr. The principle behind [[cold cathode]] version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;torr to 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a mass spectrometer must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Robert M.

== Uses ==
[[File:Gluehlampe 01 KMJ.jpg|thumb|right|[[incandescent light bulb|Light bulbs]] contain a partial vacuum, usually backfilled with [[argon]], which protects the [[tungsten]] filament]]

Vacuum is useful in a variety of processes and devices. Its first widespread use was in the [[incandescent light bulb]] to protect the filament from chemical degradation. The chemical inertness produced by a vacuum is also useful for [[electron beam welding]], [[cold welding]], [[vacuum packing]] and [[Vacuum fryer|vacuum frying]]. [[Ultra-high vacuum]] is used in the study of atomically clean substrates, as only a very good vacuum preserves atomic-scale clean surfaces for a reasonably long time (on the order of minutes to days). High to ultra-high vacuum removes the obstruction of air, allowing particle beams to deposit or remove materials without contamination. This is the principle behind [[chemical vapor deposition]], [[physical vapor deposition]], and [[dry etching]] which are essential to the fabrication of [[semiconductor fabrication|semiconductors]] and [[optical coating]]s, and to [[surface science]]. The reduction of convection provides the thermal insulation of [[thermos bottle]]s. Deep vacuum lowers the [[boiling point]] of liquids and promotes low temperature [[outgassing]] which is used in [[freeze drying]], [[adhesive]] preparation, [[vacuum distillation|distillation]], [[metallurgy]], and process purging. The electrical properties of vacuum make [[electron microscope]]s and [[vacuum tube]]s possible, including [[cathode ray tube]]s. [[Vacuum interrupter]]s are used in electrical switchgear.  [[Vacuum arc]] processes are industrially important for production of certain grades of steel or high purity materials. The elimination of air [[friction]] is useful for [[flywheel energy storage]] and [[ultracentrifuge]]s.

[[File:L-Pumpe2.png|thumb|left|This shallow water well pump reduces atmospheric air pressure inside the pump chamber. Atmospheric pressure extends down into the well, and forces water up the pipe into the pump to balance the reduced pressure. Above-ground pump chambers are only effective to a depth of approximately 9 meters due to the water column weight balancing the atmospheric pressure.]]

=== Vacuum-driven machines ===
Vacuums are commonly used to produce [[suction]], which has an even wider variety of applications. The [[Newcomen steam engine]] used vacuum instead of pressure to drive a piston. In the 19th century, vacuum was used for traction on [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s experimental [[atmospheric railway]].  [[Vacuum brake]]s were once widely used on [[train]]s in the UK but, except on [[heritage railway]]s, they have been replaced by [[Railway air brake|air brakes]].

[[Manifold vacuum]] can be used to drive [[Automobile ancillary power#Vacuum|accessories]] on [[automobile]]s.  The best-known application is the [[vacuum servo]], used to provide power assistance for the [[brake]]s.  Obsolete applications include vacuum-driven [[windscreen wipers]] and [[Autovac]] fuel pumps.  Some aircraft instruments (Attitude Indicator (AI) and the Heading Indicator (HI)) are typically vacuum-powered, as protection against loss of all (electrically powered) instruments, since early aircraft often did not have electrical systems, and since there are two readily available sources of vacuum on a moving aircraft, the engine and an external venturi.
[[Vacuum induction melting]] uses electromagnetic induction within a vacuum.

Maintaining a vacuum in the [[Condenser (steam turbine)|Condenser]] is an important aspect of the efficient operation of [[steam turbine]]s. A steam jet [[Steam ejector|ejector]] or [[Liquid ring pump|liquid ring vacuum pump]] is used for this purpose.  The typical vacuum maintained in the Condenser steam space at the exhaust of the turbine (also called Condenser Backpressure) is in the range 5 to 15 kPa (absolute), depending on the type of condenser and the ambient conditions.

=== Outgassing ===
{{Main|Outgassing}}

[[Evaporation]] and [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] into a vacuum is called [[outgassing]]. All materials, solid or liquid, have a small [[vapour pressure]], and their outgassing becomes important when the vacuum pressure falls below this vapour pressure.  Outgassing has the same effect as a leak and can limit the achievable vacuum. Outgassing products may condense on nearby colder surfaces, which can be troublesome if they obscure optical instruments or react with other materials. This is of great concern to space missions, where an obscured telescope or solar cell can ruin an expensive mission.

The most prevalent outgassing product in vacuum systems is water absorbed by chamber materials. It can be reduced by desiccating or baking the chamber, and removing absorbent materials. Outgassed water can condense in the oil of [[rotary vane pump]]s and reduce their net speed drastically if gas ballasting is not used. High vacuum systems must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing.

Ultra-high vacuum systems are usually baked, preferably under vacuum, to temporarily raise the vapour pressure of all outgassing materials and boil them off. Once the bulk of the outgassing materials are boiled off and evacuated, the system may be cooled to lower vapour pressures and minimize residual outgassing during actual operation. Some systems are cooled well below room temperature by [[liquid nitrogen]] to shut down residual outgassing and simultaneously [[cryopump]] the system.

=== Pumping and ambient air pressure ===
[[File:Hand pump.png|thumb|left|Deep wells have the pump chamber down in the well close to the water surface, or in the water. A "sucker rod" extends from the handle down the center of the pipe deep into the well to operate the plunger. The pump handle acts as a heavy counterweight against both the sucker rod weight and the weight of the water column standing on the upper plunger up to ground level.]]

{{Main|Vacuum pump}}

Fluids cannot generally be pulled, so a vacuum cannot be created by [[suction]]. Suction can spread and dilute a vacuum by letting a higher pressure push fluids into it, but the vacuum has to be created first before suction can occur. The easiest way to create an artificial vacuum is to expand the volume of a container. For example, the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm muscle]] expands the chest cavity, which causes the volume of the lungs to increase. This expansion reduces the pressure and creates a partial vacuum, which is soon filled by air pushed in by atmospheric pressure.

To continue evacuating a chamber indefinitely without requiring infinite growth, a compartment of the vacuum can be repeatedly closed off, exhausted, and expanded again. This is the principle behind [[vacuum pump#Positive displacement pump|positive displacement pumps]], like the manual water pump for example. Inside the pump, a mechanism expands a small sealed cavity to create a vacuum. Because of the pressure differential, some fluid from the chamber (or the well, in our example) is pushed into the pump's small cavity. The pump's cavity is then sealed from the chamber, opened to the atmosphere, and squeezed back to a minute size.

[[File:Cut through turbomolecular pump.jpg|thumb|A cutaway view of a [[turbomolecular pump]], a momentum transfer pump used to achieve high vacuum]]

The above explanation is merely a simple introduction to vacuum pumping, and is not representative of the entire range of pumps in use. Many variations of the positive displacement pump have been developed, and many other pump designs rely on fundamentally different principles. [[vacuum pump#Momentum transfer pump|Momentum transfer pumps]], which bear some similarities to dynamic pumps used at higher pressures, can achieve much higher quality vacuums than positive displacement pumps. [[vacuum pump#Entrapment pump|Entrapment pumps]] can capture gases in a solid or absorbed state, often with no moving parts, no seals and no vibration. None of these pumps are universal; each type has important performance limitations. They all share a difficulty in pumping low molecular weight gases, especially [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[neon]].

The lowest pressure that can be attained in a system is also dependent on many things other than the nature of the pumps. Multiple pumps may be connected in series, called stages, to achieve higher vacuums. The choice of seals, chamber geometry, materials, and pump-down procedures will all have an impact. Collectively, these are called ''vacuum technique''. And sometimes, the final pressure is not the only relevant characteristic. Pumping systems differ in oil contamination, vibration, preferential pumping of certain gases, pump-down speeds, intermittent duty cycle, reliability, or tolerance to high leakage rates.

In [[ultra high vacuum]] systems, some very "odd" leakage paths and outgassing sources must be considered. The water absorption of [[aluminium]] and [[palladium]] becomes an unacceptable source of outgassing, and even the adsorptivity of hard metals such as stainless steel or [[titanium]] must be considered. Some oils and greases will boil off in extreme vacuums. The permeability of the metallic chamber walls may have to be considered, and the grain direction of the metallic flanges should be parallel to the flange face.

The lowest pressures currently achievable in laboratory are about 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; torr (13&amp;nbsp;pPa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ishimaru, H | title= Ultimate Pressure of the Order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; torr in an Aluminum Alloy Vacuum Chamber | journal= Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology | date=1989 | volume=7 | issue=3–II | pages= 2439–2442 | doi= 10.1116/1.575916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, pressures as low as {{val|5|e=-17|u=torr}} (6.7&amp;nbsp;fPa) have been indirectly measured in a 4&amp;nbsp;K cryogenic vacuum system.&lt;ref name=Gabrielse&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.65.1317| pmid = 10042233| title = Thousandfold improvement in the measured antiproton mass| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 65| issue = 11| pages = 1317–1320| year = 1990| last1 = Gabrielse | first1 = G.| last2 = Fei | first2 = X.| last3 = Orozco | first3 = L.| last4 = Tjoelker | first4 = R.| last5 = Haas | first5 = J.| last6 = Kalinowsky | first6 = H.| last7 = Trainor | first7 = T.| last8 = Kells | first8 = W.|bibcode = 1990PhRvL..65.1317G | url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/493773/files/cm-p00043126.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to ≈100 particles/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Cold or oxygen-rich atmospheres can sustain life at pressures much lower than atmospheric, as long as the density of oxygen is similar to that of standard sea-level atmosphere. The colder air temperatures found at altitudes of up to 3&amp;nbsp;km generally compensate for the lower pressures there.&lt;ref name="harding" /&gt; Above this altitude, oxygen enrichment is necessary to prevent [[altitude sickness]] in humans that did not undergo prior [[acclimatization]], and [[spacesuit]]s are necessary to prevent ebullism above 19&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="harding" /&gt;  Most spacesuits use only 20&amp;nbsp;kPa (150&amp;nbsp;Torr) of pure oxygen. This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism, but [[decompression sickness]] and [[air embolism|gas embolisms]] can still occur if decompression rates are not managed.

Rapid decompression can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself. Even if the victim does not hold his or her breath, venting through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal rupture of the delicate [[alveoli]] of the [[lung]]s.&lt;ref name="harding" /&gt; [[Eardrum]]s and sinuses may be ruptured by rapid decompression, soft tissues may bruise and seep blood, and the stress of shock will accelerate oxygen consumption leading to hypoxia.&lt;ref name="Landis Ebullism"&gt;{{cite web| author=Czarnik, Tamarack R.| date=1999|website=unpublished review by Landis, Geoffrey A. | title=EBULLISM AT 1 MILLION FEET: Surviving Rapid/Explosive Decompression | url=http://www.geoffreylandis.com/ebullism.html | publisher= geoffreylandis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Injuries caused by rapid decompression are called [[barotrauma]]. A pressure drop of 13&amp;nbsp;kPa (100&amp;nbsp;Torr), which produces no symptoms if it is gradual, may be fatal if it occurs suddenly.&lt;ref name="harding" /&gt;

[[File:Jacket Wave.ogv|thumb|right|300px|Wave loading on the [[oil platform|steel jacket structure]] of a Production Utilities Quarters Compression (PUQC) platform in the Rong Doi oil field, offshore Vietnam (see [[Oil megaprojects (2010)]]).]]

'''Wave loading''' is most commonly the application of a pulsed or wavelike [[Structural load|load]] to a material or object.  This is most commonly used in the analysis of piping, ships, or building structures which experience wind, water, or [[earthquake|seismic disturbances]].

==Examples of wave loading==
* Offshore storms and pipes: As large waves pass over shallowly buried pipes, [[Fluid pressure|water pressure]] increases above it.  As the trough approaches, pressure over the pipe drops and this sudden and repeated variation in pressure can break pipes.&lt;ref&gt;[[John T. Christian]] et al., “Large Diameter Underwater Pipeline for [[Nuclear power plant|Nuclear Power Plant]] Designed Against [[Soil liquefaction|Soil Liquefaction]],” Offshore Technology Conference Preprints, Vol. 2, [[Houston, Texas]], 6&amp;ndash;8 May 1974, pp. 597&amp;ndash;606.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in pressure for a wave with wave height of about 10 m would be equivalent to one atmosphere (101.3 kPa or 14.7 psi) pressure variation between crest and trough and repeated fluctuations over pipes in relatively shallow environments could set up resonance vibrations within pipes or structures and cause problems.
* Engineering oil platforms: The effects of wave-loading are a serious issue for engineers designing [[oil platform]]s, which must contend with the effects of wave loading, and have devised a number of algorithms to do so.

'''Yoldia Sea''' is a name given by geologists to a variable [[brackish]]-water stage in the [[Baltic Sea]] basin that prevailed after the [[Baltic ice lake]] was drained to sea level during the [[Weichsel glaciation]]. Dates for the Yoldia sea are obtained mainly by radiocarbon dating material from ancient sediments and shore lines and from [[clay-varve chronology]]. 
They tend to vary by as much as a thousand years, but a good estimate is 10,300 – 9500 radiocarbon years BP, equivalent to ca 11,700-10,700 calendar years BP. The sea ended gradually when isostatic rise of [[Scandinavia]] closed or nearly closed its effluents, altering the balance between saline and fresh water. The Yoldia Sea became [[Ancylus Lake]]. The Yoldia Sea stage had three phases of which only the middle phase had brackish water.

The name of the sea is adapted from the obsolete name of the bivalve, ''[[Portlandia arctica]]'' (previously known as ''Yoldia arctica''), found around [[Stockholm]]. This bivalve requires cold saline water. 
It characterizes the middle phase of the Yoldia Sea, during which saline water poured into the Baltic, before the acceleration of glacial melting.

==Description==
[[File:Post-Glacial Sea Level.png|thumb|300px|Post-glacial sea level, combined with isostatic rebound, resulted in a sequence of Baltic lakes and seas.]]
The [[Baltic Ice Lake]], the Yoldia Sea, the [[Ancylus Lake]] and the [[Littorina Sea]] are four recognized stages in the postglacial progression of the Baltic basin – there are also transition periods which can be considered as substages.&lt;ref name=Moerner1995&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Mörner  | first = Nils-Axel   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Baltic Ice Lake-Yoldia Sea transition   | journal = Quaternary International  | volume = 27  | issue =   | pages = 95–98  | publisher = Copyright © 1995 Published by Elsevier Ltd.  | location =   | year = 1995  | url =   | issn =   | doi = 10.1016/1040-6182(94)00065-D      | id =   |bibcode = 1995QuInt..27...95M }}&lt;/ref&gt; From earliest to most recent they run: 
*  The Baltic Ice Lake – fresh water [[proglacial lake]] with level greater than sea level – dammed by glacial ice until the ice dam broke free at the north slope of [[Billingen]] uplands – the lake level then dropped ~ 26 meters to sea level - ~ 10,000 years before the present (BP).&lt;ref name=Moerner1995/&gt;
* Transition period - Between the Baltic Ice Lake and the Yoldia Sea there was a transient lake stage before the ingression of salt water. This lasted ~300 years (292 - 309 annual deposition [[varve]]s are seen in the geologic record, depending on where measured).&lt;ref name=Moerner1995/&gt;
* The Yoldia Sea – a short lived connection with the sea across south-central Sweden over the Närke strait – approximately 10,000 to 9,600 BP.&lt;ref name=Moerner1995/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some variation in the date reconstructions exist among various sources.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Ancylus Lake – creation of a fresh water lake through uplift, which blocked the Närke strait- 9,600 to 7,800 ΒP.&lt;ref name=Moerner1995/&gt;
* The [[Littorina Sea]] – with the rise in sea level and the submergence of the [[Øresund]] strait, the Baltic again communicated with the North Sea beginning ~ 7,800 ΒP to present.&lt;ref name=Moerner1995/&gt;  This is sometimes split into substages:
:* The [[Mastogloia Sea]] -  a substage sometimes used to distinguish the period between 8000 and 7000 years ago when the Baltic became distinctly brackish - during this period the English Channel and the Danish straits circulation was established, increasing Atlantic water inflow.
:* The Limnea Sea – a substage sometimes used to distinguish the transition of the Baltic Sea to a more stagnant phase, which currently exists – about 2,500 BP.&lt;ref name=Moerner1995/&gt;

The Baltic Ice Lake came to an end when it overflowed through central [[Sweden]] and drained, a process complete by about 10,300 BP (radiocarbon years). The straits through the present Stockholm region (via [[Vänern|Lake Vänern]] and the [[Närke|Strait of Närke]]) to the [[Atlantic]] were the only outlet at that time. When lake level reached sea level the difference in salinity caused a backflow from the [[North Sea]], creating saline regions in which the marine bivalve Yoldia flourished. This phase lasted until about 10,000 BP.&lt;ref name=Raukas1995&gt;{{Cite journal   | last = Raukas   | first = Anto   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Evolution of the Yoldia Sea in the eastern Baltic  | journal = Quaternary International  | volume = 27  | issue =   | pages = 99–102  | publisher = Permagon / © 1995 Published by Elsevier Ltd.   | location =   | year = 1995   | url =   | issn = 1040-6182 | doi = 10.1016/1040-6182(94)00066-E  | id =   |bibcode = 1995QuInt..27...99R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, increased melting of the glacier provided additional fresh water and the lake became stratified ([[Meromictic lake|meromictic]]), with salt water on the bottom and fresh on top. Over the life of the sea and from location to location the salinity was a variable. Whether it is possible to speak of stages of salinity that would apply uniformly to the whole sea is debatable.&lt;ref name=Raukas1995/&gt;

At about 10,000 BP, the exit continued to rise and the lake/sea broke through [[Denmark]] creating the first [[Great Belt]] channels. The total opening was less than 1&amp;nbsp;km wide and included two channels at the northern end. The Great Belt channels was blocked again by rising land from the [[post-glacial rebound]] that created Ancylus Lake.&lt;ref name=Raukas1995/&gt;

Geographically, the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] remained under the ice. The [[Gulf of Finland]] was open but most of [[Finland]] was an [[archipelago]], over which debris carried by glacial streams gradually spread. A land bridge joined [[Germany]] to southern Sweden through Denmark. Relieved of its weight of ice, Finland rose gradually and unevenly from the sea. Parts of the Yoldia shoreline are above sea level today while other parts remain below. The Yoldia Sea toward its end was about 30m below current sea level. A channel at the location of the [[Neva River]] connected Yoldia Sea to [[Lake Ladoga]].&lt;ref name=Raukas1995/&gt;

The Yoldia Sea existed entirely within the [[Boreal (period)|Boreal]] [[Blytt-Sernander]] period. The forests and species lining its shores were boreal. [[Mesolithic]] cultures continued to occupy Denmark/south Sweden and the southern shores of the sea. The sea as an ecologic system came to an end when [[Scandinavia]] rose sufficiently to block the flow through the Stockholm area and the saline balance shifted toward a [[Lake|lacustrine]] ecology once again.&lt;ref name=Raukas1995/&gt;
