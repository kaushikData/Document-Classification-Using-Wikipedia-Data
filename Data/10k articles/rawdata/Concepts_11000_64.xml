'''Achintya-Bheda-Abheda''' (अचिन्त्यभेदाभेद, ''{{IAST|acintyabhedābheda}}'' in [[IAST]]) is a school of [[Vedanta]] representing the philosophy of ''inconceivable one-ness and difference''.&lt;ref name=Gupta2007/&gt; In [[Sanskrit]] ''achintya'' means 'inconceivable',&lt;ref name=Gupta2007/&gt; ''bheda'' translates as 'difference', and ''abheda'' translates as 'non-difference'. The [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] religious tradition employs the term in relation to the relationship of creation and creator ([[Krishna]], [[Svayam Bhagavan]]),&lt;ref name=Kaviraja&gt;{{cite book

==Historical perspective==
Historically within [[Hinduism]] there are two conflicting philosophies regarding the relationship between living beings (Jiva or [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atma]]) and God ([[Ishvara]], [[Brahman]] or [[Bhagavan]]). [[Advaita]] schools assert the monistic view that ''the individual soul and God are one and the same'',&lt;ref name="The True Way of Advaita"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tatfoundation.org/forum2006-07.htm |title=Additional information|accessdate=April 16, 2008|publisher=Tatfoundation| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512020519/http://www.tatfoundation.org/forum2006-07.htm| archivedate= 12 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} "This interpretation of the Upanishads, that the individual soul and God are absolutely non-different, is what distinguishes advaita from other forms of Vedanta."&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Dvaita]] schools give the dualistic argument that ''the individual soul and God are eternally separate''.&lt;ref name="Dvaita views"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvaita.org/overview.shtml|title=Additional information|accessdate=April 16, 2008|publisher=dvaita.org| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080412042950/http://www.dvaita.org/overview.shtml| archivedate= 12 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} "Dvaita,... asserts that the difference between the individual soul or Jiva, and the Creator, or Ishvara, is eternal and real"&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of Achintya-bheda-abheda includes elements of both viewpoints. The living soul is intrinsically linked with the Supreme Lord, and yet at the same time is not the same as God - the exact nature of this relationship being inconceivable to the human mind. The spirit Soul is considered to be part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Same in quality but not in quantity. The Supreme Lord Sri Hari having all opulence in fullness, the spirit soul however having only a partial expression of His divine opulence. The Lord in this context is compared to a fire and the spirit souls as sparks coming off of the flame.

==Philosophy==
The theological tenet of ''achintya-bheda-abheda tattva'' reconciles the mystery that God is simultaneously "one with and different from His creation". In this sense [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] [[theology]] is [[panentheistic]] as in no way does it deny the separate existence of God ([[Vishnu]]) in His own personal form. However, at the same time, creation (or what is termed in Vaishnava theology as the 'cosmic manifestation') is never separated from God. He always exercises supreme control over his creation. Sometimes directly, but most of the time indirectly through his different potencies or energies ([[Prakrti]]). Examples are given of a spider and its web; earth and plants that come forth and hair on the body of human being.&lt;ref&gt;''yathorṇa-nābhiḥ sṛjate gṛhṇate ca yathā pṛthivyām oṣadhayaḥ sambhavanti yathā sataḥ puruṣāt keśa-lomāni tathākṣarāt sambhavatīha viśvam'' - Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 1.1.7&lt;/ref&gt;

"One who knows God knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya established His sublime doctrine: acintya bheda-and-abheda-tattva -- simultaneous oneness and difference." ([[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]])&lt;ref name = Prabhupada1972/&gt;
The analogy often used as an explanation in this context in the relationship between the Sun and the Sunshine.&lt;ref name=Prabhupada1988&gt;{{cite book

Qualitatively the Sun and the Sunshine are not different, but as quantities they are very different. This analogy is applied to the living beings and [[God]] - the Jiva being of a similar quality to the Supreme being, but not sharing the qualities to an [[Infinity|infinite]] extent, as would the Personality of Godhead himself.&lt;ref name = Kaviraja2&gt;{{cite book

==Difference in concept to Advaita Vedanta==
It is clearly distinguished from the concept of ''anirvacaniya'' (inexpressible) of [[Advaita Vedanta]]. There is a clear difference between the two concepts  as the two ideas arise for different reasons. [[Advaita]] concept is related to the ontological status of the world, whereas both [[Svayam bhagavan]] and his [[shakti]]s (in Lord himself and his powers) are empirically real, and they are different from each other, but at the same time they are the same. But that does not negate the reality of both.&lt;ref name=Gupta2007/&gt;&lt;ref name = "IST"&gt;{{cite book

==Exceptions==
While it applied to relations between [[Purusha]] (the Lord) and [[Prakriti]] (be it material, marginal, or spiritual powers), in the theology of the concept there are areas of exceptions. [[Jiva Goswami]] also accepts that any object and its energy are non-different, such as fire and power of burning. While some maintain that its only a secondary extension of the principle that it is primarily applied to [[Svayam bhagavan]] and His energies. It does not, however, apply to differences between [[Avatar]]s of [[Svayam bhagavan]] and Lord Himself, so the difference between [[Vishnu]] and His origin, is not covered by the concept of ''acintya bhedabheda'', i.e. it cannot be applied in cases where different levels of [[Purusha]] are compared.&lt;ref name=Gupta2007&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6574">'''Alfred Leo Smith''' (November 6, 1919 - November 19, 2014), also known as '''Al Smith''', was a [[Klamath people|Klamath Nation]] drug and alcohol counselor and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] activist from [[Oregon]].

==Early life==

Smith was born on November 6, 1919 in [[Modoc Point, Oregon]]. He spent his early childhood on the [[Williamson River (Oregon)|Williamson River]].&lt;ref name="klamath-obit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Leo Smith [Obituary]|url=http://klamathtribes.org/news/alfred-leo-smith/|website=Tribal News and Events|publisher=The Klamath Tribes|accessdate=17 July 2016|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age seven, Smith was sent to a nearby Catholic boarding school at the insistence of local Indian agents.  He was ultimately sent to a mix of catholic schools and [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] schools, as far away as [[Beaverton, Oregon]] and [[Stewart Indian School]] in Nevada.  After leaving [[Chemawa Indian School]], he began to live in [[Portland, Oregon]] as an alcoholic panhandler.  He was drafted during [[World War II]] and was sent to federal prison for drinking on duty.  He survived a bout of [[tuberculosis]], and experienced the 1942 death of his sister and 1950 death of his mother.&lt;ref name="unknown-god"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epps|first1=Garrett|title=To an unknown God: religious freedom on trial|date=2001|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0312262396|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/e/epps-unknown.html|accessdate=17 July 2016|chapter=A God I didn't understand}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Congress also voted to [[Klamath Termination Act|terminate the Klamath Nation]] in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=Klamath Termination Act|type=Public Law|number=587|date=13 August 1954|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-68/pdf/STATUTE-68-Pg718.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; striking another blow against Smith.

In 1957, Smith became sober with the help of an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] program, ultimately celebrating 56 years of sobriety.  He also became interested in Native recovery through culturally relevant practices and indigenous spirituality.&lt;ref name="klamath-obit" /&gt;

==Professional life==

Smith began working for the Portland Alcoholism Counseling and Recovery Program, helping alcoholics in a community he knew well.  In 1972, the Bureau of Indian Affairs hired Smith to set up a number of tribal treatment programs across the United States.  He also worked in the Klamath Basin on drug and alcohol recovery issues, where he was able to reconnect with his heritage and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Urofsky|editor1-first=Melvin I.|title=100 Americans making constitutional history a biographical history|date=2004|publisher=CQ Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1452267251|pages=187–9|chapter=Al Smith: the free exercise of religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Al Smith began to work at Sweathouse Lodge, part of the [[Camp Adair#Chicano-Indian Study Center of Oregon|Chicano-Indian Study Center of Oregon]] founded on the site of [[Camp Adair]].  His position as treatment coordinator allowed him to combine AA principles with traditional Native spiritual practices, particularly the daily [[sweat lodge]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Epps|first1=Garrett|title=Peyote vs. the state : religious freedom on trial|date=2009|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=0806140267|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Employment Division v. Smith''==
{{main|Employment Division v. Smith}}
In 1982, Smith began working at a nonprofit Drug and Alcohol counseling program in [[Roseburg, Oregon]].  After his colleague Galen Black was fired for ingesting [[peyote]], Smith indignantly attended a ceremony of the [[Native American Church]], declaring "You can't tell me that I can't go to church!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Epps|first1=Garrett|title=Al Smith: Elegy for a Hero of Religious Freedom|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/12/elegy-for-an-american-hero-al-smith-smith-employment-division-supreme-court/383582/|website=Atlantic|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was fired for using peyote as part of the ceremony. At the time, intentional possession of peyote was a crime under Oregon law without an [[affirmative defense]] for religious use. The counselors filed a claim for unemployment compensation with the state, but the claim was denied because the reason for their dismissal was deemed work-related "misconduct." The [[Oregon Court of Appeals]] reversed that ruling, holding that denying them unemployment benefits for their religious use of peyote violated their right to exercise their religion. The [[Oregon Supreme Court]] agreed, although it relied not on the fact that peyote use was a crime but on the fact that the state's justification for withholding the benefits&amp;mdash;preserving the "financial integrity" of the workers' compensation fund&amp;mdash;was outweighed by the burden imposed on the employees' exercise of their religion. The state appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, again arguing that denying the unemployment benefits was proper because possession of peyote was a crime.

The U.S. Supreme Court let stand the Oregon Supreme Court's judgment against the two employees and returned the case to the Oregon courts to determine whether or not sacramental use of illegal drugs violated Oregon's state drug laws (485 U.S. 660 (1988)).  Writing for the majority, [[Antonin Scalia]] declared that the free exercise of religion did not protect minority religions from "neutral, generally applicable laws."  Scalia believed that "...[l]eaving accommodation to the political process will place at a relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in, but that unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be preferred to a system in which each conscience is a law unto itself or in which judges weigh the social importance of all laws against the centrality of all religious beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scalia|first1=Antonin|title=Employment Division v.

'''Bad faith''' ([[French language|French]]: ''mauvaise foi'') is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept utilized by [[existentialist]] philosophers [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to describe the phenomenon in which human beings, under pressure from social forces, adopt false values and disown their innate freedom, hence acting [[Authenticity (philosophy)|inauthentically]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the concepts of [[self-deception]] and ''[[ressentiment]]''.

==Freedom and choice==
A critical claim in [[existentialism|existentialist]] thought is that individuals are always [[Free will|free to make choices]] and guide their lives towards their own chosen goal or "project". The claim holds that individuals cannot escape this freedom, even in overwhelming circumstances. For instance, even an empire's colonized victims possess choices: to submit to rule, to negotiate, to commit suicide, to resist nonviolently, or to counter-attack.

Although external circumstances may limit individuals (this limitation from the outside is called [[facticity]]), they cannot force a person to follow one of the remaining courses over another. In this sense the individual still has some freedom of choice. For this reason, individuals choose in ''[[anguish]]'': they know that they must make a choice, and that it will have consequences. For Sartre, to claim that one amongst many conscious possibilities takes undeniable precedence (for instance, "I cannot risk my life, because I must support my family") is to assume the role of an object in the world, not a free agent, but merely at the mercy of circumstance (a ''[[being-in-itself]]'' that is only its own facticity, i.e., it "is" inside itself, and acts there as a limitation).&lt;ref&gt;Jack Reynolds, ''Understanding Existentialism'' (2006) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;. For Sartre, this attitude is manifestly self-deceiving. 

==Intentional consciousness and freedom==
As conscious humans, we are always aware that we are more than what we are aware of, so we are not whatever we are aware of. We cannot, in this sense, be defined as our "intentional objects" of consciousness, including our restrictions imposed by (facticity) our personal history, character, bodies, or objective responsibility. Thus, as Sartre often repeated, "Human reality is what it is not, and it is not what it is." An example of what he means is being a doctor but wishing to "transcend" that to become a pig farmer. One is who one is not: a pig farmer, not who one is, a doctor. 

One can only define oneself negatively, as "what it is not", and this negation is the only positive definition of "what it is."

From this we are aware of a host of alternative reactions to our freedom to choose an objective situation, since no situation can dictate a single response. We pretend that these possibilities are denied to us by assuming social roles and value systems external to this nature {{clarification needed|date=June 2018}}. But this is itself a decision made possible by our freedom and our separation from these things. 

"Bad faith" is the paradoxical free decision to deny to ourselves this inescapable freedom.

==Examples==
===Sartre===
Sartre cites a café waiter, whose movements and conversation are a little too "waiter-esque". His voice oozes with an eagerness to please; he carries food rigidly and ostentatiously; "his movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid".&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, quoted in [[R. D. Laing]], ''Self and Others'' (1969) p 44&lt;/ref&gt; His exaggerated behaviour illustrates that he is play acting as a waiter, as an object in the world: an automaton whose essence is to be a waiter. But that he is obviously acting belies that he is aware that he is not (merely) a waiter, but is rather consciously deceiving himself.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul, ''Essays in Existentialism'', Citadel Press. 1993, pp. 167-169&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Sartre's examples involves a young woman on a first date. She ignores the obvious sexual implications of her date's compliments to her physical appearance, but accepts them instead as words directed at her as a human consciousness. As he takes her hand, she lets it rest indifferently in his, "neither consenting nor resisting&amp;nbsp;– a thing"&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, quoted in [[Erving Goffman]], ''Relations in Public'' (1972)in p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– refusing either to return the gesture or to rebuke it. Thus she delays the moment when she must choose either to acknowledge and reject his advances, or submit to them. She conveniently considers her hand only a thing in the world, and his compliments as unrelated to her body, playing on her dual human reality as a physical being, and as a consciousness separate and free from this physicality.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul, ''Essays in Existentialism'', Citadel Press. 1993, pp. 160-164&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre suggests that by acting in bad faith the waiter and the woman are denying their own freedom, but by actively using this freedom itself. They manifestly know they are free, but refuse to acknowledge it. Bad faith is paradoxical in this regard: when acting in bad faith, a person is actively denying their own freedom, however rely on it to perform the denial.

===De Beauvoir===
De Beauvoir described three main types of women acting in bad faith: the ''[[Narcissist]]'' who denies her freedom by construing herself as a desirable object; the ''Mystic'', who invests her freedom in an absolute; and the ''Woman in Love'', who submerges her identity in that of her male object.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

She also considered what she called the ''Serious Man'', who subordinated himself to some outside cause, to be in bad faith inasmuch as he denies his own freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 150 and p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two modes of consciousness==
Sartre claims that the consciousness with which we generally consider our surroundings is different from our reflecting on this consciousness, i.e., the consciousness of "ourselves being conscious of these surroundings". The first kind of consciousness, before we think about, or reflect on, our previous consciousness, is called ''pre-reflective''. Reflecting on the pre-reflective consciousness is called ''reflective'' consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/sartre-ex/#SH3a|title=Sartre, Jean Paul: Existentialism - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this cannot be called unconsciousness, as Freud used the term. Sartre gives the example of running after a bus: one does not become conscious of "one's running after the bus" until one has ceased to run after it, because until then one's consciousness is focused on the bus itself, and not one's chasing it.

In this sense consciousness always [[logical consequence|entails]] being self-aware (''being for-itself''). Since for Sartre consciousness also entails a consciousness of our separation from the world, and hence freedom, we are also always aware of this. But we can manipulate these two levels of consciousness, so that our reflective consciousness interprets the factual limits of our objective situation as insurmountable, whilst our pre-reflective consciousness remains aware of alternatives.

==Freedom and morality==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
One convinces oneself, in some sense, to be bound to act by external circumstance, in order to escape the anguish of freedom. Sartre says that man is "condemned to be free": whether he adopts an "objective" moral system to do this choosing for him, or follows only his pragmatic concerns, he cannot help but be aware that they are not&amp;nbsp;– fundamentally&amp;nbsp;– part of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/80180903|title=Existentialism is a Humanism|last=Sartre|first=Jean-Paul|publisher=Yale University Press|others=|year=2007|isbn=9780300115468|location=New Haven|pages=29|oclc=80180903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as possible intentional objects of one's consciousness, one is fundamentally ''not'' part of oneself, but rather exactly what one, as consciousness, defines oneself in opposition to; along with everything else one could be conscious of.

Fundamentally, Sartre believes mankind cannot escape responsibility by adopting an external moral system, as the adoption of such is in itself a choice that we endorse, implicitly or explicitly, for which we must take full responsibility. Sartre argues that one cannot escape this responsibility, as each attempt to part one's self from the freedom of choice is in itself a demonstration of choice, and choice is dependent on a person's wills and desires.

As a human, one cannot claim his actions are determined by external forces; this is the core statement of existentialism. One is "condemned" to this eternal freedom; human beings exist before the definition of human identity exists. One cannot define oneself as a thing in the world, as one has the freedom to be otherwise. One is not "a philosopher", as at some point one must/will cease the activities that define the self as "a philosopher". Any role that one might adopt does not define one as there is an eventual end to one's adoption of the role; i.e. other roles will be assigned to us, "a chef", "a mother". The self is not constant, it cannot be a thing in the world. Though one cannot assign a positive value to definitions that may apply to oneself, one remains able to say what one is not.

This inner anguish over moral uncertainty is a central underlying theme in existentialism, as the anguish demonstrates a personal feeling of responsibility over the choices one makes throughout life. Without an emphasis on personal choice, one may make use of an external moral system as a tool to moralize otherwise immoral acts, leading to negation of the self. According to existentialism, dedicated professionals of their respective moral codes&amp;nbsp;– priests interpreting sacred scriptures, lawyers interpreting the [[Constitution]], doctors interpreting the [[Hippocratic oath]]&amp;nbsp;– should, instead of divesting the self of responsibility in the discharge of one's duties, be aware of one's own significance in the process. This recognition involves the questioning of the morality of all choices, taking responsibility for the consequences of one's own choice and therefore; a constant reappraisal of one's own and others' ever-changing humanity. One must not exercise bad faith by denying the self's freedom of choice and accountability. Taking on the burden of personal accountability in all situations is an intimidating proposition&amp;nbsp;– by pointing out the freedom of the individual, Sartre seeks to demonstrate that the social roles and moral systems we adopt protect us from being morally accountable for our actions.

'''Biological functionalism''' is an [[anthropological]] paradigm, asserting that all [[social organisation|social institutions]], beliefs, values and practices serve to address pragmatic concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~n51ls801/340life.html |title=The Meaning of "Life" |author=Austin, D.F. |year=2000 |accessdate=23 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624005750/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~n51ls801/340life.html |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the theorem derives from the longer-established [[structural functionalism]], yet the two theorems diverge from one another significantly.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-rathouse.com/EvenMoreAustrianProgram/EMACulturevsGMProg.html |title=Comparing "The Strong Program in Cultural Theory |accessdate=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both maintain the fundamental belief that a [[social structure]] is composed of many interdependent [[frame of reference|frames of reference]], biological functionalists criticise the structural view that a [[solidarity (sociology)|social solidarity]] and collective conscience is required in a functioning system.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; By that fact, biological functionalism maintains that our individual survival and health is the driving provocation of actions, and that the importance of social rigidity is negligible.

==Everyday application==
Although the actions of humans without doubt do not always engender positive results for the individual, a biological functionalist would argue that the intention was still [[self-preservation]], albeit unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/basic_needs.pdf |title=Biological Adaptation in Human Societies: A 'Basic Needs' Approach |author=Corning, Peter A. |accessdate=23 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725082133/http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/basic_needs.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the belief in luck as an entity; while a disproportionately strong belief in good luck may lead to undesirable results, such as a huge loss in money from gambling, biological functionalism maintains that the newly created ability of the gambler to condemn luck will allow them to be free of individual blame, thus serving a practical and individual purpose. In this sense, biological functionalism maintains that while bad results often occur in life, which do not serve any pragmatic concerns, an entrenched [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychological]] motivation was attempting to create a positive result, in spite of its eventual failure.

The "'''body without organs'''" ({{lang-fr|corps sans organes}}) is a concept used by French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]]. It usually refers to the deeper reality underlying some well-formed whole constructed from fully functioning parts. At the same time, it may also describe a relationship to one's literal body.

Deleuze began using the term in ''[[The Logic of Sense]]'' (1969), while discussing the experiences of playwright [[Antonin Artaud]]. "Body without Organs" (or "BwO") later became a major part of the vocabulary for ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'', two volumes (''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' [1972] and ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' [1980]) written collaboratively with [[Félix Guattari]]. In these works, the term took on an expanded meaning, referring variously to literal bodies and to a certain perspective on realities of any type. The term's overloaded meaning is provocative, perhaps intentionally.&lt;ref name=Colombat1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colombat|first=André Pierre|title=A Thousand Trails to Work with Deleuze|journal=SubStance|year=1991|issue=66|quote=The juxtaposition of these two incompatible fields and explanations creates a non-sense, an excess of sense, that puts in motion the intellect and the imagination of the reader.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early uses==

The term originates from [[Antonin Artaud]]'s radio play ''To Have Done with the Judgment of God'' (1947):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When you will have made him a body without organs, &lt;br /&gt;
then you will have delivered him from all his automatic reactions &lt;br /&gt;
and restored him to his true freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonin Artaud]]. "To Have Done with the Judgment of God" in ''Selected Writings''.  [[Susan Sontag]] (ed).  Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1976, p. 571.  {{oclc|473004317}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Deleuze first mentions the phrase in a chapter of ''[[The Logic of Sense]]'' called "The Schizophrenic and the Little Girl", which contrasts two distinct and peripheral ways of encountering the world. The Little Girl (whose exemplar is Alice), explores a world of 'surfaces': the shifting realm of social appearances and nonsense words which nevertheless seem to function. The Schizophrenic (whose exemplar is Artaud) is by contrast an explorer of 'depths', one who rejects the surface entirely and returns instead to the body.

For the Schizophrenic, words collapse, not into nonsense, but into the bodies that produce and hear them. Deleuze refers to "a new dimension of the schizophrenic body, an organism without parts which operates entirely by insufflation, respiration, evaporation and fluid transmission (the superior body or body without organs of Antonin Artaud)."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, ''The Logic of Sense'', p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; This body is also described as "howling", speaking a "language without articulation" that has more to do with the primal act of making sound than it does with communicating specific words.&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, ''The Logic of Sense'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Capitalism and Schizophrenia''==

In Deleuze and Guattari's collaboration, the term describes an undifferentiated, unhierarchical realm that lies deeper than the world of appearances. It relates to the proto-world described in the mythology of many different cultures.&lt;ref name="Colebrook 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Colebrook|first=Claire|title=Understanding Deleuze|year=2002|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest, N.S.W.|isbn=1865087971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deleuze and Guattari often use the example of the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] egg, based primarily on anthropological reports from [[Marcel Griaule]]. Describing the Dogon story of the origins of the cosmos, Griaule writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These primordial movements are conceived in terms of an ovoid form—'the egg of the world' (''aduno tal'')—within which lie, already differentiated, the germs of things; in consequence of the spiral movement of extension the germs develop first in seven segments of increasing length, representing the seven fundamental seeds of cultivation, which are to be found again in the human body [...]&lt;ref name="Griaule Dieterien 1954"&gt;{{cite book|title=African worlds; studies in the cosmological ideas and social values of African peoples.|year=1954 |origyear=1999|publisher=LIT Verlag|isbn=3825830861|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/5007776/Marcel-Griaule-The-Dogon|author=Marcel Griaule|author2=Germaine Dieterlen|editor=Cyril Daryll Forde|chapter=The Dogon|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Griaule, the basic patterns of organization within the egg reappear within all domains of Dogon life: kinship structures, village layout, understanding of the body, and so forth. The egg metaphor helps to suggest the gestation of a formation yet to come, and the potential formation of many actualities from a single origin.

===''Anti-Oedipus''===

[[File:Schleiden-vogel.jpg|thumb|Tiny differentiations in the developing egg designate major differences in the final creature.]]

In ''Anti-Oedipus'' Deleuze and Guattari expand the Body without Organs image by comparing its real potentials to the egg's : &lt;blockquote&gt;The body without organs is an egg: it is crisscrossed with axes and thresholds, with latitudes and longitudes and geodesic lines, traversed by gradients marking the transitions and the becomings, the destinations of the subject developing along these particular vectors (''Capitalism and Schizophrenia'', p.&amp;nbsp;19).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Deleuze and Guattari, every actual body has a limited set of traits, habits, movements, affects, etc. But every actual body also has a [[Virtuality (philosophy)|virtual]] dimension: a vast reservoir of potential traits, connections, affects, movements, etc. This collection of potentials is what Deleuze calls the BwO. The full body without organs is "schizophrenia as a clinical entity" (''Anti-Oedipus,'' p. 310). This drop in intensity is a means of blocking all investments of reality: "the unproductive, the sterile, the unengendered, the unconsumable" (''Anti-Oedipus,'' p. 9). Unlike other social machines such as the Body of the Earth, the Body of the Despot or the Body of Capital, the full body without organs cannot inscribe other bodies. The body without organs is "not an original primordial entity" (proof of an original nothingness) nor what is remains of a lost totality but is the "ultimate residue of a deterritorialized socius" (''Anti-Oedipus,'' p. 309). To "make oneself a body without organs," then, is to actively experiment with oneself to draw out and activate these virtual potentials. These potentials are mostly activated (or "actualized") through conjunctions with other bodies (or BwOs) that Deleuze calls "becomings."

Deleuze and Guattari use the term BwO in an extended sense, to refer to the virtual dimension of reality in general (which they more often call "plane of consistency" or "[[plane of immanence]]"). In this sense, they speak of a BwO of "the earth." "The Earth," they write, "is a body without organs. This body without organs is permeated by unformed, unstable matters, by flows in all directions, by free intensities or nomadic singularities, by mad or transitory particles" (''A Thousand Plateaus'', p.&amp;nbsp;40). That is, we usually think of the world as composed of relatively stable entities ("bodies," beings). But these bodies are really composed of sets of flows moving at various speeds (rocks and mountains as very slow-moving flows; living things as flows of biological material through developmental systems; language as flows of information, words, etc.). This fluid substratum is what Deleuze calls the BwO in a general sense.

=== ''A Thousand Plateaus'' ===

In ''A Thousand Plateaus'', Deleuze and Guattari eventually differentiate between three kinds of ''BwO'': cancerous, empty, and full. Roughly, the empty ''BwO'' is the ''BwO'' of ''Anti-Oedipus''.  This ''BwO'' is also described as "catatonic" because it is completely de-organ-ized; all flows pass through it freely, with no stopping, and no directing. Even though any form of [[Desiring-production|desire can be produced]] on it, the empty ''BwO'' is non-productive. The full ''BwO'' is the healthy ''BwO''; it is productive, but not petrified in its organ-ization. The cancerous ''BwO'' is caught in a pattern of endless reproduction of the self-same pattern. They give a rough recipe for building yourself a healthy BwO:

{{bq |text=This is how it should be done. Lodge yourself on a stratum, experiment with the opportunities it offers, find an advantageous place on it, find potential movements of deterritorialization, possible lines of flight, experience them, produce flow conjunctions here and there, try out continua of intensities segment by segment, have a small plot of new land at all times. It is through a meticulous relation with the strata that one succeeds in freeing lines of flight, causing conjugated flows to pass and escape and bringing forth continuous intensities for a BwO. (Deleuze &amp; Guattari, ''A Thousand Plateaus'', 1980/1987, p. 161)}}

Deleuze and Guattari suggest restraint here, writing that drug addicts and masochists may come closer to truly possessing bodies without organs—and die as a result. The 'healthy BwO' thus envisions the actual body without organs as a horizon, not a goal.&lt;ref name="Buchanan 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Ian|title=The Problem of the Body in Deleuze and Guattari, Or, What Can a Body Do?|journal=Body &amp; Society|date=1 September 1997|volume=3|issue=73|pages=73–91|doi=10.1177/1357034X97003003004|url=http://bod.sagepub.com/content/3/3/73|accessdate=31 August 2012|quote=Through their activities, the masochist, the anorexic or alcoholic, reduces his or her capacity for affection. Accordingly, their plateau of intensity, which is singular, and therefore incapable of making new connections or entering into new compositions, is ''reactive'', deadly. The body, in other words, is not and cannot be a body without organs, but must forever grapple with the BwO as its conduit to the real.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burak Arıkan''' (born in 1976, Istanbul) is a Turkish contemporary artist working with complex networks raising questions about economic, political, societal issues. His work is research-based, thus generates data and inputs into custom abstract machinery, builds network maps, results in performances, and procreates predictions to make inherent power relationships visible, thus discussable.

Arikan is the founder of Graph Commons, a platform for mapping, analyzing, and publishing data-networks. Graph Commons workshop for artists,&lt;ref&gt;http://teaching.burak-arikan.com/creative-networking/ Creative Networking Workshops&lt;/ref&gt; activists, critical researchers, and civil society organizations are being conducted internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://civilsocietydialogue.blogspot.com NGO Network Mapping Workshops&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Arikan's works MyPocket (2008)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.turbulence.org/Works/mypocket/ MYPOCKET (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; is a live software system that predicts what the artist buys every day and discloses his spending records to the world.

{{Marxism}}

In [[Marxist philosophy]], a '''character mask''' ({{lang-de|Charaktermaske}}) is a prescribed social role that serves to conceal the contradictions of a social relation or order. The term was used by [[Karl Marx]] in various published writings from the 1840s to the 1860s, and also by [[Friedrich Engels]]. It is related to the classical Greek concepts of [[mimesis]] (imitative representation using analogies) and [[prosopopoeia]] (impersonation or [[personification]]) as well as the Roman concept of [[persona]],&lt;ref&gt;A famous anthropological essay on the idea of the "persona" is Marcel Mauss, "A category of the human mind: the notion of person, the notion of 'self'." in: Mauss, ''Sociology and psychology: essays''. Translated by Ben Brewster. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979. See, for a recent discussion of the concept of persona: Marta Cecilia Betancur García (Universidad de Caldas), "Persona y máscara", ''Praxis Filosófica'', Nueva serie, no. 30, January–June 2010: pp. 7–16. [http://praxis.univalle.edu.co/numeros/n30/PraxisFilosofica30_MCBetancur.pdf Praxi.univalle.edu.co]&lt;/ref&gt; but also differs from them (see below).&lt;ref&gt;The Greek concept of [[prosopon]], meaning "the face", literally is "that which is set before the eyes", and thus also refers to "a mask" (John Mack (ed.), ''Masks: the art of expression''. London: British Museum, 1994, p. 151). In Greek theatre, the function of the mask was impersonate a character. In post-Freudian psychology, by contrast, the mask is a metaphor for the external self, concealing the reality within (ibid., p. 151-152, 157).&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of character masks has been used by [[neo-Marxist]] and non-Marxist sociologists,&lt;ref&gt;The neo-Marxists referring to character masks were especially those of the [[Frankfurt School]], such as [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]]. For a non-Marxist approach to character masks, see [[Anthony Giddens]], ''The constitution of society: outline of the theory of structuration''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; philosophers&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Alasdair Macintyre]], ''[[After Virtue]]''. University of Notre Dame Press, 2007, pp. 27–35, 109–110; [[Peter Sloterdijk]], ''Critique of Cynical Reason''. Verso, 1988, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; and anthropologists&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Lawrence Krader]], [[David Graeber]]&lt;/ref&gt; to interpret how people relate in societies with a complex [[division of labour]], where people depend on trade to meet many of their needs. Marx's own notion of the character mask was not a fixed idea with a singular definition.

==Versus social masks==
As a psychological term, "character" is traditionally used more in continental Europe, while in Britain and North America the term "personality" is used in approximately the same contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon W. Allport]], "My encounters with personality theory". Recorded and edited reminiscence at the Boston University School of Theology, October 12, 1962, transcribed by W. Douglas, p. 1. As cited by Christopher F. Monte and Robert N. Sollod, ''Beneath the mask. An introduction to theories of personality'', 7th edition. Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003, p. 2. A Marxist interpretation of character is provided by Kit R. Christensen, ''The Politics of Character Development: A Marxist Reappraisal of the Moral Life''. Praeger, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx however uses the term "character mask" analogously to a theatrical role, where the actor (or the characteristics of a [[Theatrical property|prop]]) represents a certain interest or function, and intends by character both "the characteristics of somebody" and "the characteristics of something". Marx's metaphorical use of the term "character masks" refers back to carnival masks and the masks used in classical Greek theatre. At issue is the social form in which a practice is acted out.

A sophisticated academic language for talking about the sociology of roles did not exist in the mid-19th century. Marx therefore borrowed from theatre and literature to express his idea.&lt;ref&gt;Edith Hall, ''The theatrical cast of Athens; interactions between ancient Greek drama &amp; society''. Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[György Lukács]] pioneered a sociology of drama in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;George Lukács, "The Sociology of Modern Drama" (transl. Lee Baxandall), ''The Tulane Drama Review'', 1965, Vol.9(4), pp.146–170.&lt;/ref&gt; a sociology of roles began only in the 1930s, and a specific sociology of theatre (e.g. by [[Jean Duvignaud]]) first emerged in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth and Tom Burns, ''Sociology of Literature and Drama''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx's concept is both that an identity appears differently from its true identity (it is masked or disguised), and that this difference has very real practical consequences (the mask is not simply a decoration, but performs a real function and has real effects, even independently of the mask bearer).

The nearest equivalent term in modern English for Marx's "character masks" is social masks. However, such a translation is not entirely satisfactory, for several reasons:
*A "social mask" is normally understood only as the mask of an individual, while Marx's concept of character masks has been applied by Marxists and non-Marxists to persons and politicians,&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Ronald W. Clark]], ''[[Lenin]]: the man behind the mask''. New York: St Martins Press, 1989; Gary Allen, ''Richard Nixon: The Man Behind The Mask''. Boston: Western Islands, 1971 (see also [[Richard Nixon mask]]; Adam Robinson, ''Bin Laden: behind the mask of the terrorist''. Edinburgh: Mainstream, 2001. Nick Henck, ''Subcommander Marcos: the man and the mask''. Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social group|group]]s and [[social classes]], [[mass media]], [[social movements]] and [[political parties]], [[social institutions]], organizations and functions, governments, symbolic expressions, historical eras, and dramatic, literary or theatrical contexts. In each case, the suggestion is that matters present themselves other than they really are.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Ingo Elbe, "Thesen zum Begriff der Charaktermaske" [http://www.rote-ruhr-uni.com/texte/elbe_charaktermaske.pdf ''Rote Ruhr Uni'' site.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Marx's character masks are a specific kind of social masks, i.e. masks of people and things which represent a social, political, intellectual or economic function, within the given social relationships among groups of people. The category of "social masks" is much more general and inclusive.
*With Marx's character masks, it is understood that they are bound up with a specific type of society at a specific historical time, and with a specific theory of how the social relations in that society function. By contrast, the general concept of "social masks" assumes no specific theory, specific society or specific historical time; social masks of whatever form can be assumed to have existed forever and a day, and thus are treated as a more or less permanent part of the human condition.

=="False awareness"==
There is a link between character masks and the concept of deliberate misrepresentation and [[hypocrisy]].&lt;ref&gt;Anne Duncan, ''Performance and identity in the classical world''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet character masks need not be hypocritical, insofar as the motive for their use is genuine, sincere, principled or naive – or a product of (self-)delusion. People can also mask their behavior, or mask a situation, without being aware that they are doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Rumsfeld]]: "Reports that say that something has not happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we do not know we do not know." – [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] ''news briefing'', February 12, 2002. Rumsfeld leaves out "the things we do not know that we know", perhaps "do not want to know about ourselves" and therefore ''mask'' to ourselves – giving rise to the possibility of being "unconsciously conscious" or "consciously unconscious", a theme explored by [[Sigmund Freud]] and his school. See further: [[John Keegan]], ''The mask of command''. New York : Viking, 1987. Engels's German expression "falsch Bewusstsein" is correctly translated as "false awareness", not as "false consciousness".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Ricœur]] explains:

{{Quotation|What distinguishes false-consciousness from error or falsehood, and what motivates a particular kind of critique, of denunciation, is the possibility of signifying another thing than one believes was signified, that is, the possibility of the masked consciousness. These two words, "false consciousness," pertain usually to Marx... Consciousness, far from being transparent in itself, is at the same time what reveals and what conceals; it is this relation of conceal/reveal which calls for a specific reading, a ''[[hermeneutics]]''. The task of hermeneutics... has always been to read a text and to distinguish the true sense from the apparent sense, to search for the sense under the sense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Ricœur]], "The critique of religion", in ''The philosophy of Paul Ricoeur. An Anthology of his Work''. Boston: Beacon Press, 1978, p. 215. Cited in Richard Kearney, ''On Paul Ricoeur: the owl of Minerva''. London: Ashgate, 2004, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The "false awareness" (''falsches Bewusstsein'') in the classical sense used by [[Friedrich Engels]] does not necessarily refer to "errors" in the content of awareness. It refers rather to an ''absence of awareness'' of what is really behind the ideas being worked with, how they have originated, or what the real role or effect of the ideas is. The first result of that is, that the ideologists believe themselves to be performing certain intellectual operations with regard to an issue, which, in reality, have quite a different significance than what they imagine. The second result is that their intellectual creations can then function as a mask for what is really at stake, precisely because the issue is portrayed in a one-sided or distorted way – without the ideologists being aware of how that works. The ideologists are aware and unaware at the same time. The problem, says Engels, is that they exaggerate the power of ideas, even to the point where ideas seem to be the cause of all that happens. This occurs especially if the intellectual productions occur at quite some distance from the practical context to which they properly refer, or if they concern specialized, highly abstract ideas which cannot easily be verified&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm Letter of Friedrich Engels to Franz Mehring, 14 July 1893]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of masking==

===Historical===
The "character masks of an era" refer, according to Marx and Engels, to its main symbolic expressions of self-justification or [[apologist]], the function of which is to ''disguise'', ''[[embellish]]'' or ''mystify'' social contradictions ("the bits that do not fit"). A purported "mystical truth" in this context is a meaning which cannot be definitely proved, because it results from an abstract procedure or cognition which is not logical, and cannot be tested scientifically, only subjectively experienced.

[[Terry Eagleton]] explains:

{{Quotation|A dominant power may legitimate itself by promoting beliefs and values congenial to it; naturalizing and universalizing such beliefs so as to render them self-evident and apparently inevitable; denigrating ideas which might challenge it; excluding rival forms of thought, perhaps by some unspoken but systematic logic; and obscuring social reality in ways convenient to itself. Such `mystification', as it is commonly known, frequently takes the form of masking&lt;ref&gt;Terry Eagleton, ''Ideology: An Introduction''. London: Verso, 1991, pp.5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Economic===
Marx also argues that, insofar as capitalist class society is intrinsically a very contradictory system – it contains many conflicting and competing forces – the masking of its true characteristics becomes an integral feature of how it actually operates. Buyers and sellers compete with other buyers and sellers. Businesses cannot practically do so without confidentiality and secrecy. Workers compete for job opportunities and access to resources. Capitalists and workers compete for their share of the new wealth that is produced, and nations compete with other nations. The masks are therefore not optional, but necessary, and the more one is able to know about others, the more subtle, ingenious and sophisticated the masks become.

One of the centerpieces of Marx's critique of political economy is that the juridical labour contract between the worker and his capitalist employer obscures the true economic relationship, which is (according to Marx) that the workers do not sell their labor, but their [[labor power]], making possible a profitable difference between what they are paid and the new value they create for the owners of capital (a form of economic exploitation). Thus, the very foundation of capitalist wealth creation involves – as Marx says explicitly – a "mask".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Value, Price and Profit'', part 9.[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/ch02.htm#c7 Marxists.org]; [[Karl Marx]], ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'' (1875), part 2 (emphases added). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch02.htm Marxists.org] Cf. the ''Resultate'' manuscript in ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', Penguin edition, p. 1064, where Marx uses the word "''vertuscht''" ("covered up").&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, Marx argues that transactions in the capitalist economy are often far from transparent – they appear different from what they really are. This is discovered, only when one probes the total context in which they occur. Hence Marx writes:

{{Quotation|Vulgar economics actually does nothing more than to interpret, to systematize and turn into apologetics – in a doctrinaire way – the ideas of the agents who are trapped within bourgeois [[relations of production]]. So it should not surprise us that, precisely within the estranged form of appearance of economic relations in which these ''prima facie'' absurd and complete contradictions occur – and all science would be superfluous if the form of appearance of things directly coincided with their essence – that precisely here vulgar economics feels completely at home, and that these relationships appear all the more self-evident to it, the more their inner interconnection remains hidden to it, even though these relationships are comprehensible to the popular mind&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume III]]'', Penguin edition, p. 956 (translation corrected according to the German edition).&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This implies another level of masking, because the economic character masks are then straightforwardly ("vulgarly") equated with [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] behaviour. The effect in this case is, that the theory of "how the economy works" masks how it actually works, by conflating its surface appearance with its real nature. Its generalities ''seem'' to explain it, but in reality they do not. The theory is therefore (ultimately) ''arbitrary''. Either things are studied in isolation from the total context in which they occur, or generalizations are formed which leave essential bits out. Such distortion can certainly be ideologically useful to justify an [[economic system]], position or policy as a good thing, but it can become a hindrance to understanding.&lt;ref&gt;For a commentary by a Marxian economist, see: Duncan K. Foley, ''[http://homepage.newschool.edu/~foleyd/ecagent.pdf The strange history of the economic agent] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322055825/http://homepage.newschool.edu/~foleyd/ecagent.pdf |date=March 22, 2011 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

===Masks as mediators of social contradictions===
Abstractly, the masking processes specific to capitalist society mediate and reconcile social contradictions, which arise from three main sources:

* [[relations of production]] (ownership relations governing the [[factors of production]], defined by property rights, and work roles), which create and maintain a class-divided society, in which citizens are formally equal under the law but unequal in reality; class interests are represented as the general interest and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Leopold Neumann]], ''The democratic and the authoritarian state: Essays in political and legal theory''. Free Press, 1957, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The state formally serves "the general interest" of society, but in reality it mainly serves the general interest of the [[ruling class]], and more specifically what the [[elite]], the [[polity]] or the [[political class]] ''considers'' to be the general interest of society.
* relations of exchange in the marketplace,&lt;ref&gt;Marx analyzes the social meaning of exchange relations in the ''[[Grundrisse]]'', Penguin ed., pp. 242–245. [[Evgeny Pashukanis]] argues that "The egoistic subject, the subject of a right and the moral personality are the three basic masks under which man appears in commodity production." – Pashukanis, ''Law and Marxism: a general theory''. Ink Links, 1978, chapter 6.
 [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1924/law/ch06.htm Marxists.org]&lt;/ref&gt; where buyers and sellers bargain with each other, and with other buyers and sellers, to get the "best deal" for themselves, although they have to cooperate to get it (they must give something to receive something). Supposedly this is a "[[level playing field]]" but in reality it is not, simply because some command vastly greater resources than others. The attempt is made to "personalize" otherwise impersonal or anonymous market relationships expressed by transactions.
* the ''combination'' of relations of production and exchange, in which competitors have an interest in hiding certain information, while presenting themselves outwardly in the most advantageous way. Specifically, people are placed in the position where they ''both'' have to compete and to cooperate with each other ''at the same time'', at a very advanced (or at least civilized) level, and to reconcile this predicament involves them in masking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leo Löwenthal]], ''Literature and the Image of Man. Sociological Studies of the European Drama and Novel, 1600–1900''. Boston: Beacon Press, 1957, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement exists in all kinds of types of society, but in bourgeois society it takes specific forms, reflecting the element of ''financial gain'' which is involved in the way people are relating or are related.

==="Naked self-interest"===
In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Marx &amp; Engels had stated that:

{{Quotation|The [[bourgeoisie]]...has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his "natural superiors", and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous "cash payment".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx &amp; Friedrich Engels, ''The Communist Manifesto'', part 1, in: ''Marx/Engels Selected Works'', Vol. 1. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This "naked self-interest" seems to contradict the idea of "masking" in bourgeois society. Supposedly market trade creates transparency and an "open society" of free citizens. In reality, Marx and Engels claim, it does not.&lt;ref&gt;For a commentary, see: [[Elmar Altvater]] &amp; Birgit Mahnkopf, "The world market unbound." In: ''Review of International Political Economy'', Volume 4, Issue 3, September 1997, pp. 448–471.&lt;/ref&gt; The "nakedness" may not reveal very much other than the requirements of trade; it is just that the cultural patterns of what is hidden and what is revealed differ from feudal and ancient society. According to Marx, the labour market appears as the "very Eden of the innate rights of man",&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', Penguin ed., p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; insofar workers can choose to sell their labour-power freely, but in reality, workers are ''forced'' to do so, often on terms unfavourable to them, to survive. As soon as they are inside the factory or office, they have to follow orders and submit to the authority of the employer.

Even in "naked commerce", the possible methods of "masking" what one is, what one represents or what one does, are extremely diverse. Human languages and numerical systems, for example, offer very subtle distinctions of meaning that can "cover up" something, or present it as different from what it really is. Anthropologists, sociologists and linguists have sometimes studied "linguistic masking".&lt;ref&gt;See for example Franklin C. Southworth, "Linguistic masks for power: some relationships between semantic and social change", ''Anthropological Linguistics'', Vol. 16, 1974, pp. 177–19 and R.D.V. Glasgow, ''Madness, Masks and Laughter: An Essay on Comedy''. Cranbury, New Jersey: Associated University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "masking" of quantitative relationships takes three main forms:

*masking plain computational error;
*masking through a [[categorization]] of counting units which hides the real situation, or presents it in a certain light;
*masking through the ("meta-theoretical") interpretation of the overall significance of a quantitative result.

Data may be accepted as a valid result, but dismissed as irrelevant or unimportant in a given context, and therefore not worth paying attention to; or conversely, the importance of specific data may be highlighted as being more important than other related facts.

==Sources of the concept==

===Marx's studies of Greek philosophy===
The theatrical mask, expressing an acting role, was supposedly first invented in the West by the Greek actor [[Thespis]] of [[Attica]] (6th century BC)&lt;ref&gt;"Western Theatre", article in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Greek [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosopher [[Theophrastus]] (circa 371–287 BC) is credited with being the first in the West to define human character in terms of a [[Personality type|typology]] of personal strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]], "Charaktermaske", in: [[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]] (ed.), ''Historisch-kritisches Wörterbuch des Marxismus'', Vol. 2. Hamburg: Das Argument, 1995, p. 438. Haug cites P. Steinmetz, "Afterword", in: Theophrast, ''Charactere''. Stuttgart, 1970, and G. Wilpert, ''Sachwortenbuch der Literatur'', Stuttgart 1989. An English text is available online.[http://www.eudaemonist.com/biblion/characters Eudaemonist.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Marx's idea of character masks appears to have originated in his doctoral studies of [[Greek philosophy]] in 1837–39. At that time, the theatre was one of the few places in Germany where opinions about public affairs could be fairly freely aired, if only in fictionalized form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Tucker]], ed., ''The Marx-Engels Reader''. Norton 2nd ed., 1978) [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1839/notebook/ch06.htm Marxists.org].

Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2010, which discusses various interpretations. The general intellectual milieu in which Marx developed his ideas is covered in: Warren Breckman, ''Marx, the young Hegelians and the origins of radical social theory: Dethroning the Self ''. Cambridge University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently from Marx, the romantic novelist [[Jean Paul]] also used the concept, in portraying the human problems of [[individuation]].&lt;ref&gt;Commentary in: Jochen Hörisch, "Charaktermasken. Subjektivität und Trauma bei Jean Paul und Marx." In: ''Jahrbuch der Jean-Paul-Gesellschaft'', Nr. 14, 1979, republished in Jochen Hörisch, ''Die andere Goethezeit: Poetische Mobilmachung des Subjekts um 1800''. München: Fink, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jean Paul's aesthetics, the ''Charaktermaske'' is the observable face or appearance-form of a hidden self.&lt;ref&gt;See Jean Paul, ''Vorschule der Ästhetik'', in Jean Paul, ''Werke'' (ed. Nortbert Miller), Volume 5. München: Carl Hanser Verlag, 1963, para. 56, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; It is Jean Paul's definition which is cited in the ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'' compiled by [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]] from 1838 onward.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]''.[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB/?lemid=GC00146 Woerterbuchnetz.de Woefterbuchnetz.de].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early literary uses of the German term ''charaktermaske'' are found in [[Joseph von Eichendorff]]'s 1815 novel ''Ahnung und Gegenwart'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph von Eichendorff]], ''Sämtliche Erzählungen, Vol. 1: Ahnung und Gegenwart''. Berlin: Deutscher Klassikerverlag, 2007, chapter 11. [http://www.cluberzengel.de/download/ebooks/pdf/Eichendorff,%20Joseph%20von%20-%20Ahnung%20und%20Gegenwart.pdf Cluberzengel.de]&lt;/ref&gt; a veiled attack against Napoleon, and some years later, in writings by [[Heinrich Heine]]. Heine was among the first to use the theatrical term "Charaktermaske" to describe a social setting.&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Cook, ''A companion to the works of Heinrich Heine''. Rochester, NY: Camden House, 2002, p.63. See e.g. [[Heinrich Heine]], "Zweiter Brief" aus Berlin (1822), in: ''Werke und Briefe in zehn Bänden''. Berlin und Weimar, 1972, Vol. 3, pp. 510-536 [http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Heine,+Heinrich/Reisebilder+und+Reisebriefe/Briefe+aus+Berlin.+1822/Zweiter+Brief Zeno.org]; Heinrich Heine, ''Sämtliche Schriften'' (ed. Klaus Briegleb), München: Hanser Verlag, 1963, Vol. 1, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the concept was also inspired by [[Hegel]]'s discussion of masks in his ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In the section of the ''Phenomenology'' on "the spiritual work of art", paragraphs 742–744.[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ph/phc3bc.htm Marxists.org] In a complex 1844 argument where Marx criticizes Hegel's ''Phenomenology'', the suggestion is that contradictions of object and subject arise because philosophical thought ''masks important aspects of the issue to itself'' (see Marx, ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'', Third Manuscript: "Private Property and Labour" [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/epm/3rd.htm Marxists.org]. For a commentary on Hegels' masks in the ''Phenomenology'', see e.g. [[Robert Bernasconi]], "Persons and masks: The phenomenology of the spirit and its laws", in: [[Drucilla Cornell]] et al. (eds.), ''Hegel and Legal Theory''. New York: Routledge, 1991, pp 78–94.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Aesthetics'', Hegel contrasts the fixed, abstract and universal character masks of the ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'' with the romantic depiction of "character" as a living, subjective individuality embodied in the whole person.&lt;ref&gt;G.W.F. Hegel, ''Aesthetics. Lectures on Fine Art'' (transl. T.M. Knox), Vol. 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975), part 2, chapter 3 "the romantic form of art", p. 576-577.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, the German theatre critic [[Heinrich Theodor Rötscher]] explicitly defined a "character mask" as a ''theatrical role'', acted out in such a way that it expresses all aspects of the assumed personality, his/her social station and background; successfully done, the audience would be able to recognize this personality on first impression.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Theodor Rötscher, ''Die Kunst der Dramatischen Darstellung. In ihrem organische Zusammenhang entwickelt.'' Berlin: Verlag von W. Thome, 1841, p. 355. Cf. Münz, ''op. cit.'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre and drama===
The shift in Marx's use of the concept, from [[dramaturgy]] and [[philosophy]] to political and economic actors, was probably influenced by his well-known appreciation of drama and literature.&lt;ref&gt;See further Rudolf Münz, "Charaktermaske und Theatergleichnis bei Marx". In: R. Münz (ed.), ''Das 'andere' Theater. Studien über ein deutschsprachiges teatro dell'arte der Lessingzeit''. Berlin: Henschelverlag Kunst und gesellschaft, 1979, pp. 19–48. On Marx's literary interests, see: [[Siegbert Salomon Prawer]], ''Marx and World Literature''. Oxford University Press, 1978 and [[Paul Lafargue]], "Reminiscences of Marx", September 1890. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lafargue/1890/xx/marx.htm Marxists.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, European writers and thinkers in the 17th and 18th centuries (the era of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]) were very preoccupied with human character and characterology, many different typologies being proposed; human character was increasingly being defined in a [[secular]] way, independent of [[virtues]] and [[vices]] defined by religion.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Mary Alice Budge, ''The rhetoric of operation: character masks in the fiction of [[Daniel Defoe]]''. Phd dissertation, State University of New York at Buffalo, 1970, 226 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polemics===
The first known reference by Marx to character masks in a publication appears in an 1846 circular which Marx drafted as an exile in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;"Circular against Kriege", Part 4, April–May 1846, in: ''[[Marx/Engels Collected Works]]'', Vol. 6, p. 35. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1846/05/11.htm Marxists.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs again in his polemic against Karl Heinzen in 1847, called ''Moralizing criticism and critical morality''&lt;ref&gt;October 31, 1847, in: ''[[Marx/Engels Collected Works]]'', Vol. 6, p. 312. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/10/31.htm Marxists.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and in part 5 of a satirical piece written in 1852 called ''Heroes of the Exile''.&lt;ref&gt;''Marx/Engels Collected Works'', Vol. 11, p. 657, note 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 18th Brumaire===
In chapter 4 of ''[[The 18th Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'' (1852), a story about the sovereign's dissolution of the French legislative assembly in 1851 in order to reign as imperial dictator, Marx describes how Napoleon abandoned one character mask for another, after dismissing the Barrot-Falloux Ministry in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;''The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte'', first published in ''Die Revolution'' (New York), 1852, chapter 4. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch04.htm Marxists.org].&lt;/ref&gt; In this story, character masks figure very prominently. Contrary to Hegel's belief that states, nations, and individuals are all the time the unconscious tools of the world spirit at work within them,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.htm#PR345 G.W.F. Hegel, ''The philosophy of right'', § 344].&lt;/ref&gt; Marx insists that:

{{Quotation|The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living. And just as they seem to be occupied with revolutionizing themselves and things, creating something that did not exist before, precisely in such epochs of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes in order to present this new scene in world history in time-honored disguise and borrowed language. Thus Luther put on the mask of the [[Apostle Paul]], the Revolution of 1789–1814 draped itself alternately in the guise of the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]], and the [[Revolution of 1848]] knew nothing better to do than to parody, now 1789, now the revolutionary tradition of 1793–95.&lt;ref&gt;''The 18th Brumaire'', Part 1. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm Marxists.org] For a commentary, see: Michel Chaouli, "Masking and Unmasking: The Ideological Fantasies of the Eighteenth Brumaire". In: ''Qui Parle'', Vol. 3, No. 1, Spring 1989, pp. 53–71; Bob Jessop, "The Political Scene and the Politics of Representation: Periodizing Class Struggle and the State in The Eighteenth Brumaire." Working Paper, Department of Sociology, Lancaster University, 2003. [http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/sociology/papers/jessop-political-scene.pdf Lancs.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

===Alfred Meissner===
In 1861–63, the Austrian writer [[Alfred Meissner]], the "king of the poets" criticized by Engels in his 1847 essay ''The True Socialists'',&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Engels, "The true socialists", ''Marx/Engels Collected Works'', Vol. 5, p. 540.[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/true-socialists/index.htm Marxists.org]&lt;/ref&gt; published three volumes of novels under the title ''Charaktermasken''.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Meissner, ''Charaktermasken'' (3 vols.). Leipzig: Grunow Verlag, 1861–63 (Republished in 2011 by Nabu Press, a publisher without an address).&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether Marx was aware of this, but according to Jochen Hörisch it gave the term "character mask" a certain popularity among German speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen Hörisch, "Schlemihls Schatten – Schatten Nietzsches. Eine romantische Apologie des Sekundären", Athenäum 5: Jahrbuch für Romantik 1995, pp. 11–41 at p. 40., revised version in Jochen Hörisch, ''Kopf oder Zahl – Die Poesie des Geldes''. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp 1998. [http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/hostings/athenaeum/documents/athenaeum/1995-5/hoerisch-jochen-11/PDF/hoerisch.pdf Edoc.hu-berlin.de].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abandoning the concept==
Character masks are mentioned five times in ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', and once in ''[[Capital, Volume II]]''. Here, the reference is specifically to ''economic'' character masks, not political character masks. However, both the official Moscow translation of ''Capital, Volume I'' into English, as well as the revised 1976 Penguin translation of ''Capital, Volume I'' into English by Ben Fowkes, deleted all reference to character masks, substituting a non-literal translation.&lt;ref&gt;The academic interpretation of Marx's text in the English-speaking world was for many years influenced by the anti-humanist Marxist [[Louis Althusser]], who believed human beings are only the bearers (receptacles) of a structured totality of social relations. The translator Ben Fowkes states that "The concept of an object (or person) as the receptacle, repository, bearer of some thing or tendency quite different from it appears repeatedly in Capital, and I have tried to translate it uniformly as 'bearer'." (''Capital, Volume I'', 1976 Penguin edition, p. 179). See also Perelman, ''Marx's crises theory: scarcity, labor and finance''. New York: Praeger Publishers, 1987, p. 95)&lt;/ref&gt; English translators of other writings by Marx &amp; Engels, or of classical Marxist texts, quite often deleted ''Charaktermaske'' as well, and often substituted other words such as "mask", "role", "appearance", "puppet", "guise" and "persona".

Marx's concept of character masks has therefore been little known in the English-speaking world, except through the translated writings of the [[Frankfurt School]] and other (mainly German or Austrian) Marxists using the term. [[Tom Bottomore]]'s sociological dictionary of Marxist thought has no entry for the important concept of character masks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Bottomore]] et al. (ed.), ''A dictionary of Marxist Thought'', Basil Blackwell 1983 (rev. edition 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Penguin Dictionary of Critical Theory'' likewise does not refer to it.&lt;ref&gt;See [[David Macey]], ''The Penguin Dictionary of Critical Theory''. Penguin Books, 2000. The ''Cambridge Companion to Critical Theory'' does refer in passing to character masks, with reference to [[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]. See Fred Rush (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Critical Theory''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; David Harvey, the world-famous [[New Left]] popularizer of Marx's writings, does not mention the concept at all in works such as his ''The Limits to Capital''. Likewise [[Fredric Jameson]], the famous commentator on post modernity, offers no analysis of the concept. There is no entry for the concept in James Russell's ''Marx-Engels Dictionary'',&lt;ref&gt;James Russell, ''Marx-Engels Dictionary''. Brighton: Harvester 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; in Terrell Carver's ''A Marx Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;Terrell Carver, ''A Marx Dictionary''. Cambridge: Polity Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the ''Historical Dictionary of Marxism''.&lt;ref&gt;David Walker &amp; Daniel Gray, ''Historical Dictionary of Marxism''. Lanham, Maryland: The Scarecrow Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jochen Hörisch claims that "despite its systematic importance, the concept of character masks was conspicuously taboo in the dogmatic interpretation of Marx".&lt;ref&gt;Jochen Hörisch, "Larven und Charaktermaske – zum elften Kapitel von ''Ahnung und Gegenwart''", in: Jochen Hörisch,''Die andere Goethezeit: Poetische Mobilmachung des Subjekts um 1800''. München: Fink, 1998, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Dieter Claessens]] mentions the concept in his 1992 ''Lexikon'',&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Claessens/Karin Claessens, ''Gesellschaft. Lexikon der Grundbegriffe.'' Reinbek: Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag GmbH, 1992, p. 44. Compare also ''Wissenschaftslexikon'' [http://www.wirtschaftslexikon24.net/e/charaktermaske/charaktermaske.htm Wirtschaftslexikon24.net].&lt;/ref&gt; there is another mention in ''Lexikon zur Soziologie''&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Rülcker &amp; Otthein Rammstedt, "Charaktermaske". In: Werner Fuchs-Heinritz, Daniela Klimke, Rüdiger Lautmann, Otthein Rammstedt, Urs Stäheli &amp; Christoph Weischer, ''Lexikon zur Soziologie'' (4th edition). Wiesbaden: Vs Verlag, 2007, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; and the more recent German-language ''Historical-Critical Dictionary of Marxism'' has a substantive entry for character masks by [[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]].&lt;ref&gt;Haug, "Charaktermaske". See also [[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]], "Charaktermaske". In: Martin Papenbrock, ''Kunst und Sozialgeschichte: Festchrift für Jutta Held''. Pfaffenweiler: Centaurus, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Haug suggests that the conjunction of "character" and "mask" is "specifically German", since in the French, English, Spanish, and Italian editions of ''Capital, Volume I'', the term "mask", "bearer" or "role" is used, but not "character mask".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]], "Charaktermaske", p. 436-437.&lt;/ref&gt; But since "character mask" is a technical term in theatre and costume hire – referring both to physical masks expressing specific characters (for example, [[Halloween]] masks), and to theatrical roles – it is not "specifically German", and most existing translations are simply inaccurate. However, Haug is correct insofar as "character mask" as a sociological or psychological term is rarely used by non-German speakers.&lt;ref&gt;There is no entry for the term "character mask" in the Oxford English Dictionary. However, it is a specialist term in acting theory: see Ozdemir Nutku, "Style in acting" (Ankara: Teyatro Keyfi, 2002) {{cite web|url=http://www.tiyatrokeyfi.com/gorusler/styleinacting.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717062904/http://www.tiyatrokeyfi.com/gorusler/styleinacting.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marx's argument in ''Das Kapital''==

Marx's argument about character masks in capitalism can be summarized&lt;ref&gt;Michael Heinrich, "Replik auf Martin Birkner 'Der schmale Grat'", in: ''grundrisse. Zeitschrift fur linke theorie und debatte'', no. 1, 2002.
 [http://www.grundrisse.net/grundrisse03/3heinrich.htm Grundrisse.net]. Eduard Urbánek, "Roles, Masks and Characters: a Contribution to Marx's Idea of the Social Role", ''Social Research'', Vol. 34, No. 3, 1967, pp. 529–563. Reprinted in Peter L. Berger (ed.), ''Marxism and Sociology: Views from Eastern Europe''. New York: Meredith Corporation/Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1969. As cited in the latter, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; in six steps.

===Roles===
The first step in his argument is that when people engage in trade, run a business or work in a job, they adopt and personify (personally represent) a certain function, role or behaviour pattern which is required of them to serve their obligations; their consent to the applicable rules is assumed, as a necessity to succeed in the activities. They have to act this way, because of the co-operative relationships they necessarily have to work with in the [[division of labour]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Karl Marx]], ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', chapter 24, part 4. Compare Ilja Srubar, ''Phänomenologie und soziologische Theorie: Aufsätze zur pragmatischen Lebenswelttheorie''. Wiesbaden: Vs Verlag, 2007, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; People have to conform to them, whether they like it or not. If they take on a role, they have to fulfill the packet of tasks which is part of the job.

People are initially born into a world in which these social relationships already exist, and "[[socialized]]" into them in the process of becoming "well-adjusted adults" – to the point where they internalize their meaning, and accept them as a natural reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx]], ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', Penguin edition, p. 899. See further on this topic, in an American context, e.g. [[Samuel Bowles (economist)]] and [[Herbert Gintis]], ''Schooling in Capitalist America''. Routledge, 1976 and research by Melvin Kohn. For an English study, see the classic work by [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], ''Learning to Labour: how working class kids get working class jobs''. Aldershot: Gower, 1977.
 [http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/VOLUME05/Paul_WillisUK.shtml Icce.rug.nl]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, they can learn to act spontaneously and automatically in a way consistent with these social relations, even if that is sometimes a problematic process.

===Interests===
The second step in his argument is that in acting according to an economic function, employees serve the impersonal (business, legal or political) interests of an abstract [[authority]], which may have little or nothing to do with their own personal interests.&lt;ref&gt;''Marx/Engels Werke'', Band 18. Berlin: Dietz, 1962, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; They have to keep the two kinds of interests separated, and "manage them" appropriately in a "mature, professional" way.&lt;ref&gt;See Ottomeyer, ''Ökonomische Zwänge und menschliche Beziehungen: Soziales Verhalten im Kapitalismus''. Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag, 1977, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, they "personify" or "represent" interests, and who they personally are, may well be completely irrelevant to that – it is relevant only to the extent that their true personality fits with the role.

People are slotted into functions insofar as they have characteristics which are at least compatible with the functions. They always have a choice in how they perform their role and how they act it out, but they have no choice about taking it on. If they succeed in their role, they can advance their position or career, but if they fail to live up to it, they are demoted or fired. Human individuality is then conceptualized in terms of the relationship between buyer and seller.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'', chapter 2 
 [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/ch02_2.htm Marxists.org]. Compare [[János Kornai]], ''The socialist system: the political economy of communism''. Princeton University Press, 1992, p. 251. The character masks of buyers and sellers are analyzed in [[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]], ''Kritik der Warenästhetik: Gefolgt von Warenästhetik im High-Tech-Kapitalismus''. Suhrkamp Verlag, neuausgabe 2009, pp. 89–98. English edition: Wolfgang Fritz Haug, ''Critique of commodity aesthetics''. Cambridge: Polity Press, 1986, pp. 49f.[http://www.wolfgangfritzhaug.inkrit.de/documents/haughall.pdf Wolfgangfritzhaug.inkrit.de] [http://www.wolfgangfritzhaug.inkrit.de/documents/NewElementsCommodityAesthetics.pdf Wolfgangfritzhaug.inkrit.de] See also [[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]], "Das Verkaufsgespräch. Charaktermaske von Käufer und Verkäufer". In: Joachim Dyck (ed.), ''Rhetorik in der Schule''. Kronberg: Scriptor Verlag, 1974, pp. 196–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masking===
The third step in his argument is, that the practices just described necessarily lead to the "masking" of [[behavior]]s and [[personalities]], and to a transformation of personality and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;For a commentary, see e.g. [[Lawrence Krader]], "Dialectic of Anthropology" in: Lawrence Krader, ''Dialectic of Civil Society''. Amsterdam: Van Gorcum, Assen, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not just that people can rarely be "all of themselves" while performing a specialized function in the [[division of labour]], and must also express something new and different. There are also many competing, conflicting and contradictory interests at stake – and these must somehow be dealt with and reconciled by the living person.&lt;ref&gt;See further Michael Eldred, [http://www.arte-fact.org/ccfbdspf.html ''Critique of Competitive Freedom and the Bourgeois-Democratic State: Outline of a Form-analytic Extension of Marx's Uncompleted System'']. With an Appendix 'Value-form Analytic Reconstruction of the Capital-Analysis' by Michael Eldred, Marnie Hanlon, Lucia Kleiber and Mike Roth, Kurasje, Copenhagen, 1984. Amended, digitized edition 2010 with a new Preface, lxxiii + 466 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different interests have to be constantly mediated and defended in everyday behaviour, with the aid of character masks; these masks exist to mediate conflict. It means that people are obliged or forced to express certain qualities and repress other qualities in themselves. In doing this, however, their own consciousness and personality is altered.&lt;ref&gt;''Marx/Engels Werke'' (Berlin), Vol. 15, p. 464. As cited by Urbanek, p. 200. [[Russell Jacoby]], ''[[Social amnesia]]'' (1975). Transaction publishers, 1997, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; To be part of an organization, or "rise to the top" of an organization, they have to be able to "act out" everything that it requires in a convincing way, and that can only happen if they either have, or acquire, real characteristics which are at least compatible with it. That requires not just an "acculturation" process, but also sufficient behavioral flexibility, [[intelligence]], acumen and [[creativity]] – so that a person does not inappropriately "fall out of the role". Discord between identity and function is tolerated only in contexts where it does not matter.

===Inversion===
The fourth step in his argument concerns an inversion of [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Entity|object]]. It is not just that the commercial relationships between things being traded begins to dominate and reshape human behaviour, and remake social relations. In addition, human relations become the property of things. Inanimate things, and the relationships between them, are endowed with human characteristics. They become "actors" relating in their own right to which people much adjust their behaviour, and they are also theorized in that way.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Karl Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume III]]'', chapter 48: "The Trinity Formula" (Penguin, 1981, p. 953).&lt;/ref&gt; This is a special case of [[anthropomorphism]] because it occurs ''within'' human relations, not in relation to an object external to them.

A symbolic language and way of communicating emerges, in which inanimate "things" are personified. A market (or a price, or a stock, or a state etc.) gains an independent power to act. Marx calls this [[commodity fetishism]] (or more generally, "fetishism"), and he regards it as a necessary [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] of the symbolizations required to traverse life's situations in bourgeois society, because the relationships between people are constantly being mediated by the relationships between things. It means that people are eventually unable to take their mask off, because the masks are controlled by the business relationships between things being traded, and by broader legal, class, or political interests. If they are actually unable to take the mask off, they have effectively submitted fully to the power of abstract, impersonal [[market forces]] and legal rules.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Krader, "Marxist anthropology: principles and contradictions." ''International Review of Social History'', Volume XX 1975, pp. 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt; As many philosophical texts suggest, by being habituated to a role, the role is internalized by individuals, and becomes part of their personality: they become the thing that they acted out.

===Alienation===
The fifth step in the argument is that on the world's stage, the "dance of masked people, and of the things they have endowed with an independent power to act and relate" leads to pervasive human [[Social alienation|alienation]] (the estrangement of people from themselves, and from others in contacts which have become impersonal and functional).&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'', first manuscript, section "Estranged Labour"
 [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/preface.htm Marxists.org]. For a commentary, see e.g. [[Bertell Ollman]], ''Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society''. Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed., 1976&lt;/ref&gt; It durably distorts human consciousness at the very least, and at worst it completely deforms human consciousness. It mystifies the real nature, and the real relationships, among people and things – even to the point where they can hardly be conceived anymore as they really are.

The masks influence the very way in which realities are categorized. People's theorizing about the world also becomes detached from the relevant contexts, and the interpretation of reality then involves multiple "layers" of meanings, in which "part of the story" hides the "whole story". What the whole story is, may itself become an almost impenetrable mystery, about which it may indeed be argued that it cannot be solved.&lt;ref&gt;See further e.g. [[Ernest Mandel]], ''Delightful Murder: A social history of the crime story''. Pluto Press, 1984; Linden Peach, ''Masquerade, crime and fiction''. Houndmills, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006; Ernst Bloch, "A philosophical view of the detective novel (1965)", in: Bloch, ''The utopian function of art and literature: selected essays''. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1988, pp. 252–253.&lt;/ref&gt; The real truth about a person may be considered unknowable, but as long as the person can function normally, it may not matter; one is judged simply according to the function performed.

In what Marx calls "ideological consciousness", interests and realities are presented other than they really are, in justifying and defining the meaning of what happens. People may believe they can no longer solve problems, simply because they lack the categories to "think" them, and it requires a great deal of critical and self-critical thought, as well as [[optimism]], to get beyond the surface of things to the root of the problems.

===Development===
The last step is that effectively capitalist market society develops human beings in an inverted way. The capitalist economy is not primarily organized for the people, but people are organized for the capitalist economy, to serve others who already have plenty of wealth. In an increasingly complex division of labour offering little job security, there is more and more external pressure forcing people to act in all kinds of different roles, masking themselves in the process; by this act, they also acquire more and more behavioural and [[semiotic]] flexibility, and develop more and more relational skills and connections. The necessity to work and relate in order to survive thus accomplishes the "economic formation of society" at the same time, even if in this society people lack much control over the social relations in which they must participate. It is just that the whole development occurs in an imbalanced, unequal and uncoordinated way, in which the development of some becomes conditional on the lack of development by others.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''[[The German Ideology]]'', ed. C.J. Arthur, 1970, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial interests and political class interests ultimately prevail over the expressed interests of individuals. In the periodic economic crises, masses of people are condemned to the [[unemployment]] scrapheap, no matter what skills they may have; they are incompatible with the functioning of the bourgeois system, "collateral rubbish" that is swept aside. Even highly developed people can find that society regards them as worthless – which quite often tends to radicalize their opinions (see [[extremism]] and [[radicalization]]).

===Revolution===
A seventh step could in principle be added, namely a big crisis in society which sparks off a revolution and overturns the existing capitalist system. In that case, it could be argued, the false masks are torn off, and people have to stand up for what they really are, and what they really believe in.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheila Fitzpatrick]], ''Tear Off the Masks!: Identity and Imposture in Twentieth-Century Russia''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; But that is a possibility which Marx did not comprehensively theorize in ''[[Das Kapital]]''.

The "mask metaphor" also appears already in the early writings of [[Friedrich Engels]], and his influence on Marx is often underestimated.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, "Modern literary life", ''Mitternachtzeitung für Leser'', No. 51-54, March 1840, and No. 83-87, May 1840. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1840/03/literary.htm Marxists.org].
Also "Marginalia to Texts of our Time", in: Rheinische Zeitung No. 145, May 25, 1842. ''[[Marx/Engels Collected Works]]'', Volume 2. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/05/25.htm Marxists.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Engels referred to character masks in his ''Preface'' to ''[[Capital, Volume III]]'' – when rebutting a criticism of Marx's theory by [[Achille Loria]]. Engels's substantive [[sociological]] suggestion seems to be that:

*in a society's progressive, constructive era, its best characters come to the fore, and no character masks are necessary for them.
*when society degenerates and submits to intolerable conditions, it not only gives rise to all sorts of dubious, talentless characters who cannot lead the way forward, but also society's [[dignity]] can only be sustained by masking the social contradictions.
*based on comprehensive knowledge of a country and its [[national psychology]], it is possible to specify the types of personalities who exemplify the nature of the era.

The problem with this kind of argument is just that, in defining the meaning of what is happening in society, it is very difficult to provide definite scientific proof that this meaning is the objective truth. It remains an interpretation, which may make sense of things at a certain level, without providing the whole truth. Engels's comment illustrates that the concept of character masks is not infrequently used in a [[polemical]] way to describe a false or inauthentic representation.&lt;ref&gt;For a polemical use of the concept of character masks, see: ''[http://www.gegenstandpunkt.com/msz/html/82/82_1/bendit.htm Daniel Cohn-Bendit. Sponti als Charaktermaske]''. ''Marxistische Streit- und Zeitschrift'', issue 1, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Engels, like Marx, also used the notion of a "mask" in the more general sense of a political "guise" or "disguise", for example in several of his historical analyses about religious movements.&lt;ref&gt;Engels, ''Revolution and Counterrevolution in Germany'' (1851), chapter 3, translation corrected according to the German original.[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/germany/ch03.htm Marxists.org]; [http://atheism.about.com/library/marxism/bl_EngelsEarlyChrist.htm Engels, ''On the history of early Christianity'' (1894–95)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxist theories==

===Early Marxism===
*In his biography of Marx, [[Franz Mehring]] refers to character masks, but more in the sense of Weberian [[ideal type]]s or stereotypical characters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Mehring]], ''[[Karl Marx]]: The Story of his Life.'' London: Routledge 1936, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''Marx-Studien'' published by [[Rudolf Hilferding]] and [[Max Adler (Marxist)|Max Adler]] referred to character masks as a theoretical category.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Karner [=pseud. of [[Karl Renner]] ], "Die Soziale Funktion der Rechts-Institute", in: Rudolf Hilferding and Max Adler (eds.), ''Marx-Studien: Blätter zur Theorie und Politik des wissenschaftlichen Sozialismus'', Band 1. Vienna: Brand/Wiener Volksbuchhandlung, 1904, pp. 95, 98, 109, 119, 181 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The communist dramatist [[Bertolt Brecht]] made extensive use of neutral and character masks. In plays such as ''The Caucasian Chalk Circle'' and ''The Good Person of Szechwan'', the masks support what Brecht called "the alienation effect" (see [[distancing effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;The modalities of distancing are explored in: Helmut Lethen, ''[http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=kt4m3nc7mf;chunk.id=0;doc.view=print Cool Conduct: The Culture of Distance in Weimar Germany]''. Robert Boyers, ''The Legacy of the German refugee intellectuals.'' Schocken Books, 1972, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lukács===
[[György Lukács]] referred to the "very important category of economic character masks", but he never provided a substantive analysis of its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[[György Lukács]], ''History and class consciousness''. London: Merlin, 1971, p. 81, note 11; Patrick Eiden-Offe, "Typing Class: Classification and redemption in Lukács's political and literary theory." In: Timothy Bewes and Timothy Hall, ''Georg Lukács: the fundamental dissonance of existence: aesthetics, politics, literature.'' London: Continuum, 2011, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; He only referred candidly to his own "Socratic mask" in a 1909 love letter to a friend.&lt;ref&gt;György Lukács, "My Socratic Mask. Letter to Charlotte Fereczi, January 1909". In: Arpad Kadarkay, ''The Lukács Reader''. Oxford: Blackwell, 1995. pp. 57–62.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1909 essay, Lukács opined that "the bourgeois way of life" is "only a mask", which "like all masks" ''negates'' something, i.e. the bourgeois mask denies vital parts of human life, in the interests of money-making.&lt;ref&gt;[[György Lukács]], ''Soul and form''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1974, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lukács restricted the application of the idea to [[capitalists]] only, claiming that Marx had considered capitalists as "mere character masks"&lt;ref&gt;Lukács, "Reification and the consciousness of the proletariat", section II, in ''History and class consciousness''.&lt;/ref&gt; – meaning that capitalists, as the personifications ("agents") of capital, did not do anything "without making a business out of it", given that their activity consisted of the correct management and calculation of the objective effects of economic laws. Marx himself never simply equated capitalists with their character masks; they were human beings entangled in a certain life predicament, like anybody else.&lt;ref&gt;See also: Barbara Roos and J.P. Roos, "The upper-class way of life: an alternative for what?". United Nations University Working Paper HSDRGPID-68/UNUP-452, 1983.{{cite web|url=http://www.transcend-nordic.org/doc/10%20GPID-UNU%20Working%20Papers/HSDR-GPID68.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720091346/http://www.transcend-nordic.org/doc/10%20GPID-UNU%20Working%20Papers/HSDR-GPID68.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }} Cf. Helmut Dahmer, ''Libido und Gesellschaft'', 2nd edition. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1982, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; Capitalists became the "personification" of their capital, because they had money which was permanently invested somewhere, and which necessarily had to obtain a certain yield. At most one could say that capitalists had more to hide, and that some had personal qualities enabling them to succeed in their function, while others lacked the personal prerequisites. According to Lukács, the character masks of the [[bourgeoisie]] express a "necessary false consciousness" about the [[class consciousness]] of the [[proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;Haug, "Charaktermaske", p. 446-447. Haug borrows this insight about Lukács from Matzner. See: Jutta Matzner, "Der Begriff der Charaktermaske bei Karl Marx". In: ''Soziale Welt. Zeitschrift für sozialwissenschaftliche Forschung und Praxis'', Vol. 15, issue 2, 1964, p. 134. See: Christoph Henning, "Charaktermaske und Individualität bei Marx", in: ''Marx-Engels Jahrbuch 2009''. Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war Western Marxism===
In the post-war tradition of [[Western Marxism]], the concept of character masks was theorized about especially by scholars of the [[Frankfurt School]],&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [[Paul Connerton]], ''The tragedy of enlightenment: an essay on the Frankfurt School''. Cambridge University Press, 1980, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and other Marxists influenced by this school. Most of the Frankfurt theorists believed in Freud's basic model of human nature. [[Erich Fromm]] expanded it by developing the social-psychological concept of "[[social character]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Fromm]], ''Escape from freedom.'' New York: Avon books, 1965, p. 304-305.&lt;/ref&gt;
*It also appears in Marxist-existentialist thought, such as in the writings of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref&gt;Casimir R. Bukala, "Sartre's Phenomenology Of The Mask." In: ''Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology'', Vol. 7, October 1976, pp. 198–203. William Keith Tims, ''Masks and Sartre's Imaginary''.&lt;/ref&gt; In his famous book ''[[Being and Time]]'', Heidegger distinguished between the "they-self", i.e. the self that is just "being there", in common view, and the ''authentic self'', the "self-aware" self who explicitly grasps his own identity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Heidegger]], ''[[Being and Time]]''. New York: State University of New York Press, 1996, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a radical synthesis of Marx and Freud, [[Wilhelm Reich]] created the concept of "character armor". It refers to the total "harness" of physiological defences which mask off the pain of repressing feelings – feelings which the individual is not permitted to express in civil life, or is unable to express adequately.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Reich]], ''Character Analysis''. New York: Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux, 1949. Cf. Helmut Dahmer, ''Libido und Gesellschaft'', 2nd edition. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1982, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Masking is nowadays acknowledged by behavioural scientists to be also a purely biological or psychophysical process in sentient organisms: neurologically, the subjective experience of some perceived stimuli by the organism is modified or distorted by the intervention of ''other'' perceived stimuli. It can have a critically important effect on the ability of the organism to make choices, orient itself, or display sensitivity. Reich's idea was developed further by [[Arthur Janov]], where the [[primal scream]] breaks through the masks of the body and its behaviour.
*In the philosophy of the Marxist semiotician [[Roland Barthes]], the mask features primarily as a "sign" with fixed meanings.&lt;ref&gt;David Wiles, ''Mask and Performance in Greek Tragedy: From Ancient Festival to Modern Experimentation''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, pp. 116–124.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The concept of character masks was used by Anglo-Saxon Western Marxist or post-Marxist thinkers like [[Perry Anderson]], Werner Bonefeld, [[Paul Connerton]], Michael Eldred, [[Russell Jacoby]], [[Lawrence Krader]], and [[Michael Perelman]]. [[János Kornai]] also refers to it. In Germany and Austria, the concept has been used in the Marxian tradition by [[Elmar Altvater]], Ingo Elbe, [[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]], Michael Heinrich, Robert Kurz, Ernst Lohoff, Klaus Ottomeyer, and Franz Schandl (as cited in the notes).

===Theodor Adorno===
Adorno argues that Marx explained convincingly ''why'' the appearance-form and the real nature of human relations often does not directly coincide, not on the strength of a metaphysical ''philosophy'' such as [[transcendental realism]],&lt;ref&gt;On transcendental realism, see: [[Roy Bhaskar]], ''A realist theory of science'' (2nd ed.). Hassocks, Sussex: Harvester Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; but by inferring the social meaning of human relations from the way they observably appear in practical life – using systematic critical and [[logic]]al thought as a tool of discovery. Every step in the analysis can be logically and empirically tested.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Herbert Marcuse: "The transcendence leading from facts to essence is historical. Through it, given facts are understood as appearances whose essence can be comprehended only in the context of particular historical tendencies aiming at a different form of reality". ''Negations. Essays in Critical Theory''. London: MayFlyBooks, 2009, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The hermeneutic assumption is that these relations require ''shared meanings'' in order to be able to function and communicate at all. These shared presuppositions have an intrinsic [[rationality]], because human behaviour – ultimately driven by the need to survive – is to a large extent [[purposive]] ([[teleological]]), and not arbitrary or random (though some of it may be). If the "essential relationships" never became visible or manifest in any way, no science would be possible at all, only speculative metaphysics. It is merely that sense data require correct interpretation – they do not have a meaning independently of their socially mediated interpretation. In that sense, the mask presupposes the existence of something which for the time being remains invisible, but which can be revealed when one discovers what is behind the mask. It may be that the essence suddenly reveals itself on the stage of history, or more simply that the understandings which one already has, are altered so that the essence of the thing is finally grasped.

===Frankfurt School analysis===
Inspired by Marx's concept of character masks, the founder of the [[Frankfurt School]], [[Max Horkheimer]], began to work out a critical, social-psychological understanding of human character in the so-called ''Dämmerung'' period (in 1931/34).&lt;ref&gt;Gunzelin Schmid Noerr, "Zwischen Sozialpsychologie und Ethik – Erich Fromm und die 'Frankfurt Schule'," in: ''Mitteilungen des Instituts für Sozialforschung'', Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität, Frankfurt, Heft 11. September 2000, pp. 7–40. Cited according to the version in the online Erich Fromm Archive, p. 5. [http://www.erich-fromm.de/biophil/joomla/images/stories/pdf-Dateien/Schmid_Noer_%20G_2000.pdf Erich-fromm.de]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer stated the Frankfurt School perspective clearly:

{{Quotation|The equality of free individuals, which renews itself through the exchange, the labor of each as the basis of their possessions and power, in short, the principle of the bourgeoisie upon which rests its ideology, its justice, and its morality... reveals itself as a mere façade that masks the true relations.&lt;ref&gt;Max Horkheimer, "Montaigne and the Function of Skepticism" (1938). In: Horkheimer, ''Between Philosophy and Social Science : Selected Early Writings Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought''. MIT Press, 1993, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The Frankfurt School, and especially [[Herbert Marcuse]], was also concerned with how people might rebel against or liberate themselves from the character-masks of life in bourgeois society, through asserting themselves authentically as social, political and sexual beings. The Frankfurt School theorists intended to show, that if in bourgeois society things appear other than they really are, this masking is not simply attributable to the disguises of competitive business relationships in the marketplace. It is rooted in the very psychological make-up, formation and behaviour of individual people. In their adaptation to bourgeois society, they argued, people ''internalize'' specific ways of concealing and revealing what they do, repressing some of their impulses and expressing others. If people are dominated, they are not dominated only by forces external to themselves, but by ideas and habits which they have internalized, and accept as being completely "natural". Max Horkheimer puts it as follows: "The principle of domination, based originally on brute force, acquired in the course of time a more spiritual character. The inner voice took the place of the master in issuing commands."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Horkheimer]], "The revolt of nature" (1947). In: Max Horkheimer, ''Eclipse of reason''. New York: Continuum, 2004, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contradictory masks====
The "masking" of an alienated life, and the attempts to counteract it, are thought of in these Marxist theories as co-existing but contradictory processes,&lt;ref&gt;Theodor W. Adorno, ''Negative Dialektik''. In: ''Gesammelte Schriften'' 6, Frankfurt: 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; involving constant conflicts between what people really are, how they present themselves, and what they should be according to some external requirement imposed on them – a conflict which involves a perpetual struggle from which people can rarely totally withdraw, because they still depend for their existence on others, and have to face them, masked or unmasked.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Ute Grabowski, ''Persönlichkeitsentwicklung im Beruf: das Problem des Kompromisses zwischen Persönlichkeit und Charaktermaske''.

&lt;/ref&gt;

====The struggle for identity====
To the extent that the commercial and public roles impose heavy personal burdens, and little space exists anymore "to be oneself", people can experience personal stress, mental suffering and personal estrangement (alienation), sometimes to the point where they "lose themselves", and no longer "know who they are" ([[identity crisis (psychology)|identity crisis]]).&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the writings of [[Erich Fromm]]. The concept of "identity crisis" was originally made popular by the post-Freudian psychologist [[Erik Erikson]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*People may continue to function routinely ("the silent compulsion of economic relations"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', chapter 28, Penguin edition, p. 899.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimating]], suppressing or masking the contradictions, perhaps in a [[schizoid]] way, as a [[zombie]], as a [[psychopath]], or by becoming withdrawn. In that case, Erich Fromm argues, human beings can become wholly conformist "automatons" ("the automation of the individual") in which a "pseudo self" replaces the "original self" – "The pseudo self is only an agent who actually represents the role a person is supposed to play, but who does so under the name of the self."&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Fromm]], ''Escape from freedom'', 2nd edition. New York: Avon Books, 1965, p. 229-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, there exists no individual solution to such identity problems, because to solve them requires the positive recognition, acceptance and affirmation of an [[Identity (social science)|identity]] by others – and this can only happen, if the individual can "join in" and receive social acknowledgement of his identity. Marx himself tackled this problem – rather controversially – in his 1843/44 essay "[[On the Jewish Question]]".

==Criticism and recent controversies==

===Dialectical difficulties===
Much of the scientific controversy about Marx's concept of character masks centres on his unique [[dialectic]]al approach to analyzing the forms and structure of social relations in the capitalist system: in ''[[Das Kapital]]'', he had dealt with persons (or "economic characters") only insofar as they personified or symbolized – often in a [[Reification (Marxism)|reified]] way – economic categories, roles, functions and interests (see above). According to Marx, the capitalist system functioned as a "system", precisely because the bourgeois [[relations of production]] and trade, including property rights, were imposed on people whether they liked it or not. They had to act and conform in a specific way to survive and prosper. As the mass of capital produced grew larger, and markets expanded, these bourgeois relations spontaneously reproduced themselves on a larger and larger scale, be it with the assistance of state aid, regulation or repression.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Capital, Volume I'', chapter 25 and 26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many authors have argued that this approach leaves many facets of capitalist social relations unexplained.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [[Michael Lebowitz]], ''Beyond Capital: Marx's Political Economy of the Working Class'', 2nd edition. Palgrave Macmillan, 2003 and Marcel van der Linden &amp; Karl Heinz Roth (eds.), ''Über Marx hinaus: Arbeitsgeschichte und Arbeitsbegriff in der Konfrontation mit den globalen Arbeitsverhältnissen des 21. Jahrhunderts''. Hamburg: Assoziation A, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it is not so easy to understand the interactions between individuals and the society of which they are part, in such a way, that each is both self-determining and determined by the other.

Marx's concept of character masks has been interrogated by scholars primarily in the German-language literature. [[Werner Sombart]] stated in 1896 (two years after ''[[Capital, Volume III]]'' was published) that "We want a psychological foundation of social events and Marx did not bother about it".&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Sombart]], ''Sozialismus und soziale Bewegung im 19. Jahrhundert''. Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1896, p. 72. As cited by Reiner Grundmann and Nico Stehr, "[https://aston.academia.edu/documents/0094/1423/JClassSoc.pdf Why Is Werner Sombart Not Part of the Core of Classical Sociology?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621000509/http://aston.academia.edu/documents/0094/1423/JClassSoc.pdf |date=June 21, 2010 }}", in: ''Journal of Classical Sociology'', Vol. 1 no. 2 July 2001, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
The historian [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]] has recorded how, in the [[Soviet Union]], "The theatrical metaphor of masks was ubiquitous in the 1920s and '30s, and the same period saw a flowering of that peculiar form of political theater: the [[show trial]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheila Fitzpatrick]], ''Tear Off the Masks!: Identity and Imposture in Twentieth-Century Russia.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who supported the revolution and its communist leadership were politically defined as "proletarian" and those who opposed it were defined as "bourgeois". The enemies of the revolution had to be hunted down, unmasked, and forced to confess their counter-revolutionary (i.e. subversive) behaviour, whether real or imagined. It led to considerable political paranoia. Abandoning bourgeois and primitive norms, and becoming a cultured, socialist citizen, was "akin to learning a role".&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the [[Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]] (RAPP) adopted the slogan "tear off each and every mask from reality". This was based on a quotation from [[Lenin]], who wrote in his 1908 essay on ''Leo Tolstoy as mirror of the Russian revolution'' that the "realism of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] was the tearing off of each and every mask"(''sryvanie vsekh i vsiacheskikh masok'').&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, p. 65 note. See V.I. Lenin, "Leo Tolstoy as mirror of the Russian revolution" (''Proletary'', No. 35, September 11 (24), 1908), in: ''Collected Works'', Vol. 15, Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1977, p. 205. [http://www.marx2mao.com/PDFs/Lenin%20CW-Vol.%2015.pdf Marx2mao.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The communist authorities kept detailed files on the class and political credentials of citizens, leading to what historians call "file-selves".&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, in 1973 (16 years before [[Slavoj Žižek]] entered the intellectual scene) the German [[New Left]] critic Michael Schneider claimed that:

{{Quotation|The animosity towards psychology that marked the [[Stalinist]] era and determines the communist reception of [[Freud]] to this day is based primarily on the Marxist concept of the "character mask". The Leftist 'anti-psychologism' of [[neo-Stalinist]] and [[Maoist]] groups in Germany and elsewhere also seeks to condemn [[psychoanalysis]] time and again with the argument that Marx's concept of the "character mask" has superseded psychology once and for all. Such a vulgar anti-psychologism, however, mistakes the [[polemical]] nature of the concept. Marx used it primarily to attack bourgeois psychologism which sublimated the principle of ''homo homini lupus est'' [i.e. 'man is a wolf to man'] into an eternal verity of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schneider, ''Neurosis and civilization: a Marxist/Freudian synthesis.'' New York: The Seabury Press, 1975, p. 33. Schneider's theory was criticized by Klaus Ottomeyer in ''Anthropologieproblem und Marxistische Handlungstheorie''. Giessen: Focus-Verlag, 1976, pp. 121–173.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

According to this interpretation, there was a "blind spot" in Marx's explanation of bourgeois society, because he had disregarded psychological factors. Moreover, Marxists had interpreted Marx's theory of the "personification of economic functions" as an ''alternative'' to psychology as such. Thus, equipped with a simplistic "reflection theory of consciousness" and an "objectivist concept of class consciousness", the Russian revolutionaries (naively) assumed that once the bourgeois had been liberated from his property, and the institutions of capitalism were destroyed, then there was no more need for masking anything – society would be open, obvious and transparent, and resolving psychological problems would become a purely practical matter (the "[[Engineers of the human soul|re-engineering of the human soul]]"). Very simply put, the idea was that "the solution of psychological problems is communism". However, Raymond A. Bauer suggests that the communist suspicion of psychological research had nothing directly to do with the idea of "character masks" as such, but more with a general rejection of all approaches which were deemed "subjectivist" and "unscientific" in a positivist sense (see [[positivism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Bauer, ''The new man in Soviet psychology''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1952, p. 67, p. 90 and p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The USSR became increasingly interested in conceptions of [[Marx's theory of human nature|human nature]] which facilitated social control by the communist party, and from this point of view, too, the concept of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] was problematic and a nuisance: by definition, the unconscious is something which cannot easily be controlled consciously. However, psychoanalysis was considered bourgeois; this situation began to change only gradually [[Nikita Khrushchev]] had made his famous secret speech, in which he condemned the "personality cult" around Stalin (see "[[On the Personality Cult and Its Consequences]]"). The obligatory official broadsides against Freud and the [[Neo-Freudianism|neo-Freudians]] in the Soviet Union ceased only from 1972, after which psychoanalysis was to a large extent rehabilitated.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''op.cit''., chapter 8, p. 146 ''et seq''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New Left and the Red Army Faction===
The [[New Left]] was a radical trend which began in 1956/57, a time when large numbers of intellectuals around the world resigned from the "Old Left" [[Communist parties]] in protest against the Soviet invasion of Hungary during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. These New Left intellectuals broke with the official [[Marxism–Leninism]] ideology, and they founded new magazines, clubs and groups, which in turn strongly influenced a new generation of students. They began to study Marx afresh, to find out what he had really meant.

In Germany, the term ''Charaktermaske'' was popularized in the late 1960s and in the 1970s especially by "red" [[Rudi Dutschke]], one of the leaders of the student radicals.&lt;ref&gt;"'Charaktermaske' bei Marx Larven der Bürger entlarven." ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 19 July 1995, Nr. 165, p. N6. Also e.g. "Wir fordern die Enteignung Axel Springers. SPIEGEL-Gespräch mit dem Berliner FU-Studenten [[Rudi Dutschke]] (SDS)". In: ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', issue 29, 10 July 1967.
 [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46225038.html Spiegel.de]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=2123 Germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org]&lt;/ref&gt; By "character masks", Dutschke meant essentially that the official political personalities and business leaders were merely the interchangeable "human faces", the representatives or puppets masking an oppressive system; one could not expect anything else from them, than what the system required them to do. Focusing on individual personalities was a distraction from fighting the system they represented.

According to the German educationist Ute Grabowski,

{{Quotation|The [[German student movement|'68 student movement]] transformed the concept of character masks into a concept of struggle [''Kampbegriff''] – even although, originally, it was nothing more than a straightforward description of the inevitability of being driven into social roles together with other particular people, without being able to hold each of them individually responsible for that.&lt;ref&gt;Ute Grabowski, ''Berufliche Bildung und Persönlichkeitsentwicklung''. Deutsche Universitatsverlag/GWV Fachverlage GmbH, 2007, p. 87. Similarly the German sociologist [[Hans Joas]] argued that "The expression character mask... is only an incidental metaphor, which has been over-worked by interpretations which attribute to it a systematic position in Marx's thought." – Hans Joas, ''Die gegenwärtige Lage der soziologischen Rollentheorie''. Frankfurt: Athenäum, 1973, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The positive utopian longing emerging in the 1960s was that of reaching a life situation in which people would be able to meet each other naturally, spontaneously and authentically, freed from any constraints of rank or status, archaic rituals, arbitrary conventions and old traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Fredric Jameson, "On Goffman's Frame Analysis," Theory and Society 3, no. 1 (Spring 1976), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In their social criticism, the youth began to rebel against the roles which were formally assigned to them, and together with that, began to question the social theory of roles,&lt;ref&gt;R.W. Connell, "The concept of role and what to do with it". In: R.W. Connell, ''Which way is up? Essays on sex, class and culture.'' Sydney: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1983, pp. 189–207.&lt;/ref&gt; which presented those roles as natural, necessary and inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Caute]], ''The year of the barricades: a journey through 1968''. Harper Collins, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[women's liberation movement]] began to challenge gender roles as [[sexist]] and [[patriarchal]]. There seemed to be a big gap between the façade of roles, and the true nature of social relationships, getting in the way of personal authenticity (being "for real"). Official politics was increasingly regarded as the "masquerade" of those in power. To illustrate the spirit of the times, Anne-Marie Rocheblave-Spenlé who had previously authored a classic French text on role theory, in 1974 published a book titled, significantly, ''Le Pouvoir Demasque'' (Power unmasked).&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie Rocheblave-Spenlé, ''Le Pouvoir Demasque''. Paris: Editions Universitaires, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "character masks" was by no means an unimportant political concept in Germany, since it was being used explicitly by terrorists in their justifications for assassinating people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulrike Meinhof]], "Armed Anti-Imperialist Struggle (and the Defensive Position of the Counterrevolution in its Psychologic Warfare Against the People)". ''Semiotext(e)'' magazine, ed. by Sylvère Lotringer, Schizo-culture issue 1978. Reprinted in Chris Kraus and Sylvère Lotringer, ''Hatred of Capitalism: A Reader''. Los Angeles: Semiotext(e), 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ten points of controversy===
Questions subsequently arose in New Left circles about ten issues:

*whether behaviour is in truth an "act" or whether it is "for real", and how one could know or prove that (the problem of authenticity).&lt;ref&gt;This and some of the other issues are referred to by Christoph Henning, "Charaktermaske und Individualität bei Marx", in: ''Marx-Engels Jahrbuch 2009''. Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*whether character exists at all, if "masks mask other masks" in an endless series&lt;ref&gt;
See e.g. ''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/27682089/Character-Mapping Character Mapping]'' (resource on Scribd). See also e.g. Richard D. Hodgson, ''Falsehood disguised: unmasking the truth in [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]]''. Purdue University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
*how people make other people believe what their real character is (see also [[charisma]]).&lt;ref&gt;

*the extent to which the device of "character masks" is only an [[abstraction]] or a [[metaphor]],&lt;ref&gt;The power of metaphors in human thinking is dealt with in various books by [[George Lakoff]]. One Dutch scientific article exploring among other things the persuasive effect of the metaphor of "unmasking" is: Jan Bosman and Louk Hagendoorn, "Effects of literal and metaphorical persuasive messages", in: ''Metaphor and symbolic activity'', Vol. 6 No. 4, November 2009, pp. 271–292.&lt;/ref&gt; or whether it is a valid empirical description of aspects of real human behaviour in capitalist society.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Varon, ''Bringing the war home''.

German sociologist Uri Rapp theorized that ''Charaktermaske'' was not the same as "role"; rather ''Charaktermaske'' was a role forced on people, in a way that they could not really escape from it, i.e. all their vital relationships depended on it. People were compelled by the [[relations of production]]. Thus, he said, "every class membership is a Charaktermaske and even the ideological penetration of masquerades (the 'class consciousness of the proletariat') could not change or cast off character masks, only transcend them in thought." In addition, ''Charaktermaske'' was "present in the issue of the human being alienated from his own personality."&lt;ref&gt;Uri Rapp, ''Handeln und Zuschauen. Untersuchungen über den theatersoziologischen Aspekt in der menschlichen Interaktion.'' Darmstadt: Luchterhand, 1973, p. 147. Referred to by Munz, op. cit., p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean L. Cohen]] complained that:

{{Quotation|the concept of the character mask collapses the ''rationality of the system'' with the rationality of [[social action]], deriving the latter from the former... only action according to interests (imputed from the systemic logic of contradiction even if this logic is constituted by class relations) is ''rational action''. Accordingly, the very power of "class" to act as a critical concept vis-a-vis the logic of capitalist production relations is lost.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean L. Cohen]], ''Class and civil society: the limits of Marxian critical theory.'' Oxford: Martin Robertson, 1982 p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

As the post-war economic boom collapsed in the 1970s, and big changes in social roles occurred, these kinds of controversies stimulated a focus by social theorists on the "social construction of personal identity". A very large academic literature was subsequently published on this topic, exploring identity-formation from many different angles.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Donald Pollock, "Masks and the Semiotics of Identity." ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', Vol. 1, no. 3, 1995, pp. 581–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The discourse of identity resonated well with the concerns of adolescents and young adults who are finding their identity, and it has been a popular subject ever since. Another reason for the popularity of the topic, noted by [[Richard Sennett]] in his book ''The corrosion of character'', is the sheer number of different jobs people nowadays end up doing during their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Sennett]], ''The Corrosion of Character: the Personal Consequences Of Work In the New Capitalism''. New York: Norton, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; People then experience multiple changes of identity in their lifetime – their identity is no longer fixed once and for all.

===Humanism and anti-humanism===
Marx's "big picture" of capitalism often remained supremely abstract,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [[Geert Reuten]] &amp; Michael Williams, ''Value-form and the State. The Tendencies of Accumulation and the Determination of Economic Policy in Capitalist Society''. London: Routledge, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; although he claimed ordinary folks could understand his book.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Karl Marx to Ludwig Kugelmann, 11 July 1868. [[Marx/Engels Collected Works]], Vol. 43, p. 67.
 [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1868/letters/68_07_11.htm Marxists.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It seemed to many scholars that in Marx's ''Capital'' people become "passive subjects" trapped in a system which is beyond their control, and which forces them into functions and roles. Thus, it is argued that Marx's portrayal of the capitalist system in its totality is too "deterministic", because it downplays the ability of individuals as "active human subjects" to make [[Political freedom|free]] choices, and determine their own fate (see also [[economic determinism]]).&lt;ref&gt;For a commentary see e.g. Paul Blackledge, ''Marxism and Ethics; Freedom, Desire, and Revolution''. New York: SUNY Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical point is stated by [[Peter Sloterdijk]] as follows:

{{Quotation|As a theory of masks, [Marx's theory] distinguishes a priori between persons as individuals and as bearers of class functions. In doing so, it remains a little unclear which side is respectively the mask of the other – the individual the mask of the function, or the function the mask of individuality. The majority of critics have for good reasons, chosen the [[antihumanist]] version, the conception that individuality is the mask of the function.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Sloterdijk]], ''Critique of Cynical Reason'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In the antihumanist version, the individual is viewed as "a creation of the system" or "a product of society" who personifies a social function. In this case, a person selected to represent and express a function is no more than a functionary (or a "tool"): the person ''himself'' is the character mask adopted by the system or the organization of which he is part. Hidden behind the human face is the (inhuman) system which it operates. In the humanist version, the process is not one of personification, but rather of impersonation, in which case the function is merely a role acted out by the individual. Since the role acted out may in this case not have much to do with the individual's true personality, the mask-bearer and the mask he bears are, in this case, two different things – creating the possibility of a conflict between the bearer and the role he plays. Such a conflict is generally not possible in the antihumanist interpretation ("if you work for so-and-so, you are one of them"), since any "dysfunctional" character mask would simply be replaced by another.

====Louis Althusser's neo-Stalinism====
In the [[antihumanist]], [[structural-functionalist]] philosophy of the French Marxist [[Louis Althusser]], individuals as active subjects who have needs and make their own choices, and as people who "make their own history", are completely eradicated in the name of "science".&lt;ref&gt;[[Miriam Glucksmann]], ''Structuralist analysis in contemporary social thought. A comparison of Claude Levi-Strauss and Louis Althusser.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Althusser recommended the psychological theory of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]] in the French Communist Party journal ''La Nouvelle Critique'' specifically as a "science of the (human) ''unconscious''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Althusser]], "Freud and Lacan" (1964), in: Althusser, ''Lenin and philosophy and other essays''. London: NLB, 1971.
 [http://www.marx2mao.com/Other/LPOE70.html#s6 Marx2mao.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In the glossary of his famous book ''[[Reading Capital]]'' (co-written with [[Étienne Balibar]]), Althusser announces:

{{Quotation|The biological men are only the supports or bearers of the guises ("Charaktermasken") assigned to them by the structure of relations in the social formation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Althusser]] and [[Étienne Balibar]], ''Reading Capital''. London: New Left Books, 1970. According to this view, in the capitalist system human beings are "forced to be its actors, caught by the constraints of a script and parts whose authors they cannot be, since it is in essence an authorless theatre." (p. 193). [[André Glucksmann]] mocked this idea in his article "A Ventriloquist Structuralism." (In: ''New Left Review'', no. 72, March–April 1972, pp. 68–92). Anthony Giddens repeated the idea in his ''New Rules of Sociological Method'' (Hutchinson: London, 1976 p. 16), but as criticism of the structural functionalism of [[Talcott Parsons]]. Some of Althusser's British followers proclaimed that "Ultimately, all capitalists and all workers are ever-always identical, bearers of the same "character masks". How they function as bearers depends upon the conditions imposed by movements in the totality itself" (Anthony Cutler, Barry Hindess, Paul Hirst and Athar Hussain, ''Marx's Capital and Capitalism Today'', Vol. II, p. 242). According to [[Michael Perelman]], "the capitalist is, in Marx's wonderful expression, merely the character mask of capital". Perelman, "Articulation from feudalism to neoliberalism", in: ''Africanus: Journal of Development Studies'', Vol. 34 No. 2, 2007, p. 36. 
 [http://www.ukzn.ac.za/ccs/files/Bond%20(editor)%20Africanus%20Two%20Economies.pdf Ukzn.ac.za]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Critics of this idea argue people are not merely the "bearers" of social relations, they are also the "conscious operators" of social relations – social relations which would not exist at all, unless people consciously interacted and cooperated with each other. The real analytical difficulty in social science is, that people both make their social relations, but also participate in social relations which they did not make or consciously choose themselves. Some roles in society are consciously and voluntarily chosen by individuals, other roles are conferred on people simply by being and participating in society with a given status. Some roles are also a mixture of both: once people have chosen a role, they may have that role, whether they like it or not; or, once habituated to role, people continue to perform the role even although they could in principle choose to abandon it. That is why both the humanist and the antihumanist interpretations of character masks can have some validity in different situations.

====Marxism as a character mask?====
Althusser's "totalizing perspective"&lt;ref&gt;Selbourne, "Two essays on method", ''Critique: Journal of Socialist Theory'', Vol. 10 No. 1, pp. 77–78. Althusserian theoreticism was ridiculed by the historian [[E. P. Thompson]] in ''The Poverty of Theory and Other Essays''. London: Merlin Press, 1978, but defended by [[Perry Anderson]] in his 1980 book ''Arguments within English Marxism''.&lt;/ref&gt; – which, by destroying the [[dialectics]] of experience, cannot reconcile the ways in which people "make history" and are "made by history", and therefore falls from one contradiction into another – does not just destroy belief in the power of human action (because "the system" dominates everything); the super-human approach also invites the objection that it leads to [[totalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], ''Critique of Dialectical Reason'', Vols. 1 and 2. London: Verso, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, in the bid of Marxist ideologists to grab state power, extract a surplus from the workers and manage the introduction of the "new order", armed with an ideological tyranny of categories, real human beings become expendable.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [[György Konrád]] and [[Iván Szelényi]] ''The Intellectuals on the Road to Class Power''. Harcourt, Brace and Jovanovich, 1979 and [[Alvin W. Gouldner]], ''The future of the intellectuals and the rise of the new class''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1979. Similar theories of a [[new class]] were proposed by [[Michael Voslensky]] (Russia), [[Miklós Haraszti]] (Hungary), [[Milovan Đilas]] and Svetozar Stojanović (Yugoslavia), [[Jacek Kuroń]] and [[Karol Modzelewski]] (Poland). For a range of different theories, see Marcel van der Linden, ''Western Marxism and the Soviet Union. A survey of critical theories and debates since 1917''. Haymarket books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is alleged to be a kind of "upward mobility" strategy utilizing sympathy for the oppressed and exploited, and social envy. This (fairly cynical) interpretation leads logically to the idea that [[Marxism]] or [[Marxism–Leninism]] is itself a character mask, by which leftists who are desirous of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and [[Social influence|influence]] which they do not have, disguise their real motives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]''. New York: Random House, 1989, p. 51. See: Žižek, "Georg Lukács as the Philosopher of [[Leninism]]", in: [[György Lukács]], ''A Defence of History and Class Consciousness: Tailism and the Dialectic''. New York: Verso, 2002, pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt; This is hotly disputed by many Marxists, who claim Marxism is something that grows out of their lives.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===The sociological imagination===
[[C. Wright Mills]] developed a concept known as the [[sociological imagination]], the idea being that understanding the link between "private troubles" and "public issues" requires creative insight by the researchers, who are personally involved in what they try to study. The analytical question for social scientists then is, how much the concept of "character masks" can really explain, or whether its application is overextended or overworked.

For example, [[Jon Elster]] argued that:

{{Quotation|Capitalist entrepreneurs are ''agents'' in the genuinely active sense. They cannot be reduced to mere placeholders in the capitalist system of production. This view goes against a widespread interpretation of Marx. It is often said that he attached little importance to intentional explanation in economics, since the basic units of his theory are "character masks" rather than individuals. The capitalist, in particular, is only the "conscious support" of the capitalist process, and only enacts the laws regulating it. Even capitalist [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] can be seen as "capital's expense of reproduction". This is well in line with the view that the worker is the passive embodiment of his consumption bundle, rather than an active human being capable, among other things, of waging a struggle for a larger bundle. The conclusion often drawn from this argument is that the capitalist does not "choose" his actions, but is "forced" by his need to survive in the competitive market. I believe this way of stating the issue is misleading. "Choosing" only means comparing alternatives and picking the best of them. The choice may well be said to be forced if all alternatives but one are unacceptable, but it is no less of a choice for that. Rather, the relevant distinction is that between forced and unforced choice, for example between being forced to optimize and not being forced to do so. This distinction might for instance serve to distinguish between capitalists at different stages of capitalist development, as suggested by Weber.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Elster]], ''Making sense of Marx''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Jürgen Ritsert, a Frankfurt sociologist, queried the utility of the concept of character masks:
{{Quotation|are there special concepts in Marx's ''Critique of Political Economy'' which could mediate an application of the general concept of a specific historical totality to singular acts and particular act-meanings? Usually "Charaktermaske" (character mask) is mentioned as such a concept.... I do not think that "Charaktermaske" is one of the sought after decisive mediating terms.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Ritser, "Totality, theory and historical analysis, remarks on critical sociology and empirical research". In: [[Iring Fetscher]] et. al., ''Social classes, action and historical materialism''. Poznań studies in the philosophy of the sciences and the humanities, Vol. 6. Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1982, p. 332.

===Sociobiology===
Faced with the problem of understanding human character masks – which refers to how human beings have to deal with the relationship between the "macro-world" (the big world) and the "micro-world" (the small world)&lt;ref&gt;*Christian Fuchs, Wolfgang Hofkirchner and Bert Klauninger, Vienna University of Technology INTAS Project "[http://www.self-organization.org/results/papers/pdf/hsicpaper8.pdf Human Strategies in Complexity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310185122/http://www.self-organization.org/results/papers/pdf/hsicpaper8.pdf |date=March 10, 2012 }}" Paper, No. 8, delivered at the Congress "Problems of Individual Emergence", Amsterdam, April, 16th–20th 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; – scholarship has often flip-flopped rather uneasily between [[structuralism]] and [[subjectivism]], inventing dualisms between [[structure and agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, ''The new spirit of Capitalism''. London: Verso, 2005, p. x. See e.g. [[Perry Anderson]], ''Arguments within English Marxism''. Random House Inc., 1980. The sociological debate about structure and agency is reviewed by [[George Ritzer]] in ''Modern sociological theory''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The academic popularity of [[structural-functionalism]] has declined, "role definitions" have become more and more changeable and vague, and the Althusserian argument has been inverted: human behaviour is explained in terms of [[sociobiology]].&lt;ref&gt;See: "A biological understanding of human nature: a talk with Steve Pinker", 9 September 2002. [http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/pinker_blank/pinker_blank_print.html Edge.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, "the person" is identified with "the physical body". This is closer to Marx's idea of "the economic formation of society as a process of natural history", but often at the cost of "naturalizing" (eternalizing) social phenomena which belong to a specific historical time – by replacing their real, man-made ''social'' causes with alleged ''biological'' factors. On this view, humans (except ourselves) are essentially, and mainly, animals. The treatment of humans as if they are animals is itself a strategy of domination.&lt;ref&gt;Staff reporter, "Foxconn chairman likens his workforce to animals", ''WantChinaTimes'' (Taipei), 19 January 2012.{{cite web |url=http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id%3D20120119000111%26cid%3D1102 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121015038/http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20120119000111&amp;cid=1102 |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postmodernism===
The more recent [[postmodern]] criticism of Marx's portrayal of character masks concerns mainly the two issues of [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]] and [[privacy]].

It is argued that modern capitalism has moved far beyond the type of capitalism that Marx knew.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Castells, ''The Power of Identity. The Information Age: Economy, Society, and Culture, Volume II''. Second edition, Chichester, UK: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Capitalist development has changed the nature of people themselves, and how one's life will go is more and more unpredictable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodor W. Adorno]], ''[[Minima Moralia]]'' [1951]. London: Verso, 2005, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no longer any clear and consensual view of how "personal identity" or "human character" should be defined anyway (other than by identity cards)&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Marie Rosenau, ''Post-modernism and the social sciences: insights, inroads, and intrusions.'' Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore, it is also no longer clear what it means to "mask" them, or what interests that can serve.&lt;ref&gt;Amalia Rosenblum, "Goodbye to privacy". ''[[Ha'aretz]]'', 11 November 2010. [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/goodbye-to-privacy-1.324085 Haaretz.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Roles are constantly being redefined to manipulate power relationships, and shunt people up or down the hierarchy.

The postmodern concept of human identity – however it may be theorized – maximizes the flexibility, variability and plasticity of human behaviour, so that the individual can "be and do many different things, in many different situations", without any necessary requirement of continuity between different "acts" in space and time. The effect however is a lack of coherence; it becomes much more difficult to know or define what the identity of someone truly is. As soon as the self is viewed as a performance, masking becomes an intrinsic aspect of the self, since there still exists an "I" which directs the performance and which therefore simultaneously "reveals and conceals" itself. The corollary is, that it becomes much more difficult to ''generalize'' about human beings, since even at the most basic level the categories or units used to make comparisons remain vague. At most, one can objectively measure the incidence and frequency of different types of observable behaviour.

Aggregate human behaviour is then often explained either as a biological effect or as a statistical effect, estimated by [[probability theory]]. Some Marxists regard this perspective as a form of [[dehumanization]], which signifies a deepening of human alienation, and leads to a return to [[religion]] to define humanity. Modern [[information technology]] and the [[sexual revolution]], it is nowadays argued, have radically altered the whole idea of what is "[[public sphere|public]]" and what is "[[private sphere|private]]".&lt;ref&gt;See further e.g. [[Jürgen Habermas]], ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1991 and Christian Fuchs, "Towards an alternative concept of privacy". ''Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society'', Vol. 9 No. 4, 2011, pp. 220–237. [http://fuchs.uti.at/papers/social-theory/ Fuchs.uti.at]&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, information technology becomes a tool for [[social control]]. Some Marxists even refer to the spectre of ''totalitarian capitalism''.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. George Liodakis, ''Totalitarian Capitalism and Beyond''. Farnham: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Human individuals then appear to be caught up in a stressful battle to defend their own definition of themselves against the definitions imposed or attributed by others, in which they can become trapped.

====Kurz and Lohoff====
In their famous 1989 article "The class struggle fetish", the German neo-Marxists Robert Kurz and Ernst Lohoff reached the conclusion that the working class is ultimately just "the character mask of [[variable capital]]", a logical "real category" of Capital. The identities of all members of capitalist society, they argued, are ultimately formed as bourgeois character masks of [[Valorisation|self-valorizing value]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kurz and Ernst Lohoff, "Der Klassenkampf-Fetisch. Thesen zur Entmythologisierung des Marxismus." in: ''Marxistischen Kritik'' Nr. 7, 1989. [http://www.exit-online.org/html/link.php?tab=schwerpunkte&amp;kat=Der%20doppelte%20Marx%20-%20Kritik%20des%20Traditionsmarxismus&amp;ktext=Der%20Klassenkampf-Fetisch Exit-online.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, people are valued according to the extent that they can make money for themselves, or for others.

====Žižek====
[[Slavoj Žižek]] also attempts to create a new theory of masks, by mixing together the philosophies of [[Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Jacques Lacan]] with his understanding of fictional literature and political events.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [[Slavoj Žižek]] (ed.), ''Lacan: The Silent Partners.'' London: Verso, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In Žižek's theory, just as an oppressive social reality cannot exist and persist without ideological mystification, "The mask is not simply hiding the real state of things; the ideological distortion is written into [the] very essence [of the real state of things]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Slavoj Žižek]], ''The sublime object of ideology''. London: Verso, 1989, pp. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the mask is a necessary and integral component of an oppressive reality, and it is not possible simply to tear away the mask to reveal the oppressive reality underneath.

In ''The sublime object of ideology'', Žižek summarizes [[Peter Sloterdijk]]'s concept of cynical reason:

{{Quotation|The cynical subject is quite aware of the distance between the ideological mask and the social reality, but he none the less still insists upon the mask. The formula, as proposed by Sloterdijk, would then be: "they know very well what they are doing, but still, they are doing it". Cynical reason is no longer naïve, but is a paradox of an enlightened [[false consciousness]]: one knows the falsehood very well, one is well aware of a particular interest hidden behind an ideological universality, but still one does not renounce it.&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek, ''The sublime object of ideology''. London: Verso, 1989, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Often the pretense is kept up, because of a belief (or anxiety) that the alternative – i.e. dropping the pretense – would have a worse effect, or seriously compromise cherished values or beliefs. To maintain and build a team spirit or morale, a way of working is insisted on which affirms shared beliefs, regardless of whether those beliefs correspond to reality or not, and regardless of whether members of the organization are aware of the discrepancies or not. The result, Žižek claims, is a "symbolic order" of "fetishist disavowal" in which people act morally "as if" they are related in certain ways – to the point where "the symbolic mask matters more than the direct reality of the individual who wears this mask."&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek, ''Ideology III: to read too many books is harmful''. Lacan.com, 1997. [http://www.lacan.com/zizchemicalbeats.html Lacan.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Using a basically Freudian theory, Žižek then aims to explain the psychological processes by which people are reconciled with the symbolic order, or at least make it "liveable" for themselves (see also [[Freudo-Marxism]]).

[[Frank Furedi]] suggests that the concept of denial, so central to Žižek's understanding of masks, really plays a quite different role in contemporary post-Freudian society: "In today's therapy culture, people who express views that contradict our own are often told that they are 'in denial'. It has become a way of discrediting their viewpoint, or shutting them up."&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Furedi]], "Denial", in: ''Spiked'', 31 January 2007.{{cite web|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2792/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709062723/http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2792/ |archivedate=2012-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If people disagree, or will not cooperate, they are not taken seriously in a dialogue, but instead accused of having a psychological problem which stands in need of professional treatment. Thus, a dissident is neutralized by being turned into a patient who is "unhealthy", and people are managed according to psychotherapeutic concepts designed to invalidate their own meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Furedi, ''Therapy Culture: Cultivating Vulnerability in an Uncertain Age''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Furedi implies that yesterday's leftist concepts can be recycled as today's tools for [[psychological manipulation]]: an idea which originally had a progressive intention can evolve until, in reality, it plays the very opposite role – even although (and precisely because) people continue to sentimentally cherish the old idea. The point is not simply to interpret the processes by which oppressed people are reconciled with, or reproduce their own oppression ([[Louis Althusser|Althusser]]'s and [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]'s structuralist theory of "ideological reproduction"); the challenge is to create new ideas which can free the oppressed out of their oppression. For this purpose, ideas have to be situated according to how they are ''actually being used'' in the real world, and the oppressed have to be regarded as active subjects who can change their own fate (not simply as the "clients" of officials, academics and professionals who monitor their behaviour).

[[Philip Rieff]] summarizes the main problem with, as well as the main achievement of psychoanalysis, from the point of view of freeing people from the masks that may oppress them:

{{Quotation|Freud carried the scientific suspicion of nature into ethics. It was as if, after all the pronouncements of theology and philosophy, after all the indications of experience, we had scarcely begun to understand ourselves... [According to Freud] our inner nature – the ultimate subject studied by all the moral sciences – ''lies hidden''. Against the conventional assumption that each knows himself best in his own heart, Freud supports the [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] assumption that each is farthest from his own self, and must journey through experience in search of it. He surpasses even the [[Romanticism|Romantics]] in his deprecation of mere intellect.... To "know thyself" is to be known by another [i.e. by the psychoanalyst].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Rieff]], ''Freud: the mind of a moralist''. London: Methuen, 1965, pp. 69–70, emphasis added.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

If it is true that "we do not even know who we are", then it becomes difficult to understand how people could free themselves from deceptive masks, and change the world for the better, unless they all get a massive dose of psychotherapy to "find themselves".

==Unmasking==
If one successfully unmasks something, one understands it for what it really is, and can handle it; inversely, if one understands something and can handle it, it is unmasked.&lt;ref&gt;Fritjof Bönold states: "Marx selber hatte den widersprüchlichen Begriff Charaktermaske verwendet. Er betont einerseits die Einprägung (Charakter) der gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse in die Person, andererseits die Möglichkeit der Demaskierung."["Marx himself used the contradictory term character mask. He stressed on the one hand the imprinting (character) of social relations in the person, yet on the other hand the possibility of unmasking."] – Bönold, "Zur Kritik der Geschlechtsidentitätstheorie", p. 14 note 11.{{cite web|url=http://www.fk12.tu-dortmund.de/cms/ISO/de/arbeitsbereiche/soziologie_der_geschlechterverhaeltnisse/Medienpool/AIM_Beitraege_dritte_Tagung/fritjof_boenold.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719095808/http://www.fk12.tu-dortmund.de/cms/ISO/de/arbeitsbereiche/soziologie_der_geschlechterverhaeltnisse/Medienpool/AIM_Beitraege_dritte_Tagung/fritjof_boenold.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }} See further his essay "Die (un)abgeschlossene Debatte um Gleichheit oder/ und Differenz in der pädagogischen Frauenforschung". In: ''Zeitschrift für Frauenforschung &amp; Geschlechterstudien'', Vol. 22, issue 1, 2004, pp. 18–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, as Marx notes, "in the analysis of economic forms neither microscopes nor chemical [[reagents]] are of assistance. The power of [[abstraction]] must replace both."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', Penguin, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic analysis not only studies the total social effect of human actions, which is usually not directly observable to an individual, other than in the form of [[statistics]] or television.{{clarification|date=February 2017}} The "economic actors" are also human beings who ''create'' interactions and relationships which have human meanings. Those meanings cannot be observed directly, they are in people's heads, actively created in their [[social relationship]]s, and expressed symbolically.

===Collapse===
Capitalism unmasks itself in the course of development, when its internal contradictions become so great, that they cause collapse – impelling the revolutionary transformation of capitalism by human action into a new social order, amidst all the political conflicts and class struggles.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', Penguin, p. 929. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch32.htm Marxists.org] The concept of collapse is denied by many Marxists, but in the history of capitalism undeniably many countries have experienced such a collapse. This, however, did not lead automatically to socialism, and it did not prevent business from reviving after a few years. Capitalism can collapse, but it can also recover.&lt;/ref&gt; In trying to get on top of the relations they have created, human beings are themselves transformed. Scientific inquiry, Marx felt, should be an aid in the cause of human progress, to ensure that the new social order emerging will be a real [[open society]]. Human progress is achieved, to the degree that people abolish the oppressions of people by other people, and oppressions by the blind forces of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume III]]'', Penguin ed., pp. 958–959.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cildo Meireles''' (born 1948) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[conceptual art]]ist, [[installation artist]] and [[sculptor]]. He is noted especially for his installations, many of which express resistance to political oppression in Brazil. These works, often large and dense, encourage a phenomenological experience via the viewer's interaction.

==Life==
Meireles was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1948. From an early age, Meireles showed a keen interest in drawing and spatial relations. He was especially interested in how this has been explored in animated film.&lt;ref name="Farmer"&gt;Farmer, John Allen. “Through the Labyrinth: An Interview with Cildo Meireles.” Art Journal 59, no. 3 (2000): 34-43&lt;/ref&gt; His father, who encouraged Meireles' creativity, worked for the Indian Protection Service and their family traveled extensively within rural Brazil.&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/cildomeireles/about.shtm Tate: About Cildo Meireles]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Nuria Enguita, Meireles described a time when he was "seven or eight" and living in the countryside that had a huge impact on him. He said that he was startled by an impoverished man wandering through the trees. The next day, the young Meireles went to investigate, but the man was gone and only a small but perfect hut the man had apparently made the night before remained. Meireles said that this hut "was perhaps the most decisive thing for the path [he] followed in life...The possibility one has of making things and leaving them for others."&lt;ref name="Enguita"&gt;Enguita, Nuria. "Places for Digressions." in ''Cildo Meireles'' by Cildo Meireles. Valencia: IVAM, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in rural Brazil, Meireles learned the beliefs of the [[Tupi people]] which he later incorporated into some of his works in order to highlight their marginalization in, or complete disappearance from, Brazilian society and politics.&lt;ref name="g"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/11/cildo-meireles Guardian: Living dangerously]&lt;/ref&gt; Installations which contain allusions to the Tupi include ''Southern Cross'' (1969–70) and ''Olvido'' (1990). Meireles cites [[Orson Welles]]' 1938 radio broadcast ''[[War of the Worlds]]'' as one of the greatest works of art of the 20th century because it "seamlessly dissolved the border between art and life, fiction and reality."&lt;ref name="Farmer"/&gt; Recreating this concept of total audience investment was an important artistic goal of Meireles that is seen throughout his body of work.

He began his study of art in 1963 at the District Federal Cultural Foundation in [[Brasilia]], under the Peruvian painter and ceramist [[Felix Barrenechea]].&lt;ref&gt;Angélica Madeira: [http://www.unb.br/ics/sol/urbanidades/angelicamadeira.htm Conceptual Art in an authoritarian political context. Brazil, Brasília: 1967 – 1979]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, Meireles discovered the work of [[Hélio Oiticica]] and [[Lygia Clark]], thereby introducing him to the Brazilian [[Neo-Concrete]] movement.&lt;ref name="Mosquera"&gt;Cameron, Dan, Paulo Herkenoff, and Gerardo Mosquera. Cildo Meireles. London: Phaidon Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; These artists, as well as Meireles, were all concerned with blurring the boundary between what is art and what is life, and responding to current political situations within their pieces.&lt;ref name="Farmer"/&gt;

Meireles unintentionally participated in a political demonstration in April 1964, when he was sixteen years old. He has cited this moment has his "political awakening" and began to take an interest in student politics.&lt;ref name="Mosquera"/&gt; In 1967 he moved to Rio de Janeiro and studied at the [[Escola Nacional de Belas Artes]].&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

Meireles currently lives and works in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name="tate"/&gt;

==Career==

Meireles has stated that drawing was his main artistic medium until 1968, when he altogether abandoned expressionistic drawing in favor of designing things that he wanted to physically construct.&lt;ref name="Mosquera" /&gt; A topic that he especially explored in his art was the concept of the ephemeral and the non-object, art that only exists with interaction, which prompted him to create installation pieces or situational art.&lt;ref name="Farmer"/&gt; This led to his ''Virtual Spaces'' project, which he began in 1968. This project was "based on Euclidian principles of space" and sought to show how objects in space can be defined by three different planes. He modeled this concept as a series of environments made to look like corners in rooms.&lt;ref name="Mosquera"/&gt;

Following the [[military coup]] in 1964, Meireles became involved in political art. When Meireles was "first getting started as an artist," governmental censorship of various forms of media, including art, was standard in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;Frank, Patrick. ''Readings in Latin American Modern Art''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008. 223-226.&lt;/ref&gt; Meireles found ways to create art that was subversive but subtle enough to make public by taking inspiration from Dadaist art, which he notes had the ability to seem "tame" and "ironic."&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;  In the early 1970s he developed a political art project that aimed to reach a wide audience while avoiding [[censorship]] called ''Insertions Into Ideological Circuits'', which was continued until 1976. Many of his installation pieces since this time have taken on political themes, though now his art is "less overtly political."&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt;

He was one of the founders of the Experimental Unit of the Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio de Janeiro in 1969 and in 1975, edited the art magazine ''Malasartes''.&lt;ref name=biog&gt;[http://www.mcu.es/promoArte/docs/Cildo_Meireles.pdf Spanish Culture Ministry: Biography] (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Meireles was honoured with a [[Prince Claus Award]] and in 2008 he won the Velazquez Plastic Arts Award, presented by the Ministry of Culture of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcu.es/premios/VelazquezPremiados.html Premio Velázquez de Artes Plásticas] (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key Works==

===''Red Shift'' (1967-84)===
A large-scale, three-room exploration of an entirely red environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/cildomeireles/rooms/room4.shtm Tate: Room 4 (Red Shift)]&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the installation refers both to the scientific concept of chromatic shift (or [[chromatic aberration]]) as well as to the idea of a "shift" as a displacement or deviation.&lt;ref name="Brito"&gt;Brito, Ronaldo. "''Desvio para o vermelho'' (Red Shift), 1967-84". ''Espaço de Arte Brasileira Contemporânea'', Museu de Arte Moderna. Rio de Janeiro: 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first room, called ''Impregnation'', is approximately 50 m² and filled with a number of everyday, domestic objects in a variety of different shades of red. The effect is an overwhelming visual saturation of the color. Upon entering the room, the participant experiences an initial shock from the visual inundation of red. Dan Cameron writes that "one's gaze is literally thwarted in an effort to gain a purchase on the specificity of things."&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;Cameron, Dan. "''Desvio para o vermelho (Red Shift)'', 1967-84." in ''Cildo Meireles'' by Dan Cameron, Paulo Herkenhoff, and Gerardo Mosquera. London: Phaidon Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its lack of chromatic differentiation, the environment appears to lack depth. Cameron argues that the longer a participant stays in the room the more aware they become of the color's negative, unsettling psychological impact on them.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt;

The second room is called ''Spill/Environment'' and consists solely of a large pool of red ink spilled from a small bottle on the floor, evoking mental associations with blood. The amount of liquid on the floor in comparison to the amount which the bottle could conceivably hold is disproportionate. The redness on the floor extends throughout the small room to the edge of the darkened third room, an effect which lends itself to feelings of foreboding and uncertainty.

The third room, ''Shift'', contains a washbasin attached to the wall at a 30° angle illuminated by a direct beam of overhead light. A red stream pours into the washbasin from a tap, also at a 30° angle, allowing the liquid to pool in the sink before draining. The feelings of disturbance experienced by the participant throughout the installation culminate in this final room. Since the room is completely dark, the sole focus is placed on the washbasin.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; While the connotations of blood which appear throughout the installation are at first rather vague, like in the initial saturation of red in the first room and in the ink spill of the second room, in the third room this association with blood becomes much more explicit, creating a final, visceral reaction to the color within the participant.

Art historian Anne Dezeuze has commented that the "cinematic" installation as a whole articulates a certain sense of menace within participants because of the intense repetition of the color red throughout the three rooms.&lt;ref name="Dezeuze"&gt;Dezeuze, Anna. "Cildo Meireles." ''Artforum International'' 47, no. 8 (2009): 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of Meireles' other artworks, ''Red Shift'' takes on political undertones when examined in light of Brazil's military dictatorship which lasted throughout the creation and exhibition of this piece.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; For instance, the red liquid pouring into the washbasin has been seen by some art historians as a visual representation of the blood of victims murdered by government authorities.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt;

===''Southern Cross'' (1969-70)===
A minimalist sculpture, on a Lilliputian scale: Meireles calls it an example of “humiliminimalism” – a humble brand of minimalism. He wanted it to be even smaller, “but when [he] sanded it down to [his] nails, [he] lost patience and stopped at nine millimeters." Unlike most minimalist sculptures it is no mere object, but it is meant to be as richly symbolic, sensuous and potent as an amulet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= A Tiny Wooden Cube as a Site of Crosscultural Friction and Collision|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?page_id=13616|work=InEnArt|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each half of the tiny 9mm by 9mm by 9mm cube is made of pine and oak. These two types of wood are considered sacred by the Tupi people of Brazil.&lt;ref name="Herkenhoff"&gt;"A Labyrinthine Ghetto: The Work of Cildo Meireles." in ''Cildo Meireles'' by Dan Cameron, Paulo Herkenhoff, and Gerardo Mosquera. London: Phaidon Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The title refers to an unofficial geographical (and metaphysical) region that lies to the west of [[Tordesillas]]. According to Meireles in a statement he made about the artwork in 1970, this region is "the wild side, the jungle in one's head, without the lustre of intelligence or reason...our origins." It is a place where "there are only individual truths."&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; In the same statement, he notes that he wants ''Southern Cross'' to be perceived as a physical representation of the memory of the Tupi ("people whose history is legends and fables") and a warning to modernity of the growing self-confidence of the primordial which will eventually result in an overtaking of the urban by the natural.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; Meireles' statement is also political. It is a caution against indifference, especially against indifference towards Brazil's fading indigenous population. The tiny cube is meant to be placed alone in the middle of an empty room in order to emphasize the reality and the power of indigenous belief systems in the context of Eurocentric modernism.

===''Insertions Into Ideological Circuits'' (1970-76)===
An art project with political undertones that was designed to reach a mass-audience. This project manifested in multiple ways, two of the most well-known being the ''Coca-Cola'' project, and the ''Banknote'' project. ''Insertions Into Ideological Circuits'' was based upon three principles as defined by Meireles: 1) In society there are certain mechanisms for circulation (circuits); 2) these circuits clearly embody the ideology of the producer, but at the same time they are passive when they receive insertions into the circuit; 3) and this occurs whenever people initiate them.&lt;ref name="Meireles"&gt;''Cildo Meireles.'' Valencia: IVAM, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of ''Insertions...'' was to literally insert some kind of counter-information or critical thought into a large system of circulated information. Meireles inserted something that is physically the same, though ideologically different, into a pre-existing system in order to counteract the original circuit without disrupting it. The project was achieved by printing images and messages onto various items that were already widely circulated and which had value discouraging them being destroyed, such as [[Coca-Cola]] bottles (which were recycled by way of a deposit scheme) and banknotes. Meireles screen-printed texts onto the [[Coca-Cola]] bottles that were supposed to encourage the buyer to become aware of their personal role in a consumerist society.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; The project simultaneously conveyed anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist messages. Building off of that concept, Meireles also used money as a theme and produced his own replica banknotes and coins (1974–1978) which appeared very similar to genuine Brazilian and US currency but with zero denominations clearly written on them, e.g. ''Zero Dollar''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/cildomeireles/rooms/room1.shtm Tate: Room 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Putting an Olive Stone into a Bottle|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?p=13218|work=InEnArt|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mieireles also wrote critiques of the Brazilian government on the banknotes, such as "Who killed Herzog?" (in reference to journalist [[Vladimir Herzog]]), "Yankees go home!" and "Direct elections."&lt;ref name="Mosquera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dezeuze"/&gt;

===''Through'' (1983-89)===
A labyrinthine structure which invites the visitor to walk across eight tons of broken plate glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/cildomeireles/rooms/room2.shtm Tate: Room 2]&lt;/ref&gt; The maze is composed of "velvet museum ropes, street barriers, garden fences, blinds, railings, and aquariums" and in the center of it is a three-meter ball of cellophane.&lt;ref name="Merewether"&gt;Meireles, Cildo and Charles Merewether. “Memory of the Senses.” Grand Street, no. 64 (1998): 221-223&lt;/ref&gt; Meireles notes that an essential part of ''Through'' is the sense of psychological unease that comes from the participant's realization of the different sensory capacities and capabilities between the eyes and the body.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; For instance, the eyes can see through the glass parts of the work, but the body is physically impeded from passing through parts of the space. Furthermore, the sound of crunching glass underfoot while navigating the maze can be off-putting. He wanted the participant to experience psychological tension between the appreciation of the sonic and the appreciation of the visual. The work, Meireles says, "is based on the notion of an excess of obstacles and prohibitions."&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt; Meireles drew some of his inspiration for this installation from writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]], whose subject matter sometimes included the concept of the [[labyrinth]].  Meireles also wanted the participant to experience feelings of awareness and attentiveness that come from walking a labyrinth.&lt;ref name="Farmer"/&gt;

===''Babel'' (2001)===
A tower of hundreds of radios, each just audible and tuned to stations of different languages to evoke resonances of the [[Tower of Babel]] in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/exhibitions/cildomeireles/rooms/room6.shtm Tate: Room 6 (Babel)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, before the destruction of the Tower of Babel by God, every person on Earth spoke the same language. Meireles' ''Babel'' acknowledges the multiplicity of language that resulted from the Tower's destruction in the story. The artwork contradicts the notion of one universal language, emphasizing that the pursuit of commonality is futile. Paul Herkenhoff points out that ''Babel'' also has autobiographical meaning for Meireles, as radio was a common method of widespread communication in Brazil during the artist's youth.&lt;ref name="Herkenhoff2"&gt;Herkenhoff, Paulo. "Learning and Dislearning to be Global: Questions at 44°53′ N, 93°13′ W, and 22°54′24″ S, 43°10′21″ W." ''How Latitudes Become Forms''. [http://latitudes.walkerart.org/images/text/herkenhoff_lattitudes.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The work also speaks to globalization. Meireles parallels the unity of humanity before the fall of the Tower of Babel with the present-day unity which has resulted from globalization despite numerous language barriers.

==Exhibitions==

Meireles considers his first exhibition to have occurred in 1965, when one of his canvases and two of his drawings were accepted by the Segundo Salão Nacional de Arte Moderna in Brasilia.&lt;ref name="Meireles"/&gt;

A retrospective of his work was presented at the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]] in New York in 1999 and then traveled to the Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio de Janeiro and the [[São Paulo Museum of Modern Art]]. In conjunction with the exhibition, a book entitled ''Cildo Meireles'', was published by [[Phaidon Press]] (1999).

The first extensive presentation of the artist’s work in the UK opened at [[Tate Modern]] in October 2008. Meireles was the first Brazilian artist to be given a full retrospective by [[Tate]].&lt;ref name="g"/&gt; This exhibition then moved to the Museu d'Art Contemporani in Barcelona, and later to the Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo (MUAC) in Mexico City until January 10, 2010.

Meireles' most recent exhibition took place in Milan's HangarBicocca museum from March 27 to July 20, 2014. It featured twelve of his most renowned works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hangarbicocca.org/exhibitions/what-s-on/Cildo-Meireles-Installations/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826113631/http://www.hangarbicocca.org/exhibitions/what-s-on/Cildo-Meireles-Installations/ |archivedate=2014-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40138">In [[ring theory]], a branch of [[abstract algebra]], a '''commutative ring''' is a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] in which the multiplication operation is [[commutative]]. The study of commutative rings is called [[commutative algebra]]. Complementarily, [[noncommutative algebra]] is the study of [[noncommutative ring]]s where multiplication is not required to be commutative.

{{Algebraic structures |Ring}}

==Definition and first examples==

===Definition===
{{details|topic=the definition of rings|Ring (mathematics)}}
A ''ring'' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''R'' equipped with two [[binary operation]]s, i.e. operations combining any two elements of the ring to a third. They are called ''addition'' and ''multiplication'' and commonly denoted by "+" and "⋅"; e.g. {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' ⋅ ''b''}}. To form a ring these two operations have to satisfy a number of properties: the ring has to be an [[abelian group]] under addition as well as a [[monoid]] under multiplication, where multiplication [[distributive law|distributes]] over addition; i.e., {{nowrap|1=''a'' ⋅ (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' ⋅ ''b'') + (''a'' ⋅ ''c'')}}. The identity elements for addition and multiplication are denoted 0 and 1, respectively.

If the multiplication is commutative, i.e.
:''a'' ⋅ ''b'' = ''b'' ⋅ ''a'',
then the ring ''R'' is called ''commutative''. In the remainder of this article, all rings will be commutative, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

===First examples===
An important example, and in some sense crucial, is the [[integer|ring of integer]]s '''Z''' with the two operations of addition and multiplication. As the multiplication of integers is a commutative operation, this is a commutative ring. It is usually denoted '''Z''' as an abbreviation of the [[German language|German]] word ''Zahlen'' (numbers).

A [[field (mathematics)|field]] is a commutative ring where &lt;math&gt; 0 \not = 1 &lt;/math&gt; and every [[0 (number)|non-zero]] element ''a'' is invertible; i.e., has a multiplicative inverse ''b'' such that ''a'' ⋅ ''b'' = 1. Therefore, by definition, any field is a commutative ring. The [[rational number|rational]], [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s form fields.

If ''R'' is a given commutative ring, then the set of all [[polynomial]]s in the variable ''X'' whose coefficients are in ''R'' forms the [[polynomial ring]], denoted ''R''[''X'']. The same holds true for several variables.

If ''V'' is some [[topological space]], for example a subset of some '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, real- or complex-valued [[continuous function]]s on ''V'' form a commutative ring. The same is true for [[differentiable function|differentiable]] or [[holomorphic function]]s, when the two concepts are defined, such as for ''V'' a [[complex manifold]].

==Divisibility==
In contrast to fields, where every nonzero element is multiplicatively invertible, the concept of [[divisibility (ring theory)|divisibility for rings]] is richer. An element ''a'' of ring ''R'' is called a [[unit (algebra)|unit]] if it possesses a multiplicative inverse. Another particular type of element is the [[zero divisor]]s, i.e. a non-zero element ''a'' such that there exists a non-zero element ''b'' of the ring such that ''ab = 0''. If ''R'' possesses no zero divisors, it is called an [[integral domain]] (or domain). An element ''a'' satisfying ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 for some positive integer ''n'' is called [[nilpotent element|nilpotent]].

===Localizations===
{{Main|Localization of a ring}}
The ''localization'' of a ring is a process in which some elements are rendered invertible, i.e. multiplicative inverses are added to the ring. Concretely, if ''S'' is a [[multiplicatively closed subset]] of ''R'' (i.e. whenever ''s'', ''t'' ∈ ''S'' then so is ''st'') then the ''localization'' of ''R'' at ''S'', or ''ring of fractions'' with denominators in ''S'', usually denoted ''S''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''R'' consists of symbols
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{r}{s}&lt;/math&gt; with ''r'' ∈ ''R'', ''s'' ∈ ''S''
subject to certain rules that mimic the cancellation familiar from rational numbers. Indeed, in this language '''Q''' is the localization of '''Z''' at all nonzero integers. This construction works for any integral domain ''R'' instead of '''Z'''. The localization (''R'' \ {0})&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''R'' is a field, called the [[quotient field]] of ''R''.

==Ideals and modules==
{{hatnote|In the following, R denotes a commutative ring.}}

Many of the following notions also exist for not necessarily commutative rings, but the definitions and properties are usually more complicated. For example, all ideals in a commutative ring are automatically [[two-sided ideal|two-sided]], which simplifies the situation considerably.

===Modules and ideals===
{{Main|Module (mathematics)|l1=Module}}
For a ring ''R'', an ''R''-''module'' ''M'' is like what a vector space is to a field. That is, elements in a module can be added; they can be multiplied by elements of ''R'' subject to the same axioms as for a vector space. The study of modules is significantly more involved than the one of vector spaces in [[linear algebra]], since several features of vector spaces fail for modules in general: modules need not be [[free module|free]], i.e., of the form
:&lt;math&gt;M= \bigoplus_{i \in I} R.&lt;/math&gt;
Even for free modules, the [[rank of a free module]] (i.e. the analog of the dimension of vector spaces) may not be well-defined. Finally, submodules of finitely generated modules need not be finitely generated (unless ''R'' is Noetherian, see [[#submodules of f g modules|below]]).

===Ideals===
{{Main|Ideal (ring theory)|l1=Ideal|Factor ring}}
''Ideals'' of a ring ''R'' are the [[submodule]]s of ''R'', i.e., the modules contained in ''R''. In more detail, an ideal ''I'' is a non-empty subset of ''R'' such that for all ''r'' in ''R'', ''i'' and ''j'' in ''I'', both ''ri'' and ''i'' + ''j'' are in ''I''. For various applications, understanding the ideals of a ring is of particular importance, but often one proceeds by studying modules in general.

Any ring has two ideals, namely the [[0 (number)|zero ideal]] {0} and ''R'', the whole ring. These two ideals are the only ones precisely if ''R'' is a field. Given any subset ''F'' = {''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''j'' ∈ ''J''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''R'' (where ''J'' is some index set), the ideal ''generated by F'' is the smallest ideal that contains ''F''. Equivalently, it is given by finite [[linear combination]]s
:''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Principal ideal domains====
If ''F'' consists of a single element ''r'', the ideal generated by ''F'' consists of the multiples of ''r'', i.e., the elements of the form ''rs'' for arbitrary elements ''s''. Such an ideal is called a [[principal ideal]]. If every ideal is a principal ideal, ''R'' is called a [[principal ideal ring]]; two important cases are '''Z''' and ''k''[''X''], the polynomial ring over a field ''k''. These two are in addition domains, so they are called [[principal ideal domain]]s.

Unlike for general rings, for a principal ideal domain, the properties of individual elements are strongly tied to the properties of the ring as a whole. For example, any principal ideal domain ''R'' is a [[unique factorization domain]] (UFD) which means that any element is a product of irreducible elements, in a (up to reordering of factors) unique way. Here, an element ''a'' in a domain is called [[irreducible element|irreducible]] if the only way of expressing it as a product
:''a'' = ''bc'',
is by either ''b'' or ''c'' being a unit. An example, important in [[Field (mathematics)|field theory]], are [[irreducible polynomial]]s, i.e., irreducible elements in ''k''[''X''], for a field ''k''. The fact that '''Z''' is a UFD can be stated more elementarily by saying that any natural number can be uniquely decomposed as product of powers of prime numbers. It is also known as the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].

An element ''a'' is a [[prime element]] if whenever ''a'' divides a product ''bc'', ''a'' divides ''b'' or ''c''. In a domain, being prime implies being irreducible. The converse is true in a unique factorization domain, but false in general.

====The factor ring====
The definition of ideals is such that "dividing" ''I'' "out" gives another ring, the ''factor ring'' ''R'' / ''I'': it is the set of [[coset]]s of ''I'' together with the operations
:(''a'' + ''I'') + (''b'' + ''I'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + I and (''a'' + ''I'')(''b'' + ''I'') = ''ab'' + ''I''.
For example, the ring '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' (also denoted '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''n'' is an integer, is the ring of integers modulo ''n''. It is the basis of [[modular arithmetic]].

An ideal is ''proper'' if it is strictly smaller than the whole ring. An ideal that is not strictly contained in any proper ideal is called [[maximal ideal|maximal]]. &lt;cite id=characterisation_of_maximal_ideals&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; An ideal ''m'' is maximal [[if and only if]] ''R'' / ''m'' is a field. &lt;cite id=existence_of_maximal_ideals&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; Except for the [[zero ring]], any ring (with identity) possesses at least one maximal ideal; this follows from [[Zorn's lemma]].

===Noetherian rings===
{{Main|Noetherian ring}}
A ring is called ''Noetherian'' (in honor of [[Emmy Noether]], who developed this concept) if every [[ascending chain condition|ascending chain of ideals]]
:0 ⊆ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  ... ⊆ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ...
becomes stationary, i.e. becomes constant beyond some index ''n''. Equivalently, any ideal is generated by finitely many elements, or, yet equivalent, &lt;cite id=submodules_of_f_g_modules&gt;[[submodule]]s of finitely generated modules are finitely generated&lt;/cite&gt;.

Being Noetherian is a highly important finiteness condition, and the condition is preserved under many operations that occur frequently in geometry. For example, if ''R'' is Noetherian, then so is the polynomial ring {{nowrap|''R''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} (by [[Hilbert's basis theorem]]), any localization ''S''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''R'', and also any factor ring ''R'' / ''I''.

Any non-noetherian ring ''R'' is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of its Noetherian subrings. This fact, known as [[Noetherian approximation]], allows the extension of certain theorems to non-Noetherian rings.

===Artinian rings===
A ring is called [[Artinian ring|Artinian]] (after [[Emil Artin]]), if every descending chain of ideals
:''R'' ⊇ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ⊇ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  ... ⊇ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊇ ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊇ ...
becomes stationary eventually. Despite the two conditions appearing symmetric, Noetherian rings are much more general than Artinian rings. For example, '''Z''' is Noetherian, since every ideal can be generated by one element, but is not Artinian, as the chain
:'''Z''' ⊋ 2'''Z''' ⊋ 4'''Z''' ⊋ 8'''Z''' ⊋ ...
shows. In fact, by the [[Hopkins–Levitzki theorem]], every Artinian ring is Noetherian. More precisely, Artinian rings can be characterized as the Noetherian rings whose Krull dimension is zero.

==The spectrum of a commutative ring==

===Prime ideals===
{{Main|Prime ideal}}
As was mentioned above, '''Z''' is a [[unique factorization domain]]. This is not true for more general rings, as algebraists realized in the 19th century. For example, in
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z[\sqrt{-5}],&lt;/math&gt;
there are two genuinely distinct ways of writing 6 as a product:
:&lt;math&gt;6 = 2 \cdot 3 = (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5}).&lt;/math&gt;
Prime ideals, as opposed to prime elements, provide a way to circumvent this problem. A prime ideal is a proper (i.e., strictly contained in ''R'') ideal ''p'' such that, whenever the product ''ab'' of any two ring elements ''a'' and ''b'' is in ''p'', at least one of the two elements is already in ''p''. (The opposite conclusion holds for any ideal, by definition). Thus, if a prime ideal is principal, it is equivalently generated by a prime element. However, in rings such as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt;, prime ideals need not be principal. This limits the usage of prime elements in ring theory. A cornerstone of algebraic number theory is, however, the fact that in any [[Dedekind ring]] (which includes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z[\sqrt{-5}]&lt;/math&gt; and more generally the [[algebraic integers|ring of integers in a number field]]) any ideal (such as the one generated by 6) decomposes uniquely as a product of prime ideals.

Any maximal ideal is a prime ideal or, more briefly, is prime. Moreover, an ideal ''I'' is prime if and only if the factor ring ''R'' / ''I'' is an integral domain. Proving that an ideal is prime, or equivalently that a ring has no zero-divisors can be very difficult. Yet another way of expressing the same is to say that the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] ''R'' \ ''p'' is multiplicatively closed. The localisation (''R'' \ ''p'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''R'' is important enough to have its own notation: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. This ring has only one maximal ideal, namely ''pR''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. Such rings are called [[local ring|local]].

===The spectrum===
{{Main|Spectrum of a ring}}
[[Image:Spec Z.png|right|400px|thumb|Spec ('''Z''') contains a point for the zero ideal. The closure of this point is the entire space. The remaining points are the ones corresponding to ideals (''p''), where ''p'' is a prime number. These points are closed.]]
The ''spectrum of a ring R'',&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This notion can be related to the [[Spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of a linear operator, see [[Spectrum of a C*-algebra]] and [[Gelfand representation]].&lt;/ref&gt;  denoted by Spec ''R'', is the set of all prime ideals of ''R''. It is equipped with a topology, the [[Zariski topology]], which reflects the algebraic properties of ''R'': a basis of open subsets is given by
:''D''(''f'') = {''p'' ∈ ''Spec R'', ''f'' ∉ ''p''}, where ''f'' is any ring element.
Interpreting ''f'' as a function that takes the value ''f'' mod ''p'' (i.e., the image of ''f'' in the residue field ''R''/''p''), this subset is the locus where ''f'' is non-zero. The spectrum also makes precise the intuition that localisation and factor rings are complementary: the natural maps ''R'' → ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''R'' → ''R'' / ''fR'' correspond, after endowing the spectra of the rings in question with their Zariski topology, to complementary [[open immersion|open]] and [[closed immersion]]s respectively. Even for basic rings, such as illustrated for ''R'' = '''Z''' at the right, the Zariski topology is quite different from the one on the set of real numbers.

The spectrum contains the set of maximal ideals, which is occasionally denoted mSpec (''R''). For an [[algebraically closed field]] ''k'', mSpec (k[''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] / (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;)) is in bijection with the set
:{''x'' =(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∊ ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; | ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ... = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = 0.}
Thus, maximal ideals reflect the geometric properties of solution sets of polynomials, which is an initial motivation for the study of commutative rings. However, the consideration of non-maximal ideals as part of the geometric properties of a ring is useful for several reasons. For example, the minimal prime ideals (i.e., the ones not strictly containing smaller ones) correspond to the [[irreducible component]]s of Spec ''R''. For a Noetherian ring ''R'', Spec ''R'' has only finitely many irreducible components. This is a geometric restatement of [[primary decomposition]], according to which any ideal can be decomposed as a product of finitely many [[primary ideal]]s. This fact is the ultimate generalization of the decomposition into prime ideals in Dedekind rings.

===Affine schemes===
The notion of a spectrum is the common basis of commutative algebra and [[algebraic geometry]]. Algebraic geometry proceeds by endowing Spec ''R'' with a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt; (an entity that collects functions defined locally, i.e. on varying open subsets). The datum of the space and the sheaf is called an [[affine scheme]]. Given an affine scheme, the underlying ring ''R'' can be recovered as the [[global section]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, this one-to-one correspondence between rings and affine schemes is also compatible with ring homomorphisms: any ''f'' : ''R'' → ''S'' gives rise to a [[continuous map]] in the opposite direction
:Spec ''S'' → Spec ''R'', ''q'' ↦ ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''q''), i.e. any prime ideal of ''S'' is mapped to its [[preimage]] under ''f'', which is a prime ideal of ''R''.
The resulting [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] of the two said categories aptly reflects algebraic properties of rings in a geometrical manner.

Similar to the fact that [[manifold (mathematics)|manifolds]] are locally given by open subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, affine schemes are local models for [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], which are the object of study in algebraic geometry. Therefore, several notions concerning commutative rings stem from geometric intuition.

===Dimension===
{{Main|Krull dimension}}
The ''Krull dimension'' (or dimension) dim ''R'' of a ring ''R'' measures the "size" of a ring by, roughly speaking, counting independent elements in ''R''. The dimension of algebras over a field ''k'' can be axiomatized by four properties:
* The dimension is a local property: dim ''R'' = sup&lt;sub&gt;p ∊ Spec ''R''&lt;/sub&gt; dim ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* The dimension is independent of nilpotent elements: if ''I'' ⊆ ''R'' is nilpotent then dim ''R'' = dim ''R'' / ''I''.
* The dimension remains constant under a finite extension: if ''S'' is an ''R''-algebra which is finitely generated as an ''R''-module, then dim ''S'' = dim ''R''.
* The dimension is calibrated by dim ''k''[''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] = ''n''. This axiom is motivated by regarding the polynomial ring in ''n'' variables as an algebraic analogue of [[affine space|''n''-dimensional space]].

The dimension is defined, for any ring ''R'', as the supremum of lengths ''n'' of chains of prime ideals
:''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ⊊ ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊊ ... ⊊ ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
For example, a field is zero-dimensional, since the only prime ideal is the zero ideal. The integers are one-dimensional, since chains are of the form (0) ⊊ (''p''), where ''p'' is a [[prime number]]. For non-Noetherian rings, and also non-local rings, the dimension may be infinite, but Noetherian local rings have finite dimension. Among the four axioms above, the first two are elementary consequences of the definition, whereas the remaining two hinge on important facts in [[commutative algebra]], the [[going-up theorem]] and [[Krull's principal ideal theorem]].

==Ring homomorphisms==
{{Main|Ring homomorphism}}
A ''ring homomorphism'' or, more colloquially, simply a ''map'', is a map ''f'' : ''R'' → ''S'' such that
:''f''(''a'' + ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') + ''f''(''b''), ''f''(''ab'') = ''f''(''a'')''f''(''b'') and ''f''(1) = 1.
These conditions ensure ''f''(0) = 0. Similarly as for other algebraic structures, a ring homomorphism is thus a map that is compatible with the structure of the algebraic objects in question. In such a situation ''S'' is also called an ''R''-algebra, by understanding that ''s'' in ''S'' may be multiplied by some ''r'' of ''R'', by setting
:''r'' · ''s'' := ''f''(''r'') · ''s''.

The ''kernel'' and ''image'' of ''f'' are defined by ker (''f'') = {''r'' ∈ ''R'', ''f''(''r'') = 0} and im (''f'') = ''f''(''R'') = {''f''(''r''), ''r'' ∈ ''R''}. The kernel is an [[ring ideal|ideal]] of ''R'', and the image is a [[subring]] of ''S''.

A ring homomorphism is called an isomorphism if it is bijective. An example of a ring isomorphism, known as the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z/n = \bigoplus_{i=0}^k \mathbf Z/p_i&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a product of pairwise distinct [[prime number]]s.

Commutative rings, together with ring homomorphisms, form a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. The ring '''Z''' is the [[initial object]] in this category, which means that for any commutative ring ''R'', there is a unique ring homomorphism '''Z''' &amp;rarr; ''R''. By means of this map, an integer ''n'' can be regarded as an element of ''R''. For example, the [[binomial formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;(a+b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom n k a^k b^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;
which is valid for any two elements ''a'' and ''b'' in any commutative ring ''R'' is understood in this sense by interpreting the binomial coefficients as elements of ''R'' using this map.

[[File:Tensor product of algebras.png|thumb|The [[universal property]] of ''S'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''T''
 states that for any two maps ''S'' &amp;rarr; ''W'' and ''T'' &amp;rarr; ''W'' which make the outer quadrangle commute, there is a unique map ''S'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''T'' &amp;rarr; ''W'' which makes the entire diagram commute.]]
Given two ''R''-algebras ''S'' and ''T'', their [[tensor product of algebras|tensor product]]
:''S'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''T''
is again a commutative ''R''-algebra. In some cases, the tensor product can serve to find a ''T''-algebra which relates to ''Z'' as ''S'' relates to ''R''. For example,
:''R''[''X''] ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''T'' = ''T''[''X''].

===Finite generation===
An ''R''-algebra ''S'' is called [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated (as an algebra)]] if there are finitely many elements ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; such that any element of ''s'' is expressible as a polynomial in the ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Equivalently, ''S'' is isomorphic to
:''R''[''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] / ''I''.

A much stronger condition is that ''S'' is [[finitely generated module|finitely generated as an ''R''-module]], which means that any ''s'' can be expressed as a ''R''-linear combination of some finite set ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Local rings==
A ring is called [[local ring|local]] if it has only a single maximal ideal, denoted by ''m''. For any (not necessarily local) ring ''R'', the localization
:''R''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;
at a prime ideal ''p'' is local. This localization reflects the geometric properties of Spec ''R'' "around ''p''". Several notions and problems in commutative algebra can be reduced to the case when ''R'' is local, making local rings a particularly deeply studied class of rings. The [[residue field]] of ''R'' is defined as
:''k'' = ''R'' / ''m''.
Any ''R''-module ''M'' yields a ''k''-vector space given by ''M'' / ''mM''. [[Nakayama's lemma]] shows this passage is preserving important information: a finitely generated module ''M'' is zero if and only if ''M'' / ''mM'' is zero.

===Regular local rings===
[[File:Node_(algebraic_geometry).png|thumb|left|The [[cubic plane curve]] (red) defined by the equation ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'' + ''1'') is [[singularity (mathematics)|singular]] at the origin, i.e., the ring ''k''[''x'', ''y''] / ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'' + ''1''), is not a regular ring. The tangent cone (blue) is a union of two lines, which also reflects the singularity.]]
The ''k''-vector space ''m''/''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is an algebraic incarnation of the [[cotangent space]]. Informally, the elements of ''m'' can be thought of as functions which vanish at the point ''p'', whereas ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; contains the ones which vanish with order at least 2. For any Noetherian local ring ''R'', the inequality
:dim&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ''m''/''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ge; dim ''R''
holds true, reflecting the idea that the cotangent (or equivalently the tangent) space has at least the dimension of the space Spec ''R''. If equality holds true in this estimate, ''R'' is called a [[regular local ring]]. A Noetherian local ring is regular if and only if the ring (which is the ring of functions on the [[tangent cone]])
:&lt;math&gt;\bigoplus_n m^n / m^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
is isomorphic to a polynomial ring over ''k''. Broadly speaking, regular local rings are somewhat similar to polynomial rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Matsumura|loc=§7, Remarks, p. 143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular local rings are UFD's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Matsumura|loc=§19, Theorem 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Discrete valuation ring]]s are equipped with a function which assign an integer to any element ''r''. This number, called the valuation of ''r'' can be informally thought of as a zero or pole order of ''r''. Discrete valuation rings are precisely the one-dimensional regular local rings. For example, the ring of germs of holomorphic functions on a [[Riemann surface]] is a discrete valuation ring.

===Complete intersections===
[[File:Twisted_cubic_curve.png|thumb|The [[twisted cubic]] (green) is a set-theoretic complete intersection, but not a complete intersection.]]
By [[Krull's principal ideal theorem]], a foundational result in the [[dimension theory (algebra)|dimension theory of rings]], the dimension of
:''R'' = ''k''[''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;] / (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
is at least ''r'' &amp;minus; ''n''. A ring ''R'' is called a [[complete intersection ring]] if it can be presented in a way that attains this minimal bound. This notion is also mostly studied for local rings. Any regular local ring is a complete intersection ring, but not conversely.

A ring ''R'' is a ''set-theoretic'' complete intersection if the reduced ring associated to ''R'', i.e., the one obtained by dividing out all nilpotent elements, is a complete intersection. As of 2017, it is in general unknown, whether curves in three-dimensional space are set-theoretic complete intersections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lyubeznik|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cohen–Macaulay rings===
The [[depth (ring theory)|depth]] of a local ring ''R'' is the number of elements in some (or, as can be shown, any) maximal regular sequence, i.e., a sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., 
''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''m'' such that all ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are non-zero divisors in
:''R'' / (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;).
For any local Noetherian ring, the inequality
:depth (''R'') &amp;le; dim (''R'')
holds. A local ring in which equality takes place is called a [[Cohen–Macaulay ring]]. Local complete intersection rings, and a fortiori, regular local rings are Cohen–Macaulay, but not conversely. Cohen–Macaulay combine desirable properties of regular rings (such as the property of being [[universally catenary ring]]s, which means that the (co)dimension of primes is well-behaved), but are also more robust under taking quotients than regular local rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Corollary 18.10, Proposition 18.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructing commutative rings==
There are several ways to construct new rings out of given ones. The aim of such constructions is often to improve certain properties of the ring so as to make it more readily understandable. For example, an integral domain that is [[integrally closed]] in its [[field of fractions]] is called [[normal ring|normal]]. This is a desirable property, for example any normal one-dimensional ring is necessarily [[Regular local ring|regular]]. Rendering{{clarify|date=March 2012}} a ring normal is known as ''normalization''.

===Completions===
If ''I'' is an ideal in a commutative ring ''R'', the powers of ''I'' form [[neighborhood (topology)|topological neighborhoods]] of ''0'' which allow ''R'' to be viewed as a [[topological ring]]. This topology is called the [[I-adic topology|''I''-adic topology]]. ''R'' can then be completed with respect to this topology. Formally, the ''I''-adic completion is the [[inverse limit]] of the rings ''R''/''I&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''. For example, if ''k'' is a field, ''k''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the [[formal power series]] ring in one variable over ''k'', is the ''I''-adic completion of ''k''[''X''] where ''I'' is the principal ideal generated by ''X''. This ring serves as an algebraic analogue of the disk. Analogously, the ring of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic integers]] is the completion of '''Z'''  with respect to the principal ideal (''p''). Any ring that is isomorphic to its own completion, is called [[complete ring|complete]].

Complete local rings satisfy [[Hensel's lemma]], which roughly speaking allows extending solutions (of various problems) over the residue field ''k'' to ''R''.

==Homological notions==
Several deeper aspects of commutative rings have been studied using methods from [[homological algebra]]. {{harvtxt|Hochster|2007}} lists some open questions in this area of active research.

===Projective modules and Ext functors===
Projective modules can be defined to be the [[direct summand]]s of free modules. If ''R'' is local, any finitely generated projective module is actually free, which gives content to an analogy between projective modules and [[vector bundle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Serre–Swan theorem]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quillen–Suslin theorem]] asserts that any finitely generated projective module over ''k''[''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] (''k'' a field) is free, but in general these two concepts differ. 
A local Noetherian ring is regular if and only if its [[global dimension]] is finite, say ''n'', which means that any finitely generated ''R''-module has a [[resolution (homological algebra)|resolution]] by projective modules of length at most ''n''.

The proof of this and other related statements relies on the usage of homological methods, such as the
[[Ext functor]]. This functor is the [[derived functor]] of the functor
:Hom&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'', &amp;minus;).
The latter functor is exact if ''M'' is projective, but not otherwise: for a surjective map ''E'' &amp;rarr; ''F'' of ''R''-modules, a map ''M'' &amp;rarr; ''F'' need not extend to a map ''M'' &amp;rarr; ''E''. The higher Ext functors measure the non-exactness of the Hom-functor. The importance of this standard construction in homological algebra stems can be seen from the fact that a local Noetherian ring ''R'' with residue field ''k'' is regular if and only if
:Ext&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''k'', ''k'')
vanishes for all large enough ''n''. Moreover, the dimensions of these Ext-groups, known as [[Betti number]]s, grow polynomially in ''n'' if and only if ''R'' is a [[local complete intersection]] ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Christensen|Striuli|Veliche|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key argument in such considerations is the [[Koszul complex]], which provides an explicit free resolution of the residue field ''k'' of a local ring ''R'' in terms of a regular sequence.

===Flatness===
The [[tensor product]] is another non-exact functor relevant in the context of commutative rings: for a general ''R''-module ''M'', the functor
:''M'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus;
is only right exact. If it is exact, ''M'' is called [[flat module|flat]]. Despite being defined in terms of homological algebra, flatness has profound geometric implications. For example, if an ''R''-algebra ''S'' is flat, the dimensions of the fibers
:''S'' / ''pS'' = ''S'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; ''R'' / ''p''
(for prime ideals ''p'' in ''R'') have the "expected" dimension, namely dim ''S'' &amp;minus; dim ''R'' + dim (''R'' / ''p'').

==Properties==
By [[Wedderburn's little theorem|Wedderburn's theorem]], every finite [[division ring]] is commutative, and therefore a [[finite field]]. Another condition ensuring commutativity of a ring, due to [[Nathan Jacobson|Jacobson]], is the following: for every element ''r'' of ''R'' there exists an integer {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 1}} such that {{nowrap|1=''r''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''r''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Jacobson|year = 1945|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; If, ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''r'' for every ''r'', the ring is called [[Boolean ring]]. More general conditions which guarantee commutativity of a ring are also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Pinter-Lucke|year = 2007|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==

===Graded-commutative rings===
[[File:Pair_of_pants.png|thumb|A [[pair of pants (mathematics)|pair of pants]] is a [[cobordism]] between a circle and two disjoint circles. Cobordism classes, with the [[cartesian product]] as multiplication and [[disjoint union]] as the sum, form the [[cobordism ring]].]]
A [[graded ring]] ''R'' = ⨁&lt;sub&gt;''i''∊'''Z'''&lt;/sub&gt; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is called [[graded-commutative ring|graded-commutative]] if
:''ab'' = (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;deg ''a'' ⋅ deg ''b''.&lt;/sup&gt;
If the ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are connected by differentials ∂ such that an abstract form of the [[product rule]] holds, i.e.,
:∂(''ab'') = ∂(''a'')''b'' + (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;deg ''a''&lt;/sup&gt;∂(''b''),
''R'' is called a [[differential graded algebra|commutative differential graded algebra]] (cdga). An example is the complex of [[differential form]]s on a [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]], with the multiplication given by the [[exterior product]], is a cdga. The cohomology of a cdga is a graded-commutative ring, sometimes referred to as the [[cohomology ring]]. A broad range examples of graded rings arises in this way. For example, the [[Lazard's universal ring|Lazard ring]] is the ring of cobordism classes of complex manifolds.

A graded-commutative ring with respect to a grading  by '''Z'''/2 (as opposed to '''Z''') is called a [[superalgebra]].

A related notion is an [[almost commutative ring]], which means that ''R'' is [[filtration|filtered]] in such a way that the associated graded ring
:gr ''R'' := ⨁ ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' / ⨁ ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;''R''
is commutative. An example is the [[Weyl algebra]] and more general rings of [[differential operator]]s.

===Simplicial commutative rings===
A [[simplicial commutative ring]] is a [[simplicial object]] in the category of commutative rings. They are building blocks for (connective) [[derived algebraic geometry]]. A closely related but more general notion is that of [[E-infinity ring|E&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-ring]].

==Applications==

===Simultaneous diagonalization of matrices===
The ring of [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] is ''not'' commutative, since [[matrix multiplication]] fails to be commutative.&lt;ref&gt;For example,
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 1\\
 0 &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 1\\
 1 &amp; 0\\
\end{bmatrix} &amp;=
\begin{bmatrix}
 2 &amp; 1\\
 1 &amp; 0\\
\end{bmatrix}\\
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 1\\
 1 &amp; 0\\
\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 1\\
 0 &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix} &amp;=
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 2\\
 1 &amp; 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
However, any two matrices ''A'' and ''B'' that do commute can be [[simultaneous diagonalization|simultaneously diagonalized]], i.e., there is an invertible matrix ''P'' such that both ''PAP''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''PBP''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; are diagonal matrices. This fact makes representations of commutative [[Lie group]]s particularly simpler to understand than in general.

An example is the set of matrices of [[divided difference#Matrix form|divided differences]] with respect to a fixed set of nodes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2883">In [[Freudian psychology]], a '''condensation''' ({{lang-de|Verdichtung}}) is when a single idea (an image, memory, or thought) or dream object stands for several associations and ideas.

==In dreams/symptoms/jokes==
[[Freud]] considered that "dreams are brief, meagre and laconic in comparison with the range and wealth of the dream-thoughts." Images and chains of association have their emotional charges [[Displacement (psychology)|displaced]] from the originating ideas to the receiving one, where they merge and "condense" together.&lt;ref&gt;J Childers ed., ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (New York 1995) p. 51-2&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example a dream figure may resemble A, wear B's clothes and act like C, but nevertheless we know somehow that they are 'really' D - rather as with the composite photographs of [[Francis Galton]].&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 205-6&lt;/ref&gt; While condensation could serve the purposes of the dream [[Censorship (psychoanalysis)|censorship]] by disguising thoughts, Freud considered condensation as primarily the preferred mode of functioning of the unconscious [[Superego, ego and id|Id]].&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures of Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud saw the same mechanism of condensation at work in [[Phantasy (psychology)|phantasies]] and neurotic symptoms,&lt;ref&gt;O Fenichel, ''Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in parapraxis and jokes: he often cited as an instance [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]]'s quip about the rich man treating him 'famillionairily'.&lt;ref&gt;P Gay, ''Reading Freud'' (Yale 1990) p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==In metaphor/metonymy==

In the 1950s the concept was used by linguist [[Roman Jakobson]] in his influential article on [[metaphor and metonymy]]. Comparing the linguistic evidence to Freud's account of the dream-work, Jakobson saw symbolism as relating to metaphor, condensation and displacement to metonymy.&lt;ref&gt;E Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Cambridge 2005) p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Jakobson's work encouraged [[Jacques Lacan]] to say that the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] is structured like a language, though he himself linked condensation to metaphor, not metonymy.&lt;ref&gt;J Lacan, ''Ecrits'' (London 1997) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Drunkards_Cloak.jpg|thumb|"The [[Drunkard's cloak|Drunkard's Cloak]]" - an illustration from ''Curious Punishments of Bygone Days'']]

'''''Curious Punishments of Bygone Days''''' is a history book published in 1896.  It was written by [[Alice Morse Earle]] and printed by Herbert S. Stone &amp; Company. Earle was a historian of [[Colonial America]], and she writes in her introduction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ransacking old court records, newspapers, diaries and letters for the historic foundation of the books which I have written on colonial history, I have found and noted much of interest that has not been used or referred to in any of those books. An accumulation of notes on old-time laws, punishments and penalties has evoked this volume.{{fact|date=December 2013}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the title suggests, the subject of the chapters is various archaic [[punishment]]s.  Morse seems to make a distinction between stocks for the feet, in the Stocks chapter, and stocks for the head, described in the Pillory article- which itself clashes with the modern day understanding of a pillory as a whipping post.{{fact|date=December 2013}}

'''Dysteleology''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] view that [[existence]] has no ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' - no [[Four causes|final cause]] from purposeful [[design]]. [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834-1919) invented and popularized the word "dysteleology"&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|title= Natural Selection and Dysteleology|author= [[George Romanes|Romanes, George J.]]|journal= Nature|volume= 9|pages= 361–2|date= 1874-03-12|doi= 10.1038/009361a0 |issue= 228 | quote = 'Prof. Haeckel has invented a new and convenient name, "Dysteleology," for the study of the "purposelessnesses" which are observable in living organisms—such as the multitudinous cases of rudimentary and apparently useless structures.'}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
({{lang-de | Dysteleologie}}&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite OED1 | dysteleology }}
&lt;/ref&gt;).
Dysteleology is an aggressive, yet optimistic, form of science-oriented [[atheism]]{{cn|date=October 2018}} originally perhaps{{or|date=October 2018}} associated with Haeckel and his followers, but now perhaps more associated{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} with the type of atheism of [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], or [[Christopher Hitchens]]. Transcending traditional philosophical and religious perspectives, such as [[German idealism]] (including the philosophies of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]) and contemporary [[New Age]] thinking, [[Modernism|modern]] [[philosophical naturalism]] sees existence as having no inherent goal.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9602">'''Economic abuse''' is a form of [[abuse]] when one intimate partner has control over the other partner's access to economic resources,&lt;ref name ="Adams (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adams |first=Adrienne E. |last2=Sullivan |first2=Cris M. |last3=Bybee |first3=Deborah |last4=Greeson |first4=Megan R. |title=Development of the Scale of Economic Abuse |journal=Violence Against Women |date=May 2008 |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=563–588 |doi=10.1177/1077801208315529 |pmid=18408173}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 Sep 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which diminishes the victim's capacity to support him/herself and forces him/her to depend on the perpetrator financially.&lt;ref name="Adams (2008)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewster (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sanders |first=Cynthia K. |first2=Meg |last2=Schnabel |title=Organizing for Economic Empowerment of Battered Women: Women’s Savings Accounts |work=Center for Social Development, George Warren Brown School of Social Work, Washington University |series=Working Paper No. 04-15 |date=2004 |url=https://csd.wustl.edu/publications/documents/wp04-15.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is related to, or also known as, '''financial abuse,''' which is the illegal or unauthorized use of a person’s property, money, pension book or other valuables (including changing the person's [[will (law)|will]] to name the abuser as heir), often fraudulently obtaining [[power of attorney]], followed by deprivation of money or other property, or by eviction from own home. Financial abuse applies to both [[elder abuse]] and [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carnot|first=Edward J.|title=Is Your Parent in Good Hands?: Protecting Your Aging Parent from Financial Abuse and Neglect|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOFrtWIKrncC&amp;pg=PP1|year=2004|publisher=Capital Books|isbn=978-1-931868-37-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key distinction between economic abuse and financial abuse is that economic abuse also includes the control of someone's present or future earning potential by preventing them from obtaining a job or education.

==Role in domestic violence==
Economic abuse in a domestic situation may involve:
* preventing a spouse from resource acquisition, such as restricting their ability to find employment, maintain or advance their careers, and acquire assets
* preventing the victim from obtaining education
* spend victim's money without his or her consent and creating debt, or completely spend victim's savings to limit available resources
* exploiting economic resources of the victim&lt;ref name="Adams (2008)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewster (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brewster |first=M. P. |title=Power and Control Dynamics in Pre-stalking and Stalking Situations |journal=Journal of Family Violence |year=2003 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=207–217 |doi=10.1023/A:1024064214054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders (2004)"/&gt;

In its extreme (and usual) form, this involves putting the [[Victimisation|victim]] on a strict "allowance", withholding money at will and forcing the victim to beg for the money until the abuser gives the victim some money. It is common for the victim to receive less and less money as the abuse continues. This also includes (but is not limited to) preventing the victim from finishing [[education]] or obtaining [[employment]], or intentionally squandering or misusing communal resources.&lt;ref&gt;"Economic Abuse". BSAFE. September 6, 2009.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controlling mechanism===
Economic abuse is often used as a [[Abusive power and control|controlling mechanism]] as part of a larger pattern of domestic abuse, which may include [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[psychological abuse|emotional]], [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]]. Physical abuse may include threats or attempts to kill the spouse. By restricting the victim's access to economic resources, the offender has limited recourses to exit the abusive or violent relationship.&lt;ref name=wdachoices&gt;[http://wdachoices.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WDAH_flipchart_money_wheel.pdf ''Economic abuse wheel'']. Women's Domestic Abuse Helpline.  Retrieved December 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are ways that abusers may use economic abuse with other forms of domestic violence:
* Using physical force, or threat of violence, to get money.
* Providing money for sexual activity.
* Controlling access to a telephone, vehicle or ability to go shopping; other forms of [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]].
* Threatening to evict the spouse and children from the house without financial support.
* Exploiting the victim's economic disadvantage.
* Destroying or taking resources from the spouse and/or children.
* [[Blaming the victim]] for an inability to manage money; or instigating other forms of economic abuse, such as destruction of property.&lt;ref name=wdachoices/&gt;

[[Victimization]] occurs across all socio-economic levels, and when victims are asked why they stay in abusive relationships, "lack of income" is a common response.&lt;ref name=ncadv&gt;[http://www.ncadv.org/files/EconomicAbuse.pdf ''Economic Abuse.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228000000/http://www.ncadv.org/files/EconomicAbuse.pdf |date=February 28, 2013 }} National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Retrieved November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job-related impacts===
There are several ways that abusers may impact a victim's economic resources.  As mentioned earlier, the abuser may prevent the victim from working or make it very difficult to maintain a job.  They may likewise impede their ability to obtain an education.  Frequent phone calls, surprise visits and other harassing activities interfere with the spouse's work performance. In couples in which the spouse is lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning of their sexuality ([[LGBTQ]]), the abuser may threaten to "out them" with their employer.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

The [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]] in the [[United States]] reports that:
* 25% – 50% of victims of abuse from a partner have lost their job due to domestic violence.
* 35% – 56% of victims of domestic violence are harassed at work by their partners.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

===Impact of lack of economic resources===
By denying the victim access to money, such as forbidding the victim from maintaining a bank account, he or she is totally financially dependent upon the abuser for shelter, food, clothing and other necessities.  In some cases the abuser may withhold those necessities, also including medicine and personal hygiene products. They may also greatly limit their ability to leave the abusive situation by refusing to pay court-ordered spousal or child support.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

Abusers may also use force their spouses to obtain credit and then through negligent activities ruin their credit rating and ability to get credit.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

===Managing economic abuse===
There are several ways to manage economic abuse: ensure one has safe access to important personal and financial records, ensure one's research activities are not traceable and, if you believe you are going to leave the relationship, prepare ahead of time.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

==Role in elder abuse==
{{main article|Elder financial abuse}}

The elderly are sometimes victims of financial abuse from people within their family:
* Money or property is used without their permission or taken from them
* Their signature is forged for financial transactions
* Coerced or influence to sign over deeds, wills or power of attorney
* Deceived into believing that money is exchanged for the promise of lifelong care&lt;ref name=NCPEA&gt;[http://www.preventelderabuse.org/elderabuse/fin_abuse.html ''Financial Abuse.''] National Committee for the Prevention of Elder Abuse (NCPEA). 2008. Retrieved November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Family members engaged in financial abuse of the elderly may include spouses, children, or grandchildren. They may engage in the activity because they feel justified, for instance, they are taking what they might later inherit or have a sense of "entitlement" due to a negative personal relationship with the older person.  Or they may take money or property to prevent other family members from getting the money or for fear that their inheritance may be lost due to cost of treating illnesses. Sometimes, family members take money or property from their elders because of gambling or other financial problems or substance abuse.&lt;ref name=NCPEA/&gt;

It is estimated that there may be 5 million elderly citizens of the United States subject to financial abuse each year.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

==Laws==

===United States===
The Survivors’ Empowerment and Economic Security Act was introduced by the [[110th United States Congress]] to the Senate (S. 1136) and House of Representatives (H.R. 2395) to allow for greater economic freedom for domestic violence victims by providing short-term emergency benefits where needed, guaranteeing employment leave and unemployment compensation, and prohibit insurance restriction or job discrimination to domestic violence victims.&lt;ref name=ncadv/&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Apollo15LunarRover.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]]'s [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]s were battery-driven]]

Electric cars are a variety of [[electric vehicle]] (EV). The term "electric vehicle" refers to any vehicle that uses electric motors for propulsion, while "electric car" generally refers to highway-capable [[automobiles]] powered by electricity. [[Low-speed vehicle|Low-speed]] electric vehicles, classified as [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s (NEVs) in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/rulings/lsv/lsv.html|title=US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards |accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as electric [[motorised quadricycle]]s in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/automotive/files/cit-sum-com-542_en.pdfCitizens' summary EU proposal for a Regulation on L-category vehicles (two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles)]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are plug-in electric-powered [[microcar]]s or [[city car]]s with limitations in terms of weight, power and maximum speed that are allowed to travel on public roads and city streets up to a certain posted speed limit, which varies by country.

While an electric car's power source is not explicitly an on-board battery, electric cars with motors powered by other energy sources are typically referred to by a different name. An electric car carrying [[solar panel]]s to power it is a [[solar car]], and an electric car powered by a gasoline generator is a form of [[hybrid car]]. Thus, an electric car that derives its power from an on-board battery pack is a form of [[battery electric vehicle]] (BEV). Most often, the term "electric car" is used to refer to [[battery electric vehicles]], but may also refer to [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]] (PHEV).

In 1897, electric cars found their first commercial use in the US. Based on the design of the [[Electrobat|Electrobat II]], a fleet of twelve hansom cabs and one brougham were used in New York City as part of a project funded in part by the Electric Storage Battery Company of Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edisontechcenter.org/ElectricCars.html |title=History of Electric Cars |first=Galen |last=Handy |publisher=The Edison Tech Center |location=US |year=2014 |access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, the main manufacturers of electric vehicles in the US were Anthony Electric, Baker, Columbia, Anderson, Edison, Riker, Milburn, [[S.R. Bailey &amp; Co.|Bailey Electric]] and others. Unlike gasoline-powered vehicles, the electric ones were less noisy, and did not require gear changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automobilesreview.com/auto-news/some-facts-about-electric-vehicles/42240/ |title=Some Facts About Electric Vehicles |date=2012-02-25 |access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

Advances in [[internal combustion engine]]s (ICE) in the first decade of the 20th century lessened the relative advantages of the electric car. Their much quicker refueling times, and cheaper production costs, made them more popular. However, a decisive moment was the introduction in 1912 of the electric [[Starter (engine)|starter motor]] which replaced other, often laborious, methods of starting the ICE, such as [[Crank (mechanism)#20th Century|hand-cranking]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the early 1990s, the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions vehicles, with the ultimate goal being a move to [[zero-emissions vehicle]]s such as electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=Daniel |first2=Deborah |last2=Gordon |title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year=2009| pages=22–26 |publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boschert06&gt;{{cite book |first=Sherry |last=Boschert |title=Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America |year=2006 |pages=15–28 |publisher=New Society Publishers| isbn=978-0-86571-571-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, automakers developed electric models, including the [[Chrysler TEVan]], [[Ford Ranger EV]] pickup truck, [[GM EV1]], and [[Chevrolet S10 EV|S10 EV]] pickup, [[Honda EV Plus]] hatchback, Nissan [[Nissan Altra|Altra EV]] miniwagon, and [[Toyota RAV4 EV]]. Both US Electricar and [[Solectria Force|Solectria]] produced 3-phase AC Geo-bodied electric cars with the support of GM, Hughes, and Delco.

[[California]] electric automaker [[Tesla Motors]] began development in 2004 on what would become the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]], which was first delivered to customers in 2008. The Roadster was the first highway legal [[serial production]] all-electric car to use [[lithium-ion battery]] cells, and the first production all-electric car to travel more than {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=in|round=5|order=flip}} per charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://cleantechnica.com/2015/04/26/electric-car-history/ | title=Electric Car Evolution |first=Zachary |last= Shahan |publisher=Clean Technica |date = 2015-04-26| accessdate=2016-09-08}} ''2008: The Tesla Roadster becomes the first production electric vehicle to use lithium-ion battery cells as well as the first production electric vehicle to have a range of over 200 miles on a single charge.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric motors can provide high [[power-to-weight ratio]]s, batteries can be designed to supply the currents needed to support these motors. Electric motors have flat torque curve down to zero speed. For simplicity and reliability, many electric cars use fixed-ratio gearboxes and have no clutch.

Many electric cars have motors that have high acceleration, relative to comparable cars, however, [[Neighborhood Electric Vehicle]]s may have a low acceleration due to their relatively weak motors. This is largely due to the relatively constant torque of an electric motor, which often increase the acceleration relative to a similar [[horsepower|motor power]] internal combustion engine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Electric vehicles can also use a direct motor-to-wheel configuration which increases the available [[power (physics)|power]]. Having motors connected directly to each wheel allows the wheels to be used both for propulsion and as braking systems, thereby increasing [[traction (engineering)|traction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact Wes Siler: Comment Email Facebook Twitter |url=http://jalopnik.com/5515071/raceabout-finlands-first-electric-sports-car |title=Helsinki Metropolia University's RaceAbout |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact Mike Spinelli: Comment |url=http://jalopnik.com/307457/nissan-pivo-2-360-degrees-no-reverse |title=Nissan Pivo 2 |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=2007-10-05 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/plug-in-hybrid-retrofit-kit-ice-vehicle/11631/ |title=Charles Perry's Plug-In Hybrid Retrofit Kit |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; When not fitted with an [[axle]], [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], or [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], electric vehicles have less drive-train inertia.

==Energy efficiency==
{{main|Electric car energy efficiency}}

[[Internal combustion engine]]s have [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic limits]] on efficiency, expressed as fraction of energy used to propel the vehicle compared to energy produced by burning fuel. [[Gasoline engine]]s effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and [[diesel engine]]s can reach on-board efficiency of 20%, while electric vehicles have on-board efficiency of over 90%, when counted against stored chemical energy, or around 80%, when counted against required energy to recharge.&lt;ref name=PEVs2&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|first=Saurin D. |last=Shah|year=2009 |publisher=The Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-0305-1 |edition=1st |chapter=2|pages=29, 37 and 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electric motor]]s are more efficient than internal combustion engines in converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric cars can not idle. [[Regenerative braking]], which is most common in electric vehicles, can recover as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs2/&gt;

Production and [[Electric vehicle conversion|conversion]] electric cars typically use 10 to 23&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.17 to 0.37&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi).&lt;ref name=ev1datasheet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/avta/pdfs/fsev/eva_results/ev1_eva.pdf |format=PDF|year=1999|publisher=United States Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy |accessdate=2009-04-25 |title=Performance Statistics – 1999 General Motors EV1 w/NiMH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |publisher=Idaho National Laboratory |date=2006-05-30 |title=Full Size Electric Vehicles |chapter=Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity |url=http://avt.inel.gov/fsev.html |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webharvest.gov/peth04/20041015210239/http://avt.inel.gov/fsev.html |archivedate=2004-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 20% of this power consumption is due to [[Energy conversion efficiency|inefficiencies]] in charging the batteries. Tesla Motors indicates that the vehicle efficiency (including charging inefficiencies) of their [[lithium-ion battery]] powered vehicle is 12.7&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.21&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi) and the well-to-wheels efficiency (if the electricity is generated from natural gas) is 24.4&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.39&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/efficiency |publisher=Tesla Motors |title=Energy Efficiency of Tesla Electric Vehicles |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabin heating and cooling===
While heating can be provided with an electric resistance heater, higher efficiency and integral cooling can be obtained with a reversible [[heat pump]]. [[Temperature coefficient#Positive temperature coefficient of resistance|PTC junction cooling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |country-code=US |series-number=5889260 |title=Electrical PTC heating device |publication-date=30 March 1999 |editor1-last=Golan|editor1-first=Gad |editor2-last=Galperin|editor2-first=Yuly }}&lt;/ref&gt; is also attractive for its simplicity&amp;nbsp;— this kind of system is used, for example, in the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]].

To avoid using part of the battery's energy for heating and thus reducing the range, some models allow the cabin to be heated while the car is plugged in. For example, the Nissan Leaf, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV and the Tesla Model S can be pre-heated while the vehicle is plugged in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NativeEnergy |url=https://www.recyclebank.com/live-green/3-electric-car-myths-that-will-leave-you-out-in-the-cold |title=3 Electric Car Myths That Will Leave You Out in the Cold |publisher=Recyclebank |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed |last=Piotrowski |url=http://cgdailydrive.com/how-i-survived-the-cold-weather/ |title=How i Survived the Cold Weather |publisher=The Daily Drive – Consumer Guide Automotive |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslarati.com/effects-winter-tesla-battery-range/|title= Effects of Winter on Tesla Battery Range and Regen|work=teslarati.com|date=2014-11-24|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electric cars, for example the [[Citroën Berlingo Electrique]], use an auxiliary heating system (for example [[gasoline]]-fueled units manufactured by Webasto or Eberspächer) but sacrifice "green" and "Zero emissions" credentials. Cabin cooling can be augmented with [[solar power]], or by automatically allowing outside air to flow through the car when parked. Two models of the 2010 Toyota Prius include this feature as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/options.html |title=2010 Options and Packages |work=Toyota Prius |publisher=Toyota |accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
[[File:V10084P006.jpg|thumb|Side impact test of a [[Tesla Model X]]]]

The safety issues of BEVs are largely dealt with by the international standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 6469. This document is divided in three parts dealing with specific issues:

* On-board electrical energy storage, i.e. the battery
* Functional safety means and protection against failures
* Protection of persons against electrical hazards.

In this case the vehicle was being driven at high speed through a roundabout and crashed through a wall and into a tree. The fire broke out several minutes after the driver exited the vehicle.

In the United States, General Motors ran in several cities a training program for [[firefighter]]s and [[certified first responder|first responders]] to demonstrate how to safely disable the [[Chevrolet Volt]]’s powertrain and its 12 volt electrical system.

===Vehicle safety===

===Hazard to pedestrians===
{{See also|Electric vehicle warning sounds}}
At low speeds, electric cars produced less [[roadway noise]] than vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines. Blind or [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] people consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence electric cars and [[hybrid vehicle|hybrids]] could pose an unexpected hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-10-03-2698183585_x.htm|title=Blind people: Hybrid cars pose hazard|publisher=[[USA Today]]|first=Ben|last=Nuckols |date=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist0509"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13606446|title=Electric cars and noise: The sound of silence|publisher=Economist|date=2009-05-07|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests have shown that this is a valid concern, as vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below {{convert|20|mph|-1|abbr=on}}, which affects all road users, not just the visually impaired. At higher speeds, the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise.&lt;ref name="Economist0509"/&gt;

The [[Government of Japan]], the [[U.S. Congress]], and the [[European Parliament]] passed legislation to regulate the minimum level of sound for hybrids and [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s when operating in electric mode, so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching.&lt;ref name="Economist0509"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://detnews.com/article/20110104/AUTO01/101040430/Obama-signs-law-to-require-%E2%80%98quiet%E2%80%99-cars-to-get-noisier|title=Obama signs law to require 'quiet' cars to get noisier|work=[[The Detroit News]]|author=David Shepardson|date=2011-01-04|accessdate=2011-01-05}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TMC0810&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/news/10/08/0824.html|title=TMC to Sell Approaching Vehicle Audible System for 'Prius'|publisher=[[Toyota Motor Company]] News Release|date=2010-08-24|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-363_en.htm|title=Commission welcomes Parliament vote on decreasing vehicle noise |author=European Commission Press Release|publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=2014-04-02|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nissan Leaf]] was the first electric car to use Nissan's [[Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians]] system, which includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse.&lt;ref name=NYT0610B&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/blind-advocates-disappointed-in-nissan-e-v-sounds-for-pedestrians/?ref=automobiles|title=Blind Advocates ‘Disappointed’ in Nissan E.V.

Several anti-noise and electric car advocates have opposed the introduction of artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as such an introduction is based on vehicle type and not actual noise level, a concern regarding ICE vehicles which themselves are becoming quieter.

==Controls==
{{As of|2018}}, most Electric cars have similar driving controls to that of a car with a conventional [[automatic transmission]]. Even though the motor may be permanently connected to the wheels through a fixed-ratio gear and no [[parking pawl]] may be present the modes "P" and "N" are often still provided on the selector. In this case the motor is disabled in "N" and an electrically actuated [[hand brake]] provides the "P" mode.

In some cars the motor will spin slowly to provide a small amount of creep in "D", similar to a traditional automatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Ford-Focus-BeV/245743/ |title=Ford Focus BEV – Road test |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date=|accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the foot is lifted from the accelerator of an [[internal combustion engine|ICE]], [[engine braking]] causes the car to slow. An EV would coast under these conditions, if it wasn't for [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] which instead provides a more familiar response and recharges the battery to an extent. These features also reduce the use of the conventional brakes, significantly reducing wear and tear and maintenance costs as well as improving vehicle range.

==Batteries==
[[File:NASA Lithium Ion Polymer Battery.jpg|thumb|Prototypes of 50 watt-hour/kilogram [[lithium-ion polymer battery]]. Newer lithium-ion cells can provide up to 130&amp;nbsp;W·h/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles]]
{{Main|Electric vehicle battery}}
Lithium-based batteries are often chosen for their high power and energy density, although may wear out over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/how-to/a7432/why-your-gadgets-batteries-degrade-over-time-6705747/|title=Why Your Gadgets' Batteries Degrade|date=2012-04-25|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many [[Electric battery#Solid state batteries|emergring technologies]] trying to combat this issue.

There are also other battery types, such as [[Nickel metal hydride battery|Nickel metal hydride (NiMH)]] batteries which have a poorer power to weight ratio than lithium ion, but are cheaper. Several other battery chemistries are in development such as [[zinc-air battery]] which could be much lighter.

The range of production electric vehicles in 2017 ranged from {{convert|100|km|mi}} ([[Renault Twizy]]) to {{convert|540|km|mi}} ([[Tesla Model S|Tesla Model S 100D]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/01/22/tesla-long-range-electric-car/|title=Tesla Quietly Introduces Longest-Range Electric Car on the Market|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of electric cars are fitted with a display of expected range. This may take into account many factors of how the vehicle is being used, and what the battery is powering. However, since factors can vary over the route, the estimate can vary from the actual achieved range. The display allows the driver to make informed choices about driving speed and whether to stop at a charging point en route. Some [[roadside assistance]] organizations offer charge trucks to recharge electric cars in case of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2016/09/06/aaa-ev-emergency-charging-truck/|title=AAA says that its emergency electric vehicle charging trucks served "thousands" of EVs without power|work=Electrek|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in 2016 stated that 87% of US vehicle-days can be met by current affordable electric cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/16/electric-cars-good-enough-for-90-percent-of-trips.html |title=Electric cars good enough for 90 percent of trips |first=Robert |last=Ferris |work=CNBC |date=2016-08-17 |access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy2016112 |title=Potential for widespread electrification of personal vehicle travel in the United States : Nature Energy |first1=Zachary A. |last1=Needell |first2=James |last2=McNerney |first3=Michael T. |last3=Chang |first4=Jessika E. |last4=Trancik |website=Nature |date=2015-12-31  |doi=10.1038/nenergy.2016.112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charging===
{{main|Charging station}}
Electric cars are typically charged overnight from a charging station installed in the owner's house, or from faster charging stations found in businesses and public areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/01/25/electric-vehicle-car-charging/1059349001/|title=Thinking of buying an electric vehicle? Here's what you need to know about charging|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An overnight charge of 8 hours will only give about a 40 mile charge with a standard 120 volt outlet whereas a 240 volt outlet would give around 180 miles in the same amount of time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/car-charging-time-type-cost#.XACNxGhKiUl|title=Electric Vehicle Charging: Types, Time, Cost and Savings|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2018|work=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within each major region of the world, electric car charging stations are essentially universal across car and charger brands, and simply plugging in a charger into an electric car will charge the car at the fastest rate that car and charger can support.  A notable exception are the [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]] line of cars and charging stations, which use their own proprietary chargers. However, this can be solved by using a converter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2017/01/19/diginow-super-charger-v2-tesla-ev/|title=Diginow Super Charger V2 opens up Tesla destination chargers to other EVs|work=Autoblog|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies have been experimenting with [[battery swapping]] to eliminate delay while charging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.machinedesign.com/automotive/could-battery-swapping-ease-range-anxiety-ev-owners|title=Could Battery Swapping Ease Range Anxiety for EV Owners?|date=2016-07-19|work=Machine Design|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tesla charging station with solar collector trimmed.jpeg|thumb|Panoramic view of [[Tesla supercharger]] rapid charging station in [[Tejon, California|Tejon Ranch, California]] ]]

====Hybrid vehicles====
{{Further|Hybrid vehicle}}[[File:2018 BMW i3 facelift (1).jpg|thumb|The [[BMW i3]] has an optional gasoline-powered [[Range-extended vehicle|range extender]] engine]]

Some electric vehicles have built in generators, these are considered a type of [[hybrid vehicle]].

===Lifespan===
{{Main|rechargeable battery#Lifespan and cycle stability}}

As with all lithium-ion batteries, electric vehicle batteries may degrade over long periods of time, especially if they are frequently overcharged, however, this may take at least several years before being noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2013-04-life-lithium-ion-batteries-electric.html|title=Understanding the life of lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Nissan stated in 2015 that thus far only 0.01 percent of batteries had to be replaced because of failures or problems, and then only because of externally inflicted damage. The vehicles that had already covered more than {{convert|200,000|km|0|abbr=on}}, have no problems with the battery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2015-04/elektroauto-batterie-akku-tesla-s/seite-2 „zeit.de: Batterie-Upgrade? Unwahrscheinlich!“]; retrieved, 22 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extraction ===
Over half of the world's cobalt, a key element in lithium-ion batteries, is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo where the children are forced to mine the cobalt while having little to no protection. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/child-labor-still-rife-in-democratic-republic-of-congo/a-39194724|title=Child labor still rife in Democratic Republic of Congo|last=Cascais|first=Antonio|date=November 6, 2017|website=DW.COM|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future===

;Autonomous park-and-charge

Volkswagen, in collaboration with six partners, is developing an EU research project that is focused on automating the parking and charging of electric vehicles. The objective of this project is to develop a smart car system that allows for autonomous driving in designated areas (e.g. valet parking, park and ride) and can offer advanced driver support in urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ori.ox.ac.uk/older-projects/vcharge/|title=VCharge|work=Oxford Robotics Institute|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla has shown interest in making an arm that automatically charges their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/08/06/teslas-prehensile-car-charger-plugs-itself-in-automatically/|title=Tesla's prehensile car charger plugs itself in automatically|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Other methods of energy storage
Experimental [[electric double-layer capacitor|supercapacitor]]s and [[flywheel energy storage]] devices offer comparable storage capacity, faster charging, and lower volatility.

==Infrastructure==

===Charging station===

[[File:Eletroposto6.jpg|thumb|Charging station at [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. This station is run by [[Petrobras]] and uses [[solar energy]]]]
{{Main|charging station}}

[[Battery electric vehicle|Battery Electric Vehicles]] are most commonly charged from the [[power grid]] overnight at the owner's house, provided they have their own charging station. The electricity on the grid is in turn generated from a variety of sources; such as [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]] and others. Power sources such as [[photovoltaic]] solar cell panels, [[micro hydro]] or [[wind power|wind]] may also be used and are promoted because of concerns regarding [[global warming]].

Charging stations can have a variety of different speeds of charging, with slower charging being more common for houses, and more powerful charging stations on public roads and areas for trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_infrastructure.html|title=Alternative Fuels Data Center: Developing Infrastructure to Charge Plug-In Electric Vehicles|website=www.afdc.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BMW i3]] can charge 0–80% of the battery in under 30 minutes in rapid charging mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charging time for the BMW i3 |url=http://www.bmw.co.uk/en/new-vehicles/bmw-i/i3/2013/charging.html |publisher=BMW |location=UK |accessdate=2013-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921015553/http://www.bmw.co.uk/en/new-vehicles/bmw-i/i3/2013/charging.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The superchargers developed by Tesla Motors provided up to 130&amp;nbsp;kW of charging, allowing a 300-mile charge in about an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cars.com/articles/2013/11/how-quickly-does-the-tesla-model-s-battery-charge/|title=How Quickly does the tesla model S battery charge?|last=Popely|first=Rick|date=November 9, 2013|website=Cars.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Connectors====
Most electric cars have used [[conductive coupling]] to supply electricity for recharging after the [[California Air Resources Board]] settled on the [[SAE J1772]]-2001 standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/charger/uid.pdf |title=Rulemaking:  2001-06-26 Updated and Informative Digest ZEV Infrastructure and Standardization |date=2002-05-13 |work=title 13, California Code of Regulations |publisher=California Air Resources Board |accessdate=2010-05-23|quote=Standardization of Charging Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ARB Amends ZEV Rule: Standardizes Chargers &amp; Addresses Automaker Mergers |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/nr062801.htm |publisher=California Air Resources Board |date=2001-06-28 |accessdate=2010-05-23| quote=the ARB approved the staff proposal to select the conductive charging system used by Ford, Honda and several other manufacturers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the [[European Automobile Manufacturers Association|ACEA]] has decided to use the Type 2 connector from the range of [[IEC 62196#Plug types|IEC_62196 plug types]] for conductive charging of electric vehicles in the European Union, as the Type 1 connector (SAE J1772-2009) does not provide for three-phase charging.&lt;ref name="acea2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100630_Standardisation_e-vehicles.pdf |title=ACEA position and recommendations for the standardization of the charging of electrically chargeable vehicles |publisher=ACEA Brussels |date=2010-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132407/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100630_Standardisation_e-vehicles.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicle-to-grid: uploading and grid buffering===
{{Main|vehicle-to-grid}}

During [[peak load]] periods, when the cost of generation can be very high, electric vehicles could contribute energy to the grid.  These vehicles can then be recharged during [[off-peak]] hours at cheaper rates while helping to absorb excess night time generation. Here the batteries in the vehicles serve as a distributed storage system to buffer power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Mmw large.jpg|300px|thumb|Image from an active millimeter wave body scanner]]
A '''full-body scanner''' is a device that detects objects on a person's body for security screening purposes, without physically removing clothes or making physical contact.  Depending on the technology used, the operator may see an alternate-wavelength image of the person's naked body, or merely a cartoon-like representation of the person with an indicator showing where any suspicious items were detected.  For privacy and security reasons, the display is generally not visible to other passengers, and in some cases is located in a separate room where the operator cannot see the face of the person being screened.  Unlike [[metal detector]]s, full-body scanners can detect non-metal objects, which became an increasing concern after various airliner bombing attempts in the 2000s.

Starting in 2007, full-body scanners started supplementing metal detectors at airports and train stations in many countries.

Three distinct technologies have been used, though the use of Backscatter X-ray has now been discontinued in many countries:
* [[Millimeter wave scanner]]s use non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation similar to that used by wireless data transmitters, in the [[Extremely high frequency|Extremely High Frequency (EHF)]] radio band (which is a lower frequency than visible light). The health risks posed by these machines are still being studied, and the evidence is mixed, though millimeter wave scanners do not generate [[ionizing radiation]]. &lt;ref name="health_privacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://securitymanagement.com/news/companies-seek-full-body-scans-ease-health-privacy-concerns-006852 |work=Security Management |title=Companies Seek Full-Body Scans That Ease Health, Privacy Concerns |author=Harwood, Matthew |date=March 5, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006112416/http://securitymanagement.com/news/companies-seek-full-body-scans-ease-health-privacy-concerns-006852 |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Backscatter X-ray]] machines use low dose penetrating radiation for detecting suspicious metallic and non-metallic objects hidden under clothing or in shoes and in the cavities of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='AMAZING RESULTS' OF THE SCANNER THAT 'SEES EVERYTHING' |url=http://www.domodedovo.ru/en/main/news/publ_press/?ID=1608 |work=Moscow Domodedovo Airport |date=October 2, 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303102333/http://www.domodedovo.ru/en/main/news/publ_press/?ID=1608 |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been considerable debate with regard to how safe this technology is.
* Through-body [[X-Ray]] security scanners that emit a high level of radiation have been supplied by the US to at least two African countries.
Passengers and advocates have objected to images of their naked bodies being displayed to screening agents or recorded by the government. Critics have called the imaging virtual strip searches without probable cause, and have suggested they are illegal and violate basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/10/AR2011031003628.html|title=Group says body scanners an 'unreasonable search'|author=Pickler, Nedra |publisher=The Washington Post|date=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current technology is less intrusive and because of [[privacy]] issues most people are allowed to refuse this scan and opt for a traditional pat-down.

==History (US)==
The first full body security scanner was developed by Dr. Steven W Smith,&lt;ref name="Tek84.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tek84.com/company.html |title=Steven W. Smith / Original Developer of Secure 1000 in 1992 |publisher=Tek84.com |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908095734/http://www.tek84.com/company.html |archivedate=September 8, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, John (January 14, 2010) [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122499686 New Airport Body Scans Don't Detect All Weapons]. National Public Radio&lt;/ref&gt; who developed the Secure 1000 whole body scanner in 1992. He subsequently sold the device and associated patents to [[Rapiscan Systems]], who now manufacture and distribute the device.

The first passive, non-radiating full body screening device was developed by [[Lockheed Martin]] through a sponsorship by the National Institute of Justice ([[NIJ]])'s Office of Science and Technology and the [[United States Air Force Research Laboratory]]. Proof of concept was conducted in 1995 through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]). Rights to this technology were subsequently acquired by [[Brijot|Brijot Imaging Systems]], who further matured a commercial-grade product line and now manufacture, market and support the passive millimeter wave devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brijot Acquires Rights to Lockheed Martin-Developed Technology for Design and Development of Concealed Weapons Detection Camera, Supporting Counter-Terrorism and Homeland Security Efforts |work=Business Wire |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-90526909.html | location=Orlando | date=August 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safety aspects of the Secure 1000 have been investigated in the US by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] since the early 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[Schiphol]] in the [[Netherlands]] was the first [[airport]] in the world to implement this device on a large scale after a test with flight personnel the previous year. On May 15, 2007 two of 17 purchased security scans were installed. 

Full-body scanners was installed in at least one Florida courthouse in 2010&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/05/feds_pervscan/ Feds admit storing pervscanner pics], The Register, August 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and have started to appear in courthouses around the US.&lt;ref&gt;Banda, P.

''Associated Press'' via news.yahoo.com&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one New Jersey [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] train station used full-body scanners during a two-week trial in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudsoncity.net/tubes/securitytesting.html PATH train riders to face anti-terror screening: PATH Trains Hudson Tubes Hudson &amp; Manhattan RR].

Securitysolutions.com (July 14, 2006). Retrieved on November 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 3, 2014, [[Transportation Security Administration]] reported that there were almost 740 Millimeter Wave AIT (Advanced Imaging Technology) &lt;sup&gt;[meaning needed]&lt;/sup&gt; scanners now in use at 160 United States airports &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140903061725/http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/advanced-imaging-technology-ait Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT)]. tsa.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Government also hinted in 2010 at the possibility of deploying the full body scanners at train stations and subways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/now-body-scanners-could-be-deployed-at-us-train-stations-subways-other-mass-transits-news-international-kl0rkpdbgja.html|title='Now 'body scanners' could be deployed at US train stations, subways, other mass transits'|publisher=sify|date=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian government had planned to install full-body scanners at all airport and train stations throughout the country, but announced in September 2010 plans to remove the scanners from airports, calling them "slow and ineffective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/italy-to-abandon-airport-body-scanners-20100924-15pgu.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Italy to abandon airport body scanners | date=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has stated in 2010 they "[have] not, will not and the machines cannot store images of passengers at airports".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.tsa.gov/2010/08/tsa-response-to-feds-admit-storing.html |title=The TSA Blog: TSA Response to “Feds admit storing checkpoint body scan images” |publisher=Blog.tsa.gov |date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the TSA later disclosed, in a response to the house chair on homeland security, that its procurement of airport scanners requires manufacturers to include image storage and transmission features but that these features should be disabled before being placed in an airport. The TSA shows 45 individuals have the ability to turn these machines into 'test mode' which enables recording images, but states that they would never do this on a production system.&lt;ref&gt;Rossides, Gale D. (February 24, 2010) [https://epic.org/privacy/airtravel/backscatter/TSA_Reply_House.pdf Letter to Bennie G. Thompson]. &lt;/ref&gt; The US Marshal Service did operate a backscatter machine in a courthouse which records images. However, in a statement they noted that only individuals involved in a test were recorded. A sample of these images was received and disseminated by Gizmodo in 2010, using a Freedom Of Information Request.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40218074/ns/technology_and_science-security|title=Leaked U.S. Marshal body scan images revealed|author=Rothman, Wilson |publisher=MSN|date=November 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if the US Marshal service has put these new scanning machines, that have recording capabilities, into production.

The analyst is in a different room and is not supposed to be able to see the person being scanned by the Backscatter X-Ray AIT, but is in contact with other officials who can halt the scanned person if anything suspicious shows up on the scan.

In the U.S. TSA currently uses Millimeter Wave AIT scanners exclusively, which show no identifying characteristics of the person being scanned. Instead, a generic outline of a person is used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150503061337/http://www.tsa.gov/ait-how-it-works AIT: How it Works]. U.S. Transportation Security Administration &lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2015, "While passengers may generally decline AIT screening in favor of physical screening, TSA may direct mandatory AIT screening for some passengers as warranted by security considerations in order to safeguard transportation security."&lt;ref name=Vaughan&gt;Vaughan, Jill (December 18, 2015) [https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-tsa-pia-32-d-ait.pdf Privacy Impact Assessment: Update for TSA Advanced Imaging Technology]. U.S. Department of Homeland Security&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] currently allows member states to decide whether to implement full body scanners in their countries:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/aviation-security.56u/ Member States must decide on airport body scanners: EC – EU business news]. EUbusiness.com (June 16, 2010). Retrieved on 2010-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is for each member state to decide to authorise the use of scanners in national airports. That will not change&amp;nbsp;... But where this scanning technology is used it should be covered by EU-wide standards on detection capability as well as common safeguards to ensure compliance with EU health and fundamental rights provisions.|EU Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas}}

In Australia the Government has decided a no opt-out policy will be enforced in relation to screening at airports. Persons with medical or physical conditions that prevent them from undertaking a body scan will be offered alternative screening methods suitable to their circumstances. Infants and young children under 140&amp;nbsp;cm will not be selected to undergo a body scan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160709151224/http://travelsecure.infrastructure.gov.au/bodyscanners/faq.aspx Airport Body Scanners—Frequently Asked Questions].

===Health concerns===
There have been health concerns relating to the use of full body scanning technology, especially the use of x-ray scanners.

====Millimeter wave scanners====
{{Main article|Millimeter wave scanner}}
Currently adopted millimeter wave scanners operate in the millimeter or sub-terahertz band, using [[non-ionizing radiation]], and have no proven adverse health effects, though no long term studies have been done.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com" /&gt; Thomas S. Tenforde, president of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, said in 2010 that millimeter wave scanners are probably within bounds [of standards for safe operation], but there should be an effort to verify that they are safe for frequent use.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes |first=John C. |url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/safety/content/article/113619/1509059 |title=Whole-body airport scanners are basically safe—or are they? |publisher=Diagnosticimaging.com |date=January 8, 2010 |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO (World Health Organization) in 2011 categorized RF (radio frequency) radiation as a possible carcinogen,&lt;ref name=Wall Street Journal,10-3-14.

Numerical simulations of [[terahertz radiation]], which active millimeter wave scanners do not operate at, have produced mixed results. Researchers at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in New Mexico have used simulations to show a way that terahertz radiation may affect DNA
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alexandrov|first1=B.S.|title= DNA Breathing Dynamics in the Presence of a Terahertz Field|journal=Physics Letters A|date=October 29, 2009|volume=374|issue=10|pages=1214|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2009.12.077|pmid=20174451|pmc=2822276|arxiv=0910.5294 |bibcode=2010PhLA..374.1214A}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this has not been verified.

====Backscatter X-ray scanners====
In the United States, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 required that all full-body scanners operated in airports by the [[Transportation Security Administration]] use "Automated Target Recognition" software, which replaces the picture of a nude body with the cartoon-like representation.&lt;ref name="abandons"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/01/tsa-abandons-nude-scanners/|title=TSA Pulls Plug on Airport Nude Body Scanners |date= 2013-01-18| first=David | last=Kravets}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this law, all backscatter X-ray machines formerly in use by the Transportation Security Administration were removed from airports by May 2013, since the agency said the vendor (Rapiscan) did not meet their contractual deadline to implement the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Rapiscan backscatter contract | date=Jan 2013 | publisher=TSA | format= [[World wide Web]] log | url= http://blog.tsa.gov/2013/01/rapiscan-backscatter-contract.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The health effects of the more common millimeter wave scanner are largely unknown, and at least one expert believes a safety study is warranted. "I am very interested in performing a National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements study on the use of millimeter-wave security screening systems," said Thomas S. Tenforde, council president. However, no long-term studies have been done on the health effects of millimeter wave scanners.

Perhaps the most notable and debated professional opinion in regard to the safety of scanners is the so-called "Holdren Letter" from a number of world-renowned biochemists and biophysics researchers from the University of California to the Assistant to the US President for Science and Technology, Dr. John P. Holdren (Co-author of EcoSolutions). The opening paragraph of their letter of concern reads: "We, a number of University of California, San Francisco faculty, are writing—see attached memo—to call your attention to our concerns about the potential serious health risks of the recently adopted whole body back scatter X-ray airport security scanners.

Critics of backscatter x-ray scanners, including the head of the [[Center for Radiological Research]] at [[Columbia University]], say that the radiation emitted by some full-body scanners is as much as 20 times stronger than officially reported and is not safe to use on large numbers of persons because of an increased risk of cancer to children and at-risk populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/7862265/Airport-body-scanners-could-give-you-cancer.html|title=Airport body scanners 'could give you cancer'|author=Bloxham, Andy |publisher=The Telegraph|location=London|date=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/health/Some |title=Some full-body scanners not without cancer risk: Experts |publisher=Canwest News Service |author=Tam, Pauline |date=January 22, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115144315/http://www.canada.com/health/Some+full+body+scanners+without+cancer+risk+Experts/2472370/story.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/292414|date=May 23, 2010 |title=Radiation from airport scanners may increase cancer risk|author=Lindner, Bill |publisher=Digital Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Researchers at the [[University of California, San Francisco]], (UCSF) have argued that the amount of radiation is higher than claimed by the TSA and body scanner manufacturers because the doses were calculated as if distributed throughout the whole body, but the radiation from backscatter x-ray scanners is focused on just the skin and surrounding tissues:&lt;ref name="scribd.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, Scott. (May 18, 2010) [http://www.gadling.com/2010/05/18/scientists-question-safety-of-airport-full-body-scanners/ Scientists question safety of airport full body scanners]. Gadling.com.

Radiology.ucsf.edu (February 14, 2010). Retrieved on 2011-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The majority of [the scanners'] energy is delivered to the skin and the underlying tissue. Thus, while the dose would be safe if it were distributed throughout the volume of the entire body, the dose to the skin may be dangerously high.

The X-ray dose from these devices has often been compared in the media to the cosmic ray exposure inherent to airplane travel or that of a chest X-ray. However, this comparison is very misleading: both the air travel cosmic ray exposure and chest X- rays have much higher X-ray energies and the health consequences are appropriately understood in terms of the whole body volume dose. In contrast, these new airport scanners are largely depositing their energy into the skin and immediately adjacent tissue, and since this is such a small fraction of body weight/vol, possibly by one to two orders of magnitude, the real dose to the skin is now high.

In addition, it appears that real independent safety data do not exist. A search, ultimately finding top FDA radiation physics staff, suggests that the relevant radiation quantity, the Flux [photons per unit area and time (because this is a scanning device)] has not been characterized. Instead an indirect test (Air Kerma) was made that emphasized the whole body exposure value, and thus it appears that the danger is low when compared to cosmic rays during airplane travel and a chest X-ray dose.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However other professors in the UCSF radiology department disagree, saying that the radiation dose is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2010/11/tsa_scanner_controversy_ucsf_r.php|title=TSA Scanners: U.C.

"People who are totally unrelated to radiation wrote it. ... It was senior faculty at UCSF. They're smart people and well-intended, but their conclusions, I think, were off-base. They don't understand how radiation translates to an actual dose in the human body".

Dr. Steve Smith, inventor of the body scanner in 1991, and president of Tek84, one of the companies that produces the machines, has stated that the concerns of Dr. Brenner and UCSF Scientists regarding the skin dose of backscatter scanners are incorrect. He states the values used for X-ray penetration were incorrectly based on the description of the imaging depth which describes what the instrument sees and is a few mm into the skin and the dosage depth which is deeper. He describes experimental proof that the X-rays have the same properties as any other X-Rays and the penetration is correct to be averaged over the whole body. Dr. Smith has provided measured data from an operating body scanner to explain his position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tek84.com/downloads/Holt-Letter2010-12-2.pdf re: Misinformation on airport body scanner radiation safety] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716203604/http://www.tek84.com/downloads/Holt-Letter2010-12-2.pdf |date=July 16, 2011 }}.

Scanners also concentrate the dose in time, because they deliver a high dose-rate at the moment of exposure. High dose-rate exposure has been shown to cause greater damage than the same radiation dose delivered at lower rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0167-8140(86)80181-5|title=Dose-rate effects and the repair of radiation damage|year=1986|last1=Gordonsteel|first1=G|last2=Down|first2=J|last3=Peacock|first3=J|last4=Stephens|first4=T|journal=Radiotherapy and Oncology|volume=5|issue=4|pages=321–31|pmid=3726169}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raises further questions about comparisons to background radiation.

The FDA report states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since general-use x-ray systems emit ionizing radiation, the societal benefit of reliably detecting threats must be sufficient to outweigh the potential radiation risk, if any, to the individual screened. The dose from one screening with a general-use x-ray security screening system is so low that it presents an extremely small risk to any individual. To put the radiation dose received into perspective:
* Naturally occurring ionizing radiation is all around us. We are continuously exposed to this background radiation during ordinary living. In 42 minutes of ordinary living, a person receives more radiation from naturally occurring sources than from screening with any general-use x-ray security system.
* The national radiation safety standard (see below) sets a dose per screening limit for the general-use category. To meet the requirements of the general-use category a full-body x-ray security system must deliver less than the dose a person receives during 4 minutes of airline flight. TSA has set their dose limit to ensure a person receives less radiation from one scan with a TSA general-use x-ray security system than from 2 minutes of airline flight.
* A person would have to be screened more than a thousand times in one year in order to exceed the annual radiation dose limit for people screening that has been set by expert radiation safety organizations (see below).
* Millimeter wave security systems which comply with the limits set in the applicable national non-ionizing radiation safety standard (see below) cause no known adverse health effects.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. David Brenner, head of Columbia University's center for radiological research, said although the danger posed to the individual passenger is "very low", he is urging researchers to carry out more tests on the device to look at the way it affects specific groups who could be more sensitive to radiation. 

Dr. Andrew J. Einstein, director of cardiac CT research at Columbia University, has made the following statements in support of the safety of body scanners:&lt;ref name="businessweek.com" /&gt;: "A passenger would need to be scanned using a backscatter scanner, from both the front and the back, about 200,000 times to receive the amount of radiation equal to one typical CT scan," said Dr. Andrew J. Einstein, director of cardiac CT research at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. "Another way to look at this is that if you were scanned with a backscatter scanner every day of your life, you would still only receive a tenth of the dose of a typical CT scan," he said. "By comparison, the amount of radiation from a backscatter scanner is equivalent to about 10 minutes of natural background radiation in the United States", Einstein said. "I believe that the general public has nothing to worry about in terms of the radiation from airline scanning," he added. "For moms-to-be, no evidence supports an increased risk of miscarriage or fetal abnormalities from these scanners", Einstein added. "A pregnant woman will receive much more radiation from cosmic rays she is exposed to while flying than from passing through a scanner in the airport," he claimed.

In May 2010 the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements issued a press release in response to the health risk claims from UCSF and Columbia University (claims of excessive skin dose and risks to large populations vs. individuals). The NCRP claims that cancer risks cited by opponents are completely inaccurate, stating that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrponline.org/Press_Rel/Commentaries/Comm_16_Press_Release.pdf Structural Shielding Design and Evaluation for Megavoltage Radiotherapy Facilities].

&lt;blockquote&gt; the summation of trivial average risks over very large populations or time periods into a single value produces a distorted image of risk, completely out of perspective with risks accepted every day, both voluntarily and involuntarily.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and that

&lt;blockquote&gt;general-use systems should adhere to an effective dose of 0.1 microsievert (μSv) (0.01 millirem) or less per scan, and can be used mostly without regard to the number of individuals scanned or the number of scans per individual in a year. An effective dose of 0.1 μSv (0.01 mrem) per scan would allow 2,500 scans of an individual annually [i.e., if each scan required 0.1 μSv (0.01 mrem)] without exceeding the administrative control of 0.25 mSv (25 mrem) to a member of the general public for a single source or set of sources under one control. Assuming 250 workdays per year, this would correspond to an average of 10 scans each day, a frequency that is unlikely to be encountered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All the same the [[Inter-Agency Committee on Radiation Safety]] which includes the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[Nuclear Energy Agency]] and the [[World Health Organization]], reported that, "Pregnant women and children should not be subject to scanning, even though the radiation dose from body scanners is 'extremely small'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aoG.YbbvnkzU&amp;pos=11|title=Airport Body Scanning Raises Radiation Exposure, Committee Says|author=Tirone, Jonathan |publisher=Bloomberg|date=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that defects in the machines, damage from normal wear-and-tear, or software errors could focus an intense dose of radiation on just one spot of the body. The researchers write:&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/35498347/UCSF-letter-to-Holdren-concerning-health-risks-of-full-body-scanner-TSA-screenings-4-6-2010 UCSF letter to Holdren concerning health risks of full body scanner TSA screenings 4-6-2010]. Scribd.com. Retrieved on September 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moreover, there are a number of 'red flags' related to the hardware itself. Because this device can scan a human in a few seconds, the X-ray beam is very intense. Any glitch in power at any point in the hardware (or more importantly in software) that stops the device could cause an intense radiation dose to a single spot on the skin. Who will oversee problems with overall dose after repair or software problems? The TSA is already complaining about resolution limitations; who will keep the manufacturers and/or TSA from just raising the dose, an easy way to improve signal-to-noise and get higher resolution? Lastly, given the recent incident (on December 25th), how do we know whether the manufacturer or TSA, seeking higher resolution, will scan the groin area more slowly leading to a much higher total dose?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proponents of backscatter X-ray scanners argue that the [[ANSI N43.17 standard]] addresses safety requirements and engineering design of the systems to prevent the occurrence of accidental high radiation due to defects and errors in hardware and software. Safety requirements include "fail-safe" controls, multiple overlapping interlocks and engineering design to ensure that failure of any systems result in safe or non-operation of the system to reduce the chance of accidental exposures. Furthermore, TSA requires that certification to the ANSI N43.17 standard is performed by a third party and not by the manufacturer themselves.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI N43.17 (2009) section 7.2.1 and 7.2.2&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} But there are cases where types of medical scanning machines, operated by trained medical personnel, have malfunctioned, causing serious injury to patients that were scanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/health/01radiation.html|title=After Stroke Scans, Patients Face Serious Health Risks|author=Bogdanich, Walt |publisher=New York Times|date=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of full-body scanners cite these incidents as examples of how radiation-based scanning machines can overdose people with radiation despite all safety precautions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-stanley/full-body-scanners-from-a_b_694466.html Jay Stanley: Full Body Scanners: From Airports to the Streets?].

In March 2012, scientist and blogger Jonathan Corbett demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the machines by publishing a viral video showing how he was able to get a metal box through backscatter x-ray and millimeter wave scanners in two US airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com/2012/03/06/1b-of-nude-body-scanners-made-worthless-by-blog-how-anyone-can-get-anything-past-the-tsas-nude-body-scanners/ |title=$1B of TSA Nude Body Scanners Made Worthless By Blog – How Anyone Can Get Anything Past The Scanners |publisher=Tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com |date=March 6, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moscaritolo |first=Angela |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2401276,00.asp |title=Blogger Says TSA's Full-Body Scanners Can be Easily Duped |publisher=Pcmag.com |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, Corbett released a second video interviewing a TSA screener, who described firearms and simulated explosives passing through the scanners during internal testing and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/tsa-admits-1b-nude-body-scanner-fleet-worthless/ |title=TSA Admits $1B Nude Body Scanner Fleet Worthless! |publisher=Tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com |date=April 10, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another test of the full-body scanners, the machines failed to detect bomb parts hidden around a person's body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/01/german_tv_on_th.html Schneier on Security: German TV on the Failure of Full-Body Scanners]. Schneier.com. Retrieved on September 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; And in a different test in 2011, an undercover TSA agent was able to carry a handgun through full body scanners multiple times without the weapon being detected. However, fault was not that of the machine, but the TSA Agent who was in charge of viewing the scanned images was simply not paying attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local-beat/TSA-Agent-Slips-Through-DFW-Body-Scanner-With-a-Gun-116497568.html|title=TSA Source: Armed Agent Slips Past DFW Body Scanner|author=Stinchfield, Grant |date=February 21, 2011|publisher=NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore an Israeli airport security expert Rafi Sela, who helped design security at [[Ben Gurion International Airport]], has said: "I don't know why everybody is running to buy these expensive and useless machines. I can overcome the body scanners with enough explosives to bring down a Boeing 747... That's why we haven't put them in our airport."&lt;ref&gt;Levi Julian, Hana (25 April, 2010) [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/137184 Israeli Security Expert to Canada: 'Full Body Scanners Useless']. israelnationalnews.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australia government has been challenged over the effectiveness and cost of full body scanners by public media to which Australian Transport Minister [[Anthony Albanese]] has said he "makes no apologies" for mandating the installation of full body scanners at Australian airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/security-a-safe-market-20111108-1n5hi.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Security a safe market}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US Public opinion===
A Gallup poll given just after the [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253|2009 Christmas Day bombing attempt]] suggested that 78% of American airline travelers approved of body scanners while 20% disapproved. 51% indicated that they would have some level of discomfort with full-body scans, while 48% said they would not be uncomfortable with the idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/125018/Air-Travelers-Body-Scans-Stride.aspx In U.S., Air Travelers Take Body Scans in Stride]. Gallup.com. Retrieved on September 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The poll was given in the context of the 2009 Christmas Day bombing attempt, and some opponents of full body scanners say that the explosives used in that bombing attempt would not have been detected by full-body scanners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/are-planned-airport-scanners-just-a-scam-1856175.html Are planned airport scanners just a scam?&amp;nbsp;– Home News, UK].

An ABC/Washington Post poll conducted by Langer Associates and released November 22, 2010 found that 64 percent of Americans favored the full-body X-ray scanners, but that 50 percent think the "enhanced" pat-downs go too far; 37 percent felt so strongly. In addition the poll states opposition is lowest amongst those who fly less than once a year.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Nate (November 22, 2010) [http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/new-poll-suggests-shift-in-public-views-on-t-s-a-procedures/ New Poll Suggests Shift in Public Views on T.S.A.

As of November 23, 2010 an online poll of 11,817 people on [[The Consumerist]] website, 59.41% said they would not fly as a result of the new scans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumerist.com/2010/11/you-might-be-in-serious-for-refusing-to-be-tsa-screened.html |title= You Might be in serious trouble for refusing to be screened |publisher=Consumerist.com |date= |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, as of November 23, 2010 a poll of [[MSNBC]] 8,500 online readers indicated 84.1% believe the new procedures would not increase travel safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.newsvine.com/_question/2010/11/17/5482236-do-you-support-the-tsas-enhanced-security-procedures?pc=20&amp;sp=2 |title=Do you support the TSA's Enhanced Security Procedures |publisher=MSNBC.com |date= |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a CBS telephone poll of 1,137 people published in November 2010, 81% (+/- 5%) percent of those polled approved TSA's use of full-body scans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/11/15/politics/main7057902.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody | work=CBS News | title=CBS News Poll: 11/15/10 | date=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some debate about the safety of the scanners, however, the TSA argue that mmw scanners used emit no ionizing radiation.&lt;ref&gt;Poynton, Aaron Sean (May 4, 2011).

===TSA's expansion of scanning program===

Forbes magazine reported, in March 2011, that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2011/03/02/docs-reveal-tsa-plan-to-body-scan-pedestrians-train-passengers|title=Documents Reveal TSA Research Proposal To Body-Scan Pedestrians, Train Passengers|author=Greenberg, Andy |date=March 2, 2011|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2011/03/09/tsa-never-tested-full-body-scans-for-mass-transit-except-when-it-did|title=TSA Never Tested Full-Body Scans For Mass Transit, Except When It Did|author=Greenberg, Andy |publisher=Forbes|date=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Newly uncovered documents show that as early as 2006, the Department of Homeland Security has been planning pilot programs to deploy mobile scanning units that can be set up at public events and in train stations, along with mobile x-ray vans capable of scanning pedestrians on city streets.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and that the TSA had research proposals to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;bring full-body scanners to train stations, mass transit, and public events. Contracts included in the EPIC release showed plans to develop long-range scans that could assess what a subject carried from 30 feet away, along with studies that involved systems for x-ray scanners mounted in vans and "covert" scans of pedestrians.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="No nudity" full-body scanner===
The new software for scanners has been applied by US Aviation Security, so the new full-body scanner will not give image of nudity of the person who is scanned to the operators of the scanner, but only give the image as a generic male or female figure with no features. Opponents of full body scanners still consider this to be an unconstitutional strip search, because even though the operators see an edited version of the image, a naked image is still captured by the machine, and there is no guarantee that the Government or private companies won't store the images in the case that a terrorist attack were successful.

This type of software has been applied at Washington, Atlanta and Las Vegas airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halsey |first=Ashley |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/travel/2015670654_nudescanners21.html |title=New airport software to end naked scanner images |publisher=Seattletimes.com |date= |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Our top priority is the safety of the traveling public, and TSA constantly strives to explore and implement new technologies that enhance security and strengthen privacy protections for the traveling public," TSA Administrator John Pistole stated. "This software upgrade enables us to continue providing a high level of security through advanced imaging technology screening, while improving the passenger experience at checkpoints." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hachman|first=Mark|title=No more 'naked' full body airport scans after TSA upgrade|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388855,00.asp|publisher=PCMAG|accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical countermeasures==
Some people wish to prevent either the loss of privacy or the possibility of health problems or genetic damage that might be associated with being subjected to a backscatter X-ray scan. One company sells X-ray absorbing underwear which is said to have X-ray absorption equivalent to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm of lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockyflatsgear.com/ |title=Rocky Flats Gear X-ray protection |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901143535/http://www.rockyflatsgear.com/ |archivedate=September 1, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another product, Flying Pasties, is "...&amp;nbsp;designed to obscure the most private parts of the human body when entering full body airport scanners", but its description does not seem to claim any protection from the X-ray beam penetrating the body of the person being scanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingpasties.com/ |title=Flying Pasties |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601134012/http://flyingpasties.com/ |archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Emotion}}

'''Guilt''' is a [[cognitive]] or an [[emotion]]al experience that occurs when a person [[belief|believes]] or [[understanding|realizes]]—accurately or not—that they have compromised their own standards of conduct or have violated a universal [[Morality|moral]] standard and bear significant [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for that violation.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare: {{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/gale-psychology-encyclopedia/guilt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502063427/http://www.enotes.com/gale-psychology-encyclopedia/guilt |archivedate=2 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }} "In psychology, what is "guilt," and what are the stages of guilt development?". eNotes.com. 2006. 31 December 2007: 'Let's begin with a working definition of guilt. Guilt is “an emotional state produced by thoughts that we have not lived up to our ideal self and could have done otherwise.”' Retrieved 2017-12-03.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Guilt is closely related to the concept of [[remorse]].

==Psychology==
Guilt is an important factor in perpetuating [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Leslie J. Shapiro, LICSW |url=https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |title=Pathological guilt: A persistent yet overlooked treatment factor in obsessive-compulsive disorder — |publisher=Aacp.com |accessdate=27 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201040951/https://www.aacp.com/Abstract.asp?AID=9322&amp;issue=February%202011&amp;page=C&amp;UID= |archivedate=1 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt and its associated causes, merits, and demerits are common themes in [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]]. Both in specialized and in ordinary language, guilt is an affective state in which one experiences conflict at having done something that one believes one should not have done (or conversely, having not done something one believes one should have done). It gives rise to a feeling which does not go away easily, driven by '[[conscience]]'. [[Sigmund Freud]] described this as the result of a struggle between the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and the [[superego]]&amp;nbsp;– parental imprinting. Freud rejected the role of [[God]] as punisher in times of illness or rewarder in time of wellness. While removing one source of guilt from patients, he described another. This was the unconscious force within the individual that contributed to illness, Freud in fact coming to consider "the obstacle of an unconscious sense of guilt...as the most powerful of all obstacles to recovery."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) pp. 390–1&lt;/ref&gt; For his later explicator, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], guilt was the inevitable companion of the signifying subject who acknowledged normality in the form of [[the Symbolic]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Belsey]], ''Shakespeare in Theory and Practice'' (2008) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] claims that "many people suffer all their lives from this oppressive feeling of guilt, the sense of not having lived up to their parents' expectations....no argument can overcome these guilt feelings, for they have their beginnings in life's earliest period, and from that they derive their intensity."&lt;ref&gt;Alice Miller, ''The Drama of Being a Child'' (1995) pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; This may be linked to what Les Parrott has called "the disease of false guilt....At the root of false guilt is the idea that what you ''feel'' must be true."&lt;ref&gt;Parrott, pp. 158–9&lt;/ref&gt; If you ''feel'' guilty, you must ''be'' guilty!

The philosopher [[Martin Buber]] underlined the difference between the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] notion of guilt, based on internal conflicts, and ''existential guilt'', based on actual harm done to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buber, M. |title=Guilt and guilt feelings |journal=Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=114–29 |date=May 1957 |pmid=13441838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is often associated with [[anxiety]]. In [[mania]], according to [[Otto Fenichel]], the patient succeeds in applying to guilt "the defense mechanism of denial by overcompensation...re-enacts being a person without guilt feelings."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) pp. 409–10&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychological research, guilt can be measured by using questionnaires, such as the [[Discrete emotion theory|Differential Emotions Scale]] (Izard's DES), or the [[Dutch Guilt Measurement Instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Van Laarhoven, H et al. | title=Comparison of attitudes of guilt and forgiveness in cancer patients without evidence of disease and advanced cancer patients in a palliative care setting |journal=Cancer Nursing |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=483-492 |date=November–December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defenses===
Defenses against feeling guilt can become an overriding aspect of one's personality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]] ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;  The methods that can be used to avoid guilt are multiple.  They include:
#[[Psychological repression|Repression]], usually used by the [[superego]] and ego against instinctive impulses, but on occasion employed against the superego/conscience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11)p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;  If the defence fails, then (in a return of the repressed) one may begin to feel guilty years later for actions lightly committed at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1976) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Psychological projection|Projection]] is another defensive tool with wide applications. It may take the form of [[blaming the victim]]: The victim of someone else's accident or bad luck may be offered criticism, the theory being that the victim may be at fault for having attracted the other person's hostility.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pursuit of Health'', June Bingham &amp; Norman Tamarkin, M.D., Walker Press&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, not the guilt, but the condemning agency itself, may be projected onto other people, in the hope that they will look upon one's deeds more favorably than one's own conscience  (a process that verges on [[Ideas of reference and delusions of reference|ideas of reference]]).&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 165 and p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;
#Sharing a feeling of guilt, and thereby being less alone with it, is a motive force in both art and joke-telling; while it is also possible to "borrow" a sense of guilt from someone who is seen as in the wrong, and thereby assuage one's own.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 165-6 and p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;
#Self-harm may be used as an alternative to compensating the object of one's transgression – perhaps in the form of not allowing oneself to enjoy opportunities open to one, or benefits due, as a result of uncompensated guilt feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelissen | first1 = R.

=== Behavioral responses ===
Feelings of guilt can prompt subsequent virtuous behavior. People who feel guilty may be more likely to exercise restraint,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guilty pleasures and grim necessities: Affective attitudes in dilemmas of self-control.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/80/2/206/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-10-13|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; avoid self-indulgence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The effects of nonconsciously priming emotion concepts on behavior.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/93/6/927/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-10-13|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibit less prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Dynamic Model of Guilt Implications for Motivation and Self-Regulation in the Context of Prejudice|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/6/524|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2007-06-01|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 17576266|pages = 524–530|volume = 18|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01933.x|language = en|first = David M.|last = Amodio|first2 = Patricia G.|last2 = Devine|first3 = Eddie|last3 = Harmon-Jones|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161205085614/http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/6/524|archivedate = 5 December 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt appears to prompt reparatory behaviors to alleviate the negative emotions that it engenders.

===Lack of guilt in psychopaths===
Individuals high in [[psychopathy]] lack any true sense of guilt or [[remorse]] for harm they may have caused others. Instead, they [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalize]] their behavior, [[blame]] someone else, or [[Denial|deny]] it outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Birket-Smith, Morten |author2=Millon, Theodore |author3=Simonsen, Erik |author4=Davis, Roger E. |chapter=11.

They have little ability to plan ahead for the future. An individual with psychopathy will never find themselves at fault because they will do whatever it takes to benefit themselves without reservation. A person that does not feel guilt or remorse would have no reason to find themselves at fault for something that they did with the intention of hurting another person. To a person high in psychopathy, their actions can always be rationalized to be the fault of another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neumann |first=Craig S. |author2=Kosson, David S. |author3=Forth, Adelle E. |author4=Hare, Robert D. |title=Factor structure of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV) in adolescent females|journal=Psychological Assessment|year=2013|doi=10.1037/1040-3590.18.2.142 |volume=18 |pages=142–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by psychologists as part of a lack of moral reasoning (in comparison with the majority of humans), an inability to evaluate situations in a moral framework, and an inability to develop emotional bonds with other people due to a lack of [[empathy]].

===Causes===

====Evolutionary theories====
Some evolutionary psychologists theorize that guilt and [[shame]] helped maintain beneficial relationships, such as [[reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pallanti, S., Quercioli, L. |title=Shame and psychopathology |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=28–43 |date=August 2000 |pmid=18192938}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person feels guilty when he harms another, or even fails to reciprocate kindness, he is more likely not to harm others or become too selfish. In this way, he reduces the chances of retaliation by members of his tribe, and thereby increases his survival prospects, and those of the tribe or group. As with any other emotion, guilt can be [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] to control or influence others. As highly social animals living in large, relatively stable groups, humans need ways to deal with conflicts and events in which they inadvertently or purposefully harm others. If someone causes harm to another, and then feels guilt and demonstrates regret and sorrow, the person harmed is likely to forgive. Thus, guilt makes it possible to forgive, and helps hold the social group together.

====Social psychology theories====
When we see another person suffering, it can also cause us pain. This constitutes our powerful system of empathy, which leads to our thinking that we should do something to relieve the suffering of others. If we cannot help another, or fail in our efforts, we experience feelings of guilt. From the perspective of group selection, groups that are made up of a high percentage of co-operators outdo groups with a low percentage of co-operators in between-group competition. People who are more prone to high levels of empathy-based guilt may be likely to suffer from anxiety and depression; however, they are also more likely to cooperate and behave altruistically. This suggests that guilt-proneness may not always be beneficial at the level of the individual, or within-group competition, but highly beneficial in between-group competition.{{Citation needed|reason=cf. Dearing, et al. in Addictive Behaviors Vol 30.7 for conflicting research.|date=December 2008}}

====Other theories====
Another common notion is that guilt is assigned by social processes, such as a [[jury trial]] (i. e., that it is a strictly legal concept). Thus, the ruling of a jury that [[O. J. Simpson]] or [[Julius Rosenberg]] was "guilty" or "not innocent" is taken as an actual judgment by the whole society that they must act as if they were so. By corollary, the ruling that such a person is "not guilty" may not be so taken, due to the asymmetry in the assumption that one is [[Presumption of innocence|assumed innocent until proven guilty]], and prefers to take the [[risk]] of freeing a guilty party over convicting innocents. Still others—often, but not always, theists of one type or another—believe that the origin of guilt comes from violating universal principles of right and wrong. In most instances, people who believe this also acknowledge that even though there is proper guilt from doing 'wrong' instead of doing 'right', people endure all sorts of guilty feelings which do not stem from violating universal moral principles.

==Collective guilt==

{{main|Collective responsibility}}
Collective guilt (or group guilt) is the unpleasant and often emotional reaction that results among a group of individuals when it is perceived that the group illegitimately harmed members of another group. It is often the result of “sharing a social identity with others whose actions represent a threat to the positivity of that identity.” For an individual to experience collective guilt, he must identify himself as a part of the in-group. “This produces a perceptual shift from thinking of oneself in terms of ‘I’ and ‘me’ to ‘us’ or ‘we’.”&lt;ref name="Collective"&gt;{{cite book |last=Branscombe |first=Nyla, R. |author2=Bertjan Doosje |year=2004
|title=Collective Guilt: International Perspectives |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-52083-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-guilt==

Feeling guilt for one's own actions. This doesn't mean that you feel guilty for your own actions all the time, you can feel self-guilt even if someone else did something. Self-guilt can often lead to [[depression (mood)]] and worst-case scenarios.

===Self-guilt in relationships===
While dealing with self-guilt, there's even more stuff you need to deal with. Self-guilt can mentally eat up a person while they're in a relationship, making them feel [[guilt]] on one's ownself. This can occur due to many things, one of them in insecurties. Feeling insecure can lead to self-guilt, feeling like it's one's own fault for feeling that way. This can often feel stressful, causing mental-break downs, problems in the relationship, and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="tinybuddha"&gt;[https://tinybuddha.com/topic/self-guilt-might-ruin-my-relationship-need-to-make-a-solid-change/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Self-guilt &amp; Self-harm===
Self-guilt is a feeling many people who self-harm get. Self-guilt is almost like mentally self-harming to one's ownself, except it's in the mind. People who self-harm often feel it's their fault for doing it, which makes them feel ashamed. Harming yourself is often felt like it's your own fault, giving the feeling of ''self-guilt''. &lt;ref name="self-harm and self-guilt"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/1367493507082759| pmid=18039732|title = Guilt and shame: Experiences of parents of self-harming adolescents| journal=Journal of Child Health Care| volume=11| issue=4| pages=298–310|year = 2007|last1 = McDonald|first1 = Glenda| last2=O'Brien| first2=Louise| last3=Jackson| first3=Debra}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Self-guilt &amp; Depression===
[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is often related to self-guilt. Constant feeling of self-guilt can lead to depression, since an individual is constantly putting themselves down. Self-guilt sparks insecurity, indecision, and poor decisions. &lt;ref name="depression"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/overcoming-guilt-in-depression/ | title=Overcoming Guilt in Depression| date=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural views==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
Traditional [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]], [[Korean society]] and [[Chinese culture]]&lt;ref&gt;Bill Brugger, ''China, Liberation and Transformation'' (1981) pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes said to be "[[shame]]-based" rather than "guilt-based", in that the social consequences of "getting caught" are seen as more important than the individual feelings or experiences of the agent (see the work of [[Ruth Benedict]]). The same has been said of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek society]], a culture where, in [[Bruno Snell]]'s words, if "honour is destroyed the moral existence of the loser collapses."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. I. Finley, ''The World of Odysseus'' (1967) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

This may lead to more of a focus on [[etiquette]] than on [[ethics]] as understood in Western civilization, leading some{{who|date=April 2012}} in Western civilizations to question why the word ''[[ethos]]'' was adapted from [[Ancient Greek]] with such vast differences in cultural norms. [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] inherit most notions of guilt from [[Judaism]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, [[Ancient Persia|Persia]]n, and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ideas, mostly as interpreted through [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who adapted [[Plato]]'s ideas to Christianity. The [[Latin]] word for guilt is ''culpa'', a word sometimes seen in law literature, for instance in ''mea culpa'' meaning "my fault (guilt)".

===Etymology===
Guilt, from [[Old English|O.E.]] ''gylt'' "crime, sin, fault, fine, debt", derived from O.E. ''gieldan'' "to pay for, debt". The mistaken use for "sense of guilt" is first recorded in 1690. "Guilt by association" is first recorded in 1941. "Guilty" is from O.E. ''gyltig'', from ''gylt''.

===In literature===
Guilt is a main theme in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', Tennessee Williams' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]" and "[[The Black Cat (short story)|The Black Cat]]", and many other works of literature. In Sartre's ''[[The Flies]]'', the Furies (in the form of flies) represent the morbid, strangling forces of neurotic guilt which bind us to authoritarian and totalitarian power.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fagles trans., ''The Oresteia'' (Penguin 1981) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilt is a major theme in many works by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and is an almost universal concern of novelists who explore inner [[life]] and [[secret]]s.

===In the Christian Bible===
Guilt in the Christian [[Bible]] is not merely an emotional state but is a legal state of deserving punishment. The [[Hebrew Bible]] does not have a unique word for guilt, but uses a single word to signify: "sin, the guilt of it, the punishment due unto it, and a sacrifice for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Owen, J. |chapter=Chapter 8|title=The Doctrine of Justification by Faith |publisher=Johnstone and Hunter |location=London |year=1850 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek [[New Testament]] uses a word for guilt that means "standing exposed to judgment for sin" (e. g., [[Romans 3]]:19). In what Christians call the "[[Old Testament]]", Christians believe the Bible teaches that, through sacrifice, one's sins can be forgiven (Judaism categorically rejects this idea, holding that forgiveness of sin is exclusively through repentance, and the role of sacrifices was for atonement of sins committed by accident or ignorance [http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/11-08-02.html]). The New Testament says that this forgiveness is given as written in 1 Corinthians 15:3–4: "3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, for that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures." Some believe that the Old and New Testaments have differing opinions on the expiation of guilt because the Old Testaments were subject to the Age of Law and the New Testaments replace the Age of Law with the now current Age of Grace. However, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament salvation was granted based on God's grace and forgiveness (Gen 6:8; 19:19; Exo 33:12–17; 34:6–7). Animal sacrifices were only a symbol of the future sacrifice of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (Heb 10:1–4; 9–12). The whole world is guilty before God for abandoning him and his ways (Rom 3:19). In Jesus Christ, God took upon himself the sins of the world and died on the cross to pay our debt (Rom 6:23). Those who repent and accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for their sins, will be redeemed by God and thus not guilty before him. They will be granted eternal life which will take effect when Jesus comes the second time (1 Thess 4:13–18). In contrast to surrounding nations which addressed their guilt with human sacrifice, the Israeli authors of the Bible called that an abomination (1 Kings 11:7, Jer 32:35). The Bible agrees with pagan cultures that guilt creates a cost that someone must pay (Heb 9:22). (This assumption was expressed in the previous section, "Defences": "Guilty people punish themselves if they have no opportunity to compensate the transgression that caused them to feel guilty. It was found that self-punishment did not occur if people had an opportunity to compensate the victim of their transgression.") But unlike pagan deities who demanded it be paid by humans, God, according to the Bible, loved us enough to pay it Himself, as a good father would, while calling us His "children" and calling Himself our "father" (Mat 5:45).

{{General relativity sidebar |solutions}}

The '''Gödel metric''' is an [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solution]] of the [[Einstein field equations]] in which the [[stress–energy tensor]] contains two terms, the first representing the matter density of a homogeneous distribution of swirling dust particles ([[dust solution]]), and the second associated with a nonzero [[cosmological constant]] (see [[lambdavacuum solution]]). It is also known as the '''Gödel solution''' or '''Gödel universe'''.

This solution has many unusual properties—in particular, the existence of [[closed timelike curve]]s that would allow [[time travel]] in a universe described by the solution. Its definition is somewhat artificial in that the value of the cosmological constant must be carefully chosen to match the density of the dust grains, but this [[spacetime]] is an important pedagogical example.

The solution was found in 1949 by [[Kurt Gödel]].&lt;ref&gt;Gödel, K., [http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.21.447 "An Example of a New Type of Cosmological Solutions of Einstein's Field Equations of Gravitation"], ''[[Rev. Mod. Phys.]]'' '''21''', 447, published July 1, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Like any other [[Pseudo-Riemannian manifold#Lorentzian manifold|Lorentzian spacetime]], the Gödel solution presents the [[metric tensor]] in terms of some local [[coordinate chart]]. It may be easiest to understand the Gödel universe using the cylindrical coordinate system (presented below), but this article uses the chart that Gödel originally used. In this chart, the [[line element]] is
:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = \frac{1}{2\omega^2} \left[ -(dt + e^x dz)^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} e^{2x} dz^2 \right], \qquad -\infty &lt; t, x, y, z &lt; \infty,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a nonzero real constant, which turns out to be the angular velocity of the surrounding dust grains around the ''y'' axis, as measured by a "non-spinning" observer riding one of the dust grains. "Non-spinning" means that it doesn't feel centrifugal forces, but in this coordinate frame it would actually be turning on an axis parallel to the ''y'' axis. As we shall see, the dust grains stay at constant values of ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''. Their density in this coordinate chart increases with ''x'', but their density in their own frames of reference is the same everywhere.

==Properties==
To study the properties of the Gödel solution, we will adopt the [[Frame fields in general relativity|frame field]] (dual to the coframe read off the metric as given above),
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_0 = \sqrt{2} \omega \, \partial_t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_1 = \sqrt{2} \omega \, \partial_x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_2 = \sqrt{2} \omega \, \partial_y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_3 = 2 \omega \, \left( \exp(-x) \, \partial_z - \, \partial_t \right).&lt;/math&gt;
This frame defines a family of inertial observers who are ''comoving with the dust grains''. However, computing the [[Fermi–Walker differentiation|Fermi–Walker derivative]]s with respect to &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_0&lt;/math&gt; shows that the spatial frames are ''spinning'' about &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_2&lt;/math&gt; with angular velocity &lt;math&gt;-\omega&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that the ''nonspinning inertial frame'' comoving with the dust particles is
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{f}_0 = \vec{e}_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{f}_1 = \cos(\omega t) \, \vec{e}_1 - \sin(\omega t) \, \vec{e}_3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{f}_2 = \vec{e}_2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{f}_3 = \sin(\omega t) \, \vec{e}_1 + \cos(\omega t) \, \vec{e}_3.&lt;/math&gt;

===Einstein tensor===
The components of the [[Einstein tensor]] (with respect to either frame above) are
:&lt;math&gt;G^{\hat{a}\hat{b}} = \omega^2 \, \operatorname{diag} (-1,1,1,1) + 2 \omega^2 \, \operatorname{diag} (1,0,0,0).&lt;/math&gt;
Here, the first term is characteristic of a [[lambdavacuum solution]] and the second term is characteristic of a pressureless [[perfect fluid]] or dust solution. Notice that the cosmological constant is carefully chosen to partially cancel the matter density of the dust.

===Topology===
The Gödel spacetime is a rare example of a ''regular'' (singularity-free) solution of the Einstein field equation. Gödel's original chart (given here) is [[Riemannian manifold#Geodesic completeness|geodesically complete]] and singularity free; therefore, it is a global chart, and the spacetime is [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and therefore, simply connected.

===Curvature invariants===
In any Lorentzian spacetime, the fourth-rank [[Riemann tensor]] is a multilinear operator on the four-dimensional space of [[tangent vector]]s (at some event), but a [[linear operator]] on the six-dimensional space of [[bivector]]s at that event. Accordingly, it has a [[characteristic polynomial]], whose roots are the [[eigenvalue]]s. In the Gödel spacetime, these eigenvalues are very simple:
* triple eigenvalue zero,
* double eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;-\omega^2&lt;/math&gt;,
* single eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\omega^2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Killing vectors===
This spacetime admits a five-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] of [[Killing vector]]s, which can be generated by ''[[time translation]]'' &lt;math&gt; \partial_t &lt;/math&gt;, two ''spatial translations'' &lt;math&gt; \partial_y, \; \partial_z&lt;/math&gt;, plus two further Killing vector fields:
:&lt;math&gt; \partial_x - z \, \partial_z &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; -2 \exp(-x) \, \partial_t + z \, \partial_x + \left( \exp(-2x) -z^2/2 \right) \, \partial_z.&lt;/math&gt;
The isometry group acts ''transitively'' (since we can translate in &lt;math&gt;t,y,z&lt;/math&gt;, and using the fourth vector we can move along &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as well), so the spacetime is ''homogeneous''. However, it is not ''isotropic'', as we shall see.

It is obvious from the generators just given that the slices &lt;math&gt;x=x_0&lt;/math&gt; admit a [[transitive group action|transitive]] [[abelian group|abelian]] three-dimensional [[transformation group]], so a quotient of the solution can be reinterpreted as a stationary cylindrically symmetric solution. Less obviously, the slices &lt;math&gt;y=y_0&lt;/math&gt; admit an [[SL2(R)|SL(2,'''R''')]] action, and the slices &lt;math&gt;t=t_0&lt;/math&gt; admit a Bianchi III (c.f. the fourth Killing vector field). We can restate this by saying that our symmetry group includes as three-dimensional subgroups examples of Bianchi types I, III and VIII. Four of the five Killing vectors, as well as the curvature tensor, do not depend upon the coordinate y. Indeed, the Gödel solution is the [[Cartesian product]] of a factor '''R''' with a three-dimensional Lorentzian manifold ([[signature]] -++).

It can be shown that the Gödel solution is, up to [[local isometry]], the ''only'' perfect fluid solution of the Einstein field equation admitting a five-dimensional Lie algebra of Killing vectors.

===Petrov type and Bel decomposition===
The [[Weyl tensor]] of the Gödel solution has [[Petrov type D|Petrov type '''D''']]. This means that for an appropriately chosen observer, the tidal forces have ''[[Coulomb form]]''.

To study the tidal forces in more detail, we compute the [[Bel decomposition]] of the Riemann tensor into three pieces, the tidal or electrogravitic tensor (which represents tidal forces), the magnetogravitic tensor (which represents [[spin-spin force]]s on spinning test particles and other gravitational effects analogous to magnetism), and the topogravitic tensor (which represents the spatial sectional curvatures).

Observers comoving with the dust particles find that the ''tidal tensor'' (with respect to &lt;math&gt;\vec{u} = \vec{e}_0&lt;/math&gt;, which components evaluated in our frame) has the form
:&lt;math&gt;{E\left[ \vec{u} \right]}_{\hat{m}\hat{n}} = \omega^2 \, \operatorname{diag}(1,0,1).&lt;/math&gt;
That is, they measure isotropic tidal tension orthogonal to the distinguished direction &lt;math&gt;\partial_y&lt;/math&gt;.

The gravitomagnetic tensor ''vanishes identically''
:&lt;math&gt;{B\left[ \vec{u} \right]}_{\hat{m}\hat{n}} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This is an artifact of the unusual symmetries of this spacetime, and implies that the putative "rotation" of the dust does not have the gravitomagnetic effects usually associated with the gravitational field produced by rotating matter.

The principal [[Lorentz invariant]]s of the Riemann tensor are
:&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd} \, R^{abcd} = 12 \omega^4, \; R_{abcd} {{}^\star R}^{abcd} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The vanishing of the second invariant means that some observers measure no gravitomagnetism, which is consistent with what was just said. The fact that the first invariant (the [[Kretschmann invariant]]) is constant reflects the homogeneity of the Gödel spacetime.

===Rigid rotation===

The frame fields given above are both ''inertial'', &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\vec{e}_0} \vec{e}_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, but the ''vorticity vector'' of the timelike geodesic congruence defined by the timelike unit vectors is 
:&lt;math&gt;-\omega \vec{e}_2&lt;/math&gt;
This means that the world lines of nearby dust particles are twisting about one another. Furthermore, the ''shear tensor'' of the congruence &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_0&lt;/math&gt; ''vanishes'', so the dust particles exhibit ''rigid rotation''.

===Optical effects===

If we study the past [[light cone]] of a given observer, we find that null geodesics moving orthogonally to &lt;math&gt;\partial_y&lt;/math&gt; ''spiral inwards'' toward the observer, so that if he looks ''radially'', he sees the other dust grains in progressively ''time-lagged positions''. However, the solution is stationary, so it might seem that an observer riding on a dust grain will ''not'' see the other grains rotating about himself. However, recall that while the first frame given above (the &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;) appears static in our chart, the Fermi–Walker derivatives show that, in fact, it is ''spinning'' with respect to gyroscopes. The second frame (the &lt;math&gt;\vec{f}_j&lt;/math&gt;) appears to be spinning in our chart, but it is ''gyrostabilized'', and a nonspinning inertial observer riding on a dust grain will indeed see the other dust grains rotating clockwise with angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; about his axis of symmetry. It turns out that in addition, optical images are expanded and sheared in the direction of rotation.

If a nonspinning inertial observer looks along his axis of symmetry, he sees his coaxial nonspinning inertial peers apparently nonspinning with respect to himself, as we would expect.

===Shape of absolute future===

According to Hawking and Ellis, another remarkable feature of this spacetime is the fact that, if we suppress the inessential y coordinate, light emitted from an event on the world line of a given dust particle spirals outwards, forms a ''circular cusp'', then spirals inward and ''reconverges at a subsequent event'' on the world line of the original dust particle. This means that observers looking orthogonally to the &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_2&lt;/math&gt; direction can see only finitely far out, and also see themselves at an earlier time.

The cusp is a nongeodesic closed null curve. (See the more detailed discussion below using an alternative coordinate chart.)

===Closed timelike curves===

Because of the homogeneity of the spacetime and the mutual twisting of our family of timelike geodesics, it is more or less inevitable that the Gödel spacetime should have [[closed timelike curve]]s (CTCs). Indeed, ''there are CTCs through every event in the Gödel spacetime''. This causal anomaly seems to have been regarded as the whole point of the model by Gödel himself, who was apparently striving to prove, and arguably succeeded in proving, that Einstein's equations of spacetime are not consistent with what we intuitively understand time to be (i. e. that it passes and the past no longer exists, the position philosophers call [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]], whereas Gödel seems to have been arguing for something more like the philosophy of [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]), much as he, conversely, succeeded with [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|his incompleteness theorems]] in showing that intuitive mathematical concepts could not be completely described by formal mathematical systems of proof. See the book ''A World Without Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Yourgrau | first = Palle | title = A world without time: the forgotten legacy of Gödel and Einstein | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 0465092942 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein was aware of Gödel's solution and commented in ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/einstein/works/1940s/reply.htm |title= Einstein's Reply to Criticisms |last1=Einstein |first1=Albert |last2= |first2= |year= 1949 |work= Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that if there are a series of causally-connected events in which "the series is closed in itself" (in other words, a closed timelike curve), then this suggests that there is no good physical way to define whether a given event in the series happened "earlier" or "later" than another event in the series:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In that case the distinction "earlier-later" is abandoned for world-points which lie far apart in a cosmological sense, and those paradoxes, regarding the direction of the causal connection, arise, of which Mr. Gödel has spoken.

Such cosmological solutions of the gravitation-equations (with not vanishing A-constant) have been found by Mr. Gödel. It will be interesting to weigh whether these are not to be excluded on physical grounds.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Globally nonhyperbolic===

If the Gödel spacetime admitted any boundaryless temporal hyperslices (e.g. a [[Cauchy surface]]), any such CTC would have to intersect it an odd number of times, contradicting the fact that the spacetime is simply connected. Therefore, this spacetime is not [[globally hyperbolic]].

==A cylindrical chart==

In this section, we introduce another coordinate chart for the Gödel solution, in which some of the features mentioned above are easier to see.

===Derivation===

Gödel did not explain how he found his solution, but there are in fact many possible derivations. We will sketch one here, and at the same time verify some of the claims made above.

Start with a simple frame in a ''cylindrical'' type chart, featuring two undetermined functions of the radial coordinate:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_0=\partial_t, \; \vec{e}_1=\partial_z, \; \vec{e}_2=\partial_r, \, \vec{e}_3=\frac{1}{b(r)} \, \left( -a(r) \, \partial_t + \partial_\phi \right)&lt;/math&gt;
Here, we think of the timelike unit vector field &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_0&lt;/math&gt; as tangent to the world lines of the dust particles, and their world lines will in general exhibit nonzero vorticity but vanishing expansion and shear. Let us demand that the Einstein tensor match a dust term plus a vacuum energy term. This is equivalent to requiring that it match a perfect fluid; i.e., we require that the components of the Einstein tensor, computed with respect to our frame, take the form
:&lt;math&gt; G^{\hat{i}\hat{j}} = \mu \, \operatorname{diag}(1,0,0,0) + p \, \operatorname{diag}(0,1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt;
This gives the conditions
:&lt;math&gt; b^{\prime\prime\prime} = \frac{b^{\prime\prime} \, b^{\prime}}{b}, \; \left( a^\prime \right)^2 = 2 \, b^{\prime\prime} \, b&lt;/math&gt;
Plugging these into the Einstein tensor, we see that in fact we now have &lt;math&gt;\mu = p&lt;/math&gt;. The simplest nontrivial spacetime we can construct in this way evidently would have this coefficient be some nonzero but ''constant'' function of the radial coordinate. Specifically, with a bit of foresight, let us choose &lt;math&gt;\mu = \omega^2&lt;/math&gt;. This gives
:&lt;math&gt; b(r) = \frac{\sinh(\sqrt{2} \omega \,r)}{\sqrt{2} \omega}, \; a(r) = \frac{\cosh(\sqrt{2} \omega r)}{\omega} + c&lt;/math&gt;
Finally, let us demand that this frame satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_3 = \frac{1}{r} \, \partial_\phi + O \left( \frac{1}{r^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
This gives &lt;math&gt;c=-1/\omega&lt;/math&gt;, and our frame becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_0=\partial_t, \; \vec{e}_1=\partial_z, \; \vec{e}_2=\partial_r, \; \vec{e}_3 = \frac{ \sqrt{2} \omega }{ \sinh( \sqrt{2} \omega r ) } \, \partial_\phi - \frac{\sqrt{2}\sinh(\sqrt{2} \omega r)}{1+\cosh(\sqrt{2} \omega r)} \, \partial_t&lt;/math&gt;

===Appearance of the light cones===

From the metric tensor we find that the vector field &lt;math&gt;\partial_\phi&lt;/math&gt;, which is ''spacelike'' for small radii, becomes ''null'' at &lt;math&gt;r=r_c&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math&gt;r_c = \frac{\operatorname{arccosh}(3)}{\sqrt{2} \omega}&lt;/math&gt;
This is because at that radius we find that &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}_3 = \frac{ \omega }2 \, \partial_\phi - \partial_t,&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;\frac{ \omega }2 \, \partial_\phi=\vec{e}_3+\vec{e}_0&lt;/math&gt; and is therefore null. The circle &lt;math&gt;r = r_c&lt;/math&gt; at a given ''t'' is a closed null curve, but not a null geodesic.

Examining the frame above, we can see that the coordinate &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is inessential; our spacetime is the direct product of a factor '''R''' with a signature -++ three-manifold. Suppressing &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; in order to focus our attention on this three-manifold, let us examine how the appearance of the light cones changes as we travel out from the axis of symmetry &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;:
[[File:Goedel lambdadust samplecones.gif|frame|center|Two light cones (with their accompanying frame vectors) in the cylindrical chart for the Gödel lambda dust solution. As we move outwards from the nominal symmetry axis, the cones ''tip forward'' and ''widen''. Vertical coordinate lines (representing the world lines of the dust particles) are ''timelike''.]]
When we get to the critical radius, the cones become tangent to the closed null curve.
&lt;!-- I'm taking out this figure because I don't think it's right. The cones should remain conical at the critical radius. e0+e2 and e0-e2 are always in the cone, but e0 is not.
[[File:Goedel lambdadust tiltcones.gif|frame|center|A closed null curve depicted in the cylindrical chart for the Gödel lambdadust solution.]]--&gt;

===A congruence of closed timelike curves===

At the critical radius &lt;math&gt;r = r_c&lt;/math&gt;, the vector field &lt;math&gt;\partial_\phi&lt;/math&gt; becomes null. For larger radii, it is ''timelike''. Thus, corresponding to our symmetry axis we have a timelike [[Congruence (general relativity)|congruence]] made up of ''circles'' and corresponding to certain observers. This congruence is however ''only defined outside the cylinder'' &lt;math&gt;r=r_c&lt;/math&gt;.

This is not a geodesic congruence; rather, each observer in this family must maintain a ''constant acceleration'' in order to hold his course. Observers with smaller radii must accelerate harder; as &lt;math&gt;r \rightarrow r_c&lt;/math&gt; the magnitude of acceleration diverges, which is just what is expected, given that &lt;math&gt;r=r_c&lt;/math&gt; is a null curve.

===Null geodesics===

If we examine the past light cone of an event on the axis of symmetry, we find the following picture:
[[File:Goedel lambdadust centralcone inspiral.gif|frame|center|The null geodesics spiral counterclockwise toward an observer on the axis of symmetry. This shows them from "above".]]
Recall that vertical coordinate lines in our chart represent the world lines of the dust particles, but ''despite their straight appearance in our chart'', the congruence formed by these curves has nonzero vorticity, so the world lines are actually ''twisting about each other''. The fact that the null geodesics spiral inwards in the manner shown above means that when our observer looks ''radially outwards'', he sees nearby dust particles, not at their current locations, but at their earlier locations. This is just what we would expect if the dust particles are in fact rotating about one another.

The null geodesics are ''geometrically straight''; in the figure, they appear to be spirals only because the coordinates are "rotating" in order to permit the dust particles to appear stationary.

===The absolute future===

According to Hawking and Ellis (see monograph cited below), all light rays emitted from an event on the symmetry axis reconverge at a later event on the axis, with the null geodesics forming a circular cusp (which is a null curve, but not a null geodesic):
[[File:Goedel lambdadust centralcone.gif|frame|center|Hawking and Ellis picture of expansion and reconvergence of light emitted by an observer on the axis of symmetry.]]
This implies that in the Gödel lambdadust solution, the [[absolute future]] of each event has a character very different from what we might naively expect.

==Cosmological interpretation==

Following Gödel, we can interpret the dust particles as galaxies, so that the Gödel solution becomes a ''cosmological model of a rotating universe''. Besides rotating, this model exhibits no [[Hubble expansion]], so it is not a realistic model of the universe in which we live, but can be taken as illustrating an alternative universe, which would in principle be allowed by general relativity (if one admits the legitimacy of a nonzero cosmological constant). Less well known solutions of Gödel's exhibit both rotation and Hubble expansion and have other qualities of his first model, but travelling into the past is not possible. According to S. W. Hawking, ''these models could well be a reasonable description of the universe that we observe'', however observational data are compatible only with a very low rate of rotation.&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;S. W. Hawking, ''Introductory note to 1949 and 1952'' in Kurt Gödel, ''Collected works'', Volume II (S. Feferman et al., eds).&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of these observations improved continually up until Gödel's death, and he would always ask "is the universe rotating yet?" and be told "no, it isn't".&lt;ref&gt;''Reflections on Kurt Gödel'', by Hao Wang, MIT Press, (1987), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

We have seen that observers lying on the ''y'' axis (in the original chart) see the rest of the universe rotating clockwise about that axis. However, the homogeneity of the spacetime shows that the ''direction'' but not the ''position'' of this "axis" is distinguished.

Some have interpreted the Gödel universe as a counterexample to Einstein's hopes that general relativity should exhibit some kind of [[Mach's principle]],&lt;ref name="Hawking" /&gt; citing the fact that the matter is rotating (world lines twisting about each other) in a manner sufficient to pick out a preferred direction, although with no distinguished axis of rotation.

Others{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} take ''Mach principle'' to mean some physical law tying the definition of nonspinning inertial frames at each event to the global distribution and motion of matter everywhere in the universe, and say that because the nonspinning inertial frames are precisely tied to the rotation of the dust in just the way such a Mach principle would suggest, this model ''does'' accord with Mach's ideas.

Many other exact solutions that can be interpreted as cosmological models of rotating universes are known. See the book{{which|date=January 2018}} by Ryan and Shepley for some of these generalizations.

The '''health action process approach''' ('''HAPA''') is a psychological theory of health behavior change, developed by Ralf Schwarzer, Professor of Psychology at the [[Free University of Berlin|Free University]] of [[Berlin, Germany]].

Health behavior change refers to a replacement of health-compromising behaviors (such as sedentary behavior) by health-enhancing behaviors (such as physical exercise). To describe, predict, and explain such processes, theories or models are being developed. Health [[behavioural change theories]] are designed to examine a set of psychological constructs that jointly aim at explaining what motivates people to change and how they take preventive action.&lt;ref&gt;Conner, M., &amp; Norman, P. (Eds.). (2005). Predicting health behavior: Research and practice with [[social cognition]] models (2nd ed.). Buckingham, England: [[Open University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sniehotta, F. F. (2009). Towards a theory of intentional behaviour change: Plans, planning, and [[Self-control|self-regulation]]. British [[Journal of Health Psychology]], 14, 261–273.&lt;/ref&gt;

HAPA is an open framework of various [[motivation]]al and [[volition (psychology)|volitional]] constructs that are assumed to explain and predict individual changes in health behaviors such as quitting smoking or drinking, and improving [[physical exercise|physical activity]] levels, [[oral hygiene|dental hygiene]], seat belt use, [[breast self-examination]], dietary behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;Biddle, S. J. H., &amp; Fuchs, R. (2009). Exercise psychology: A view from Europe. Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 10, 410–419.&lt;/ref&gt; and avoiding drunk driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Hollie|last2=Sheehan|first2=Mary|last3=Palk|first3=Gavan|last4=Watson|first4=Angela|title=Self-efficacy, planning, and drunk driving: Applying the health action process approach.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/hea0000358|journal=Health Psychology|volume=35|issue=7|pages=695–703|doi=10.1037/hea0000358}}&lt;/ref&gt; HAPA suggests that the adoption, initiation, and maintenance of health behaviors should be conceived of as a structured process including a motivation phase and a volition phase. The former describes the intention formation while the latter refers to planning, and action (initiative, maintenance, recovery). The model emphasizes the particular role of perceived self-efficacy at different stages of health behavior change.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, S. (2005). Stage models of health behaviour. In M. Conner &amp; P. Norman (Eds.), Predicting health behaviour: Research and practice with social cognition models (2nd ed., pp. 223–275). Maidenhead, England: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Models that describe health behavior change can be distinguished in terms of the assumption whether they are continuum-based or stage-based.&lt;ref&gt;Lippke, S., &amp; Ziegelmann, J. P. (2008). Theory-based health behavior change: Developing, testing and applying theories for evidence-based interventions. Applied Psychology: International Review, 57, 698–716.&lt;/ref&gt; A continuum (mediator) model claims that change is a continuous process that leads from lack of motivation via action readiness either to successful change or final disengagement. Research on such mediator models are reflected by path diagrams that include distal and proximal predictors of the target behavior. On the other hand, the stage approach assumes that change is [[nonlinearity|non-linear]] and consists of several qualitative steps that reflect different mindsets of people. A two-layer framework that can be applied either as a continuum or as a stage model is HAPA.&lt;ref name="Schwarzer, R. 2008"&gt;Schwarzer, R. (2008). Modeling health behavior change: How to predict and modify the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors. Applied Psychology: An International Review, 57(1), 1–29.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and [[risk perception]] as distal predictors, [[intention]] as a middle-level mediator, and volitional factors (such as action planning) as the most proximal predictors of behavior. ''See [[Self-efficacy]].''

Good intentions are more likely to be translated into action when people plan when, where, and how to perform the desired behavior. Intentions foster planning, which in turn facilitates behavior change. Planning was found to mediate the intention-behavior relation.&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer, P. M., &amp; Sheeran, P. (2006). Implementation intentions and goal achievement: A [[meta-analysis]] of effects and processes. Advances in Experimental [[Social psychology|Social Psychology]], 38, 69–119.&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction has been made between action planning and coping planning. Coping planning takes place when people imagine scenarios that hinder them to perform their intended behavior, and they develop one or more plans to cope with such a challenging situation.&lt;ref&gt;Scholz, U., Schüz, B., Ziegelmann, J. P., Lippke, S., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2008). Beyond behavioural intentions: Planning mediates between intentions and physical activity. British Journal of Health Psychology, 13, 479–494.&lt;/ref&gt;

HAPA is designed as a sequence of two continuous self-regulatory processes, a goal-setting phase (motivation) and a goal-pursuit phase (volition). The second phase is subdivided into a pre-action phase and an action phase. Thus, one can superimpose these three phases (stages) on the continuum (mediator) model as a second layer, and regard the stages as moderators. This two-layer architecture allows to switch between the continuum model and the stage model, depending on the given research question.

==Five principles==
HAPA has five major principles that make it distinct from other models.&lt;ref name="Schwarzer, R. 2008"/&gt;

''Principle 1: Motivation and volition''. The first principle suggests that one should divide the health behavior change process into two phases. There is a switch of [[mindset]]s when people move from deliberation to action. First comes the motivation phase in which people develop their intentions. Afterwards, they enter the volition phase.

''Principle 2: Two volitional phases''. In the volition phase there are two groups of individuals: those who have not yet translated their intentions into action, and those who have. There are inactive as well as active persons in this phase. In other words, in the volitional phase one finds intenders as well as actors who are characterized by different psychological states. Thus, in addition to health behavior change as a continuous process, one can also create three categories of people with different mindsets depending on their current point of residence within the course of health behavior change: preintenders, intenders, and actors. The assessment of stages is done by behavior-specific stage algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;Lippke, S., Ziegelmann, J. P., Schwarzer, R., &amp; Velicer, W. F. (2009). Validity of stage assessment in the adoption and maintenance of physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption. Health Psychology, 28, 183–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Principle 3: Postintentional planning''. Intenders who are in the volitional preactional stage are motivated to change, but do not act because they might lack the right skills to translate their intention into action. Planning is a key strategy at this point. Planning serves as an operative mediator between intentions and behavior.

''Principle 4: Two kinds of mental simulation''. Planning can be divided into action planning and coping planning. Action planning pertains to the when, where, and how of intended action. Coping planning includes the anticipation of barriers and the design of alternative actions that help to attain one's goals in spite of the impediments. The separation of the planning construct into two constructs, action planning and coping planning, has been found useful as studies have confirmed the discriminant validity of such a distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Sniehotta, F. F., Schwarzer, R., Scholz, U., &amp; Schüz, B. (2005). Action planning and coping planning for long-term lifestyle change: Theory and assessment. European Journal of Social Psychology, 35, 565–576.&lt;/ref&gt; Action planning seems to be more important for the initiation of health behaviors, whereas coping planning is required for the initiation and maintenance of actions as well.&lt;ref&gt;Sniehotta, F. F., Scholz, U., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2006). Action plans and coping plans for physical exercise: A longitudinal intervention study in cardiac rehabilitation. British Journal of Health Psychology, 11, 23–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Principle 5: Phase-specific self-efficacy''. Perceived self-efficacy is required throughout the entire process. However, the nature of self-efficacy differs from phase to phase. This difference relates to the fact that there are different challenges as people progress from one phase to the next one. [[Objective (goal)|Goal setting]], planning, initiation, action, and maintenance pose challenges that are not of the same nature. Therefore, one should distinguish between preactional self-efficacy, coping self-efficacy, and recovery self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=Luszczynska&gt;Luszczynska, A., Mazurkiewicz, M., Ziegelmann J. P., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2007). Recovery self-efficacy and intention as predictors of running or jogging behavior: A cross-lagged [[panel analysis]] over a two-year period. Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 8, 247–260.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the terms task self-efficacy instead of preaction self-efficacy, and maintenance self-efficacy instead of coping and recovery self-efficacy are preferred.

==Psychological interventions==
When it comes to the design of interventions, one can consider identifying individuals who reside either at the motivational stage or the volitional stage.&lt;ref&gt;Schüz, B., Sniehotta, F. F., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2007). Stage-specific effects of an action control intervention on dental flossing. [[Health education|Health Education]] Research, 22, 332–341.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, each group becomes the target of a specific treatment that is tailored to this group. Moreover, it is theoretically meaningful and has been found useful to subdivide further the volitional group into those who perform and those who only intend to perform. In the postintentional preactional stage, individuals are labeled "intenders", whereas in the actional stage they are labeled "actors". Thus, a suitable subdivision within the health behavior change process yields three groups: nonintenders, intenders, and actors.&lt;ref&gt;Luszczynska, A., Tryburcy, M., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2007). Improving fruit and vegetable consumption: A self-efficacy intervention compared to a combined self-efficacy and planning intervention. Health Education Research, 22, 630–638.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "stage" in this context was chosen to allude to the stage theories, but not in the strict definition that includes irreversibility and invariance. The terms "phase" or "mindset" may be equally suitable for this distinction. The basic idea is that individuals pass through different mindsets on their way to behavior change. Thus, interventions may be most efficient when tailored to these particular mindsets. For example, nonintenders are supposed to benefit from confrontation with outcome expectancies and some level of risk communication.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzer, R., Cao, D. S., &amp; Lippke, S. (2010). Stage-matched minimal interventions to enhance physical activity in Chinese adolescents. Journal of Adolescent Health, 47, 533–539. {{doi|10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.03.015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They need to learn that the new behavior (e.g., becoming physically active) has positive outcomes (e.g., [[quality of life|well-being]], [[weight loss]], fun) as opposed to the negative outcomes that accompany the current (sedentary) behavior (such as developing an illness or being unattractive). In contrast, intenders should not benefit from such a treatment because, after setting a goal, they have already moved beyond this mindset. Rather, they should benefit from planning to translate their intentions into action.&lt;ref&gt;Wiedemann, A. U., Schüz, B., Sniehotta, F.F., Scholz, U., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2009). Disentangling the relation between intentions, planning, and behaviour: A moderated mediation analysis. Psychology &amp; Health, 24 (1), 67–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, actors do not need any treatment at all unless one wants to improve their [[relapse]] prevention skills. Then, they should be prepared for particular high-risk situations in which lapses are imminent. Preparation can be exercised by teaching them to anticipate such situations and by acquiring the necessary levels of perceived recovery self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=Luszczynska/&gt;
There are quite a few randomized controlled trials that have examined the notion of stage-matched interventions based on HAPA, for example in the context of dietary behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;Wiedemann, A. U., Lippke, S., Reuter, T., Schüz, B., Ziegelmann, J. P., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2009). Prediction of stage transitions in fruit and vegetable intake. Health Education Research, 24, 596–607. {{doi|10.1093/her/cym092}} .&lt;/ref&gt;  physical activity,&lt;ref&gt;Lippke, S., Schwarzer, R., Ziegelmann, J. P., Scholz, U., &amp; Schüz, B. (2010). Testing stage-specific effects of a stage-matched intervention: A randomized controlled trial targeting physical exercise and its predictors. Health Education &amp; Behavior, 37, 533–546. {{doi|10.1177/1090198109359386}} .&lt;/ref&gt;
and dental hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;Schüz, B., Sniehotta, F. F., Mallach, N., Wiedemann, A., &amp; Schwarzer, R. (2009). Predicting transitions from preintentional, intentional and actional stages of change: Adherence to oral self-care recommendations.

'''''How to Lose Your Virginity''''' is an American [[documentary film]] directed by [[Therese Shechter]] and distributed by [[Women Make Movies]]. The film examines how the concept of [[virginity]] shapes the sexual lives of young women and men through the intersecting forces of history, politics, religion and popular culture. It premiered at DOC NYC, a New York City documentary festival, on November 17, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Synopsis ==

''How to Lose Your Virginity'' explores the concept of virginity from historical origins of the word, [[virgin]], to the modern day definitions perpetuated in popular culture. The film takes a critical look at how virginity is ‘restored’ through [[hymenoplasty]], fetishized by [[pornography]], and celebrated at [[purity balls]]. Linking virginity culture to commerce, the film follows [[Moonlite Bunny Ranch|Natalie Dylan]]'s [[virginity auction]] and the sales of [[artificial hymen]] on the internet. Shechter also visits the set of [[Barely Legal (magazine)|''Barely Legal'']] and discusses the success of the "virginity porn" genre. ''How to Lose Your Virginity'' questions the effectiveness of the [[Abstinence-only sex education| Abstinence-only sex education movement]] and observes how [[sexuality]] continues to define a young woman’s morality and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dove-Viebahn|first=Aviva|title=How to Lose Your Virginity: An Interview with Therese Shechter|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/06/24/how-to-lose-your-virginity-an-interview-with-therese-shechter/|work=June 24, 2010|publisher=Ms. Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stein|first=Sadie|title=Losing Your Virginity Is Harder Than You Think|url=http://jezebel.com/5548592/losing-your-virginity-is-harder-than-you-think|work=May 26, 2010|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The meaning and necessity of virginity as a [[social construct]] is also examined through narration and interviews with notable sexuality experts, such as: former Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders|Dr. Joycelyn Elders]], "Scarleteen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Production ==

The film was directed by [[Therese Shechter]], whose production company Trixie Films is based in Brooklyn. Working with Producer Lisa Esselstein, ''How to Lose Your Virginity'' was shot over several years in the U.S. and Canada. Other films produced by Trixie Films include the documentary feature ''[[I Was A Teenage Feminist]]'' and the documentary shorts "How I Learned to Speak Turkish" and "#slutwalknyc".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Shechter was inspired to make the film because of the growing abstinence until marriage movement and her own experiences as an older virgin. While making the film, Shechter became engaged and incorporated trying on white wedding dresses into the film as a way of looking at how the wedding industry sells virginity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Inequity aversion''' ('''IA''') is the [[social preference|preference]] for fairness and resistance to incidental inequalities.&lt;ref name="Fehr"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fehr |first=E. |author2=Schmidt, K.M. |authorlink=Ernst Fehr |year= 1999 |title=A theory of fairness, competition, and cooperation |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=817–68 |doi=10.1162/003355399556151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social sciences that study inequity aversion include [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[ethology]].

==Human studies==
Inequity aversion research on humans mostly occurs in the discipline of [[economics]] though it is also studied in [[sociology]].

Research on inequity aversion began in 1978 when studies suggested that humans are sensitive to inequities in favor of as well as those against them, and that some people attempt overcompensation when they feel "guilty" or unhappy to have received an undeserved reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1978 |last=Walster |author2=Berscheid |authorlink2=Ellen S. Berscheid  |title=Equity: theory and research |isbn=0-205-05929-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent definition of inequity aversion (resistance to inequitable outcomes) was developed in 1999 by Fehr and Schmidt.&lt;ref name="Fehr"/&gt; They postulated that people make decisions so as to minimize inequity in outcomes. Specifically, consider a setting with individuals {1,2,...,''n''} who receive pecuniary outcomes ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then the utility to person ''i'' would be given by 
:&lt;math&gt;U_i(\{x_i, x_j\}) = x_i - \frac{\alpha_i}{n-1} \times \sum{\max(x_j - x_i,0)} - \frac{\beta_i}{n-1} \times \sum{\max(x_i - x_j,0)},&lt;/math&gt;

where α parametrizes the distaste of person ''i'' for disadvantageous inequality in the first nonstandard term, and β parametrizes the distaste of person ''i'' for advantageous inequality in the final term.

===Punishing unjust success and game theory===
Fehr and Schmidt showed that disadvantageous inequity aversion manifests itself in humans as the "willingness to sacrifice potential gain to block another individual from receiving a superior reward". They argue that this apparently self-destructive response is essential in creating an environment in which bilateral bargaining can thrive. Without inequity aversion's rejection of injustice, stable cooperation would be harder to maintain (for instance, there would be more opportunities for successful [[free rider problem|free riders]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/726/1/Fehr-Schmidt_Handbook_2005-Munichecon.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James H. Fowler]] and his colleagues also argue that inequity aversion is essential for cooperation in multilateral settings.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler JH, Johnson T, Smirnov O. "Egalitarian Motive and Altruistic Punishment," ''Nature'' 433: {{doi|10.1038/nature03256}} (6 January 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they show that subjects in ''random income'' games (closely related to public goods games) are willing to spend their own money to reduce the income of wealthier group members and increase the income of poorer group members even when there is no cooperation at stake.&lt;ref&gt;Dawes CT, Fowler JH, Johnson T, McElreath R, Smirnov O. "Egalitarian Motives in Humans," ''Nature'' 446: 794–96, {{doi|10.1038/nature05651}} (12 April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, individuals who free ride on the contributions of fellow group members are likely to be punished because they earn more, creating a decentralized incentive for the maintenance of cooperation.

===Experimental economics===
Inequity aversion is broadly consistent with observations of behavior in three standard [[experimental economics|economics experiments]]:
# [[Dictator game]] – The subject chooses how a reward should be split between himself and another subject. If the dictator acted self-interestedly, the split would consist of 0 for the partner and the full amount for the dictator. While the most common choice is indeed to keep everything, many dictators choose to give, with the second most common choice being the 50:50 split. 
# [[Ultimatum game]] – The dictator game is played, but the recipient is allowed to veto the entire deal, so that both subjects receive nothing. The partner typically vetos the deal when low offers are made. People consistently prefer getting nothing to receiving a small share of the pie. Rejecting the offer is in effect paying to punish the dictator (called the ''proposer'').
# [[Trust game]] – The same result as found in the dictator game shows up when the dictator's initial endowment is provided by his partner, even though this requires the first player to trust that something will be returned (reciprocity). This experiment often yields a 50:50 split of the endowment, and has been used as evidence of the inequity aversion model.

In 2005, John List modified these experiments slightly to determine if something in the construction of the experiments was prompting specific behaviors. When given a choice to steal money from the other player, even a single dollar, the observed altruism all but disappeared. In another experiment, the two players were given a sum of money and the choice to give or take any amount from the other player. In this experiment, only 10% of the participants gave the other person any money at all, and fully 40% of the players opted to take all of the other player's money.

The last such experiment was identical to the former, where 40% were turned into a gang of robbers, with one catch: the two players were forced to earn the money by stuffing envelopes. In this last experiment, more than two thirds of the players neither took nor gave a cent, while just over 20% still took some of the other player's money.

Games 2.3 (2011): 257–76.&lt;/ref&gt; ran a model prediction competition on two datasets, each of which included 120 two-player games. In each game player 1 decides whether to "opt out" and determine the payoffs for both players, or to "opt in" and let player 2 decide about the payoff allocation by choosing between actions "left" or "right". The payoffs were randomly selected, so the dataset included games like the Ultimatum, Dictator, and Trust, as well as other games. The results suggested that inequity aversion could be described as one of many strategies that people might use in such games.

Other research in experimental economics addresses risk aversion in decision making&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Joyce E., and Thomas A. Rietz's [[University of Iowa]] Discussion Paper, from 1997 ''Do Unto Others: A Theory and Experimental Test of Interpersonal Factors in Decision Making Under Uncertainty'' examines the increased risk aversion from [[lottery]]-choice games to multi-party dealing. It suggests that this could be explained by altruism and a concern for an equitable distribution among all parties (fairness). This paper also used the phrase 'inequity aversion'&lt;/ref&gt; and the comparison of inequality measures to subjective judgments on perceived inequalities.&lt;ref name="AmielCowell"&gt;Yoram Amiel (author), Frank A. Cowell: ''Thinking about Inequality: Personal Judgment and Income Distributions'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies of companies===
Surveys of employee opinions within firms have shown modern [[labor economist]]s that inequity aversion is very important to them. Employees compare not only relative [[salary|salaries]] but also relative performance against that of co-workers. Where these comparisons lead to guilt or envy, inequity aversion may lower employee morale. According to Bewley (1999), the main reason that [[management|managers]] create formal pay structures is so that the inter-employee comparison is seen to be "fair", which they considered "key" for morale and [[job performance]].&lt;ref&gt;Bewley, T. (1999) ''Why wages don't fall during a Recession''. Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|0-674-95241-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is natural to think of inequity aversion leading to greater [[solidarity]] within the labor pool, to the benefit of the average employee. However, a 2008 paper by Pedro Rey-Biel shows that this assumption can be subverted, and that an employer can use inequity aversion to get higher performance for less pay than would be possible otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9442.2008.00540.x/abstract |title=Inequity Aversion and Team Incentives |journal= [[The Scandinavian Journal of Economics]] |volume=10 |issue= 2 |pages= 297–320 |first= P. |last=Rey-Biel|date=June 2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9442.2008.00540.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by moving away from formal pay structures and using off-[[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] [[Performance-related pay|bonus payments]] as incentives for extra performance. He shows that the optimal [[contract]] for inequity aversion employees is less generous at the optimal production level than contracts for "standard agents" (who don't have inequity aversion) in an otherwise identical two-employee model.

===Criticisms===
In 2005 Avner Shaked distributed a "pamphlet" entitled "The [[Rhetoric]] of Inequity Aversion" that attacked the inequity aversion papers of Fehr &amp; Schmidt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shaked|first1=Avner|title=The Rhetoric of Inequity Aversion|date=2005|SSRN=675227}} [[Bonn University]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Shaked has published an extended version of the criticism together with [[Kenneth Binmore|Ken Binmore]] in the ''Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization'' (the same issue also contains a reply by Fehr and Schmidt and a rejoinder by Binmore and Shaked).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Experimental economics: Where next?|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268109002820|journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|date = 2010|pages = 87–100|volume = 73|series = On the Methodology of Experimental Economics|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2008.10.019|first = Ken|last = Binmore|first2 = Avner|last2 = Shaked}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On inequity aversion: A reply to Binmore and Shaked|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268109002844|journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|date = 2010|pages = 101–08|volume = 73|series = On the Methodology of Experimental Economics|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2009.12.001|first = Ernst|last = Fehr|first2 = Klaus M.|last2 = Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Experimental Economics: Where Next?

Hence, by construction inequity aversion must always be at least as good as standard theory when the inequity aversion parameters can be chosen after seeing the data. Binmore and Shaked also point out that Fehr and Schmidt (1999) pick a distribution of alpha and beta without conducting a formal estimation. The perfect correlation between the alpha and beta parameters in Fehr and Schmidt (1999) is an assumption made in the appendix of their paper that is not justified by the data that they provide. 

More recently, several papers have estimated Fehr-Schmidt inequity aversion parameters using estimation techniques such as [[maximum likelihood]]. The results are mixed. Some authors have found beta larger than alpha, which contradicts a central assumption made by Fehr and Schmidt (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring Inequity Aversion in a Heterogeneous Population Using Experimental Decisions and Subjective Probabilities|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2008.00860.x/abstract|journal = Econometrica|date = 2008|issn = 1468-0262|pages = 815–39|volume = 76|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0262.2008.00860.x|language = en|first = Charles|last = Bellemare|first2 = Sabine|last2 = Kröger|first3 = Arthur|last3 = Van Soest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have found that inequity aversion with Fehr and Schmidt's (1999) distribution of alphas and betas explains data of contract-theoretic experiments not better than standard theory; they also estimate average values of alpha that are much smaller than suggested by Fehr and Schmidt (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Contracting under Incomplete Information and Social Preferences: An Experimental Study|url = http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/80/4/1516|journal = The Review of Economic Studies|date = 2013|issn = 0034-6527|pages = 1516–44|volume = 80|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/restud/rdt010|language = en|first = Eva I.|last = Hoppe|first2 = Patrick W.|last2 = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Levitt and List (2007) have pointed out that laboratory experiments tend to exaggerate the importance of pro-social behaviors because the subjects in the laboratory know that they are being monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Do Laboratory Experiments Measuring Social Preferences Reveal About the Real World?|url = http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/abs/10.1257/jep.21.2.153|journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives|date = 2007|issn = 0895-3309|pages = 153–74|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1257/jep.21.2.153|first = Steven D|last = Levitt|first2 = John A|last2 = List}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An alternative&lt;ref name="AmielCowell"/&gt; to the concept of a general inequity aversion is the assumption, that the ''degree'' and the structure of inequality could lead either to acceptance or to aversion of inequality.

==Non-human studies==
{{see also|Inequity aversion in animals}}
An experiment on [[capuchin monkey]]s ([[Sarah Brosnan|Brosnan, S]] and [[Frans de Waal|de Waal, F]]) showed that the subjects would prefer receiving nothing to receiving a reward awarded inequitably in favor of a second monkey, and appeared to target their anger at the researchers responsible for the inequitable distribution of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brosnan |first=S.F. |last2=de Waal|first2=F.B.M. |year=2003 |title=Monkeys reject unequal pay |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=425 |pmid=13679918 |pages=297–99 |doi=10.1038/nature01963 |issue=6955}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropologist]]s suggest that this research indicates a [[biological]] and [[evolution]]ary sense of social "fair play" in [[primates]], though others believe that this is learned behavior or explained by other mechanisms.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} There is also evidence for inequity aversion in [[chimpanzee]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brosnan|first1=S.

The latest study shows that chimpanzees play the Ultimatum Game in the same way as children, preferring equitable outcomes.

==Social inequity aversion==
Fehr and Schmidt's model may partially explain the widespread opposition to [[economic inequality]] in [[democracy|democracies]], but a distinction should be drawn between inequity aversion's "guilt" and [[egalitarianism]]'s "[[compassion]]", which does not necessarily imply ''injustice''.

Inequity aversion should not be confused with the arguments against the ''consequences'' of inequality. For example, the pro-[[publicly funded health care]] [[slogan]] "Hospitals for the poor become poor hospitals" directly objects to a predicted decline in medical care, not the health-care [[apartheid]] that is supposed to cause it. The argument that average medical outcomes improve with reduction in [[healthcare]] inequality (at the same total spending) is separate from the case for public healthcare on the grounds of inequity aversion.

'''Interactionism''' or '''interactionist dualism''' is the theory in the [[philosophy of mind]] which holds that matter and mind are two distinct and independent [[Substance theory|substances]] that exert causal effects on one another.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Robinson|first=Howard|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-link=Edward N. Zalta|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Dualism|year=2016|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one type of [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], traditionally a type of [[Mind-body dualism#Substance dualism|substance dualism]] though more recently also sometimes a form of [[property dualism]].

{{see also|Mind-body dualism#Arguments for dualism}}
Interactionism was propounded by the French [[Rationalism|rationalist]] philosopher [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650), and continues to be associated with him. Descartes posited that the body, being physical matter, was characterized by spatial extension but not by thought and feeling, while the mind, being a separate substance, had no spatial extension but could think and feel.&lt;ref name="sep-mc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Robb|first=David and John Heil|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-link=Edward N. Zalta|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Mental Causation|year=2014|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-causation/|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he maintained that the two interacted with one another, suggesting that this interaction occurred in the [[pineal gland]] of the brain.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica|first=|editor-last=|editor-first=|editor-link=|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online|title=Interactionism – philosophy|year=|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/interactionism|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, its most significant defenders have been the noted philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] and the neurophysiologist [[John Carew Eccles]].&lt;ref name="PopE"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Popper, Karl  |author2=Eccles, John  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Self and Its Brain | publisher=Springer Verlag | year=2002 | isbn=3-492-21096-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper in fact divided reality into [[Popper's three worlds|three "worlds"]]—the physical, the mental, and objective knowledge (outside the mind)—all of which interact,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/p/popper80.pdf Three Worlds by Karl Popper - The Tanner Lecture on Human Values] - Delivered by Karl Popper at The University of Michigan on April 7, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and Eccles adopted this same "trialist" form of interactionism.&lt;ref&gt;

In his 1996 book ''[[The Conscious Mind]]'', [[David Chalmers]] rejected interactionism, but in 2002 he reversed his position and listed it along with [[epiphenomenalism]] and what he calls "Type-F [[monism]]" as a position worth examining. Rather than invoking two distinct substances, he defines interactionism as the view that "microphysics is not causally closed, and that phenomenal properties play a causal role in affecting the physical world." (See [[property dualism]].) He argues the most plausible place for [[consciousness]] to impact physics is the [[collapse of the wave function]] in [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers-caipin"/&gt;

The ''[[New Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' argues that a non-physical mind and mind-body interaction follow necessarily from the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] doctrines of the [[soul]] and [[free will]].&lt;ref name="CathEn"&gt;Maher, Michael (1909) "The Law of Conservation of Energy", ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', vol. 5, pp. 422 ff, http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05422a.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections ==
===Problem of causal interaction===
{{main|Mind-body dualism#Causal interaction}}
One objection often posed to interactionism is the ''problem of causal interaction'' – how the two different substances the theory posits, the mental and the physical, can exert an impact on one another. Descartes' theory that interaction between the mind and the physical world occurred in the pineal gland was seen as inadequate by a number of philosophers in his era, who offered alternate views: [[Nicholas Malebranche]] suggested [[occasionalism]], according to which mind and body appear to interact but are in fact moved separately by God, while [[Gottfried Leibniz]] argued in ''[[Monadology|The Monadology]]'' that mind and body are in a [[pre-established harmony]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; On the other hand, [[Baruch Spinoza]] rejected Descartes' dualism and proposed that mind and matter were in fact properties of a single substance,&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; thereby prefiguring the modern perspective of [[neutral monism]].

Today the problem of causal interaction is frequently viewed as a conclusive argument against interactionism.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Calef|first=Scott|editor-last=Fieser|editor-first=James and Bradley Dowden|editor-link=|encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Dualism and Mind|year=2014|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/dualism/#SH7c|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it has been suggested that given many disciplines deal with things they do not entirely understand, dualists not entirely understanding the mechanism of mind-body interaction need not be seen as definitive refutation.&lt;ref name="iep" /&gt; The idea that causation necessarily depends on push-pull mechanisms (which would not be possible for a substance that did not occupy space) is also arguably based on obsolete conceptions of physics.&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt;

The [[problem of mental causation]] is also discussed in the context of other positions on the [[mind-body problem]], such as [[property dualism]] and [[anomalous monism]].&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt;

===Compatibility with the conservation of energy===
{{see also|Mind-body dualism#Argument from physics}}
A more recent related objection is the ''argument from physics'', which argues that a mental substance impacting the physical world would contradict principles of physics.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt; In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, it would violate the [[law of conservation of energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lycan, William (1996) "Philosophy of Mind" in ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', ed. Nicholas Bunnin and E. P. Tsui-James, Oxford: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Two main responses to this have been to suggest the mind influences the distribution but not the quantity of energy in the brain and to deny that the brain is a [[causal closure|causally closed]] system in which conservation of energy would apply.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CathEn"/&gt;

=== Causal closure ===
{{see also|Mind-body dualism#Argument from physics}}
Taking the argument a step further, it has been argued that because physics fully accounts for the causes of all physical movements, there can be no place for the a non-physical mind to play a role.&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt; The principle, in slightly different iterations, has variously been called ''causal closure'', ''completeness of the physical'', ''physical closure'', and ''physical comprehensiveness''.&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt; This has been the foremost argument against interactionism in contemporary philosophy.&lt;ref name="Chalmers-caipin"/&gt;

Some philosophers have suggested the influence of the mind on the body could be reconciled with deterministic physical laws by proposing the mind's impacts instead take place at points of [[quantum indeterminacy]].&lt;ref name="iep"/&gt; Karl Popper and John Eccles, as well as the physicist Henry Stapp, have theorized that such indeterminacy may apply at the macroscopic scale.&lt;ref name="PopE"/&gt; (See [[quantum mind]].) However, [[Max Tegmark]] has argued that classical and quantum calculations show that [[quantum decoherence]] effects do not play a role in brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tegmark|first=Max|title=Importance of quantum decoherence in brain processes|journal=Phys. Rev. E|date=April 2000|volume=61|issue=4|pages=4194–4206|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.61.4194|url=http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v61/i4/p4194_1|accessdate=18 November 2012|arxiv=quant-ph/9907009|bibcode=2000PhRvE..61.4194T}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Chalmers has noted (without necessarily endorsing) a second possibility within quantum mechanics, that consciousness' causal role is to collapse the wave function as per the [[Von Neumann-Wigner interpretation]] of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name="Chalmers1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Chalmers |year=1996 |title=The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory |series=Philosophy of Mind Series |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-983935-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtgiH-feUyIC&amp;pg=PA156 |pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledges this is at odds with the [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] held by most physicists, but notes, "There is some irony in the fact that philosophers reject interactionism on largely physical grounds (it is incompatible with physical theory), while physicists reject an interactionist interpretation of quantum mechanics on largely philosophical grounds (it is dualistic). Taken conjointly, these reasons carry little force...".&lt;ref name="Chalmers-caipin"/&gt;

There remains a literature in philosophy and science, albeit a much-contested one, that asserts evidence for [[emergence]] in various domains, which would undermine the principle of causal closure.&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt; (See [[emergentism]].) Another option that has been suggested is that the interaction may involve [[dark energy]], [[dark matter]] or some other currently unknown scientific process.&lt;ref name="Rob"&gt;Robinson, H. (2003) "Dualism", in ''The Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Mind'', ed. S. Stich and T. Warfield, Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 85-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible resolution is akin to parallelism—Eugene Mills holds that behavioral events are causally [[overdetermination|overdetermined]], and can be explained by either physical or mental causes alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=E.|title=Interactionism and Overdetermination|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|year=1996|volume=33|pages=105–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; An overdetermined event is fully accounted for by multiple causes at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Althusser|first=Louis|title="Contradiction and Overdetermination," in For Marx|year=1985|isbn=0-902308-79-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[J. J. C. Smart]] and [[Paul Churchland]] have argued that if physical phenomena fully determine behavioral events, then by [[Occam's razor]] a non-physical mind is unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Churchland|first=Paul|title=Matter and Consciousness, Revised Edition|year=1984|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262530743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Melnyk argues that overdetermination would require an "intolerable coincidence."&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt;

While causal closure remains a key obstacle for interactionism, it is not relevant to all forms of dualism; epiphenomenalism and parallelism are unaffected as they do not posit that the mind affects the body.&lt;ref name="sep-mc"/&gt;

Interactionism can be distinguished from competing dualist theories of causation, including [[epiphenomenalism]] (which admits causation, but views causation as unidirectional rather than bidirectional), and [[Parallelism (philosophy)|parallelism]] (which denies causation, while seeking to explain the semblance of causation by other means such as [[pre-established harmony]] or [[occasionalism]]).&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

In ''The Conscious Mind'', David Chalmers argued that regardless of the mechanism by which the mental might impact the physical if interactionism were true, there was a deeper conceptual issue: the chosen mechanism could always be separated from its [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenal]] component, leading to simply a new form of epiphenomenalism.&lt;ref name="Chalmers1996"/&gt; Later, he suggested that while the causal component could be separated, interactionism was like "type-F monism" ([[Russellian monism]], [[panpsychism]], and panprotopsychism) in that it gave entities externally characterized by physical relationships the additional intrinsic feature of conscious properties.&lt;ref name="Chalmers-caipin"/&gt;

'''Intermedia''' was a term used in the mid-1960s by [[Fluxus]] artist [[Dick Higgins]] to describe various inter-disciplinary art activities that occurred between genres in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/leonardo/v034/34.1higgins.pdf Dick Hggins, "Intermedia", re-published in Leonardo, vol 34, 2001, p49 - 54, with an Appendix by Hannah Higgins]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannah B Higgins, "The Computational Word Works of [[Eric Andersen (artist)|Eric Andersen]] and Dick Higgins" in H. Higgins, &amp; D. Kahn (eds), ''Mainframe experimentalism: Early digital computing in the experimental arts'', p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

The areas such as those between [[drawing]] and [[poetry]], or between [[painting]] and [[theatre]] could be described as "intermedia". With repeated occurrences, these new genres between genres could develop their own names (e.g. [[visual poetry]], [[performance art]]); historically, an example is [[haiga]], which combined brush painting and [[haiku]] into one composition.&lt;ref&gt;''Classic Haiku'' ed. [[Tom Lowenstein]], London: Duncan Baird Publishers, 2007, {{ISBN|9781844834860}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Higgins described the tendency of what he thought was the most interesting and best in the new art to cross boundaries of recognized media or even to fuse the boundaries of art with media&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Fluxus/Higgins/intermedia2.html|author=Higgins, Dick|title=Statement on Intermedia|website=Artpool|publisher=[[Something Else Press]]|location=New York|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had not previously been considered for art forms, including computers. 

{{quote|Part of the reason that [[Duchamp]]'s objects are fascinating while [[Picasso]]'s voice is fading is that the Duchamp pieces are truly between media, between sculpture and something else, while a Picasso is readily classifiable as a painted ornament. Similarly, by invading the land between [[collage]] and [[photography]], the German [[John Heartfield]] produced what are probably the greatest graphics of our century ...|Higgins|Intermedia, 1965, Leonardo, vol. 34, p. 49}}

With characteristic modesty, he often noted that [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] had first used the term.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel 'Lecture 111 : On Spenser'&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gene Youngblood]] also described intermedia, beginning in his "Intermedia" column for the [[Los Angeles Free Press]] beginning in 1967 as a part of a global network of multiple media that was "expanding consciousness"—the intermedia network—that would turn all people into artists by proxy. He gathered and expanded ideas from this series of columns in his 1970 book [[Expanded Cinema]], with an introduction by [[Buckminster Fuller]].

==Academia==

In 1968, [[Hans Breder]] founded the first university program in the United States to offer an M.F.A. in intermedia. The Intermedia Area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~interart/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108125036/http://www.uiowa.edu/~interart/ |archivedate=2006-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[The University of Iowa]] graduated artists such as [[Ana Mendieta]] and [[Charles Ray (artist)|Charles Ray]]. In addition, the program developed a substantial visiting artist tradition, bringing artists such as [[Dick Higgins]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Karen Finley]], [[Robert Wilson (dramatist)|Robert Wilson]] and others to work directly with Intermedia students.

Over the years, especially on the Iowa campus, ''intermedia'' has been used interchangeably with ''[[multi-media]]''.  However, recently the latter term has become identified with [[electronic media]] in [[pop-culture]].  While Intermedia values both disciplines, the term "Intermedia" has become the preferred term for [[interdisciplinary]] practice.

Two other prominent University programs that focus on intermedia are the Intermedia program&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.asu.edu/intermedia/]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Arizona State University]] and the Intermedia M.F.A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intermediamfa.org/]&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Maine, founded and directed by Fluxus scholar and author Owen Smith. Additionally, the Roski School of Fine Arts at the [[University of Southern California]] features Intermedia as an area of emphasis in their B.A. and B.F.A. programs. [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec|QC]] offers a B.F.A. in Intermedia/Cyberarts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studio-arts.concordia.ca/undergraduate-programs/intermediacyberarts/]&lt;/ref&gt; Herron School of Art and Design, Indiana University, Purdue University, Indianapolis, has a M.F.A. Program Photography and Intermedia degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herron.iupui.edu/visualart/photography-intermedia Intermedia]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Oregon]] offers a Master of Music degree in Intermedia Music Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~fmo/master/ Master of Music in Intermedia Music Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, Edinburgh College of Art [within University of Edinburgh] introduced a BA (Hons) Degree in Intermedia Arts, and intermedia can be a focus of study in Masters programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eca.ed.ac.uk/school-of-art/undergraduate/intermedia-ba-hons]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6476">In [[Marxist theory]], '''interpellation''' is an important concept regarding the notion of [[ideology]]. It is associated in particular with the work of French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Louis Althusser]]|year=1971|title=Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes towards an Investigation)|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1970/ideology.htm|journal=Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays}}(Verso: 1970, p.11)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Althusser, every society is made up of [[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|Ideological State Apparatuses]] (ISAs) and [[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|Repressive State Apparatuses]] (RSAs) which are instrumental to constant reproduction of the relations to production of that given society. While ISAs belong to the private domain and refer to private institutions (family, church but also the media and politics), the RSA is one public institution (police/military) controlled by the government. Consequently, 'interpellation' describes the process by which [[ideology]], embodied in major social and political institutions (ISAs and RSAs), constitutes the very nature of individual [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]s' identities through the process of "hailing" them in social interactions.

Althusser’s thought has made significant contributions to other French philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably [[Derrida]], [[Kristeva]], [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]].

== Overview ==
In "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Towards an Investigation)",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Althusser introduces the concepts of Ideological State Apparatuses (ISA), Repressive State Apparatuses (RSAs), ideology, and interpellation. In his writing, Althusser argues that "there is no ideology except by the subject and for the subject".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This notion of subjectivity becomes central to his writings.

To illustrate this concept, Althusser gives the example of a friend who knocks on a door. The person inside asks "Who is there?" and only opens the door once the "It’s me" from the outside sounds familiar. By doing so, the person inside partakes in "a material ritual practice of ideological recognition in everyday life".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In other words, Althusser’s central thesis is that "you and I are always already subjects" and are constantly engaging in everyday rituals, like greeting someone or shaking hands, which makes us subjected to ideology.

Althusser goes further to argue that "all ideology hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects" and emphasizes that "ideology ‘acts’ or ‘functions’ in such a way that it ... ‘transforms’ the individual into subjects".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is made possible through Althusser’s notion of interpellation or hailing which is a non-specific and unconscious process. For example, when a police officer shouts (or hails) "Hey, you there!" and an individual turns around and so-to-speak ‘answers’ the call, he becomes a subject. Althusser argues that this is because the individual has realized that the hailing was addressed at him which makes him subjective to the ideology of democracy and law.

Consequently, individual subjects are presented principally as produced by social forces, rather than acting as powerful independent agents with self-produced identities.

Althusser's argument here strongly draws from [[Jacques Lacan]]'s concept of the [[mirror stage]]. However, unlike Lacan who distinguishes between the "I" and the "subject", Althusser collapses both concepts into one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other applications ==
German philosophers [[Theodor W. Adorno|Theodor Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] employ a method of analysis similar to Althusser's notion of interpellation in their text ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', although they do so 26 years before "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses" was released. Rather than situating their analysis on the State, Adorno and Horkheimer argue that the mass media is responsible for the construction of passive subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; So unlike the police officer in Althusser’s example who reinforces the ideology of democracy and law, the mass media has now taken over this role and interpellates, or hails at, the passive consumer.

[[Feminism|Feminist]] scholar and [[Queer theory|queer]] theorist [[Judith Butler]] has critically applied a framework based on interpellation to highlight the [[Social constructionism|social construction]] of [[Gender identity|gender identities]]. She argues that by hailing "It’s a boy/girl," the newborn baby is ultimately positioned as subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media theorist [[David Gauntlett]] argues that "interpellation occurs when a person connects with a media text: when we enjoy a magazine or TV show, for example, this
uncritical consumption means that the text has ''interpellated'' us into a certain set of assumptions, and caused us to tacitly accept a particular approach to the world."&lt;ref&gt;David Gauntlett. ''Media, Gender and Identity: An Introduction''. London: Routledge, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3329">'''Laughter-induced syncope''' is an unusual but recognized form of situational [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (fainting) likely to have a similar pathophysiological origin to tussive syncope. One reported case occurred while a patient was watching the television show ''[[Seinfeld]]'', and was given the name '''Seinfeld syncope'''.&lt;ref name="pmid9328725"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cox SV, Eisenhauer AC, Hreib K |title=Seinfeld syncope |journal=Cathet Cardiovasc Diagn |volume=42 |issue=2 |page=242 |date=October 1997 |pmid=9328725|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0304(199710)42:2&lt;242::AID-CCD41&gt;3.0.CO;2-M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few case reports of this syndrome in the literature. Patients, as in this case, might present initially to the [[Emergency department|ED]], and [[laughter]] should be considered among the numerous differentials for syncope.

Laughter-induced syncope should not be confused with [[cataplexy]], a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions, particularly laughter. Unlike syncope, there is no loss of consciousness in cataplexy, which affects some sufferers of [[narcolepsy]].

To date there have been few cases of laughter-induced syncope documented in medical literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shear Hilarity Leading to Laugh Syncope in a Healthy Man|author=Bloomfield and Jazrawi|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=2005|volume=293|pages=2863–2864|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/293/23/2863.2.extract|doi=10.1001/jama.293.23.2863-b|pmid=15956630|last2=Jazrawi|first2=S|issue=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3362">'''Les Petites Bon-Bons''' was a group of [[Conceptual art|conceptual]]/life artists that originated in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], in the early 1970s. Their activities spanned the nascent [[Gay activism|gay activist movement]], the international correspondence network and the Hollywood [[Glam rock|glitter rock]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;Olds, Kristen. Art Journal, "Gay Life Artists: Les Petites Bonbons and Camp Performativity in the 1970s". June 1, 2013 p. 16-33.&lt;/ref&gt; They are known largely by the work of [[Jerry Dreva]] and Robert Lambert, aka Jerry and Bobby Bonbon, and who achieved much of their fame by effectively manipulating major media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;Chavoya, C. Ondine and Frantz, David. "Axis Mundo: Queer Networks in Chicano L.A." Jan 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Les Petites Bon-Bons was originally coined as the name of a review to be staged by a group of young gay activist friends called the Radical Queens, veterans of the local Milwaukee counterculture and gay liberation scene, but it was never produced. In the hands of Dreva and Lambert, the group identity became a vehicle for the synthesis of art, politics, and sex that concerned them at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Linda Frye. "High Performance, Have You Heard From Dreva?" Vol  3, no. 1 (Spring 1980) p.18-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rock and Roll==
Although other sub-identities became associated with the name, such as a fictional drum and bugle corps,&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Daniel, "Extended Sensibilities: Homosexual Presence in Contemporary Art". The New Museum, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; the Bon-Bons became known mainly as a conceptual rock band. Although they had no musical abilities and had never played a concert, Jerry and Bobby encouraged the notion among the rock journalists they befriended when they moved to Los Angeles, in June 1973 and January 1974, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon "Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-first Century" Oct 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Personal links were formed with [[David Bowie]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Lou Reed]], Sylvester and many others in the rock world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Correspondence art==
Dreva and Lambert had begun sending art projects to artists and writers they admired in early 1971, generating responses from noted critic [[Jack Burnham]], writer and gay activist [[Arthur Bell (journalist)|Arthur Bell]], and eventually generating an invitation to [[Richard Kostelanetz]]’s ASSEMBLING series,&lt;ref&gt;Kostelanetz, Richard, and Korn, Henry and Metz, Mike "Third Assembling". Assembling Press, Brooklyn, NY 1972&lt;/ref&gt; through which they became aware of the formal network of international artists known as The Eternal Network. These included [[Ray Johnson]], the Western Front, [[General Idea]] and [[FILE Megazine|FILE megazine]], Clemente Padin in Uruguay and COUM/[[Throbbing Gristle]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=p4HkDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT141&amp;lpg=PT141&amp;dq=Jerry+and+Bobby+Bonbon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8lBJMWOZl7&amp;sig=nc9UePWTpVLrv-DbhSVEEg8YGF8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitw7_92ODbAhUr_4MKHSzsBBwQ6AEIQzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Jerry%20and%20Bobby%20Bonbon&amp;f=false|title=Art Sex Music|last=Tutti|first=Cosey Fanni|date=2017-04-04|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=9780571328543|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hatnote|See [[Ricci calculus]], [[Einstein notation]], and [[Raising and lowering indices]] for the [[index notation]] used in the article.}}

In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[linear algebra]], [[tensor analysis]], and [[differential geometry]], the '''Levi-Civita symbol''' represents a collection of numbers; defined from the [[parity of a permutation|sign of a permutation]] of the [[natural number]]s {{math|1, 2, …, ''n''}}, for some positive integer {{mvar|n}}. It is named after the Italian mathematician and physicist [[Tullio Levi-Civita]]. Other names include the '''[[permutation]] symbol''', '''antisymmetric symbol''', or '''alternating symbol''', which refer to its [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric]] property and definition in terms of permutations.

The standard letters to denote the Levi-Civita symbol are the Greek lower case [[epsilon]] {{mvar|ε}} or {{mvar|ϵ}}, or less commonly the Latin lower case {{mvar|e}}. Index notation allows one to display permutations in a way compatible with tensor analysis:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{i_1 i_2 \dots i_n}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''each'' index {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} takes values {{math|1, 2, ..., ''n''}}. There are {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} indexed values of {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;…''i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which can be arranged into an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional array. The key defining property of the symbol is ''total antisymmetry'' in all the indices. When any two indices are interchanged, equal or not, the symbol is negated:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\dots i_p \dots i_q \dots }=-\varepsilon_{\dots i_q \dots i_p \dots } .&lt;/math&gt;

If any two indices are equal, the symbol is zero. When all indices are unequal, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{i_1 i_2 \dots i_n} = (-1)^p \varepsilon_{1 \, 2 \, \dots n} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|p}} (called the parity of the permutation) is the number of pairwise interchanges of indices necessary to unscramble {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} into the order {{math|1, 2, ..., ''n''}}, and the factor {{math|(−1)&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is called the [[Parity of a permutation|sign or signature]] of the permutation. The value {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;1 2 ... ''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} must be defined, else the particular values of the symbol for all permutations are indeterminate. Most authors choose {{math|1=''ε''&lt;sub&gt;1 2 ... ''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = +1}}, which means the Levi-Civita symbol equals the sign of a permutation when the indices are all unequal. This choice is used throughout this article.

The term "{{mvar|n}}-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol" refers to the fact that the number of indices on the symbol {{mvar|n}} matches the [[dimension]]ality of the [[vector space]] in question, which may be [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] or [[non-Euclidean space|non-Euclidean]], for example, {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} or [[Minkowski space]]. The values of the Levi-Civita symbol are independent of any [[metric tensor]] and [[coordinate system]]. Also, the specific term "symbol" emphasizes that it is not a [[tensor]] because of how it transforms between coordinate systems; however it can be interpreted as a [[tensor density]].

The Levi-Civita symbol allows the [[determinant]] of a square matrix, and the [[cross product]] of two vectors in three-dimensional Euclidean space, to be expressed in index notation.

==Definition==
The Levi-Civita symbol is most often used in three and four dimensions, and to some extent in two dimensions, so these are given here before defining the general case.

===Two dimensions===
In [[two dimensions]], Levi-Civita symbol is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{ij} =
  \begin{cases}
   +1       &amp; \text{if } (i, j) = (1, 2) \\
   -1       &amp; \text{if } (i, j) = (2, 1) \\
    \;\;\,0 &amp; \text{if } i = j
  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The values can be arranged into a 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 [[antisymmetric matrix]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
    \varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} \\
    \varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22}
  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 &amp; 1 \\
    -1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Use of the two-dimensional symbol is relatively uncommon, although in certain specialized topics like [[supersymmetry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supersymmetry|first=P.|last=Labelle|series=Demystified|publisher=McGraw-Hill|pages=57–58|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-163641-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[twistor theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2013-09-03|title=Twistor Primer|first=F.|last=Hadrovich|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~tweb/00004/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; it appears in the context of 2-[[spinors]]. The three- and higher-dimensional Levi-Civita symbols are used more commonly.

===Three dimensions===
[[File:Permutation indices 3d numerical.svg|thumb|210|For the indices {{math|(''i'', ''j'', ''k'')}} in {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the values {{math|1, 2, 3}} occurring in the {{color box|orange}} cyclic order {{math|(1, 2, 3)}} correspond to {{math|1=''ε'' = +1}}, while occurring in the {{color box|red}} reverse cyclic order correspond to {{math|1=''ε'' = −1}}, otherwise {{math|1=''ε'' = 0}}.]]
In [[three dimensions]], the Levi-Civita symbol is defined by:&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"&gt;{{cite book| first=J.&amp;nbsp;R. |last=Tyldesley| title=An introduction to Tensor Analysis: For Engineers and Applied Scientists| publisher=Longman| year=1973 | isbn=0-582-44355-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{ijk} =
  \begin{cases}
         +1 &amp; \text{if } (i,j,k) \text{ is } (1,2,3), (2,3,1), \text{ or } (3,1,2), \\
         -1 &amp; \text{if } (i,j,k) \text{ is } (3,2,1), (1,3,2), \text{ or } (2,1,3), \\
    \;\;\,0 &amp; \text{if } i = j, \text{ or } j = k, \text{ or } k = i
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is {{math|1}} if {{math|(''i'', ''j'', ''k'')}} is an [[even and odd permutations|even permutation]] of {{math|(1, 2, 3)}}, {{math|−1}} if it is an [[odd permutation]], and 0 if any index is repeated. In three dimensions only, the [[cyclic permutation]]s of {{math|(1, 2, 3)}} are all even permutations, similarly the [[anticyclic permutation]]s are all odd permutations. This means in 3d it is sufficient to take cyclic or anticyclic permutations of {{math|(1, 2, 3)}} and easily obtain all the even or odd permutations.

Analogous to 2-dimensional matrices, the values of the 3-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol can be arranged into a {{nowrap|3 × 3 × 3}} array:

:[[File:Epsilontensor.svg|200px]]

where {{mvar|i}} is the depth ({{color|blue|blue}}: {{math|1=''i'' = 1}}; {{color|red|red}}: {{math|1=''i'' = 2}}; {{color|green|green}}: {{math|1=''i'' = 3}}), {{mvar|j}} is the row and {{mvar|k}} is the column.

Some examples:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \varepsilon_{\color{BrickRed}{1}  \color{Violet}{3}  \color{Orange}{2}} = -\varepsilon_{\color{BrickRed}{1}  \color{Orange}{2}\color{Violet}{3}} &amp;= - 1 \\
  \varepsilon_{  \color{Violet}{3}\color{BrickRed}{1}  \color{Orange}{2}} = -\varepsilon_{  \color{Orange}{2}\color{BrickRed}{1}\color{Violet}{3}} &amp;= -(-\varepsilon_{\color{BrickRed}{1}\color{Orange}{2}\color{Violet}{3}}) = 1 \\
  \varepsilon_{  \color{Orange}{2}  \color{Violet}{3}\color{BrickRed}{1}} = -\varepsilon_{\color{BrickRed}{1}  \color{Violet}{3}\color{Orange}{2}} &amp;= -(-\varepsilon_{\color{BrickRed}{1}\color{Orange}{2}\color{Violet}{3}}) = 1 \\
  \varepsilon_{  \color{Orange}{2}  \color{Violet}{3}  \color{Orange}{2}} = -\varepsilon_{  \color{Orange}{2}  \color{Violet}{3}\color{Orange}{2}} &amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Four dimensions===
In [[Four-dimensional space|four dimensions]], the Levi-Civita symbol is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijkl } =
\begin{cases}
+1 &amp; \text{if }(i,j,k,l) \text{ is an even permutation of } (1,2,3,4) \\
-1 &amp; \text{if }(i,j,k,l) \text{ is an odd permutation of } (1,2,3,4) \\
\;\;\,0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

These values can be arranged into a {{nowrap|4 × 4 × 4 × 4}} array, although in 4 dimensions and higher this is difficult to draw.

Some examples:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\varepsilon_{\color{BrickRed}{1}\color{RedViolet}{4}\color{Violet}{3}\color{Orange}{\color{Orange}{2}}} = -\varepsilon_{\color{BrickRed}{1}\color{Orange}{\color{Orange}{2}}\color{Violet}{3}\color{RedViolet}{4}} &amp;= - 1\\
\varepsilon_{\color{Orange}{\color{Orange}{2}}\color{BrickRed}{1}\color{Violet}{3}\color{RedViolet}{4}} = -\varepsilon_{\color{BrickRed}{1}\color{Orange}{\color{Orange}{2}}\color{Violet}{3}\color{RedViolet}{4}} &amp;= -1\\
\varepsilon_{\color{RedViolet}{4}\color{Violet}{3}\color{Orange}{\color{Orange}{2}}\color{BrickRed}{1}} = -\varepsilon_{\color{BrickRed}{1}\color{Violet}{3}\color{Orange}{\color{Orange}{2}}\color{RedViolet}{4}} &amp;= -(-\varepsilon_{\color{BrickRed}{1}\color{Orange}{\color{Orange}{2}}\color{Violet}{3}\color{RedViolet}{4}}) = 1\\
\varepsilon_{\color{Violet}{3}\color{Orange}{\color{Orange}{2}}\color{RedViolet}{4}\color{Violet}{3}} = -\varepsilon_{\color{Violet}{3}\color{Orange}{\color{Orange}{2}}\color{RedViolet}{4}\color{Violet}{3}} &amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Generalization to ''{{mvar|n}}'' dimensions===
More generally, in [[n-dimensional space|{{math|''n''}} dimensions]], the Levi-Civita symbol is defined by:&lt;ref name="Kay"&gt;{{cite book| first=D.&amp;nbsp;C. |last=Kay| title=Tensor Calculus| series=Schaum's Outlines |publisher=McGraw Hill | year=1988 | isbn=0-07-033484-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{a_1 a_2 a_3 \ldots a_n} =
\begin{cases}
+1 &amp; \text{if }(a_1 , a_2 , a_3 , \ldots , a_n) \text{ is an even permutation of } (1,2,3,\dots,n) \\
-1 &amp; \text{if }(a_1 , a_2 , a_3 , \ldots , a_n) \text{ is an odd permutation of } (1,2,3,\dots,n) \\
\;\;\,0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, it is the [[Even and odd permutations|sign of the permutation]] in the case of a permutation, and zero otherwise.

Using the [[Multiplication#Capital Pi notation|capital pi notation]] {{math|∏}} for ordinary multiplication of numbers, an explicit expression for the symbol is:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  \varepsilon_{a_1 a_2 a_3 \ldots a_n} &amp; = \prod_{1\leq i &lt; j \leq n} \sgn ( a_j-a_i ) \\
                                       &amp; = \sgn(a_2 - a_1)\sgn(a_3 - a_1)\dots\sgn(a_n - a_1)\sgn(a_3 - a_2)\sgn(a_4 - a_2)\dots\sgn(a_n - a_2)\dots\sgn(a_n - a_{n-1})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[signum function]] (denoted {{math|sgn}}) returns the sign of its argument while discarding the [[absolute value]] if nonzero. The formula is valid for all index values, and for any {{mvar|n}} (when {{math|1=''n'' = 0}} or {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, this is the [[empty product]]). However, computing the formula above naively has a [[time complexity]] of {{math|O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, whereas the sign can be computed from the parity of the permutation from its [[permutation#Cycle notation|disjoint cycles]] in only {{math|O(''n'' log(''n''))}} cost.

==Properties==
A tensor whose components in an [[orthonormal basis]] are given by the Levi-Civita symbol (a tensor of [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] rank {{mvar|n}}) is sometimes called a '''permutation tensor'''.

Under the ordinary transformation rules for tensors the Levi-Civita symbol is unchanged under pure rotations, consistent with that it is (by definition) the same in all coordinate systems related by orthogonal transformations. However, the Levi-Civita symbol is a [[pseudotensor]] because under an [[Orthogonal matrix|orthogonal transformation]] of [[jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]] −1, for example, a [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in an odd number of dimensions, it ''should'' acquire a minus sign if it were a tensor. As it does not change at all, the Levi-Civita symbol is, by definition, a pseudotensor. 

As the Levi-Civita symbol is a pseudotensor, the result of taking a cross product is a [[pseudovector]], not a vector.&lt;ref name="Riley et al"&gt;{{cite book|first1=K.&amp;nbsp;F. |last1=Riley |first2=M.&amp;nbsp;P.|last2= Hobson |first3=S.&amp;nbsp;J. |last3=Bence | title=Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=2010 | isbn=978-0-521-86153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a general [[coordinate change]], the components of the permutation tensor are multiplied by the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the [[transformation matrix]]. This implies that in coordinate frames different from the one in which the tensor was defined, its components can differ from those of the Levi-Civita symbol by an overall factor. If the frame is orthonormal, the factor will be ±1 depending on whether the orientation of the frame is the same or not.&lt;ref name="Riley et al"/&gt;

In index-free tensor notation, the Levi-Civita symbol is replaced by the concept of the [[Hodge dual]].

In a context where tensor index notation is used to manipulate tensor components, the Levi-Civita symbol may be written with its indices as either subscripts or superscripts with no change in meaning, as might be convenient. Thus, one could write
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^{ij\dots k} = \varepsilon_{ij\dots k} .&lt;/math&gt;
In these examples, superscripts should be considered equivalent with subscripts.

Summation symbols can be eliminated by using [[Einstein notation]], where an index repeated between two or more terms indicates summation over that index.  For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon^{imn} \equiv \sum_{i=1,2,3} \varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon^{imn}&lt;/math&gt;.
In the following examples, Einstein notation is used.

===Two dimensions===
In two dimensions, when all {{math|''i'', ''j'', ''m'', ''n''}} each take the values 1 and 2,&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt;

{{NumBlk|:
 | &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij} \varepsilon^{mn} = {\delta_i}^m {\delta_j}^n - {\delta_i}^n {\delta_j}^m &lt;/math&gt;
 | {{EquationRef|1}}
}}
{{NumBlk|:
 | &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij} \varepsilon^{in} = {\delta_j}^n &lt;/math&gt;
 | {{EquationRef|2}}
}}
{{NumBlk|:
 | &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij} \varepsilon^{ij} = 2. &lt;/math&gt;
 | {{EquationRef|3}}
}}

===Three dimensions===
====Index and symbol values====
In three dimensions, when all {{math|''i'', ''j'', ''k'', ''m'', ''n''}} each take values 1, 2, and 3:&lt;ref name="Tyldesley"/&gt;

{{NumBlk|:
 | &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon^{imn}=\delta_j{}^{m}\delta_k{}^n - \delta_j{}^n\delta_k{}^m &lt;/math&gt;
 | {{EquationRef|4}}
}}
{{NumBlk|:
 | &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{jmn} \varepsilon^{imn}=2{\delta_j}^i &lt;/math&gt;
 | {{EquationRef|5}}
}}
{{NumBlk|:
 | &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon^{ijk}=6. &lt;/math&gt;
 | {{EquationRef|6}}
}}

====Product====
The Levi-Civita symbol is related to the [[Kronecker delta]]. In three dimensions, the relationship is given by the following equations (vertical lines denote the determinant):&lt;ref name="Kay"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \varepsilon_{ijk}\varepsilon_{lmn} &amp;= \begin{vmatrix}
    \delta_{il} &amp; \delta_{im} &amp; \delta_{in} \\
    \delta_{jl} &amp; \delta_{jm} &amp; \delta_{jn} \\
    \delta_{kl} &amp; \delta_{km} &amp; \delta_{kn} \\
  \end{vmatrix} \\[6pt]
                                     &amp;= \delta_{il}\left( \delta_{jm}\delta_{kn} - \delta_{jn}\delta_{km}\right) - \delta_{im}\left( \delta_{jl}\delta_{kn} - \delta_{jn}\delta_{kl} \right) + \delta_{in} \left( \delta_{jl}\delta_{km} - \delta_{jm}\delta_{kl} \right). 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A special case of this result is ({{EquationNote|4}}):

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^3 \varepsilon_{ijk}\varepsilon_{imn} = \delta_{jm}\delta_{kn} - \delta_{jn}\delta_{km}&lt;/math&gt;

sometimes called the "[[tensor contraction|contracted]] epsilon identity".

In Einstein notation, the duplication of the {{mvar|i}} index implies the sum on {{mvar|i}}. The previous is then denoted {{math|''ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;ε&lt;sub&gt;imn&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''δ&lt;sub&gt;jm&lt;/sub&gt;δ&lt;sub&gt;kn&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''δ&lt;sub&gt;jn&lt;/sub&gt;δ&lt;sub&gt;km&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \varepsilon_{ijk}\varepsilon_{ijn} = 2\delta_{kn}&lt;/math&gt;

===''{{mvar|n}}'' dimensions===
====Index and symbol values====
In {{mvar|n}} dimensions, when all {{math|''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …,''i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''j''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''j''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} take values {{math|1, 2, ..., ''n''}}:
{{NumBlk|:
 | &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{i_1 \dots i_n} \varepsilon^{j_1 \dots j_n} = n! \delta_{[ i_1}^{j_1} \dots \delta_{i_n ]}^{j_n} = \delta^{j_1 \dots j_n}_{i_1 \dots i_n}&lt;/math&gt;
 | {{EquationRef|7}}
}}
{{NumBlk|:
 | &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{i_1 \dots i_k~i_{k+1} \dots i_n} \varepsilon^{i_1 \dots i_k~j_{k+1} \dots j_n} = k!(n - k)!~\delta_{[ i_{k+1}}^{j_{k+1}} \dots \delta_{i_n ]}^{j_n} = k!~\delta^{j_{k+1} \dots j_n}_{i_{k+1} \dots i_n} &lt;/math&gt;
 | {{EquationRef|8}}
}}
{{NumBlk|:
 | &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{i_1 \dots i_n}\varepsilon^{i_1 \dots i_n} = n! &lt;/math&gt;
 | {{EquationRef|9}}
}}

where the exclamation mark ({{math|!}}) denotes the [[factorial]], and {{math|''δ''{{su|p=''α''…|b=''β''…}}}} is the [[generalized Kronecker delta]]. For any {{mvar|n}}, the property
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i, j, k, \dots = 1}^n \varepsilon_{ijk\dots}\varepsilon_{ijk\dots} = n!&lt;/math&gt;

follows from the facts that 
* every permutation is either even or odd, 
* {{math|1=(+1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (−1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}, and 
* the number of permutations of any {{mvar|n}}-element set number is exactly {{math|''n''!}}.

====Product====
In general, for {{mvar|n}} dimensions, one can write the product of two Levi-Civita symbols as:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \varepsilon_{i_1 i_2 \dots i_n} \varepsilon_{j_1 j_2 \dots j_n} = \begin{vmatrix}
    \delta_{i_1 j_1} &amp; \delta_{i_1 j_2} &amp; \dots  &amp; \delta_{i_1 j_n} \\
    \delta_{i_2 j_1} &amp; \delta_{i_2 j_2} &amp; \dots  &amp; \delta_{i_2 j_n} \\
    \vdots           &amp; \vdots           &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    \delta_{i_n j_1} &amp; \delta_{i_n j_2} &amp; \dots  &amp; \delta_{i_n j_n} \\
  \end{vmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

===Proofs===
For ({{EquationNote|1}}), both sides are antisymmetric with respect of {{mvar|ij}} and {{mvar|mn}}. We therefore only need to consider the case {{math|''i'' ≠ ''j''}} and {{math|''m'' ≠ ''n''}}. By substitution, we see that the equation holds for {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;''ε''&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;}}, that is, for {{math|1=''i'' = ''m'' = 1}} and {{math|1=''j'' = ''n'' = 2}}. (Both sides are then one). Since the equation is antisymmetric in {{mvar|ij}} and {{mvar|mn}}, any set of values for these can be reduced to the above case (which holds). The equation thus holds for all values of {{mvar|ij}} and {{mvar|mn}}.

Using ({{EquationNote|1}}), we have for ({{EquationNote|2}})
:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{ij} \varepsilon^{in} = \delta_i{}^i \delta_j{}^n - \delta_i{}^n \delta_j{}^i = 2 \delta_j{}^n - \delta_j{}^n = \delta_j{}^n \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Here we used the [[Einstein summation convention]] with {{mvar|i}} going from 1 to 2. Next, ({{EquationNote|3}}) follows similarly from ({{EquationNote|2}}).

To establish ({{EquationNote|5}}), notice that both sides vanish when {{math|''i'' ≠ ''j''}}. Indeed, if {{math|''i'' ≠ ''j''}}, then one can not choose {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} such that both permutation symbols on the left are nonzero. Then, with {{math|1=''i'' = ''j''}} fixed, there are only two ways to choose {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} from the remaining two indices. For any such indices, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{jmn} \varepsilon^{imn} = \left(\varepsilon^{imn}\right)^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

(no summation), and the result follows.

Then ({{EquationNote|6}}) follows since {{nowrap|1=3! = 6}} and for any distinct indices {{math|''i'', ''j'', ''k''}} taking values {{nowrap|1, 2, 3}}, we have 
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon^{ijk} = 1&lt;/math&gt;{{pad|3em}}(no summation, distinct {{math|''i'', ''j'', ''k''}})

==Applications and examples==

===Determinants===
In linear algebra, the determinant of a {{nowrap|3 × 3}} [[square matrix]] {{math|1='''A''' = [''a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'']}} can be written&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|edition=4th|first1=S. |last1=Lipcshutz |first2=M. |last2=Lipson | title=Linear Algebra| series=Schaum’s Outlines |publisher=McGraw Hill | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-07-154352-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\det(\mathbf{A}) = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \sum_{k=1}^3 \varepsilon_{ijk} a_{1i} a_{2j} a_{3k}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly the determinant of an {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} matrix {{math|1='''A''' = [''a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'']}} can be written as&lt;ref name="Riley et al"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \det(\mathbf{A}) = \varepsilon_{i_1\dots i_n} a_{1i_1} \dots a_{ni_n},&lt;/math&gt;

where each {{mvar|i&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} should be summed over {{math|1, …, ''n''}}, or equivalently:

:&lt;math&gt; \det(\mathbf{A}) = \frac{1}{n!} \varepsilon_{i_1\dots i_n} \varepsilon_{j_1\dots j_n} a_{i_1 j_1} \dots a_{i_n j_n},&lt;/math&gt;

where now each {{mvar|i&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} and each {{mvar|j&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} should be summed over {{math|1, …, ''n''}}. More generally, we have the identity&lt;ref name="Riley et al"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i_1,i_2,\dots}\varepsilon_{i_1\dots i_n} a_{i_1 \, j_1} \dots a_{i_n \, j_n} = \det(\mathbf{A}) \varepsilon_{j_1\dots j_n}&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|1='''a''' = (''a''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|1='''b''' = (''b''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} are [[Vector (geometry)|vector]]s in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} (represented in some [[right-handed coordinate system]] using an orthonormal basis), their cross product can be written as a determinant:&lt;ref name="Riley et al"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{a \times b} =
 \begin{vmatrix} 
 \mathbf{e_1} &amp; \mathbf{e_2} &amp; \mathbf{e_3} \\
 a^1 &amp; a^2 &amp; a^3 \\
 b^1 &amp; b^2 &amp; b^3 \\
 \end{vmatrix}
= \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \sum_{k=1}^3 \varepsilon_{ijk} \mathbf{e}_i a^j b^k
&lt;/math&gt;
hence also using the Levi-Civita symbol, and more simply:
:&lt;math&gt;
(\mathbf{a \times b})^i = \sum_{j=1}^3 \sum_{k=1}^3 \varepsilon_{ijk} a^j b^k.
&lt;/math&gt;

In Einstein notation, the summation symbols may be omitted, and the {{mvar|i}}th component of their cross product equals&lt;ref name="Kay"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{a\times b})^i = \varepsilon_{ijk} a^j b^k.&lt;/math&gt;

The first component is

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a\times b})^1 = a^2 b^3-a^3 b^2\,,&lt;/math&gt;

then by cyclic permutations of {{nowrap|1, 2, 3}} the others can be derived immediately, without explicitly calculating them from the above formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  (\mathbf{a\times b})^2 &amp;= a^3 b^1-a^1 b^3\,, \\
  (\mathbf{a\times b})^3 &amp;= a^1 b^2-a^2 b^1\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====Triple scalar product (three vectors)====
From the above expression for the cross product, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a\times b} = -\mathbf{b\times a}&lt;/math&gt;.

If {{math|1='''c''' = (''c''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''c''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is a third vector, then the [[triple scalar product]] equals

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}\cdot(\mathbf{b\times c}) = \varepsilon_{ijk} a^i b^j c^k.&lt;/math&gt;

From this expression, it can be seen that the triple scalar product is antisymmetric when exchanging any pair of arguments. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot(\mathbf{b\times c})= -\mathbf{b}\cdot(\mathbf{a\times c})&lt;/math&gt;.

====Curl (one vector field)====
If {{math|1='''F''' = (''F''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''F''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''F''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is a vector field defined on some [[open set]] of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of [[position vector|position]] {{math|1='''x''' = (''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)}} (using [[Cartesian coordinates]]). Then the {{mvar|i}}th component of the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of {{math|'''F'''}} equals&lt;ref name="Kay"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (\nabla \times \mathbf{F})^i(\mathbf{x}) = \varepsilon^{ijk}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} F_k(\mathbf{x}),&lt;/math&gt;

which follows from the cross product expression above, substituting components of the [[gradient]] vector [[linear operator|operator]] (nabla).

==Tensor density==
In any arbitrary [[curvilinear coordinate system]] and even in the absence of a [[metric tensor|metric]] on the [[manifold]], the Levi-Civita symbol as defined above may be considered to be a tensor density field in two different ways. It may be regarded as a [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] tensor density of weight +1 or as a covariant tensor density of weight −1. In ''n'' dimensions using the generalized Kronecker delta,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Murnaghan | first1=F.&amp;nbsp;D. | title=The generalized Kronecker symbol and its application to the theory of determinants | year=1925 | journal=Amer. Math. Monthly  | volume=32 | issue= | pages=233–241 | doi=10.2307/2299191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=David |last1=Lovelock |first2=Hanno |last2=Rund |title=Tensors, Differential Forms, and Variational Principles |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1989 |isbn=0-486-65840-6 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \varepsilon^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_n} &amp;= \delta^{\mu_1 \dots \mu_n}_{\,1 \,\dots \,n} \, \\
  \varepsilon_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_n} &amp;= \delta^{\,1 \,\dots \,n}_{\nu_1 \dots \nu_n} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that these are numerically identical. In particular, the sign is the same.

==Levi-Civita tensors==
On a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], one may define a coordinate-invariant covariant tensor field whose coordinate representation agrees with the Levi-Civita symbol wherever the coordinate system is such that the basis of the tangent space is orthonormal with respect to the metric and matches a selected orientation. This tensor should not be confused with the tensor density field mentioned above. The presentation in this section closely follows {{Harvnb|Carroll|2004}}.

The covariant Levi-Civita tensor (also known as the [[Riemannian volume form]]) in any coordinate system that matches the selected orientation is
:&lt;math&gt;E_{a_1\dots a_n} = \sqrt{\left|\det [g_{ab}]\right|}\, \varepsilon_{a_1\dots a_n} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the representation of the metric in that coordinate system. We can similarly consider a contravariant Levi-Civita tensor by raising the indices with the metric as usual,
:&lt;math&gt;E^{a_1\dots a_n} = E_{b_1\dots b_n} \prod_{i=1}^n g^{a_i b_i} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

but notice that if the [[metric signature]] contains an odd number of negatives {{math|''q''}}, then the sign of the components of this tensor differ from the standard Levi-Civita symbol:
:&lt;math&gt;E^{a_1\dots a_n} = \frac{ \sgn \left( \det [g_{ab}] \right) }{ \sqrt{ \left| \det [g_{ab}] \right| }} \, \varepsilon^{a_1\dots a_n} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|1=sgn(det[g{{sub|''ab''}}]) = (−1){{sup|''q''}}}}, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^{a_1\dots a_n}&lt;/math&gt; is the usual Levi-Civita symbol discussed in the rest of this article.  More explicitly, when the tensor and basis orientation are chosen such that &lt;math&gt;E_{01\dots n} = +\sqrt{\left|\det [g_{ab}]\right|}&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;E^{01\dots n} = \frac{\sgn(\det [g_{ab}])}{\sqrt{\left|\det [g_{ab}]\right|}}&lt;/math&gt;.

From this we can infer the identity,
:&lt;math&gt;E^{\mu_1\dots\mu_p\alpha_1\dots\alpha_{n-p}}E_{\mu_1\dots\mu_p\beta_1\dots\beta_{n-p}} = (-1)^q p!\delta^{\alpha_1\dots\alpha_{n-p}}_{\beta_1\dots\beta_{n-p}} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{\alpha_1 \dots \alpha_{n-p}}_{\beta_1 \dots \beta_{n-p}} = (n-p)! \delta^{\lbrack \alpha_1}_{\beta_1} \dots \delta^{\alpha_{n-p} \rbrack}_{\beta_{n-p}}&lt;/math&gt;
is the generalized Kronecker delta.

===Example: Minkowski space===
In Minkowski space (the four-dimensional [[spacetime]] of [[special relativity]]), the covariant Levi-Civita tensor is
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} = \pm \sqrt{ | \det [g_{\mu \nu}] | } \, \varepsilon_{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the sign depends on the orientation of the basis.  The contravariant Levi-Civita tensor is
:&lt;math&gt;E^{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} = g^{\alpha \zeta} g^{\beta \eta} g^{\gamma \theta} g^{\delta \iota} E_{\zeta \eta \theta \iota} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The following are examples of the general identity above specialized to Minkowski space (with the negative sign arising from the odd number of negatives in the signature of the metric tensor in either sign convention):
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
        E_{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} E_{\rho \sigma \mu \nu} &amp; = -g_{\alpha \zeta} g_{\beta \eta} g_{\gamma \theta} g_{\delta \iota} \delta^{\zeta \eta \theta \iota}_{\rho \sigma \mu \nu} \\
        E^{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} E^{\rho \sigma \mu \nu} &amp; = -g^{\alpha \zeta} g^{\beta \eta} g^{\gamma \theta} g^{\delta \iota} \delta^{\rho \sigma \mu \nu}_{\zeta \eta \theta \iota} \\
   E^{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} E_{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} &amp; = - 24 \\
   E^{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} E_{\rho \beta \gamma \delta} &amp; = - 6 \delta^{\alpha}_{\rho} \\
   E^{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} E_{\rho \sigma \gamma \delta} &amp; = - 2 \delta^{\alpha \beta}_{\rho \sigma} \\
   E^{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} E_{\rho \sigma \theta \delta} &amp; = - \delta^{\alpha \beta \gamma}_{\rho \sigma \theta} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematical logic]], the '''Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra''' (or '''Lindenbaum algebra''') of a [[model theory#Definition|logical theory]] ''T'' consists of the [[equivalence class]]es of [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]s of the theory (i.e., the [[quotient]], under the [[equivalence relation]] ~ defined such that ''p'' ~ ''q'' exactly when ''p'' and ''q'' are provably equivalent in ''T''). That is, two sentences are equivalent if the theory ''T'' proves that each implies the other. The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is thus the [[quotient algebra]] obtained by factoring the algebra of formulas by this [[congruence relation]].

The algebra is named for [[logician]]s [[Adolf Lindenbaum]] and [[Alfred Tarski]]. 
It was first introduced by Tarski in 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=A. Tarski| title=Logic, Semantics, and Metamathematics — Papers from 1923 to 1938 — Trans. J.H. Woodger| year=1983| publisher=Hackett Pub. Co.| editor=J. Corcoran| edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
as a device to establish correspondence between classical [[propositional calculus]] and [[Boolean algebras]]. 
The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is considered the origin of the modern [[algebraic logic]].&lt;ref name=BP&gt;{{cite journal| author=W.J. Blok, Don Pigozzi| title=Algebraizable logics| journal=Memoirs of the AMS| year=1989| month=| volume=77| number=396| pages=| url=http://orion.math.iastate.edu/dpigozzi}}; here: pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==

The operations in a Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra ''A'' are inherited from those in the underlying theory ''T''. These typically include [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] and [[disjunction]], which are [[well-defined]] on the equivalence classes. When [[negation]] is also present in ''T'', then ''A'' is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], provided the logic is [[classical logic|classical]]. If the theory ''T'' consists of the [[propositional calculus|propositional tautologies]], the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra is the [[free Boolean algebra]] generated by the [[propositional variable]]s.

== Related algebras ==

[[Heyting algebra]]s and [[interior algebra]]s are the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebras for [[intuitionistic logic]] and the [[modal logic]] '''S4''', respectively. 

A logic for which Tarski's method is applicable, is called ''algebraizable''. There are however a number of logics where this is not the case, for instance the modal logics '''S1''', '''S2''', or '''S3''', which lack the [[rule of necessitation]] (⊢φ implying ⊢□φ), so  ~ (defined above) is not a congruence (because ⊢φ→ψ does not imply ⊢□φ→□ψ). Another type of logics where Tarski's method is inapplicable are [[relevance logic]]s, because given two theorems an implication from one to the other may not itself be a theorem in a relevance logic.&lt;ref name=BP/&gt; The study of the algebraization process (and notion) as topic of interest by itself, not necessarily by Tarski's method, has led to the development of [[abstract algebraic logic]].

'''Many-body theory''' (or '''many-body physics''') is an area of [[physics]] which provides the framework for understanding the collective behavior of large numbers of interacting particles, often on the order of [[Avogadro's number]]. In general terms, many-body theory deals with effects that manifest themselves only in systems containing large numbers of constituents. While the underlying physical laws that govern the motion of each individual particle may (or may not) be simple, the study of the collection of particles can be extremely complex. In some cases [[emergent phenomena]] may arise which bear little resemblance to the underlying elementary laws.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In operation, an increase in current through the fluorescent tube causes a drop in voltage across it. If the tube were connected directly to the power line, the falling tube voltage would cause more and more current to flow, causing it to [[arc flash]] and destroy itself.&lt;ref name="Sinclair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt; To prevent this, fluorescent tubes are connected to the power line through a ''[[electrical ballast|ballast]]''. The ballast adds positive [[electrical impedance|impedance]] (AC resistance) to the circuit to counteract the negative resistance of the tube, limiting the current.&lt;ref name="Sinclair" /&gt;]]

In [[electronics]], '''negative resistance''' ('''NR''') is a property of some [[electrical circuit]]s and devices in which an increase in [[voltage]] across the device's terminals results in a decrease in [[electric current]] through it.&lt;ref name="Amos"&gt;{{cite book

This is in contrast to an ordinary [[resistor]] in which an increase of applied voltage causes a proportional increase in current due to [[Ohm's law]], resulting in a positive [[electrical resistance|resistance]].&lt;ref name="Shanefield"&gt;{{cite book

Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current &lt;math&gt;v/i\,&lt;/math&gt;, and ''differential resistance'', the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;. The term negative resistance means '''negative differential resistance (NDR)''', &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can [[amplifier|amplify]],&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;"''In semiconductor physics, it is known that if a two-terminal device shows negative differential resistance it can amplify.''" {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, and [[gas discharge tube]]s such as [[neon lamp]]s. In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as [[transistor]]s and [[op amp]]s with [[positive feedback]] can have negative differential resistance. These are used in [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] and [[active filter]]s.

Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive "ohmic" resistances usually encountered in [[electric circuit]]s. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can have negative resistance over only a limited portion of their voltage or current range.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; Therefore, there is no real "negative resistor" analogous to a positive [[resistor]], which has a constant negative resistance over an arbitrarily wide range of current.

The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in ''I–V'' graphs where the voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is the independent variable) and is constant.

*'''Differential resistance''' (also called ''dynamic'',&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt; or ''incremental''&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt; resistance) – This is the [[derivative (mathematics)|derivative]] of the voltage with respect to the current; the ratio of a small change in voltage to the corresponding change in current,&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt; the inverse [[slope]] of the ''I–V'' curve at a point:

==Operation==
One way in which the different types of resistance can be distinguished is in the directions of current and electric power between a circuit and an electronic component. The illustrations below, with a rectangle representing the component attached to a circuit, summarize how the different types work:
{|
|-
| The voltage '''''v''''' and current '''''i''''' variables in an electrical component must be defined according to the [[passive sign convention]]; positive [[conventional current]] is defined to enter the positive voltage terminal; this means power '''''P''''' flowing from the circuit into the component is defined to be positive, while power flowing from the component into the circuit is negative.&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt; This applies to both DC and AC current. The diagram shows the directions for positive values of the variables. || [[File:Passive sign convention.svg|140px]]
|-
| In a '''positive static resistance''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, so '''''v''''' and '''''i''''' have the same sign.&lt;ref name="Chua2"&gt;{{cite book

}}, &lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, from the passive sign convention above, conventional current (flow of positive charge) is through the device from the positive to the negative terminal, in the direction of the [[electric field]] '''''E''''' (decreasing [[electric potential|potential]]).&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt; so the charges lose [[potential energy]] doing [[work (physics)|work]] on the device, and electric power flows from the circuit into the device,&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karady" /&gt; where it is converted to heat or some other form of energy ''(yellow)''. If AC voltage is applied, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; periodically reverse direction, but the instantaneous &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; always flows from the higher potential to the lower potential. || [[File:Electric load animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a '''power source''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt; so &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; have opposite signs.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; This means current is forced to flow from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt; The charges gain potential energy, so power flows out of the device into the circuit:&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Work ''(yellow)'' must be done on the charges by some power source in the device to make them move in this direction against the force of the electric field. || [[File:Electric power source animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a passive '''negative differential resistance''', &lt;math&gt;r_\text{diff}\;=\;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, only the ''AC component'' of the current flows in the reverse direction. The static resistance is positive&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; so the current flows from positive to negative: &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. But the current (rate of charge flow) decreases as the voltage increases. So when a time-varying (AC) voltage is applied in addition to a DC voltage ''(right)'', the time-varying current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; and voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; components have opposite signs, so &lt;math&gt;P_\text{AC}\;=\;\Delta v\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; This means the instantaneous AC current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; flows through the device in the direction of increasing AC voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt;, so AC power flows out of the device into the circuit. The device consumes DC power, some of which is converted to AC signal power which can be delivered to a load in the external circuit,&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; enabling the device to amplify the AC signal applied to it.&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; || [[File:Negative differential resistance animation.gif|150px]]

}} In this video Prof. Horowitz demonstrates that negative static resistance actually exists. He has a black box with two terminals, labelled "−10 kilohms" and shows with ordinary test equipment that it acts like a linear negative resistor (active resistor) with a resistance of −10 KΩ: a positive voltage across it causes a proportional ''negative'' current through it, and when connected in a voltage divider with an ordinary resistor the output of the divider is greater than the input, it can amplify. At the end he opens the box and shows it contains an op-amp negative impedance converter circuit and battery.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Unlike in the above devices, the downward-sloping region of the ''I–V'' curve passes through the origin, so it lies in the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the plane, meaning the device sources power.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; Amplifying devices like [[transistor]]s and [[op-amp]]s with positive [[feedback]] can have this type of negative resistance,&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pippard3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisson"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Battery and resistor circuit 2.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|From [[Kirchhoff's voltage law|KVL]], the static resistance of a power source (''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), such as a battery, is always equal to the negative of the static resistance of its load (''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt; ]]

However it is easily shown that the ratio of voltage to current '''''v/i''''' at the terminals of any power source (AC or DC) is negative.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt; For electric power ([[potential energy]]) to flow out of a device into the circuit, charge must flow through the device in the direction of increasing potential energy, [[conventional current]] (positive charge) must move from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; So the direction of the instantaneous current is ''out'' of the positive terminal. This is opposite to the direction of current in a passive device defined by the [[passive sign convention]] so the current and voltage have opposite signs, and their ratio is negative
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{static} = \frac {v}{i} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
This can also be proved from [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]]&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = iv = i^2 R_\mathrm{static} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that power can flow out of a device into the circuit {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;P\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;)}} if and only if &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; Whether or not this quantity is referred to as "resistance" when negative is a matter of convention. The absolute resistance of power sources is negative,&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; but this is not to be regarded as "resistance" in the same sense as positive resistances. The negative static resistance of a power source is a rather abstract and not very useful quantity, because it varies with the load. Due to [[conservation of energy]] it is always simply equal to the negative of the static resistance of the attached circuit ''(right)''.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;

[[Work (physics)|Work]] must be done on the charges by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the positive terminal against the electric field, so [[conservation of energy]] requires that negative static resistances have a source of power.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar"&gt;{{cite book

This derives a slightly more complicated circuit where the two voltage divider resistors are different to allow scaling, but it reduces to the text circuit by setting ''R2'' and ''R3'' in the source to ''R1'' in the text, and ''R1'' in source to ''Z'' in the text. The ''I–V'' curve is the same.&lt;/ref&gt; will reverse the direction of current flow, making its static resistance positive so it consumes power. Similarly, applying a voltage to the negative impedance converter below greater than its power supply voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; will cause the amplifier to saturate, also making its resistance positive.

==Negative differential resistance==
In a device or circuit with negative differential resistance (NDR), in some part of the ''I–V'' curve the current decreases as the voltage increases:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{diff} = \frac {dv}{di} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
The ''I–V'' curve is [[monotonic|nonmonotonic]] (having peaks and troughs) with regions of negative slope representing negative differential resistance.

[[Passivity (engineering)|Passive]] negative differential resistances have positive ''static'' resistance;&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; they consume net power. Therefore, the ''I–V'' curve is confined to the 1st and 3rd quadrants of the graph,&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; and passes through the origin. This requirement means (excluding some asymptotic cases) that the region(s) of negative resistance must be limited,&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; and surrounded by regions of positive resistance, and cannot include the origin.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;

The reason is that in [[linear circuit]]s if the load line crosses the I-V curve of the NR device at one point, the circuit is stable, while in nonlinear switching circuits that operate by [[hysteresis]] the same condition causes the circuit to become unstable and oscillate as an [[astable multivibrator]], and the [[bistability|bistable]] region is considered the "stable" one. This article uses the former "linear" definition, the earliest one, which is found in the Abraham, Bangert, Dorf, Golio, and Tellegen sources. The latter "switching circuit" definition is found in the Kumar and Taub sources.&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''N'''" type): In this type the current is a [[single-valued function|single valued]], [[continuous function]] of the voltage, but the voltage is a [[multivalued function]] of the current.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; In the most common type there is only one negative resistance region, and the graph is a curve shaped generally like the letter "N". As the voltage is increased, the current increases (positive resistance) until it reaches a maximum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), then decreases in the region of negative resistance to a minimum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then increases again.

Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is &lt;math&gt;\Delta v /\Delta i\,=\,-r&lt;/math&gt;. For stability &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Using the formula for a [[voltage divider]], the AC output voltage is&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;

In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance &lt;math&gt;r - R\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than the resistance of the diode alone &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; so the AC output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_o&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the input &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage gain &lt;math&gt;G_v\,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, and increases without limit as &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NDR acts as a dependent AC [[current source]] of value Δ''i'' = Δ''v''/''r''. Because the current and voltage are 180° out of phase, the instantaneous AC current Δ''i'' flows ''out'' of the terminal with positive AC voltage Δ''v''. Therefore it adds to the AC source current Δ''i''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; through the load ''R'', increasing the output power.&lt;ref name="Lowry" /&gt;

The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the [[superposition principle]] the voltage and current at the device's terminals can be divided into a DC bias component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;V_{bias},\;I_{bias}&lt;/math&gt;)}} and an AC component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\Delta v,\;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = V_\text{bias} + \Delta v(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = I_\text{bias} + \Delta i(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Since a positive change in voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; causes a ''negative'' change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° [[out of phase]].&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radmanesh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web

With the proper external circuit, the device can increase the AC signal power delivered to a load, serving as an [[amplifier]],&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; or excite oscillations in a resonant circuit to make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. Unlike in a [[two port]] amplifying device such as a transistor or op amp, the amplified signal leaves the device through the same two terminals ([[two port|port]]) as the input signal enters.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

In a passive device, the AC power produced comes from the input DC bias current,&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to AC power by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal. Therefore, the output power is limited by the bias power&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|P_\text{AC}| \le I_\text{bias} V_\text{bias} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The negative differential resistance region cannot include the origin, because it would then be able to amplify a signal with no applied DC bias current, producing AC power with no power input.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; The device also dissipates some power as heat, equal to the difference between the DC power in and the AC power out.

The device may also have [[electrical reactance|reactance]] and therefore the phase difference between current and voltage may differ from 180° and may vary with frequency.&lt;ref name="Groszkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{cite book

The reason that the output signal can leave a negative resistance through the same port that the input signal enters is that from [[transmission line]] theory, the AC voltage or current at the terminals of a component can be divided into two oppositely moving waves, the ''incident wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_I\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels toward the device, and the ''reflected wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_R\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels away from the device.&lt;ref name="Bowick"&gt;{{cite book

The "reflected" (output) signal has larger amplitude than the incident; the device has "reflection gain".&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; The reflection coefficient is determined by the AC impedance of the negative resistance device, &lt;math&gt;Z_N(j\omega)\,=\,R_N\,+\,jX_N&lt;/math&gt;, and the impedance of the circuit attached to it, &lt;math&gt;Z_L(j\omega)\,=\,R_L\,+\,jX_L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; If &lt;math&gt;R_N\,&lt;\,0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&gt;\,0\,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|\Gamma|\,&gt;\,0\,&lt;/math&gt; and the device will amplify.

The DC load line (DCL) is a straight line determined by the DC bias circuit, with equation
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_S - IR\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt; is the DC bias supply voltage and R is the resistance of the supply. The possible DC operating point(s) ([[Q point]]s) occur where the DC load line intersects the ''I–V'' curve. For stability&lt;ref name="Krugman" /&gt;
*VCNRs require a low impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}}, such as a [[voltage source]].
*CCNRs require a high impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}} such as a [[current source]], or voltage source in series with a high resistance.
The AC load line (''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a straight line through the Q point whose slope is the differential (AC) resistance &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; facing the device. Increasing &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; rotates the load line counterclockwise. The circuit operates in one of three possible regions ''(see diagrams)'', depending on &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;
*'''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;Stable region (green)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): When the load line lies in this region, it intersects the ''I–V'' curve at one point ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; For nonreactive circuits it is a [[stability theory|stable equilibrium]] ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in the LHP) so the circuit is stable. Negative resistance [[amplifier]]s operate in this region. However, due to [[hysteresis]], with an energy storage device like a capacitor or inductor the circuit can become unstable to make a nonlinear [[relaxation oscillator]] ([[astable multivibrator]]) or a [[monostable multivibrator]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22negative+resistance Gottlieb 1997 ''Practical Oscillator Handbook'', pp. 105–108] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515053022/https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC |date=2016-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**VCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
**CCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''Unstable point''' (Line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): When &lt;math&gt;R_L\;=\;r&lt;/math&gt; the load line is tangent to the ''I–V'' curve. The total differential (AC) resistance of the circuit is zero (poles on the ''jω'' axis), so it is unstable and with a [[tuned circuit]] can oscillate. Linear [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] operate at this point. Practical oscillators actually start in the unstable region below, with poles in the RHP, but as the amplitude increases the oscillations become nonlinear, and due to ''eventual passivity'' the negative resistance ''r'' decreases with increasing amplitude, so the oscillations stabilize at an amplitude where&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R_L&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Bistable region (red)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): In this region the load line can intersect the ''I–V'' curve at three points.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; The center point (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is a point of [[unstable equilibrium]] (poles in the RHP), while the two outer points, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[stable equilibria]]. So with correct biasing the circuit can be [[bistability|bistable]], it will converge to one of the two points ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and can be switched between them with an input pulse. Switching circuits like [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s ([[bistable multivibrator]]s) and [[Schmidt trigger]]s operate in this region.
**VCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;
**CCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;

These have negative differential resistance ''(&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; region)'' and produce power ''(grey region)''. Applying a large enough voltage or current of either polarity to the port moves the device into its nonlinear region where saturation of the amplifier causes the differential resistance to become positive ''('''black''' portion of curve)'', and above the supply voltage rails &lt;math&gt;\pm V_S\,&lt;/math&gt; the static resistance becomes positive and the device consumes power.

In circuit theory these are called "active resistors".&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kouřil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miano" /&gt; Applying a voltage across the terminals causes a proportional current ''out'' of the positive terminal, the opposite of an ordinary resistor.&lt;ref name="Crisson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HorowitzVideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; For example, connecting a battery to the terminals would cause the battery to [[rechargeable battery|charge]] rather than discharge.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

Considered as one-port devices, these circuits function similarly to the passive negative differential resistance components above, and like them can be used to make one-port amplifiers and oscillators&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; with the advantages that:
*because they are active devices they do not require an external DC bias to provide power, and can be [[DC coupling|DC coupled]],

*they can be linear circuit elements;&lt;ref name="Groszkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimopoulos" /&gt; if operation is confined to the straight segment of the curve near the origin the voltage is proportional to the current, so they do not cause [[harmonic distortion]].
The ''I–V'' curve can have voltage-controlled ("N" type) or current-controlled ("S" type) negative resistance, depending on whether the feedback loop is connected in "shunt" or "series".&lt;ref name="Crisson" /&gt;

A tuned circuit connected to a negative resistance which cancels some but not all of its parasitic loss resistance (so &lt;math&gt;|R_\text{if}|\;&lt;\;r_\text{loss}&lt;/math&gt;) will not oscillate, but the negative resistance will decrease the damping in the circuit (moving its [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s toward the ''jω'' axis), increasing its [[Q factor]] so it has a narrower [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and more [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite conference

:&lt;math&gt;v_o = v(R_1 + R_1)/R_1 = 2v \,&lt;/math&gt;
So if a voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied "backwards" across &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, causing current to flow through it out of the input.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The current is
:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac {v - v_o}{Z} = \frac {v - 2v}{Z} = - \frac {v}{Z} \, &lt;/math&gt;
So the input impedance to the circuit is&lt;ref name="Muthuswamy" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{in} = \frac {v}{i} = -Z \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The circuit converts the impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to its negative. If &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a resistor of value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, within the linear range of the op amp &lt;math&gt;V_\text{S}/2\;&lt;\;v\;&lt;\;-V_\text{S}/2&lt;/math&gt; the input impedance acts like a linear "negative resistor" of value &lt;math&gt;-R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component.

===Negative capacitance and inductance===
By replacing &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in the above circuit with a capacitor {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;) or inductor (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;)}}, negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; A negative capacitance will have an ''I–V'' relation and an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{C}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;i = -C {dv \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_C = -1/j\omega C \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to ''discharge''; its voltage will ''decrease''. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an ''I–V'' characteristic and impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;v = -L {di \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_L = -j\omega L \,&lt;/math&gt;
A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables.

There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are "non-Foster" circuits which violate [[Foster's reactance theorem]].&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{cite book

''DCL'': DC load line, which sets the Q point.&lt;br /&gt;
''SSL'': negative resistance during startup while amplitude is small. Since &lt;math&gt;r\;&lt;\;R&lt;/math&gt; poles are in RHP and amplitude of oscillations increases.&lt;br /&gt;
''LSL'': large-signal load line. When the current swing approaches the edges of the negative resistance region ''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;(green)&lt;/span&gt;'', the sine wave peaks are distorted ("clipped") and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; decreases until it equals &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. ]]

The common [[Gunn diode]] oscillator ''(circuit diagrams)''&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode ''D'' has voltage controlled ("N" type) negative resistance and the voltage source &lt;math&gt;V_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is &lt;math&gt;dv/di\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt;. The [[choke (electronics)|choke]] ''RFC'' prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit &lt;math&gt;LC&lt;/math&gt;, plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] gives a differential equation for &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2 i}{dt^2} + \frac {R - r}{L}\frac {di}{dt} + \frac {1}{LC}i = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation gives a solution of the form&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = i_0 e^{\alpha t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{r - R}{2L} \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac {1}{LC} - \left(\frac {r - R}{2L}\right)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the current through the circuit, &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, varies with time about the DC [[Q point]], &lt;math&gt;I_\text{bias}&lt;/math&gt;. When started from a nonzero initial current &lt;math&gt;i(t)\;=\;i_0&lt;/math&gt; the current oscillates [[sinusoidal]]ly at the [[resonant frequency]] '''''ω''''' of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing [[exponential function|exponentially]], depending on the value of '''''α'''''. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the positive and negative resistance in the circuit:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
#[[File:Sinusoid decreasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &lt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in left half plane) If the diode's negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; So the circuit does not oscillate.
#[[File:Sinusoid constant amplitude.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r = R \Rightarrow \alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles on '''''jω''''' axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.
#[[File:Sinusoid increasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &gt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during startup.

Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started.&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; A widely used rule of thumb is to make &lt;math&gt;R\;=\;r/3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung2"&gt;{{cite web

}}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; When the power is turned on, [[electrical noise]] in the circuit provides a signal &lt;math&gt;i_0&lt;/math&gt; to start spontaneous oscillations, which grow exponentially. However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude.

At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to be the "average" resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance &lt;math&gt;R\;-\;r&lt;/math&gt; and the damping &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In oscillators where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; just small enough to allow the oscillator to start, the voltage swing will be mostly limited to the linear portion of the ''I–V'' curve, the output waveform will be nearly sinusoidal and the frequency will be most stable. In circuits in which &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is far below &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the swing extends further into the nonlinear part of the curve, the clipping distortion of the output sine wave is more severe,&lt;ref name="Kung2" /&gt; and the frequency will be increasingly dependent on the supply voltage.

The resonant circuit has high impedance only at its resonant frequency, so the circuit will be unstable and oscillate only at that frequency.

===Conditions for oscillation===
Most oscillators are more complicated than the Gunn diode example, since both the active device and the load may have reactance (''X'') as well as resistance (''R''). Modern negative resistance oscillators are designed by a [[frequency domain]] technique due to K. Kurokawa.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurokawa"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[complex impedance]] of the negative resistance part &lt;math&gt;Z_N = R_N(I, \omega) + jX_N(I, \omega) \,&lt;/math&gt; depends on frequency ''ω'' but is also nonlinear, in general declining with the amplitude of the AC oscillation current ''I''; while the resonator part &lt;math&gt;Z_L = R_L(\omega) + jX_L(\omega) \,&lt;/math&gt; is linear, depending only on frequency.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt; The circuit equation is &lt;math&gt;(Z_N + Z_L)I = 0\,&lt;/math&gt; so it will only oscillate (have nonzero ''I'') at the frequency ''ω'' and amplitude ''I'' for which the total impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_N + Z_L \,&lt;/math&gt; is zero.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt; This means the magnitude of the negative and positive resistances must be equal, and the reactances must be [[complex conjugate|conjugate]]&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_N \le -R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;X_N = -X_L \,&lt;/math&gt;
For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the [[reflection coefficient]].&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_N = V_2/V_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, while that of the resonator part &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_L = V_1/V_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Gamma_N \Gamma_L| \ge 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]] for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient,&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions,&lt;ref name="Kurokawa" /&gt; which are often used instead.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

==Amplifiers==
Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make [[amplifier]]s, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Because negative resistance devices have only one ''port'' (two terminals), unlike [[two-port network|two-port]] devices such as [[transistor]]s, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it.&lt;ref name="Iniewski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is ''bilateral''; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] devices such as [[isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s and [[directional coupler]]s.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A circulator is a [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] component with three [[two port|ports]] (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode ''N'' is attached through a filter ''F'' to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing "reflected" amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; of the input and output [[transmission line]]s, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter ''F'' is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{in} = V_I^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
The output power from the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = V_R^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
So the [[power gain]] &lt;math&gt;G_P&lt;/math&gt; of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient&lt;ref name="Das" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;math&gt;R_\text{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the negative resistance of the diode '''''−r'''''. Assuming the filter is matched to the diode so &lt;math&gt;X_1\;=\;-X_N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; then the gain is
:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{P} = |\Gamma|^2 = {(r + R_1)^2 + 4X_N^2 \over (r - R_1)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; while a CCNR amplifier is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as &lt;math&gt;R_\text{1}&lt;/math&gt; approaches the point of oscillation at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers,&lt;ref name="Willardson" /&gt; contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward "leakage" coupling between circulator ports.

[[Maser]]s and [[parametric amplifier]]s are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like [[radio telescope]]s.&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

==Switching circuits==
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in [[switching circuit]]s in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with [[hysteresis]].&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a [[relaxation oscillator]], [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] or memory cell can be built with a single active device,&lt;ref name="Abraham" /&gt; whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the [[multivibrator|Eccles-Jordan multivibrator]], requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are
*''[[Astable multivibrator]]'' – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a [[relaxation oscillator]], and can produce [[square wave]]s or [[triangle wave]]s.
*''[[Monostable multivibrator]]'' – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
*''[[Bistable multivibrator]]'' or ''[[flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]]'' – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and [[digital counter]]s.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the first example of an electronic oscillator. [[William Duddell]], a student of Ayrton at London Central Technical College, brought Thomson's arc oscillator to public attention.&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gethemann" /&gt; Due to its negative resistance, the current through an arc was unstable, and [[arc lamp|arc lights]] would often produce hissing, humming, or even howling noises. In 1899, investigating this effect, Duddell connected an [[LC circuit]] across an arc and the negative resistance excited oscillations in the tuned circuit, producing a musical tone from the arc.&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gethemann" /&gt; To demonstrate his invention Duddell wired several tuned circuits to an arc and played a tune on it.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gethemann" /&gt; Duddell's "[[William Duddell|singing arc]]" oscillator was limited to audio frequencies.&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; However, in 1903 Danish engineers [[Valdemar Poulsen]] and P. O. Pederson increased the frequency into the radio range by operating the arc in a hydrogen atmosphere in a magnetic field,&lt;ref name="Poulsen"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Valdemar |last=Poulsen |title=System for producing continuous electric oscillations |booktitle=Transactions of the International Electrical Congress, St. Louis, 1904, Vol. 2 |pages=963–971 |publisher=J.

===Vacuum tubes===
By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt; [[Heinrich Barkhausen]] in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that [[mercury vapor lamp]]s could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&amp;T had used them to build amplifying [[repeater]]s for [[telephone line]]s.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;

In 1918 Albert Hull at [[General Electric|GE]] discovered that [[vacuum tube]]s could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called [[secondary emission]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal

This represents a current ''away'' from the plate, reducing the plate current.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt; Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a ''decrease'' in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the [[dynatron oscillator]]. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the [[magnetron]] invented by Hull in 1920.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;

The '''Neville–Neville feud''' was an inheritance dispute which took place in the [[north of England]] during the early [[15th century|fifteenth century]] between two branches of the [[House of Neville|Neville family]]. The inheritance in question was that of [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]], a prominent northern nobleman who had issue from two marriages. Westmorland favoured as his [[heir]]s the children of his second wife, [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland|Joan Beaufort]], closely related to the royal family, over those of his first wife, [[Margaret de Stafford|Margaret Stafford]].

After Ralph Neville's death in 1425, many of the Neville family holdings were transferred through legal means to the children of Joan Beaufort (the Middleham [[cadet branch]] of the Neville family), in effect disinheriting the senior branch (the Nevilles of Raby). This led to more than a decade of rivalry between both branches of the family. Ralph Neville's eldest son, [[John Neville (d.1420)|John Neville]], had died before his father. John Neville's son, also named [[Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland|Ralph]], became the 2nd [[earl of Westmorland]]. Though the title earl of Westmorland passed to the senior Nevilles, for legal reasons, many holdings, particularly those of the Neville patrimony in [[History of Yorkshire|Yorkshire]] and [[Raby Castle]] in [[County Durham|Durham]] were transferred to Joan and her children. The [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] Nevilles were also able to consolidate their control over the [[County Palatine of Durham]] after [[Robert Neville (bishop)|Robert Neville]] assumed the office of [[Bishop of Durham]] in 1437.

The senior branch disputed their disinheritance — both legally and by force of arms — but Joan Beaufort's eldest son, [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Richard Neville]], prevailed due to his family's greater political connections. The feud continued through the 1430s, until an agreement was reached in 1443. This settlement was largely favourable to Salisbury, and both branches of the family remained at odds with each other. The dispute between the senior and junior branches of the Neville family continued into the [[Wars of the Roses]]. During the prolonged civil war, the senior branch sided with the Lancastrians, while their cousins sided with the Yorkists. Margaret Stafford's grandsons gave Salisbury no support during the conflict and he was captured fighting for [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]] at the [[Battle of Wakefield]]. Rather than being ransomed according to the usual custom of the time, Salisbury was beheaded by the common people "who loved him not."

==Background and causes==
[[File:Neville Inheritance.png|thumb|Neville holdings in [[Yorkshire]], [[Cumberland]], [[Northumberland]], [[Westmorland]] and [[County Durham|Durham]] in the 15th c.]]
Disputes over divided inheritances were not uncommon in [[Later Middle Ages|later medieval England]]; apart from the dispute between branches of the Neville family, there were similar disputes within the [[Baron Talbot|Talbot]] and [[Mountford family|Mountford]] families. Historian [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]] described these three disputes, where property was transferred from a senior line to a junior line, as "particularly large scale and high profile".{{sfn|Hicks|2002|p=177}}

Ralph Neville, the 1st earl of Westmorland (c. 1364–1425) married twice. His first wife Margaret Stafford, daughter of the [[Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford|earl of Stafford]], died in 1396.{{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} Shortly after her death, Ralph Neville married Joan Beaufort, daughter of [[John of Gaunt]] and cousin of [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]].{{sfn|Hicks|1991|p=266}} They had 9 sons and 5 daughters together: the eldest, Richard Neville, became [[earl of Salisbury]]; their second son, [[William Neville, 1st Earl of Kent|William Neville]], became [[earl of Kent]] and was created [[Baron Fauconberg]]; [[George Neville, 1st Baron Latimer|George Neville]] became the 1st [[Baron Latimer]], [[Edward Neville, 3rd Baron Bergavenny|Edward Neville]] was [[Baron Abergavenny]] and their youngest, [[Robert Neville (bishop)|Robert Neville]], eventually assumed the office of Bishop of Durham.{{sfn|Commire|2000a}}{{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} Historian [[Anthony Tuck]] writes that this marriage "was to have major consequences both for the Neville family and for the English nobility" throughout the 15th century.{{sfn|Tuck|2004a}} 

Neville's new proximity to the royal family through his marriage to the Richard II's cousin, and his loyalty to the Crown during the [[Richard II of England#Second crisis of 1397.E2.80.9399|crisis of July 1397]], led to his elevation to the [[Peerage of England|peerage]] as [[earl of Westmorland]] in 1397.{{sfn|Brown|2015|p=116}}{{sfn|Wagner|2001|p=173}} Joan and Ralph were granted numerous offices, lands, wardships and pensions. They continued to enjoy royal favour until the death of King [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] in 1413.{{sfn|Jacob|2004|p=320}} 

The Neville patrimony included lands in [[Yorkshire]], [[County Durham|Durham]], [[Westmorland]] and [[Cumberland]].{{sfn|Arvanigian|2004|p=28}} After marrying Joan Beaufort, Ralph Neville began the process of disinheriting the children from his first marriage through a legal process called [[enfeoffment]]. The earl's eldest son [[John Neville (d.1420)|John Neville]], had previously agreed to a settlement in which he would inherit only [[Raby Castle]] and [[Brancepeth Castle]] in Durham.{{sfn|Bicheno|2017|loc=ch. 8}} This transfer of property to the cadet branch resulted in the "virtual disinheritance" of the senior branch of the family.{{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} It was done legally and left the senior Nevilles with no legal recourse.{{sfn|Hicks|1991a|p=323}} [[Charles Ross (historian)|Charles Ross]] has noted that the earl's eldest son does not seem to have attempted to stop his father or prevent his son's disinheritance, but may even have assisted with some of the transfers.{{sfn|Ross|1950}} 

This process of transfer of property, the so-called "Neville trust" or "Neville-Beaufort trust", had as its architect [[William Gascoigne]], one of the crown's most prominent lawyers. This might reflect an interest of the crown in retaining the Neville lands with Beaufort descendants, who would be closely related to the royal family due to their shared Lancastrian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reputation and Representation in Fifteenth-Century Europe|last=Biggs|first=Douglas L.|last2=Michalove|first2=Sharon D.|last3=Reeves|first3=Albert Compton|year=2004|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Henry V: New Interpretations|last=Dodd|first=Gwilym|year=2013|publisher=[[Boydell &amp; Brewer]]|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course of the dispute==
[[File:Ralph Neville.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.60|Drawing of [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]]{{'}}s tomb]]

When Ralph Neville died in 1425, the title earl of Westmorland passed to his eldest grandson Ralph "[[fee tail|in tail male]]",{{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} but neither of his sons by Margaret Stafford were mentioned in his will.{{sfn|Petre|1979|p=423}} Joan immediately took possession of [[Middleham Castle]], [[Penrith Castle]] and [[Sheriff Hutton Castle]] for her eldest son.{{sfn|Harriss|2005|p=535}} She also held [[Raby Castle]] in Durham as part of her [[dower]] until her death in 1440.{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|pp=590–591}} Historian J. R. Lander has written that the second earl of Westmorland was as "poor in land as an Earl as his father had been in early life as a baron."{{sfn|Lander|1980|p=177}} 

Only some estates in [[Brancepeth]], [[History of Northumberland|Northumberland]], Lincolnshire, two inns in London and [[History of Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Bywell Castle]] and property in [[Ripon]] were left for the senior Neville inheritance.{{sfn|Lewis|2015|loc=ch. 4}} The vast Yorkshire properties of [[Middleham Castle]], [[Sheriff Hutton Castle]] and [[Wensleydale]] all went to Richard Neville,{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|pp=590–591}} who also became Warden of the West March when he inherited the [[Honour of Penrith]] in [[Cumberland]].{{sfn|Bicheno|2017|loc=ch. 8}} {{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} His wife, 15-year-old [[Alice Montacute, 5th Countess of Salisbury|Alice Montagu]], was the sole heir of the [[Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury|late Earl of Salisbury]],{{sfn|Commire|2000b}} so Richard also inherited the title [[earl of Salisbury]] in 1428 when his father-in-law was killed in the [[Hundred Years' War]].{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=217}} 

Westmorland spent much of life trying to recover the properties at Middleham, Sheriff Hutton, Penrith and Raby, but he was largely unsuccessful, because Joan Beaufort had powerful allies amongst the nobility including [[Thomas Langley]], the [[Bishop of Durham]], and her brother [[Cardinal Beaufort]].{{sfn|Pollard|2004a}} Langley withheld the [[patronage]] of the [[county palatine]] from the second earl, and denied him any available official offices or positions under the bishop's grant.{{sfn|Tuck|2004a}} Westmorland entered into recognisances with the Beaufort-Nevilles in 1430, after Salisbury brought the matter before the King's council.{{sfn|Jacob|2004|p=322}} When Salisbury departed for the Hundred Years' War in 1431 and again in 1436, Westmorland was once again [[bound over]] to keep the King's peace.{{sfn|Pollard|2004b}} However, in 1435, complaints from the North reached the [[Lord Chancellor]] that the dispute between the elder and junior branches of the Neville family had resulted in the assembling "by manner of war and insurrection, great routs and companies upon the field, which have done all manner of great offences".{{sfn|Baldwin|2011|loc=ch. 1}}

When the Bishop of Durham died in 1437, [[Cardinal Beaufort]] used his influence on the king's council to help Joan's younger son [[Robert Neville (bishop)|Robert Neville]] become the new Bishop. The [[House of Beaufort]] was able to gradually consolidate its control over the holding.{{sfn|Tuck|2004a}} By 1441, Salisbury's younger brother Lord Fauconberg was steward and military commander of Durham.{{sfn|Pollard|2004c}} There were a number of attempts to arbitrate a settlement in council, and between 1441 and 1443 both parties were constrained by bonds not to enter each other's estates except with permission. Historian [[R. L. Storey]] has questioned—with Salisbury being such a significant member of the council—whether Westmorland ever had "much faith in its impartiality".{{sfn|Storey|1986|p=113}}

[[File:Raby Castle - geograph.org.uk - 29645.jpg|thumb|[[Raby Castle]], seat of the Neville Earls of Westmorland, until it was inherited by [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] who held the Durham property in [[dower]] until her death in 1440.{{sfn|Dobson|2005|p=186}}]]

==Aftermath and consequences==

[[File:Middleham Castle - geograph.org.uk - 610849.jpg|thumb|[[Middleham Castle]], seat of [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland]] and later her son the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]].]]
A peace was finally agreed between Salisbury and Westmorland on 26 August 1443.{{sfn|Jacob|2004|p=323}} Pollard writes that the "settlement" signified a "crushing defeat" for Ralph II {{sfn|Pollard|2004a}} and that the "odds had been heavily stacked" against him from the start.{{sfn|Pollard|2007|p=14}} True, he was confirmed in his right to the Lordship of [[Raby Castle]], but had to surrender everything else he had previously claimed from Salisbury back to him. He was also placed in bonds of £400 to keep to the agreement in the future, not just to Salisbury, but to his four brothers as well.{{sfn|Pollard|2004a}} Westmorland had to renounce all claims to the Neville lands in [[County Durham]], and had to pay annual rents to Salisbury for various Northumberland manors.{{sfn|Jacob|2004|p=323}} Salisbury was not subject to similar constraints, merely having to agree to not claim the £400 pension while Westmorland adhered to their agreement.{{sfn|Storey|1986|p=186}}

[[J.R. Lander]] described the Neville–Neville feud as illustrating how the Neville family "never could and never did work together".{{sfn|Lander|1986|p=32}} The dispute between the senior and junior branches of the Neville family continued into the Wars of the Roses.{{sfn|Wagner|2001|p=174}} During the prolonged conflict that ravaged the English nobility, Westmorland gave his half-brother no support at all; in fact Westmorland's younger brother, [[John Neville, Baron Neville|Lord John Neville]] died fighting for the Lancastrian [[King Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] at the [[Battle of Towton]] in 1461.{{sfn|Griffiths|1991|p=342}} Salisbury himself was captured at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] and instead of being ransomed, he was beheaded by the common people, who "loved him not."{{sfn|Haigh|2001}} Lander also suggested that if had been united as a family behind Salisbury, who supported [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]] during the Wars of the Roses, York's "power in the land would have been overwhelming".{{sfn|Storey|1986|p=177}}

'''''On Truth''''' is a 2006 book by [[Harry Frankfurt]]. It is a follow-up to his 1986 essay, ''[[On Bullshit]]''.&lt;ref name="The New York Times - Sunday Book Review - Bull Session - 12 November 2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/books/review/McCulloch.t.html|title=Sunday Book Review - Bull Session|last=McCulloch|first=Alison|date=November 12, 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''On Truth'', Frankfurt develops the argument that individuals should care about the [[truth]], regardless of whether they intend to be truthful. Frankfurt explicitly avoids a definition of "truth" beyond the idea of the commonsense concept of truth people commonly hold, i.e., that which [[Correspondence theory of truth|corresponds]] to [[reality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCulloch|first1=Alison|title=On Truth By Harry G. Frankfurt - Books - Review|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/books/review/McCulloch.t.html|work=The New York Times|date=12 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Frankfurt's strategy is to show that the truth, whether an individual is to be truthful or not, is integral to nearly every endeavor, the final point of his argument being that it is a requirement for self-knowledge and therefore all distinctions between ourselves and the world. Frankfurt concludes that the importance of truth, and thus the need to care about it, is incorrigible thereby.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9140">'''Possession is nine-tenths of the law''' is an [[idiom|expression]] meaning that ownership is easier to maintain if one has possession of something, or difficult to enforce if one does not. The expression is also stated as "possession is nine points of the law", which is credited as derived from the Scottish expression "possession is eleven points in the law, and they say there are but twelve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Albert M. Martin |year=1882 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDnnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA355&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hLm5QcF-yH&amp;sig=kOK8OdT0Uh5PxMxpCXXWqynOHy0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=He3-T9TIK4fO2AW4hJW0BA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Answers |journal=The Chautauquan |volume=3 |issue=October 1882 |pages= |publisher=Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the principle is an oversimplification, it can be restated as: "In a property dispute (whether real or personal), in the absence of clear and compelling testimony or documentation to the contrary, the person in actual, custodial possession of the property is presumed to be the rightful owner. The rightful owner shall have their possession returned to them; if taken or used. The shirt or blouse you are currently wearing is presumed to be yours, unless someone can prove that it is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.parlidebate.org/pdf/vol6no3.pdf|title=Government's defense of the Status Quo: Advocating a shift in applying presumption theory in intercollegiate parliamentary debate|author=S Rutledge|publisher=Parliamentary Debate|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The adage is not literally true, that by law the person in possession is presumed to have a nine times stronger claim than anyone else, but that "it places in a strong light the legal truth that every claimant must succeed by the strength of his own title, and not by the weakness of his antagonist's."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=3|publisher=Pace Y.B.

Under Roman law, it was an [[wikt:interdictum|interdictum]] ordering the parties to maintain possession of property until it was determined who owned the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/mcglr38&amp;section=52|volume=38|publisher=McGeorge L.

==In anarcho-capitalist theory==
[[Walter Block]] has stated, "Suppose that 100 slaves worked on the plantation, but only one heir of any of them, B, can now be found. Does B get the entire value of the landed estate (apart from the house), or only one percent of it. The answer is the latter. For possession is 9/10ths of the law. He who is the present land holder (W in our case) is always deemed to be the proper owner, unless evidence to the contrary can be adduced. But the claim of B, stemming from the work of his grandfather, B, can at most encompass what he, B, that is, contributed to the enhancement of the value of the property. The other ninety-nine percent of the value of this land will remain with W, until and unless other grandchildren of slaves come forth with proof of parentage."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Radical libertarianism: applying libertarian principles to dealing with the unjust government|author=Block, Walter|url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/28/rp_28_7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray Rothbard]] noted that [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] "conclude that even though the property was originally stolen, that if  the victim or his heirs cannot be found, and if the current possessor was not the actual criminal who stole the property, then title to that property belongs properly, justly, and ethically to its current possessor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethics of Liberty|url=http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/nine.asp|chapter=Property and Criminality|author=Rothbard, Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''principles of grouping''' (or '''Gestalt laws of grouping''') are a set of principles in [[psychology]], first proposed by [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologists]] to account for the observation that humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects, a principle known as [[Prägnanz]]. Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are organized into five categories: Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Connectedness.&lt;ref name=Gray2006a/&gt;{{sfn|Wolfe|Kluender|Levi|Bartoshuk|2008|pp=78,80}}{{sfn|Goldstein|2009|pp=105&amp;ndash;107}}{{sfn|Banerjee|1994|pp=107&amp;ndash;108}}

[[Irvin Rock]] and Steve Palmer, who are acknowledged as having built upon the work of [[Max Wertheimer]] and others and to have identified additional grouping principles,{{sfn|Weiten|1998|pp=144}} note that Wertheimer's laws have come to be called the "Gestalt laws of grouping" but state that "perhaps a more appropriate description" is "principles of grouping."{{sfn|Palmer|Neff|Beck|1997|pp=63}}{{sfn|Palmer|2003|pp=180&amp;ndash;181}}Rock and Palmer helped to further Wertheimer's research to explain human perception of groups of objects and how we perceive&amp;nbsp;''parts''&amp;nbsp;of objects and form&amp;nbsp;''whole''&amp;nbsp;objects on the basis of these.

== Proximity ==
[[File:Gestalt proximity.svg|left|thumb|Law of Proximity]]
The Gestalt law of proximity states that "objects or shapes that are close to one another appear to form groups". Even if the shapes, sizes, and objects are radically different, they will appear as a group if they are close.

* Refers to the way smaller elements are "assembled" in a composition.
* Also called "grouping," the principle concerns the effect generated when the collective presence of the set of elements becomes more meaningful than their presence as separate elements.
* Arranging words into sentences or titles is an obvious way to group unrelated elements to enhance their meaning (it also depends on a correct order for [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]]).
* Grouping the words also changes the [[visual]] and [[psychological]] meaning of the composition in non-verbal ways unrelated to their meaning.
* Elements which are grouped together create the illusion of shapes or planes in space, even if the elements are not touching.
* Grouping of this sort can be achieved with tone or value, color, shape, size, or other physical attributes.

== Similarity ==
[[File:Gestalt similarity.svg|left|thumb|Law of Similarity]]
The principle of similarity states that, all else being equal, [[perception]] lends itself to seeing [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] that physically resemble each other as part of the same object, and stimuli that are different as part of a different object. This allows for people to distinguish between adjacent and overlapping objects based on their visual texture and resemblance. Other stimuli that have different features are generally not perceived as part of the object.  Our [[brain]] uses similarity to distinguish between objects which might lie  adjacent to or overlap with each other based upon their visual texture.  An example of this is a large area of land used by numerous independent farmers to grow crops.  Each farmer may use a unique planting style which distinguishes his field from another.  Another example is a field of flowers which differ only by color.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The principles of similarity and proximity often work together to form a Visual Hierarchy. Either principle can dominate the other, depending on the application and combination of the two. For example, in the grid to the left, the similarity principle dominates the proximity principle and you probably see rows before you see columns.

== Closure ==
[[File:Gestalt closure.svg|left|thumb|Law of Closure]]
The principle of closure refers to the [[mind]]’s tendency to see complete figures or forms even if a picture is incomplete, partially hidden by other objects, or if part of the information needed to make a complete [[picture]] in our [[mind]]s is missing.  For example, if part of a shape’s border is missing people still tend to see the shape as completely enclosed by the border and ignore the gaps. This reaction stems from our mind’s natural tendency to recognize patterns that are familiar to us and thus fill in any [[information]] that may be missing.

Closure is also thought to have evolved from ancestral survival instincts in that if one was to partially see a predator their mind would automatically complete the picture and know that it was a time to react to potential danger even if not all the necessary information was readily available.

== Good continuation ==
[[File:CrossKeys.png|left|thumb|Law of good continuation]]
When there is an intersection between two or more objects, people tend to perceive each object as a single uninterrupted object. This allows differentiation of stimuli even when they come in visual overlap. We have a tendency to group and organize lines or curves that follow an established direction over those defined by sharp and abrupt changes in directionamasing...{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
{{clear left}}

== Common fate ==
[[File:Red-billed quelea flocking at waterhole.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Law of common fate—a [[Flock (birds)|flock of birds]].]]
When visual elements are seen moving in the same direction at the same rate ([[optical flow]]), perception associates the movement as part of the same stimulus. For example, birds may be distinguished from their background as a single flock because they are moving in the same direction and at the same velocity, even when each bird is seen—from a distance—as little more than a dot. The moving 'dots' appear to be part of a unified whole. Similarly, two flocks of birds can cross each other in a viewer's visual field, but they will nonetheless continue to be experienced as separate flocks because each bird has a direction common to its flock.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

This allows people to make out moving objects even when other details (such as the objects color or outline) are obscured. This ability likely arose from the evolutionary need to distinguish a [[camouflage]]d predator from its background.

The law of common fate is used extensively in user-interface design, for example where the movement of a [[scrollbar]] is synchronised with the movement (i.e. cropping) of a window's [[Virtual desktop|content viewport]]; The movement of a physical mouse is synchronised with the movement of an on-screen arrow cursor, and so on.

== Good form ==
[[File:Olympic Rings.svg|thumb|left|Principle of good form]]
The principle of good form refers to the tendency to group together forms of similar shape, pattern, color, etc.  Even in cases where two or more forms clearly  overlap, the human brain interprets them in a way that allows people to differentiate different patterns and/or shapes. An example would be a pile of presents where a dozen packages of different size and shape are wrapped in just three or so patterns of wrapping paper, or the Olympic Rings.

The first '''Reason Rally''' was a public gathering for [[secularism]] and [[religious skepticism]] held on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on March 24, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Aratani, Lori, " 'Godless Rally' in D.C. for Recognition and Respect", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', C1, C10; Sunday, March 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=Reason Rally - About|url=http://reasonrally.org/about/|accessdate=April 7, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402171445/http://reasonrally.org/about/|archivedate=April 2, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally was sponsored by major [[atheism|atheistic]] and secular organizations of the United States and was regarded as a "[[Woodstock]] for atheists and skeptics". A second Reason Rally was held on June 4, 2016 at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C..

Speakers and performers at the first rally included biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], physicist [[Lawrence M. Krauss]], musician [[Tim Minchin]], ''[[MythBusters]]'' co-host [[Adam Savage]], actor-comedian [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Paul Provenza]], [[PZ Myers]], [[Jessica Ahlquist]], [[Dan Barker]], and magician [[James Randi]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reasonrally.org/speakers-2/ |title=Speakers |publisher=Reason Rally |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606192653/http://reasonrally.org/speakers-2/ |archivedate=2012-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The punk rock band [[Bad Religion]] performed and other notables (Rep. [[Pete Stark]], Sen. [[Tom Harkin]], comedian [[Bill Maher]], magician [[Penn Jillette]]) addressed the crowd by video link. Participants recited the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], deliberately omitting the phrase "under God", which was added by the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1954. Veterans of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]] were represented, and a retired [[United States Army|Army]] colonel, Kirk Lamb, led veterans in an affirmation of their secular [[United States Uniformed Services Oath of Office|military oaths]].&lt;ref&gt;Torpy, Jason, [http://blog.militaryatheists.org/ “Reason Rally shows patriotism and military support”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320172315/http://blog.militaryatheists.org/ |date=2012-03-20 }}, ''Atheists in Foxholes News'', 26 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Speakers urged those assembled to contact local and national representatives and ask them to support church-state separation, science education, marriage equality for gays and lesbians, and ending government support of faith-based organizations, among other causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Winston| first = Kimberly| title = ''Nonbelievers flex their political muscles''|year = 2012|newspaper=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/nonbelievers-flex-their-political-muscles/2012/05/09/gIQABIAnDU_story.html|accessdate =May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the official website of the first rally, the aim of the Reason Rally was to "unify, energize, and embolden secular people nationwide, while dispelling the negative opinions held by so much of American society."&lt;ref name=About /&gt; The website had predicted it would be "the largest secular event in world history." ''[[The Atlantic]]'' said 20,000 people were in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Fearnow &amp; Mickey Woods, [https://www.theatlantic.com/national/print/2012/03/richard-dawkins-preaches-to-nonbelievers-at-reason-rally/255012/ "Richard Dawkins Preaches to Nonbelievers at Reason Rally"], ''The Atlantic'', March 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Religion News Service]]'' said 8,000–10,000.&lt;ref name=winston /&gt; The documentary ''[[The Unbelievers]]'' says that over 30,000 people attended the rally.&lt;ref&gt;Gus Holwerda, [http://unbelieversmovie.com/ "The Unbelievers"] April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; There are no official crowd estimates of events on the Mall.

The second rally, the Reason Rally for 2016, was billed as "a celebration of fact-driven public policy, the value of [[critical thinking]], and the voting power of secular Americans".&lt;ref&gt;[http://reasonrally.org/about/ Speak Up for Reason!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402171445/http://reasonrally.org/about/ |date=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The weekend of the Rally included advocacy events and conference sessions.

==Purpose of the first rally==
According to the first rally's official website, the event had three main goals:&lt;ref name=About /&gt; 
*To encourage attendees (and those who couldn’t attend) to [[coming out|come "out]] of the [[closeted|closet]]" as secular Americans, or supporters of secular equality.
*To dispel stereotypes ("there is no one 'True Atheist' "). Participation by [[nontheism|non-theists]] of all political persuasions, ethnicities, genders, and backgrounds was encouraged. The intent was to show that there are secular Americans in every major demographic.
*Legislative equality. Secular Americans should be permitted to run for public office and adequately represent non-theists, just as theists in office represent their constituents. Non-theists deserve a seat at the table just as theists do; the rally should put secular values "on the radar" of American voters.

Organizers said the aim of the rally was twofold: to unite individuals with similar beliefs and to show the American public that the number of people who don’t believe in God is large and growing. “We have the numbers to be taken seriously,” said Paul Fidalgo, spokesman for the [[Center for Inquiry]], which promotes the [[scientific method]] and reasoning and was one of the organizations sponsoring the rally. “We’re not just a tiny fringe group.”&lt;ref name=Washington&gt;{{cite news|last=Aratani|first=Lori|title=Atheists, others gather at Reason Rally|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/atheists-others-to-gather-at-reason-rally/2012/03/23/gIQAvqY2WS_story.html|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=''[[The Washington Post]]''|date=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to rally spokesman [[Jesse Galef]], diversity with the attendees was a focus this year, he stated 'We can't succeed if we are only coming from one demographic'". Comparing the 2012 rally to the 2002 Godless rally which was mainly over-40 white men, the attendees were "largely under the age of 30, at least half female and included many people of color".&lt;ref name=winston&gt;{{cite news|last=Winston|first=Kimberly|title=Atheists Rally On National Mall; The 'Reason Rally' Largest Gathering Of Nonbelievers (PHOTOS)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/24/atheist-rally_n_1377443.html#s811235&amp;title=Reason_Rally_on|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=2012-05-02|date=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to [[NPR]] prior to the rally, American Atheist president [[David Silverman (activist)|David Silverman]] stated that this is a coming-of-age event for atheists, "We'll look back at the Reason Rally as one of the game-changing events when people started to look at atheism and look at atheists in a different light".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hagerty|first=Barbara|title='Woodstock For Atheists': A Moment For Nonbelievers|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/23/149021993/woodstock-for-atheists-a-moment-for-nonbelievers|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With goals of bringing unity, energy, and visibility to the secular demographic, the rally can be seen as a manifestation of the [[secular movement]] that emerged in America and elsewhere in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' Sarah Posner states that the Reason Rally was modeled on the LGBT movement, encouraging people to 'come out' about their non-belief and working to humanize atheism by getting "people to personalize someone they'd always thought of as an 'other.'" Once people realize that their neighbor, co-worker or family member is an atheist it goes a long way towards acceptance.  Politics played a large part of the Rally according to Posner; considering that there is only one openly atheist American Congressperson, there is a lot of work to still be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Posner|first=Sarah|title=''Can the Reason Rally resonate in this most religious of democracies?''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/26/reason-rally-resonate-religious-democracy|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=2012-05-03|location=London|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support of the first rally===
In the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', Staks Rosch praised the rally. He stated that atheists "face a great deal of discrimination and fear of discrimination for being outspoken" and that many "fear having their families disown them, losing their jobs, or simply being harassed by the religious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/staks-rosch/why-the-reason-rally-is-w_b_1326705.html | title=Why The Reason Rally is Worth Coming Out For | author=Staks Rosch | publisher=Huffington Post | date=March 8, 2012 | accessdate=March 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Niose]], the president of the [[American Humanist Association]] stated that "The secular demographic does not claim to have a monopoly on rationality, but it does feel that it has something to offer. By rallying in Washington, seculars are not whining about some imagined victimization, but rather they are exercising a voice that has been silenced for too long."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wednesday, April 7, 2010 as of 11:14 AM ET |url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/03/24/reason-rally-is-coming-out-party-for-secular-movement/ |title=Reason Rally is a coming out party for the secular movement |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=2010-04-07 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nathan Phelps|Nate Phelps]], an atheist and estranged son of [[Fred Phelps]], the founder of the fringe group, [[Westboro Baptist Church]], supported the Reason Rally and was among the event's speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/15/10706741-westboro-church-pastors-son-to-face-off-against-dads-picketers-at-atheist-rally | title=Westboro church pastor's son to face off against dad's picketers at atheist rally | publisher=msnbc.com | date=March 15, 2012 | accessdate=March 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/15/nate-phelps-westboro-baptist-church_n_1348861.html | title=Nate Phelps, Son Of Westboro Baptist Church Pastor, To Speak At Reason Rally | publisher=Huffington Post | date=March 15, 2012 | accessdate=March 17, 2012 | first=Simon | last=McCormack}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/westboro-to-protest-reason-rally-where-phelps-atheist-son-will-speak-71594/ | title=Westboro to Protest 'Reason Rally' Where Phelps' Atheist Son Will Speak | publisher=The Christian Post | date=March 16, 2012 | accessdate=March 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the first rally===
The Reason Rally elicited criticism for the anti-theist rhetoric and tone that some speakers employed, since its purpose is to reject religion and superstitions, in favor of employing reason and promoting a secular lifestyle. Editorial writers including Nathalie Rothschild,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathalie-rothschild/why-the-reason-rally-isnt_b_1320748.html | title=Why The Reason Rally Isn't Worth Coming Out For | author=Nathalie Rothschild | publisher=Huffington Post | date=March 5, 2012 | accessdate=March 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tom Gilson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/guest-voices/post/atheists-dont-own-reason/2012/03/21/gIQA4JWUSS_blog.html| title=Atheists don’t own reason | publisher=The Washington Post | date=March 21, 2012 | first=Tom | last=Gilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and representatives of various religious communities such as  [[Rabbi Brad Hirschfield]] of the [[National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership]]&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/03/24/why-reason-rally-is-unreasonable/| title=Why the Reason Rally is unreasonable| publisher=Fox News | date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Anthony Donohue]] of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]]&lt;ref name=League&gt;{{cite web| title = Atheist Rally Draws Haters| url = http://www.catholicleague.org/atheist-rally-draws-haters/|publisher=Catholic League|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; all voiced disapproval.

==Notable speaker quotes of the first rally==
*Rally host [[Paul Provenza]] addressed the issue of "anti-religiosity" in his opening announcement, saying: “We're not here today to bash anyone's religion… but, hey, if it happens it happens.”&lt;ref&gt;Rosenhouse, Jason, [http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2012/03/at_the_reason_rally.php “At the Reason Rally”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331085611/http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2012/03/at_the_reason_rally.php |date=2012-03-31 }}, EvolutionBlog, March 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Keynote speaker [[Richard Dawkins]] spoke about the differences between the US and the UK, which does not have separation between church and state.  "The American Constitution is a precious treasure, the envy of the world".  He praised the size of the crowd at the rally calling it a "magnificent and inspiring sight". He said he believes that this rally, in hindsight, will be seen as a tipping point that is "not far away" when "so many people will have come out [as atheists] that 'I can come out too'... we are far more numerous than anybody realizes." Reason to Dawkins means "basing your life on evidence and on logic, which is how you deduce the consequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=Richard Dawkins - Reason Rally 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9UKTuuTHEg|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He encouraged attendees to confront believers regarding what he called their "most absurd" beliefs (e.g., [[transsubstantiation]]), stating: "Mock them, ridicule them in public. Don't fall for the convention that we're all too polite to talk about religion. Religion makes specific claims about the Universe which need to be substantiated and challenged."&lt;ref name="League"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haggerty&gt;{{cite news| last = Haggerty| first = John | title = Letters: Mockery hurts understanding of religion| url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/letters/story/2012-03-27/reason-rally-atheists/53812948/1|publisher=USA Today| date=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kwon&gt;{{cite web| last =  Kwon| first = Lillian| title = Atheists Rally for Reason; Urged to Mock the Religious|year = 2012| url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/atheists-rally-for-reason-urged-to-mock-the-religious-72033/|accessdate =March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =  Grossman| first = Cathy| title = Richard Dawkins to atheist rally: 'Show contempt' for faith| url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2012/03/-atheists-richard-dawkins-reason-rally/1#.T29HTWFv8Ro|publisher=USA Today|accessdate =March 25, 2012| date=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Mythbuster]]'' [[Adam Savage]] stated "I play a scientist on TV; I am in awe of those that do it for real." He discusses science and reason by saying "Everything that we have that makes our lives possible exists because human beings have... made predictions based on those tests and then improved upon them. This is reason: the human capacity to make sense of the world." He concluded "through careful empirical analysis and much thought that someone is looking out for me... I have concluded that this person keeping score - is me."&lt;ref name="5//1/2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Savage|first=Adam|authorlink=Adam Savage|title=Adam Savage at the Reason Rally|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1nSuWztIrY}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Provenza, introducing [[Ahlquist v. Cranston|Jessica Ahlquist]], stated that "for standing up for her beliefs and rights under the Constitution ... [she has] suffered a lot of hate." Ahlquist's speech thanked the atheist community for its support for her.  She felt that students are a really important part of this movement. "What I did can be done by anybody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahlquist|first=Jessica|title=Jessica Ahlquist at Reason Rally|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G__Yo6vTiw|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Blogger [[Greta Christina]], author of ''Why Are You Atheists So Angry?: 99 Things That Piss Off the Godless'', gave an abbreviated list of things she was angry about, concluding "Atheists aren't angry because we're selfish, or bitter, or joyless. Atheists are angry because we have compassion. Atheists are angry because we have a sense of justice. Atheists are angry because we see millions of people being terribly harmed by religion, and our hearts go out to them, and we feel motivated to do something about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greta Christina|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9Up_Beqmq4|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[David Silverman (activist)|David Silverman]], president of [[American Atheists]], encouraged atheists to come out of the closet to reduce atheophobia: "If the atheists weren't closeted, it would be harder to hate us, because in the end, you can't hate what you already love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reason Rally - March 24, 2012 Washington DC (highlights from Rally) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGBBiFxD2pc|accessdate = 2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Magician [[Penn Jillette]], speaking via pre-recorded video, stated "I can make the argument...that the only ones with true morality are us, the atheists. We are doing good because it's good and are doing right because it's right, and not for reward or punishment.  We have love for each other, we have community, we have charity." Jillette told the audience to "band together and make it okay to be an atheist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jillette|first=Penn|title=Penn Jillette Reason Rally Address|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rudd6Dzp9eI|accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bill Maher]], speaking remotely, said, "When it comes to religion, we're not two sides of the same coin, and you don't get to put your unreason upon the same shelf with my reason. Your stuff [religion] has to go over there, on the shelf with [[Zeus]], and [[Thor]], and the [[Kraken]]. With the stuff that is not evidence based, stuff that religious people never change their mind about, no matter what happens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maher|first=Bill|title=Bill Maher at the Reason Rally 3/24/12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHtaiuJc0KM|accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 rally (the second rally)==
The second quadrennial '''Reason Rally''' was held on June 4, 2016 at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].

The Reason Rally for 2016 was billed as "a celebration of fact-driven public policy, the value of [[critical thinking]], and the voting power of secular Americans".&lt;ref&gt;[http://reasonrally.org/about/ Speak Up for Reason!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402171445/http://reasonrally.org/about/ |date=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The weekend of the Rally included advocacy events and conference sessions.

Event organizers were targeting an attendance of 30,000, but crowds proved much smaller; sources disagree on the exact attendance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}.

'''Subjective well-being''' ('''SWB''') is a self-reported measure of [[well-being]], typically obtained by questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oecd.org/site/worldforum06/38331839.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160107223341/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/well-being/publications/measuring-subjective-well-being-in-the-uk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ed Diener]] developed a tripartite model of subjective well-being in 1984, which describes how people experience the [[quality of life|quality of their lives]] and includes both [[emotion]]al reactions and [[cognitive]] judgments.&lt;ref name="Diener1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed| title= Subjective well-being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year= 1984|volume= 95|pages=542–575|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/95/3/542/|issue=3|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.95.3.542|pmid= 6399758}}&lt;/ref&gt; It posits "three distinct but often related components of wellbeing: frequent positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]], infrequent negative [[affect (psychology)|affect]], and cognitive evaluations such as [[life satisfaction]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tov &amp; Diener (2013), ''Subjective Well-Being''. Research Collection School of Social Sciences. Paper 1395. http://ink.library.sju.edu.sg/soss_research/1395&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49658154_A_Review_of_the_Tripartite_Structure_of_Subjective_Well-Being_Implications_for_Conceptualization_Operationalization_Analysis_and_Synthesis&lt;/ref&gt;

SWB therefore encompasses [[mood (psychology)|moods]] and emotions as well as evaluations of one's satisfaction with general and specific areas of one's life.&lt;ref name=Diener1999&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed |author2=Suh, E.M. |author3=Lucas, R.E. |author4=Smith, H.L|title=Subjective well-being: Three Decades of Progress|journal= Psychological Bulletin |year=1999|volume=125|pages=276–302|url =http://stat.psych.uiuc.edu/~ediener/Documents/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276|issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts encompassed by SWB include [[happiness]]. 

SWB tends to be stable over time&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; and is strongly related to [[personality psychology|personality traits]].&lt;ref name=Steel&gt;{{cite journal|last= Steel|first=Piers |author2=Schmidt, Joseph |author3=Shultz, Jonas|title=Refining the relationship between personality and Subjective well-being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2008|volume=134|pages=138–161|url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y4person/3_happiness/Steel2008_5FM_and_happiness_psych_bull.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.134.1.138|pmid= 18193998|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that health and SWB may mutually influence each other, as good health tends to be associated with greater happiness,&lt;ref name=Okunmeta-analysis/&gt; and a number of studies have found that positive emotions and [[optimism]] can have a beneficial influence on health.&lt;ref name=Dienerhealth/&gt;

==Construction of SWB==
[[Ed Diener|Diener]] et al.  argued that the various components of SWB represent distinct constructs that need to be understood separately, even though they are closely related. Hence, SWB may be considered "a general area of scientific interest rather than a single specific construct".&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Due to the specific focus on the ''subjective'' aspects of well-being, definitions of SWB typically exclude ''objective'' conditions such as material conditions or [[health]], although these can influence ratings of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt; Definitions of SWB therefore focus on how a person evaluates his/her own life, including emotional experiences of [[pleasure]] versus [[suffering|pain]] in response to specific events and cognitive evaluations of what a person considers a [[Eudaimonia|good life]].&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; Components of SWB relating to [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] include positive affect (experiencing pleasant emotions and moods) and low negative affect (experiencing unpleasant, distressing emotions and moods), as well as "overall affect" or "[[valence (psychology)|hedonic]] balance", defined as the overall equilibrium  between positive and negative affect, and usually measured as the difference between the two.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;  High positive affect and low negative affect are often highly correlated, but not always.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt;

==Components of SWB==
There are two components of SWB. One is [[affect (psychology)|Affective Balance]] and the other is Life Satisfaction. An individual's scores on the two measures are summed to produce a total SWB score. In some cases, these scores are kept separate.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;
* Affective balance
Affective balance refers to the emotions, moods, and feelings a person has. These can be all positive, all negative, or a combination of both positive and negative.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt; Some research shows also that feelings of reward are separate from positive and negative affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = M | last2 = Dolan | first2 = P | year = 2009 | title = Accounting for the richness of our daily activities | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02392.x | pmid = 19549079 | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 8| pages = 1000–1008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Life satisfaction
[[Life satisfaction]] (global judgments of one's life) and satisfaction with specific life domains (e.g. work satisfaction) are considered cognitive components of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; The term "[[happiness]]" is also commonly used in regards to SWB and has been defined variously as "satisfaction of desires and goals" (therefore related to life satisfaction), as a "preponderance of positive over negative affect" (therefore related to emotional components of SWB),&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt; as "contentment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a "consistent, [[optimistic]] mood state"&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; and may imply an affective evaluation of one's life as a whole.&lt;ref name=deneve&amp;cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M.|author2=Cooper, Harris |title=The Happy Personality: A Meta-Analysis of 137 Personality Traits and Subjective Well-Being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1998|volume=124|pages=197–229|url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y5_ID/personality/wellbeing/1998_Deneve_cooper_psych_bull.pdf|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.197|pmid=9747186|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Life satisfaction can also be known as the "stable" component in one's life.&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt;  Affective concepts of SWB can be considered in terms of momentary emotional states as well as in terms of longer-term moods and tendencies (i.e. how much positive and/or negative affect a person generally experiences over any given period of time).&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Life satisfaction and in some research happiness are typically considered over long durations, up to one's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; "[[Quality of life]]" has also been studied as a conceptualization of SWB. Although its exact definition varies, it is usually measured as an aggregation of well-being across several life domains and may include both subjective and objective components.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;

===Measurement of SWB components===

Life satisfaction and Affect balance are generally measured separately and independently.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  
* Life satisfaction is generally measured using a self-report method. A common measurement for life satisfaction is questionnaires. 
* Affective balance is also generally measured using a self-report method. An example of a measurement of affective balance is the [[Positive and Negative Affect Schedule|PANAS]] (Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule).&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  
Sometimes a single SWB question attempts to capture an overall picture.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. "''The most basic way of measuring it involves asking individuals how they feel about their lives - known as subjective well being. A typical question is, "Taking all things together, how happy are you?" - with possible answers from 0 (extremely unhappy) to 10 (extremely happy).''" Can Happiness be Measured?, http://www.actionforhappiness.org/why-happiness&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue with the such measurements of life satisfaction and affective balance is that they are self-reports. The problem with self-reports is that the participants may be lying or at least not telling the whole truth on the questionnaires. Participants may be lying or holding back from revealing certain things because they are either embarrassed or they may be filling in what they believe the researcher wants to see in the results. To gain more accurate results, other methods of measurement have been used to determine one’s SWB. 

Another way to corroborate or confirm that the self-report results are accurate is through informant reports.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  Informant reports are given to the participant’s closest friends and family and they are asked to fill out either a survey or a form asking about the participants mood, emotions, and overall lifestyle. The participant may write in the self-report that they are very happy, however that participant’s friends and family record that he/she is always depressed. This would obviously be a contradiction in results which would ultimately lead to inaccurate results. 

Another method of gaining a better understanding of the true results is through ESM, or the Experience Sampling Method.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  In this measure, participants are given a beeper/pager that will randomly ring throughout the day. Whenever the beeper/pager sounds, the participant will stop what he/she is doing and record the activity they are currently engaged in and their current mood and feelings. Tracking this over a period of a week or a month will give researchers a better understanding of the true emotions, moods, and feelings the participant is experiencing, and how these factors interact with other thoughts and behaviors.&lt;ref name= HGIN&gt;{{cite journal |author1=van der Krieke et al., L. | year = 2015 | title = HowNutsAreTheDutch (HoeGekIsNL): A crowdsourcing study of mental symptoms and strengths | journal = International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research | volume = 25| issue = 2| pages = 123–44| doi=10.1002/mpr.1495 | pmid=26395198}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third measurement to ensure validity is the Day Reconstruction Method.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  In this measure, participants fill out a diary of the previous days’ activities. The participant is then asked to describe each activity and provide a report of how they were feeling, what mood they were experiencing, and any emotions that surfaced. Thus to ensure valid results, a researcher may tend to use self-reports along with another form of measurement mentioned above. Someone with a high level of life satisfaction and a positive affective balance is said to have a high level of SWB.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;

==Theories==
Theories of the causes of SWB tend to emphasise either top-down or bottom-up influences.&lt;ref name="Diener1984"/&gt;

===Top-down perspective===

In the top-down view, global features of personality influence the way a person perceives events. Individuals may therefore have a global tendency to perceive life in a consistently positive or negative manner, depending on their stable personality traits.&lt;ref name=deneve1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M. |title=Happy as an Extraverted Clam? The Role of Personality for Subjective Well-Being
|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science
|year=1999|volume=8|pages=141–144|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/8/5/141.abstract|issue=5|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Top-down theories of SWB suggest that people have a [[genetic predisposition]] to be happy or unhappy and this predisposition determines their SWB "setpoint". Set Point theory implies that a person's baseline or equilibrium level of SWB is a consequence of hereditary characteristics and therefore, almost entirely predetermined at birth.&lt;ref name="Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lykken|author2=Tellegen |title=Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon|journal=Psychological Science|year=1996|volume=7|issue=3|doi= 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x |url=http://www.theiahe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Happiness-is-a-Stochastic-Phenomenon.-by-David-Lykken-and-Auke-Tellegen.-APS.-May-1996.pdf|first1=David|pages=186–189 |citeseerx=10.1.1.613.4004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence for this genetic predisposition derives from behavior-genetic studies that have found that positive and negative affectivity each have high [[heritability]] (40% and 55% respectively in one study).&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Numerous twin studies confirm the notion of set point theory, however, they do not rule out the possibility that is it possible for individuals to experience long term changes in SWB.&lt;ref name="Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Matt |last=McGue |author2=Bacon, Steve |author3=Lykken, David|title=Personality stability and change in early adulthood: A behavioral genetic analysis|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1993|volume=29|issue=1|pages=96–109 |url =  http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/Personality_McGue01.pdf|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.29.1.96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diener et al. note that heritability studies are limited in that they describe long-term SWB in a sample of people in a modern [[western society]] but may not be applicable to more extreme environments that might influence SWB and do not provide absolute indicators of genetic effects. Additionally, heritability estimates are inconsistent across studies.

Further evidence for a genetically influenced predisposition to SWB comes from findings that personality has a large influence on long-term SWB. This has led to the ''dynamic equilibrium model'' of SWB. This model proposes that personality provides a baseline for emotional responses. External events may move people away from the baseline, sometimes dramatically, but these movements tend to be of limited duration, with most people returning to their baseline eventually.&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt;

===Bottom-up perspective===

From a bottom-up perspective, happiness represents an accumulation of happy experiences. Bottom-up influences include external events, and broad situational and demographic factors, including health and marital status. Bottom-up approaches are based on the idea that there are universal [[basic human needs]] and that happiness results from their fulfilment. In support of this view, there is evidence that daily pleasurable events are associated with increased positive affect, and daily unpleasant events or hassles are associated with increased negative affect.

However, research suggests that external events account for a much smaller proportion of the variance in self-reports of SWB than top-down factors, such as personality.&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; A theory proposed to explain the limited impact of external events on SWB is hedonic adaptation.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; Based originally on the concept of a "[[hedonic treadmill]]", this theory proposes that positive or negative external events temporarily increase or decrease feelings of SWB, but as time passes people tend to become habituated to their circumstances and have a tendency to return to a personal SWB "setpoint" or baseline level.

The hedonic treadmill theory originally proposed that most people return to a neutral level of SWB (i.e. neither happy nor unhappy) as they habituate to events. However, subsequent research has shown that for most people, the baseline level of SWB is at least mildly positive, as most people tend to report being at least somewhat happy in general and tend to experience positive mood when no adverse events are occurring. Additional refinements to this theory have shown that people do not adapt to all life events equally, as people tend to adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. the death of a loved one), and not at all to others (e.g. noise and sex).&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt;

==Factors affecting SWB==

===Personality and genetics===
A number of studies have found that SWB constructs are strongly associated with a range of personality traits, including those in the [[five factor model]].&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; Findings from numerous personality studies show that genetics account for 20-48% of the variance in Five-Factor Model and the variance in subjective well-being is also heritable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bouchard | first = Thomas J., Jr. |author2=Loehlin, J.C.  | year = 2001 | title = Genes, evolution, and personality | journal = Behavior Genetics | volume = 31 | pages = 243–273 | doi =  10.1023/A:1012294324713 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/qt0138g23w8720j1/ | issue = 3 | pmid = 11699599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[neuroticism]] predicts poorer subjective well-being whilst [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[conscientiousness]] and [[openness to experience]] tend to predict higher subjective well-being. A [[meta-analysis]] found that neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were significantly related to all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;

A large number of personality traits are related to SWB constructs, although [[intelligence]] has negligible relationships.&lt;ref name=deneve&amp;cooper/&gt; Positive affect is most strongly predicted by extraversion, to a lesser extent agreeableness, and more weakly by openness to experience. Happiness was most strongly predicted by extraversion, and also strongly predicted by neuroticism, and to a lesser extent by the other three factors. Life satisfaction was significantly predicted by neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Quality of life was very strongly predicted by neuroticism, and also strongly predicted by extraversion and conscientiousness, and to a modest extent by agreeableness and openness to experience.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;   One study found that subjective well-being was genetically indistinct from personality traits, especially those that reflected emotional stability (low Neuroticism), and social and physical activity (high Extraversion), and constraint (high Conscientiousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weiss | first = A. |author2=Bates, T. C. |author3=Luciano, M.  |year = 2008 | title = Happiness is a personal(ity) thing: The genetics of personality and well-being in a representative sample |journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 |pages = 205–210 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02068.x | pmid = 18315789 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeNeve (1999) argued that there are three trends in the relationship between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies ([[neuroticism#Emotional stability|emotional stability]], positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an [[optimistic]] fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being.&lt;ref name=deneve1999/&gt;

The related trait of [[eudaimonia]] or [[psychological well-being]], is also heritable. Evidence from one study supports 5 independent genetic mechanisms underlying the Ryff facets of psychological well-being, leading to a genetic construct of eudaimonia in terms of general [[self-control]], and four subsidiary biological mechanisms enabling the psychological capabilities of purpose, agency, growth, and positive social relations&lt;ref name=Archontaki2012&gt;D.

===Social influences===
{{expand section|date=December 2012}}
A person's level of subjective well-being is determined by many different factors and social influences prove to be a strong one. Results from the famous [[Framingham Heart Study]] indicate that friends three [[degrees of separation]] away (that is, friends of friends of friends) can affect a person's happiness. From abstract: "A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fowler|first=J. H|author2=Christakis, N.

===Wealth===
Research indicates that wealth is related to many positive outcomes in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furnham &amp; Argyle|title=The psychology of money|year=1998|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such outcomes include: improved health and mental health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langner &amp; Michael|title=Life stress and mental health: The Midtown Manhattan study|year=1963|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe  (New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt; greater longevity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|title=Unhealthy societies: the afflictions of inequality|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; lower rates of infant mortality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith |author2=Eikeseth |author3=Klevstrand |author4=Lovaas |title=Intensive behavioral treatment for preschoolers with severe mental retardation and pervasive developmental disorder|journal=American Journal on Mental Retardation|year=1997|volume=102|issue=3|pages=238–249|doi=10.1352/0895-8017(1997)102&lt;0238:IBTFPW&gt;2.0.CO;2|pmid=9394133|first1=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; experience fewer stressful life events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = RM | last2 = Runciman | first2 = WB | last3 = Gibberd | first3 = RW | last4 = Harrison | first4 = BT | last5 = Newby | first5 = L | last6 = Hamilton | first6 = JD.  | year = 1995 | title = The quality in Australian health care study | url = | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 163 | issue = | pages = 458–471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and less frequently the victims of violent crimes&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J.

New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; However, research suggests that wealth has a smaller impact on SWB than people generally think, even though higher incomes do correlate substantially with life satisfaction reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aknin|author2=Norton, Dunn |title=From wealth to well-being? Money matters, but less than people think|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|year=2009|volume=4|issue=6|pages=523–527|doi=10.1080/17439760903271421|first1=Lara B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative influence of [[wealth]] together with other material components on overall subjective [[well-being]] of a person is being studied through new researches. The Well-being Project at Human Science Lab investigates how material [[well-being]] and [[perceptual]] well-being works as relative determinants in conditioning our [[mind]] for positive [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk| title=Understanding Positive Emotions |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study done by Aknin, Norton, &amp; Dunn (2009), researchers asked participants from across the income spectrum to report their own happiness and to predict the happiness of others and themselves at different income levels.  In study 1, predicted happiness ranged between 2.4-7.9 and actual happiness ranged between 5.2-7.7.  In study 2, predicted happiness ranged between 15-80 and actual happiness ranged between 50-80.  These findings show that people believe that money does more for happiness than it really does.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, M.I., Dunn, E.W., &amp; *Aknin, L.B. (2009). From wealth to well-being: Spending money on others promotes happiness. Invited talk at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Tampa, FL&lt;/ref&gt; However, some research indicates that while [[socioeconomic]] measures of status do not correspond to greater happiness, measures of [[sociometric status]] (status compared to people encountered face-to-face on a daily basis) do correlate to increased subjective well-being, above and beyond the effects of extroversion and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=C.|author2=Kraus, M. W. |author3=Galinsky, A. D. |author4= Keltner, D. |title=The Local-Ladder Effect: Social Status and Subjective Well-Being|journal=Psychological Science|date=31 May 2012|volume=23|issue=7|pages=764–771|doi=10.1177/0956797611434537 |pmid=22653798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Easterlin Paradox also suggests that there is no connection between a society's [[economic]] development and its average level of [[happiness]].   Through time, the Easterlin has looked at the relationship between [[happiness]] and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across countries and within countries.  There are three different phenomena to look at when examining the connection between money and Subjective well-being; rising GDP within a country, relative income within a country, and differences in GDP between countries.&lt;ref&gt;Easterlin,  Richard  A.,  1973,  Does  Money  Buy  Happiness?  The  Public  Interest,  30  (Winter),  3-10&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, when making comparisons between countries, a principle called the Diminishing Marginal Utility of Income (DMUI) stands strong.  Veenhoven (1991) said, "[W]e not only see a clear positive relationship [between happiness and GNP per capita], but also a curvilinear pattern; which suggest that wealth is subject to a law of diminishing happiness returns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Veenhoven | first1 = Ruut | year = 1991 | title = Is Happiness Relative? | url = http://repub.eur.nl/pub/16148| journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 1–34 | doi=10.1007/bf00292648| format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meaning a $1,000 increase in real income, becomes progressively smaller the higher the initial level of income, having less of an impact on subjective well-being. Easterlin (1995) proved that the DMUI is true when comparing countries, but not when looking at rising gross domestic product within countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Easterlin | first1 = Richard A. | year = 1995 | title = Will Raising the Incomes of All Increase the Happiness of All? | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 35–48 | doi=10.1016/0167-2681(95)00003-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
There are substantial positive associations between [[health]] and SWB so that people who rate their general health as "good" or "excellent" tend to experience better SWB compared to those who rate their health as "fair" or "poor". A meta-analysis found that self-ratings of general health were more strongly related to SWB than physician ratings of health.&lt;ref name=Okunmeta-analysis&gt;

A review of longitudinal studies found&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt; that measures of baseline subjective well-being constructs such as [[optimism]] and positive affect predicted longer-term health status and mortality. Conversely, a number of studies found that baseline [[depression (mood)|depression]] predicted poorer longer-term health status and mortality. Baseline health may well have a causal influence on subjective well-being so causality is difficult to establish.
A number of studies found that positive emotions and optimism had a beneficial impact on cardiovascular health and on immune functioning. Changes in mood are also known to be associated with changes in immune and cardiovascular response.
There is evidence that interventions that are successful in improving subjective well-being can have beneficial effects on aspects of health. For example, [[meditation]] and [[relaxation training]] have been found to increase positive affect and to reduce blood pressure. The effect of specific types of subjective well-being is not entirely clear. For example, how durable the effects of mood and emotions on health are  remains unclear. Whether some types of subjective well-being predict health independently of others is also unclear.&lt;ref name=Dienerhealth/&gt; Meditation has the power to increase happiness because it can improve self-confidence and reduces anxiety, which increases your well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Howard|title=The Pursuit of Happiness|year=1953|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivating personal strengths and resources, like humour, social/animal company, and daily occupations, also appears to help people preserve acceptable levels of SWB despite the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.&lt;ref name="BosPrSWB" /&gt;

Research suggests that probing a patient's happiness is one of the most important things a doctor can do to predict that patient's health and longevity.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  In health-conscious modern societies, most people overlook the emotions as a vital component of one's health, while over focusing on diet and exercise. According to Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener, people who are happy become less sick than people who are unhappy. There are three types of health: morbidity, survival, and longevity.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Evidence suggests that all three can be improved through happiness:

# Morbidity, simply put, is whether or not someone develops a serious illness, such as the flu or cancer.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  In a 30-year longitudinal study, participants who were high in positive emotions were found to have lower rates of many health problems. Some of these illnesses/problems include lower death rates from heart disease, suicide, accidents, homicides, mental illnesses, drug dependency, and liver disease related to alcoholism.  Additionally, results showed that depressed participants were more likely to have heart attacks and recurrences of heart attacks when compared to happy people.
# Survival is the term used for what happens to a person after he/she has already developed or contracted a serious illness.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Although happiness has been shown to increase health, with survival, this may not be the case. Survival may be the only area of health that evidence suggests happiness may actually be sometimes detrimental. It is unclear why exactly research results suggest this is the case, however Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener offer an explanation. It is possible that happy people fail to report symptoms of the illness, which can ultimately lead to no treatment or inadequate treatment. Another possible reason may be that happy people tend to be optimistic, leading them to take their symptoms too lightly, seek treatment too late, and/or follow the doctor’s instructions half-heartedly. And lastly, Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener suggest that people with serious illnesses may be more likely to choose to live out the rest of their days without painful or invasive treatments.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;
# Longevity, the third area of health, is measured by an individual's age of death.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Head researcher Deborah Danner of the University of Kentucky researched links between an individual's happiness and that individual's longevity. Danner recruited 180 Catholic nuns from a nearby convent as the participants of her study. She chose nuns because they live very similar lives. This eliminates many confounding variables that might be present in other samples, which can lead to inaccurate results. Such confounding variables could include drug use, alcohol abuse, diet, and sexual risk-taking. Since there are few differences among the nuns as far as the confounding variables, this sample offered the best option to match a controlled laboratory setting. Results showed that nuns who were considered{{by whom|date=September 2014}} happy or positive in their manner and language on average lived 10 years longer than the nuns who were considered unhappy or negative in their manner and language. A follow-up study by health researcher Sarah Pressman examined 96 famous psychologists to determine if similar results from the nun research would be seen as well. Pressman's results showed that the positive or happy psychologists lived, on average, 6 years longer. The psychologists who were considered{{by whom|date=September 2014}} negative or unhappy lived, on average, 5 years less.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;

===Physical characteristics===
A positive relationship has been found between the volume of gray matter in the right [[precuneus]] area of the brain, and the subject's subjective happiness score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16891 | doi=10.1038/srep16891| pmid=26586449| pmc=4653620| title=The structural neural substrate of subjective happiness| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=5| pages=16891| year=2015| last1=Sato| first1=Wataru| last2=Kochiyama| first2=Takanori| last3=Uono| first3=Shota| last4=Kubota| first4=Yasutaka| last5=Sawada| first5=Reiko| last6=Yoshimura| first6=Sayaka| last7=Toichi| first7=Motomi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 6 week [[mindfulness]] based intervention was found to correlate with a significant gray matter increase within the precuneus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 4306280 | pmid=25632405 | doi=10.17140/NOJ-1-106 | volume=1 | issue=1 | title=Brain Gray Matter Changes Associated with Mindfulness Meditation in Older Adults: An Exploratory Pilot Study using Voxel-based Morphometry | year=2014 | journal=Neuro | pages=23–26 | last1 = Kurth | first1 = F | last2 = Luders | first2 = E | last3 = Wu | first3 = B | last4 = Black | first4 = DS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure===
There are a number of domains that are thought to contribute to subjective well-being. In a study by Hribernik and Mussap (2010), leisure satisfaction was found to predict unique variance in life satisfaction, supporting its inclusion as a distinct life domain contributing to subjective well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hribernik | first1 = J. | last2 = Mussap | first2 = A. J. | year = 2010 | title = Research note: Leisure satisfaction and subjective well-being | url = | journal = Annals of Leisure Research | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 701–708 | doi=10.1080/11745398.2010.9686871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, relationship status interacted with age group and gender on differences in leisure satisfaction. The relationship between leisure satisfaction and life satisfaction, however, was reduced when considering the impact of core affect (underlying mood state). This suggests that leisure satisfaction may primarily be influenced by an individual's subjective well-being level as represented by core affect. This has implications for possible limitations in the extent to which leisure satisfaction may be improved beyond pre-existing levels of well-being and mood in individuals.

===Cultural variations===

Although all cultures seem to value happiness, cultures vary in how they define happiness. There is also evidence that people in more individualistic cultures tend to rate themselves as higher in subjective well-being compared to people in more collectivistic cultures.&lt;ref name=science&gt;
{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western culture]]s, predictors of happiness include elements that support personal independence, a sense of personal agency, and self-expression. In [[Eastern culture]]s, predictors of happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example).&lt;ref name=science/&gt; There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, a sense of personal control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, this is not to say that these things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on{{vague|date=September 2014}} are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

A large body of research evidence has confirmed that people in individualistic societies report higher levels of happiness than people in collectivistic ones and that socioeconomic factors alone are insufficient to explain this difference.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; In addition to political and economic differences, individualistic versus collectivistic nations reliably differ in a variety of psychological characteristics that are related to SWB, such as emotion norms and attitudes to the expression of individual needs. Collectivistic cultures are based around the belief that the individual exists for the benefit of the larger social unit, whereas more individualistic cultures assume the opposite. Collectivistic cultures emphasise maintaining social order and harmony and therefore expect members to suppress their personal desires when necessary in order to promote collective interests. Such cultures therefore consider self-regulation more important than self-expression or than individual rights. Individualistic cultures by contrast emphasise the inalienable value of each person and expect individuals to become self-directive and self-sufficient. Although people in collectivistic cultures may gain happiness from the social approval they receive from suppressing self-interest, research seems to suggest that self-expression produces a greater happiness "payoff" compared to seeking approval outside oneself.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

===Positive psychology===
[[Positive psychology]] is particularly concerned with the study of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener2000&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed| title= Subjective well-being: The Science of Happiness and a Proposal for a National Index|journal=American Psychologist|year=2000|volume=55|pages=34–43|url=http://mina.education.ucsb.edu/janeconoley/ed197/documents/Dienersubjectivewell-being.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.34|pmid= 11392863|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sonja"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyubomirsky|first=Sonja|title=Why are some happier than others?

P.|citeseerx=10.1.1.183.6660 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in positive psychology have pointed out that in almost every [[culture]] studied the pursuit of happiness is regarded as one of the most valued goals in life. Understanding [[individual differences psychology|individual differences]] in SWB is of key interest in positive psychology, particularly the issue of why some people are happier than others. Some people continue to be happy in the face of adversity whereas others are chronically unhappy at the best of times.&lt;ref name=BosPrSWB&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bos, E.H.|author2=Snippe, E.|author3=de Jonge, P.|author4=Jeronimus, B.F.| year = 2016 | title = Preserving Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Psychopathology: Buffering Effects of Personal Strengths and Resources | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = e0150867| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | pmid=26963923|pmc=4786317}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Positive psychology has investigated how people might improve their level of SWB and maintain these improvements over the longer term, rather than returning to baseline.&lt;ref name="Sonja"/&gt; [[Sonja Lyubomirsky|Lyubomirsky]] (2001) argued that SWB is influenced by a combination of personality/genetics (studies have found that genetic influences usually account for 35-50% of the variance in happiness measures), external circumstances, and activities that affect SWB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Røysamb | first1 = E. | last2 = Harris | first2 = J. | last3 = Magnus | first3 = P. | last4 = Vittersø | first4 = J. | last5 = Tambs | first5 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Subjective well-being.

[[File:Happiness pie chart with percentages, based on "How of Happiness" book.png|thumb|According to Sonja Lyubomirsky the determinants of happiness are a combination of a person's genetic set-point, intentional activities and life circumstances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyubomirsky|first=Sonja|title=The How of Happiness: A practical approach to getting the life you want|year=2007|publisher=Sphere|location=Great Britain|isbn=978-1-84744-193-5|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Use in [[Happiness economics]]==
SWB is often used in appraising the wellbeing of populations.&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160107223341/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/well-being/publications/measuring-subjective-well-being-in-the-uk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/researchImpact/caseStudies/layard-happiness-wellbeing-public-policy.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainable markets''' can be loosely defined as those that contribute to stronger livelihoods and more [[sustainable]] environments. In linking with the pursuit of ‘[[sustainable development]]’, such markets have a multiple focus on social, environmental and economic outcomes. Sustainable markets aim to reflect the true costs (or [[externalities]]) of [[natural resource]] [[Environmental degradation|degradation]], [[environmental pollution]], and promote just and [[Occupational safety and health|safe labour]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;Skoll Foundation (2015) ‘Sustainable Markets page’ http://www.skollfoundation.org/issue/sustainable-markets/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key tools ==

In transitioning to sustainable markets, formal rules sometimes called [[market governance mechanism]]s (MGMS)are key potential tools to shape and govern markets. Examples could include Fairtrade certification, sustainable reporting and metrics, payments for [[ecosystem services]] or other market-based instruments. MGMs change the behaviour of consumers, investors or producers so that their decisions result in more sustainable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;IIED Sustainable Markets Group (2011) ‘Research prospectus – Shaping Sustainable Markets’ http://shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/sites/shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/files/20110520%20Research%20prospectus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; MGMs could provide economic signals or incentives, for example in pricing externalities. Regulatory mechanisms could prohibit or require certain practices by consumers or producers. Or cooperative mechanisms could create voluntary or more formal partnerships around environmental norms or standards.

== Debates ==

There are a number of contentious issues and ongoing debates around sustainable markets, particularly in how to achieve sustainable markets. There are questions around the appropriate mix of policy instruments or mechanisms, and for which context. For example, a developing world country may require specific mechanisms to build sustainable markets, particularly where more informal or fledgling economies exist. These also involve wider debates over how economic globalisation and trade can benefit countries where local capacities or institutions are weak.

Furthermore, there are unresolved debates over how much regulation or [[economic interventionism|government intervention]] is appropriate in order to govern sustainable markets. For example, in pricing pollution like [[greenhouse gases]] (GHGs), there are competing arguments over whether there should be government-mandated taxes to limit pollution by economic disincentives or whether a market should determine the price to pollute. In many cases a mixture of both may be favourable.

Broader questions remain over whether sustainable markets can ever fully account for environmental externalities, such as those associated with pollution. This relates to whether an economic model focused on [[GDP]] rather than wellbeing can truly bring about the transformation outlined in sustainable development. There have been suggestions that a move away from a pure focus on GDP is required, towards an emphasis represented in methods such as [[natural capital]] accounting.

== Organizations ==

A number of organizations are working in the sustainable markets field.

* The [[International Institute for Environment and Development]]’s Sustainable Markets Group develops research and analysis towards sustainable markets and the debates and innovations shaping markets.&lt;ref&gt;International Institute for Environment and Development (2015) http://www.iied.org/group/sustainable-markets&lt;/ref&gt; This research also includes a database of market governance mechanisms. 
* The U.S based [[Skoll Foundation]] runs a programme on sustainable markets which focuses on areas such as responsible supply chains, access to finance for sustainable small and medium enterprises including clean energy companies and work on environmental standards and certification.&lt;ref&gt;Skoll Foundation (2015) ‘Sustainable Markets page’ http://www.skollfoundation.org/issue/sustainable-markets/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] runs the Sustainable Markets and Responsible Trade initiative.&lt;ref&gt;International Institute for Sustainable Development (2013) ‘Sustainable Markets and Responsible Trade’ https://www.iisd.org/markets/&lt;/ref&gt; This focuses on the sustainability of international trade and the design and implementation of supply chains. 
* The Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets, based at [[Stockholm School of Economics]], aims to provide policy research and advice to Swedish and international actors. Misum is a cross-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder knowledge center dedicated to sustainability and sustainable markets and contains three research platforms: Sustainability in Financial Markets (Mistra Financial Systems), Sustainability in Production and Consumption and Sustainable Socio-Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets (2015) http://www.hhs.se/misum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mistra.org/forskning/pagaende-forskning/misum---mistra-center-for-sustainable-markets.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30170">[[Victimization]] refers to a person being made into a victim by someone else and can take on psychological as well as physical forms, both of which are damaging to victims.&lt;ref name="number7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Erika|last2=Yoon|first2=Jeungeun|last3=Langer|first3=Amie|last4=Ro|first4=Eunyoe|title=Is Psychological Aggression as Detrimental as Physical Aggression?&lt;BR&gt; The Independent Effects of Psychological Aggression on Depression and Anxiety Symptoms|journal=Violence and Victims|date=1 February 2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=20–35|doi=10.1891/0886-6708.24.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of victimization include (but are not limited to) [[bullying]] or [[peer victimization]], [[physical abuse]], [[sexual abuse]], [[verbal abuse]], [[robbery]], and [[assault]]. Some of these forms of victimization are commonly associated with certain populations, but they can happen to others as well. For example, bullying or peer victimization is most commonly studied in children and adolescents but also takes place between adults.&lt;ref name="number6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aquino|first1=Karl|last2=Douglas|first2=Scott|last3=Martinko|first3=Mark J.|title=Overt Anger in Response to Victimization: Attributional Style and Organizational Norms as Moderators.|journal=Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|date=2004|volume=9|issue=2|pages=152–164|doi=10.1037/1076-8998.9.2.152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although anyone may be victimized, particular groups (e.g. children, the elderly, individuals with disabilities) may be more susceptible to certain types of victimization and as a result to the symptoms and consequences that follow. Individuals respond to victimization in a wide variety of ways, so noticeable '''symptoms of victimization''' will vary from person to person. These symptoms may take on several different forms (e.g. psychological, behavioral, or physical), be associated with specific forms of victimization, and be moderated by individual characteristics of the victim and/or experiences after victimization.

==Categories of outcomes==
Symptoms of victimization may include negative physical, [[psychology|psychological]], or [[behavior]]al consequences that are direct or indirect responses (see physical symptoms section) to victimization experiences. Symptoms in these categories sometimes overlap, are closely related, or cause each other. For example, a behavioral symptom such as an increase in aggressiveness or irritability may be part of a particular psychological outcome such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt; Much of the research on symptoms of victimization is cross-sectional (researchers only collected data at one point in time). From a research perspective this means that the symptoms are associated with victimization, but the causal relationship is not always established and alternative explanations have not been ruled out.&lt;ref name="number1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Juvonen|first1=Jaana|last2=Graham|first2=Sandra|title=Bullying in Schools: The Power of Bullies and the Plight of Victims|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=3 January 2014|volume=65|issue=1|pages=159–185|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115030|pmid=23937767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the symptoms described also may put individuals at risk for victimization. For example, there may be a two-way relationship between victimization and certain internalizing symptoms such as depression or withdrawal, such that victimization increases these symptoms, and individuals exhibiting these symptoms may be targeted for victimization more often than others.&lt;ref name="number2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reijntjes|first1=Albert|last2=Kamphuis|first2=Jan H.|last3=Prinzie|first3=Peter|last4=Telch|first4=Michael J.|title=Peer victimization and internalizing problems in children: A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|date=April 2010|volume=34|issue=4|pages=244–252|doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2009.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
The experience of being victimized may cause an individual to feel vulnerable or helpless, as well as changing their view of the world and/or their self-perception; the psychological distress this causes may manifest in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janoff-Bulman|first1=Ronnie|last2=Frieze|first2=Irene Hanson|title=A Theoretical Perspective for Understanding Reactions to Victimization|journal=Journal of Social Issues|date=July 1983|volume=39|issue=2|pages=1–17|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1983.tb00138.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diagnosable psychological disorders that are associated with victimization experiences include [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). Psychological symptoms that are disruptive to a person's life may be present in some form even if they do not meet diagnostic criteria for a specific disorder. A variety of symptoms such as [[Social withdrawal|withdrawal]], [[avoidance coping|avoidance]], and [[nightmares]], may be part of one of these diagnosable disorders or may occur in milder or more isolated form; diagnoses of particular disorders require that these symptoms have a particular degree of severity or frequency, or that an individual exhibits a certain number of them in order to be formally diagnosed.&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt;

====Depression====

[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] has been found to be associated with many forms of victimization, including sexual victimization, violent crime, property crime, peer victimization, and [[domestic abuse]].&lt;ref name="number3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feiring|first1=Candice|last2=Simon|first2=Valerie A.|last3=Cleland|first3=Charles M.|title=Childhood sexual abuse, stigmatization, internalizing symptoms, and the development of sexual difficulties and dating aggression.|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=2009|volume=77|issue=1|pages=127–137|doi=10.1037/a0013475|pmid=19170459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="number4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herek|first1=Gregory M.|last2=Gillis|first2=J.

====Anxiety====

A connection between victimization and [[anxiety]] has been established for both children and adults.&lt;ref name="context"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellmore|first1=Amy D.|last2=Witkow|first2=Melissa R.|last3=Graham|first3=Sandra|last4=Juvonen|first4=Jaana|title=Beyond the Individual: The Impact of Ethnic Context and Classroom Behavioral Norms on Victims' Adjustment.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2004|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1159–1172|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.6.1159|pmid=15535764}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="help"/&gt; The particular types of anxiety studied in relation to victimization vary; some research references anxiety as a general term while other research references more specific types such as social anxiety.&lt;ref name="context"/&gt; The term anxiety covers a range of difficulties and several specific diagnoses, including panic attacks, phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder.  Panic attacks are relatively short, intense bursts of fear that may or may not have a trigger (a cause in the immediate environment that happens right before they occur). They are sometimes a part of other anxiety disorders. Phobias may be specific to objects, situations, people, or places. They can result in avoidance behaviors or, if avoidance is not possible, extreme anxiety or panic attacks. Generalized anxiety is characterized by long-term, uncontrolled, intense worrying in addition to other symptoms such as irritability, sleep problems, or restlessness.&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt; Anxiety has been shown to disrupt many aspects of people's lives as well, e.g. academic functioning, and to predict worse health outcomes later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Ameringen|first1=Michael|last2=Mancini|first2=Catherine|last3=Farvolden|first3=Peter|title=The impact of anxiety disorders on educational achievement|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|date=January 2003|volume=17|issue=5|pages=561–571|doi=10.1016/S0887-6185(02)00228-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=BARDONE|first1=ANNA M.|last2=MOFFITT|first2=TERRIE E.|last3=CASPI|first3=AVSHALOM|last4=DICKSON|first4=NIGEL|last5=STANTON|first5=WARREN R.|last6=SILVA|first6=PHIL A.|title=Adult Physical Health Outcomes of Adolescent Girls With Conduct Disorder, Depression, and Anxiety|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|date=June 1998|volume=37|issue=6|pages=594–601|doi=10.1097/00004583-199806000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Posttraumatic stress disorder====

[[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) is a specific anxiety disorder in response to a traumatic event in a person's life. It is often discussed in the context of mental health of combat veterans, but also occurs in individuals who have been traumatized in other ways, such as victimization. PTSD involves long-term intense fear, re-experiencing the traumatic event (e.g. nightmares), avoidance of reminders of the event, and being highly reactive (e.g. easily enraged or startled).&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt; It may include feeling detached from other people, self-guilt, and difficulty sleeping. Individuals with PTSD may experience a number of symptoms similar to those experienced in both anxiety and depression.

In addition to the established diagnostic criteria for PTSD, [[Frank Ochberg]] proposed a specific set of victimization symptoms (not formally recognized in diagnostic systems such as the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]]) that includes [[shame]], [[self-blame]], obsessive hatred of the person who victimized them alongside conflicting positive feelings toward that person, feeling defiled, being [[sexually inhibited]], despair or resignation to the situation, secondary victimization (described below), and risk of [[victimisation|revictimization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ochberg|first1=edited by Frank M.|title=Post-traumatic therapy and victims of violence|date=1988|publisher=Brunner/Mazel|location=New York|isbn=0876304900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Additional symptoms of victimization may take on physical or behavioral forms. These may be direct, individual symptoms of victimization, or they may result from the psychological outcomes described above.

====Physical====
The most direct and obvious physical symptoms of victimization are injuries as a result of an aggressive physical action such as assault or sexual victimization. Other physical symptoms that are not a result of injury may be indirectly caused by victimization through psychological or emotional responses. Physical symptoms with a psychological or emotional basis are called [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] symptoms. Common psychosomatic symptoms associated with victimization include headaches, stomachaches and experiencing a higher frequency of illnesses such as colds and sore throats.&lt;ref name="number1"/&gt; Though psychosomatic symptoms are referred to as having psychological causes they have a biological basis as well; stress and other psychological symptoms trigger [[nervous system]] responses such as the release of various chemicals and hormones which then affect biological functioning.&lt;ref name="PTSD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singer|first1=edited by Andrew Baum, Tracey A. Revensen, Jerome|title=Handbook of health psychology|date=2010|publisher=Psychology|location=Hove|isbn=9780805864618|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Behavioral====
Individuals who have been victimized may also exhibit behavioral symptoms after the experience. Some individuals who have been victimized show externalizing (outwardly directed) behaviors. For example, an individual who has not previously acted aggressively toward others may begin to do so as after being victimized, such as when a child who has been bullied begins to bully others. Aggressive behaviors may be associated with PTSD (described above). Externalizing behaviors associated with victimization include hyperactivity, [[hypervigilance]], and attention problems that may resemble [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]].&lt;ref name="number1"/&gt; Others may exhibit internalizing (inwardly directed) behavioral symptoms. Many internalizing symptoms tend to be more psychological in nature (depression and anxiety are sometimes referred to as internalization), but particular behaviors are indicative of internalization as well.&lt;ref name="number2"/&gt; Internalizing behaviors that have been documented in victimized individuals include withdrawing from social contact and avoidance of people or situations.&lt;ref name="number2"/&gt;

====Substance use====
Drug and alcohol use associated with victimization is sometimes explained as a form of [[self-medication]], or an attempt to alleviate other symptoms resulting from victimization through substance use.&lt;ref name="drinking"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaysen|first1=Debra|last2=Atkins|first2=David C.|last3=Simpson|first3=Tracy L.|last4=Stappenbeck|first4=Cynthia A.|last5=Blayney|first5=Jessica A.|last6=Lee|first6=Christine M.|last7=Larimer|first7=Mary E.|title=Proximal relationships between PTSD symptoms and drinking among female college students: Results from a daily monitoring study.|journal=Psychology of Addictive Behaviors|date=2014|volume=28|issue=1|pages=62–73|doi=10.1037/a0033588|pmc=3825767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting this, alcohol use has been empirically connected to particular symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="drinking"/&gt; Sexual abuse in particular has been identified as one significant precursor to serious alcohol use among women, although it is not as well-established as a causal link and may be mediated by PTSD or other psychological symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moncrieff|first1=Joanna|last2=Farmer|first2=Roger|title=Sexual abuse and the subsequent development of alcohol problems|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism|date=1998|volume=33|issue=6|pages=592–601|doi=10.1093/alcalc/33.6.592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connections have been established between victimization and the use of other drugs as well. Drug use in adolescence and peer victimization based on sexual orientation are correlated.&lt;ref name="SOV"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darwich|first1=Lina|last2=Hymel|first2=Shelley|last3=Waterhouse|first3=Terry|title=School avoidance and substance use among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning youths: The impact of peer victimization and adult support.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=2012|volume=104|issue=2|pages=381–392|doi=10.1037/a0026684}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has drawn connections between substance use and childhood physical abuse in the general population.&lt;ref name="Malinosky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malinosky-Rummell|first1=Robin|last2=Hansen|first2=David J.|title=Long-term consequences of childhood physical abuse.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1993|volume=114|issue=1|pages=68–79|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.114.1.68|pmid=8346329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug use has also been connected to both physical and sexual victimization among high risk, incarcerated youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dembo|first1=Richard|last2=Dertke|first2=Max|last3=La Voie|first3=Lawrence|last4=Borders|first4=Scott|last5=Washburn|first5=Mark|last6=Schmeidler|first6=James|title=Physical abuse, sexual victimization and illicit drug use: A structural analysis among high risk adolescents|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=March 1987|volume=10|issue=1|pages=13–34|doi=10.1016/S0140-1971(87)80030-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Specific types of victimization have been strongly linked to particular symptoms or outcomes. These symptoms are not exclusively associated with these forms of victimization but have been studied in association with them, possibly because of their relevance to the specific victimization experiences.

===Sexual===
Some individuals who have experienced victimization may have difficulty establishing and maintaining [[intimate relationships]].&lt;ref name="PTSD"/&gt; This is not a subset of symptoms that is exclusive to sexual victimization, but the link between sexual victimization and intimacy problems has been particularly well-established in research. These difficulties may include sexual dysfunction, anxiety about sexual relationships, and dating aggression.&lt;ref name="number3"/&gt; Those who experience sexual victimization may have these difficulties long-term, as in the case of victimized children who continue to have difficulty with intimacy during adolescence and adulthood.&lt;ref name="number3"/&gt; Some research suggests that the severity of these intimacy problems is related directly to the severity of victimization, while other research suggests that self-blame and shame about sexual victimization mediates (causes) the relationship between victimization and outcomes.&lt;ref name="number3"/&gt;

===Childhood bullying===
One symptom that has been associated particularly with school-based peer victimization is poor academic functioning.&lt;ref name="number9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Junsheng|last2=Bullock|first2=Amanda|last3=Coplan|first3=Robert J.|title=Predictive relations between peer victimization and academic achievement in Chinese children.|journal=School Psychology Quarterly|date=2014|volume=29|issue=1|pages=89–98|doi=10.1037/spq0000044}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symptom is not exclusive to peer victimization, but is contextually relevant due to the setting in which such victimization takes place. Studies have shown poor academic functioning to be a result of peer victimization in elementary, middle, and high school in multiple countries.&lt;ref name="number9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=David|last2=Gorman|first2=Andrea Hopmeyer|last3=Nakamoto|first3=Jonathan|last4=Toblin|first4=Robin L.|title=Victimization in the Peer Group and Children's Academic Functioning.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=2005|volume=97|issue=3|pages=425–435|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.97.3.425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though academic functioning has commonly been studied in relation to childhood bullying that takes place in schools, it is likely associated with other forms of victimization as well, as both depression and anxiety affect attention and focus.&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt;

===Childhood physical abuse===
Researchers have drawn connections between childhood physical abuse and tendencies toward violent or aggressive behaviors both during childhood and later in life.&lt;ref name="Malinosky"/&gt; This aligns logically with increases in aggression and reactivity described above (see psychological symptoms section). The increased risk for engaging in aggressive behavior may be an indirect symptom, mediated by changes in the way that individuals process social information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dodge|first1=K.|last2=Bates|first2=J.|last3=Pettit|first3=G.|title=Mechanisms in the cycle of violence|journal=Science|date=21 December 1990|volume=250|issue=4988|pages=1678–1683|doi=10.1126/science.2270481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased risk does not mean that everyone who was physically victimized during childhood will continue the cycle of violence with their own children or engage in aggressive behaviors to a point that it is highly detrimental or requires legal action; estimated numbers of individuals who do continue this pattern vary based on the type of aggressive behavior being studied. For example, 16-21% of abused and/or neglected children in one particular study were arrested for violent offenses by around the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maxfield|first1=Michael G.|title=The Cycle of Violence|journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine|date=1 April 1996|volume=150|issue=4|pages=390|doi=10.1001/archpedi.1996.02170290056009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moderating factors==
In psychology, a [[Moderation (statistics)|moderator]] is a factor that changes the outcome of a particular situation. With regards to victimization, these can take the form of environmental or contextual characteristics, other people’s responses after victimization has occurred, or a victimized person’s internal responses to or views on what they have experienced.

===Attributions===

[[Attribution (psychology)|Attribution]]s about a situation or person refer to where an individual places the blame for an event.  An individual may have a different response to being victimized and exhibit different symptoms if they interpret the victimization as being their own fault, the fault of the perpetrator of the victimization, or the fault of some other external factor.&lt;ref name="number6"/&gt; Attributions also vary by how stable or controllable someone believes a situation to be. Characterological self-blame for victimization (believing that something is one's own fault, that it is a stable characteristic about themselves, and that it is unchangeable or out of their control) has been shown to make victims feel particularly helpless and to have a negative effect on psychological outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=Sandra|last2=Bellmore|first2=Amy|last3=Nishina|first3=Adrienne|last4=Juvonen|first4=Jaana|title="It Must Be Me": Ethnic Diversity and Attributions for Peer Victimization in Middle School|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=7 January 2009|volume=38|issue=4|pages=487–499|doi=10.1007/s10964-008-9386-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While self-blaming attributions have potentially harmful moderating effects on the symptoms of victimization for those who are already prone to self-blame, it is worth noting that self-blame may itself be a result of victimization for some individuals as noted above (see [[#Posttraumatic_stress_disorder|section on PTSD]]).&lt;ref name="PTSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D’Andrea|first1=Wendy|last2=Ford|first2=Julian|last3=Stolbach|first3=Bradley|last4=Spinazzola|first4=Joseph|last5=van der Kolk|first5=Bessel A.|author-link5= Bessel van der Kolk|title=Understanding interpersonal trauma in children: Why we need a developmentally appropriate trauma diagnosis.|journal=American Journal of Orthopsychiatry|date=2012|volume=82|issue=2|pages=187–200|doi=10.1111/j.1939-0025.2012.01154.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coping and help-seeking===

Victimized individuals who participate in active forms of [[coping (psychology)|coping]] experience fewer or less severe psychological symptoms after victimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Julian D.|title=Ethnoracial and educational differences in victimization history, trauma-related symptoms, and coping style.|journal=Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy|date=2012|volume=4|issue=2|pages=177–185|doi=10.1037/a0023670}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One form of active coping is seeking help from others. Help-seeking can be informal (e.g. seeking help from friends or family) or formal (e.g. police reporting of victimization).&lt;ref name="help"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuevas|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Bell|first2=Kristin A.|last3=Sabina|first3=Chiara|title=Victimization, psychological distress, and help-seeking: Disentangling the relationship for Latina victims.|journal=Psychology of Violence|date=2014|volume=4|issue=2|pages=196–209|doi=10.1037/a0035819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attributions about victimization may play a role in whether an individual seeks help or from whom they seek it. For example, a recent study showed that children who are being victimized by peers are less likely to seek support from friends or teachers if they attribute victimization to a group factor such as race, and more likely to seek support if they attribute victimization to more individualized personal characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visconti|first1=Kari Jeanne|last2=Sechler|first2=Casey M.|last3=Kochenderfer-Ladd|first3=Becky|title=Coping with peer victimization: The role of children’s attributions.|journal=School Psychology Quarterly|date=2013|volume=28|issue=2|pages=122–140|doi=10.1037/spq0000014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, adult victims who blame themselves and are ashamed of being victimized may wish to hide the experience from others, and thus be less willing to seek help.&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt; Gender may affect willingness seek help as well; men who have been victimized may be less willing to disclose this information and ask for help due to differing societal expectations for men in addition to the shame and stigmatization experienced by both men and women in response to victimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorsoli|first1=Lynn|last2=Kia-Keating|first2=Maryam|last3=Grossman|first3=Frances K.|title="I keep that hush-hush": Male survivors of sexual abuse and the challenges of disclosure.|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=2008|volume=55|issue=3|pages=333–345|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.55.3.333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased social support that sometimes results from seeking help may alleviate some of the symptoms of victimization and decrease the risk of continued or future victimization.&lt;ref name="SOV"/&gt; However, seeking help may also make the outcomes and symptoms worse, depending on the context and responses to help-seeking behavior. Help-seeking may be received more positively from some individuals than others; for example, elementary school aged girls who seek social support after victimization may benefit from it socially, while victimized boys of the same age may experience worse social problems as a result of the same support-seeking behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kochenderfer-Ladd|first1=Becky|last2=Skinner|first2=Karey|title=Children's coping strategies: Moderators of the effects of peer victimization?|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2002|volume=38|issue=2|pages=267–278|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.38.2.267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking help may also increase the severity of victimization symptoms if an individual experiences [[victimisation|secondary victimization]] in the form of [[victim-blaming]], being forced to mentally relive a victimization experience, or other negative responses from individuals or institutions from whom they seek help.&lt;ref name="PTSD"/&gt; Secondary victimization has been documented in victims of rape when they seek medical or psychological assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Rebecca|last2=Raja|first2=Sheela|title=THE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SECONDARY VICTIMIZATION OF FEMALE VETERANS: HELP-SEEKING EXPERIENCES WITH MILITARY AND CIVILIAN SOCIAL SYSTEMS|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|date=March 2005|volume=29|issue=1|pages=97–106|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2005.00171.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been documented in individuals whose victimization results in criminal trials, particularly if the outcomes of those trials were not in the victims' favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orth|first1=Uli|title=Secondary Victimization of Crime Victims by Criminal Proceedings|journal=Social Justice Research|date=2002|volume=15|issue=4|pages=313–325|doi=10.1023/A:1021210323461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tea Tax Tempest.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Guttenberg]]'s 1778 ''Tea-Tax Tempest'', with exploding teapot'']]
'''Tempest in a teapot''' ([[American English]]), or '''storm in a teacup''' ([[British English]]), is an [[idiom]] meaning a small event that has been exaggerated out of proportion. There are also lesser known or earlier variants, such as ''tempest in a teacup'', ''storm in a cream bowl'', ''tempest in a glass of water'', ''storm in a wash-hand basin'',&lt;ref&gt;Christine Ammer, ''The American Heritage dictionary of idioms'', p. 647, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1997 {{ISBN|0-395-72774-X}}, 9780395727744&lt;/ref&gt; and ''storm in a glass of water''.

== Etymology ==

[[Cicero]], in the first century BC, in his ''[[De Legibus]]'', used a similar phrase in Latin, possibly the precursor to the modern expressions, "''Excitabat enim fluctus in simpulo ut dicitur Gratidius''", translated: "For Gratidius raised a tempest in a ladle, as the saying is".&lt;ref name=Reddall&gt;{{cite book|last=Reddall|first=Henry Frederic|title=Fact, fancy, and fable: a new handbook for ready reference on subjects commonly omitted from cyclopaedias|year=1892|publisher=A.C McClurg|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in the early 3rd century AD, [[Athenaeus]], in the ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', has Dorion ridiculing the description of a tempest in the ''Nautilus'' of Timotheus by saying that he had seen a more formidable storm in a boiling saucepan.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=John|title=Familiar quotations: a collection of passages, phrases, and proverbs traced to their sources in ancient and modern literature|year=1891|publisher=Little, Brown, and company|page=767}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase also appeared in its French form "une tempête dans un verre d'eau" (a tempest in a glass of water), to refer to the popular uprising in the Republic of Geneva near the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Lippincott&gt;{{cite journal|title=Whence the phrase "a tempest in a teapot"?|journal=Lippincott's monthly magazine: a popular journal of general literature|date=March 1889|volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

One of the earliest occurrences in print of the modern version is in 1815, where Britain's [[Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow|Lord Chancellor Thurlow]], sometime during his tenure of 1783–1792, is quoted as referring to a popular uprising on the [[Isle of Man]] as a "tempest in a teapot".&lt;ref name=Kett&gt;{{cite book|last=Kett|first=Henry|title=The flowers of wit, or, A choice collection of bon mots, both antient and modern, with biographical and critical remarks, Volume 2|year=1814|publisher=Lackington, Allen, and co|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]], Prime Minister of Great Britain, is credited for popularizing this phrase as characterizing the outbreak of American colonists against the [[tea tax|tax on tea]].&lt;ref name=Hartford&gt;{{cite journal|title=''A Tempest in a Teapot''|journal=Hartford Herald|date=July 10, 1907|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment was then satirized in Carl Guttenberg's 1778 engraving of the ''Tea-Tax Tempest'' (shown above right), where Father Time flashes a [[magic lantern]] picture of an exploding teapot to America on the left and Britannia on the right, with British and American forces advancing towards the teapot.  Just a little later, in 1825, in the Scottish journal ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'', a critical review of poets Hogg and Campbell also included the phrase "tempest in a teapot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackwood|first=William|title=Scotch Poets, Hogg and Campbell|journal=Blackwood's Edinburgh magazine|year=1825|volume=17|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nItIAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;ots=uIQpnu05CX&amp;dq=Blackwood's%20Edinburgh%20Magazine%20%22tempest%20in%20a%20teapot%22&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
 
The first recorded instance of the British English version, "storm in teacup", occurs in Catherine Sinclair's ''Modern Accomplishments'' in 1838.&lt;ref name="Phrase Finder"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tempest in a teapot|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/tempest-in-a-teapot.html|work=The Phrase Finder|accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinclair|first=Catherine|title=Modern accomplishments ; or, The march of intellect|year=1836|publisher=Waugh and Innes|page=204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gwnAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22storm%20in%20a%20teacup%22&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several instances though of earlier British use of the similar phrase "storm in a wash-hand basin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Storm in a wash-hand basin (pre-1938)|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22storm+in+a+wash-hand+basin%22&amp;tbs=,cdr:1,cd_max:Dec%2031_2%201838&amp;num=10|work=Google Books search|accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''temporal expression''' in a text is a sequence of tokens (words, numbers and characters) that denote time, that is express a point in time, a duration or a frequency. 
Examples:
:A point in time: 
&lt;pre&gt;He was born on &lt;TIMEX&gt;6 May, 1980&lt;/TIMEX&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;
:A duration:
&lt;pre&gt;The show lasted &lt;TIMEX&gt;7 minutes&lt;/TIMEX&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;
:A frequency:
&lt;pre&gt;The pump circulates the water &lt;TIMEX&gt;every 2 hours&lt;/TIMEX&gt;.&lt;/pre&gt;

Initially, temporal expressions were considered a type of named entities and their identification was part of the [[named entity recognition]] task. Since the Automatic Content Extraction program in 2004 there has been a separate task identified and called Temporal Expression Recognition and Normalisation (TERN). Timex evaluation is now evaluated in two major temporal annotation challenges: [[TempEval]] and [[i2b2]], both of which prefer the [[TimeML]]-level TIMEX3 standard.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://timeml.org/site/publications/timeMLdocs/timeml_1.2.1.html#timex3 TIMEX3 at timeml.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Similarly to NER systems, temporal expression taggers have been created either using linguistic [[formal grammar|grammar]]-based techniques or [[statistical model]]s. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtained better results, but at the cost of months of work by experienced linguists. There are many such systems available now,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strötgen|first=Jannik|author2=Michael Gertz |title=HeidelTime: High quality rule-based extraction and normalization of temporal expressions|journal=Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation|year=2010|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Llorens|first=Hector|author2=Leon Derczynski |author3=Robert Gaizauskas |author4=Estela Saquete |title=TIMEN: An Open Temporal Expression Normalisation Resource|journal=LREC|year=2012|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Filannino|first=Michele|author2=Gavin Brown |author3=Goran Nenadic |title=ManTIME: Temporal identification and normalization in the TempEval-3 challenge|journal=Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation|year=2013|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt; so creating a temporal expression recognizer from scratch is generally an undesirable duplication of effort. Instead, current approaches focus on novel subclasses of timex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brucato|first=Matteo|author2=Leon Derczynski |author3=Hector Llorens |author4=Kalina Bontcheva |author5=Christian S. Jensen |title=Recognising and Interpreting Named Temporal Expressions|journal=Proceedings of the International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing|year=2013|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical systems typically require a large amount of manually [[annotation|annotated]] training data and are usually applied to the recognition task only (although there is work done using machine learning algorithms to resolve certain ambiguities in the interpretation step).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Harvnb|Ahn|van Rantwijk|de Rijke|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Angeli|first=Gabor|author2=Christoper Manning |author3=Daniel Jurafsky |title=Parsing time: Learning to interpret time expressions|journal=Proceedings of NAACL|year=2012|page=446|publisher=ACL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Superclass List''''' is a creation of [[David Rothkopf]] which his book ''[[Superclass (book)|Superclass: The Global Power Elite and The World They Are Making]]'' (publ. March 2008) is based upon. There are four key elements of success that unite the members of the Superclass, and gives them unparalleled power over world affairs. These elements are: ''geography'', ''pedigree'', ''networking'' and ''luck''.&lt;ref name=global&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolitician.com/24830-business|title=The New 'Superclass' – Hype -vs- Reality|last=Latif|first=Iqbal|date=2008-01-06|work=Global Politician|accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC right}}

==The verified list==
In the book Rothkopf writes that his list from 2008 contains 6,000 individuals. The grouping is, however, only defined roughly and as a statistical reality. Rothkopf also writes that list  (one in a million, [[world population|globally]]), is always in flux. (Note, world population is now 6.9 - 7 billion. so, if published today, the list may contain 7,000 names)

Rothkopf states that his list is not to be shown in public as there will be so much discussion about who does or does not qualify to be on the list. In interviews he mentions individuals that are on the list. This list contain names that he argues he has verified.

The '''xartcollection''' was created in 1968 in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] by [[Sandro Bocola]] and three partners: Heinz Bütler, Rolf Fehlbaum and Erwin Meierhofer.

Xartcollection’s concept was to industrially produce three-dimensional “Multiples” in limited and signed editions. The company’s philosophy was to make [[contemporary Art]] available to a large public and its “Multiples” where sold worldwide in art galleries, design- and furniture stores namely at “Wohnbedarf”[http://www.wohnbedarf.ch/] in Switzerland.

Internationally renowned artists such as [[Max Bill]], [[Getulio Alviani]], [[Richard Hamilton (artist)]], [[Allen Jones (sculptor)]], [[Joe Tilson (artist)|Joe Tilson]], [[Peter Phillips (artist)]] and others participated in this project. Most of xartcollection's "Multiples" were produced by the firm of Reif, Relo-Kunststoffe in [[Lörrach]], [[Germany]]. 
In 1971 xartcollection also created "Xart Walls"[http://www.sandrobocola.com/eng/html/bio_layer.htm] which industrially produced [[wallpapers]] designed by known artists such as [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]]. The "Xart Walls" where manufactured by the firm "Marburg Wallcoverings" in [[Kirchhain]], Germany.

Despite its international reputation the company went bankrupt and was dissolved in 1973.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1825">'''The Tolerance Act''' ({{lang-sv|Toleransediktet}}) was a Swedish law, enacted by [[Gustav III of Sweden]] 24 January 1781. It guaranteed freedom of religion and full citizen rights for all Christian immigrants and residents in Sweden.   

Since the [[Uppsala Synod]] of 1593, Lutheranism had officially been the only religion allowed in Sweden, though the foreign embassies were given dispensation. The Tolerance Act was introduced in line with the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. There were also an economical aspect, as it would make it easier for foreigners to work in Sweden. By the Act, all Christian immigrants were granted full freedom of religion and guaranteed their right to bring up their children in their faith as well. This act was followed in 1782 by the ''[[Judereglementet]]'' (The Jew's Law), which guaranteed the freedom of religion for Jewish immigrants. This Act was a step toward full freedom of religion in Sweden. However, they only applied to immigrants and foreigners, while the Lutheran Swedish citizens were still prohibited their freedom of religion through the ''[[konventikelplakatet]]''. 

The Tolerance Act was replaced by the [[Dissenter Acts (Sweden)]] from the 1850s, which guaranteed freedom of religion to all Swedish citizens. 

The final act was the law of 1951, which allowed for complete freedom of conscience by allowing citizens from leaving their religion without replacing it with another one, thereby formally also allowing atheism.

An '''upset''' occurs in a [[competition]], frequently in [[Election|electoral]] [[politics]] or [[sports]], when the party popularly expected to win (the favorite), either loses to or draws/ties a game with an [[Underdog (term)|underdog]] whom the majority expects to lose, defying the [[conventional wisdom]].

The meaning of the word has sometimes been erroneously attributed to the surprising defeat of the horse [[Man o' War]] by the horse [[Upset (horse)|Upset]] (the loss was the only one in Man o' War's career); the term pre-dates that 1919 race by at least several decades. In its sports coverage immediately following Upset's victory, ''[[the Washington Post]]'' wrote, "One might make all sorts of puns about it being an upset."

==Origin==
In 2002, George Thompson, a lexicographic researcher, used the full-text online search capabilities of ''[[the New York Times]]'' databases to trace the usage of the verb ''to upset'' &lt;!-- adjective? --&gt; and the noun ''upset''. The latter was seen in usage as early as 1877.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/upset "Upset"] at Wordorigins.org.  Retrieved April 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson's research debunked one popular theory of the term's origin, namely that it was first used after the Thoroughbred racehorse Upset became the only horse to defeat [[Man o' War]] in 1919.

The meaning of the word "upset" has long included "an overthrowing or overturn of ideas, plans, etc." (see [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] definition 6b), from which the sports definition almost surely derived. "Upset" also once referred to "a curved part of a bridle-bit, fitting over the tongue of the horse", (now the port of a [[curb bit]]) and though the modern sports meaning of "upset" was first used far more for horse races than for any other competition, there is no evidence of a connection. The name of the horse "Upset" came from the "trouble" or "distress" meaning of word (as shown by the parallelism of the name of Upset's stablemate, [[Regret (horse)|Regret]]).

==Examples of usage==
  
The [[marketer]] Matt Bailey described it as "a desire to see something done, but not enough desire to make it happen".&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Matt Bailey, "Viral marketing", excerpt "Analytics 1.0 - A Case of Velleity," found at [http://www.sitelogicmarketing.com/blog/07-analytics-velleity Site Logic marketing website].  Accessed April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern writing===

Matt Bailey expressed an attempt "to bring it back, as it has more relevance now than ever."&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;  He writes that:
{{quote|Velleity is what keeps companies locked in this mindset of reporting useless numbers. Desiring, even expecting to someday have an epiphany of change, but not willing to change the mindset or the culture of locked-in reporting to achieve it. Nor are they willing to ask the hard questions in order to uncover what must be done.|Matt Bailey, marketing writer&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;}}

===In philosophy===

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] describes the velleity of an [[artist]] as a "desire to ''be'' 'what he is able to represent, conceive, and express'...."&lt;ref&gt;
Aaron Ridley, in "Nietzsche, philosophy and the arts," ed. by Salim Kemal, Ivan Gaskell, Daniel W. Conway, at pp. 128-131 (Cambridge University Press, 2002) {{ISBN|0-521-52272-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-52272-4}} (emphasis provided), found at [https://books.google.com/books?id=8GzFg3pH4SIC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=Velleity+%2B+philosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MljPsygceA&amp;sig=SWt2zXpiLVhU9oBymK3jfNIAKQs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TrH4SfCODNOGmQeOj-GYDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPA134,M1 Google Book search]. Accessed April 29, 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Nietzsche championed the [[will to power]], which can be encapsulated{{by whom?|date=November 2012}} as starting with velleity, in his [[free-will theorem]].

Keith David Wyma refers frequently to the "concept of velleity", citing [[Thomas Aquinas]] as a pioneer of introducing the idea into philosophy.&lt;ref name=Wyma&gt;
Keith David Wyma, ''Crucible of reason'', pp. 197, 221, 223, 225, 227 (Rowman and Littlefield 2004).  {{ISBN|978-0-7425-3538-1}}.

Also found at [http://www.thelogician.net/4b_volition/4b_chapter_09.htm The Logician website].  All accessed June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example he cites is that "an ordinarily desirable object can only properly be called 'interesting' or 'tempting' to that [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] at that time, if he manifests some velleity...."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;
He distinguishes between the two types of velleity - "''to do'' something and one ''not to do'' something...."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  Furthermore, he asserts, "The concept of velleity is also important because it enables us to understand the co-existence of conflicting values."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  A person could thus have "double velleity" or "a mix of velleity for something and a volition for its opposite: the latter dominates, of course, but that does not erase the fact of velleity."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;

Kathy Kolbe also lists velleity as a "key concept of [[conation]]."&lt;ref name=Kolbe&gt;See [http://www.kolbe.com/knol/keyConceptsOfConation.htm Kathy Kolbe's website page on Conation].  Accessed June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19994">'''Vietnamese units of measurement''' ({{lang-vi|hệ đo lường Việt Nam}}) are the largely decimal [[units of measurement]] traditionally used in [[Vietnam]] until [[metrication]]&lt;!-- in 1963, per [[Metrication]] --&gt;. The base unit of length is the ''thước'' ([[Chu Nom|chữ Nôm]]: 𡱩; lit. "ruler") or ''xích'' ({{zh|c=尺|p=[[Chi (unit)|chǐ]]}}). Some of the traditional unit names have been repurposed for [[Metric system|metric]] units, such as ''thước'' for the [[metre]], while other traditional names remain in translations of [[imperial units]], such as ''dặm Anh'' for the English [[mile]].

==History==
Originally, many ''thước'' of varying lengths were in use in Vietnam, each used for different purposes. According to [[Hoàng Phê]] (1988),&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite dictionary|ref=harv|editor=Hoàng Phê|title=Từ điển tiếng Việt|publisher=Sociology Publishing House|year=1988|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional system of units had at least two ''thước'' of different lengths before 1890,&lt;ref name="Khoi"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lê Thành Khôi|title=Tìm hiểu một số đơn vị đo lường ngày trước|trans-title=Understanding some of the units of measurements from the past|work=Kỷ yếu Hội thảo phục hồi điện Cần Chánh|publisher=Hue Monuments Conservation Center and [[Waseda University]]|location=[[Huế]] and [[Tokyo]]|year=2000|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''thước ta'' (lit. "our ruler") or ''thước mộc'' ("wooden ruler"), equal to {{convert|0.425|m}}, and the ''thước đo vải'' ("ruler for measuring cloth"), equal to {{convert|0.645|m}}. According to historian [[Nguyễn Đình Đầu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nguyễn Đình Đầu|title=Nghiên cứu địa bạ triều Nguyễn – Thừa Thiên|publisher=Ho Chi Minh City Publishing House|year=1997|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nguyễn Đình Đầu|title=Nghiên cứu địa bạ triều Nguyễn – Biên Hòa|publisher=Ho Chi Minh City Publishing House|year=1994|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''trường xích'' and ''điền xích'' were both equal to {{convert|0.4664|m}}, while according to Phan Thanh Hải,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hue.vnn.vn/vedephue/ditichthangcanh/2009/03/317553/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130114070357/http://www.hue.vnn.vn/vedephue/ditichthangcanh/2009/03/317553/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-14|title=Hệ thống thước đo thời Nguyễn|trans-title=Systems of length measurement during the Nguyễn dynasty|publisher=NetCoDo|date=2009-06-03|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were three main ''thước'': the ''thước đo vải'', from {{convert|0.6|to|0.65|m}}; the ''thước đo đất'' ("ruler for measuring land"), at {{convert|0.47|m}}; and the ''thước mộc'', from {{convert|0.28|to|0.5|m}}.

With [[French Indochina|French colonization]], [[Cochinchina]] converted to the [[metric system]], the French standard, while [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin]] continued to use a ''thước đo đất'' or ''điền xích'' equal to {{convert|0.47|m}}. On June 2, 1897, [[List of Governors-General of French Indochina|Indochinese Governor-General]] [[Paul Doumer]] decreed that all the variations of ''thước'' (such as ''thước ta'', ''thước mộc'', and ''điền xích'') would be unified at one ''thước ta'' to {{convert|0.40|m}}, effective January 1, 1898, in Tonkin. Annam retained the old standard for measuring land, so distance and area (such as ''sào'') in Annam were 4.7/4 and (4.7/4)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; times the equivalent units in Tonkin, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dương Kinh Quốc|title=Việt Nam: những sự kiện lịch sử|trans-title=Vietnam: historic events|publisher=Education Publishing House|location=[[Hanoi]]|page=236|year=1999|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Length==
The following table lists common units of length in Vietnam in the early 20th century, according to a [[United Nations Statistical Commission]] handbook:&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical Office of the United Nations|chapter=World Weights and Measures|title=Handbook for Statisticians|series=Statistical Papers|volume=M|issue=21|edition=1|id=ST/STAT/SER.M/21/rev.1|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="length"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vietnam, pre-metric units of length|work=Sizes|publisher=Sizes, Inc|date=2005-12-28|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/charts/UTBLVietnam_len.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notes:
*The ''thước'' is also called ''thước ta'' to distinguish it from the metre (''thước tây'', lit. "Western ruler"). Other than for measuring length, the ''thước'' is also used for measuring land area (see [[#Area|below]]).
*According to the UN handbook,&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; some areas unofficially use 1 ''trượng'' = {{convert|4.7|m}}. According to Hoàng Phê (1988),{{sfn|Hoàng Phê|1988|p=1093}} the ''trượng'' has two definitions: 10 Chinese ''[[Chi (unit)|chi]]'' (about 3.33&amp;nbsp;m) or 4 ''thước mộc'' (about 1.70&amp;nbsp;m).
*The ''tấc'' is also given as ''túc''.&lt;ref name="Sizes, Inc"&gt;{{cite web|title=túc|work=Sizes|publisher=Sizes, Inc|date=2001-10-17|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/tu_c.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UN handbook,&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; some areas unofficially use 1 ''tấc'' = {{convert|4.7|cm}}.

==Area==
The following table lists common units of area in Vietnam in the early 20th century, according to the UN handbook:&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;

|-
| ''khấu'' ||  || 0.016 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ||  ||  ||
|}

Notes:
*Annamite units of area were (4.7/4)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; times those of other areas, due to units of length (''trượng'', ''tấc'', etc.) being 4.7/4 times those of other areas, as explained [[#History|above]].
*According to the UN handbook,&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; the ''phân'' is also written ''phấn''.
*The ''sào'' is also given as ''cao''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=cao|work=Sizes|publisher=Sizes, Inc|date=2005-12-28|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/cao.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tonkin and Annam had different definitions of the ''sào''.

Miscellaneous units:

;''công'' or ''công đất''
:The ''công'', used for surveying forested areas, typically in southwestern Vietnam, was equivalent to {{convert|1000|m2}}.
;''dặm vuông''
:The ''dặm vuông'' measures 1 ''dặm'' × 1 ''dặm''.

*1 ''phương'' or ''vuông'' or commonly ''giạ'' = {{convert|38.5|L}}, though it is sometimes given as 1 ''phương'' = ½ ''hộc'' or about 30&amp;nbsp;L
*During French administration, 1 ''giạ'' was defined as {{convert|40|L}} for husked rice but only {{convert|20|L}} for some other goods.&lt;ref name="Savani"&gt;{{cite book|last=Savani|first=A.

Notes:
*Unhusked rice was measured in ''hộc'' while husked rice was measured in ''vuông'' because a ''hộc'' of unhusked rice becomes 1 ''vuông'' after husking.
*1 ''hộc'' of unhusked rice weighs 1 ''tạ''.

Miscellaneous units:

Notes:

*The ''cân'' (lit. "scale") is also called ''cân ta'' ("our scale") to distinguish it from the [[kilogram]] (''cân tây'', "Western scale").
*The ''nén'' is also given in one source as {{convert|375|g}},&lt;ref name="FVDP" /&gt; but this value conflicts with the ''lạng'' from the same source at {{convert|37.8|g}}. The 375-gram value is consistent with the system of units for [[#Precious metals|measuring precious metals]].
*The ''đồng'' is also called ''đồng cân'', to distinguish it from [[#Currency|monetary]] uses.&lt;ref name="FVDP" /&gt;
*The French colonial administration defined some additional units for use in trade: ''nén'' = 2 ''thoi'' = 10 ''đính'' = 10 ''lượng''&lt;ref name="MCFA" /&gt;

&lt;p id="Precious_metals"&gt;Units for measuring precious metals:
*The ''lạng'', also called ''cây'' or ''lượng'', is equal to 10 ''chỉ''. 1 cây = {{convert|37.50|g}}
*1 ''chỉ'' = {{convert|3.75|g}}

Miscellaneous units:
;''binh''
*The ''binh'' was equivalent to {{convert|69|lb}} in Annam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=binh|work=Sizes|publisher=Sizes, Inc|date=2004-01-23|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/binh.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time==
;''canh'' (更)
:The ''canh'' or ''trống canh'' is equal to {{convert|2|h|s}}.
;''giờ''
:The ''giờ'', ''giờ đồng hồ'', or ''tiếng đồng hồ'' is equal to {{convert|1|h|s}}.

==Currency==
Traditionally, the basic units of Vietnamese currency were ''quan'' (貫, ''quán''), ''[[tiền]]'', and ''[[Vietnamese đồng|đồng]]''. One ''quan'' was 10 ''tiền'', and one ''tiền'' was between 50 and 100 ''đồng'', depending on the time period.

*From the reign of Emperor [[Trần Thái Tông]] onward, 1 ''tiền'' was 69 ''đồng'' in ordinary commercial transactions but 1 ''tiền'' was 70 ''đồng'' for official transactions.
*From the reign of Emperor [[Lê Lợi]], 1 ''tiền'' was decreed to be 50 ''đồng''.
*During the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties of Vietnam]] period, beginning in 1528, coins were reduced from {{convert|24|mm}} to {{convert|23|mm}} in diameter and diluted with zinc and iron. The smaller coinage was called ''tiền gián'' or ''sử tiền'', in contrast to the larger ''tiền quý'' (literally, "valuable cash") or ''cổ tiền''. One ''quan tiền quý'' was equivalent to 600 ''đồng'', while 1 ''quan tiền gián'' was only 360 ''đồng''.&lt;ref name="Ta Chi Dai Truong"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Tiền bạc, văn chương và lịch sử|title=Sử Việt, đọc vài quyển|author=Tạ Chí Đại Trường|authorlink=Tạ Chí Đại Trường|publisher=Văn Mới Publishing House|year=2004|chapterurl=http://www.vcomtech.net/vn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=954:s-vit-c-vai-quyn-4&amp;catid=38:lichsuvietnam&amp;Itemid=527|language=Vietnamese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the [[Lê Dynasty|Later Lê Dynasty]], 1 ''tiền'' was 60 ''đồng''; therefore, 600 ''đồng'' was 1 ''quan''.
*During the [[Yuan Dynasty]], Vietnamese traders at the border with China used the rate 1 ''tiền'' to 67 ''đồng''.
*Zinc coins began to appear in [[Dai Viet]] during the 18th century. One copper (''đồng'') coin was worth 3 zinc (''kẽm'') coins.
*Beginning with the reign of Emperor [[Gia Long]], both copper and zinc coins were in use. Originally the two coins had equal value, but eventually a copper coin rose to double the worth of a zinc coin, then triple, then sixfold, until the reign of Emperor [[Thành Thái]], it was worth ten times a zinc coin.

Under French colonial rule, Vietnam used the units ''hào'', ''xu'', ''chinh'', and ''cắc''. After independence, Vietnam used ''đồng'', ''hào'', and ''xu'', with 1 ''đồng'' equaling 10 ''hào'' or 100 ''xu''. After the Vietnam War, chronic inflation caused both subdivisions to fall out of use, leaving ''đồng'' as the only unit of currency. However, [[Overseas Vietnamese]] communities continue to use ''hào'' and ''xu'' to refer to the tenth and hundredth denominations, respectively, of a foreign currency, such as ''xu'' for the [[Penny (United States coin)|American cent]].

The '''World Day of Peace''' is a feast day of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] dedicated to [[world peace|universal peace]], held on 1 January, the [[Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] established it in 1967, being inspired by the encyclical ''[[Pacem in Terris]]'' of [[Pope John XXIII]] and with reference to his own encyclical ''[[Populorum Progressio]]''. The day was first observed on 1 January 1968.

World Day of Peace often has been an occasion on which the Popes made [[Magisterium|magisterial]] declarations of [[Catholic social teaching|social doctrine]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] and [[Pope John Paul II]] made important declarations on the Day in each year of their pontificates regarding the [[United Nations]], [[human rights]], [[women's rights]], [[labor union|labor unions]], [[economic development]], [[right to life|the right to life]], international [[diplomacy]], peace in the [[Holy Land]] ([[Israel]]), [[globalization]], and [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60000705.html?dids=60000705:60000705&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Dec+19%2C+1990&amp;author=WILLIAM+D.+MONTALBANO&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Pope+Assails+Totalitarianism%2C+Intolerance+Religion%3A+John+Paul%2C+in+World+Day+of+Peace+message%2C+also+calls+fundamentalism+a+threat+to+peace.&amp;pqatl=google ''Pope Assails Totalitarianism, Intolerance of Religion: John Paul, in World Day of Peace Message, Also Calls Fundamentalism a Threat to Peace.''] ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], "Peace Sunday" is traditionally observed on the Second Sunday of Ordinary Time, which is the Sunday occurring between 14 and 20 January, inclusive. The British branch of the [[Pax Christi]] movement prepares suggested material for it annually.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Bishop Malcolm McMahon to Catholic Parishes in England and Wales for Peace Sunday 2012, partially quoted in [http://www.paxchristi.org.uk/press1.php].&lt;/ref&gt;
