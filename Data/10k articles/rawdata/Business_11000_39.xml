      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1354">'''722 Redemption''' is a process within the [[Bankruptcy in the United States|U.S. bankruptcy code]] under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|section 11 U.S.C. 722]] that allows a debtor to redeem collateral based on the market value of the collateral. The bankruptcy code allows a debtor to pay the retail value of the collateral in a lump sum payment to the creditor in exchange for the lien on the collateral being released. 

In order for 722 redemption to apply the item in question must be personal property intended primarily for personal, family or household use. The [[interest]] in the property must be exempted under the bankruptcy code or has to be abandoned by the bankruptcy estate in order for 722 redemption to be used. Once a bankruptcy case is filed a debtor must file a motion in court and obtain a court order to redeem the property. This process is most commonly used to redeem vehicles that are worth less than the outstanding loan on the vehicle. The process allows a debtor to pay the current market value of the vehicle versus the outstanding [[loan]] on the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/722|title=11 U.S. Code § 722 - Redemption|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tenured''' appointment is an indefinite academic appointment that can be terminated only for [[Causation (law)|cause]] or under extraordinary circumstances, such as financial exigency or program discontinuation. Tenure is a means of defending the principle of [[academic freedom]], which holds that it is beneficial for society in the long run if scholars are free to hold and examine a variety of views.

The modern conception of tenure in US higher education originated with the [[American Association of University Professors]]' (AAUP) 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure|title=1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure – AAUP|website=Aaup.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jointly formulated and endorsed by the AAUP and the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] (AAC&amp;U), the 1940 Statement is endorsed by over 250 scholarly and higher education organizations and is widely adopted into faculty handbooks and collective bargaining agreements at institutions of higher education throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/issues/tenure|title=What is academic tenure?|website=Aaup.org|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement holds that, "The common good depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition" and stresses that academic freedom is essential in teaching and research in this regard.

== By Country ==
=== North America ===
{{See also|Academic tenure in North America}}
Under the tenure systems adopted by many [[university|universities]] and [[college]]s in the United States and Canada, some faculty positions have tenure and some do not. Typical systems (such as the widely adopted "1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure" of the [[American Association of University Professors]]&lt;ref&gt;http://aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure; this statement has been adopted by more than 200 scholarly and academic groups (http://aaup.org/endorsers-1940-statement). The American Association of University Professors also publishes [http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/policydocs/contents/RIR.htm "Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure"].&lt;/ref&gt;) allow only a limited period to establish a record of published research, ability to attract grant funding, [[academic visibility]], teaching excellence, and administrative or community service. They limit the number of years that any employee can remain employed as a non-tenured instructor or professor, compelling the institution to grant tenure to or terminate an individual, with significant advance notice, at the end of a specified time period. Some institutions require promotion to Associate Professor as a condition of tenure. An institution may also offer other academic positions that are not time-limited, with titles such as Lecturer, Adjunct Professor, or Research Professor, but these positions do not carry the possibility of tenure and are said to not be "tenure track." Typically, they have higher teaching loads, lower compensation, little influence within the institution, few if any benefits, and little protection of academic freedom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== United Kingdom ===
{{See also|Academic ranks in the United Kingdom|Lecturer}}
Academic tenure was eliminated in the United Kingdom in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/40/contents|title=Education Reform Act 1988|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-europe-does-academic-tenure-43362|title=Explainer: how Europe does academic tenure|last=Enders|first=Jürgen|work=The Conversation|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its place there is the distinction between permanent and temporary contracts for academics. A permanent lecturer in UK universities usually holds an open-ended position that covers teaching, research, and administrative responsibilities.

Research lecturers (where they are permanent appointments) are the equivalent in rank of lecturers and senior lecturers, but reflect a research-intensive orientation. Research lecturers are common in fields such as medicine, engineering, and biological and physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/UnitedKingdom|title=United Kingdom, Academic Career Structure|work=European University Institute|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Germany ===
{{See also|Habilitation#Germany|Academic ranks in Germany}}
Academics are divided into two classes. On the one hand, professors (C2/W2 positions in the old/new system of pay grades) are employed as civil servants of the state and hold tenure as a highly safeguarded employment for life. On the other, there is a much bigger group of "junior staff" on fixed-term contracts, research grants, fellowships, and part-time jobs. In 2010, 9% of academic staff were professors, 66% were "junior staff" (including doctoral candidates on contracts), and 25% were other academic staff in secondary employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buwin.de/dateien/2013/buwin2013keyresults.pdf/view|title=buwin2013keyresults.pdf — BuWiN 2017|website=www.buwin.de|language=de|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent research, teaching and management positions below professorship as an "Akademischer Rat" (a civil service position salaried like high school teachers) have become relatively rare compared to the 1970s and 1980s and are often no longer refilled after a retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/akademische-karrieren-manche-verteidigen-das-system-als-charakterbildend-/5942506-3.html|title=Prekäre Arbeitsverhältnisse an Universitäten nehmen zu
|language=de|access-date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to attain the position of Professor an academic must usually complete a "[[Habilitation]]" (a kind of broader second PhD thesis), after which she or he is eligible for tenureship. This means that, compared to other countries, academics in Germany obtain tenure at a relatively late age, as on average one becomes an Academic Assistant at the age of 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206154130/https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-europe-does-academic-tenure-43362|title=Explainer: how Europe does academic tenure|date=6 February 2018|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the "Juniorprofessur" position (comparable to an assistant professor in the US, but rarely endowed with a tenure track) was introduced as an alternative to "Habilitation". However, the degree of formal equivalence between a "Habilitation" and a successfully completed "Juniorprofessur" varies across the different states (''Bundesländer''), and the informal recognition of having served as a "Juniorprofessur" as a replacement for the "Habilitation" in the appointment procedures for professorships varies greatly between disciplines.

Due to a university system that guarantees universities relative academic freedom, the position of professor in Germany is stronger and more independent than, for instance, in France.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} As civil servants, professors have a series of attendant rights and benefits, yet this status is subject to discussion; for example, the question of relating professorial pay to performance rather than merely to age is now being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724064559/http://www.eui.eu:80/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/Germany.aspx#SecurityInThePosition|title=Germany, Academic Career Structure • European University Institute|date=24 July 2017|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments in favor ==
Many argue, among other things, that the job security granted by tenure is necessary to recruit talented individuals into professorships, because in many fields private industry jobs pay significantly more. 

== Arguments against ==
Some have argued that modern tenure systems diminish academic freedom, forcing those seeking tenured positions to profess conformance to the level of mediocrity as those awarding the tenured professorships. For example, according to physicist [[Lee Smolin]], "...it is practically career suicide for a young theoretical physicist not to join the field of [[string theory]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Trouble with Physics]]|author=Lee Smolin|date=2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-101835-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Economist [[Steven Levitt]], who recommends the elimination of tenure in order to incentivize higher performance among professors, also points out that a pay increase may be required to compensate faculty members for the lost job security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freakonomics.com/2007/03/03/lets-just-get-rid-of-tenure/|title=Let’s Just Get Rid of Tenure (Including Mine)|last1=Levitt|first1=Steven|authorlink=Steven Levitt|website=[[Freakonomics]]|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some U.S. states have considered legislation to remove tenure at public universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/13/legislation-two-states-seeks-eliminate-tenure-public-higher-education|title=Killing Tenure|last1=Flaherty|first1=Colleen|website=[[Inside Higher Ed]]|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A further criticism of tenure is that it rewards complacency. Once a professor is awarded tenure, he or she may begin putting reduced effort into their job, knowing that their removal is difficult or expensive to the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/07/study-links-tenure-criteria-long-term-professor-performance|title=Study links tenure criteria to long-term professor performance|website=Insidehighered.com|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the fourth husband of the journalist Olga Romanova, who has written for ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' about the ordeals experienced by her husband and herself, including the pressure on her to bribe officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.novayagazeta.ru/data/2011/044/02.html |accessdate=August 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704123209/http://en.novayagazeta.ru/data/2011/044/02.html |title=Latter-day "Decembrists' wives" |archivedate=July 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her evidence, as well as that of Yana Yakovleva of [[Business Solidarity]], has been used by the Helsinki Commission (see [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe]]) for a briefing on Russian corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://csce.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=ContentRecords.ViewDetail&amp;ContentRecord_id=960&amp;Region_id=101&amp;Issue_id=45&amp;ContentType=P&amp;CFID=43923068&amp;CFTOKEN=11706141 |title=Press Release: Helsinki Commission to Hold a Briefing on Russian Corruption |access-date=2011-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202633/http://csce.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=ContentRecords.ViewDetail&amp;ContentRecord_id=960&amp;Region_id=101&amp;Issue_id=45&amp;ContentType=P&amp;CFID=43923068&amp;CFTOKEN=11706141 |archive-date=2011-10-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kozlov and Romanova have accused [[Federation Council]] member Vladimir Slutsker of conspiring to have Kozlov jailed, and lodged a complaint to that effect with Russia's Prosecutor General, [[Yury Chaika]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/senator-accused-of-arranging-jail-term/415875.html Senator Accused of Arranging Jail Term] ''The Moscow Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman of Korfinans, he was arrested on 30 July 2008 and charged with the fraudulent acquisition of a factory in North West Moscow called 'Artificial Leather'. He was found guilty by the Moscow City Court and is serving a seven-year sentence at a penal colony in the Perm region.  He maintains his innocence, and that documentation supports his case, while arguing that he has the evidence of translators and notaries that documents used by the prosecution are forgeries. In July 2011 his prospects of release brightened when the Supreme Court ruled that he had not had a fair trial.&lt;ref name="themoscowtimes1"/&gt;

Earlier attempts to appeal his sentence had failed and the official volte face has been attributed by some to the influence of Medvedev, who according to Pavel K. Baev is 'sensitive to the impression that he has lost control over the marauding [[silovik]]i and is trying to compensate by making small steps that should prove his commitment to the rule of law.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38156&amp;cHash=091acfef55dcebeb8f8d463e2d292e8d The Jamestown Foundation: Medvedev and Putin Try In Vain to Shake the Siloviki Into Order]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kozlov has himself maintained a blog during his incarceration, called the 'Butyrka blog' ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:Бутырка-блог]]}})after the Moscow prison where he was initially detained. The blog, which several of those involved in [[human rights in Russia]] now contribute to, was awarded a [[Deutsche Welle]] prize in 2010.&lt;ref name="themoscowtimes1"&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/article/440220.html Prison Blogger Wins Appeal in Top Court] ''The Moscow Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Senior Fellow at the ''Ernst &amp; Young Institute for Emerging Market Studies''.

Professor Chattopadhyay is an authority on [[Brand management]] and the author of the award-winning book, [[#Book|The New Emerging Market Multinationals: Four Strategies for Disrupting Markets and Building Brands]].

Over the past three decades, he has published more than 60 articles, with the majority appearing in leading international journals such as the ''Journal of Marketing Research'', ''[[Journal of Consumer Research]]'', ''[[Journal of Marketing]]'', ''Journal of Consumer Psychology'', ''[[Marketing Science (journal)]]'',  ''[[Management Science (journal)]]'', ''International Journal of Research in Marketing'', and ''Long Range Planning''.

Prof. Chattopadhyay is on the editorial review boards of the ''Journal of Marketing'', ''Journal of Consumer Psychology'', ''International Journal of Research in Marketing'', ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science'', and ''Long Range Planning''. He has been on the Advisory Board of the [[Association for Consumer Research]] as well as the Association’s  Board of Directors. For his research, he has been the recipient of several awards, including the Robert Ferber Award.

Aside from degree programs, Chattopadhyay has taught in executive programs in Europe, North America, Australia, Asia, and Africa.  He is on the advisory boards of several companies and a consultant to multinational firms.

==Early life &amp; education==

Amitava has been a nomad all his life. He studied in five different schools in India and UK, from where he graduated high school from St. Gregory’s Grammar School in Manchester, UK.  Along the way he studied at [[Ballygunge Government High School (Kolkata)]], [[Don Bosco School, Park Circus, (Kolkata)]], [[Modern School (New Delhi)]], and in Swansea, UK. 
 
He later studied Chemistry at [[Jadavpur University]], a program from which he graduated at the top of his class in 1976, and went on to do his MBA (PGDP) from the [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], before heading off for his PhD in Marketing from the [[University of Florida]] in Gainesville, USA.

==Academic career==

Amitava started his academic career at [[McGill University]] in Montreal, Canada.{{fasct}} After eight years, the climate really got to him and he moved to the [[University of British Columbia]] in Vancouver, Canada.{{fact|date=August 2018}} Five years on, INSEAD came calling and Amitava moved to INSEAD in 1999.  Amitava started out in [[Fontainebleau]] but moved to the Singapore campus in 2005.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

==Key areas of research &amp; teaching==

Amitava has been interested throughout his career in consumers—what they think, how they feel, and how they respond to the various initiatives of businesses as they try to position themselves in the minds of consumers.

Amitava’s research has looked at how brands try to position themselves in consumers’ minds through [[advertising]], through word-of-mouth, through online platforms, through innovation in their product offerings, and through the use of various perceptual elements such as colors, visual aesthetics, music, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

| url         =    http://amitavac.com/papers/
}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work on the one hand has investigated how firm initiatives influence consumers’ thoughts and feelings, and how these in turn influence their preferences and purchase decisions.  On the other, his research has looked at how businesses can get better at developing the initiatives they target at customers through a variety of interventions in terms of the processes they follow and the tools they apply in generating consumer directed initiatives.
 
Most recently, Amitava has been struck by the rise of brand businesses from the emerging markets.  International business theory has maintained that emerging market firms make and sell low-cost inexpensive products or supply products and services to branded goods players in the developed markets, who then sell these under their own brand to end consumers around the world.  A good example of this model is [[FoxCom]] which makes many of the products that are sold under the Apple brand by Apple Inc.  However, the new millennium has seen the emergence of branded goods players from the emerging markets who are successfully building global branded businesses. Consider Taiwan’s [[HTC]] or China’s [[Haier]] and [[Lenovo]], or India’s [[Tata Motors]] (think [[Jaguar Cars]] and [[Land Rover]]) or [[Infosys]], or Turkey's [[TEMSA]] or [[VitrA (sanitaryware)|Vitra]], or Brazil’s [[Natura]] and [[WEG Industries]], or Mexico’s [[Grupo Modelo]] (think Corona).

Many, if not most of these names have become household names globally in the short course of a decade. These are but a small handful of the players from among a much larger group of companies that are today pouring out of the emerging markets to build global branded businesses, competing and winning against the entrenched global players from the developed world. 
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The question that intrigued me is how are these new emerging market competitors, businesses that are relatively speaking small and under-resourced, managing this feat?  A feat which they were not supposed to be able to achieve!  This is the focus of our book The New Emerging Market Multinationals: Four Strategies for Disrupting Markets and Building Brands.  The book was nominated by Strategy + Business as the Best Business Book on strategy for 2012.  I continue to be interested in this topic and am developing a series of case studies on Chinese companies as they appeared to be quite distinct when we were doing the research for The New Emerging Market Multinationals.''&lt;ref&gt;

==Book==
[[File:Emerging Market Multinationals (EMNC).png|thumb|right]]
In 2012, Amitava published his first book with McGraw-Hill, titled [https://www.amazon.com/The-New-Emerging-Market-Multinationals/dp/0071782893/ The New Emerging Market Multinationals: Four Strategies for Disrupting Markets and Building Brands]. The book is co-authored with Prof. Rajeev Batra (S.S. Kresge Professor of Marketing at the [[Ross School of Business]] at the [[University of Michigan]]), and Prof. Aysegul Ozsomer ([[Koç University]], Istanbul, Turkey).&lt;ref&gt;

| publisher   =    Amitava Chattopadhyay, Rajeev Batra, Aysegul Ozsomer
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The New Emerging Market Multinationals" is based on an in-depth study of 39 emerging market multinationals (EMNCs) that revealed innovative compete-from-below strategies and tactics fueling the meteoric rise of firms from countries such as India, China, Thailand, Turkey and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;

| title       =    BBC Interview
| url         =    http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00xvb6y
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was rated a top Strategy book of 2012 by [[Strategy+Business]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The New Emerging Market Multinationals is an important addition to the strategy bookshelf because it helps us understand the logic behind the rise of companies from emerging markets, including many new powerhouse firms in electronics, vehicles, services, healthcare, and other industries. The book serves a broader purpose as well, and reminds us of eternal strategic questions, such as how to identify, develop, and sustain a competitive advantage in crowded and unforgiving fields.''&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Averch–Johnson effect''' is the tendency of [[Monopoly#Government-granted_monopoly|regulated companies]] to engage in excessive amounts of [[capital accumulation]] in order to expand the volume of their profits. If companies' profits to [[Financial capital|capital]] ratio is regulated at a certain percentage then there is a strong incentive for companies to over-invest in order to increase profits overall. This investment goes beyond any optimal efficiency point for capital that the company may have calculated as higher profit is almost always desired over and above efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Averch |first=Harvey |last2=Johnson |first2=Leland L. |year=1962 |title=Behavior of the Firm Under Regulatory Constraint |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=1052–1069 |doi= |jstor=1812181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Excessive capital accumulation under rate of return regulation is informally known as ''''gold plating''''.&lt;ref name="Gold plating"&gt;{{cite news|last1=West|first1=Michael|title='Gold plating' rife, assets in for a hiding|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/gold-plating-rife-assets-in-for-a-hiding-20130131-2dmjg.html|accessdate=6 January 2015|agency=The Age|date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business process management''' ('''BPM''') is a discipline in [[operations management]] in which people use various methods to [[Business process discovery|discover]], [[Business process modeling|model]], [[Business analysis|analyze]], measure, improve, optimize, and [[Business process automation|automate]] business processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; BPM focuses on improving corporate performance by managing business processes.&lt;ref name="Panagacos2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AyCQMQEACAAJ|title=The Ultimate Guide to Business Process Management: Everything You Need to Know and How to Apply It to Your Organization|author=Theodore Panagacos|date=25 September 2012|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=978-1-4774-8613-9|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any combination of methods used to manage a company's business processes is BPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bpm.com/what-is-bpm|title=What Is BPM|last=Palmer|first=Nathaniel|website=bpm.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processes can be structured and repeatable or unstructured and variable. Though not required, enabling technologies are often used with BPM.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8Q6pAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=business+process+management&amp;ots=JFic1VgUHS&amp;sig=JefhVLYpfZ6hG-7_rrmWzqHqZiM#v=onepage&amp;q=business%20process%20management&amp;f=false|title=Business Process Management|last=Jeston|first=John|last2=Nelis|first2=Johan|date=2014-01-21|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136172984|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be differentiated from [[program management]] in that program management is concerned with managing a group of inter-dependent projects. From another viewpoint, process management includes program management. In [[project management]], process management is the use of a repeatable process to improve the outcome of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Thom |first1=William |year=2009 |title=People, Process, and Performance Management in Project Management |url=http://www.pmhut.com/people-process-and-performance-management-in-project-management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key distinctions between the process management and project management are repeatability and predictability. If the structure and sequence of work is unique, then it is a project. In business process management, sequence of work can vary from instance to instance: there are gateways, conditions; business rules etc. The key is predictability: no matter how many forks in the road, we know all of them in advance, and we understand the conditions for the process to take one route or another. If this condition is met, we are dealing with a process.{{cn|date=October 2018}} 

As an approach, BPM sees processes as important assets of an organization that must be understood, managed, and developed to announce and deliver value-added products and services to clients or customers. This approach closely resembles other [[total quality management]] or [[continual improvement process]] methodologies. [[ISO 9000]] promotes the process approach to managing an [[organization]].
&lt;blockquote&gt; ...promotes the adoption of a process approach when developing, implementing and
improving the effectiveness of a [[quality management]] system, to enhance [[customer satisfaction]] by meeting [[customer requirement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Source: clause 0.2 of ISO 9001:2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

BPM proponents also claim that this approach can be supported, or enabled, through technology.&lt;ref&gt;Managing Performance Through Business Processes, Dominique Thiault, {{ISBN|978-1-4680-2890-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, many BPM articles and scholars frequently discuss BPM from one of two viewpoints: people and/or technology.

==Definitions==

BPMInstitute defined Business process management as:

:: ...the definition, improvement and management of a firm's end-to-end enterprise business processes in order to achieve three outcomes crucial to a performance-based, customer-driven firm: 1) clarity on strategic direction, 2) alignment of the firm's resources, and 3) increased discipline in daily operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpminstitute.org/resources/articles/what-bpm-anyway-business-process-management-explained|title=What is BPM Anyway? Business Process Management Explained - BPMInstitute.org|website=www.bpminstitute.org|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Workflow Management Coalition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wfmc.org/what-is-bpm|title=What is BPM? - Workflow Management Coalition|first=Super|last=User|website=wfmc.org|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; BPM.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bpm.com/what-is-bpm|title=What Is BPM|first=Nathaniel|last=Palmer|website=bpm.com|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several other sources&lt;ref&gt;[The Complete Business Process Handbook Volume 1: 'Body of Knowledge from Process Modeling to BPM by Prof. [[August-Wilhelm Scheer]], Henrik von Scheel, Prof. Mark von Rosing, et al. ([[Morgan Kaufmann Publishers|Morgan Kaufmann]], {{ISBN|0128028602}}) [http://store.elsevier.com/The-Complete-Business-Process-Handbook/Mark-von-Rosing/isbn-9780127999593/]]&lt;/ref&gt; use the following definition:

:: Business process management (BPM) is a discipline involving any combination of modeling, automation, execution, control, measurement and optimization of business activity flows, in support of enterprise goals, spanning systems, employees, customers and partners within and beyond the enterprise boundaries.

The Association of Business Process Management Professionals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abpmp.org/?page=BPM_Profession|title=The BPM Profession - ABPMP International|website=www.abpmp.org|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines BPM as:

:: Business process management (BPM) is a disciplined approach to identify, design, execute, document, measure, monitor, and control both automated and non-automated business processes to achieve consistent, targeted results aligned with an organization’s strategic goals. BPM involves the deliberate, collaborative and increasingly technology-aided definition, improvement, innovation, and management of end-to-end business processes that drive business results, create value, and enable an organization to meet its business objectives with more agility. BPM enables an enterprise to align its business processes to its business strategy, leading to effective overall company performance through improvements of specific work activities either within a specific department, across the enterprise, or between organizations.

[[Gartner]] defines business process management as:
:: "the discipline of managing processes (rather than tasks) as the means for improving business performance outcomes and operational agility. Processes span organizational boundaries, linking together people, information flows, systems and other assets to create and deliver value to customers and constituents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gartner|title=Business process management (BPM)|url=http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/business-process-management-bpm/.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common to confuse BPM with a BPM suite (BPMS).   BPM is a professional discipline done by people, whereas  a BPMS is a technological suite of tools designed to help the BPM professionals accomplish their goals.  BPM should also not be confused with an application or solution developed to support a particular process.  Suites and solutions represent ways of automating business processes, but automation is only one aspect of BPM.

==Changes==
The concept of business process may be as traditional as concepts of [[Task (project management)|tasks]], [[departmentalization|department]], [[Production (economics)|production]], and [[output (economics)|output]]s, arising from [[job shop scheduling]] problems in the early 20th Century.&lt;ref name="Education1918"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States. Division of Vocational Education|title=Trade and Industrial Series ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3200AQAAMAAJ|year=1918|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The management and improvement approach {{As of| 2010 | lc = on}}, with formal definitions and technical modeling, has been around since the early 1990s (see [[business process modeling]]). Note that the term "business process" is sometimes used by IT practitioners as synonymous with the management of [[middleware]] processes or with integrating [[application software]] tasks.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Although BPM initially focused on the automation of business processes with the use of information technology, it has since been extended{{By whom|date=November 2010}} to integrate human-driven processes in which human interaction takes place in series or parallel with the use of technology. For example, [[workflow management system]]s can assign individual steps requiring deploying human intuition or judgment to relevant humans and other tasks in a workflow to a relevant automated system.&lt;ref&gt;"Automated workflows" http://www.automatedworkflows.com/services/custom-development/custom-automator-development/&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent variations such as "human interaction management"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://human-interaction-management.info/|accessdate=2013-08-16|title=Human Interaction: The Missing Link in BPM (Part I)|author=Keith Harrison-Broninski|date=2005-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://human-interaction-management.info/|title=HIM|accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; are concerned with the interaction between human workers performing a task.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

{{As of| 2010}} technology has allowed the coupling of BPM with other methodologies, such as [[Six Sigma]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Some BPM tools such as [[SIPOC]]s, [[workflow|process flow]]s, [[RACI matrix|RACI]]s, [[CTQ tree|CTQ]]s and [[histogram]]s allow users to:
* visualize – functions and processes
* measure – determine the appropriate measure to determine success
* analyze – compare the various simulations to determine an optimal improvement
* improve – select and implement the improvement
* control – deploy this implementation and by use of user-defined dashboards monitor the improvement in real time and feed the performance information back into the simulation model in preparation for the next improvement iteration
* re-engineer – revamp the processes from scratch for better results

This brings with it the benefit of being able to simulate changes to business processes based on real-world data (not just on assumed knowledge). Also, the coupling of BPM to industry methodologies allows users to continually streamline and optimize the process to ensure that it is tuned to its market need.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/common/ssi/sa/wh/n/wsw14044usen/WSW14044USEN.PDF Coupling BPM with Six Sigma]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}

{{As of | 2012}} research on BPM has paid increasing attention to the compliance of business processes. Although a key aspect of business processes is flexibility, as business processes continuously need to adapt to changes in the environment, compliance with business strategy, policies and government regulations should also be ensured.&lt;ref&gt;
Gong, Y. and Janssen, M. (2011). From policy implementation to business process management: Principles for creating flexibility and agility. Government Information Quarterly, 29 (Supplement 1), Pages S61-S71, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;
The compliance aspect in BPM is highly important for governmental organizations. {{As of | 2010}} BPM approaches in a governmental context largely focus on operational processes and knowledge representation.&lt;ref&gt;

There have been many technical studies on operational business processes in the public and private sectors, but researchers rarely take legal compliance activities into account—for instance the legal implementation processes in public-administration bodies.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Life-cycle==
Business process management activities can be arbitrarily grouped into categories such as design, modeling, execution, monitoring, and optimization.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Bayer, Harald Kühn (ed.): "Prozessmanagement für Experten - Impulse für aktuelle und wiederkehrende Themen", Springer-lVerlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Business Process Management Life-Cycle.svg|150px|right]]

===Design===
Process design encompasses both identification of existing processes and the design of "to-be" processes. Areas of focus include representation of the process flow, the factors within it, alerts and notifications, escalations, standard operating procedures, service level agreements, and task hand-over mechanisms. Whether or not existing processes are considered, the aim of this step is to ensure a correct and efficient new design.

The proposed improvement could be in human-to-human, human-to-system or system-to-system workflows, and might target regulatory, market, or competitive challenges faced by the businesses. Existing processes and design of new process for various applications must synchronize and not cause major outage or process interruption.

===Modeling===
Modeling takes the theoretical design and introduces combinations of variables (e.g., changes in rent or materials costs, which determine how the process might operate under different circumstances).

It may also involve running "what-if analysis"(Conditions-when, if, else) on the processes: ''"What if I have 75% of resources to do the same task?"'' ''"What if I want to do the same job for 80% of the current cost?"''.

===Execution===
{{original research|section|date=February 2015}}
Business process execution is broadly about enacting a discovered and modelled [[business process]]. Enacting a business process is done manually or automatically or with a combination of manual and automated business tasks. Manual business processes are human-driven. Automated business processes are software-driven. [[Business process automation]] encompasses methods and software deployed for automating business processes.

[[Business process automation]] is performed and orchestrated at the business process layer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/soa_refarch/p11.htm|title=SOA Reference Architecture –  Business Process Layer|website=www.opengroup.org|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the consumer presentation layer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/soa_refarch/p12.htm|title=SOA Reference Architecture –  Consumer Layer|website=www.opengroup.org|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of SOA Reference Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Service-oriented_architecture&amp;oldid=816628811|title=Service-oriented architecture|date=22 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2018|via=Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; BPM software suites such as BPMS or iBPMS or low-code platforms are positioned at the business process layer. While the emerging [[robotic process automation]] software performs business process automation at the presentation layer, therefore is considered non-invasive to and de-coupled from existing application systems.

One of the ways to automate processes is to develop or purchase an [[application software|application]] that executes the required steps of the process; however, in practice, these applications rarely execute all the steps of the process accurately or completely. Another approach is to use a combination of software and human intervention; however this approach is more complex, making the documentation process difficult.

In response to these problems, companies have developed software that defines the full business process (as developed in the process design activity) in a [[computer language]] that a computer can directly execute. Process models can be run through execution engines that automate the processes directly from the model (e.g., calculating a repayment plan for a loan) or, when a step is too complex to automate, [[Business Process Modeling Notation]] (BPMN) provides front-end capability for human input.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Larry Kerschberg [http://www.odesso.com/documents/processmodeling.doc INFS 770 – Methods for Information Systems Engineering: Knowledge Management and E-Business] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811042403/http://odesso.com/documents/processmodeling.doc# |date=11 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to either of the previous approaches, directly executing a process definition can be more straightforward and therefore easier to improve. However, automating a process definition requires flexible and comprehensive infrastructure, which typically rules out implementing these systems in a legacy IT environment.

[[Business rules]] have been used by systems to provide definitions for governing behavior, and a business rule engine can be used to drive process execution and resolution.

===Monitoring===
Monitoring encompasses the tracking of individual processes, so that information on their state can be easily seen, and statistics on the performance of one or more processes can be provided.  An example of this tracking is being able to determine the state of a customer order ''(e.g.'' order arrived, awaiting delivery, invoice paid) so that problems in its operation can be identified and corrected.

In addition, this information can be used to work with customers and suppliers to improve their connected processes.  Examples are the generation of measures on how quickly a customer order is processed or how many orders were processed in the last month. These measures tend to fit into three categories: cycle time, defect rate and productivity.

The degree of monitoring depends on what information the business wants to evaluate and analyze and how the business wants it monitored, in real-time, near real-time or ad hoc. Here, [[business activity monitoring]] (BAM) extends and expands the monitoring tools generally provided by BPMS.

[[Process mining]] is a collection of methods and tools related to process monitoring. The aim of process mining is to analyze event logs extracted through process monitoring and to compare them with an ''{{linktext|a priori}}'' process model. Process mining allows process analysts to detect discrepancies between the actual process execution and the ''a priori'' model as well as to analyze bottlenecks.

Predictive Business Process Monitoring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maggi| first1 = F.M. | last2 = Di Francescomarino| first2 = F. | last3 = Dumas | first3 = M. | last4 = Ghidini| first4 = C. | year = 2014 | title = Predictive monitoring of business processes | url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-07881-6_31 | journal = Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE) | pages = 457–472| doi=10.1007/978-3-319-07881-6_31| arxiv = 1312.4874}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerns the application of data mining, machine learning, and other forecasting techniques to predict what is going to happen with running instances of a business process, allowing to make forecasts of future cycle time, compliance issues, etc. Techniques for predictive business process monitoring include Support Vector Machines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cabanillas| first1 = C. | last2 =  Di Ciccio| first2 = C. | last3 = Mendling | first3 = J. | last4 = Baumgrass| first4 = A. | year = 2014 | title = Predictive Task Monitoring for Business Processes | url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10172-9_31 | journal = Proceedings of the International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM) | pages = 424–432| doi=10.1007/978-3-319-10172-9_31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Learning approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tax| first1 = N. | last2 = Verenich | first2 = I. | last3 = La Rosa | first3 = M. | last4 = Dumas | first4 = M. | year = 2017 | title = Predictive Business Process Monitoring with LSTM neural networks | url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-59536-8_30 | journal = Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE) | pages = 477–492| doi=10.1007/978-3-319-59536-8_30| arxiv = 1612.02130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Random Forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leontjeva| first1 = A. | last2 = Conforti| first2 = R. | last3 = Di Francescomarino | first3 = C. | last4 = Dumas | first4 = M. | last5 = La Rosa| first5 = M. | year = 2015 | title = Complex Symbolic Sequence Encodings for Predictive Monitoring of Business Processes | url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-23063-4_21 | journal = Proceedings of the International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM) | pages = 297–313| doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23063-4_21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optimization===
[[Process optimization]] includes retrieving process performance information from modeling or monitoring phase; identifying the potential or actual [[bottleneck (production)|bottlenecks]] and the potential opportunities for cost savings or other improvements; and then, applying those enhancements in the design of the process. Process mining tools are able to discover critical activities and bottlenecks, creating greater business value.&lt;ref name="s-cube"&gt;S-Cube Knowledge Model: [http://www.s-cube-network.eu/km/terms/b/business-process-optimization Business Process Optimization].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-engineering===
When the process becomes too complex or inefficient, and optimization is not fetching the desired output, it is usually recommended by a company steering committee chaired by the president / CEO to re-engineer the entire process cycle. [[Business process reengineering]] (BPR) has been used by organizations to attempt to achieve efficiency and productivity at work.

==Suites==
A market has developed for [[enterprise software]] leveraging the business process management concepts to organize and automate processes. The recent convergence of these software from distinct pieces such as [[business rules engine]], [[business process modelling]], [[business activity monitoring]] and Human Workflow has given birth to integrated Business Process Management Suites.
[[Forrester Research]], Inc recognize the BPM suite space through three different lenses: 
* human-centric BPM
* integration-centric BPM (Enterprise Service Bus)
* document-centric BPM (Dynamic Case Management)

However, standalone integration-centric and document-centric offerings have matured into separate, standalone markets.

[[Rapid application development]] using no-code/low-code principles is becoming an ever prevalent feature of BPMS platforms.{{cn|date=August 2018}} RAD enables businesses to deploy applications more quickly and more cost effectively, while also offering improved change and version management.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Gartner notes that as businesses embrace these systems, their budgets rely less on maintenance of existing systems and show more investment in growing and transforming them.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Practice==
[[File:BPM Workflow Service Pattern.gif|thumb|360px|Example of Business Process Management (BPM) Service Pattern: This pattern shows how business process management (BPM) tools can be used to implement business processes through the orchestration of activities between people and systems.&lt;ref&gt;NIH (2007). [https://enterprisearchitecture.nih.gov/Pages/WorkflowServicePattern.aspx Business Process Management (BPM) Service Pattern] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415171652/https://enterprisearchitecture.nih.gov/Pages/WorkflowServicePattern.aspx# |date=15 April 2012 }}. Accessed 29 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While the steps can be viewed as a cycle, economic or time constraints are likely to limit the process to only a few iterations.  This is often the case when an organization uses the approach for short to medium term objectives rather than trying to transform the organizational culture.  True iterations are only possible through the collaborative efforts of process participants.  In a majority of organizations, complexity requires enabling technology (see below) to support the process participants in these daily process management challenges.

To date, many organizations often start a BPM project or program with the objective of optimizing an area that has been identified as an area for improvement.

Currently, the international standards for the task have limited BPM to the application in the IT sector, and ISO/IEC 15944 covers the operational aspects of the business. However, some corporations with the culture of [[best practices]] do use [[standard operating procedures]] to regulate their operational process.&lt;ref name=ippc&gt;NTAID (2008). [http://www.niaid.nih.gov/ncn/sop/contracts/invoice.htm Invoice Processing Procedures for Contracts] Accessed 17 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other standards are currently being worked upon to assist in BPM implementation ([[BPMN]], [[enterprise architecture]], [[Business Motivation Model]]).

===Technology===
BPM is now considered a critical component of [[operational intelligence]] (OI) solutions to deliver real-time, actionable information. This real-time information can be acted upon in a variety of ways – alerts can be sent or executive decisions can be made using real-time dashboards. OI solutions use real-time information to take automated action based on pre-defined rules so that security measures and or exception management processes can be initiated.
Because "the size and complexity of daily tasks often requires the use of technology to model efficiently" when resources in technology became increasingly widespread with general availability to businesses to provide to their staff, "Many thought BPM as the bridge between Information Technology (IT) and Business."&lt;ref name="Singh2009"&gt;{{cite book

There are four critical components of a BPM Suite:
* Process engine – a robust platform for modeling and executing process-based applications, including business rules
* Business analytics – enable managers to identify business issues, trends, and opportunities with reports and dashboards and react accordingly
* Content management – provides a system for storing and securing electronic documents, images, and other files
* Collaboration tools – remove intra- and interdepartmental communication barriers through discussion forums, dynamic workspaces, and message boards

BPM also addresses many of the critical IT issues underpinning these business drivers, including:
* Managing end-to-end, customer-facing processes
* Consolidating data and increasing visibility into and access to associated data and information
* Increasing the flexibility and functionality of current infrastructure and data
* Integrating with existing systems and leveraging [[service oriented architecture]] (SOA)
* Establishing a common language for business-IT alignment

Validation of BPMS is another technical issue that vendors and users must be aware of, if regulatory compliance is mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM072322.pdf |title=Guidance for Industry. Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures — Scope and Application |accessdate=2009-07-20 |date = August 2003|format=PDF |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The validation task could be performed either by an authenticated third party or by the users themselves.  Either way, validation documentation must be generated. The validation document usually can either be published officially or retained by users.

===Cloud computing BPM===
'''Cloud computing business process management''' is the use of (BPM) tools that are delivered as [[Software as a service|software services]] (SaaS) over a network. Cloud BPM business logic is deployed on an application server and the business data resides in [[cloud storage]].

====Market====
According to Gartner, 20% of all the "shadow business processes" are supported by BPM cloud platforms{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}. Gartner refers to all the hidden organizational processes that are supported by IT departments as part of legacy business processes such as Excel spreadsheets, routing of emails using rules, phone calls routing, etc. These can, of course also be replaced by other technologies such as [[workflow management system|workflow]]  and [[SmartForm|smart form software]].

====Benefits====
The benefits of using cloud BPM services include removing the need and cost of maintaining specialized technical skill sets in-house and reducing distractions from an enterprise's main focus. It offers controlled IT budgeting and enables geographical mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://projects.aifb.kit.edu/bpmc2013/index.htm|title = 1st International Workshop on Business Process Management in the Cloud|publisher = KIT|date = 26 August 2013 |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=July 2014}}.

===Internet of things===

The emerging [[Internet of things]] poses a significant challenge to control and manage the flow of information through large numbers of devices.  To cope with this, a new direction known as [[BPM Everywhere]] shows promise as way of blending traditional process techniques, with additional capabilities to automate the handling of all the independent devices.

A '''cashless society''' describes an economic state whereby [[financial transaction]]s are not conducted with money in the form of physical [[banknote]]s or coins, but rather through the transfer of digital information (usually an electronic representation of money) between the transacting parties.&lt;ref name="THE COST OF CASH IN THE UNITED STATES"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fletcher.tufts.edu/CostofCash/~/media/Fletcher/Microsites/Cost%20of%20Cash/CostofCashStudyFinal.pdf|publisher=The Fletcher School Tufts University |title=THE COST OF CASH IN THE UNITED STATES|page=9 |accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cashless societies have existed from the time when human society came into existence, based on [[barter]] and other methods of exchange, and cashless transactions have also become possible in modern times using [[digital currencies]] such as [[bitcoin]]. However this article discusses and focuses on the term "cashless society" in the sense of a move towards, and implications of, a society where cash is replaced by its [[digital currency|digital equivalent]] - in other words, [[legal tender]] (money) exists, is recorded, and is exchanged only in electronic digital form.

Such a concept has been discussed widely, particularly because the world is experiencing a rapid and increasing use of digital methods of recording, managing, and exchanging money in [[commerce]], [[investment banking|investment]] and daily life in many parts of the world, and transactions which would historically have been undertaken with cash are often now undertaken electronically.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/04/sweden-cashless-society-cards-phone-apps-leading-europe https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/04/sweden-cashless-society-cards-phone-apps-leading-europe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uk-cashless"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-moves-towards-cashless-society-10267215.html UK moves towards cashless society]&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries now set limits on transactions and transaction values for which non-electronic payment may be legally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cashless-society.org/|title=Cashless-Society.org|website=Cashless-Society.org|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The trend towards use of non-cash transactions and settlement began in daily life during the 1990s, when electronic banking became popular. By the 2010s digital payment methods were widespread in many countries, with examples including intermediaries such as [[PayPal]], [[digital wallet]] systems operated by companies like [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], contactless and [[Near field communication|NFC]] payments by electronic card or [[smartphone]], and electronic bills and banking, all in widespread use.&lt;ref name="uk-cashless" /&gt; By the 2010s cash had become actively disfavored in some kinds of transaction which would historically have been very ordinary to pay with physical tender, and larger cash amounts were in some situations treated with suspicion, due to its versatility and ease of use in [[money laundering]] and [[financing of terrorism]], and actively prohibited by some suppliers and retailers,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2016/09/04/cash-cashless-society-credit-cards/89726644/  A cashless society? Some retailers turn their noses up at currency]&lt;/ref&gt; to the point of coining the expression of a "war on cash".&lt;ref&gt;[https://professorwerner.wordpress.com/2016/02/09/negative-interest-rates-and-the-war-on-cash Negative Interest Rates and the War on Cash]&lt;/ref&gt; 
By 2016 in the United Kingdom it was reported that 1 in 7 people no longer carries or uses cash.&lt;ref name=TheSun001&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2034280/one-in-seven-brits-no-longer-carries-cash-as-we-become-increasingly-reliant-on-card-and-smartphone-payments/|author=Alex West |publisher=The Sun |website=thesun.co.uk |title=One in seven Brits no longer carries cash, as we become increasingly reliant on card and smartphone payments |date=23 October 2016 |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 2016 United States User Consumer Survey Study claims that 75% of respondents preferred a credit or debit card as their payment method while only 11% of respondents preferred cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsys.com/Assets/TSYS/downloads/rs_2016-us-consumer-payment-study.pdf|title=2016 User Consumer Study|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By 2017, digital payment methods such as [[Venmo]] and [[Square, Inc.|Square]] contribute to cashless transactions. 
Venmo allows individuals to make direct payments to other individuals without having cash accessible. 
Square is an innovation that allows primarily small businesses to receive payments from their clients.

==Concerns==
{{POV section|date=April 2018}} &lt;!-- needs some perspective from advocates of cashlessness, more neutral phrasing--&gt;
It has also been described as a highly controversial and at times a "sinister" or "creepy" move and as a concept connected to negative interest rates, banking transaction tax and a global taxation regime,&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-14/the-cashless-society-is-a-creepy-fantasy The Cashless Society Is a Creepy Fantasy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/08/the_sinister_side_of_a_cashless_society.html The Sinister Side of a Cashless Society]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dnaindia"&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/column-banking-transaction-tax-is-a-dangerous-idea-1959448 Banking Transaction Tax is a Dangerous Idea]&lt;/ref&gt; since such a move would be both potentially useful and potentially socially dangerous, with widespread implications for society. It has potential to be very helpful for central governments and economies, in the context of global [[negative inflation]] and [[quantitative easing]], and central control of the [[money supply]]. However a loss of cash also transfers complete control of transactions, interest, and individual use of money, and information about these, to the [[nation state]] and third party providers, since the individual cannot avoid their money being held in an external system capable of regulation and control. Many countries have regulated, restricted, or banned private digital currencies such as [[Legality of bitcoin by country|Bitcoin]]. While supposedly helpful to the global economy and in fighting against crime and terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-sinister-side-of-cash-1472137692 The Sinister Side of Cash]&lt;/ref&gt; many concerns have been raised over "dangerous" [[unintended consequences]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fastcoexist.com/3056736/what-happens-when-we-become-a-cashless-society What Happens When We Become A Cashless Society?]&lt;/ref&gt; It would mean that negative interest rates can be fully enforced, and money could be controlled in great detail. For example, some kinds of money might be set to "expire" and be worthless if not spent in specific ways or by specific times, or to devalue gradually. It also makes individual savings, and information about individual incomes and transactions, accessible to any party able to access the records - either legitimately (police and tax related) or not (hackers and persons with access to the relevant data), and in this way, it facilitates [[mass surveillance|population surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/02/economics-professor-negative-interest-rates-aimed-driving-small-banks-business-eliminating-cash.html Economics Professor: Negative Interest Rates Aimed at Driving Small Banks Out of Business and Eliminating Cash]&lt;/ref&gt; It also means that groups, individuals, and causes could be deprived of cash by the simple expedient of preventing their access to cashless transaction media.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1" /&gt; A cashless society is convenient and fast; however, it also increases ignorance to individual spending and vulnerability to fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?EbscoContent=dGJyMNLe80SeprU4wtvhOLCmr0%2BeqLFSr6u4S7eWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGpsUm0qq5NuePfgeyx847f1d%2BI5wAA&amp;T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;S=R&amp;D=bth&amp;K=125099819|title=Consumers' Attitude and Perception towards Doing Cashless Transactions: An Empirical Study in Vadodara|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers' ignorance to spending increases as they are less aware when swiping their card to complete a transaction than if they budgeted their money and paid in cash.  Their vulnerability to fraud increases because corporations keep record of credit and debit card transactions, but they don't keep a record of cash transactions. The two main types of credit card fraud are when thieves attain the data manually or through a concealed automated program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lydia|first=Segal,|last2=Benjamin|first2=Ngugi,|last3=Jafar|first3=Mana,|date=2011|title=Credit Card Fraud: A New Perspective On Tackling An Intransigent Problem|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/jcfl/vol16/iss4/2/|journal=Fordham Journal of Corporate &amp; Financial Law|language=en|volume=16|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of a cashless society ==
=== Efficient and convenient ===
Going digital helps to reduce the hassle of drawing cash or making sure that cash-in-hand is sufficient to make a payment in places where only cash payment is allowed. A digitalized payment system speeds up the process of financial transaction and boosts the efficiency of the transaction. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.todayonline.com/commentary/inclusivity-key-success-cashless-drive|title=Inclusivity the key to success of cashless drive |last=Auyong|first=Hawyee |date= 4 September 2017|work=Today|access-date=10 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased transparency===
As monetary transactions are being made electronically, it increases the transparency as financial transaction are recorded. The cashless system will assist a wide range of institutions and these includes: 

==== Government bodies====
Rather than conducting costly and periodic surveys and sampling of real-world transactions, real data collected on citizen’s spending can assist in devising and implementing policies that are deduced from actual data. With recorded financial transactions, Government can better track the movement of the money through financial records which enables them to track the black money and illegal transactions taking place in the country. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/why-singapore-government-adamant-going-090020456.html|title=Why is the Singapore Government So Adamant About Going Cashless |last=Poh|first=Joanne |date=17 October 2017|work=YahooFinance|access-date=10 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

====Businesses====
Cashless payments would eliminate the fear of businesses receiving counterfeit money and flush out illegal cash. The risks of storing cash will also be reduced as payments are made digitally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-17/going-cashless-bad-for-tax-cheats-privacy-poor-quicktake-q-a|title= Going Cashless? Bad for Tax Cheats, Privacy, Poor |last=Sivabalan|first= Srinivasan |date=17 July 2017|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|access-date=10 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Easier tracking ===
As digital payments are made, transactions are kept in records. Cashless payments facilitate the tracking of spending expenditure and record the movement of money. Having recorded transactions, it can help citizens to refine their budget more efficiently.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.asiaone.com/business/ignoring-one-point-about-cashless-society-could-have-huge-impact-singaporeans-finance|title=Ignoring this one point about a cashless society could have a huge impact on Singaporeans’ finance |last=Poh|first=Joanne |date=16 September 2017|work=asiaone|access-date=10 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Perils of a cashless society ==
=== The issue on privacy ===
In a digitized economy, payment made will be traceable. With traceable transactions, institutions would have potential access to this information. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/money/commentisfree/2016/mar/21/fear-cashless-world-contactless |title= Why we should fear a cashless world |last= Frisby |first=Dominic |date= 21 March 2016|work= The Guardian|access-date= 8 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these digital traces left behind, digital transactions become vulnerable. Such transactions allow businesses a way to build a consumer’s personal profiles based on their spending patterns. The issue of [[data mining]] also come into place as countries head towards a cashless society. Cashless transactions leave a record in the database of the company as one make payment, and this information becomes a way for prediction of future events. Through large number of records, data mining then allows the organization to compile a profile of an individual through its' records in the database. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catherine|first=Downey| date=1996|title= The High Price of a Cashless Society: Exchanging Privacy Rights for Digital Cash, 14J. Marshall J. Computer &amp; Info. L. 303 (1996)|url=https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com.sg/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1312&amp;context=jitpl|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Going all-digital, these data retrieved from transactions lead to widespread surveillance where individuals can be tracked by both the corporations and state. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Dwyer|first= Rachel|editor1-last=Gloerich |editor1-first= Inte|editor2-last=Lovink |editor2-first=Geert|editor3-last=De Vries |editor3-first=Paricia|date=2018|title= MoneyLab, Overcoming the Hype|publisher=Institute of Network Cultures, Amsterdam | page= 151| language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
=== Exclusion of certain population ===
Implementing cashless systems excludes the involvement of certain populations such as the poor, near poor, and elderly. Heading towards a cashless society, citizens that do not hold the power or knowledge of engaging in digital transactions are left behind. To be able to transact using e-payment, it requires one to hold a bank account, which can hold their money. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://dollarsandsense.sg/going-cashless-whos-left-behind |title= Going Cashless: Who’s Left Behind |last=Ng |first=Nicole |date= 22 September 2017 |work= Dollars And Sense |access-date= 8 April 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many of these impoverished people are underbanked. In America, almost one-third of the population lacked the full range of basic financial services. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://business.time.com/2012/11/20/why-so-many-americans-dont-have-bank-accounts |title= Why So Many Americans Don't have Bank Accounts |last=Sivy |first= Michael |date= 20 November 2012 |work= TIME |access-date= 8 April 2018 |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to FDIC data, among household that earn an annual income of less than $15,000 per year, almost 25.6% of the households do not have a bank account. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burhouse|first=Susan| last2= Chu|first2=Karyen| date= 20 October 2016|title=2011 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households |url= https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/2015/2015report.pdf|access-date= 8 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the older generation, especially retired seniors who are less familiarised with technology and digital applications, it will be hard for them to adopt the digital system. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.straitstimes.com/forum/letters-on-the-web/going-cashless-in-phases-will-help-elderly |title= Going cashless in phases will help elderly |last=Sim |first=Joachim |date= 31 August 2017|work= The Straits Times|access-date= 8 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of such example would be Singapore. As a [[Smart Nation]] Initiative, Singapore has been moving towards a cashless system. In Singapore, there are at least half a million elderlies, aged 65 and above, and this accounts for 14.4 percent of the total population in Singapore. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-ageing-at-faster-pace-than-a-decade-ago|title= Singapore ageing at faster pace than a decade ago |last=Toh|first=Elgin |date=28 September 2017|work= The Straits Times|access-date= 8 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most seniors in Singapore still use cash as their only mode of payment and the integration of cashless payment creates a barrier for them. Not used to digitized payment methods, troubleshooting issues such as managing lost cards or passwords and managing their expenses can create potential troubles for these elderlies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/govt-will-seek-ensure-no-one-left-behind-cashless-drive|title= Govt will seek to ensure no one is left behind in cashless drive |last=Mokhtar|first=Faris |date=28 August 2017|work= Today|access-date= 8 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breaching/Hacking of the system ===
When payment transactions are stored in servers, it increases the risks of unauthorized breachers and hackers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Domagoj|first=Sajter| date=2011|title=Privacy, Identity, and the Perils of the Cashless Society |url=http://www.chronosmag.eu/files/chronosmag/contentVOL25/Sajter-Privacy-SSRN-id2285438.pdf|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial cyber attacks and digital crime also form a greater risks when going cashless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Dwyer|first= Rachel|editor1-last=Gloerich |editor1-first= Inte|editor2-last=Lovink |editor2-first=Geert|editor3-last=De Vries |editor3-first=Paricia|date=2018|title= MoneyLab, Overcoming the Hype|publisher=Institute of Network Cultures, Amsterdam | page= 151| language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of such example would be [[Forever 21]], whom released a statement reporting the findings from their investigation of a payment card security incident. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.forever21.com/protecting_our_customers/default.aspx|title= Forever 21 Reports Findings from Investigation of Payment Security Incident | access-date=10 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Forever 21 encountered a breached of their payment system by hackers for 7 months. As the [[encryption]] in some of their [[point-of-sale]] terminals were not on, it opened up their [[point-of-sales]] terminal to malware. The hackers obtain the network access and installed malware that allowed them to retrieve the card details of Forever 21’s consumers. Due to this invasion, the hackers obtained access to consumers’ payment card data for up to seven months - from 3 April 2017 to 18 November 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.csoonline.com/article/3245069/security/forever-21-hackers-breached-payment-system-for-7-months-no-encryption-on-pos-devices.html |title=Forever 21: Hackers breached payment system for 7 months |last=Smith| date= 1 December 2018|work=CSO|access-date=10 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

These open transactions also create the dangers and security issues where unauthorized access to users’ account occurs and funds are transferred to another account or unauthorized purchases are made by unknown user as they pose as the true user. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catherine|first=Downey| date=1996|title= The High Price of a Cashless Society: Exchanging Privacy Rights for Digital Cash, 14J.

==Amount of cash in circulation==

Even though cashless society is widely discussed most countries are increasing their currency supply. The table below is taken from the red books for members of the [[Bank for International Settlements]], which includes most of the major fiat currencies of the world. Exceptions are South Africa whose supply of banknotes fluctuates wildly compared to most nations and Sweden which is drastically reducing its currency supply since 2007,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d155.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The values in the table are "per capita" so they already are scaled to population changes. But even the smallest increases of 3% per year are much higher than any possible GDP growth.

==Cashless transactions vs reduced cash==
A common measure of how close to a "cashless society" a country is becoming is some measure of the number of cashless payments or person to person transactions are done in that country. For instance the Nordic countries conduct more cashless transactions than most Europeans.

''Across the 33 countries covered in the European Payment Cards Yearbook 2015-16, the average number of card payments per capita per year is 88.4. In comparison, the average Dane makes 268.6 card payments each year, the average Finn 243.6, the average Icelander 375.5, the average Norwegian 353.7 and the average Swede 270.2. This makes card payments in the Nordics two-and a-half to four times higher than the European average.'' &lt;ref&gt;
http://www.euromonitor.com/financial-cards-and-payments-in-denmark/report&lt;/ref&gt;

But cash can also function as a "store of value" just like commodities like diamonds, gold, silver, and platinum or real estate and antiques. Levels of cash in circulation can widely differ among two countries with similar measure of cashless transactions. For example, Denmark has more than double the amount of cash in circulation as Sweden and a considerably higher percent in the largest denomination banknote, the 1000kr bill.

South Korea has made the decision to end coins as legal tender by 2020. So if you conduct an all cash transaction you must forego any change in amounts of less than the value of the smallest banknote, ₩1000, or slightly less than US$1. This change will undoubtedly greatly increase the number of electronic transactions in the country, but the wide circulation of the ₩50,000 bill, the largest denomination banknote, will mean that citizens can still easily use cash as a convenient store of value.

The largest denomination banknote of any currency is often associated with criminal activity, counterfeiting, or tax evasion. 
The United Kingdom declared only banknotes of 5 pounds or less were legal tender after WWII because of fear of Nazi counterfeiting. 
In 1969 in the USA the government declared that banknotes of value over $100 would remain legal tender, but any notes in government hands would be destroyed and that no new notes of those denominations would be printed in the future. Such notes were last printed in the USA in 1945. 
Canada did the same thing with the CAD$1000 banknote in the year 2000. Sweden printed 10,000kr banknotes in 1939 and 1958 but declared them invalid after 31 December 1991. Singapore has recently announced that they would no longer produce the SGD$10,000 banknote. The Euro Area has announced that the €500 denomination banknote would not be included in the next series of banknotes. The ECB has not announced if it intends to reduce the amount of cash in circulation, or to simply replace that value with smaller denominations.

==Biography==

Claudio Rangel has been President and Executive Creative Director of Range.mbs Group for 11 years. During his 20+year career he has dedicated himself to the development of [[art]] and photography in São Paulo receiving the Academic Cross of FALASP – Academic Federation of Arts and Letters of The State of São Paulo in 2007 for his lifetime contribution in the field of Arts and [[Advertising]].

==Early career==

Claudio’s career began in 1982 in Rio de Janeiro, as a Junior [[Art Director]] at INARP Propaganda. At 20 years of age, he was Art Director of DM9 Advertising in [[Salvador, Bahia]], working on the campaign of the former President of Brazil.  Soon after he moved to São Paulo and worked for some of the most prestigious international agencies in the city, starting at MPM Propaganda, creating major campaigns for [[Fiat]] Motors and the City of São Paulo.

At 26 years old, he became creative director of FG Publicidade in São Paulo where his work was selected for the short list (10 best in the world) at [[Cannes Lions]] International award with the campaign “Silent” for Consul Air Conditioners. Also worked at international agencies such as, Wunderman Cato Johnson, [[Young &amp; Rubicam]], and Neogama BBH.

From 1993 to 97 he worked at Wunderman Cato Johnson in São Paulo and Miami offices. In 1997, he came back to Brazil where he was hired at [[Leo Burnett]] where soon after he was selected to represent the Brazilian office in the international elite team called “Magnificent Seven” who were responsible for creating campaigns for major international clients like [[Coca-Cola]], [[Johnnie Walker]], [[Kellogg's]] and Fiat. For Fiat, Claudio also created the new worldwide logo. Hired by [[Bozell Worldwide]] in 1998, he created the campaign to launch in the Brazilian Market the new [[Dodge Dakota]], and several other cars from [[Chrysler]], [[Jeep]] and [[Dodge]] (The Chrysler Group) in the same year he was hired to work for the most awarded agency in South America and one of the leading in the world, W/BRASIL (now [[W/McCann]]).

In 2000 after leaving W/BRASIL he worked briefly for Neogama BBH ([[Bartle Bogle Hegarty]]). Also in 2000 he was hired to work as a Creative Director at Carillo, Pastore [[Euro RSCG]] to launch the new [[Peugeot]] Cars (307, 407, 507’s). In 2001 he left the Euro RSCG to open his own agency RANGEL.MBS COMUNICAÇÕES, where he quickly acquired important accounts such as [[Hertz]] Car Rental, [[Marriott Hotels &amp; Resorts|Marriott]] and [[Renaissance Hotels]], Editora Abril, Viagem &amp; Turismo Magazine, [[National Geographic Magazine]], [[Umbra]], Silit, Simple Human, Messe Frankfurt.

==U.S. career==

In 2007 he opened the first international office (Range.mbs Inc) located in Miami, Florida in partnership with Beber Silverstein Group. In the U.S. he continued his work for Hertz and acquired more accounts such as Ruekert Pharmaceutical, GRG Realty, Timberlake Church, BR Advisors, ETC Kitchen Products and Mast General Construction. In 2011 he was hired by [[Caesars Entertainment Corporation|Caesars Entertainment]] (a worldwide leader in gaming and entertainment) to be the Lead Group Graphic Designer at the Las Vegas Corporate Office.

At Caesars Entertainment, Claudio was responsible for launching the new [[Total Rewards]], the biggest entertainment/casino loyalty program in the world, with a large national campaign with simultaneous launches in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and New Orleans. He also redesigned the Rio All-Suites Hotel &amp; Casino logo. Claudio also created their local campaign and was subsequently awarded with a bronze medal at the [[Addy Awards]].

Claudio also coordinated the launch of the new Caesars Palace Campaign and directed the creative to redesign all the Caesars Palace internal materials. Later in 2011 opened the Las Vegas office of RANGEL.MBS (RANGEL.MBS LLC) to work with Caesars Entertainment and its brands: [[Caesars Palace]], [[Harrah's]] Casinos, [[Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino|Imperial Palace]], [[Bill's Gamblin' Hall]], [[Paris Las Vegas]], [[Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino]], [[Bally's]], Horseshoe Casinos, Rio All-Suite Hotel &amp; Casino and [[Total Rewards]]. For Total Rewards he coordinated the creative for nationwide launch. Concerts in 5 Major cities, with a countdown clock on the Nasdaq Building. His work for Caesars Entertainment had a quick response winning several awards in the first 6 months of work for them. In 2012 he opened Rangel Photography, a new enterprise focused in the casino side of the photography business to complement the array of options offered by his group to its clients.

==Social responsibility==

Claudio Rangel and Rangel.mbs worked in support of the City São Paulo Social Assistant Secretary in a project (PROJETO OFICINA BORACEA) giving  trash recyclers the opportunity to be included in the professional market, teaching them new techniques of recycling, how to trade and commercialize their “merchandise” and also how they use their profit to change their lives. Claudio used his advertising skills to create an ad campaigns to bring awareness to the city that they could invest in this project that would ultimately help to lower the gap between economic classes and create a better future for those in need.

In addition to being a recognized award-winning advertising professional, Claudio Rangel, in his unwavering dedication to social causes in his home country and in the United States, also participates in programs such as [[Feed the Children]] and [[Compassion International]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3188">{{Crystallization}}

The '''crystal bar process''' (also known as '''iodide process''' or the '''van Arkel&amp;ndash;de Boer process''') was developed by [[Anton Eduard van Arkel]] and [[Jan Hendrik de Boer]] in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/zaac.19251480133 | title =  Darstellung von reinem Titanium-, Zirkonium-, Hafnium- und Thoriummetall | first = A. E. | last = van Arkel |author2=de Boer, J. H. | volume = 148 | issue = 1 | pages =345–350 | year = 1925 | journal = Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process was the first industrial process for the commercial production of pure ductile metallic [[zirconium]]. It is used in the production of small quantities of ultra-pure titanium and zirconium. It primarily involves the formation of the metal iodides and their subsequent decomposition to yield pure metal. This process was superseded commercially by the [[Kroll process]].

==Process==
[[File:Van-Arkel-de-Boer-Apparat.png|thumb|left|An apparatus used for the crystal bar process. The main body is made of [[quartz glass]]. (1) to vacuum pump, (2) 6 mm molybdenum electrode, (3) molybdenum net, (4) chamber for the raw metal, (5) tungsten wire]]

[[File:Van-Arkel-de-Boer-Verfahren.svg|350px|thumb|The crystal bar process. ''M'' refers to ''metal'']]

As seen in the diagram below, impure [[titanium]], [[zirconium]], [[hafnium]], [[vanadium]], [[thorium]] or [[protactinium]] is heated in an evacuated vessel with a halogen at 50–250&amp;nbsp;°C. The patent specifically involved the intermediacy of [[titanium tetraiodide|TiI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[zirconium tetraiodide|ZrI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], which were volatilized (leaving impurities as solid). At atmospheric pressure TiI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; melts at 150&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at 377&amp;nbsp;°C, while ZrI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; melts at 499&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at 600&amp;nbsp;°C. The boiling points are lower at reduced pressure. The gaseous metal tetraiodide is decomposed on a white hot tungsten filament (1400&amp;nbsp;°C). As more metal is deposited the filament conducts better and thus a greater electric current is required to maintain the temperature of the filament. The process can be performed in the span of several hours or several weeks, depending on the particular setup.

Generally, the crystal bar process can be performed using any number of metals using whichever halogen or combination of halogens is most appropriate for that sort of transport mechanism, based on the reactivities involved. The only metals it has been used to purify on an industrial scale are titanium, zirconium and hafnium, and in fact is still in use today on a much smaller scale for special purity needs.

A '''decentralized autonomous organization''' ('''DAO'''), sometimes labeled a '''decentralized autonomous corporation''' ('''DAC'''), is an [[organization]] represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by shareholders and not influenced by a central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Prusty |first=Narayan |date=27 Apr 2017 |title=Building Blockchain Projects |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=80EwDwAAQBAJ |location=Birmingham, UK |publisher=Packt |page=9 |isbn=9781787125339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3082055 The Decentralized Autonomous Organization and Governance Issues] ''Regulation of Financial Institutions Journal'': Social Science Research Network (SSRN). 5 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; A DAO's financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]].&lt;ref name=Vigna20150127/&gt;{{rp|229}}&lt;ref name=Hodson20131120/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist20160521/&gt; The precise legal status of this type of business organization is unclear.&lt;ref name=Popper20160521/&gt;

A well-known example, intended for venture capital funding, was [[The DAO (organization)|The DAO]], which launched with $150 million in crowdfunding in June 2016, and was immediately hacked and drained of {{USD|50 million}}&lt;!-- approximate US dollar value of the drained Ether --&gt; in [[cryptocurrency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital currency Ethereum is cratering amid claims of a $50 million hack|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/dao-hacked-ethereum-crashing-in-value-tens-of-millions-allegedly-stolen-2016-6|first=Rob|last=Price|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=17 June 2016|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hack was reversed in the following weeks, and the money restored, via a hard fork of the [[Ethereum]] blockchain. This bailout was made possible by the Ethereum miners and clients switching to the new fork.&lt;ref name=daobail /&gt;

== Background ==
Decentralized autonomous organizations are typified by the use of blockchain technology to provide a secure digital [[ledger]] to track financial interactions across the internet, hardened against forgery by [[trusted timestamp]]ing and dissemination of a [[distributed database]].&lt;ref name=Vigna20150127/&gt;{{rp|229}}&lt;ref name=Hodson20131120/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wright2015/&gt; This approach eliminates the need to involve a mutually acceptable [[trusted third party]] in a financial transaction, thus simplifying the transaction.&lt;ref name=Hodson20131120/&gt; The costs of a blockchain-enabled transaction and of the associated data reporting may be substantially offset by the elimination of both the trusted third party and of the need for repetitive recording of contract exchanges in different records. For example, the blockchain data could, in principle and if regulatory structures permit it, replace public documents such as [[deed]]s and [[Title (property)|title]]s.&lt;ref name=Vigna20150127/&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;ref name=Hodson20131120/&gt; In theory, a blockchain approach allows multiple [[cloud computing]] users to enter a loosely coupled [[peer-to-peer]] [[smart contract]] collaboration.&lt;ref name=Vigna20150127/&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;ref name=Norta2015/&gt;

[[Daniel Larimer]] first proposed the concept of a "Decentralized Organized Company" in an article published on September 7, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://letstalkbitcoin.com/is-bitcoin-overpaying-for-false-security|title=Over Paying for Security|work=Let's Talk Bitcoin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented in Bitshares in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.is/WpMpu|title=What Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization? - NullTX|date=2018-11-09|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Vitalik Buterin]] proposed that after a DAO was launched, it might be organized to run without human managerial interactivity, provided the [[smart contract]]s were supported by a [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]] platform.&lt;ref name=Buterin201309/&gt; [[Ethereum]], built on a blockchain and launched in 2015, has been described as meeting that Turing threshold, thus enabling such DAOs.&lt;ref name=Vigna20150127/&gt;{{rp|229}}&lt;ref name=Pangburn2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evans2015/&gt; Decentralized autonomous organizations aim to be open platforms where individuals control their identities and their personal data.&lt;ref name=Deegan2014/&gt;

== Issues ==
It can be difficult for a DAO to retain an attorney, or enter any kind of written contract because nobody in the company is interested in putting their personal name on agreements.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Social===
Shareholder participation in DAOs can be problematic. For example, ''BitShares'' has seen a lack of voting participation, because it takes time and energy to consider proposals.&lt;ref name=Economist20160521/&gt;

=== Legal liability ===
The precise legal status of this type of business organization is unclear;&lt;ref name=Wright2015/&gt;  some similar approaches have been regarded by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] as illegal offers of unregistered [[Security (finance)|securities]].&lt;ref name=Popper20160521/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEC20140603/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hinkes20160519/&gt; Although unclear, a DAO may functionally be a corporation without legal status as a corporation: a [[general partnership]].&lt;ref name=Levine20160517/&gt; This means potentially [[limited liability|unlimited legal liability]] for participants, even if the smart contract code or the DAO's promoters say otherwise.&lt;ref name=Levine20160517/&gt; Known participants, or those at the interface between a DAO and regulated financial systems, may be targets for regulatory enforcement or civil actions.&lt;ref name=Levine20160517/&gt;&lt;!--=== Regulation and enforcement === probably should add something about state/less etc--&gt;

=== Security ===
The code of a given DAO will be difficult to alter once the system is up and running, including bug fixes that would be otherwise trivial in centralised code. Corrections for a DAO would require writing new code and agreement to migrate all the funds. Although the code is visible to all, it is hard to repair, thus leaving known security holes open to exploitation unless a moratorium is called to enable bug fixing.&lt;ref name=Peck20160528/&gt;

In 2016, a specific DAO, "[[The DAO (organization)|The DAO]]", set a record for the largest [[crowdfunding]] campaign to date.&lt;ref name=Castillo20160512/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vigna20160516/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waters20160517/&gt; Researchers pointed out multiple issues in the code of The DAO. The operational procedure for The DAO allowed investors to withdraw at will any money that had not yet been committed to a project; the funds could thus deplete quickly.&lt;ref name=Economist20160521/&gt; Although safeguards aimed to prevent gaming the voting of shareholders to win investments,&lt;ref name=Popper20160521/&gt; there were a "number of security vulnerabilities".&lt;ref name=Popper20160527/&gt; These enabled an attempted large withdrawal of funds from The DAO to be initiated in mid-June 2016.&lt;ref name=Popper20160617/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price20160617/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cimpanu20160618/&gt; On the 20th of July 2016, the [[Ethereum]] community arrived at a consensus decision to hard fork the Ethereum blockchain to [[bailout|bail out]] the original contract.&lt;ref name="daobail"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Vitalik Buterin |authorlink1=Vitalik Buterin |title=Hard Fork Completed |url=https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/20/hard-fork-completed |website=blog.ethereum.org |publisher=Ehereum Foundation |accessdate=27 September 2018 |language=en |date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Discoverability''' is the degree to which of something, especially a piece of content or information, can be found in a search of a file, database, or other information system. Discoverability is a concern in [[library and information science]], many aspects of digital media, software and web development, and in marketing, since something (e.g., a website, product, service, etc.) cannot be used if people cannot find it or do not understand what it can be used for. [[Metadata]], or "information about information," such as a book's title, a product's description, or a website's keywords, affects how discoverable something is on a database or online. In the 2010s, adding metadata to a product that is available online can make it easier for [[end user]]s to find the product. For example, if a song file is made available online, making the title, name of the band, genre, year of release, and other pertinent information available in connection with this song file will make it easier for users to find this song file. Organizing information by putting it into alphabetical order or including it in a search engine is an example of how to improve discoverability. Discoverability is related to, but different from, [[accessibility]] and [[usability]], other qualities that affect the usefulness of a piece of information.
==Etymology==
The concept of "discoverability" in an information science and online context is a loose borrowing from the concept of the similar name in the legal profession. In law, "discovery" is a pre-trial procedure in a [[lawsuit]] in which each party, through the law of [[civil procedure]], can obtain evidence from the other party or parties by means of discovery devices such as a request for answers to [[interrogatories]], [[Request for production|request for production of document]]s, request for admissions and [[Deposition (law)|deposition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Conducting Discovery in a Civil Lawsuit|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/civil-litigation/conducting-discovery-civil-lawsuit|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=30 September 2017|date=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discovery can be obtained from non-parties using [[subpoena]]s.  When a discovery request is objected to, the requesting party may seek the assistance of the court by filing a [[motion to compel]] discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwarzner|first1=William W.|title=The Federal Rules, the Adversary Process, and Discovery Reform|journal=University of Pittsburgh Law Review|date=1988|volume=50|page=703|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/upitt50&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The usability of any piece of information directly relates to how discoverable it is, either in a "[[walled garden (technology)|walled garden]]" database or on the open Internet. The quality of information available on this database or on the Internet depends upon the quality of the meta-information about each item, product, or service. In the case of a service, because of the emphasis placed on service reusability, opportunities should exist for reuse of this service. However, reuse  is only possible if information is discoverable in the first place. To make items, products, and services discoverable, the following set of activities need to be performed:

# Document the information about the item, product or service (the metadata) in a consistent manner.
# Store the documented information (metadata) in a searchable repository.
# Enable yourself and others to search for the documented information in an efficient manner.

Regarding number 2, storing the information in a searchable repository: while technically a human-searchable repository, such as a printed paper list would qualify, in the 2010s, "searchable repository" is usually taken to mean a computer-searchable repository, such as a [[database]] that a human user can search using some type of [[search engine]] or "find" feature. Number 3 further supports this analysis of number 2, because while reading through a printed paper list by hand might be feasible in a theoretical sense, it is not time and cost-efficient in comparison with computer-based searching.

Apart from increasing the reuse potential of the services, discoverability is also required to avoid development of solution logic that is already contained in an existing service. To design services that are not only discoverable but also provide interpretable information about their capabilities, the service discoverability principle provides guidelines that could be applied during the [[Service-oriented modeling|service-oriented analysis]] phase of the service delivery process.

===Specific to digital media===
In relation to audiovisual content, according to the meaning given by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) for the purpose of its 2016 Discoverability Summit, discoverability can be summed up to the intrinsic ability of given content to "stand out of the lot", or to position itself so as to be easily found and discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discoverability Summit|url=http://www.discoverability.ca|website=Discoverability Summit|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A piece of audiovisual content can be a movie, a TV series, music, a book ([[eBook]]), an audio book or podcast. When audiovisual content such as a digital file for a TV show, movie, or song, is made available online, if the content is "tagged" with identifying information such as the names of the key artists (e.g., actors, directors and screenwriters for TV shows and movies; singers, musicians and record producers for songs) and the genres (e.g., for movies genres such as action, drama or comedy; for songs, genres such as heavy metal music, hip hop music, etc.), this makes it easier for end users to find the content they are interested in.

In the 2010s, when users interact with online content, [[algorithm]]s typically determine what types of content the user is interested in, and then a computer program suggests "more like this", which is other content that the user may be interested in. Different websites and systems have different algorithms, but one approach, used by Amazon for its online store, is to indicate to a user, once the user searches for or looks at content/product ''x'' that "other users who purchased ''x'' also purchased the following items". This example is oriented around online purchasing behaviour, but an algorithm could also be programmed to provide suggestions based on other factors (e.g., searching, viewing, etc.). 

In the 2010s, discoverability is typically referred to in connection with [[search engine]]s. A highly "discoverable" piece of content (e.g., a certain movie) would be a movie that appears at the top, or near the top of a user's search results. A related concept is the role of "recommendation engines", which are computer programs which give a user recommendations based on his/her online activity. In the 2010s, "discoverabilty" applies to desktop and laptop computers and do the increasingly widening range of devices that can access the Internet, including various [[console video game]] systems and mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. When organizations make an effort to promote certain content (e.g., a TV show, film, song, or video game), they can use "traditional marketing" (billboards, TV ads, radio ads) and digital ads (pop-up ads, pre-roll ads, etc.), or a mix of traditional and digital marketing.

Even before the user’s intervention by searching for a certain content or type of content, discoverability is the prime factor which contributes to whether a piece of audiovisual content will be likely to be found in the various digital modes of content consumption. As of 2017, modes of searching include looking on [[Netflix]] for movies, [[Spotify]] for music, Audible for audio books, etc., although the concept can also more generally be applied to content found on [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Instagram]] and other websites. It involves more than a content’s mere presence on a given platform; it can involve associating this content with "keywords" (tags), search algorithms, positioning within different categories, metadata, etc. Thus, discoverability enables as much as it promotes. For audiovisual content broadcast or streamed on digital media using the Internet, discoverability includes the underlying concepts of information science and programming architecture, which are at the very foundation of the search for a specific product, information or content.

==Applications==

===Within a webpage===
Within a specific webpage or software application ("app"), the discoverability of a feature, content or link depends on a range of factors, including the size, colour, highlighting features, and position within the page. When colour is used to communicate the importance of a feature or link, designers typically use other elements as well, such as shadows or bolding, for individuals who cannot see certain colours. Just as traditional paper printing created other physical locations that stood out, such as being "above the fold" of a newspaper versus "below the fold", a web page or app's screenview may have certain locations that give features additional visibility to users, such as being right at the bottom of the web page or screen. 

The positional advantages or disadvantages of various locations depend on different cultures and languages (e.g., left to right vs. right to left). Some locations have become established, such as having toolbars at the top of a screen or webpage. Some designers have argued that commonly used features (e.g., a print button) should be much more visually prominent than very rarely used features. Some features cannot be seen, but there is a convention that if the user places the mouse cursor in a certain area, then a toolbar or function option will become visible. In general, because of the smaller screen of mobile devices, controls are often not placed right in the centre of the screen, because that is where the user views content or text.

Some organizations try to increase the discoverability of a certain feature by adding animation, such as a moving "click here" icon. As of 2017, the addition of motion sensors and geotracking to mobile devices has made webpage design for discoverability more complex, because smartphones and tablets are typically capable of having many more inputs from the user than a 1980s era desktop, including "swiping" the [[touchscreen]], touching images on the screen, or tilting the device. One of the challenges in webpage and app design is that the degree of sophistication and experience of users with navigating in the webpage or app environment varies a great deal, from individuals who are new to using these applications at one extreme to experienced computer users.

===Internet search===
For items that are searched for online, the goal of discoverability is to be at or near the top of the search results. Organizations may make efforts to make it more likely that "their" content or webpages are at the top, or close to the top, of search results; these approaches are often collectively called [[search engine optimization]] (SEO). Note that when an organization takes action to increase the SEO of its website, this does not normally involve changes to the search engine itself; rather, it involves adding metadata tags and original content, among other strategies, to increase the "visibility" of the website to search engine algorithms.

====Services====
In a service delivery context, the application of this principle requires collecting information about the service during the service analysis phase as during this phase; maximum information is available about the service’s functional context&lt;ref name="FuncContext"&gt;The overall purpose of the service&lt;/ref&gt; and the capabilities of the service. At this stage, the domain knowledge of the business experts could also be enlisted to document meta-data about the service. In the [[Service-oriented modeling|service-oriented design]] phase, the already gathered meta-data could be made part of the service contract.&lt;ref name='servicecontract'&gt;[http://www.whatissoa.com/p11.php Service Contract]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[OASIS SOA Reference Model|OASIS SOA-RM]] standard specifies ''service description'' as an artifact that represents service meta-data.&lt;ref name='Michael Poulin'&gt;Michael Poulin. [http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/service_oriented/2009/02/evolution_of_principles_of_service_orientation_service_composability_and_discoverability_part_7.php Evolution of principles of Service Orientation: Service Composability and Discoverability, part 7]. Date accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

To make the service meta-data accessible to interested parties, it must be centrally accessible.

==Metadata types==

===Functional===
This is the basic type of meta-information that expresses the functional context of the service and the details about the product, content, or service’s capabilities. The application of the [[standardized service contract]] principle helps to create the basic functional meta-data in a consistent manner. The same standardization should be applied when the same meta-information is being outside the technical contract&lt;ref name='technicalcontract'&gt;[http://www.whatissoa.com/p11.php technical contract]&lt;/ref&gt; of the service e.g. when publishing information to a service registry.&lt;ref name="SvcRegistry"&gt;A repository that contains meta-data about services in a specific format e.g. classification of service, its location, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

For general items, the data that might be used to categorize them may include:
* Name of product, content or service (for audiovisual content, this would be song name, or TV show/movie title)
* Name of manufacturer, designer, creators (for audiovisual content, this would be names of director/producer/artists)
* Technical data (size, weight, height for physical items, or in the case of digital files, compression approach, file size)
* For items which can identify their location via embedded sensors (such as with [[Internet of things]] [[geolocation]] data), location of use/access)

===Quality of service===
For services, to know about the service behavior and its limitations,&lt;ref name='Jim Murphy'&gt;Jim Murphy. [http://www.soamag.com/I5/0307-2.php Essential Components of an SOA Quality Foundation]. Date accessed: 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and about the user's service experience, all of this information needs to be documented within the service registry. This way potential consumers can use this meta-information by comparing it against their performance requirements.

==Considerations==
===Services===
The effective application of this design principle requires that the meta-information recorded against each service needs to be consistent and meaningful. This is only possible if organization-wide standards exist that enforce service developers to record the required meta-data in a consistent way. The information recorded as the meta-data for the service needs to be presented in a way so that both technical and non-technical IT experts can understand the purpose and the capabilities of the service, as an evaluation of the service may be required by the business people before the service is authorized to be used.

This principle is best applied during the service-oriented analysis phase as during this time, all the details about the service’s purpose and functionality are available. Although most of the service design principles support each other in a positive manner, however, in case of [[service abstraction]] and service discoverability principle, there exists an inversely proportional relationship. This is because as more and more details about the service are hidden away from the service consumers, less discoverable information is available for discovering the service. This could be addressed by carefully recording the service meta-information so that the inner workings of the service are not documented within this meta-information.
===Algorithms===
In the online economy, sophisticated computer programs called algorithms analyse the ways that end users search for, access and use different content or products online. Thus, not only is metadata created regarding the content or product (e.g., the author and genre of an e-book), but also data is generated about specific human users' interaction with this content. If an organization such as a [[social media]] website has a user profile for a given person, indicating demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location of residence, employment status, education, etc.), then this social media website can collect and analyse information about tendencies of a given user or a given subcategory of users. When social media websites are collecting data about human users' online activities and preferences, this may raise potential privacy concerns. 

Algorithms have been called “[[black box]]es”, because the factors used by the leading  websites in their algorithms are typically proprietary information which is not released to the public. While a number of [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) firms offer the services of attempting to increase the ranking of a client’s web content or website, these SEO firms do not typically know the exact algorithms used by Google and Facebook. Ghosh et al found that algorithm "[[web crawler]]"s can only access 26% of new online content "...by recrawling a constant fraction of the entire web". &lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Anirban; Ghosh, Arpita; Kumar, Ravi; Olston, Christopher; Pandey, Sandeep; and Tomkins, Andrew. ''The Discoverability of the Web''. http://www.arpitaghosh.com/papers/discoverability.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, one concern raised with the increasing role of algorithms on search engines and databases, is that once a specific person indicates a preference for a certain type of content or product, the computer algorithm may increasingly focus on making recommendations in this type of content. To give a practical example, if a person searches for comedy movies online, a search engine algorithm may start mainly recommending comedies to this user, and not showing him or her the range of other films (e.g., drama, documentary, etc.). On the positive side, if this person only likes comedy films, then this restricted "filter" will reduce the information load of scanning through vast numbers of films. However, various cultural stakeholders have raised concerns about how these filter algorithms may restrict the diversity of material that is discoverable to users. Concerns about the dangers of "filter bubbles" have been raised in regards to online news services, which provide types of news, news sources, or topics to a user based on his/her previous online activities. Thus a person who has previously searched for Fox TV content will mainly be shown more Fox TV content and a person who has previously searched for PBS content will be shown more PBS search results, and so on. This could lead to news readers becoming only aware of a certain news source's viewpoints.

The search behaviour of video content viewers has changed a great deal since the widespread popularity of video sharing websites and video streaming. Whereas a typical TV show consumer of the 1980s would read a print edition of ''[[TV Guide]]'' to find out what shows were on, or click from channel to channel ("channel surfing") to see if any shows appealed to them, in the 2010s, video content consumers are increasingly watching on screens (either [[smart TV]]s, [[tablet computer]] screens or [[smartphone]]s) that have a computerized search function and often automated algorithm-created suggestions for the viewer. With this search function, a user can enter the name of a TV show, producer, actor, screenwriter or genre to help them find content of interest to them. If the user is searching on a search engine on a device (laptop, tablet computer, smartphone) they own, the device may transmit information about the user's preferences and previous online searches to the website. Continuing with this 1980s to 2010s comparison, in the 1980s, the type or brand of television a user was watching on did not affect his/her viewing habits. However, a person searching for TV shows in the 2010s on different brands of computerized [[smart TV]]s will probably get different search results for the same search term.

===Limitations===
For organizations that are trying to get maximal user uptake of their product, content or service online, discoverability has become an important goal. However, achieving discovery does not automatically translate into market success. For example, if the hypothetical online game "xyz" is easily discoverable, but it will not function on most mobile devices, then this video game will not perform well in the mobile game market, despite it being at the top of search results. As well, even if the product functions, that is it runs or plays properly, as well, users may not like the product. 

In the case that a user does like a certain online product or service, the discoverability has to be repeatable. If the user cannot find the product or service on a subsequent search, she or he may no longer look for this product/service, and instead shift to a substitute that is easily and reliably findable. It is not enough to make the online product or service discoverable for only a short period, unless the goal is only to create “viral” content as part of a short-term marketing campaign.

Designed by [[Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon]] and completed in 1931, the building has a roof height of {{convert|1,250|ft|m}} and stands a total of {{convert|1454|ft|m|1}} tall, including its [[antenna tower|antenna]]. Its name is derived from "[[Empire State]]", the [[List of U.S. state nicknames|nickname]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], which is of unknown origin. {{As of|2017}} the building is the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|5th-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States]] and the [[List of tallest buildings|28th-tallest in the world]]. It is also the [[List of tallest freestanding structures|6th-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas]].

The site of the Empire State Building, located on the west side of [[Fifth Avenue]] between West [[33rd Street (Manhattan)|33rd]] and [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Streets]], was originally part of an early 18th century farm. In the late 1820s, it came into the possession of the prominent [[Astor family]], with [[John Jacob Astor|John Jacob Astor's]] descendants building the [[Waldorf–Astoria (New York, 1893)|Waldorf–Astoria Hotel]] on the site in the 1890s. The hotel remained in operation until the late 1920s, when it was sold to the Bethlehem Engineering Corporation in 1928 for an estimated $20m. Following this sale, the property changed hands once more, coming under the ownership of Empire State Inc., a business venture that included famous businessman and former General Motors executive, [[John J. Raskob]], members of the du Pont family, and former New York governor [[Al Smith]], who was tasked with heading the corporation.&lt;ref name="ChicagoTribune-Factbox"/&gt; The original design of the Empire State Building was for a 50-story office building. However, after fifteen revisions, the final design was for a 86-story 1,250-foot building, with an [[airship]] mast on top. This ensured it would be the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world|world's tallest building]], beating the [[Chrysler Building]] and [[40 Wall Street]], two other Manhattan skyscrapers under construction at the time that were also vying for that distinction.

Demolition of the Waldorf–Astoria began in October 1929, and the foundation of the Empire State Building was excavated before demolition was even complete. Construction on the building itself started on March 17, 1930, with an average construction rate of four and a half floors per week. A well-coordinated schedule meant that the 86 stories were [[topping out|topped out]] on September 19, six months after construction started, and the mast was completed by November 21. From that point, interior work proceeded at a quick pace, and it was opened on May 1, 1931, thirteen and a half months after the first steel beam was erected. In a ceremony held in Washington D.C., President Herbert Hoover officially opened the Empire State Building to the public, remotely pressing a button that illuminated the building’s iconic lights. Despite the publicity surrounding the building's construction, its owners failed to make a profit until the early 1950s. However, since its opening, the building's Art Deco architecture and open-air observation deck has made it a popular tourist attraction, with around 4 million visitors from around the world visiting the building's 86th and 102nd floor observatories every year.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Since the mid-2010s, the Empire State Building has been undergoing improvements to improve access to its observation decks.&lt;ref name="AMNY-NewLobby-2018"/&gt;

The Empire State Building stood as the world's tallest building for nearly 40 years until the completion of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]'s [[One World Trade Center#Original building|North Tower]] in [[Lower Manhattan]] in late 1970. Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, it was again the tallest building in New York until the new [[One World Trade Center]] was completed in April 2012.

The Empire State Building is an [[United States|American]] [[cultural icon]] and has been featured in more than 250 TV shows and movies since the film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' was released in 1933. A symbol of New York City, the tower has been named as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Modern World]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. The Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior have been designated as a city landmark by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]], and were confirmed as such by the [[New York City Board of Estimate]]. It was also designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986, and was ranked number one on the [[American Institute of Architects]]' List of [[America's Favorite Architecture]] in 2007.

===Planning process{{anchor|Plans}}===
Bethlehem Engineering Corporation originally intended to build a 25-story office building on the Waldorf–Astoria site. The company's president, Floyd De L. Brown, paid $100,000 of the $1 million [[down payment]] required to start construction on the tower, with the promise that the difference would be paid later.{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=108}} Brown borrowed $900,000 from a bank, but then [[Default (finance)|defaulted]] on the loan.{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=109}}{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|pp=85–87}}

[[File:Empire State Building by David Shankbone crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The building plans went through fifteen versions before the current plan was approved.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=81}}]]

The land was then resold to Empire State Inc., a group of wealthy investors that included [[Louis G. Kaufman]], [[Ellis P. Earle]], [[John J.

Empire State Inc. contracted [[William F. Lamb]], of architectural firm [[Shreve, Lamb and Harmon]], to create the building design.{{sfn|Jackson|2010|p=413}}{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=89}} Lamb produced the building drawings in just two weeks using the firm's earlier designs for the [[Reynolds Building]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] as the basis.{{sfn|Al-Kodmany|2017|p=72}} Concurrently, Lamb's partner [[Richmond Shreve]] created "bug diagrams" of the project requirements.{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|pp=246–247}} The [[1916 Zoning Resolution|1916 Zoning Act]] forced Lamb to design a structure that incorporated [[setback (architecture)|setbacks]] resulting in the lower floors being larger than the upper floors. Consequently, the tower was designed from the top down,{{sfn|Wagner|2003|p=12}} giving it a "pencil"-like shape.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=157}}

The original plan of the building was 50 stories,{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=81}} but was later increased to 60 and then 80 stories.&lt;ref name=nyt19290805/&gt; Height restrictions were placed on nearby buildings&lt;ref name=nyt19290805/&gt; to ensure that the top fifty floors of the planned 80-story, {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} building{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|p=14}}{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=129}} would have unobstructed views of the city.&lt;ref name=nyt19290805/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' lauded the site's proximity to transportation, with the [[Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation|Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit's]] [[34th Street–Herald Square (BMT Broadway Line)|34th Street]] station and the [[PATH (rail system)|Hudson and Manhattan Railroad's]] [[33rd Street station (PATH)|33rd Street]] terminal one block away, as well as [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Penn Station]] two blocks away and the [[Grand Central Terminal]] nine blocks away at its closest.

While plans for the Empire State Building were being finalized, an intense competition in New York for the title of "[[List of tallest buildings in the world|world's tallest building]]" was underway. [[40 Wall Street]] (then the Bank of Manhattan Building) and the [[Chrysler Building]] in Manhattan both vied for this distinction and were already under construction when work began on the Empire State Building.{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|p=14}} The "Race into the Sky", as popular media called it at the time, was representative of the country's optimism in the 1920s, fueled by the building boom in major cities.{{sfn|Rasenberger|2009|pp=388–389}} The 40 Wall Street tower was revised, in April 1929, from {{convert|840|ft|m}} to {{convert|925|ft|m}} making it the world's tallest.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=130}} The Chrysler Building added its {{convert|185|ft|m|adj=on}} steel tip to its roof in October 1929, thus bringing it to a height of {{convert|1046|ft|m}} and greatly exceeding the height of 40 Wall Street.{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|p=14}} The Chrysler Building's developer, [[Walter Chrysler]], realized that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having instructed his architect, [[William Van Alen]], to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] dome to a narrow steel spire.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=130}} Raskob, wishing to have the Empire State Building be the world's tallest, reviewed the plans and had five floors added as well as a spire; however, the new floors would need to be set back because of projected wind pressure on the extension.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=131}} On November 18, 1929, Smith acquired a lot at 27–31 West 33rd Street, adding {{convert|75|ft|m}} to the width of the proposed office building's site.{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=230}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=ENLARGES SITE FOR 1,000-FOOT BUILDING; Empire State Adds 75 Feet in 33d Street to the Waldorf Hotel Plot. | work=The New York Times | date=November 19, 1929 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/11/19/107107719.pdf | access-date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Smith announced the updated plans for the skyscraper that included an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of {{convert|1050|ft|m}}, higher than the Chrysler's 71st-floor observation deck.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=131}}

Demolition of the old Waldorf–Astoria began on October 1, 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/10/02/94184775.pdf|title=RAZING OF WALDORF STARTED BY SMITH; Ceremony on Roof Marks the Beginning of Demolition of Historic Hotel.

Furthermore, the old hotel's granite, wood chips, and "'precious' metals such as lead, brass, and zinc" were not in high demand resulting in issues with disposal.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|pp=198–199}} Most of the wood was deposited into a woodpile on nearby 30th Street or was burned in a swamp elsewhere.

In addition to the time constraint builders had, there were also space limitations because construction materials had to be delivered quickly, and trucks needed to drop off these materials without congesting traffic. This was solved by creating a temporary driveway for the trucks between 33rd and 34th Streets, and then storing the materials in the building's first floor and basements. [[Concrete mixer]]s, brick hoppers, and stone hoists inside the building ensured that materials would be able to ascend quickly and without endangering or inconveniencing the public.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=214}} At one point, over 200 trucks made material deliveries at the building site every day.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=86}} A series of relay and erection [[derrick]]s, placed on platforms erected near the building, lifted the steel from the trucks below and installed the beams at the appropriate locations.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=208}} The Empire State Building was structurally completed on April 11, 1931, twelve days ahead of schedule and 410&amp;nbsp;days after construction commenced.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=86}} Al Smith shot the final rivet, which was made of solid gold.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|pp=213–214}}

The modernistic, [[stainless steel]] canopies of the entrances on 33rd and 34th Streets lead to two-story-high corridors around the elevator core, crossed by stainless steel and glass-enclosed bridges at the second-floor level.&lt;ref name="AIA" /&gt; The [[rivet]]ed steel frame of the building was originally designed to handle all of the building's gravitational stresses and [[wind load]]s.{{sfn|Taranath|2016|p=459}} The exterior of the building is clad in [[Indiana limestone]] panels sourced from the Empire Mill in [[Sanders, Indiana]],&lt;ref name="PetersonNYT1981"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/10/us/limestone-center-turns-to-tourism.html|title=LIMESTONE CENTER TURNS TO TOURISM|last1=Peterson|first1=Iver|date=November 10, 1981|website=The New York Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524081323/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/10/us/limestone-center-turns-to-tourism.html|archivedate=May 24, 2015|accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which give the building its signature blonde color.{{sfn|Al-Kodmany|2017|p=72}} The limestone facade, which is lined with vertical steel [[mullion]]s parallel to each window,{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=81}} also helps to increase the stiffness of the steel frame against high winds.{{sfn|Taranath|2016|p=459}} The amount of material used in the building's construction resulted in a very stiff structure when compared to other skyscrapers, with a structural stiffness of {{convert|42|psf}} versus the [[Willis Tower]]'s {{convert|33|psf}} and the [[John Hancock Center]]'s {{convert|26|psf}}.{{sfn|Taranath|2016|p=527}} A December 1930 feature in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' estimated that a building with the Empire State's dimensions would still stand even if hit with an impact of {{convert|50|ST|LT}}.{{sfn|Popular Mechanics|December 1930|p=920}}

The Empire State Building design featured one major [[Setback (architecture)|setback]] and several smaller ones that reduce the level dimensions as the height increases, thus making upper 81 floors much smaller than the lower five floors. However, this design allows sunlight to illuminate the interiors of the top floors and, in addition, positions these floors away from the noisy streets below.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=157}}{{sfn|Kayden|Municipal Art Society|2000|pp=8–9}} This design was mandated as per the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]], which was intended to allow sunlight to reach the streets as well.{{Efn|name=zoning|As per the 1916 Zoning Act, the wall of any given tower that faces a street could only rise to a certain height, proportionate to the street's width, at which point the building had to be set back by a given proportion. This system of setbacks would continue until the tower reaches a floor level in which that level's floor area was 25% that of the ground level's area. After that 25% threshold was reached, the building could rise without restriction.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=81}}{{sfn|Kayden|Municipal Art Society|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Willis|1995|p=67}} This law was modified in 1961.{{sfn|Kayden|Municipal Art Society|2000|pp=11–12}}}} Normally, a building of the Empire State's dimensions would be permitted to build up to 12 stories on the Fifth Avenue side, and up to 17 stories on the 33rd/34th Streets side, before it would have to utilize setbacks.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Novel-Design-1930"/&gt; However, the setbacks were arranged such that the largest setback was on the sixth floor, above the five-floor "base",&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Novel-Design-1930"&gt;{{cite news | title=SMITH SKYSCRAPER HAS A NOVEL DESIGN; Setbacks of the Empire State Building Will Begin With the Sixth Story.

===Interior===
The Empire State Building was the first building to have more than 100 floors.{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|p=56}} It has 6,500 windows; 73 elevators;&lt;ref name="Navarro 2009"/&gt; a total floor area of {{convert|2768591|sqft|m2|0|abbr=on}}; and a base covering {{convert|2|acre|m2|0|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=183}} Its original 64 elevators, built by the [[Otis Elevator Company]],{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=183}} are located in a central core and are of varying heights, with the longest of these elevators reaching from the lobby to the 80th floor.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Novel-Design-1930"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bonnier193104&gt;{{cite book |author=Bonnier Corporation |title=Popular Science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8ycDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 |date=April 1931 |publisher=Bonnier Corporation |isbn= |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; As originally built, there were four "express" elevators that connected the lobby, 80th floor, and several landings in between; the other 60 "local" elevators connected the landings with the floors above these intermediate landings.{{sfn|Willis|1995|p=96}} Of the 64 total elevators, 58 were for passenger use (comprising the four express elevators and 54 local elevators), and eight were for freight deliveries.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=81}} The elevators were designed to move at {{convert|1200|ft/min|0}}.

====Lobby====
[[File:Empire State Building in Manhattan, New York, USA (9892744176).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aluminum relief of the building]]

The original main lobby is accessed from Fifth Avenue, on the building's east side, and contains an entrance with one set of [[double door]]s between a pair of [[revolving door]]s. At the top of each doorway is a bronze motif depicting one of three "crafts or industries" used in the building's construction—Electricity, Masonry, and Heating.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=13}} The lobby contains two tiers of marble, a lighter marble on the top, above the storefronts, and a darker marble on the bottom, flush with the storefronts. There is a pattern of zigzagging [[terrazzo]] tiles on the lobby floor, which leads from the entrance on the east to the aluminum relief on the west.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=15}} The chapel-like three-story-high lobby, which runs parallel to 33rd and 34th Streets, contains storefronts on both its northern and southern sides.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|pages=12–13}} These storefronts are framed on each side by tubes of dark "modernistically rounded marble", according to the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]], and above by a vertical band of grooves set into the marble.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=15}} Immediately inside the lobby is an airport-style security checkpoint.{{sfn|Fodor's|2010|p=153}}

The walls on both the northern and southern sides of the lobby house storefronts and escalators to a mezzanine level.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=15}}{{Efn|name=layout-lobby}} At the west end of the lobby is an aluminum relief of the skyscraper as it was originally built (i.e. without the antenna).&lt;ref name=Lepik2008&gt;{{cite book | last=Lepik | first=Andres | title=Skyscrapers | publisher=Prestel | year=2008 | isbn=978-3-7913-3992-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VJJAQAAIAAJ | pages=53–54 | access-date=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relief, which was intended to provide a welcoming effect,{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=1}} contains an embossing of the building's outline, accompanied by what the Landmarks Preservation Commission describes as "the rays of an aluminum sun shining out behind [the tower] and mingling with aluminum rays emanating from the spire of the Empire State Building". In the background is a state map of New York with the building's location marked by a "medallion" in the very southeast portion of the outline. A compass is located in the bottom right and a plaque to the tower's major developers is on the bottom left.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=14}}

The plaque at the western end of the lobby is located on the eastern interior wall of a one-story tall rectangular-shaped corridor that surrounds the banks of escalators, with a similar design to the lobby.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|pages=12, 15}} The rectangular shaped corridor actually consists of two long hallways on the northern and southern sides of the rectangle,{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=12}} as well as a shorter hallway on the eastern side and another long hallway on the western side.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|pages=12, 15}} At both ends of the northern and southern corridors, there is a bank of four low-rise elevators in between the corridors.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=16}} The western side of the rectangular elevator-bank corridor extends north to the 34th Street entrance and south to the 33rd Street entrance. It borders three large storefronts and leads to escalators that go both to the second floor and to the basement. Going from west to east, there are secondary entrances to 34th and 33rd Streets from both the northern and southern corridors, respectively, at approximately the two-thirds point of each corridor.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=15}}{{Efn|name=layout-lobby|See {{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981}}, PDF page 26, for a diagram of the lobby.}}

Until the 1960s, an art deco mural, inspired by both the sky and the [[Machine Age]], was installed in the lobby ceilings.&lt;ref name=Lepik2008/&gt; Subsequent damage to these murals, designed by artist Leif Neandross, resulted in reproductions being installed. Renovations to the lobby in 2009, such as replacing the clock over the information desk in the Fifth Avenue lobby with an [[anemometer]] and installing two chandeliers intended to be part of the building when it originally opened, revived much of its original grandeur.&lt;ref name=nyt20090923&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/nyregion/23empire.html |title=Overhead, a Lobby Is Restored to Old Glory |work=The New York Times |author=Barron, James |authorlink=James Barron (journalist) |date=September 22, 2009 |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306125255/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/nyregion/23empire.html |archivedate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The north corridor contained eight illuminated panels created in 1963 by Roy Sparkia and Renée Nemorov, in time for the [[1964 World's Fair]], depicting the building as the [[Eighth Wonder of the World]] alongside the traditional seven.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=16}}&lt;ref name=arbus-bio&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CveczaI95Q8C&amp;pg=PA215|title=Diane Arbus: A Biography|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|date=1984|publisher=W.

====Broadcast stations====
[[File:Empirestatebuilding29122005.JPG|thumb|left|Antennae for broadcast stations are located at the top of the Building.]]

Broadcasting began at the Empire State Building on December 22, 1931, when [[NBC]] and [[RCA]] began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the spire, with two separate transmitters for the visual and audio data. They leased the 85th floor and built a laboratory there.&lt;ref name=be196708/&gt; In 1934, RCA was joined by [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] in a cooperative venture to test his FM system from the building's antenna.&lt;ref name=ZarkinZarkin2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lessing 1956 p. 20"&gt;{{cite book | last=Lessing | first=L. | title=Man of High Fidelity: Edwin Howard Armstrong: A Biography | publisher=Lippincott | year=1956 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYAeAAAAIAAJ | access-date=October 23, 2017 | page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This setup, which entailed the installation of the world's first [[Frequency modulation|FM transmitter]],&lt;ref name="Lessing 1956 p. 20"/&gt; continued only until October of the next year due to disputes between RCA and Armstrong.&lt;ref name=be196708/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZarkinZarkin2006&gt;{{cite book | last=Zarkin | first=K. | last2=Zarkin | first2=M.J. | title=The Federal Communications Commission: Front Line in the Culture and Regulation Wars | publisher=Greenwood Press | series=Understanding our government | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-313-33416-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZ33mq1mLmAC&amp;pg=PA109 | access-date=October 23, 2017 | pages=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, NBC wanted to install more TV equipment in the room where Armstrong's transmitter was located.&lt;ref name="Lessing 1956 p. 20"/&gt;

After some time, the 85th floor became home to RCA's New York television operations initially as experimental station W2XBS channel 1 then, from 1941, as commercial station WNBT channel 1 (now [[WNBC-TV]] channel 4).

[[File:Empire State Building from the Top of the Rock.jpg|thumb|alt=The Empire State Building as seen from the Top of the Rock|Seen from the [[Top of the Rock]]]]

The placement of the stations in the Empire State Building became a major issue with the construction of the World Trade Center Twin Towers in the late 1960s, and early 1970s. The greater height of the Twin Towers would reflect radio waves broadcast from the Empire State Building, eventually resulting in some broadcasters relocating to the newer towers instead of suing the developer, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]].{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=356}} Even though the nine stations who were broadcasting from the Empire State Building were leasing their broadcast space until 1984, most of these stations moved to the World Trade Center as soon as it was completed in 1971. The broadcasters obtained a court order stipulating that the Port Authority had to build a mast and transmission equipment in the [[One World Trade Center#Original building|North Tower]], as well as pay the broadcasters' leases in the Empire State Building until 1984.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|pp=356–357}} Only a few broadcasters renewed their leases in the Empire State Building.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=357}}

The [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 destroyed the World Trade Center and the broadcast centers atop it, leaving most of the city's stations without a station for ten days until a temporary tower was built in [[Alpine, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Guerrero et al.|2002|p=36}} By October 2001, nearly all of the city's commercial broadcast stations (both television and FM radio) were again transmitting from the top of the Empire State Building. In a report that [[United States Congress|Congress]] commissioned about the transition from [[analog television]] to [[digital television]], it was stated that the placement of broadcast stations in the Empire State Building was considered "problematic" due to interference from other nearby towers. In comparison, the Congressional report stated that the former Twin Towers had very few buildings of comparable height nearby thus signals suffered little interference.{{sfn|Guerrero et al.|2002|p=37}} In 2003, a few FM stations were relocated to the nearby [[Condé Nast Building]] to reduce the number of broadcast stations using the Empire State Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cianci | first=P.J. | title=High Definition Television: The Creation, Development and Implementation of HDTV Technology | publisher=McFarland, Incorporated, Publishers | year=2013 | isbn=978-0-7864-8797-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mbsfr38GTgC&amp;pg=PA254 | access-date=October 23, 2017 | page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven [[Television broadcasting|television]] stations and twenty-two [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations had signed 15-year leases in the building by May 2003. It was expected that a taller broadcast tower in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], or [[Governors Island]], would be built in the meantime with the Empire State Building being used as a "backup" since signal transmissions from the building were generally of poorer quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bagli | first=Charles V. | title=Broadcasters Put Antennas In Midtown | website=The New York Times | date=May 12, 2003 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/12/nyregion/broadcasters-put-antennas-in-midtown.html | access-date=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the completion of [[1 World Trade Center]], some TV Stations began moving their transmitting facilities to 1 World Trade Center, while others, including [[WABC-TV]] remained at the Empire State Building, with no plans to consider a move to the new tower.

{{As of|2018}}, the Empire State Building is home to the following stations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiomap.us/us-ny/new-york|title=Radio stations in New York, NY|publisher=World Radio Map|accessdate=October 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027025152/http://www.radiomap.us/us-ny/new-york|archive-date=October 27, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Observation decks====
The 86th and 102nd floors contain observatories,{{sfn|Al-Kodmany|2017|p=71}}&lt;ref name=Lepik2008/&gt; which see a combined average of 4 million visitors per year.&lt;ref name="nyt20111225"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT-Million-Havent-Shown-2016&gt;{{cite web | last=Bagli | first=Charles V. | title=3.3 Million Were Expected at Trade Center Attraction; a Million Haven't Shown Up | website=The New York Times | date=May 28, 2016 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/28/nyregion/3-3-million-were-expected-at-trade-center-attraction-1-million-havent-shown-up.html | access-date=October 24, 2017|quote=the Empire State Building, whose two observatories are a veritable cash machine, drawing more than 4 million tourists annually}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Since opening, the observatories have been more popular than similar observatories at [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]], the Chrysler Building, the first One World Trade Center, or the [[Woolworth Building]], despite being more expensive.&lt;ref name="nyt20111225" /&gt; Tourists must pay to visit the observation deck on the 86th floor; there is an additional charge to visit the 102nd floor. Other ticket options for visitors include scheduled access to view the sunrise from the observatory, a “premium” guided tour with VIP access, and the “AM/PM” package which allows for two visits in the same day.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.esbnyc.com/tickets/index.cfm |title=ESB Tickets |publisher=Empire State Building |accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 86th floor observatory contains both an enclosed section and a wide-open section.{{sfn|Fodor's|2010|p=154}} The 102nd floor observatory is completely enclosed and much smaller. The 102nd floor observatory was closed to the public from the late 1990s to 2005.{{sfn|Fodor's|2010|p=154}} The observation decks were redesigned in mid-1979.&lt;ref name=oth19791128/&gt;

According to a 2010 report by [[Condé Nast Traveler|Concierge.com]], the five lines to enter the observation decks are "as legendary as the building itself". Concierge.com stated that there are five lines: the sidewalk line, the lobby elevator line, the ticket purchase line, the second elevator line, and the line to get off the elevator and onto the observation deck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concierge.com/ideas/hotspots/tours/500723?page=3 |title=Ten Things Not to Do in New York |publisher=Concierge.com |accessdate=October 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316041809/http://www.concierge.com/ideas/hotspots/tours/500723?page=3 |archivedate=March 16, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2016, New York City's official tourism website, NYCgo.com, made note of only three lines: the security check line, the ticket purchase line, and the second elevator line.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nycgo.com/tours/empire-state-building-tickets-observatory-and-optional-skip-the-line-ticket|title=Empire State Building Tickets – Observatory and Optional Skip the Line Tickets|last=|first=|date=May 10, 2016|work=The Official Guide to New York City|access-date=December 11, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an extra fee tourists can skip to the front of the line.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The Empire State Building garners significant revenue from ticket sales for its observation decks, making more money from ticket sales than it does from renting office space during some years.&lt;ref name="nyt20111225" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DaRo 23Apr2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/construction-property/article3391920.ece |title=No threat from large gorillas |author=David Robertson |date=April 23, 2012 |newspaper=The Times |accessdate=April 21, 2012 |quote=According to details prepared for the proposed initial public offering of Empire State Realty Trust, the skyscraper earned $62.9 million from its observation deck in nine months last year, compared with $62.6 million from the rental of office space.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lights====
[[File:Empire State Building Red and Green.JPG|thumb|Lighting at the top of the Building]]
The building was originally equipped with white [[searchlight]]s atop the tower. They saw their first use in November 1932 when they lit up to signal Roosevelt's victory over Hoover in the [[United States presidential election, 1932|presidential election of that year]].&lt;ref name="Melina 2010"&gt;{{cite web | last=Melina | first=Remy | title=What Do the Empire State Building's Lights Mean? | website=Live Science | date=August 24, 2010 | url=https://www.livescience.com/11147-empire-state-building-lights.html | access-date=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were later swapped for four "Freedom Lights" in 1956.&lt;ref name="Melina 2010"/&gt; In February 1964, flood lights were added on the 72nd floor{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=353}} to illuminate the top of the building at night so that the building could be seen from the World Fair later that year.&lt;ref name=nyt19640121&gt;

Since 1976, the spire has been lit in colors chosen to match seasonal events and holidays.

There have also been special occasions where the lights are modified from the usual schedule.

At 9:40 am on July 28, 1945, a [[B-25 Mitchell]] bomber, piloted in thick fog by Lieutenant Colonel William Franklin Smith Jr.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.457thbombgroup.org/New/750thSquad.html |title=750th Squadron 457th Bombardment Group: Officers&amp;nbsp;– 1943 to 1945 |accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building between the 79th and 80th floors where the offices of the [[National Catholic Welfare Council]] were located.{{sfn|Jackson|2010|pp=413–414}} One engine completely penetrated the building, landing on the roof of a nearby building where it started a fire that destroyed a penthouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1945/07/29/284668382.pdf|title=CRASH FIRE RUINS SCULPTOR'S STUDIO; PHOTO-DIAGRAM OF THE PLANE CRASH|last=|first=|date=July 29, 1945|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 24, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft causing a fire, which was extinguished in 40&amp;nbsp;minutes.

On May 1, 1947, [[Evelyn McHale]] leapt to her death from the 86th floor observation deck and landed on a [[limousine]] parked at the curb. Photography student Robert Wiles took a photo of McHale's oddly intact corpse a few minutes after her death. The police found a suicide note among possessions that she left on the observation deck: "He is much better off without me.... I wouldn't make a good wife for anybody".

== Importance ==

=== Iconic status===
[[File:Souvenirempirestate.JPG|thumb|upright|Souvenir of the building]]
As the tallest building in the world and the first one to exceed 100 floors, the Empire State Building immediately became an icon of the city and of the nation.&lt;ref name="Young Young 2007 p. 144"/&gt;{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|p=56}} In 2013, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine noted that the Empire State Building "seems to completely embody the city it has become synonymous with".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Empire State Building: A City Icon Turns 82 Amid Battle to Go Public | website=TIME | date=May 1, 2013 | url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/05/01/the-empire-state-building-an-icon-in-the-city/ | access-date=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian John Tauranac calls the tower "'the' twentieth-century New York building", despite the existence of taller and more [[Modern architecture|modernist]] buildings.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=19}} Early in the building's history, travel companies such as [[Short Line Motor Coach Service]] and [[New York Central Railroad]] used the building as an icon to symbolize the city.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=20}} After the construction of the first World Trade Center, architect [[Paul Goldberger]] noted that the Empire State Building "is famous for being tall, but it is good enough to be famous for being good."&lt;ref name=oth19791128/&gt;

As an icon of the United States, it is also very popular among Americans. In a 2007 survey, the American Institute of Architects found that the Empire State Building was "America's favorite building".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Empire State Building is America's Favorite | website=Bloomberg | date=February 9, 2007 | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2007-02-09/empire-state-building-is-americas-favoritebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice | access-date=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was originally a symbol of hope in a country devastated by the Depression, as well as a work of accomplishment by newer immigrants.&lt;ref name="Young Young 2007 p. 144"&gt;{{cite book | last=Young | first=William H. | last2=Young | first2=Nancy K. | title=The Great Depression in America: A Cultural Encyclopedia | publisher=Greenwood Press | series=The Great Depression in America: A Cultural Encyclopedia | issue=v. 2 | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-313-33522-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBljswTLaIEC&amp;pg=PA144 | access-date=October 25, 2017 | pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer Benjamin Flowers states that the Empire State was "a building intended to celebrate a new America, built by men (both clients and construction workers) who were themselves new Americans."{{sfn|Flowers|2001|p=72}} The architectural critic [[Jonathan Glancey]] refers to the building as an "icon of American design".&lt;ref name="Glancey 2013"/&gt;

The Empire State Building has been hailed as an example of a "[[Wonders of the World|wonder of the world]]" due to the massive effort expended during construction. ''[[The Washington Star]]'' listed it as part of one of the "seven wonders of the modern world" in 1931, while ''[[Holiday (magazine)|Holiday]]'' magazine wrote in 1958 that the Empire State's height would be taller than the combined heights of the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=19}} The American Society of Civil Engineers also declared the building "A Modern Civil Engineering Wonder of the United States" in 1958, and one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Modern World]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="ASCE Metropolitan Section"/&gt; Ron Miller, in a 2010 book, also described the Empire State Building as one of the "seven wonders of engineering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Miller | first=Ron | title=Seven Wonders of Engineering | publisher=Ebsco Publishing | series=Seven Wonders | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-7613-5989-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R0nN1h_1e7YC&amp;pg=PA15 | access-date=October 25, 2017 | pages=7–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has often been called the [[Eighth Wonder of the World]] as well, an appellation that it has held since shortly after opening.&lt;ref name="Dupre 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Perez | first=Judith | title=Empire State Building: The 8th World Wonder – A History in Photos | website=ABC News | date=May 1, 2012 | url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/05/the-8th-world-wonder/ | access-date=October 25, 2017 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026054240/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/05/the-8th-world-wonder/ | archivedate=October 26, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Associated Press"/&gt; The panels installed in the lobby in 1963 reflected this, showing the seven original wonders alongside the Empire State Building.&lt;ref name=arbus-bio/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20625">The '''Essar leaks''' include e-mails, office memos, telephone conversations and other records allegedly leaked from the systems of the Indian business conglomerate [[Essar Group]]. The leaked records allegedly contain evidence of politician-corporate nexus in India, and show how business interests unfairly manipulate Indian government and judiciary.

In 2015, an unnamed [[whistleblower]] leaked a set of internal e-mails and memos from the Essar Group, alleging that the conglomerate had granted favours to several politicians, bureaucrats and journalists. Essar denied the allegations, terming the alleged favours as "common courtesies" that are legally justifiable. Essar also claimed that some of the leaked material was fabricated, and was being used to [[blackmail]] them.

In May 2016, lawyer Suren Uppal reported the existence of a new set of secretly recorded conversations to the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]]. The conversations involve influential politicians, bureaucrats, businesspeople, bankers, and other [[very important person|VIP]]s. Uppal claimed to have received these tapes from the former Essar employee Albasit Khan, and alleged that the Essar officials illegally [[telephone tapping|tapped]] these conversations during the 2000s. In June 2016, after the ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'' magazine made Uppal's claims public, Khan denied Essar's role in tapping the conversations. He acknowledged the existence of the tapes, but stated he had received these tapes from the now-deceased [[Mumbai Police]] officer [[Vijay Salaskar]], a claim denied by Mumbai Police. According to Khan, the ultimate source and authenticity of the tapes are unknown. He admitted to having informed Uppal about the tapes, but accused Uppal of fabricating the Essar link to extort money from the business. Uppal denied the allegations, and promised to release the tapes to the [[Supreme Court of India]]. Essar completely denied the story, accusing Suren Uppal of being an extortionist.

== Background ==

=== 2015 leak: E-mails and memos ===

In 2015, a [[whistleblower]] approached lawyer-activist [[Prashant Bhushan]], and leaked a set of internal e-mails and memos from Essar Group. The material indicated that Essar Group had granted favours to several politicians, bureaucrats and journalists. This led to allegations that Essar had been trying to unfairly influence public policy and opinion. Bhushan's [[Centre for Public Interest Litigation]] (CPIL) filed a [[Public interest litigation in India|PIL]] before the [[Supreme Court of India]], requesting an investigation into these allegations.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/doing-needful-essar-industry-influence |title=Doing The Needful |author=Krishn Kaushik |publisher=Caravan |date=1 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Essar Group filed an affidavit seeking dismissal of the PIL, calling the favours as legally justifiable "common courtesies".&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/essar-calls-its-favours-to-government-officials-common-courtesies/ |title=Essar Group calls its favours to govt officials ‘common courtesies’ |author=Utkarsh Anand |newspaper=Indian Express |date=26 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 leak: Phone tapping ===

On 1 June 2016, the Delhi-based lawyer Suren Uppal submitted a 29-page complaint to [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]] alleging that Essar had [[telephone tapping|tapped]] VIP conversations during 2000s.&lt;ref name="IE_PMO_gets"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/essar-tapped-ambani-brothers-suresh-prabhu-atal-bihari-vajpayee-pmo-staff-rajiv-mehrishi-2857573/ |title=PMO gets complaint: Essar allegedly tapped Ambani brothers, Suresh Prabhu, Vajpayee PMO staff |newspaper=Indian Express |author=Ritu Sarin |date=17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Uppal, the Essar Group had carried out the [[cellphone surveillance|surveillance]] on the Prime Minister's Office (starting with [[Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee|A. B. Vajpayee]]), the cabinet ministers, government bureaucrats and rival businesspeople.&lt;ref name="Outlook_dismiss"/&gt;

According to Uppal, the tapping was done under the supervision of Albasit Khan (or Basit Khan), a former head of security and vigilance at Essar Group. Uppal claims to be Khan's former legal representative, and has alleged that Khan was forced to resign from Essar in 2011, after being accused of keeping back some of the recorded conversations.&lt;ref name="IE_PMO_gets"/&gt; He has alleged that "special mobile SIM cards or the mobile interceptor mobile SIM cards" were used to tap the conversations.&lt;ref name="IE_PMO_gets"/&gt; Until 2005, the surveillance was carried out over the [[BPL Mobile]] network, which had been under Essar's control. The network was also used by Essar's rival [[Reliance Industries Limited]] (RIL), which allowed Essar to tap their conversations. However, RIL moved out of this network after 2005. After that, Essar allegedly used [[Hutchison Essar|Hutchison]] network for the tapping.&lt;ref name="Outlook_dismiss"/&gt;

In June 2016, the ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'' magazine published a report on these tapped conversations.&lt;ref name="TNM_pillars"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/outlooks-essar-leaks-claim-reliance-remotely-controls-all-pillars-indian-democracy-45001 |title=Outlook's Essar leaks: Tapes claim Reliance remotely controls all pillars of Indian democracy |publisher=The News Minute |date=17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Albasit Khan told the media that Essar had not recorded these conversations, and stated that their source and authenticity were unknown. Khan acknowledged the existence of tapes containing the conversations, but stated that the [[Mumbai Police]] officer [[Vijay Salaskar]] had given these tapes to him for "safekeeping" in 2005. Mumbai Police denied this, and ''Outlook'' doubted Khan's claim, pointing out that the tapes include conversations from as late as 2011.&lt;ref name="Outlook_dismiss"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/mumbai-police-dismiss-essar-whistle-blowers-claim-that-crime-branch-was-tapes-so/296982 |title=Mumbai Police Dismiss Essar Whistle-Blower's Claim That Crime Branch Was Tapes' Source |publisher=Outlook |author=Meetu Jain |date=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan admitted that had had met Uppal in January 2016, and had informed him about the tapes. But he denied hiring Uppal as his lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/essar-leaks-how-the-story-changed-overnight-1466238985.html |title=Essar leaks: How the story changed overnight |author=Charu Kartikeya |publisher=Catch News |date=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan alleged Uppal of fabricating the Essar link to extort money from the business.&lt;ref name="IE_slams"/&gt; In response, Uppal claimed that he and Khan had been working to "expose" the tapping, but Khan backed out under Essar Group's influence. He promised to hand over the alleged tapes to the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] as part of a [[Public interest litigation in India|Public Interest Litigation]] (PIL).&lt;ref name="IE_slams"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/vvips-phone-tapping-ex-essar-employee-slams-lawyer-suren-uppal-who-in-turn-shows-emails-to-establish-link-2859990/ |title=Ex-Essar employee slams lawyer Uppal who, in turn, shows emails to ‘establish link’ |author=Ritu Sarin |newspaper=Indian Express |date=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content of the leaks ==

The Essar leaks allegedly show that the businesses unfair influencely influenced the Indian government and judiciary during both [[United Progressive Alliance|UPA]] and [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|NDA]] tenures.&lt;ref name="TNM_pillars"/&gt; The leaks include the following:

* A November 2002 conversation between politicians Amar Singh and Kunwar Akhilesh Singh reveals how Amar Singh lobbied in favour of [[Reliance Petroleum]] as a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee.&lt;ref name="TNM_pillars"/&gt;
* A December 2002 converstaion between RIL executives Mukesh Ambani and Satish Seth discusses how the Supreme Court was "managed" through minister [[Pramod Mahajan]].&lt;ref name="TNM_pillars"/&gt;
* In another conversation, Mukesh Ambani and Satish Seth discuss how to break the [[Cellular Operators Association of India]] by paying millions to MP [[Rajeev Chandrasekhar]] and the [[BPL Mobile]] founder.&lt;ref name="TNM_pillars"/&gt;
* In a June 2009 memo, senior executive Sunil Bajaj suggested giving 200 high-end cell phones to senior politicians and bureaucrats of the new UPA government, in order to "invest on right people at the right places for reaping long-term benefits". He stated that [[Airtel]] and [[Reliance Telecom|Reliance]] were already "experiencing the benefits" of this strategy.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/wooing-politicians-with-high-end-phones-journalists-with-cabs/ |title=Essar Leaks: Wooing politicians with high-end phones, journalists with cabs |author=Appu Esthose Suresh and Ritu Sarin |newspaper=Indian Express |date=27 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In another 2009 e-mail, Sunil Bajaj suggested earmarking at least 200 recruitment slots for job referrals from powerful politicians and bureaucrats. He argued that the recommended candidates were often "highly qualified", so the company would not have a problem hiring them.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;
* Later e-mails from 2012 and 2013 show that Essar hired at least 60 people recommended by VIPs, which included:&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"/&gt;
** [[Beni Prasad Verma]], [[Indian National Congress]] (INC)
** [[Digvijaya Singh]], INC
** [[Prabhat Jha (politician)|Prabhat Jha]], [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]]
** Mohan Prakash, INC general secretary
** [[Motilal Vora]], INC
** Sanjeev Kumar, private secretary to the contemporary INC Minister for Petroleum &amp; Natural Gas
** [[Sriprakash Jaiswal]], INC
** [[Varun Gandhi]], BJP
** [[Yashbant Narayan Singh Laguri]], [[Biju Janata Dal]]
* In one e-mail, Essar's corporate communications executive stated that she had "coordinated" a story about Essar's involvement in the [[2G spectrum case]], in the magazines ''[[Tehelka]]'' and ''[[Business Today (business magazine)|Business Today]]''. Prashant Bhushan identified the ''Tehelka'' story as ''Madness in CBI's method'', written by the journalist [[Ashish Khetan]] (now an [[Aam Aadmi Party]] [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]]). In this article, Khetan criticized the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] for unfairly targeting Essar in the scam investigation. The article was published in December 2011, a month after Essar paid Tehelka {{INR}} 30 million as sponsorship amount for the magazine's ''Think Fest'' event.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;
* A set of e-mails reveal that the Steel ministry's joint secretary Syedain Abbasi was granted accommodation at Essar's guest house in Delhi, although he was eligible for government-granted accommodation. In a 2013 email, the Essar executive Rajamani Krishnamurti describes Abbasi as "a very important person" who was handling the "majority of Essar’s issues". The e-mail reveals that Abbasi had advised Essar to oppose a particular government proposal through industry bodies such as [[ASSOCHAM]], [[Confederation of Indian Industry|CII]], and [[Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry|FICCI]].&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;
* An e-mail sent by Sunil Bajaj before the [[Diwali]] festival of 2013 suggested distributing gifts "to person in the middle and the lower ranks in various ministries, who are very vital in sustenance and procurement of important information and documents." The e-mail indicate that the Essar officials had access to confidential government communication from multiple ministries, including Coal, Environment, Finance, Petroleum, Railways, Shipping and Steel. The Essar officials were in close contact with the Petroleum Minister [[Veerappa Moily]], and had access to the 2012-13 budget proposals for his Ministry.&lt;ref name="Caravan_needful"/&gt;
* E-mail correspondence between Essar executives shows that BJP leader [[Nitin Gadkari]] and his family enjoyed a 2-night stay on an Essar luxury yacht in [[French Riviera]] during 7–9 July 2013. Essar also arranged their stay on the [[Sunrays (yacht)|Sunrays]] yacht for a day, including a helicopter trip to and from the [[Nice]] airport.&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"/&gt;
* Essar's internal records show that the company executives regularly arranged cabs for some Delhi-based journalists.&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"/&gt; These journalists included Anupama Airy (''Hindustan Times''), Meetu Jain (''[[CNN-IBN]]''), and Sandeep Bamzai (''Mail Today'').&lt;ref name="IE_journalists_resign"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/essar-leaks-2-journalists-resign-third-put-on-notice/ |title=Essar Leaks: 2 journalists resign, third put on notice |author=Archna Shukla |newspaper=Indian Express |date=28 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

=== Essar Group ===

In the 2015 affidavit seeking dismissial of CPIL's request for investigation, the Essar Group stated that they had not derived any benefits from the alleged favours. The affidavit stated that there was no evidence of any criminal offence by Essar Group, and the alleged favours "common courtesies extended by corporate houses".&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"/&gt;

Essar filed a police complaint for data theft, and threatened legal action against media outlets that publish "any allegations based on any email stolen from the system":&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/essar-leaks-french-cruise-for-gadkari-favours-to-upa-minister-journalists/ |title=Essar Leaks: French cruise for Nitin Gadkari, favours to UPA Minister, journalists |author=Appu Esthose Suresh and Ritu Sarin |newspaper=Indian Express |date=27 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the last few weeks we have received anonymous phone calls from people purported to have mail stolen from our systems and on which basis there have been some demands for money at the threat of publishing prejudicial material. It is curious that some of the queries reflect the kind of material on which we were sought to be blackmailed.

It is apparent that some of the material is fabricated and some of the allegations are conclusions and inferences being drawn from email stolen from our computers.|Essar Group press statement, 2015}}

When ''[[The Caravan]]'' published a cover story critical of the company, the Essar group filed a {{INR}} 2500 million [[defamation]] suit against the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.livemint.com/Companies/l7p8QtAzYYCRFzRHWVTZ0I/SC-declines-to-transfer-Essar-defamation-suit-against-Carav.html |title=SC declines to transfer Essar defamation suit against ‘Caravan’ to Delhi |author=Shreeja Sen |publisher=Live Mint |date=9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essar also questioned the authenticity of the leaked e-mails, calling them "unverified" and "pure hearsay". It stated that the company had not recruited people based solely on VIP recommendations, calling such recommendations legal and proper in Indian context.&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"/&gt;

Essar accused CPIL of launching a smear campaign against them to seek publicity.&lt;ref name="IE_courtesies"/&gt;

=== People named in the leaks ===

BJP leader Nitin Gadkari denied extending any favours to the Essar Group, while commenting on his Essar-sponsored yacht stays. He stated that he was not a minister or the BJP President at the time, and paid for his family's Norway vacation using his own money. When Ruias (Essar owners) learned that he was visiting Europe, they invited him to their yacht as a family friend.&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"/&gt;

Sriprakash Jaiswal and Digvijaya Singh defended themselves stating they regularly make referrals to companies, to help unemployed people. Varun Gandhi stated that his office regularly gave letters of recommendations to educated unemployed youth after "satisfying their bonafide credentials."&lt;ref name="IE_cruise"/&gt;

Journalists Anupama Airy and Sandeep Bamzai resigned after being named among those for whom Essar had arranged cabs.&lt;ref name="IE_journalists_resign"/&gt; Airy stated that she had requested a cab from Essar "as help from a friend", and not as a journalist. She also expressed displeasure at being singled out, stating that other journalists at ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' had sought such help from businesses in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/socials/602 |title=Hindustan Times journalist who quit over Essar leaks questions senior editors about professional ethics |author=Dhanya Rajendran |publisher=The News Minute |date=2 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamzai denied publishing any biased news to favour Essar Group, and stated that asking them for a cab was simply "a stupid mistake". Meetu Jain had asked Essar for a cab in 2012, when she was working with CNN-IBN. At the time her name was released, she was working as a Deputy News Editor at [[Times Now]], which initiated an internal inquiry against her.&lt;ref name="IE_journalists_resign"/&gt;

=== Others ===

The [[Aam Aadmi Party]] and the [[Indian National Congress]] demanded that the alleged tapes be made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/congress-responds-to-indian-express-report-on-essar-tapes-demands-the-tapes-be-made-public-2858448/ |title=Congress responds to Indian Express report on Essar tapes, demands the tapes be made public |newspaper=Indian Express |date=17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/essar-leaks-aap-joins-chorus-demands-the-tapes-be-made-public-2861057/ |title=Essar leaks: AAP joins chorus, demands the tapes be made public |newspaper=Indian Express |date=18 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] ordered the Home Ministry to conduct an inquiry, and submit a detailed report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/essar-leaks-narendra-modi-indian-express/1/695383.html |title=Modi orders probe into Essar leaks, asks Home Ministry to submit report |author=Rahul Kanwal |publisher=India Today |date=19 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17084">The '''ethics involved within pharmaceutical sales''' is built from the [[organizational ethics]], which is a matter of system compliance, accountability and culture (Grace &amp; Cohen, 2005). Organizational ethics are used when developing the marketing and sales strategy to both the public and the healthcare profession of the strategy.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127"&gt;{{cite news |author=The Editorial Board |title=Turn the Volume Down on Drug Ads |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/opinion/turn-the-volume-down-on-drug-ads.html |date=November 27, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational ethics are best demonstrated through acts of fairness, compassion, integrity, honor, and responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Example of organizational ethics|last=Suttle|first=Rick|date=2016|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|publisher=Houston Chronicle|access-date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
The pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive business and its success is dependent on the sales and marketing of each drug.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127" /&gt; The cost of research and development for each drug is hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2005 the research and development expenditure for the biopharmaceutical industry within Europe and the US was 15,474 million euro.(The Pharma Industry Figures, 2006). Some health economists peg the current cost of drug development at US$1.3 billion, others at US$1.7 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2630351 | pmid=19188620 | doi=10.1503/cmaj.082040 | volume=180 | title=Drug development cost estimates hard to swallow | year=2009 | journal=CMAJ | pages=279–80 | last1 = Collier | first1 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual [[drug discovery]] and the [[drug development]] can take years. After which, testing and clinical trials are required prior to getting approval by regulatory boards. After launching the drug the company has much at stake as it has already outlaid millions of dollars the success of its sales is an important factor to the success of the company.

== Sales practices ==
A pharmaceutical sales representative is the key part within the sales of all drugs.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127" /&gt; They are responsible to ensure the healthcare profession is informed of the benefits of the drug along with the safety and the side effects to assist a healthcare profession as the correct information and choices to prescribe medication to the patients. The term used is ethical promotion, which can be described as communication of ethical values to promote their product to the physician. (Wright &amp; Lundstrom, 2004)

== Regulations and guidelines ==

=== European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations ===
The [[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]] (EFPIA) stipulates that there is a Corporate Social responsibility for the pharmaceutical industry to recognize and acknowledge the need to act responsibly towards society and the communities in which it operates.

The EFPIA has also code of practice on the promotion of medicine, which entails the regulations over many areas of the promotion of medicine. These include events and hospitality that can be extended by a pharmaceutical company. Gifts and inducements must be inexpensive and provide value to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. All medical sales representatives must have the adequate training and sufficient scientific knowledge to provide relevant and precise information about the products. They must also comply with the requirements of the applicable codes.

===Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America===
{{main article | Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America}}
In 2002 the [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]], issued a set of guidelines for its member companies to follow when it comes to the relationship between drug reps and doctors. The voluntary code significantly changed how drug company representatives interact with doctors. Changes range from restricting gifts to limiting consulting contracts offered to doctors.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"&gt;{{cite news |title=Just what the doctor ordered |author=Anderson, Tania |newspaper=Baltimore Business Journal |date=27 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PhRMA was inspired to come up with the code after years of criticism from groups like [[Families USA]] and [[Public Citizen]]. PhRMA already had a set of guidelines on this topic but its board decided that one of the best ways to thwart the criticism and prevent any appearance of impropriety was to come up with a stricter code.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"/&gt;

"The PhRMA guidelines are one major factor contributing to a paradigm shift that directly impacts the way our industry conducts business,""Because of this shift, pharmaceutical sales forces must learn new and more compelling ways to create and keep customers, or perish because physicians are no longer willing to listen to their usual approach,"  said Susan Torroella, CEO of Columbia MedCom Group.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"/&gt;

PhRMA is opposed to state laws that regulate interaction between [[pharmaceutical sales representative]]s and health care providers. PhRMA officials said state regulations could create a patchwork of conflicting rules across the states that might do more to confuse sales representatives and doctors than prevent improper perks."We do have the comprehensive guidelines combined with the guidelines of the Office of Inspector General. Not only would state laws be a duplication, it could be nightmarish because you would have differing standards for different states," said Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for PhRMA.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"/&gt;

After PhRMA enacted its guidelines, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued guidelines similar to PhRMA's code, except with more severe penalties. Companies that fail to follow the department's rules could face a federal investigation that could lead to civil penalties.&lt;ref name="Baltimore"/&gt;

==Health care fraud==
{{See also|List of largest pharmaceutical settlements in the United States|List of off-label promotion pharmaceutical settlements}}
[[Pharmaceutical fraud]] involves activities that result in false claims to insurers or programs such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in the United States or equivalent state programs for financial gain to a pharmaceutical company.&lt;ref name="NYT-20151127" /&gt; There are several different schemes&lt;ref name="FBIFraudTypes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/fcs_report2006/financial-crimes-report-to-the-public-fiscal-year-2006#Health|publisher=FBI|year=2006|title=Financial Crimes to the Public Report 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; used to defraud the [[health care system]] which are particular to the pharmaceutical industry. These include: Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Violations, Off Label Marketing, Best Price Fraud, CME Fraud, Medicaid Price Reporting, and Manufactured Compound Drugs. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) estimates that [[health care fraud]] costs American taxpayers $60 billion a year.&lt;ref name="FBIHealthCareGeneral"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/white_collar/health-care-fraud|title=FBI-Health Care Fraud|publisher=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this amount $2.5 billion was recovered through ''False Claims Act'' cases in FY 2010. Examples of fraud cases include the [[Pfizer]] $2.3 billion settlement and [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] $650 million settlement. Damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the [[False Claims Act]], most commonly under the ''[[qui tam]]'' provisions which rewards an individual for being a "[[whistleblower]]", or [[relator (law)]].&lt;ref name="DOJHealthCareFraudReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/tne/health_care.html|title=Department of Justice|publisher=Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antipsychotic drugs are now the top-selling class of pharmaceuticals in America, generating annual revenue of about $14.6 billion. Every major company selling the drugs — [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], [[Eli Lilly]], [[Pfizer]], [[AstraZeneca]] and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] — has either settled recent government cases, under the False Claims Act, for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud. Following charges of illegal marketing, two of the settlements set records last year for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations. One involved Eli Lilly’s antipsychotic [[Zyprexa]], and the other involved  [[Bextra]]. In the Bextra case, the government also charged Pfizer with illegally marketing another antipsychotic, [[Geodon]]; Pfizer settled that part of the claim for $301 million, without admitting any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=bied2010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits |author=Duff Wilson |date=October 2, 2010  |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No Free Lunch ===
{{main article | No Free Lunch (organization) }}
Some physicians have joined an organization No free lunch which asked physicians to make a pledge to not accept any pharmaceutical companies gifts no matter how large or small. The members base that gift giving forms relationships, which influences behaviour and creates a conflict of interest. (No Free Lunch)

===Coalition of Immokalee Workers===
The Fair Food Program emerged from the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]]' Campaign for Fair Food. The campaign was launched in 2001 by farmworkers in [[Immokalee]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Fair Food Program Report 2015." Fair Food Standards Council, n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fair Food Standards Council===
The Fair Food Standards Council (FFSC) oversees the program and ensures that standards are upheld. Judge Laura Safer Espinoza, a retired New York State Supreme Court Justice is the Executive Director of the FFSC.&lt;ref&gt;"Fair Food Program." Coalition of Immokalee Workers. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 2005, after the CIW boycotted Taco Bell for almost four years, the company agreed to sign a Fair Food Agreement, committing the company to pay a “penny more per pound” on its tomatoes, to be passed on as wage bonus to tomato harvesters, and to work with CIW to improve conditions in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;CIW Taco Bell joint press release. 9 March 2005. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; [[College]] campuses were a major impetus for this agreement; twenty-two colleges banned Taco Bell from operating.&lt;ref&gt;"Immokalee Tomato Pickers Win Campaign Against Taco Bell." Democracy Now! n.d. Web. 12 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The CIW then targeted McDonald’s for two years; in 2007, McDonald's signed a Fair Food Agreement with CIW.&lt;ref&gt;"US Farmworkers Reach Historic Agreement with McDonald's." Oxfam America. N.p., n.d. Web. 15 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Other fast-food chains and food retailers followed suit.

Despite this success, in 2007, the Florida Tomato Growers, which is the state’s largest tomato producer, slowed the CIW’s progress. They threatened farms with $100,000 worth of fines if they passed through "penny per pound" monies. In 2010, Pacific Tomato Growers and Lipman, two of the nation’s largest producers, signed on to the program, effectively ending the industry boycott. Just months later, the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange signed onto the Fair Food Program, which began widespread implementation of the model.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, Steven. "In Florida Tomato Fields, a Penny Buys Progress." The New York Times. The New York Times, 24 Apr. 2014. Web. 25 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walmart joined the Fair Food Program on January 16, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;"PRESS RELEASE: Coalition of Immokalee Workers Announces Walmart to Join Groundbreaking Fair Food Program." Coalition of Immokalee Workers. N.p., n.d. Web. 13 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The company sells 20% of the United States’ fresh tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, Steven. "In Florida Tomato Fields, a Penny Buys Progress." The New York Times. The New York Times, 24 Apr. 2014. Web. 25 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Walmart additionally agreed to help  expand the Program outside of Florida and expand into other crops.&lt;ref&gt;"PRESS RELEASE: Coalition of Immokalee Workers Announces Walmart to Join Groundbreaking Fair Food Program." Coalition of Immokalee Workers. N.p., n.d. Web. 13 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation and expansion==

The Fair Food Program has completed four year of implementation across the Florida tomato industry as well as its first year of expansion to Florida-based tomato growers’ operations in Georgia, North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey. The program is currently expanding to strawberries and green bell peppers in Florida. The Fair Food Standards Council publishes detailed metrics annually, charting the program's implementation.&lt;ref&gt;"Fair Food Program Report 2015." Fair Food Standards Council, n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success==
From November 2011 through September 2015, farmworkers have brought forth over 1100 complaints. The FFSC has conducted more than 120 audits, interviewed 12,000 workers and completed 45 site visits. The CIW has conducted 400 education sessions, which has educated 35,000 workers about their rights. Buyers have paid nearly $20 million in the Fair Food Premium, which goes directly to workers as a line-item bonus on their paychecks.&lt;ref&gt;"Fair Food Program Report 2015." Fair Food Standards Council. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the CIW, “today, virtually all Florida tomato growers have joined the Fair Food Program.&lt;ref&gt;Burkhalter, Holly. "Fair Food Program Helps End the Use of Slavery in the Tomato Fields." Washington Post. The Washington Post, 02 Sept. 2012. Web. 17 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;” "'When I first visited Immokalee, I heard appalling stories of abuse and modern slavery,' said Susan L. Marquis, dean of the Pardee RAND Graduate School, a public policy institution in Santa Monica, Calif. 'But now the tomato fields in Immokalee are probably the best working environment in American agriculture. In the past three years, they’ve gone from being the worst to the best.'" &lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, Steve. "In Florida Tomato Fields, A Penny Buys Progress." The New York Times, 24 Apr. 2014. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; ”

'''Fountain Place''' is a 60-story [[Modern architecture|late-modernist]] [[skyscraper]] in [[downtown Dallas]], [[Texas]]. Standing at a structural height of {{convert|720|ft|abbr=on}}, it is the [[List of tallest buildings in Dallas|fifth-tallest building in Dallas]], and the [[Tallest buildings in Texas|15th-tallest in Texas]].

==Design==
[[File:View from Reunion Tower August 2015 21.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Fountain Place as viewed from [[Reunion Tower]] in August 2015]]

Original plans for the project called for twin towers, with the second tower rotated 90 degrees from the original, to be built on an adjacent block, but with the [[1979 energy crisis|collapse of the Texas oil]], banking and real estate industry and the [[savings and loan scandal]] of in the 1980s, the project was never completed. 

The building was designed by the award winning architects [[Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners]], with [[Henry N. Cobb]] as design partner, and was completed in 1986. 

The building gets its name from the array of 172 dancing [[fountain]]s in the plaza at its base with a fully automated water show as the centerpiece. The fountains were an extreme undertaking and the first concept of their kind on such a large scale{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. [[WET (company)|WET]] Design company was brought in to facilitate the project; it was the company's first major project since the founders left Disney to team up. WET collaborated with the firm of [[I. M. Pei]] as well as landscape architects [[Dan Kiley]] and Peter Ker Walker to create the waterscape of Fountain Place (at Allied Bank Tower) in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. The project showed the first use of WET's patented open-jointed paving in a fountain where shots of water appear from the openings in the plaza's surface. After completion of Fountain Place, WET went on to design other notable fountains such as the [[Bellagio (resort)|Bellagio]] fountains in Las Vegas and [[The Dubai Fountain]].

The building is known for its unique architecture&amp;mdash;it was designed as a large, multi-faceted prism.  Its various slanted sides cause the building to have a completely different profile from all directions.

==History==
At the time of its opening it was the second tallest building in the city behind Bank of America. However, upon completion of Comerica Bank Tower and Chase Tower it fell to fourth. Renaissance Tower then added an antenna spire atop of its roof to vault itself back into skyline notoriety and supplant Fountain Place to fifth tallest.  

On September 24, 2009 the FBI arrested 19-year-old [[Hosam Maher Husein Smadi]] of [[Jordan]] for an alleged attempt to bomb the skyscraper. Smadi was living and working in [[Italy, Texas]], and had been under FBI investigation for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Jason Trahan |author2=Todd J.

==Tenants==
Fountain Place is the headquarters of [[Tenet Healthcare]]. Tenet Healthcare announced in 2008 that it was moving from the northern suburban areas of Dallas to Fountain Place due to high gasoline prices and the revitalization of [[downtown Dallas]]. Trevor Fetter, the company's then president and chief executive, credited the [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] [[DART Light Rail|light rail]] and the concept of an urban location for his decision to move to Downtown Dallas.

Fountain Place contains many financial institutions and offices including Wells Fargo. Originally cited as First Interstate Tower or Allied Bank Tower, it was after the 1988 merger of Wells Fargo that the building became known as Fountain Place, becoming the only major skyscraper in Dallas not to lend its name to the occupying bank.

Fountain Place also serves as Region 6 headquarters for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. 

[[Hunt Oil Company|Hunt Oil]] operated out of Fountain Place until they built new headquarters across the street in 2007.

==In popular culture==
In seasons 10–14 of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', exterior shots of the building were used for the offices of Bobby Ewing's Petro Group Dallas, which later became [[Ewing Oil]].

The building's dancing fountains were used for scenes in the movie [[Blank Check (film)|Blank Check]].

Exterior shots of the building are seen in the [[USA Network]] TV series [[Queen of the South (TV series)|Queen of the South]].

The '''Greater Cleveland Aquarium''' is an [[public aquarium|aquarium]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], USA. Occupying the historic [[FirstEnergy]] Powerhouse building located on the west bank of the [[Cuyahoga River]] in the city's [[The Flats|Flats]] district, the aquarium which opened in January 2012 consists of approximately {{convert|70000|ft2|m2}} of exhibition space and features exhibits representing both local and exotic species of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Kosich |coauthors= |title=Greater Cleveland Aquarium to Open in October |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/cleveland_metro/greater-cleveland-aquarium-to-open-in-october |publisher=[[WEWS-TV]] |date=2011-02-14 |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility is the only free standing aquarium in the state of Ohio and ends a 26-year period that the city lacked a public aquarium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tina |last=Kaufmann |coauthors= |title=Greater Cleveland Aquarium Will Open Doors in Late January |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/cleveland_metro/greater-cleveland-aquarium-will-open-doors-in-late-january |publisher=WEWS-TV |date=2011-11-17 |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The former Cleveland Aquarium opened on February 6, 1954, and was located on the city's near-east side in [[Gordon Park, Cleveland|Gordon Park]]. It was created by the Cleveland Aquarium Society, a group formed in the 1940s, the City of Cleveland and the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]], which operated the facility. The aquarium was housed in a building constructed in the 1930s that previously served as bath house. In 1943, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History converted it into a trailside museum, displaying local flora and fauna as well as exhibits of freshwater fish of [[Lake Erie]]. That museum closed in 1953 when the [[Cleveland Memorial Shoreway]] cut Gordon Park in two.

In the early 1950s, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, which had previously had aquatic exhibits on its second floor of former home, moved to its own new building and consolidated its aquatic collection into the Cleveland Aquarium. The old Gordon Park trailside museum was renovated by Cleveland Aquarium Society volunteers for about $25,000.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://clevelandaquariumsociety.org/history/3-history|title = History|date = |accessdate = |website = Cleveland Aquarium Society|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aquarium had 50 freshwater and marine exhibits including [[sharks]], [[swordfish]], [[sawfish]], [[seahorses]], [[eels]], [[squid]], [[octopus]], and [[coral]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It acquired a pair of [[Australian lungfish]] in 1966 and a school of red-bellied [[piranhas]] in 1970. Under the Natural History Museum's direction, the aquarium often drew more visitors than the building could handle. A $300,000 gift from the [[Leonard C. Hanna Jr.|Leonard C. Hanna Foundation]] financed the construction of a new octagonal wing in 1967 that tripled the aquarium's size and increased its tank capacity from {{convert|8000|to(-)|82000|gal|l}}.

Despite annual deficits experienced during decade, a city council override of a mayoral veto to increase the admission charges and keep aquarium operations with the museum was performed in 1979.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Structural problems with the building forced the closing of the aquarium to the public in June 1985.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The former aquarium site then became a police dog training facility for the City of Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=GP1 |title=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History:GORDON PARK |publisher=Ech.case.edu |date=2006-10-23 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 1986, fish and exhibits were moved to the [[Cleveland Metroparks Zoo]],&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; where they remain today in the Primate, Cat &amp; Aquatics Building.&lt;ref name=aqplans2&gt;{{cite news |first=Gabriel |last=Baird |coauthors= |title=Jacobs plans to bring aquarium to Powerhouse in the Flats|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/06/jacobs_plans_to_bring_aquarium.html|publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2012-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebirth of Cleveland aquarium===
The second iteration was conceived in 2009.&lt;ref name=aqplans&gt;{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=O'Donnell |coauthors= |title=Greater Cleveland Aquarium to Open in October |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/06/cleveland_aquarium_inc_plans_d.html|publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=2009-06-19 |accessdate=2012-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally envisioned as a more ambitious {{convert|100000|-|125000|ft2|m2}} facility that would cost over $50 million. However, planning of various forms occurred since the defunct Cleveland Aquarium closed in 1985.&lt;ref name="aqplans2"/&gt; Although there were competing interests, the driving force behind the project was Jeffrey Jacobs, a local developer who was set on having a paying tenant for the Powerhouse, a complex he owned.

The eventual facility was a collaboration controlled by Jacobs. It was financed by a $2 million loan from the City of Cleveland, a $1.25 million investment from Marinescape, and an $11.75 million investment from the Nautica Phase 2 Limited Partnership, an affiliate of [[Jacobs Entertainment]]. The facility also supported by FirstEnergy and AMPCO, the parking lot operator for the Nautica Complex.

A [[ribbon-cutting ceremony]] was held for the aquarium January 19, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Annette |last=Lawless |coauthors= |title=Ribbon Cutting Ceremony Held for Cleveland Aquarium |url=http://www.fox8.com/news/wjw-news-cleveland-aquarium-ribbon-cutting,0,300585.story |publisher=[[WJW-TV]] |date=2012-01-19 |accessdate=2012-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aquarium opening to the general public on January 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Regina |last=Garcia Cano |coauthors= |title=Greater Cleveland Aquarium Opens its Doors to the Public |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2012/01/greater_cleveland_aquarium_ope_1.html |work=The Plain Dealer |date=2012-01-21 |accessdate=2012-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs Entertainment purchased the aquarium outright in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jacobs takes over ownership of the Greater Cleveland Aquarium; new exhibits announced|newspaper=Akron Beacon Journal|date=June 3, 2014|url=https://www.ohio.com/akron/pages/jacobs-takes-over-ownership-of-the-greater-cleveland-aquarium-new-exhibits-announced|accessdate=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facility==
The total cost of the facility was roughly $33 million: $18 million for the building and its related infrastructure and $15 million for aquarium exhibits.

At the January 2012 opening, the aquarium 8 exhibition areas, including Ohio Lakes &amp; Rivers, Lakes &amp; Rivers of the World, Discovery Zone, Indo-Pacific, Northern Pacific, Coastal, Coral Reef and a main Shark SeaTube. It features a {{convert|230000|gal|l|adj=on}} tank with a {{convert|175|ft|m|adj=on}} acrylic [[shark tunnel]] offering panoramic views of marine life, including sharks of various species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greaterclevelandaquarium.com/experience/galleries/shark-seatube/ |title=Shark SeaTube |publisher=Greater Cleveland Aquarium |date= |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La Caravelle''' was a restaurant in [[New York City]], specialising in [[French cuisine]]. It opened on September 21, 1960, at 33 West 55th Street in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=Caravelle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lacaravelle.com/brand-history/|title=A Classic That Always Looks to the Future|publisher=Lacaravelle.com|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/12/dining/la-caravelle-a-french-legend-is-closing-after-43-years.html|title=La Caravelle, a French Legend, Is Closing After 43 Years|newspaper=New York Times|date=12 May 2004|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant was established by Fred Decré and Robert Meyzen, with Roger Fessaguet as head chef, and took its name from the type of [[caravel|sailing ships]] [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed on his voyages to the [[New World]]. 
Like most European restaurants, ''La Caravelle'' had a menu that changed daily.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; This made the restaurant popular with new customers and also brought them back regularly. [[Salvador Dalí]], [[John Lindsay]], [[Leland Hayward]], [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] often dined at the restaurant in its early years. President [[John F. Kennedy]] was especially fond of ''La Caravelle''{{'}}s [[vichyssoise]] and chicken in champagne sauce, and he often requested them as "take out" orders to eat on the plane while traveling.  
 
Twenty years after its opening, chef Roger Fessaguet left the kitchen to become an owner with Meyzen due to the retirement of Fred Decré. In 1984,  Robert Meyzen retired and Fessaguet and André Jammet took over ownership of the restaurant. The following year, a ''[[New York Magazine]]'' article cited it as one of the best restaurants in New York City, and mentioned that most guidebooks gave it their highest rating. Fessaguet retired in 1988, leaving ownership with Jammet and his wife. The Jammets redecorated ''La Caravelle'' in 1990, replacing the original red carpets and banquettes with a color scheme of green and peach.  Artist Nina Duran was hired to create a small mural for the restaurant's foyer. The restaurant closed on May 22, 2004, despite garnering the [[James Beard Foundation]]'s Most Outstanding Restaurant in the Country award in the same year. The name is now known for champagnes produced by the Jammets; the restaurant began serving them as its house brand in 1997.

==History==
The restaurant was originally owned by Fred Decré and Robert Meyzen, with Roger Fessaguet as head chef. Decré and Meyzen, maîtres d’hôtel at ''[[Le Pavillon]]'', left there to open the restaurant in midtown Manhattan's Shoreham Hotel, hiring Fessaquet, who also worked at ''Le Pavillon'', as its first executive chef.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; The restaurant's name was taken from the type of [[caravel|sailing ships]] [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed on his voyages to the [[New World]] and represented their hopes for a new beginning in the restaurant business with its opening.&lt;ref name=Caravelle/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;  Artist Jean Pagès was hired to create a series of murals depicting typical Parisian scenes for the space that was a [[speakeasy]] during [[Prohibition in the United States|the Prohibition era]].&lt;ref name=Caravelle/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=murals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lacaravelle.com/la-caravelle-murals/|title=La Caravelle Murals|publisher=La Caravelle|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pagès added to the restaurant's murals in the 1960s; his work was accidentally altered by fellow artist [[Salvador Dalí]] when Dali scratched one of the murals with his cane while dining there with friends.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=murals/&gt;

==Lunch preparation at ''La Caravelle''==
By 7:30 a.m., head chef Fessaguet had decided on the day's lunch menu, estimated the number of diners ''La Caravelle'' would have and ordered the provisions for it.  An hour later, the fresh vegetables were being peeled and sliced and the various sauces were on the stoves. The restaurant's pastry chef began his work on the various pastries and desserts for the day's lunch; the lunch preparations were completed and the kitchen staff could sit down for lunch. By noon, the waiters had donned their uniforms and the prepared food was on silver trays on a kitchen table.  At 12:45, the orders for the day's luncheon guests began coming into the kitchen; by 2 p.m., 92 patrons had been served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2370579/lunch_at_la_caravelle/|title=Preparation of French Cuisine|author=Gerston, Jill|work=Ames Daily Tribune|page=10|date=16 August 1974|accessdate=7 May 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1973, ''La Caravelle''{{'}}s preparations for lunch were the subject of a short film, ''French Lunch,'' which depicts the behind-the scenes preparations of a meal at the restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2370756/la_caravelle_short_film/|title=McMillan Library Offers 14 New Films For Lending|date=16 October 1973|page=3|work=The Daily Tribune|accessdate=7 May 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management and cuisine changes==
Twenty years after its opening, chef Roger Fessaguet left the kitchen to become an owner with Meyzen due to the retirement of Fred Decré.&lt;ref name=Caravelle/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/04/nyregion/roger-fessaguet-a-wizard-of-haute-cuisine-dies-at-82.html?_r=1|title=Roger Fessaguet, a Wizard of Haute Cuisine in New York, Dies at 82|work=New York Times|date=4 April 2014|author=Martin, Douglas|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Robert Meyzen retired and Fessaguet and André Jammet took over ownership of the restaurant.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; The following year, a ''New York Magazine'' article cited it as one of the best restaurants in New York City, and mentioned that most guidebooks gave it their highest rating.&lt;ref name="LLC1985"&gt;{{cite book|title=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7McBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA70|author=Platt, Adam|date=4 November 1985|publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=70|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fessaguet retired in 1988, leaving ownership with Jammet and his wife.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; The Jammets redecorated ''La Caravelle'' in 1990, replacing the original red carpets and banquettes with a color scheme of green and peach.  Artist Nina Duran was hired to create a smaller mural for the restaurant's foyer.&lt;ref name=murals/&gt;&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

Beginning in 2001, the Jammets started replacing many of the dishes ''La Caravelle'' was noted for with updated cuisine they described as more pleasing to the "contemporary palate". Some of the old favorite selections were relegated to a menu section labeled "Les Classiques", which became the minority of the offerings.&lt;ref name=mag&gt;{{cite book|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/food/reviews/restaurant/5282/|title=Class Act|author=Platt, Adam|work=New York Magazine|date=22 October 2001|publisher=New York Media, LLC|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple decided not to renew the restaurant's lease and it was closed in 2004.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Last night of business==

The customers who arrived on ''La Caravelle‍''{{'}}s last night of business were a mixture of regulars who had come for one last meal and bid farwell, as well as those who had never visited it before and wanted to see a piece of New York history before it was no more. Mr. and Mrs. Walter Cronkite dined with colleague [[Andy Rooney]] and his daughter; the Cronkites said they had been patrons of ''La Caravelle'' for 43 years. A couple came with their teenage daughter, who was so fussy about food, the ''La Caravelle'' chef would cook a packaged [[macaroni and cheese]] dinner for her.  Another family of three made reservations for four; one for the husband's mother who had been a ''La Caravelle'' regular and had died in 2000.&lt;ref name=NYTa&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/dining/for-the-faithful-a-final-quenelle.html|title=For the Faithful, a Final Quinelle|author=Witchel, Alex|date=26 May 2004|work=New York Times|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with no reservations managed to gain entrance to the restaurant's bar and were able to be seated at a table.  A young couple who had come to have a drink on ''La Caravelle''{{'}}s last night was graciously seated at the table which was formerly reserved for [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], who continued to patronize the restaurant after her marriage to [[Aristotle Onassis]].&lt;ref name=NYTa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2370917/onassis_at_la_caravelle/|title=$20,000,000 Honeymoon|author=Sparks, Fred|page=11|date=20 July 1971|work=Ironwood Daily Globe|accessdate=8 May 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering the restaurant's main room, a woman exclaimed that it was her best New York moment and she could now move to the suburbs. Though the restaurant never offered music or entertainment, the Jammets had arranged for [[Robert White (tenor)|Robert White]], a tenor and teacher at the [[Juilliard School]] to perform "[[Danny Boy]]". White was a patron of ''La Caravelle'' on the restaurant's first night of business in 1960.&lt;ref name=NYTa/&gt; It was awarded the [[James Beard Foundation]]'s Most Outstanding Restaurant in the Country award in the year of its closing.{{efn|Two other well-known New York French restaurants also closed in 2004: [[Lutèce (restaurant)|Lutèce]] and [[La Côte Basque]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name="LLC1985"/&gt;}}  The name is now known for champagnes produced by the Jammets; the restaurant began serving them as its house brand in 1997.&lt;ref name=Caravelle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lacaravelle.com/our-wines/#|title=Our Wines|publisher=La Caravelle|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/24/dining/sips-the-owner-of-la-caravelle-does-champage-his-way.html|title=SIPS; The Owner of La Caravelle Does Champagne His Way|work=New York Times|date=24 December 1997|author=Prial, Frank J.|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="563">'''''La règle de non-cumul''''' is a principle of [[French law]] which regulates whether an action should be brought under [[contract law]] (''la responsibilité civile'') or [[tort law]] (''la responsibilité delictuelle'').

It states that where there is a contract, an action can only be brought under contract law and when there is no contract an action can only be brought under tort law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5432">{{Spanish name|Sanz|Mancebo}}
'''Lorenzo Sanz Mancebo''' (born 9 August 1943 in [[Madrid]]) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[businessman]], former president of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid Club de Fútbol]] and former owner of [[Málaga CF|Málaga Club de Fútbol]], where his son [[Fernando Sanz|Fernando]] (a former player with Real Madrid and Málaga) served as the club's president.

== Early life ==
In his youth, Sanz played as a goalkeeper for several minor league Madrilenian teams, including [[Puerta Bonita]]. An astute businessman, he made his fortune in real estate and construction.

== Real Madrid President ==
Sanz was director of Real Madrid from 1985 to 1995. He became chairman of Real Madrid on 26 November 1995 after [[Ramón Mendoza]] was forced to resign due to the economic, social, and sporting problems of the club. Sanz tried to turn the club around by bringing in star players like [[Davor Šuker]] and [[Predrag Mijatović]] with his own money. This led to a long-awaited [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] victory, which Real Madrid had not won since 1966, as the club clinched both the 1998 and 2000 tournaments, now named the UEFA Champions League.

However, the two UEFA Champions League triumphs were not enough to hide the financial problems that still plagued the club and in elections a few weeks after the 2000 final, he lost the presidency to [[Florentino Pérez]].

== Negotiations with Parma ==
Between June 2005 and January 2006, Sanz was negotiating with [[Parma F.C.|Parma Football Club]] in ''Amministrazione Straordinaria'' to become the club's new owner. Guido Angiolini and Enrico Bondi, the two officers appointed by the Italian government to restore Parma, and its main sponsor [[Parmalat]], were the two persons involved in the operations with Sanz. The first time Parma announced negotiations with Sanz was in August 2005. Both President Guido Angiolini and government-appointed administrator Enrico Bondi asked for €27.5 million, but the negotiations were not as smooth as some predicted.  

Until January 2006, the Sanz family was still transacting business with Bondi and Angiolini, but to no avail. In an interview with ''[[Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' in January 2006, President Angiolini stated that, "If, by the 16th, the deal with the Sanz family has not been closed, we will set about finding a new buyer." Sanz has seemed the most likely buyer of the club since last August when he made an initial payment of €7.5 million ($9.07 million) on the full price of €27.5 million. However, he has not yet paid the outstanding €20 million. Parma administrators stated that after 16 January 2006, the club is free to find other interested buyers as the contract with Sanz expired on 15 January 2006. Other interested buyers include the owner of Spain's Alamak Espana Trade, [[Russian oligarch]] Abram Reznikov. The uncertainty over the club's future has become a source of increasing frustration for Parma supporters. The deal with Sanz was a big dilemma for Parma supporters. In some papers, this deal was referred to as "The never ending story." Parma supporters were longing for a positive ending. Sanz visited Parma a couple of times, and he even turned up at the [[Stadio Ennio Tardini]] to follow some of Parma's matches in [[Serie A]].  Because of his withdrawal from the deal and failure to pay the rest of the sum of €20.5 million, Lorenzo Sanz Senior and Lorenzo Sanz Junior lost much of their credibility.

== Later years ==
Sanz has recently announced that he will put himself up for election once again for the vacant President's position at Real Madrid, losing it to [[Ramón Calderón]].

On July 2006, Sanz purchased [[Málaga CF|Málaga Club de Fútbol]]. He sold the club in 2010 to a [[Qatar]]i investor.

In May 2008, it has been reported that he is looking to buy Italian club [[A.S. Bari|Associazione Sportiva Bari]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/index.php?action=read&amp;id=102108 TUTTO MERCATO WEB - Bari, Sanz interessato all'acquisto&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Bari owners have given him 10 days to close the deal, which is rumored to be around €15 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/index.php?action=read&amp;id=105398 TUTTO MERCATO WEB - Bari, ultimatum a Sanz&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2008, he was briefly jailed charged of fraud by a bank after trying to get paid a fake cheque. The complaint was withdrawn on December 2008.

On 11 November 2009, it was reported by Spanish newspaper ''El Pais'' that Sanz was arrested trying to smuggle [[work of art|artwork]] out of Spain.

== Family ==
Sanz is the father-in-law of former Real Madrid and Spanish defender [[Míchel Salgado]], who married his daughter Malula.

'''Mads Johansen Lange''', nicknamed the '''''King of Bali''''', (18 September 1807 in [[Rudkøbing]], Denmark{{snds}}13 May 1856 in [[Kuta]], [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]]) was a Danish trader, [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]], [[Peace makers|peace maker]] on Bali, knight of the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]], and recipient of the Danish gold medal of achievement. He was the son of Lorents Lange Pedersen{{efn|Some sources name him as Lorentz, with a 'z' instead of an 's'.}} and Maren Lange, a merchant and a merchant's daughter, respectively.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=20}}

Lange travelled to the [[Dutch East Indies]] at an early age and settled on the island of Bali. Here he built a thriving commercial enterprise, exporting rice, spices and beef, and importing weapons and textiles. He maintained good relations with the local [[Raja]]s and mediated between them and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonists with great success.

Lange died 48 years old, possibly because of poisoning. His business had been in decline by then, and even the joint efforts of his brother and nephew could not change this. The remains of the business were sold to a Chinese merchant. He had three children with local Balinese women. His daughter Cecilia married into [[Johor|Johore]] royalty and bore a son, [[Sultan Ibrahim of Johor|Ibrahim]], who became the [[Sultan of Johor]]. Lange is buried in Kotta (now '[[Kuta]]').

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===
Mads Lange was born in [[Rudkøbing]] on 18 September 1807, as the second son of Lorents Lange and Maren Hansen. He had one sister and ten brothers, three of whom were children from an earlier marriage of his mother. The youngest brother died when he was six years old. Little else is known about Mads' childhood.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=36}}

=== Ancestors ===
His father, Lorents Lange Pedersen, was the son of master builder Peder Frandsen Knudsøn and Johanne Margrethe Lorentzdatter Lange. He was the only one of his nine brothers and sisters to take his mother's surname, Lange, as his baptismal name. Although the idea was for it to be a middle name, in practice it became his surname, meaning his mother's surname lived on through him. Lorents was the only boy among the three children who survived into adulthood. In later life Lorents was a member of the [[Langeland]] militia. He had an indirect role in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]: Spanish soldiers were [[billet]]ed in his house from 1812 to 1813. He received 4{{nbsp}}florins a month for this, but it meant his family home was now occupied by about fifteen people. This was surely a contributing factor in his decision to buy a new house on the Østergade, No.{{nbsp}}12{{nsndns}}14, in 1816. In 1822 Lorents started a transport company with a mail coach and two horses, not uncommon for a merchant in those days. His cousin was master of the ferry services, which probably benefited the small company enormously. Lorents died in 1828.

Lange's mother, Maren Hansen, had married Mads Andresen in 1799. With him she had three sons. Mads Andresen died in 1805, and later that year Maren married Lorents Lange. She had inherited a tavern and a shop, which Lorents ran even though he had been trained to be a master builder. After Lorents' death she married Mads Hansen.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=20}}

== Career at sea ==
Lange started his career at sea at fourteen years of age. Three years later, in 1824, he worked aboard the ship ''North'', where he met [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] John Burd. They sailed together for many years, including to the Danish [[trading post]] [[Tranquebar]] in [[India]]. In 1833 they returned to Denmark, and Mads seized this opportunity to visit his parents' home. He remained in Denmark for some time and was counted in the 1834 [[census]].

In the meantime, Burd sold the ship ''North'' in [[Hamburg]]. A little while later he and Lange bought the ship ''South'', which they steered towards India and China. Burd was the captain and Lange the first mate. With them traveled Lange's three brothers: Hans, Carl Emil, and Hans Henrik, 20, 18, and 14 years old, respectively. None of the four brothers would ever return to Denmark.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=60}}

== Settlement in the East ==

=== Lombok ===
In 1835 Mads decided to settle on the island of [[Lombok]], east of Bali and [[Java]], because here there was a lively commercial traffic. The island contained two princely states, Karangasem Lombok and Mataram. The first was the largest, and it was the Raja from this state who allowed Lange to trade from the port city of Tanjungkarang, in exchange for a yearly fee. It was here that Lange created his first flourishing commercial enterprise. He exported coffee, rice, spices and green tobacco, importing textiles and weapons that could easily be sold to the local warring tribes.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=61}}

In 1839 fights erupted ever more frequently between the princely states. Combined with increased Dutch efforts to colonize the island, this forced Mads to leave Lombok. When the Raja who had supported him was defeated, Mads had to flee to Bali head-over-heels in his [[schooner]] ''Venus''.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=62}}

=== Bali ===
[[File:MJL faktori 01.png|thumb|Gate of the [[Factory (trading post)|''factorij'']], painting c.{{nbsp}}1845]]

Lange now had to start over on Bali. He settled on the south coast of the island, near the town of [[Kuta|Kotta]]. The town was situated on a narrow peninsula, which made it possible to load goods on the east and the west side. This came in very handy during the [[monsoon]] season, when winds abruptly changed direction.

Four factors helped Lange settle on Bali successfully. First was his long history of trading with Bali. This meant he knew the possibilities this island had to offer. Second were his good relations with the Balinese Rajas. Raja Kassiman of [[Badung]] had even invited him to settle on the island. This meant he enjoyed protection and could obtain cheap labour, but probably also that he possessed a monopoly on trade on the island. The third factor was that the local population on Bali was suffering from an economic depression, after a war with Java that had made the export of slaves impossible. The fourth factor was a shortage of rice in Asia. Bali was well situated to reap the benefits of this shortage because the island population was well skilled in rice farming, and because the climate was such that it allowed for up to three harvests a year.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=41}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=62}}

Lange built his [[Factory (trading post)|''factorij'']] at [[Kuta|Kotta]] and steadily expanded it with residential units and warehouses. The Dutch nobleman and politician [[Wolter Robert, Baron van Hoevell]] visited Bali and Mads Lange, and gave a description of the ''factorij'':{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=56}}

{{quote|quote=A large stone wall was the first thing that caught our eye. Through a large door or gate, which was locked at night, we rode into the estate. Opposite the gate stands a cannon with the mouth in the direction of the gate as a warning in case of enemy attacks. It proved that mister Lange did not blindly entrust his well-being to Raja of the country in which he was residing, and that vigilance and a gun in hand were better to rely on.

Inside this wall are the buildings that form mister Lange's house (…). Here beauty is sacrificed for usefulness. The central building consists of several good guest rooms which, as I was told, left nothing to be desired.

In the foreground ones gaze is drawn towards a large Pandopo which is used for receiving Balinese come to talk about trade. There is almost never any place for visitors. You could describe it as a [[stock exchange]] which never closes. There are also a special dining room and a billiards room, which are very well equipped, and in which the generous host made sure his guests were wanting nothing.

Next to the main building are several houses for the staff and very good, spacious warehouses. Even in this there was an intense and uninterrupted bustle. Continuously rice was being brought in by the Balinese, in exchange for cash or other goods they came to acquire. Through the creative force of mister Lange, a sort of colony has steadily grown within those walls, a lively and densly occupied city, which possesses order, dynamism and prosperity.|source=''Van Hoëvell''}}

[[File:MJL faktori 02.png|thumb|[[Factory (trading post)|''Factorij'']], with Mads Lange in the back in the middle. Painting, c.{{nbsp}}1845]]

Lange was in good standing with the Balinese, and within a few years he had built a flourishing company with about fifteen ships, plying lively trade among ports in the East Indies, the West Indies, and Europe. His brothers helped him out in the [[Factory (trading post)|''factorij'']], and sometimes sailed on the ships when trading missions were difficult or demanding. Pirates and bad weather conditions often made these journeys dangerous. Two of Lange's brothers, Hans Henrik and Carl Emil, died during these kinds of journeys, the latter dying in plain sight of Mads when the rowboat he was in [[capsizing|capsized]].{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=48}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=37}}

Lange's career as a merchant blossomed during the 1840s. Halfway through that period his fleet of ships was capable of transporting between 800 and 1500 tons of freight. Many of the ships were newly built, probably in [[Singapore]], a city Mads often visited. [[Coconut oil]] was sold in Singapore in great quantities, yielding profits of 200 to 300%. Because of this, Mads had an oil mill imported entire from Europe. This was an expensive operation, but the costs were recuperated within a few years. Rice kept being announced for low prices in the newspapers of Singapore, Australia and China.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=69}}{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=128}}

From 1841 to 1843 Lange had an intimate relationship with his second cousin Malana von Munk, who was a distant relative of [[Christian IX of Denmark]]. While the relationship was strong and there are writings describing Lange's infatuation with von Munk, she had to return to Denmark due to personal reasons, bringing the two-year relationship to an end.

Predominantly French ships sailed to Kotta to load trading goods, especially cattle, ponies, pigs and poultry. Often the Balinese would come to the beaches with far more livestock than the ships could carry. Lange took advantage of the situation. He bought the livestock that remained, especially the cattle, since beef was a popular food. He functioned as a beach butcher, where a man could have his cows butchered quickly. [[Dendeng|Dried beef, known as "ding-ding]]", was shipped to Dutch troops on Java.{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=26}}{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=85}}

During those days, Lange's [[Factory (trading post)|''factorij'']] had trading interests of a million guilders in trade with Java specifically. His success was primarily due to his ability to create personal ties, especially with the local Rajas. The Dutch, who were also trying to set up trade on Bali, were less successful, and in May 1844 they named Lange their agent on the island, with the right to fly the Dutch flag. Now Mads was not just working for himself, but also for the Dutch authorities who profited from his cooperation.

=== Peace broker ===
In the last half of the 1840s, the Dutch again tried to gain control over Bali and its Rajas. In July 1846 they sent a military force to the island, the [[Dutch intervention in Northern Bali (1846)|First Dutch Expedition to Bali]]. Their goal was the northern city of [[Buleleng]]. After an ultimatum to surrender unconditionally was rejected, the Dutch landed on the island on 28{{nbsp}}June and attacked the city. It was conquered and burned. The next day the Dutch troops marched for the [[Residency (country subdivision)|residency]] of [[Singaraja]], where this city was taken without much resistance ase most Balinese were moving inland to the fort of Djagaraga. During the attack, the Dutch received support from their fleet, whose commander would not allow the troops to move too far inland. Lange offered to go to the Rajas of Buleleng and [[Karangasem Regency|Karangasem]] for negotiations. These were successful and on 9{{nbsp}}July the peace accords came into effect. The Rajas would pay a small amount of damages, and the Dutch would maintain a small occupation force on the island until the matter could be settled.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=69}}

When the Rajas did not comply with all the agreements of the treaty of 1846, the Dutch sent a larger expedition to Bali in 1848, the [[Dutch intervention in Northern Bali (1848)|Second Dutch Expedition to Bali]]. Lange was able to keep the states of [[Tabanan]] and Badung neutral, but the rest of the Balinese forces assembled at Djagaraga, the same place they had sought refuge in 1846. During the preparations for their campaign, the Dutch blockaded the coast of Bali, wreaking havoc on trade. Djagaraga lay deep inland, so the attack had to go through without the help of the fleet. At first all went well, but the Dutch were stopped when they met Gusti Djilantiek, who had dug in with 600 riflemen. When it became clear that the Dutch supply was badly organized, because there were not enough [[coolie]]s to carry everything, the Dutch could no longer resist Balinese attacks from the villages and were forced to retreat.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=101}}

The Dutch defeat resonated through the Dutch East Indies and the government felt compelled to re-establish authority in order to prevent revolts in other parts of the archipelago. A new force twice the size of the previous one was sent in 1849, the [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1849)|Third Dutch Expedition to Bali]]. This time, the army brought along 200 coolies to carry supplies and the wounded. On 1{{nbsp}}April 1849 the fleet reached Buleleng and on 4{{nbsp}}April general-major [[Andreas Victor Michiels]] set up his headquarters in the abandoned palace of Singaraja. Emissaries of the Rajas of Buleleng and Karangasem were sent to the general, but he refused to talk to anyone but the Rajas themselves. He urged them to hurry up, or they would lose their territories. The meeting took place on 7{{nbsp}}April. The Balinese arrived at the palace with a force of 12,000 men, after the Dutch had allowed them to take as many guards as the Rajas deemed necessary. Fighting did not occur, since the Rajas accepted all demands of the Dutch, including the immediate demolition of the fortifications at Djagaraga.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=109}}

[[File:Puputan of the Raja of Boeleleng.jpg|thumb|left|Raja of Buleleng commits [[Puputan]] together with his subjects, from ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]''.{{efn|In reality the Raja escaped alive.}}]]

The Dutch now decided to focus their attention on the south of Bali, and they attacked the small states of Karangasem and [[Klungkung]]. At the same time, they accepted an offer of 400 soldiers from the Prince of Lombok, who also coveted power over Karangasem. On 12{{nbsp}}May 1849 preparations were complete, and the Dutch landed near the coastal town of Padang Cove, which they overtook. A week later, warriors from Lombok infiltrated in Karangasem, which rose in revolt against its Raja. The Raja, facing total defeat, [[Puputan|killed all his wives and children and then committed suicide]]. The Raja of Buleleng, together with Gusti Djilantiek, fled into the mountains, with the warriors from Lombok in pursuit. The Dutch now focussed their attacks on Klungkung, where the most important and holiest Raja of Bali resided, the [[Dewa Agung]]. This Raja and his sister were the most fanatical opponents of Dutch influence on Bali, and it was of utmost importance to sideline them. Under command of major-general Michiels, the Dutch advanced and took control of an old, holy temple and the town of Kasumba. The next night, however, they were attacked by the Balinese, and Michiels was wounded in the thigh. He died after an unsuccessful amputation. The second in command, lieutenant-colonel Jan van{{nbsp}}Swieten, took over command and decided to retreat to the coast. There he waited for further instructions from [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. They were met by the warriors from Lombok, who informed them that the Raja and Gusti Djilantiek were no longer alive.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=113}}

[[File:Aanval der Baliers bij Kasoemba.jpg|thumb|Balinese attack the Dutch at Kasumba]]

Lange's trade suffered from the war, and when the Raja of Kassim launched an attack on neighbouring Mengwi, the people in Kotta feared a counter-attack. Mads convinced the Rajas to assemble a force of 16,000 men and join him on a journey to the Dewa Agung, to plead with him to conduct peace negotiations with the Dutch. Even though fortune favoured the Balinese after the death of Michiels and the retreat of the Dutch army, the Rajas decided to accept Lange's request. Lange had placed a man aboard his ship ''Venus'' and sent him ahead to inform the Dutch of his mediation. They were not convinced he would succeed, and when the monsoon season arrived, they decided that action needed to be taken lest the whole expedition fail. The army advanced on Kasumba and met almost no resistance. The Balinese had raised their defences around Klungkung. Early in the morning of 10{{nbsp}}June, the Dutch left Kasumba for Klungkung. Along the way, they met Lange and a small group of riders. He informed them that his mediation had failed, but that the Rajas wished for peace. Mads also warned the Dutch not to advance any farther, for he could not guarantee that his 16,000 men would not join the Balinese defences. The Dutch were grateful for the information and retreated. They sent Lange back to the Rajas, together with a Dutch officer, to agree with the Rajas that the Balinese would send an embassy to the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] to recognize Dutch sovereignty over the island.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=115}}

A few days after the new commander of the military forces in the Dutch East Indies, [[Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1792–1862)|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], had arrived, Lange organised a meeting for all Dutch soldiers and 12,000 Balinese. The latter were extremely curious about this 'real' European prince. The Rajas and the prince assured each other of their peaceful intentions, after which the prince left for Batavia, taking most of the Dutch troops with him. Jan van{{nbsp}}Swieten was tasked with forging a final peace agreement with the Balinese princes. When the residences of the Rajas proved to be too small for the meetings, talks were held in Lange's ''factorij'', which by that time was already a meeting place where quarrels between Balinese and foreigners were resolved. The meeting took place from 10 to 15{{nbsp}}July. The Dewa Agung was ill and had sent his son Raja Geit Putera from Klungkung. The Rajas of Bandung, Tabanan, [[Gianyar Regency|Gianyar]] and Mengwi were also present. Both parties saw the final arrangement as a victory. The Dutch left the island as sovereigns, and the Balinese would remain de facto independent for the rest of the 19th century.{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=32}}

According to estimates, around 20,000 people attended the meetings, mostly Balinese. During the many days of negotiations, they all stayed in or around Lange's ''factorij''. This must have been a huge drain on his resources. Raja Kassiman rewarded him for his efforts by granting him the honorary title of ''unggawa besar'' or ''high commissioner'', one of the most senior titles on Bali. The Dutch for their part rewarded Lange with the Knight's Cross in the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]], awarded on 11{{nbsp}}December 1849 by King [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]]. The newspaper of Langeland, the Danish island where Lange had been born, wrote in 1850 about the award:

{{quote|quote=His many great services and self-sacrificing toils in support of the Dutch, have finally been acknowledged by the Dutch government, both in the East Indies as well as in Europe, proven by the fact that last year he was named Knight in the Order of the Dutch Lion.{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=32}}{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=117}}}}

=== Economic decline ===
After the war Bali suffered an economic decline, which also affected Lange and his business. The Dutch blockades during the military campaigns had practically stopped all trade. Also the majority of the male inhabitants had fought in the war instead of working  the fields, leading to a standstill in the production of major export products. Lange was able to buy rice in Lombok and sell it to Raja Kassiman, but his expensive oil mill ground to a halt due to a shortage of coconuts.

At the same time as this drop in production, the number of ships in the waters around Bali dropped sharply. As skippers were not able to match their previous profits, their numbers declined. Sailing ship were out-competed by steamers, resulting in more traffic for large ports like Hong Kong and Singapore, and less for smaller places. Lange also suffered from illness, and a never-sent letter to the Raja of Tabanan shows he had plans to return to Rudkøbing.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=64}}{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=127}}

== Relationship with Denmark ==
Lange had never forgotten his fatherland even though he had lived on Bali for most of his life. He sent several artefacts to the Royal Ethnographic Museum in Copenhagen, which was opened in 1849 by [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen]]. After Lange's death, his sea chest was offered to the museum by a Swedish engineer who had acquired it on Bali. On 28{{nbsp}}July 1854 the many gifts Lange had donated to the museum resulted in his being awarded the Danish [[Medal of Merit (Denmark)|Golden Medal of Merit]] by [[Frederik VII of Denmark]]. Papers in the Danish National Archives show the bureaucratic process surrounding this award:

{{quote|quote=Mads Lange was awarded the golden medal by [[Royal Order]] of 28{{nbsp}}July 1854 resulting from a proposal by the Ministry for Culture. The initiative for this recognition of merit was taken by Christian Jürgensen Thomasen, who on 7th{{nbsp}}march sent a letter to the director of the Royal Gallery, nominating Mads Lange for donating valuable artifacts to the Ethnographic Museum. On the 11th{{nbsp}}may the director sent the proposal on to the Ministry for Culture, which lent its approval on 24{{nbsp}}July, after which it was signed by Frederik{{nbsp}}VII on 28{{nbsp}}July.{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=33}}}}

Lange's contribution did not confine itself to the cultural sphere. He sent thousands of [[Dutch rijksdaalder|rijksdaalders]] to Denmark during the [[First Schleswig War|First Danish-German War]] of 1848–1851. He also collected money for the Danish organisation Aid for the Victims of War.

== Death ==

Lange died on 13 May 1856, 48 years of age. His daughter Cecilia was only eight years old, but, like Lange's English physician, she suspected he had been poisoned during a visit to a Raja. There were also rumors he had been poisoned by the Dutch. Since no official inquiry has ever been made, it is impossible either to prove or to disprove any of those theories.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2007|p=65}}

In talks with writer Aage Krarup Nielsen, Cecilia accused Lange's nephew Peter Christian Lange of stealing everything Lange had of value and fleeing. According to Nielsen, she said, "He was a robber who left for home in Denmark with all that was left of my fathers riches, without leaving us two children a single penny."{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=54}} [[Ludvig Verner Helms]] defended this nephew, based on a letter he had received in 1883 from one of Hans Nielsen Lange's sons, who wrote about Peter Christian Lange: "He sold everything that had belonged to my father, ships and buildings, nothing was left for me. The house in [[Banjuwangi]] was left to Cecilia, but because she had no documentary evidence that she was Lange's daughter, the government would not allow this."{{efn|It was believed that Cecilia would inherit the house on Java, but the government denied this.}}{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=55}}

=== Testament ===
Lange had drawn up a will in 1851. Krarup Nielsen received a copy of this will from his daughter Cecilia during one of her visits. It is highly likely that this copy still rests at the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Royal Library in Copenhagen]].

The reason why Lange had made a will at such a young age was the declining economic situation of his company. His planned trip to Denmark was also part of the decision. His brother had recently died in an accident, and making a will before undertaking a long and dangerous journey would have seemed like a good idea. A short while before writing the will Mads had lost his lover, the Balinese woman Nyai Kenyèr, probably because of an outbreak of [[cholera]].

According to the will, each of his children received a [[Will and testament#Terminology|legacy]] of 10,000 [[Dutch guilder|guilders]]. Besides this, Cecilia would inherit all belongings and properties on Java, on the condition that her mother would be allowed to use these properties for the rest of her life. Cecilia's mother would inherit 3,000 pieces of gold, the interest on which would make her financially secure. Ida Bay, Lange's cousin, would inherit 4,000 gold pieces and 1,000 [[Spanish dollar|Spanish dollars]], but she had to support Lange's mother, who would inherit all remaining assets. Lastly, two nephews, one in Rudkøbing and one on Bali, would each inherit 1,000 guilders. Around 1855, Mads changed his will: the first change was removing the name of his son William Peters due to his death in Singapore. The second change was the reduction of the legacy of his other son Andreas Emil to 5,000 guilders, and that Andreas would now inherit all his father's personal belongings and succeed him as head of the company. Cecilia's legacy was reduced by 25% and was frozen at a 9% interest rate. The funds would not be released until she married or reached adulthood.{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=61}}{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=140}}

=== Grave ===

Lange was buried near his ''factorij'' in a small grove of palm trees. Today the grave lies on the main road between Sanur and Kotta. An [[obelisk]] on a white base was erected in 1927 by the Dutch government, at the urging of the Danish consul at [[Surabaya]], Johan Ernst Quintus Bosz.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== The end of the business ===
Lange's brother Hans and his nephew Peter Christian tried to keep the ''factorij'' going after his death. The nephew even invested a large amount of his personal wealth. After Hans' death in 1860, Peter Christian was the only remaining Christian member of the family on Bali. After Raja Kassiman died in 1863, the ''factorij'' lost its protector. A short time later, Peter found himself in conflict with the Rajas. He subsequently sold the business to a Chinese merchant. He died in 1869 in Denmark at the age of 42.

Several times Cecilia and her half-brother tried in vain to get clear information about the value of their father's belongings on Bali. An investigation by the Dutch authorities in 1872 resulted in several lengthy exchanges of letters between the Raja and the Dutch. In the meantime, the once-flourishing company withered away. The empty ''factorij'' was abandoned and today no visible traces remain of its existence.

== Descendants ==
[[File:CLange.jpg|thumb|Cecilia Catharina, Mads Lange's daughter]]
Mads Lange never married. His whole life he hoped to marry his cousin Ida Bay, who was ten years younger than him. He sent her letters and gifts, but the feeling was clearly not mutual, and she did not even comment on the letter containing the marriage proposal from the east.

On Bali, Lange fathered three children with two women. One was a Balinese woman named Njai Kenjèr or Nyai Kenyèr.{{efn|The spelling is uncertain. Her name appears in one letter only, which she wrote to Mads Lange from Tabanan.}} His second wife was a Chinese woman who Mads called ''Nonna Sangnio'', which means ''"Miss"'' or ''"Mistress"''.

He had three children in total. With Nyai Kenyèr he had William Peter (1843) and Andreas Emil (1850), and with Nonna Sangnio he had Cecilia Catharina (1848). Both his sons went to school in Singapore. William Peter died here{{clarify|date=February 2017}}&lt;!--Where?--&gt; at twelve years of age. Andreas Emil was educated at the [[Raffles Institution (Secondary)|Raffles Institute]], married an Asian woman, had several children, and was Private Secretary to the [[Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak|Rajah of Sarawak]] for at least eighteen years, during which time he had six sons and two daughters between 1881 and 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://byarkivet.langelandkommune.dk/Dengodehistorie/Madslange/Gammel%20stamtavle|title=The old Mads Lange Familytree - Rudkøbing Byhistoriske Arkiv|last=|first=|date=|website=byarkivet.langelandkommune.dk|publisher=|language=da|access-date=3 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074901/http://byarkivet.langelandkommune.dk/Dengodehistorie/Madslange/Gammel%20stamtavle|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andreas's descendants live in Singapore and Australia.

Cecilia Catharina was sent to Singapore when she was seven years old to receive an education at a convent school. When Lange died the next year, she was adopted by an English family who took her on holidays to Europe and India. She received a thorough education, which proved to be of great use when she returned to Singapore in 1870. Here she met [[Abu Bakar of Johor|Abu Bakar]], who was the ruler of [[Johor]] at the time. He fell in love with her and was so smitten he ignored all the customary stereotypes that in those days stood in the way of a marriage between a full-blooded Malay man and a Eurasian woman. They eventually married, and Cecilia took the name ''Zubaidah''. She was not Abu Bakar's first wife, however, and when her husband became [[sultan]] in 1885 with the blessings of the British, it was his third wife Fatima who received the title of [[sultana (title)|sultana]]. Cecilia was named ''"Inche Besar Zubaidah"'', a title bestowed upon wives of the sultan who were not sultana. But in contrast to his other wives, it was Cecilia who bore him a son and continued the dynasty. Her son [[Ibrahim of Johor|Ibrahim]] is a descendant of Lange, and his family sits on the throne of Johor to this very day.{{sfn|Nielsen|1949|p=134}}

== Notes ==
Former New Zealand prime minister [[David Lange]], who is known to be of Danish ancestry, is descended from a different branch of the family, according to himself.{{sfn|Andresen|1992|p=43}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8290">A '''MEPS (Minimum Energy Performance Standard)''' is a specification, containing a number of performance requirements for an [[energy]]-using device, that effectively limits the maximum amount of energy that may be consumed by a product in performing a specified task.

A MEPS is usually made mandatory by a government energy efficiency body. It may include requirements not directly related to energy; this is to ensure that general performance and user satisfaction are not adversely affected by increasing energy efficiency.

A MEPS generally requires use of a particular test procedure that specifies how performance is measured.

In [[North America]] when addressing energy efficiency, a MEPS is sometimes referred to simply as a “standard”, as in “Co-operation on [[Collaborative Labeling and Appliance Standards Program (CLASP)|Labeling and Standards Programs]]”.  In [[Latin America]] when addressing energy efficiency, MEPS are sometimes referred to as ''Normas'' (translated as "norms").

==Examples==
* A [[refrigerator|refrigerating appliance]] is required to maintain [[temperature]]s inside its compartments within specified limits, and to operate (including defrosting) in a specified ambient temperature while using at most a specified amount of [[electricity]]; the energy use allowed varies according to volume, number of doors, the function of the various compartments and other parameters.  This graph shows the dramatic reduction in electricity use in U.S. refrigerators following the introduction of a series of first California then U.S. MEPS starting in the mid-1970s:

[[Image:kwh per frig.jpg|thumb|frame|right|Price, volume and efficiency of refrigerators]]
* An [[electric fan]] is required to shift air at a specified rate while consuming a limited amount of power.
A storage [[water heater]] providing hot water for sanitary purposes is required to heat up a specified quantity of water to a specified temperature and store it at that temperature for a specified time while consuming a limited amount of energy.  In this example, the requirements for heating up and for maintaining the temperature may be applied as two separate energy performance requirements or there may be a single task efficiency. 
* An electric [[induction motor]] is required to have a specified minimum full-load efficiency.
A [[compact fluorescent lamp]] is required to start and run up to near full [[brightness]] in a given time, to have a minimum life of several thousand hours, to maintain its output within specified limits, to withstand a certain number of switchings, to have a consistent colour appearance and a specified colour rendering.  Its energy performance requirement is usually stated in terms of minimum efficacy (light output per electrical input).

==California==
In the U.S., the state of [[California]] was a pioneer &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eceee.org S. Nadel S., 2003, Appliance &amp; equipment efficiency standards in the US: Accomplishments,next steps and lessons learned, ECEEE 2003 Summer Study, St Raphael.&lt;/ref&gt; in the introduction of MEPS. In order to reduce the growth in electricity use, the [[California Energy Commission]] (CEC)  was given unique and strong authority to regulate the efficiency of appliances sold in the state.  It started to adopt appliance efficiency regulations in 1978, and has updated the standards regularly over time, and expanded the list of covered appliances. 

In 1988, California's standards became national standards for the U.S. through the enactment of the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] (NAECA).  The federal standards preempted state standards (unless the state justified a waiver from federal preemption based on conditions in the state), and since then, the U.S. Department of Energy has had the responsibility to update the federal standards. 

California has continued to expand the list of appliances it regulates for appliances that are not federally regulated, and therefore not preempted.  In recent years,{{When|date=April 2014}} the CEC's attention has been focused on consumer electronics, for which energy use has been growing dramatically.

==Australia==
MEPS programs are made mandatory in [[Australia]] by state government legislation and regulations which give force to the relevant Australian Standards. It is mandatory for the following products manufactured in or imported into Australia to meet the MEPS levels specified by the relevant Australian Standards:

November 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; MEPS have been set for three-phase electric motors and [[compact fluorescent lamps]].

==New Zealand==
On 5 February 2002, [[New Zealand]] introduced Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) with Energy Efficiency Regulations.
MEPS and energy rating labels help improve the energy efficiency of our{{Who|date=April 2014}} products, and enable consumers to choose products that use less energy.  Products covered by MEPS must meet or exceed set levels for energy performance before they can be sold to consumers.
MEPS have been updated over the years (2002, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2011) to cover a wide range of products, and increasing levels of stringency. [[New Zealand]] works with Australia to harmonise MEPS levels. Almost all of its standards are joint standards with Australia.
New Zealand has mandatory Energy rating labelling for dishwashers and clothes dryers, fridges, washing machines and room air conditioners. 
MEPS apply to the following:&lt;ref&gt;Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority of New Zealand http://www.eeca.govt.nz/standards-and-ratings/minimum-energy-performance-standards-and-labelling&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Montague Chamberlain''' (April 5, 1844 – February 10, 1924) was a Canadian-American businessman, [[natural history|naturalist]], and [[ethnographer]].

==Biography==
Chamberlain was born in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|St. John]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]]. He spent the first few decades of his life as a bookkeeper and later manager of a grocery company in St. John. In his mid-twenties, he also became a dedicated amateur ornithologist. In 1883 he co-founded the [[American Ornithologists' Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The American Ornithologists' Union | journal = Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club | volume = VIII | issue = 4 | pages = 221–226 |date=October 1883}}&lt;/ref&gt; which today stakes its claim as "the oldest and largest organization in the New World devoted to the scientific study of birds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aou.org/ |title=The American Ornithologists' Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888 Chamberlain became a resident member and editor for the [[Nuttall Ornithological Club]], and a founding member of the [[American Ornithologists' Union]]. After quitting the grocery business, he became the assistant secretary of the [[Harvard Corporation]] in 1889 and the secretary of the [[Lawrence Scientific School]] in 1893.

Chamberlain was married at the age of 63, to Anna Sartoris Prout of [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. Their marriage lasted six years before Anna died.

Chamberlain died in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]], in 1924. The same year, [[Theodore Sherman Palmer]], secretary of the American Ornithologists' Union, wrote an obituary of Chamberlain in ''[[The Auk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/414|volume= 41|issue= 4|date=October 1924|pages=643–649|journal=The Auk|title=Notes and News|doi=10.2307/4074297}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Percy Algernon Taverner]] later published an obituary of Chamberlain in ''[[Canadian Field-Naturalist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume= 39|pages= 20 |year=1925|author=Percy Algernon Taverner|journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist|url=https://archive.org/details/canadianfieldnat1925otta|title=In Memoriam — Montague Chamberlain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer's obituary includes a lament that Chamberlain made no direct contributions to ornithology during the last twenty years of his life.

==Writings==
He was a frequent contributor to ''The Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club'', ''[[The Auk]]'' (of which he was also a founding associate editor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Literary gossip|journal=The Week : a Canadian journal of politics, literature, science and arts|date=6 Mar 1884|volume=1|issue=14|page=222|url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n112/mode/1up|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), and ''Bulletin of the Natural History Society of New Brunswick'', the last of which published his ''A Catalogue of the Birds of New Brunswick: With brief notes relating to their migrations, breeding, relative abundance, etc.'' in 1882. He also authored the following books:

*''A Catalogue of Canadian Birds'', 1887
*''Birds of Greenland'', 1889
*''The Church Army'', Damrell and Upham, 1897
*''Maliseet Vocabulary'', [[Harvard Cooperative Society]], 1899
*''The Penobscot Indians'', 1899

Chamberlain's interest in the [[North American Indians|Native Americans]] grew after spending time at the [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]] haven of [[Penobscot Indian Island Reservation|Indian Island]] in [[Maine]], where he helped start a museum. He maintained that a Penobscot had saved his grandfather's life. Chamberlain also became familiar with the nearby and related [[Passamaquoddy]] and [[Maliseet]], leading to his drafting of the first significant English-Maliseet dictionary. Although Maliseet is still spoken today by around 1,500 people, ''Maliseet Vocabulary'' has become a valuable source on the Maliseet language, as the first published, substantial characterization of the language, recorded at a relatively early date. The book includes translations for about 1,600 Maliseet words; perhaps owing in part to Chamberlain's particular interests as a naturalist and [[bird]] enthusiast, 481 of the 1,600 words are related to [[plants]] and [[animal]]s, including 124 Maliseet words for different types of birds.

'''Myra Hiatt Kraft''' (''née'' '''Myra Nathalie Hiatt'''; December 27, 1942 – July 20, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonindicators.org/IndicatorsProject/PublicSafety/Content.aspx?id=838|title=Myra H. Kraft|work=The Boston Indicators Project|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American philanthropist and the wife of [[New England Patriots]] and [[New England Revolution]] owner [[Robert Kraft]].

==Early life and education==
Kraft was born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in 1942, the daughter of Frances and [[Jacob Hiatt]]. Her father was a [[Lithuanian Jewish]] immigrant who had served as a circuit judge of the Court of Lithuania before immigrating in 1935.&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;[http://espn.go.com/boston/nfl/story/_/id/6786343/myra-kraft-wife-new-england-patriots-new-england-revolution-owner-dies ESPN: "Philanthropist Myra Kraft dies"] July 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HolyCross /&gt;&lt;ref name=JewishJournal /&gt; His parents and three other members of his family died during the [[Holocaust]]. He went on to become a well known philanthropist and leader in the Jewish community.&lt;ref name=HolyCross&gt;[http://www.holycross.edu/departments/publicaffairs/hcm/spring01/in_memoriam/mem-spr01-hiatt.html College of the Holy Cross: In Memoriam: Jacob Hiatt] February 25, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob served as president of the E.F. Dodge Paper Box Corp. in [[Leominster, Massachusetts]] and remained president when it merged with 12 other box and printing companies to become the Rand-Whitney Corp.&lt;ref name=HolyCross /&gt; Rand-Whitney was bought by his son-in-law, Robert Kraft, in 1972.

In 1960, Kraft graduated from the private [[Bancroft School]] in Worcester,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Red|first=Christian|title=New England Patriots have someone watching over them during Super Bowl journey|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/england-patriots-watching-super-bowl-journey-article-1.1013461|work=NY Daily News|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1964 she graduated from [[Brandeis University]] with a degree in History.&lt;ref name="BRANDEIS2012"/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Kraft was listed by ''Boston Magazine'' as one of the 20 Most Powerful Women in Boston,&lt;ref name="Ch5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebostonchannel.com/entertainment/2163818/detail.html|title=Boston Magazine's Most Powerful Women|work=[[Boston magazine]]|publisher=[[WCVB-TV]].com|date=2003-04-30|accessdate=2008-03-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225080035/http://www.thebostonchannel.com/entertainment/2163818/detail.html|archivedate=2008-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was president and director of the  New England Patriots Charitable Foundation and trustee of the Robert K. and Myra H. Kraft Foundation. She served on the boards of directors of the [[American Repertory Theatre]], the [[United Way of America|United Way]] of Massachusetts Bay, Northeastern University, the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club]]s of Boston, and [[Brandeis University]].&lt;ref name="Ch5" /&gt; She and her husband donated millions of dollars to promote American football in Israel building the [[Kraft Stadium]] in Jerusalem&lt;ref name="Ch5" /&gt; and founding the [[Israeli Football League]]. In addition, Kraft helped to support and fund the Israeli Women’s National Flag Football Team.&lt;ref name=JewishJournal&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/sports/article/bob_kraft_new_england_patriots_jewish_owner_20120123 Jewish Journal: "Bob Kraft: New England Patriots’ Jewish owner" by Andrew Gershman] January 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraft and her husband started the "Passport to Israel" Program with the Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Boston which provided financial assistance to Jewish parents to send their children to Israel while teenagers to help promote Jewish identity.&lt;ref name=JewishJournal /&gt; To encourage greater understanding between [[Christians]] and [[Jews]], Kraft, her husband, and her father endowed two professorships in comparative religion at the [[College of the Holy Cross]] and [[Brandeis University]]: the Kraft-Hiatt Chair in Judaic Studies at Holy Cross and the Kraft-Hiatt Chair in Christian Studies at Brandeis University.&lt;ref name=HolyCross /&gt;

The ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' credited Kraft with "modeling a new form of engaged giving that is transforming the relationship between philanthropist and philanthropy,"&lt;ref name="Paulson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2007/03/18/giving_large|title=Giving Large|work=[[The Boston Globe]] Magazine|first=Michael|last=Paulson|date=2007-03-18|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' stated she was "forging a whole new form of engaged giving."&lt;ref name="Paulson" /&gt; The Krafts have donated more than $100 million to a wide range of charities mostly focusing on education, athletics, women’s issues, and Israel.&lt;ref name=JewishJournal /&gt;

==New England Patriots==
Kraft was the president of the New England Patriots Charitable Foundation, the team's non-profit entity created by the Kraft family to support charitable and philanthropic agencies throughout New England. Through her work with the Patriots Charitable Foundation, Kraft became known as the matriarch of the franchise, providing leadership by her example of volunteerism and helping others in need.

Shortly after the [[1996 NFL Draft]], Kraft learned that the Patriots' fifth-round choice, [[Christian Peter]] of [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]], had a lengthy history of [[violence against women]]. At her insistence, coupled by backlash from women's groups and Patriots fans against Peter's signing, the Patriots relinquished Peter's rights only a week after the draft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/articles/2004/06/16/a_voice_for_the_victims "A voice for the victims"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Kraft married [[Robert Kraft]] in June 1963 while she was a student at Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifpcorp.com/index.cfm?ac=NewsDetails&amp;ID=148 International Forest Products LLC website: "Giving Large"] March 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They have four sons: 
*[[Jonathan Kraft|Jonathan A. Kraft]] is president of [[The Kraft Group]] and the [[New England Patriots]].
*Daniel A. Kraft is president of [[International Forest Products]] founded in 1972 by his father.
*Joshua Kraft is president and CEO of the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys &amp; Girls Clubs]] of Boston.

Kraft was a member of Temple Emanuel in [[Newton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=JewishJournal /&gt;

==Death==
Kraft died from cancer on July 20, 2011, at age 68, in her [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] home.&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2011/07/21/myra_kraft_paragon_of_giving_dies/|title=Myra Kraft, philanthropist and wife of New England Pats owner Robert Kraft, dead at 68|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|first=Bryan|last=Marquard|date=2011-07-20|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public services were held at Temple Emanuel in [[Newton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=ESPN /&gt; In her memory, all Patriots players wore a patch on their uniforms bearing Kraft's initials (MHK) throughout the 2011–12 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d826399bf/article/pats-season-dedicated-to-myra-kraft-continues-to-super-bowl NFL.com: "Pats' season, dedicated to Kraft, continues to Super Bowl"]  January 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Overseas Investment Amendment Act 2018''' is a bill that amends the [[Overseas Investment Act 2005]] to ban most non-resident foreigners from buying existing houses&lt;ref name="NZ Parliament" /&gt;, by classifying them as sensitive land and introducing a residency test. Australian citizens are exempt from this rule as they are considered New Zealand residents per the [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]]. Singaporean citizens are also exempt due to free trade rules.&lt;ref name="Stuff"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Long |first1=Jessica |title=Labour's bill to curb foreigners buying New Zealand homes becomes law |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/property/106297829/labours-bill-to-curb-foreigners-buying-new-zealand-houses-becomes-law |accessdate=16 August 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Selby-Gren |first1=Michael |title=New Zealand has banned foreigners from buying homes in the country|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/new-zealand-bans-foreigners-buying-homes-peter-thiel-2018-8?r=US&amp;IR=T |accessdate=16 August 2018 |publisher=[[Business Insider]] Australia |date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"&gt;{{cite news |title=New Zealand rolls out ban on foreign national property purchases |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/08/zealand-rolls-ban-foreign-national-property-purchases-180815184516994.html |accessdate=16 August 2018 |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news |title=New Zealand passes ban on foreign home buyers into law |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-newzealand-politics-housing/new-zealand-passes-ban-on-foreign-homebuyers-into-law-idUSKBN1L00KO |accessdate=17 August 2018 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Overseas Investment Amendment Act was supported by the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour&amp;ndash;led coalition government]] but was opposed by the opposition centre-right [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and libertarian [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] parties. It passed its third reading on 15 August 2018 and received royal assent on 22 August.&lt;ref name="NZ Parliament" /&gt;

==Legislative features==
The Overseas Investment Amendment Act 2018 amends the Overseas Investment Act 2005 to ensure that investments made by foreign persons benefit New Zealand. The Act would also enhance the information-gathering and enforcement powers of the [[Overseas Investment Office]], which is responsible for administering the Act.&lt;ref name="Bill Digest"&gt;{{cite web |title=Overseas Investment Amendment Bill 2017 (5-3) (Hon David Parker) |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-digests/document/52PLLaw25571/overseas-investment-amendment-bill-2017-bills-digest-2557 |publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]] |accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Act amends the definition of "ordinarily resident in New Zealand" to require that they be [[New Zealand permanent residency|permanent resident visa holder]]s. Resident visa holders are not considered "ordinarily resident in New Zealand" under this amendment. Clause 11 of the Act allows overseas persons to purchase residential land if it is used to increase the supply of housing in New Zealand. Properties built on land purchased under this pathway must not be inhabited by the owner and must be sold once they have been built.&lt;ref name="Bill Digest" /&gt;

The Overseas Investment Amendment Act would require overseas buyers to seek approval from the Overseas Investment Office to purchase hotel units if the land was classified as "residential" or "lifestyle." Overseas investors are allowed to purchase and own units in hotels with more than 20 units provided they enter into a lease-back arrangement with the hotel's developer or operator. The Act also allows network utility operators such as electricity and gas distributors, telecommunications companies, and transmission network operators to acquire land without consent for business purposes.&lt;ref name="Bill Digest" /&gt;

The Act allows overseas persons to take leases of up to five years over residential land that is not classified as "sensitive land." The Act also has provisions for introducing a "streamlined approval path" for businesses to either purchase residential land for non-residential purposes or for residential purposes to support a business. Such purchases would be subject to conditions imposed by the Minister of Trade and Export Growth to ensure that the land is being used for the purposes it was purchased for.&lt;ref name="Bill Digest" /&gt;

The Act also imposes a fine of up to NZ$20,000 for those failing to comply with the Act's sections. In addition, the Act also covers overseas investments in sensitive land that involve forestry rights and establishes new tests for consent where an overseas investment in sensitive land relates to forestry.&lt;ref name="Bill Digest" /&gt;

==History==
===Background===
The Overseas Investment Amendment Act 2018 was the result of an [[New Zealand property bubble|acute housing shortage]] in New Zealand during the early 21st century. In addition, national housing prices rose faster than incomes, with the gap rising from over 3.0 in January 2002 to 6.27 in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.interest.co.nz/property/house-price-income-multiples|title=Median Multiples - House price-to-income multiple|author=David Chaston|publisher=interest.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a report by the [[International Monetary Fund]] ranked New Zealand as the most unaffordable country in the [[OECD]] and recommended the taxation of property speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/money/2016/09/no-fix-for-housing-crisis-until-young-and-renters-vote---economist.html|title=No fix for housing crisis until young and renters vote - economist|author=Dan Satherley|date=2016-09-01|publisher=Newshub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/92365713/imf-says-housing-bubble-could-unsettle-strong-new-zealand-economy|title=IMF says housing bubble could unsettle strong New Zealand economy|author=Hamish Rutherford|date=2017-05-09|publisher=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the [[Demographia]] think-tank ranked Auckland's housing market the fourth-most unaffordable in the world — behind [[Hong Kong]], [[Sydney]] and [[Vancouver]] — with median house prices rising from 6.4 times the median income in 2008 to 10 times in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/business/322858/housing-in-many-nz-cities-'severely-unaffordable'|title=Housing in many NZ cities 'severely unaffordable'|author=Patrick O'Meara|date=2017-01-23|publisher=RNZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The housing shortage was a major issue during the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 general election]]. The incumbent [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] campaigned to build 200,000 houses over the next six years while the opposition [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] vowed to build 100,000 houses over the next decade as part of its [[KiwiBuild]] scheme. The populist [[New Zealand First]] promised to restrict foreign investment and the sale of houses and farmland to [[New Zealand nationality law|New Zealand]] citizens and permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gibson |first1=Anne |title=Election 17: Foreign restrictions, more new housing planned post-election |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11926080 |accessdate=26 August 2018 |publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour also campaigned on banning foreign speculators from buying existing houses, taxing property speculators, and making it easier for first-time buyers to purchase homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our plan to start fixing the housing crisis |url=https://www.labour.org.nz/housing |publisher=[[New Zealand Labour Party]] |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative passage===
Following the 2017 general election held on 23 September 2017, none of the parties in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] had enough seats to govern alone. After several weeks of negotiations, the Labour and New Zealand First parties formed a [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|coalition government]] on 19 October, with a [[confidence and supply]] agreement with the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/10/full-video-nz-first-leader-winston-peters-announces-next-government.html |title=Full video: NZ First leader Winston Peters announces next Government |author=Chapman, Grant |date=19 October 2017 |work=[[Newshub]] |accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/10/an-historic-moment-for-the-green-party-james-shaw.html |title=An 'historic moment' for the Green Party – James Shaw |author=Hurley, Emma |date=19 October 2017 |work=[[Newshub]] |accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 December, the Overseas Investment Amendment Bill was introduced by Labour Member of Parliament [[David Parker (New Zealand politician)|David Parker]].&lt;ref name="NZ Parliament" /&gt; On 19 December, the Bill passed its first reading in the with the support of Labour, NZ First, and the Greens parties while the opposition National Party voted against the bill (63:56).&lt;ref name="NZ Parliament" /&gt;

'''Compounding''' consists of preparing [[plastic]] formulations by mixing or/and blending [[polymer]]s and [[plastic additive|additives]] in a molten state, these blends are automatically dosed with fixed setpoints usually through feeders/hoppers. It is mostly a blend of [[copolymer]]s such as [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[Styrene-acrylonitrile resin|SAN]], [[Styrene maleic anhydride|SMA]] etc. with additives such as [[anti-oxidant]]s, [[UV-stabilizer]]s and other value adding agents and sometimes a strengthening component is added such as [[glass fibre]].

There are different critical criteria to achieve a homogenous blend of the different raw material. Dispersive and distributive mixing as well as heat are important factors.

Compounding is usually done by [[extrusion]]. The hopper feeds the begin of the screw which will gradually transport the [[resin]]s towards the die. The screw itself is confined in a barrel that has different zones that can be heated according to the resins properties.

Co-kneaders and twin screws (co- and counter rotating) as well internal mixers are the most common used compounders in the [[plastic industry]].

The [[extrudate]], which look like long plastic strands, are then cooled in a water bath, or by spraying as the conveyor belt moves it to the granulator.
The granulator breaks the strands into the desired pellet sizes.

'''Red Herring''' is a media company that publishes an innovation magazine, an online daily technology news service, technology newsletters and hosts events for technology leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redherring.com/about/ |title=About|work=Red Herring|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Herring is perhaps best known for its Red Herring Top 100 technology awards and the international conferences it hosts each year. The Red Herring Top 100 began in 1996 and highlights startup companies and private ventures in Asia, Europe and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anurag Mehra |url=http://www.redherring.com/top-100/ |title=Top 100 Overview|work=Red Herring|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Herring began as a technology business magazine in 1993 and flourished during the [[dot com boom]], with global distribution and bureaus in Bangalore, Beijing, and Paris. It also sponsored conferences designed to bring venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and technologists together. The magazine went into decline with the [[dot com crash]], and ceased print publication in 2003. It was relaunched in late 2004 under publisher [[Alex Vieux]] and editor-in-chief [[Joel Dreyfuss]], but again ceased print publication in 2007, continuing publication in digital form until 2011. Red Herring continues to publish technology sector news online.

==History==
Red Herring began as a magazine, founded in 1993 by a former banker named Anthony Perkins. Perkins named the magazine “Red Herring” after what bankers use to describe the prospectus for an initial public offering of stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6645320/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/red-herring-founder-tries-blogozine/#.UlW2P1BJNx6|title=Red Herring founder tries 'blogozine'|work=NBC News|date=3 December 2004|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication initially focused on the venture capital community and expanded its focus to include more of the technology sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/01/business/media/01MAG.html |title=Red Herring Magazine Closes|location=San Francisco|work=NY Times|date=1 March 2003|accessdate=5 December 2015|publisher=The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders sold stakes in the magazine to outside investors, but as the [[dot-com bubble|dot-com bust]] deepened, the magazine struggled, ceasing publication in 2003.&lt;ref name=mikeb/&gt; Later that year, Alex Vieux of Dasar acquired some of the company's assets. In September 2003, Vieux relaunched the Herring as a website with [[James Daly (journalist)|James Daly]] as Editor in Chief. The first official issue of the relaunched print publication was published in November 2004.&lt;ref name=mikeb&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mike Butcher|title=Red Herring Rejects Charges That Its Awards “Take Advantage” of Startups|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/19/red-herring-rejects-charges-that-its-awards-take-advantage-of-startups/|accessdate=5 December 2015|work=Tech Crunch|date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate history===
Perkins had previously founded ''[[Upside (magazine)|Upside]]'' magazine with [[Rich Karlgaard]] (who later became publisher of ''[[Forbes]]''). [[Chris Alden]] and Zack Herlick, friends since junior high school, had started a computer consulting company and taught computer science prior to partnering with Perkins.

Ron Conway, of [[Angel Investors (company)|Angel Investors]], was an early adviser and board member.

====Dot-com era====
Red Herring launched an event and an Internet division on the same day in May 1995 when Venture Market West premiered in [[Monterey, California]], accompanied by the company's first web site. The Venture Market series (including West, East, South, and Europe) ran successfully until 2001 and were accompanied by other events, such as NDA, Venture, and Herring on Hollywood.

The Internet operation grew steadily and peaked in 2000 when it acquired [[Stockmaster.com]].

[[Ziff Davis]] invested $2 million in Red Herring in 1997 for approximately 10% of the company, with Eric Hippeau, then CEO of ZD, joining the Red Herring board. Scott Briggs, a former president of Ziff Davis, joined the board in 1997 as well. [[Broadview Capital Partners]] invested $25 million into ''Red Herring'' in 2000, with Steven Brooks and Stephen Bachman joining the board.

''Red Herring'' was joined in the late 1990s by competitors such as [[International Data Group|IDG]]'s ''[[The Industry Standard]] ''and Imagine Media's ''[[Business 2.0]].'' It was also compared to ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'' magazine and ''[[Fast Company magazine|Fast Company]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com:8080/news2001/feb01/feb19/2_tues/news1tuesday.html|title=Business 2.0 is put up for sale|work=Media life magazine|date=1 February 2001|accessdate=5 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208080600/http://www.medialifemagazine.com:8080/news2001/feb01/feb19/2_tues/news1tuesday.html|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilary Schneider was hired by the board as CEO in late 2000 and succeeded Alden (who had succeeded Perkins as CEO).

''Red Herring's'' revenues reached nearly $100 million with a staff around 350, but contracted in 2001 and 2002. BCP invested in several additional rounds to help stabilize the organization, which went through several rounds of layoffs. Through these financings BCP obtained control of ''Red Herring'' and in 2002 put the company through an [[assignment for the benefit of creditors]] (ABC), which is a [[California]] state process similar to a federal [[bankruptcy]]. RHC Media, owned by BCP, bought the ''Red Herring'' assets out of ABC and kept the business operating.

After trying unsuccessfully to sell the company, RHC Media decided in early 2003 to cease operations and sell the company's assets. The subscription obligation was sold to [[Time Inc.]] and the Red Herring brand, URL, and Intellectual Property (such as back issues and online content) were sold to [[Alex Vieux]] of [[DASAR]].

====Purchase====
In April 2003, [[Alex Vieux|Vieux]], a French technology leader and entrepreneur, purchased the Red Herring brand with plans to revive the magazine. DASAR, French company led by Vieux, held a 20 percent stake in the undisclosed purchase price.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Victoria Shannon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/20/business/worldbusiness/20iht-vieux_ed3_.html |title=Red Herring looks to new tech boom - A dot-com magazine gears up for a revival|work=NY Times|date=20 October 2003|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vieux began hiring employees and refocusing the Red Herring brand out of offices in Mountain View, Calif. James Daly, founding editor in chief of ''Business 2.0'', was hired to head the Red Herring editorial staff.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; James Dreyfuss, a former editor of PC Week and Information Week, was hired as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref name="medialifemagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com:8080/news2005/jan05/jan24/2_tues/news2tuesday.html|title=Tuesday|work=Media life magazine|date=25 January 2005|accessdate=5 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208053948/http://www.medialifemagazine.com:8080/news2005/jan05/jan24/2_tues/news2tuesday.html|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bizjournals.com"&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2004/09/20/story7.html?page=all Bizjournals] 20 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Vieux vowed to make the magazine “systematically global”, focusing on influential technology companies large and small around the world. He refocused Red Herring’s targeted audience to C-level tech executives and international readers.&lt;ref name="medialifemagazine.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bizjournals.com"/&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt; 
&lt;/nowiki&gt;Building a solid editorial team and keeping costs low were also high priorities for Vieux during Red Herring’s revival. He claimed to have spent 20 percent less per weekly issue than publishers spent previously.&lt;ref name="medialifemagazine.com"/&gt;

====Post dot-com relaunch====
Shortly after the purchase by DASAR, the new owners brought in a team new editors with experience at competitors of the former print magazine.&lt;ref name="Masthead"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.org/article/the-red-herring-masthead/|title=The Red Herring Masthead|accessdate=2009-12-03|date=Sep 26, 2003|publisher=Paid Content|author=Ali, Rafat}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Red Herring'' re-launched as a web site in the fall of 2003.

Red Herring produced several test issues of the print magazine in the fall of 2004 and launched as a full-fledged weekly magazine in January 2005. The print edition came to an end in 2007, but a digital edition continued, available via the company's web site.

In recent years, Red Herring has been focused in actively promoting the events and awards for new innovative startups, venture capital scene and these events are branded as Red Herring Global 100, Red Herring North America 100, Red Herring Europe 100 and Red Herring Asia 100.

==Controversy==
Some noted critics say that the Red Herring Top 100 is a scam and companies are forced to pay a large fee to attend award ceremonies in order to receive the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techinasia.com/red-herring-awards-scam/ |title=The Red Herring Awards Scam|work=Techinasia|date=18 September 2012|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red Herring has objected to the criticism.&lt;ref name=mikeb/&gt;

The '''Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada''' ('''RTC''') is a government agency and the transit authority and the transportation-planning agency for [[Southern Nevada]]. It was founded by the [[Nevada Legislature]] in 1965.

==RTC Transit==
{{Main article|RTC Transit}}
The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) transit fleet consists of 37 routes served by 387 vehicles. In 2009, RTC Transit carried 57,738,930 passengers in the greater Las Vegas Valley. RTC Transit consists of 28 fixed route service routes, 7 express service routes, &amp; 2 Las Vegas Strip service routes such as The Deuce &amp; Strip &amp; Downtown Express (SDX).

==Services provided==
*RTC Transit - All public transportation routes available to the public.
*RTC Paratransit - Shared-ride, program for those who are functionally unable to use the RTC's fixed-route system.
*SIlverSTAR &amp; FDR - A service designed with senior citizens in mind with stops at senior community centers and areas.
*Mobility Training - One-on-one or group training program to help people with disabilities learn to use transit.
*Bike &amp; Ride - Learn how to use your bicycle and transit together.
*Transit Centers and Park &amp; Ride Facilities - Conveniently located transit centers and park &amp; ride facilities to help you get around with transit.
*Transit Ambassadors - Ambassadors along Las Vegas Blvd. answering questions for transit riders who may be new or just have a question about transit. 
*Heading to McCarran Airport? RTC Transit services to and from McCarran International Airport
*The RTC is a partner with the AAA Free Self-Driving Shuttle pilot program (with [[City of Las Vegas]] and [http://Keolisnorthamerica.com Keolis]). Visit [http://aaahoponlasvegas.com aaahoponlasvegas.com]

==RTC Rapid Transit and RTC Commuter Services==
In response to the ever increasing demand for faster service along the Las Vegas Valley's busiest roads, the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) has introduced the Gold Line that connects [[Downtown Las Vegas]] to the [[Las Vegas Convention Center]] and the [[Las Vegas Strip]].

The RTC also provides a commuter service that transports passengers from the Centennial Hills Transit Center and Park &amp; Ride in the northwest, to Downtown, the Strip, and ends at the [[UNLV]] campus in the southeast.

The Street Car RTV vehicles travel in dedicated lanes where possible, with less frequent stops than fixed-route transit, enabling the service to change routes based on traffic patterns and move passengers longer distances in a shorter time period than fixed-route bus service.

The bus rapid transit system is a seamless network of links throughout the [[Las Vegas Valley]] to various connection points of other transportation lines with more frequent stops and will have many rail-like features such as level platform boarding and multiple doors for easy loading. Riders wait at new, comfortable, and modern shelters that will compliment the bus rapid transit experience.  To help reduce wait times, you are able to purchase a Transit Pass off of the vehicle. This new rapid transit system has the appearance and feel of a light rail transit network at a considerably lower cost.

==Security==
Security on the residential, express, and strip transit routes, and all RTC terminals and select platforms is provided by the private security firm [[AlliedBarton|Allied-Barton]] under contract to the RTC. The previous contract holder was Wackenhut Security (now [[G4S Secure Solutions|G4S]]) until losing the contract in 2009. Since then, increased crime in the [[Las Vegas–Paradise, NV MSA|Las Vegas Metropolitan area]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cityrating.com/crime-statistics/nevada/las-vegas.html&lt;/ref&gt; has
prompted an increased security presence in the transit system as a whole. The officers primary task is that of fare enforcement, but will also engage in enforcing other RTC policies and rules, to include the removal of loiters, those causing disturbances, and those posing safety hazards at RTC stops and facilities, and insuring the general safety of staff and customers.

On December 15, 2014, a fatal shooting involving a transit security officer and Christopher Gene Boudinot occurred at the Paris Hotel and Casino stop at about 1:45am. Boudinot was removed from a bus for creating a disturbance. After lingering at the bus stop, he pulled a .45 caliber handgun and shot the officer several times. The officer returned fire and fatally shot Boudinot. The transit officer was rushed to UMC and eventually recovered while Boudinot was declared dead at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/landlord-never-saw-violent-side-man-killed-strip-shootout&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2874686/Bus-security-guard-kills-passenger-Vegas-Strip.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1642">'''Rockefeller Group''' is an American private company based in [[New York City]], primarily involved in real estate operations in the United States. It is a subsidiary of [[Mitsubishi Estate]] Co. The company began with the development of [[Rockefeller Center]].

After building the original {{convert|6000000|sqft|m2|sing=on}}, [[Art Deco]] complex from 1931 to 1939 (the company name was then the '''Metropolitan Square Corporation'''), the company developed several towers in the immediate vicinity from the late 1940s into the 1950s and 1960s. It entered into a partnership with [[Time Inc.]] and constructed a 48-story building for the company that opened in 1959; this spearheaded the expansion of the Center to the west of 6th Avenue, [[Avenue of the Americas]]. By the early 1970s, it had added a total of four [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] towers to Rockefeller Center, more than doubling the size of the original complex.

Today, Rockefeller Group maintains an ownership/management position in the {{convert|7700000|sqft|m2}} of office space that makes up Rockefeller Center’s western corridor (the newer buildings located west of Sixth Avenue). The eastern and original part of the Center is now owned by [[Tishman Speyer]] (who also serves as manager) and the [[Lester Crown]] family of Chicago, Illinois.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7166">In industry, '''total productive maintenance''' ('''TPM''') is a system of maintaining and improving the integrity of production and quality systems through the machines, equipment, processes, and employees that add [[business value]] to an organization 

TPM focuses on keeping all equipment in top working condition to avoid breakdowns and delays in manufacturing processes.

== History==
The term ''total productive maintenance'' is attributed to Nippondenso, a company that created parts for Toyota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.plant-maintenance.com/articles/tpm_intro.shtml|title = An Introduction tpm in www.plant-maintenance.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Seiichi Nakajima]] is regarded as the father of TPM because of his numerous contributions to TPM.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cetpm.de/downloads/nakajima/index.htm|title = Seiichi Nakajima - The Principles and Practice of TPM|website = www.cetpm.de|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==
One of the main objectives of TPM is to increase the productivity of a factory and its equipment with a modest investment in maintenance. [[Total quality management]] (TQM) and total productive maintenance (TPM) are considered as the key operational activities of the quality management system. In order for TPM to be effective, the full support of the total workforce is required. This should result in accomplishing the goal of TPM: "Enhance the volume of the production, employee morale and job satisfaction."&lt;ref name="2013-prabhuswamy-et-al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Prabhuswamy | first1=M | last2=Nagesh | first2=P  | last3=Ravikumar
 | first3=K  | title=Statistical Analysis and Reliability Estimation of Total Productive Maintenance | ssrn=2246601 | journal=IUP Journal of Operations Management | volume= XII | number=1 |date=February 2013 | pages= 7–20 | publisher=[[Social Science Electronic Publishing]] | location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objective of TPM is to increase the [[Overall equipment effectiveness|Overall Equipment Effectiveness]] (OEE) of plant equipment. TPM addresses the causes for accelerated deterioration while creating the correct environment between operators and equipment to create ownership.

OEE has three factors which are multiplied to give one measure called OEE&lt;br&gt;
'''Performance x Availability x Quality = OEE'''

Each factor has two associated losses making 6 in total, these 6 losses are as follows:

'''Performance''' = (1) running at reduced speed - (2) Minor Stops

'''Availability''' = (3) Breakdowns - (4) Product changeover

'''Quality''' = (5) Startup rejects - (6) Running rejects

The objective finally is to identify then prioritize and eliminate the causes of the losses. This is done by self-managing teams that solve problem. Employing consultants to create this culture is common practice.

=== Principles ===
The eight pillars of TPM&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seebo.com/total-productive-maintenance/|title=Industry 4.0 &amp; The 8 Pillars of Total Productive Maintenance|last=|first=|date=|work=Seebo|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; are mostly focused on proactive and preventive techniques for improving equipment reliability:

# Autonomous Maintenance
# Focused Improvement
# Planned Maintenance 
# Quality management
# Early/equipment management
# Education and Training 
# Safety Health Environment
# Administrative &amp; office TPM


With the help of these pillars we can increase productivity.
Manufacturing support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leanproduction.com/tpm.html|accessdate=7 March 2015|title=TPM-Total Productive Maintenance at LeanProduction.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
Following are the steps involved by the implementation of TPM in an organization:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

- Initial evaluation of TPM level,

- Introductory Education and Propaganda (IEP) for TPM,

- Formation of TPM committee,

- Development of master plan for TPM implementation,

- Stage by stage training to the employees and stakeholders on all eight pillars of TPM,

- Implementation preparation process,

- Establishing the TPM policies and goals and development of a road map for TPM implementation.

According to Nicholas,&lt;ref name=1998-nicholas&gt;{{cite book | last=Nicholas | first=John | year=1998 | title=Competitive manufacturing management | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; the steering committee should consist of production managers, maintenance managers, and engineering managers. The committee should formulate TPM policies and strategies and give advice. This committee should be led by a top-level executive. Also a TPM program team must rise, this program team has oversight and coordination of implementation activities. As well, it's lacking some crucial activities, like starting with partial implementation. Choose the first target area as a pilot area, this area will demonstrate the TPM concepts.&lt;ref name=1998-nicholas/&gt; Lessons learned from early target areas/the pilot area can be applied further in the implementation process.

In the UK foundry industry an implementation model was published in several Foundryman magazines by the Institute of British Foundrymen. Journal articles written by Toni Carannante CEng,  offer an implementation model with proven success and remain available from the Institute of Cast Metals Engineers (ICME).

== Difference from TQM ==
[[Total quality management]] and total productive maintenance are often used interchangeably. However, TQM and TPM share a lot of similarities, but are considered as two different approaches in the official literature. TQM attempts to increase the quality of goods, services and concomitant customer satisfaction by raising awareness of quality concerns across the organization.&lt;ref name=2008-wienclaw&gt;{{cite book | last=Wienclaw | first=R | year=2008 | title= Operations &amp; Business Process Management  | publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TQM is based on five cornerstones: The product, the process that allows the product to be produced, the organization that provides the proper environment needed for the process to work, the leadership that guides the organization, and commitment to excellence throughout the organization.&lt;ref name=1994-creech&gt;{{cite book | last=Creech | first=Bill | year=1994 | title= Five Pillars of TQM: How to Make Total Quality Management Work for You | publisher=E P Dutton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, TQM focuses on the quality of the product, while TPM focuses on the equipment used to produce the products. By preventing equipment break-down, improving the quality of the equipment and by standardizing the equipment (results in less variance, so better quality), the quality of the products increases. TQM and TPM can both result in an increase of quality. However, the way of going there is different. TPM can be seen as a way to help achieving the goal of TQM.{{citation needed|date = February 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1884">The '''tradable sector''' of a country's [[economy]] is made up of the [[industry sector]]s whose output in terms of [[goods and services]] are [[International trade|traded internationally]], or could be traded internationally given a plausible variation in relative prices. Most commonly, the tradable sector consists largely of sectors of the [[manufacturing industry]], while the non-tradable sector consists of locally-rendered [[service (economics)|services]], including health, education, retail and construction.&lt;ref name=ABS&gt;{{cite web|title=Feature Article - Australia's Tradable Sector|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/90a12181d877a6a6ca2568b5007b861c/35b008afa1aa680fca256fd90018897f!OpenDocument|work=Australian Economic Indicators|accessdate=2011-09-19|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61oKxRaY6|archivedate=2011-09-19|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tradable jobs can be performed by individuals outside a country: manufacturing, consulting, engineering, finance. Non-tradable jobs can realistically only be performed by domestic workforce: government, health care, hospitality, food service, education, retail, and construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Daniel|title=Nobel Laureate Spence: U.S. May Have to Live with Slow Employment Growth|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/nobeal-laureate-spence-u-may-live-slow-employment-144754933.html|publisher=Yahoo!

==Australia==
In 1990, Australia's sectoral outputs were 25.8% tradable and 74.2% non-tradable. Mining and manufacturing accounted for 18.3% and 61.4%, respectively, of the tradable sector.&lt;ref name=ABS/&gt;

A '''trustee in bankruptcy''' is an entity, often an individual, in charge of administering a [[bankruptcy]] estate.

== United States ==
In the United States, a '''Trustee in Bankruptcy''' is a person who is appointed by the [[United States Trustee Program]], a division of the [[United States Department of Justice]]. In limited circumstances, the creditors involved in a bankruptcy case can elect a trustee.

In a [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] Bankruptcy ("Liquidation") the trustee gathers the debtor’s non-exempt property, managing the funds from the sale of those assets, and then paying expenses and distributing the balance to the owed creditors.

In a [[Chapter 13]] Bankruptcy ("Reorganization") the trustee is responsible for receiving the debtor’s monthly payments and distributing those funds proportionally to the debtor's creditors. The Bankruptcy Trustee will act on behalf of the debtor to guarantee that both the creditors’ and the debtor’s interests are maintained in accordance with the bankruptcy laws, and will often be required to act as a negotiator between the two parties.

Since the 1990s, duties similar to those of a trustee are sometimes performed by an individual called a [[Chief restructuring officer]] (CRO), generally prior to, or subsequent to, a bankruptcy proceeding (generally, a Chapter 11 proceeding). A CRO is an official of the company who has direct contact with the creditors and who has executive power to implement changes. The advantage of using a CRO is that the arrangement gives both the creditor and debtor more say over the future of the company than might be the case where a Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee is appointed.

==Canada==

See: [[Bankruptcy in Canada]]

In Canada, a trustee in bankruptcy is an individual or a corporation licensed by the official superintendent to hold in trust and, subsequently, to distribute bankrupt’s property among the creditors in accordance with the distribution scheme under the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]] (BIA). The bankrupt and all other persons holding bankrupt’s property must transfer the property to trustee. The trustee may also assist individual in preparing and submitting a consumer proposal to creditors. The trustee must arrange mandatory counselling of the bankrupt. The trustee must follow the procedures under the BIA, call creditors meetings and send the parties required notices of proceedings and documents. The trustee is responsible for preparation of pre-discharge report and may oppose the bankrupt’s discharge.

'''Walter Hochschild''' (1901 &amp;ndash; February 2, 1983) was an American industrialist, having spent 63 years as an executive with the [[American Metal Company]] (later AMAX), founded by his father, [[Berthold Hochschild]].&lt;ref name=NMHOF&gt;[https://www.mininghalloffame.org/inductee/hochschild National Mining Hall of Fame: "Hochschild, Walter"]  retrieved November 29, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  He became president of the company in 1950 and chairman and chief executive officer in 1957.  He served as a trustee of the [[Museum of the City of New York]] for thirty years, and as a lifelong senior trustee of the United States Council of the [[International Chamber of Commerce]].

'''Álvaro Carlos Alsogaray''' (June 22, 1913 &amp;ndash; April 1, 2005) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] politician and businessman. [[Minister of Economy (Argentina)|Minister of Economy]] during much of the 1959-62 period, he was one of the principal proponents of [[neoliberalism|economic conservatism]] in modern Argentina.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Alsogaray was born in [[Esperanza, Santa Fe]], in 1913, as the eldest of three children to Julia Elisa Bosch and Álvaro Alsogaray. Born to a prominent local military family, Alsogaray graduated from the [[Colegio Militar de la Nación|National Military College]] as an infantry officer. He studied [[military engineering]] in the Army's School of Higher Technical Studies and [[civil engineer|civil]] and [[aeronautical engineering|aeronautical engineer]] at the [[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba|National University of Córdoba]]. He married Edith Gay in 1940, and had two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name=edith&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/610903-murio-ayer-la-madre-de-maria-julia-alsogaray|title=Murió ayer la madre de María Julia Alsogaray|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired from the army with the rank of [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] and with two [[engineer]]ing degrees, which led to his being called ''el capitán ingeniero''. He entered business, becoming an important contractor for [[State enterprise]]s such as FAMA (a predecessor of [[flag carrier]] [[Aerolíneas Argentinas]]), and briefly served as its director during the presidency of [[Juan Perón]], whose populist politics and policies would later be anathema to Alsogaray's thinking.&lt;ref name=golpe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/583935-alvaro-alsogaray-el-unico-golpe-justificable-fue-el-del-55|title=Alvaro Alsogaray: "El único golpe justificable fue el del 55"|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Revolución Libertadora|coup that removed Perón]] in 1955, he held the posts of Under-secretary of Commerce and Minister of Industry, and maintained numerous Peronist staffers at the Undersecretariat despite his support for the coup.&lt;ref name=golpe/&gt; He founded the Independent Civic Party in 1956; the party fared modestly in the [[Argentine general election, 1958|1958 elections]].

===President Frondizi and the two "winters"===
[[File:Alsogaray y Frondizi.jpg|thumb|left|Alsogaray and President Arturo Frondizi (''left''), who appointed the conservative businessman under pressure from the military.]]
To placate powerful agrarian interests and other [[conservative]]s, the otherwise progressive [[Arturo Frondizi]] named Alsogaray Minister of the Economy in early 1959.  Inheriting large trade deficits, Alsogaray sharply devalued the [[Historical exchange rates of Argentine currency|peso]] and imposed severe credit controls on Argentina's large public banks.&lt;ref name=p12&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-49222-2005-04-02.html ''Página/12'' :: El país :: Alsogaray no llegó al invierno {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Declaring that the economy "must go through winter",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/civmil/frondizi/1959.htm Todo Argentina: 1959 {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; the austerity measures were a boon to exporters - but caused consumer prices to double in 1959, and real wages and construction to fall by about 20%.&lt;ref name=crisis&gt;Lewis, Paul. ''The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism''. University of North Carolina Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting trade surplus and pro-growth policies pursued by Frondizi's unofficial point man on the economy, [[Rogelio Julio Frigerio]], both contributed to a robust recovery in 1960 and 1961.&lt;ref name=todofr&gt;[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/civmil/frondizi/index.html Todo Argentina: Frondizi {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=came&gt;[http://www.redcame.org.ar/index.php/came/noticia/1165 Cornide, Osvaldo. ''A 50 años de la asunción de Arturo Frondizi''. {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginalized in favor of Frigerio after the 1959 [[recession]] and deeply unpopular, Alsogaray resigned early in 1961. Frigerio had been President Frondizi's first choice for the critical Economy Ministry, an appointment thwarted by the military; Frondizi and Frigerio later founded the [[Integration and Development Movement|MID]], a political party centered around the need for accelerated development.&lt;ref name=todofr/&gt;&lt;ref name=came/&gt;

Frondizi's efforts to [[Arturo Frondizi#Foreign policy|mediate differences between the United States and Cuba]] ultimately resulted in a [[Coups d'état in Argentina#Coup of March 29, 1962|March, 1962, coup d'état]], and Álvaro Alsogaray was able to use the influence of his brother, General [[Julio Rodolfo Alsogaray|Julio Alsogaray]], to secure several ministerial and planning posts under Frondizi's military-appointed successor, Senate President [[José María Guido]]. Reintroducing many of his restrictive 1959 policies, as well as nearly worthless "Ninth of July" bonds, which were issued in lieu of cash payments to public employees and government contractors, the economy again slipped into severe recession; the trade balance improved, albeit the cost of depressed business investment.&lt;ref name=crisis/&gt;&lt;ref name=todofr/&gt;

===Later career and the rise of María Julia===
Out of power after the election of Dr. [[Arturo Illia]] in 1963, Alsogaray devoted himself to undermining the new administration, even during the vigorous economic recovery that followed. Finding allies in conservative business and media interests, the powerful [[Church-state relations in Argentina|Roman Catholic Church]], and his influential brother Julio, Alsogaray and other Illia opponents were successful.&lt;ref name=rock&gt;Rock, David. ''Authoritarian Argentina''. University of California Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/civmil/illia/index.htm Todo Argentina: Arturo Illia {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Revolución Argentina|1966 coup]] against President Illia, he was designated [[United States-Argentina relations|Ambassador to the United States]], a post he held until 1968.&lt;ref name=rock/&gt;

Alsogaray founded the 'New Force' in 1972, though like the Independent Civic Party, it fared poorly in the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|1973 elections]] that returned Perón to power. He was among the few conservative figures to publicly oppose the imminent [[March 1976 coup]],&lt;ref name=golpe/&gt; but largely supported the subsequent [[National Reorganization Process]].&lt;ref name=p12/&gt; As the dictatorship eventually yielded to calls for elections, he founded the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Argentina)|Union of the Democratic Centre]] (UCeDé) in 1982. Running as a right-wing, economically [[neoliberalism|conservative]] candidate on the latter ticket, he stood for the [[President of Argentina|Presidency]] in 1983 and 1989. Alsogaray received two million votes (10%) in his [[Argentine general election, 1989|1989 presidential bid]], behind only major party candidates [[Carlos Menem]] and [[Eduardo Angeloz]].

Continuing to enjoy a measure of support in [[Buenos Aires]]' affluent [[Barrio Norte, Buenos Aires|northside]], he and his daughter [[María Julia Alsogaray]] were elected the only two national [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|deputies]] for the [[Union of the Democratic Centre (Argentina)|UCeDé]] in [[Argentine general election, 1983|1983]], and he served until 1999. A vehement anti-Peronist and anti-socialist, Alsogaray forged an alliance with the late Juan Perón's [[Justicialist Party]] in 1989, following their nomination of pro-market Governor [[Carlos Menem]], and endorsed Justicialist candidate Eduardo Vaca that year in a tightly-contested seat in the [[Argentine Senate]] representing the City of Buenos Aires. Argentine Senators were [[indirectly elected]] at the time, and Alsogaray's endorsement in the electoral college gave Vaca the seat, despite the latter's coming in second to centrist [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]] candidate [[Fernando de la Rúa]].&lt;ref name=ln&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=692635 ''La Nación'' (April 2, 2005) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] granted Alsogaray an [[honorary doctorate]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees Honorary Doctoral Degrees at [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A vocal supporter of the era's [[privatization]]s, he prevailed on President Menem to appoint his daughter, María Julia, Secretary of the Environment, in which post she served from 1991 to 1999, and himself served in numerous consultative posts during the Menem presidency, endorsing the populist-turned-conservative president in his [[Argentine general election, 1995|1995 re-election bid]].&lt;ref name=p12/&gt; Among his most notable roles in this era was as director of a feasibility study in 1995-96 for the replacement of Buenos Aires' two international airports for an island terminal on the [[Río de la Plata]]; opposed by de la Rúa, who had been elected Mayor (and would later be President), the project never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/96/08/22/t-04201d.htm ''Clarín'' (August 22, 1996) {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; His UCedé party languished despite his renewed influence as much due to public mistrust of his policies, as because of rivalries in the party itself &amp;ndash; notably between his daughter and Adelina D'Alessio de Viola (whom he had Menem appoint as head of the [[Banco Hipotecario|National Mortgage Bank]]). Commenting on the dispute, he remarked that ''"would it that one's political party could do without affiliates...or women!"'' &lt;ref name=ln/&gt;

===Legacy===
Alsogaray, who perennially sought [[television]] airtime, lived out his last few years in seclusion. He lost his wife in 2004,&lt;ref name=edith/&gt; and died in [[Buenos Aires]] the following year at the age of 91.  Adamantly [[conservative]], he was of the opinion that, if anything, the 1976-83 dictatorship was too moderate.  He felt that some of the most brutal torturers during [[Dirty War]], such as [[Alfredo Astiz]], were "heroes," and even once attempted to use his influence over the Menem administration to have a monument built in their honor.&lt;ref name=p12/&gt;
